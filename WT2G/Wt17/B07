<title>GATT & NAFTA: The After-Effects -- Duplantier</title></head>

<h2>GATT & NAFTA: The After-Effects</h2></center>
<P>
 
The North American Free Trade Agreement (known as NAFTA) and the  
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (called GATT) are wreaking  
havoc on the U.S. economy, but it's not too late to save our sovereignty. 
   <P>
The American Coalition for Competitive Trade (known as ACCT) plans  
this month to file the first of several legal challenges to the NAFTA and  
GATT treaties and the $53 million bailout of Mexico. The Coalition is  
determined to block the implementation of these sovereignty-usurping  
treaties before they cause any more damage. Former U.S. Customs  
Commissioner William von Raab has signed on with the ACCT Lawyers  
Committee supervising the legal challenges, which is headed by  
America's Future Chairman Robert Morris. 
                       <P>
Two years ago, at an ACCT conference on NAFTA, von Raab predicted  
that passage of the trade agreement linking the Mexican and American  
economies would lead to "chaos on the border," and so it has. "Trucks are  
rolling across the Rio Grande by the thousands," ACCT reports, "many of  
them loaded with cocaine and other illegal drugs now being sold on the  
streets and in the school yards all across our country." Thomas Considine,  
director of the federal government's Drug Enforcement Administration.  
advised a Senate committee in August that drug gangs in Mexico could  
eventually rival the ruthless ring now operating in Colombia. According  
to the Washington Times, these gangs routinely rob Southern Pacific  
freight trains "carrying millions of dollars in consumer goods" hecho en  
Mexico and destined for the U.S. market. 
                                  <P>
A Congressional Joint Economic Committee reported that "Mexican  
imports to this country cost the United States 137,000 jobs" in the nine  
months following passage of NAFTA. Imports from Mexico have soared  
since then, perhaps tripling the job-loss figure. "Trade with Mexico has  
been a big factor in the expanding U.S. trade deficit this year," says trade  
correspondent Richard Lawrence in the August 1 8th Journal of  
Commerce. In the first six months of this year, "the U.S. posted an $8.5  
billion merchandise deficit in Mexican trade, compared with a $1 .1  
billion surplus a year earlier." 
                    <P>
A study by Vanderbilt University documents some of the specific  
consequences of NAFTA: tomato production down 25 percent in Florida,  
Scott Paper Company cutting more than 10,000 jobs worldwide prior to  
opening multimillion-dollar plants in Mexico, the virtual elimination of  
the apparel industry in the United States. Syndicated columnist Sam  
Francis says the impact of NAFTA can be measured in "the destruction of  
whole lives, careers and lifetime hopes . . . as plants relocate,  
communities vanish, neighborhoods stagnate and opportunities for  
Middle Americans gurgle away forever in the backwash of NAFTA's  
sweep through the American economy and society." 
                         <P>
The American Coalition for Competitive Trade is determined to  
document the true cost of NAFTA and GATT and to see that these  
treaties are revoked before that cost soars even higher. Their efforts may  
determine whether or not America remains a land of opportunity.

<title>Duplantier:  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS ADVOCACY GROUPS</title></head>

<h2>Federal Government Supports Advocacy Groups</h2></center>
<P>


   

[The U.S. Government awards more than $39 billion a year in grants to 
advocacy groups that most Americans would not support, if given a 
choice. That's $39 billion of our money to promote ideas we don't agree with!]
<p>
The American Association of Retired Persons (known as AARP) 
received more than $73 million in taxpayer funds in a single year. The 
National Trust for Historic Preservation raked in $7 million. The AFL-
CIO and the American Bar Association each garnered more than $2 
million. Neither the lawyers lobby nor any other group is entitled to such handouts, but they obviously have no scruples about asking for them. 
<p>"The financial cost to the taxpayer is far higher than the amount 
funneled to these organizations," say Marshall Wittrnann and Charles 
Griffin of the Heritage Foundation. "Each one not only lobbies for its 
contract or grant but also advocates for bigger, more expensive social 
welfare programs."
<p>
Wittmann and Griffin have no objection to privately funded advocacy. "It 
is an entirely different matter, however, to employ the coercive power of 
the federal government to force taxpayers to finance organizations which 
lobby Congress or other government entities." This practice is an affront 
to Americans of all political persuasions. "It is ever bit as unjust to force 
liberal taxpayers to fund organizations on the right as it is to force 
conservative taxpayers to finance organizations on the left." say 
Wittmann and Griffin. Taxpayers should not be forced "to underwrite 
advocacy with which they disagree."
<p>
Wittmann and Griffin argue that taxpayer funding of advocacy 
organizations is wrong on at least three levels: "It is fiscally irresponsible 
to spend federal revenues on activities that provide no meaningful return 
to American people. It is morally wrong for the government to take sides 
in any public policy debate by assisting the advocacy activities of an elite 
few. And it is logically wrong for the government to fund activities that 
often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures."
<p>
Our Founding Fathers took great pains to design a government that 
would discourage the growth of factions who seek to promote their own 
special interests without regard to the common good or the rights of 
other citizens. "Instead of restraining factions, however, the federal 
government today subsidizes them," say Wittmann and Griffin. "This 
distorts the political process by favoring one faction over another and by 
nourishing a network of special interests" committed to the growth of 
government.
<p>
Wittmann and Griffin call for "tougher laws" that would put an end to 
the subsidization of factions. They recommend that witnesses testifying 
before Congress "be required to divulge . . . whether they receive federal 
funds and, if so, for what purpose and in what amount." They insist that 
any organization receiving federal funds should be prohibited not only 
from lobbying, but also from maintaining "organizational ties to any 
entity that engages in lobbying activity." This, they say, is the only way 
to make sure that no American is "compelled to finance lobbying 
activities with which he disagrees."

<html><head><title> Duplantier:  MULTICULTURALISM A STEP BACK</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <brNovember 14, 1995 <br></i><hr><h2>Multiculturalism is A Step Back</h2></center><P>



[Multiculturalism is the new pet theory of academicians and policy 
planners, but the evidence indicates that cultural diversity often leads to 
social conflict, retards economic progress, and restricts personal 
freedom.]
<p>
                      

The freedom that leads to economic growth is more likely to be found in 
a homogenous society, says Gerald Scully of the National Center for 
Policy Analysis. "Economic freedom and rule of law are fundamental for 
high levels of economic growth," contends Scully. "Security of property, 
freedom of contract, and free market exchange promote capital formation 
and, hence. economic growth. A legal system based on law rather than 
men's whims stabilizes the rules under which resources are allocated." 
<p>Without individual freedom and a legal system that protects it, 
"transforming poor nations into rich nations is virtually impossible." 
says Scully. Poor nations are often characterized by cultural diversitv. 
which leads to "social conflict," a loss of freedom. and a stagnant 
economy.
<p>
All the various immigrant groups that came to America brought with 
them their "own culture, some elements of which were thought to be 
inconsistent with American values." Scully notes that. until recently, our 
national policy was "to homogenize immigrants -- to make them speak 
English and disabuse them of radical political beliefs." As long as we 
maintained this policy. we "managed cultural conflict better than the rest 
of the world." says Scully. "The tension of absorbing different cultures 
through immigration has been partly diffused because of institutions that 
protect individual freedom. and because attempts have been made to 
bring immigrants into the cultural mainstream."
<p>
The problem with multicultural societies is that "the ethnocentric 
differences of race, religion, ethnicity and language often lead to 
enmity." The violence in Northern Ireland. the separatist movement in 
Quebec. the terrorism in Palestine, the ethnic rioting in India -- all are 
manifestations of multicultural madness. "Even if different groups live 
together peacefully," Scully contends, "the lack of a common language 
and common norms reduces cooperation" and drives up the cost of 
commerce.
<p>
Imposing socialist policies can retard economic growth in any society, of 
course, but in multicultural societies "intergroup conflict may result in 
additional economic inefficiency, lower the growth rate, and even turn 
violent. Hostilities make property insecure. which slows the rate of 
capital accumulation. Eventually, in culturally diverse societies, one 
cultural group tends to dominate and to suppress violence and manage 
enmity." That domination generally takes the form of "discriminatory 
restrictions on occupational choice? denial of educational opportunities, 
licensing of trade, confiscation of land, nationalization of business, 
restrictions on property [and] exchange and mobilitv restrictions," all of 
which have an adverse economic impact on society as a whole.
<p>
Scully laments the passing of America's "melting pot" method of 
assimilating immigrants, which combined "disparate elements into a 
common substance." The common rights we shared as individuals, no 
matter what our ethnic origin, are now being replaced by "group rights." 
<p>This is a dangerous development, "because emphasizing our cultural 
differences may exacerbate intergroup enmity and lead to social 
breakdown."

Duplantier</a> <br>November 15, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>United Nations Repatriates Asian Refugees</h2></center><P>



       

[The United Nations High Commission on Refugees has long denied 
reports that it mistreats Asian refugees, forcibly returning many of them 
to the Communist countries from which they fled. But now former 
officials of the UN High Commission have come forward to confirm 
those reports.]
<p>
Officials of the United Nations High Cornrnission on Refugees and 
spokesmen from our own State Department persist in claiming that 
screening procedures for the Vietnamese and Laotian refugees detained 
in holding camps in Thailand. Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Indonesia are 
fair and orderly. They also maintain that the poor souls who have been 
repatriated have nothing to fear from the ruthless thugs who rule their 
homelands. These claims have now been challenged, however -- by 
former officials of the UN High Commission itself.
<p>
One such official is Simon Jeans, an Australian attorney who served as a 
legal consultant to the UN High Commission on Refugees in Indonesia 
in 1992. At a recent House of Representatives subcommittee hearing. 
Jeans testified to rampant corruption by the Indonesian officers in charge 
of the refugee camps. "Corruption in Indonesia was systematic," said 
Jeans. Bribes and sexual favors were the price paid for preferential 
treatment.
<p>
Another witness before the House subcommittee was Wa Vue. a leader of 
the Hmong tribal people of Laos. This tribe was an unwavering 
Arnerican ally during the Vietnam war, and its members were postwar 
victims of a violent campaign of genocide by the communist Lao 
government. More than l 00 000 Hmong have found sanctuary in the 
United States, but thousands more live in daily dread of repatriation as 
they languish in the holding camps in Thailand.
<p>
Wa Vue and his father, Vue Mai, were detained in one of those camps. 
Vue Mai was active in a resistance movement known as the United Front 
for the Liberation of Laos. Officials from the UN High Commission and 
the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok persuaded Vue Mai to give up this effort 
and return to Laos. In November 1992 a State Department 
representative, accompanied by Thai and UN officials. escorted Vue Mai 
to the border. He was to meet with Lao officials and arrange for the 
resettlement of a large number of Hmong refugees. In October 1993 he 
disappeared in Laos and has not been heard from since. On February 26, 
1995, the rest of the Vue clan -- except for Vue Mai's wife and his son, 
Wa Vue -- were rounded up and forcibly returned, presumably to suffer a 
similar fate.
<p>
"This tragic tale is further evidence that the United States should 
reexamine its role in refugee screening and treatment in Southeast Asia," 
argues James Tyson, president of the Council for the Defense of 
Freedom. "Contrary to State Department assertions, the House 
subcommittee hearing brought out further evidence that such screening 
is extremely unfair, corrupt, and often violent." Many of the refugees 
from tyrannical regimes in Southeast Asia were loyal allies of the U.S. 
during the Vietnam War, says Tyson. "We have a real obligation to see 
that they receive equitable hearings."

Duplantier</a> <br>November 16, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Anti-Poverty Program Supports Leftist Causes</h2></center><P>




[Every year on the weekend before Thanksgiving, American Catholics 
are asked to contribute to their Church's Campaign for Human 
Development (known as CHD). More and more Catholics are declining 
to do so, however, as they learn about the Campaign's strange support for 
radical, left-wing organizations.]
<p>
The Capital Research Center in Washington DC reports that the 
Campaign for Human Development. the antipoverty program of the 
American Catholic bishops. is not at all what the faithful have been led 
to believe it is. If American Catholics had had any idea where the money 
really goes, they would not have dumped more than $230 million into 
the CHD collection baskets over the past 25 years. "What they are not 
told. and what the bureaucrats at CHD do not want them to know." the 
Capital Research Center charges. "is that most of CHD's money goes to 
support liberal activists who use it teach people how to organize and 
agitate for more government spending programs."
<p>
Adding insult to injury. "CHD-funded activists are often openly 
disdainful of the teachings of the Catholic Church. Whose offerings they 
gladly accept." CHD's 25th anniversary conference, held three months 
ago in Chicago. provided a good example of the persons and policies 
unwittinglv promoted by pious parishioners. Conference participants 
were treated to speeches By "a Marxist college professor. pro-abortion 
and pro-gay rights activists. and a strident opponent of school choice."
<p>
The Campaign for Human Development "operates on the same 
assumptions as Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty," providing no 
incentives for "individual striving and responsibility." According to the 
Capital Research Center. "Rather than offer the poor the example of 
success, and guidance in achieving it. CHD explains why poverty is the 
system's fault and teaches how to radicalize institutions." Despite its 
claims of nonpartisanship, "almost all of its activities fall on the left -- 
often the far-left -- side of the ideological spectrum. CHD-funded groups 
invariably favor public policies that require state intervention and 
decision-making. And these build support for their positions by resorting 
to the rhetoric of class consciousness and the tactics of social conflict."
<p>
The Capital Research Center contends that "CHD has established a long 
track record of funding groups whose activities many Catholics would 
find repugnant." It also has a history of responding to the problems of 
society with solutions that "preclude genuine Christian social action. By 
concentrating on tried-and-failed methods of victimization and blame, 
CHD undermines the individual's capacity for spiritual, moral, and social 
renewal."
<p>
The Capital Research Center implores the American bishops "to initiate 
a desperately-needed overhaul of the Campaign for Human 
Development," urging them to "exercise active oversight, not rubber-
stamp decisions by CHD professional staff." If nothing else, the bishops 
should be "honest with parishioners about the aims and activities of 
CHD." In the meantime, if American Catholics want to know what 
they're contributing to, they'll have to conduct their own investigations.

FLYNN</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>November 17, 1995 <br></i><hr><h2>The Enduring Wisdom of John T. Flynn</h2></center><P>


[Noted journalist and author John T. Flynn warned more than 50 years 
ago that America was headed down "the road to Socialism. " His 
recommendations for averting disaster are just as valid today as they 
were then.]
<p>
In a book called The Road Ahead, published decades ago, the late John 
T. Flynn argued that Americans committed to fighting the creeping 
advance of socialism in our country must first "rid themselves of the 
moral intimidation which has been imposed on their minds." An excerpt 
from that book appears in a new compilation of Flynn's writing entitled 
Forgotten Lessons. published by the Foundation for Economic 
Education. Flynn noted that "the American system has been painted as 
something wicked. bungling. even brutal. while the Planned New World 
of the future will be filled with sweetness, light, and plenty." This false 
picture has had an impact not only on naive Americans, but also on 
those who ought to know better.
<p>
John T. Flynn observed that the choice before us is not "between a 
perfect system called Socialism and an imperfect system called 
Capitalism. It is a choice between two human systems both of which will 
inevitably have their imperfections because they are human. But the 
Socialist Planners do not concede this. Capitalism they present to us only 
in terms of its defects. But Socialism is painted only in terms of the 
wonderful things it is going to do some day." Citing the disastrous effects 
of Socialism in Russia. Germany. Italy. and Britain. Flynn reminded his 
readers that "the greatest and most efficient producing machine in the 
world is in [America]. This did not happen by accident " he asserted. "It 
is the result of the soil of freedom in which it grew."
<p>
Socialism was far advanced in America even in Fly’s day, and it has 
gained ground since then. Fort years later we are still confronted with 
the need to counteract what Fly called "the social disease that is 
destroying us." Flynn urged his countrymen to "stop apologizing for our 
Capitalist society." We should take no more steps down the road to 
Socialism. he said. and we should turn out of office any politician who 
tries to lead us in that direction. Flynn pointed out. Iong before Dan 
Quayle and Pat Buchanan. "that we are in a social war. and that we must 
fight it as such." He said we should "put an end to the orgy of spending 
that is rapidly bankrupt the nation," quit trying to plan our economy, and 
instead let "our free system of private enterprise operate at its fullest 
capacity."
<p>
John T. Flynn was a founding member of America's Future, the producer 
of this series of broadcasts, and a man of great wisdom and vision. Flynn 
advised his readers to rediscover their principles in the U.S. 
Constitution. the Declaration of Independence, and American history -- 
and use those principles "to dismantle the tyrant State in America and to 
build up once again the energies of a free people."

Duplantier</a> <br>November 20, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Clinton's Civil Service Reform Flawed</h2></center><P>



             

President Clinton has made much of his plan to "reinvent government, " 
but a prominent management consultant says the President's proposed 
reforms would only make matters worse.
<p>
President Clinton promised to overhaul the federal civil service so as "to 
make the entire federal government both less expensive and more 
efficient, and to change the culture of our national bureaucracy awav 
from complacency and entitlement toward initiative and empowerment." 
But Donald J. Devine. former director of the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management says that "this reinvention will weaken management. Iead 
to greater inefficiencies. dilute individual performance initiative. 
reinforce the culture of complacency. and make government less 
accountable."
<p>
In a Heritage Foundation report entitled "Making Government Work," 
Device argues that the President's proposed reforms downplay the 
importance of individual merit and performance and shift control over 
the executive branch from the President to federal bureaucrats and 
unions. "Instead of reinventing government." savs Devine, "Clinton's 
proposals would make things worse by transferring leadership to 
committees and unions and assuring weak executive leadership."
<p>
President Clinton's proposals ignore the key principles of "real 
government reform." says Devine. the first of which is to "keep the 
mission simple." To be successful. every government agency must have 
"a simple. clear mission with an imaginative leadership dedicated to that 
mission." Unfortunately. "government missions have become enormously 
more complex" than they used to be. and civil servants are now saddled 
with responsibilities that are ill-defined or contradictory. "Government." 
Devine insists. "can work effectively only when relatively few things are 
assigned unambiguously to a few institutions with sufficient esprit le 
corps to do them well."
<p>
Devine notes that our central government has "strayed far from its 
federalist roots" and recommends that its scope be strictly limited once 
again. "Functions properly performed by the states should be transferred 
back to them." he says. The federal government should also take 
advantage of the "reduced costs. greater efficiency, and improved 
management that flow from contracting work out to the private sector."
<p>
Devine calls for the reestablishment of "a true merit system." The hiring 
and promotion of civil servants must be based on "knowledge, skills, and 
abilities" once again. he says. The President and his department heads 
must accept and assert their responsibility for the activities of the 
executive branch. Devine notes that "the thrust of the Clinton reforms is 
to remove authority from the political and career executives . . . and 
transfer it to labor-management councils." This is foolish and 
irresponsible. says Devine. "Without political leadership. when the 
President gives an order, there is no reason to assume anything will 
happen down the line in the federal bureaucracy. That is why 
responsibility in current law rests with the political agency head." 
Devine argues that "effective government management requires strong 
agency leadership," which in turn requires straightforward missions and 
clear-cut performance standards.

Duplantier</a> <br>November 21, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Affirmative Action Discriminates Against Whites</h2></center><P>


   

[The debate over affirmative action and the alleged disparity in 
opportunities for whites and blacks overlooks one thing -- not all blacks 
are alike, and neither are all whites.]
<p>
In a recent Wall Street Journal editorial, former U.S. Navy Secretary 
James Webb pointed out that "differences among white ethnic groups are 
huge. fed by cultural tradition, the time and geography of migrations to 
the country, and . . . the tendency of white Americans to discriminate 
against other whites in favor of their own class and culture." Webb cited 
a 1974 study by the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research 
Center that divided white Americans into 17 distinct ethnic and religious 
backgrounds.
<p>
The study ranked these 17 separate groups according to their educational 
and financial status. and the results were not what you might have 
expected. "Contrary to prevailing mythology, the vaunted White Anglo-
Saxon Protestants were even then not at the top," said Webb. Jews in 
fact, led the list. followed by Irish. Italian. German. and Polish 
Catholics, in that order. Educational attainment and income levels 
within each group were consistent throughout the country which would 
seem to indicate that differences among the groups are "culturally rather 
than geographically based."
<p>
According to that 1974 study, white families at the top of this list earned 
nearly $5000 more per year than white families at the bottom. The 
income difference between whites and blacks as a whole, at the time. was 
less than $4000. The obvious conclusion, according to Webb, is that. 
"even prior to the major affirmative action programs, there was a greater 
variation within 'white America' than there was between 'white America' 
and black America. and the whites at the bottom were in approximately 
the same situation as blacks."
<p>
The whites at the bottom are the ones who have felt the brunt of 
affirmative action. at the very time when a shrinking industrial base and 
a declining public school system are diminishing their prospects for self-
improvement. But sympathy for their plight is not in fashion. "The 
prevailing attitude has been to ridicule whites who have the audacity to 
complain about their reduced status." said Webb. and to rationalize 
policies that discriminate against them as remedies for a "past wrong."
<p>
Webb says the working-class white male "sees a government system that 
seems bent on belittling the basis of his existence, and has established a 
set of laws and regulations that often keep him from competing His 
evermore-isolated leaders have mandated [a so-called] 'equal 
opportunity' bureaucracy in the military . government and industry . . . 
whose sole function is to report 'political incorrectness' and to encourage 
the promotion of literally everyone but him and his kind." The current, 
coercive celebration of "diversity" has no appeal to the white male at the 
bottom of the ladder. To him, diversity is "a code word used to exclude 
him . . . no matter the extent of his qualifications and no matter the 
obstacles he has had to overcome."

Duplantier</a> <br>November 22, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Unfunded Mandates Shackle States</h2></center><P>



           

[State governments used to agree to almost anything to get on the federal 
gravy train. Now that Washington is making them pay for the ride, some 
states want to get off that train.]
<p>
Unfunded mandates. That's what the uproar's about. It seems the federal 
government is imposing more and more obligations on state 
governments without providing the funds necessary to pay for them. and 
so the states have to come up with the money themselves. Having to raise 
millions of dollars to comply with federal regulations. Or divert funds 
from their own programs, does not sit well with state officials. It's 
patently unfair, and it's unconstitutional. But, in the short run, it may be 
a good thing. After all. the states raised few objections as long as federal 
mandates were fully funded and they might never have complained if 
they hadn't felt the pinch.
<p>
How did the states get themselves into this fix? Thomas Atwood and 
Chris West of the Heritage Foundation explain: "States succumb to the 
temptation of federal funds and buy into a program; the people and the 
state become dependent on it; Congress changes the rules of the game: 
and the state is directed actually to change its law or even its constitution 
in order to continue receiving the popular funding. Strings-attached 
programs can lead to the federal government's virtually dictating state 
law. Yet. all too often. states have been quick to bargain ~" a! their 
autonomy in pursuit of federal dollars."
<p>
Complying with the dictates of the federal government used to be seen as 
"a small price to pay for federal funding of popular state-implemented 
programs." say Atwood and West. "But now the federal share of that 
funding is decreasing while the mandates are becoming more numerous. 
complex. and expensive. Unfunded federal mandates and highly 
prescriptive federal programs have backed many states and localities into 
a fiscal comer. forcing them to sacrifice their own programs and 
priorities in order to comply with standards set by a distant federal 
government."
<p>
Now at long last. state officials are "challenging the authority of the 
federal government to impose these mandates. whether funded or not." 
They're monitoring the votes of their Congressmen on mandates. They're 
challenging the federal government's ever-widening interpretation of the 
Constitution's Comrnerce Clause. They’re accusing the federal 
government of violating the Tenth Amendment, which reserves to the 
states and the people all powers not expressly delegated to the federal 
government. And on occasion, they're just plain refusing to comply.

Atwood and West warn that "the centralization of power in Washington 
threatens to smother America's enterprise and liberty." But the battle is 
joined, and the tide may be turning. "The states have the power, the 
authority, the opportunity, and the responsibility to rein in an out-of-
control federal government," say Atwood and West. All they need now is 
the will to assert themselves, and the determination to stick to their guns.

Duplantier</a> <br>November 23, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Thanksgiving Reflections</h2></center><P>


                           

[Today is a day to give thanks. But gratitude doesn't always come easily.]
<p>
It can be difficult to be grateful to someone who offers what is good for 
us when what is good for us is not what we want. Often we are grateful 
for the wrong things, the things that spoil us instead of the things that 
make us strong. As children we may appreciate the teacher who forgoes 
homework assignments. the parent who slips us cash without demanding 
any labor in return. and the aunt who plies us with candy. As ignorant. 
penniless adults with mouths full of cavities we ma! take the longer 
view.
<p>
Making a list of the gifts we have received can be a good way to develop 
our sense of gratitude and to sharpen our ability to recognize the hidden 
benefits in things that have not come gift-wrapped. We might begin our 
survey by listing those things that we recognize immediately as gifts: the 
presents we receive for birthdays. the year-end bonuses. the winning 
lottery tickets. Then w e might list those things we take for granted but 
would recognize as gifts if we thought about it: our health. our talents. 
the perfect weather for last weekend's picnic. Next, a list of rights. 
which. if we're honest. we will concede are not rights at all but privileges 
or gifts: life. liberty, property.
<p>
Last. we might list those burdens that -- if we think long and hard 
enough -- will be seen to provide some unexpected benefits and to 
constitute blessings in disguise: those long commutes that allow us time 
to plan and to reflect. the financial reverses that force us to draw closer 
to our families in a common struggle. the personal calamities that plumb 
the depth of our character.
<p>
Having prepared a comprehensive list of gifts received -- one that 
includes not only the obvious gifts. but also the ones we take for granted. 
the ones we think of as being rightfully ours. and even the ones we are 
accustomed to think of as burdens -- it remains only to determine the 
source of all these gifts and to select an appropriate response for 
communicating our appreciation. We will find that. just as the majority 
of our gifts have not come wrapped, so too have they arrived without 
labels identifying the giver. And yet. those of us who are not determined 
to be dense will readily acknowledge Who is the source. direct or indirect      
of all gifts.
<p>
But how will we show appreciation to Him? The best way is by putting 
the gifts He has given us to good use. The familiar parable of the talents 
suggests that it is not enough to reach the end of our journey merely with 
the gifts He has given us intact. We are meant to develop our aptitudes. 
invest our graces wisely!. make the most of our opportunities, and 
overcome the obstacles that confront us. That's what Thanksgiving is all 
about.

Duplantier</a> <br>November 24, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Spies Elude U.S. Security</h2></center><P>

[The John Walker spy case shocked America. How did Walker manage to 
steal so many of our county's secrets and pass them on to the Soviets for 
18 years without being detected?]
<p>
How did John Walker get away with his treacherous activities? The 
answer is simple: "The U.S. security system does not work." <p>That's the 
conclusion of George P. Morse, a security consultant with half a century 
of experience. Morse considers it likely that "American secrets are still 
being compromised in ways similar to those which John Walker found so 
easy and effective to employ, for there is really no effective U.S. 
government security system in place to stem the hemorrhaging." In a 
new book called America Twice Betrayed Morse concludes that our 
nation's security system is "unsound and unworkable and should be 
abolished and replaced."
<p>
A veteran of 30 years' service with the OSS and CIA, Morse contends 
that the apprehension of spies like Walker has resulted more often from 
luck than vigilance. "The great majority of spies and enemy agents have 
actually been uncovered by accident." he observes, "or through exposure 
by the subject's relatives or defectors from the intelligence services of 
other nations. They have not generally been uncovered by our official 
government security, investigative. or intelligence systems." In fact. says 
Morse. "the way security has traditional v been conceived and organized 
by the U.S. government makes it virtually impossible to protect our 
secrets."
<p>
In his book. America Twice Betrayed. Morse proposes a new system of 
U.S. government security to "remedy many of the failures of the past 
[and] at the same time substantiallv reduce both the monetary and 
human costs associated with security." What is needed, says Morse, is "a 
total rethinking of our basic approach to security." His first step would be 
to eliminate the "wasteful and counter-productive" full field investigation 
of all applicants for federal employment. Such an investigation "creates 
the illusion that the people investigated and then 'cleared' will always be 
loyal and honest." says Morse. "It provides a false sense of security 
which enables management and staff to avoid [their obligation to 
maintain] constant vigilance."
<p>
Instead, Morse would require the applicant "to offer proof of both 
suitability and trustworthiness and loyalty." Standard reference checks 
would be followed by an intensive interview. drug-screening. and a 
polygraph examination. "Polygraph tests -- and the fear of having to 
undergo one -- are arnong the few really effective tools available to the 
government to deter and detect treason or prevarication." Says Morse, who argues that "applicants seeking government employment and security 
clearance must, as a condition of their employment, accept reasonable 
limits of privacy and their constitutional rights against self-
incrimination."
<p>
Morse also calls for the development of "an appropriate and 
comprehensive set of standards that state concretely what is and what is 
not acceptable to qualify for a U.S. government security clearance." The 
most pressing need. however, is for a dramatic improvement in "the 
abysmal quality of management exercised by the Executive Branch from 
the President on down."

[They're convinced they can solve all the world's problems if we just do 
what they say. No matter how messed up their own lives are, no matter 
how much they disrupt the lives of others, those dauntless do-gooders 
never stop believing that they know what's best for the rest of us.]
<p>
The do-gooders jump from cause to cause, dictating solutions that betray 
ignorance of the problem at hand and total disregard for the consequences 
of their proposals. They don't seem to care whether their policies and 
practices really work or not. Why, then, do they do what they do? <p>Don't 
let their lofty rhetoric fool you. What do-gooders are really after, says 
syndicated columnist Thomas Sowell of the Hoover Institution, is "ego 
gratification " By making us feel bad, they make themselves feel good.
<p>
Sowell cites many examples. "Recycling, drug education, sex education, 
animal rights, gun control, multiculturalism. environmentalism and 
innumerable other social crusades produce far more benefits to the 
crusaders than for society,. In many cases, they make society worse off," 
says Sowell. "Studies have repeatedly shown recycling does more harm 
than good, and much evidence suggests that the actual consequences of 
both drug education and sex education are nil, at best."
<p>
Do-gooders don't care if recycling causes more ecological damage than 
the original manufacturing process. They don't care if drug and sex 
education programs encourage experimentation. They don't care if gun 
control increases violence. They don't care if multiculturalism 
exacerbates racial tensions. Do-gooders don't care how things really 
work, or what the truth is. Their sole concern is to "make a statement." As 
Sowell points out. "there is no need to check out facts if the real point is 
moral preening."
<p>
Do-gooders have plagued mankind with their coercive correctives for 
hundreds of years. "In the l 9th century, housing reform in the cities was 
the big crusade," says Sowell, "especially in the slums occupied by 
recently arrived immigrants. Though many immigrants lived in crowded 
quarters in run-down neighborhoods because they had no choice, others 
doubled up and scrimped to save money to send to their families back in 
the old country. Some saved to prepare for a better future."
<p>
It's too bad that the do-gooders couldn't leave well enough alone, but it's 
in their nature to interfere. They felt compelled to save those poor souls 
from themselves. "Reformers decided that people needed more space per 
person and wrote that into laws, thereby raising the cost of housing to the 
immigrants," says Sowell. "People were forced to spend their money not 
on what their own top priorities were, but on what the anointed 
busybodies decided was best for them."
<p>
Such meddling has gone on for millennia. Sowell understands the 
syndrome and accepts it as a fact of life, observing that "the real question 
is not why some people treat public policy as exercises in ego 
gratification. The question is why the rest of us listen to them so 
gullibly."

Duplantier</a> <br>November 28, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Public Schools are a Dismal Failure</h2></center><P>
[It's time to face up to the failure of our nation's educational system. A 
Nobel Prize-winning economist argues that the only way to save the 
public schools is to privatize them.]
<p>
"Our elementary and secondary educational system needs to be radically 
reconstructed," says Nobel economist Milton Friedman of the Hoover 
Institution. The system is hopelessly defective, and the "technological 
and political revolutions of the past few decades" are only going to make 
it worse. Friedman predicts that "a widening gap between the incomes of 
the highly skilled . . . and the unskilled" will lead to "serious social 
conflict. "
<p>
Friedman points out that dramatic technological advances have "made it 
possible for a company located anywhere in the world to use resources 
located anywhere in the world, to produce a product anywhere in the 
world, to be sold anywhere in the world." Equally dramatic political 
changes in Eastern Europe and Latin America have led to the widespread 
rejection of central planning in favor of free markets and "added greatly 
to the pool of low-wage, yet not necessarily unskilled labor" with which 
U.S. workers must compete. These developments have put "downward 
pressure on the wages of low-skilled labor," widening the income gap in 
America. If this gap continues to widen, "it threatens to create within our 
own country a social problem of major proportions," warns Friedman. 
<p>"Such stratification is a recipe for social disaster." Only a dramatically 
improved school system can brighten the prospects of Americans at the 
bottom of the economic ladder.
<p>
Friedman argues that "radical reconstruction can be achieved only by 
privatizing a major segment of the educational system." To encourage "a 
gradual yet substantial transfer from government to private enterprise." 
<p>Friedman recommends "a voucher system that enables parents to choose 
freely the schools their children attend." He concedes, however, that "the 
political power of the school establishment" has been, and will continue 
to be, a major obstacle to this effort.
<p>
Central city residents suffer most from the poor quality of public 
schooling. "The reason is partly the deterioration of our central cities, 
partly the increased centralization of public schools." says Friedman. 
<p>"Power has moved from the local community to the school district to the 
state, and to the federal government. About 90 percent of our kids now go 
to so-called public schools. which are really not public at all but simply 
private fiefs primarily of the administrators and the union officials."
<p>
Friedman insists that everyone will benefit from a voucher system, 
"except a small group of vested interests." The big winners will be "the 
residents of central cities, who will have a real alternative to the wretched 
schools so many of their children are now forced to attend." That "small 
group of vested interests" has tremendous clout, however. <p>"The teachers' 
unions are bitterly opposed to any reform that lessens their own power," 
says Friedman, "and they have acquired enormous political and financial 
strength." They won't hesitate to use that strength to defeat "any attempt 
to adopt a voucher system."

<html><HEAD><TITLE>Duplantier:  LEGALIZED GAMBLING DESTROYING COMMUNITIES</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>November 29, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Legalized Gambling Destroying Communities</h2></center><P> 
 
[The social and economic havoc that legalized gambling is wreaking on  
communities throughout our country could have been avoided, if only  
Americans had learned the lessons of history.]  
  <p>
"On the whole, legalization of gambling in the United States has failed  
completely. Instead of eliminating abuses, it increased them . . .  
legalization attracted criminals." That's the conclusion of Virgil Peterson,  
onetime director of the Chicago Crime Commission. Mr. Peterson made  
those remarks in the 1950s, but they're even more appropriate today, now  
that state lotteries and gambling casinos have sprouted up all over the  
country.  
  <p>
"Commercialized vice and gambling have always been the principal  
props of the underworld," said Peterson, more than 40 years ago. "The  
intrinsic character of gambling naturally attracts the criminal element.  <p>
The kidnapper, the armed robber, the burglar, and the thief engage in  
their criminal enterprises for the purpose of obtaining money without  
working. Gambling establishments appeal to this type of individual."  
  <p>
In 1956 a New Orleans newspaper published a series of editorials  
reminding its readers of the many social ills that inevitably result when  
commercial gamblers are allowed to gain a foothold in a community.  
New Orleanians should have known better. After all, the city had had a  
long history of legal and illegal gambling and the dire consequences were  
a matter of public record. "Those who cannot remember the past are  
condemned to repeat it," said the philosopher George Santayana, and he  
might have added that there are always sharpies in the shadows waiting to  
cash in on our short memories.  
  <p>
The editorial writer for the New Orleans paper argued that "commercial  
gambling breeds official and political corruption. It is the incubator of the  
racketeer and the gangster." How do gambling interests gain a foothold?   <p>
What happened more than 40 years ago in Phenix City, Alabama typifies  
their methods: "The gamblers moved in, with the sanction of some  
officials. The bribe money looked good to them. They let more gamblers  
in. But the gambling profits looked even better. They moved in with the  
gamblers." Greed knows no limits, however. "Big, easy profits make big  
spenders. Big spenders seek bigger profits, and, eventually, some  
insurance that their profits will continue." Wherever the professional  
gambler operates, "he amasses a huge fortune which he eventually uses to  
influence government so as to insure not only his continued prosperity  
but an even greater one."  
  <p>
The newspaper warned that "the crime that gambling breeds is not  
confined to the professional gamblers. Infected also are hopeless  
gamblers. Like the dope addict, the gambling addict finds his fleeting  
thrills expensive. Money earned through lawful means rarely can support  
his pleasures. He turns to crime, to stickups, to burglary, to  
embezzlement, to white slavery, even to murder, for the fast buck that he  
needs to indulge himself."  
  <p>
Today's racketeers may have MBAs and designer suits, but they're still  
racketeers, and their activities are sucking the lifeblood out of our local  
economies and breeding vice. How much damage will they have to do  
before we send them packing?

Duplantier</a> <br>November 30, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>PC on Campus Hinders Pursuit of Truth</h2></center><P>
[The search for truth is getting to be a risky business.  Just ask any  
college student who's run afoul of the thought police on campus.]   
  <p>
There's no longer any use in denying it. The temples of learning have   
become indoctrination centers. Academic freedom has given way to mass   
hysteria. A bizarre misanthropic cult now reigns supreme on American   
college campuses. "Political correctness has been used to enforce   
conformity and to stifle debate," say Peter Duignan and L.H. Gann of the   
Hoover Institution. "Censorship is practiced in a variety of ways. through   
the planned disruption of meetings, the use of so-called speech codes, and   
the coercive use of sensitivity training or suspension from school.   
<p>Indirect censorship is also practiced through the selection of assigned   
reading and also through hiring practices."  
  <p>
The puppets of political correctness reject the European focus of   
American history, ignoring the fact that "the United States is, for the   
greater part, a demographic and cultural extension of Europe beyond the   
Atlantic. About four-fifths of the US population derives from European   
stock," say Duignan and Gann. "The United States owes a cultural debt to   
almost every land under the sun," they concede. "But no other country   
influenced the United States as much as Great Britain." Our language, our   
literature, our legal system, our system of government, our ethical system   
-- all have British origins.   
  <p>
The PC crowd insists on a growing array of ethnic studies programs to   
remedy the alleged racial bias of Western scholarship. They're unwilling   
to accept the fact that the United States is a product of Western   
civilization. with pronounced European characteristics -- characteristics   
that include a unique appreciation for cultures other than its own. <p>"Far   
from being one of the world's most oppressive societies, the United States   
is the most successful multiracial and multiethnic state in existence," say   
Duignan and Gann. "No other country attracts as many immigrants and   
bestows its citizenship on so many newcomers. No other country is   
ethnically more varied."  
  <p>
Purveyors of political correctness claim that the West has had a uniformly   
negative impact on lesser developed countries. On the contrary.   
"mainland has gained in the long run by the Western conquest of the New   
World and by the consequent emergence of new nations," say Duignan   
and Gann. "Modern industrial civilization allows not only higher   
economic productivity! than its early predecessors but also an infinitely   
larger population and higher material well-being and a longer life," not to   
mention "an infinitely larger number of choices."  
  <p>
In their eagerness to condemn the United States as a racist and sexist   
society. the PC partisans willingly ignore the numerous alternative   
explanations for economic inequities -- such as the median age of ethnic   
groups. cultural and genetic differences. and so on. They also maintain   
that America is not the free country we have all been "brainwashed" to   
believe it is. That they themselves are the ones who have been   
brainwashed. that the PC movement itself threatens the liberties of all   
Americans -- such ironies are lost on this humorless horde.

Duplantier</a> <br>December 1, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>NAFTA Bad for American Workers</h2></center><P>

[It is estimated that nearly one million Americans lost their jobs this year 
as a direct result of the North American Free Trade Agreement (known as 
NAFTA). How many more American workers will have to suffer the 
same fate before our leaders admit they made a mistake?] 
 <p>
NAFTA has taken a terrible toll on the American economy, and the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as GATT) will only 
make matters worse, says William Gill of the American Coalition for 
Competitive Trade. Gill points out that "the United States is currently 
running record trade deficits with Mexico, after years of chalking up 
trade surpluses against that country." Of even greater concern is "the 
continued migration of our industrial plants to Mexico, which every day 
robs us of more jobs." An estimated one million jobs will have been lost 
by the end of this year. In spite of their rosy, pre-NAFTA predictions, 
giant American companies like Mattel, Allied Signal, General Electric. 
Procter & Gamble, Scott Paper, and Zenith have failed to create the 
thousands of new jobs in the United States that they promised. Instead, 
they have laid off American workers. 
 <p>
NAFTA hasn't done Mexico and Canada any good either, says Gill. "In 
Mexico, hundreds of thousands of poor farmers are being driven off the 
land and the middle class is collapsing under interest rates which in some 
cases are well over 100 percent. Conditions have become so bad in 
Canada that several western provinces . . . are threatening to secede." Gill 
says that Mexico is in "a state of chaos since NAFTA." Drug trafficking 
is on the rise, crime is burgeoning, farmers are in revolt. "The collapse of 
the peso drove hundreds of small businessmen into bankruptcy," says 
Gill.  "The job losses have been tremendous, in spite of the growth of 
exports to the U.S." Nearly 60 percent of the Mexican workforce is 
unemployed. 
 <p>
As Mexico's internal problems worsen, they pose a growing threat to the 
health and security of the United States. "Even before NAFTA, Mexico 
was the principal conduit for cocaine coming into the U.S. from 
Columbia and other Latin American countries," and the volume has 
increased substantially ever since. "Crime, rampant in Mexico for 
decades, has spilled across the border like a tidal wave in the last two 
years." 
 <p>
William Gill contends that "the American people, like the Mexicans and 
Canadians, have all been made the victims of a gigantic fraud -- the 
biggest scam in history." He argues that there is "only one way to halt the 
insanity  NAFTA and GATT are spreading across America and around 
the world. And that is to roll back both of these fraudulent treaties." Gill 
insists that "NAFTA must be abrogated. America and Mexico cannot 
keep on absorbing the terrible punishment this treaty has inflicted upon 
the people of both countries." 
 <p>
Gill's group, the American Coalition for Competitive Trade, is filing 
several legal challenges to NAFTA and GATT and the $53 billion bailout 
of Mexico. The Coalition wants to block the implementation of these 
treaties before they cause any more damage to our sovereignty and to our 
economy.

Duplantier</a> <br>December 4, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Anti-religious Bigotry Rampant in Hollywood</h2></center><P>
[A new documentary offers numerous examples of the anti-religious 
bigotry that is rampant in Hollywood.] 
 <p>
"For years now, the entertainment industry has attacked our faith and 
undermined our value system," observes Dr. James Dobson of Focus on 
the Family, in his introduction to a new documentary entitled Hollywood 
vs. Religion. "The entire Judeo-Christian tradition is ridiculed." The 
hour-long video tape is narrated by Michael Medved, New York Post 
film critic and co-host of the PBS program called Sneak Previews.  He 
examines more than 50 contemporary films that lampoon the religious 
beliefs of the American people. Unfortunately, this is just a sampling.  <p>
"There are a great many other movies that also mock our faith," says 
Dobson. 
 <p>
According to Medved, Hollywood's hostility toward religion is a fairly 
recent development. Showing heartwarming scenes of Spencer Tracy in 
Boys Town, Bing Crosby in The Bells of St. Mary's, and Julie Andrews 
in The Sound of Music.  Medved notes that "this tradition of taking a 
positive view of the clergy and the faithful continued well into the l960s." <p>
But the film world has lost its fondness for the faith.  "Today, by contrast, 
moviemakers will stretch to insert images of vicious clergymen or crazed 
killer Christians,'' says Medved.  They'll even go so far as to introduce 
vicious stereotypes into remakes of old films -- such as The Blob and 
Cape Fear -- where none existed before. 
 <p>
What are the stereotypes? Here's how Hollywood views the world of 
religion: "The Catholic Church is linked to the Mafia. Evangelical 
believers are suckers and dupes. In their hearts, many Christians want to 
take over the country and establish a dictatorship. Orthodox Jews are 
hypocrites.  Agnostics, on the other hand, are wise, wonderful people." <p>
Hollywood will bend over backwards not to offend the fringe elements of 
society, but the cherished beliefs of the vast majority of Americans are 
fair game. "Only the sensibilities of mainstream Western religious groups 
are repeatedly ignored." says Medved. "And many films send the 
unmistakable message that higher truth can only be found outside the 
teaching of all organized faith." 
 <p>
Everything in Hollywood is carefully calculated, says Medved, and that 
includes the anti-religious imagery that we are seeing more and more of: 
"It's no accident when filmmakers show us so many villains who happen 
to be religious," he observes.  Why do they do it?  Directors and 
producers like to claim that they're only giving the public what it wants, 
but the box-office failure of such offensive movies as The Last 
Temptation of Christ puts the lie to this claim. More than three dozen 
films featuring repugnant religious stereotypes have come out of 
Hollywood in recent years. "Almost all of these movies ended up losing 
money," says Medved. The real reason that such films continue to be 
made is that they reflect the mindset of a "tightly knit community whose 
members happen to share some similar, unspoken values and biases. And 
one of those biases involves sincere and deep-seated contempt for 
organized religion."

Duplantier</a> <br>December 5, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Legal Redistribution of Wealth Unjust</h2></center><P>
[Our legal system can be just, or it can be philanthropic, but it cannot be 
both.] 
 <p>
"Self-preservation and self-development are common aspirations among 
all people. And if everyone enjoyed the unrestricted use of his faculties 
and the free disposition of the fruits of his labor, social progress would be 
. . . uninterrupted," observed the l9th Century French economist Frederic 
Bastiat in a small book titled "The Law," published in 1850. "But there is 
also another tendency that is common among people. When they can, 
they wish to live and prosper at the expense of others." 
 <p>
In order to live, legally, at someone else's expense, it is necessary to turn 
the law into "an instrument of plunder." No matter how noble the 
justification, once the premise is accepted that a government can 
expropriate the wealth of some of its citizens and dispense it to others, 
theft has been legalized, and the signal has been sent -- to haves and 
havenots alike -- that nothing is secure. Bastiat considered this the 
greatest evil to which any society can be subjected, but recognized it as 
the ultimate goal of all greedy men and do-gooders. The ill effects of 
such a transformation are predictable. When the law ceases to be just, 
respect for it diminishes, and society suffers.  "The safest way to make 
laws respected is to make them respectable," said Bastiat. "When law and 
morality contradict each other, the citizen has the cruel alternative of 
either losing his moral sense or losing his respect for the law." 
 <p>
Bastiat argued that "the most peaceful, the most moral, and the happiest 
people" in the world are to be found in "countries where the law least 
interferes with private affairs; where government is least felt; where the 
individual has the greatest scope, and free opinion the greatest influence; 
where administrative powers are fewest and simplest; where taxes are 
lightest...." Their bliss shall continue only so long as each citizen 
remembers that "the existence of persons and property preceded the 
existence of the legislator, and his function is only to guarantee their 
safety." 
 <p>
Inevitably, though, there will be some who think they are better than the 
rest of us. "Too many persons place themselves above mankind," said 
Bastiat; "they make a career of organizing it, patronizing it, and ruling it." <p>
But mankind does not need their help. "God has given to men all that is 
necessary for them to accomplish their destinies." Bastiat had no use for 
"quacks and organizers . . . with their artificial systems!" He denounced 
"the whims of governmental administrators, their socialized projects, 
their centralization, their tariffs, their government schools, their state 
religions, their free credit, their bank monopolies, their regulations, their 
restrictions, their equalization by taxation, and their pious moralizations!" 
 <p>
Bastiat's challenge to the do-gooders bears frequent repetition: "You who 
think that you are so great! You who judge humanity to be so small! You 
who wish to reform everything! Why don't you reform yourselves?"

<html><HEAD><TITLE>Duplantier:  SOCIALISM'S CONTINUING APPEAL
</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>December 6, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Socialism's Continuing Appeal</h2></center><P>
[Socialism makes no economic or intellectual sense. How, then, do we 
explain its continuing appeal?] 
 <p>
"Thanks to its promise of regeneration, thanks to the hope it flashes 
before all the disinherited of life, socialism is becoming a belief of a 
religious character rather than a doctrine." Thus concluded French social 
psychologist Gustave Le Bon in a book entitled "The Psychology of 
Socialism," published at the turn of the last century. The dream of 
socialism is "to substitute itself for the ancient faiths," said Le Bon. It 
seeks to do so by appealing to "the sentiments of envy and hatred which 
it creates in the hearts of the multitudes. To the crowd, no longer satisfied 
with political and civic equality, it proposes equality of condition." 
 <p>
Socialism is a form of collective fatigue, a kind of mass despair. 
Energetic peoples have no use for it. Thriving cultures are characterized 
by "a considerable extension of what is confided to personal initiative, 
and a progressive reduction of all that is left to the state to perform." In 
worn-out cultures, that is, cultures on the decline, "the government is 
always a power absorbing everything, manufacturing everything, and 
controlling the smallest details of the citizen's life." 
 <p>
Le Bon argued that all forms of  government enshrine one or the other of 
"two different and opposing fundamental principles -- individualism and 
collectivism. By individualism, man is left to himself; his initiative is 
carried to a maximum and that of the state to a minimum. By collectivism 
a man's least actions are directed by the state . . . the individual possesses 
no initiative; all the acts of his life are mapped out." Le Bon had no 
difficulty determining which of these two conflicting principles leads to 
greater results. "The peoples among whom individualism is most highly 
developed are by this fact alone at the head of civilization," he said, "and 
today dominate the world." 
 <p>
Socialism has no appeal for a vigorous, self-confident people. It begins to 
gain ground, however, when the middle and upper classes lose their 
moorings, when they are "no longer sure of their rights. Or rather, they 
are not sure of anything, and they do not know how to defend anything." <p>
Once they succumb to what Le Bon called a "vague humanitarianism," 
their days as free men are numbered. "Under the unconscious but 
disintegrating influence of this humanitarianism, the directing classes 
[lose] all confidence in the justice of their cause. They surrender more 
and more to the leaders of the opposing party, who merely despise them 
in proportion to their concessions." 
 <p>
To avert the triumph of socialism, Le Bon counseled his countrymen to 
"give up our perpetual prospects of reform, and also the idea that we must 
always be changing our constitutions, our institutions, and our laws. 
Above all we ought to limit, and not constantly extend, the intervention 
of the state, so as to force the citizens to acquire a little of the initiative 
and the habit of self-government" of which they have been deprived by 
pandering and paternalistic programs.

Duplantier</a> <br>December 7, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Political Chaos and the Decay of Language</h2></center><P> 
[British writer George Orwell is best remembered for the novels 1984 and 
Animal Farm, two of the most prophetic satires about 20th Century 
socialism ever written. But Orwell was also a prolific journalist and 
essayist. A short piece he wrote entitled "Politics and the English 
Language" should be required reading for anyone who wants to explore 
the connection between degraded language and political tyranny.] 
 <p>
The quality of our language and the quality of our thought are 
inextricably linked. Our language "becomes ugly and inaccurate because 
our thoughts are foolish," said George Orwell, "but the slovenliness of 
our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts." Orwell was 
convinced that we could improve the quality of our language and the 
quality of our thought if we would just pay more attention to what we say 
and write. "Modern English," he said, "is full of bad habits which spread 
by imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the 
necessary trouble. If one gets rid of these habits, one can think more 
clearly, and to think more clearly is a necessary first step toward political 
regeneration." 
 <p>
Among the bad linguistic habits Orwell identified are worn-out 
metaphors, pretentious diction, and meaningless words. Many metaphors 
"have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save 
people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves." Who today can 
even recall what it originally meant to "toe the line" or "ride roughshod 
over"?  Pretentious diction, particularly the use of polysyllabic words of 
foreign derivation, is a nasty habit favored by "scientific, political and 
sociological writers" who are "haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek 
words are grander than Saxon ones." The worst habit of all is to use 
language, our tool of communication, in such a way as to communicate 
nothing.  "In certain kinds of writing, " said Orwell, "particularly in art 
criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages 
which are almost completely lacking in meaning." 
 <p>
Orwell observed that "modern writing at its worst does not consist in 
picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in 
order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long 
strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else. <p> 
"This allows us to avoid the difficult task of thinking.  If we get out of the 
habit of thinking, however, we become susceptible to all sorts of 
foolishness. 
 <p>
Political writing nowadays is invariably "bad writing," said Orwell, 
because it is used primarily for the "defense of the indefensible." 
Euphemism, evasion, and vagueness are its main characteristics. Every 
conscientious citizen must be in the habit of thinking, and pay close 
attention, if he is to avoid being victimized by the obfuscations of 
demagogues. Orwell encouraged all true patriots to "recognize that the 
present political chaos is connected with the decay of language."  He 
urged us to defend our liberties by defending our language.

Duplantier</a> <br>December 8, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Communists Still A Threat</h2></center><P> 
[Dramatic reforms in the once-captive nations of Eastern Europe and the 
Soviet Union signaled the end of the Cold War and ushered in an era of 
peace, right?  Not necessarily.  One former KGB agent says the whole 
thing's a charade -- part of a long-range Soviet strategy to conquer the 
West without firing a shot!]
<p>
Anatoliy Golitsyn was a KGB agent for 16 years prior to his defection to  
the United States in 1961. In 1984 he published a book called New Lies  
for Old in which he predicted unprecedented economic and political  
reforms behind the Iron Curtain. the legalization of Solidarity in Poland.  
and the fall of the Berlin Wall. His predictions were ignored or dismissed  
at the time, but all soon came to pass. Westerners were astounded by the  
turn of events, and in the euphoria that followed the significance of  
Golitsyn's predictions was lost. 
 <p>
But Golitsyn is sounding the alarm again. He's just published a new book  
called The Perestroika Deception in which he repeats the warnings he  
issued more than 10 years ago. Golitsyn says the purpose of perestroika is  
twofold: to elicit Western financial support for the revitalization of the  
socialist economies, and to facilitate the convergence of East and West.  <p>
The ultimate aim is "peaceful conquest of the United States and Western  
Europe from within." 
 <p>
The Communists have gone to great lengths to recreate the trappings of  
Western democracy, with opposition parties and free elections. But they  
are just imitations of the real thing. "Even so-called 'free' elections do not  
pose a problem for the Communist parties. Because of their secret  
partnership with the 'opposition.' the Communist Parties are invariably in  
a winning position. It is their candidates -- whether Communist or 'non- 
Communist' -- who always win, since all the non-Communist candidates  
and 'parties' are controlled," says Golitsyn. "The Communists have  
succeeded in concealing from the West that the 'non-Communist' parties  
are secret partners of the Communists, not alternatives or rivals to them." 
 <p>
The same thing goes for the so-called independent Republics. "The  
present Communist strategists are concealing that it is they who are now  
creating 'independent' Republics." says Golitsyn. "The strategists are  
concealing the secret coordination that exists, and will continue to exist,  
between Moscow and the 'nationalist' leaders of these newly 'independent'  
Republics." He says the apparently fragmented Soviet Empire can be  
reassembled at any time. 
 
Perestroika represents "a broad strategic assault on the Western mindset,"  
an assault that gives every indication of achieving spectacular success.  <p>
"The meaning of developments in the (formerly) Communist world is  
misunderstood," says Golitsyn, "and the intentions behind Communist  
initiatives have been misinterpreted. Enemies are accepted and treated as  
though they have suddenly overnight. become allies of the West."  
Golitsyn confesses himself saddened by "the contemporary jubilation of  
American and West European conservatives who are cheering  
'perestroika' without realizing that it is intended to bring about their own  
political and even physical demise."

<h2>Real Men</h2></center><P> 
[Remember the good old days when men were the towers of strength and 
faithfulness we expected them to be?]
<P>
Tens of thousands of American males are trying to rediscover what it 
really means to be a man, and thousands of American women are rooting 
for them. Syndicated columnist Armstrong Williams reports that a group 
called Promise Keepers is "attracting men of all backgrounds to publicly 
declare their faith in God and acceptance of responsibility for leadership 
in their families and communities." Promise Keepers have filled football 
stadiums to demonstrate their determination to keep their marriage 
promises. What's behind it? Why is it happening now? Williams believes 
that, after three decades of experimentation it's become indisputably 
clear that the deconstruction of traditional gender roles by the feminist 
and the playboy movements has failed.
<P>
"After more than a quarter-century that saw the rise of feminism, gay 
rights, and societal approval of a variety of so-called 'alternative 
lifestyles,' we have come almost full circle," says Williams. "The results 
of our cultural experimentation -- high divorce and illegitimacy rates, 
rising crime and violence -- have forced us to take a second look. 
Perhaps the traditional male role as a leader of the family and 
community, should be restored."
<P>
There's little doubt about that, of course. The big question is, How many 
young American males can even remember what it means to be a real 
man? Not many, concludes Williams, who offers a refresher course. 
Being a real man means respecting "the institution of marriage" and 
being responsible for the children that you bring into the world. It means 
scrupulosity in word and deed. "A real man has no need for profanity 
[and] does not engage in public disorderliness or drunkenness. A real 
man accepts responsibility for his actions; he does not make excuses for 
his mistakes or failures. He learns from them and improves himself to 
ensure that they do not happen again."
<P>
A real man is always conscious of the impression he makes, knowing 
that he is "an example and role model for his own children and the 
children in his neighborhood." He is honest, bold, and resolute. "That 
means making a decision consistent with your principles and sticking to 
it," says Williams. "A real man knows that showing love is not a 
weakness, but a strength." He understands the difference between men 
and women, accepts it, celebrates it. At the risk of being denounced for 
his gallantry, he holds doors open for women and gives up his seat on 
the bus for them.
<P>
A man must have "integrity," says Armstrong Williams, and that means 
"holding on to your principles regardless of the circumstances." A lot of 
men need these lessons in manhood, Armstrong says, because Americans 
"have forgotten where we came from and so we don't know where we're 
going. Only by remembering how things once were will we be able to 
begin working to restore civility and virtue to our chaotic society." Three 
cheers for the Promise Keepers!
<p>                           <P>

<h2>Global Taxes</h2></center><P> 

[The fat cats at the United Nations are tired of having to rely on the 
generosity of member countries. They now want to bypass these 
sovereign governments and tax the people of the world directly!]
<P>
The calls for a global tax to finance the operations of the United Nations 
seem to be coming from all quarters. The so-called Independent 
Commission on Population and Quality of Life argues that the United 
Nations should be able to tax aviation traffic and freight, aviation fuel, 
ocean freight and cruises, telecommunications frequencies, 
communications satellites, international postal items, and trade in goods 
and services. At the UN World Summit for Social Development, held in 
Copenhagen earlier this year, Clinton appointee James Speth, head of 
the UN Development Program, proposed a global tax on speculative 
movements of international funds, the consumption of non-renewable 
energy, environmental permits, and the arms trade. The Clinton 
Administration is pushing for ratification of the UN Convention on the 
Law of the Sea, which would set up an International Seabed Authority to 
collect fees and royalties imposed on American mining firms.
<P>
James Tobin, 1981 Nobel Prize winner in Economics, has called for a 
tax on spot transactions in foreign exchange. Tobin predicts that "the 
revenue potential is immense, over $1.5 trillion a year." Needless to say, 
UN bureaucrats are enthusiastic about the possibilities of this new 
"Tobin tax."
<P>
The Commission on Global Governance argues that "it is time for a 
consensus on global taxation for servicing the needs of the global 
neighborhood." The Commission, which is supported by government and 
foundation funding, calls for taxes on flight-lanes, sea lanes, and ocean 
fishing areas. The Commission claims that "the idea of safeguarding and 
managing the global commons, particularly those related to the physical 
environment, is now widely accepted."
<P>
The Worldwatch Institute calls for a global tax to finance "the transition 
to a sustainable society -- including environmental programs, social 
initiatives, and peacekeeping efforts." The Oxfam Poverty Report 
proclaims that "international aid should be seen as a financial 
entitlement, and as part of a compact between citizens in the industrial 
and developing worlds." The Ford Foundation wants the UN to have 
Special Drawing Rights from the International Monetary Fund. This 
"levy on the utilization of the global commons" would allow the UN to 
put the squeeze on American taxpayers without going through our 
Congress. The World Federalist Association, headed by former 
presidential candidate John Anderson, recommends UN taxes on 
international travel and postal service.
<P>
The United Nations has no right or authority whatsoever to tax people, 
businesses, or transactions, but that won't stop the UN's greedy 
international bureaucrats from trying to usurp such authority. Too much 
of our country's wealth has already been squandered on this subversive 
organization with the cooperation of American leaders. Imagine how the 
UN will bleed us dry when it has its own taxing power and no longer 
needs to ask for our cooperation!
<p>                           <P>

<h2>Bilingual Ed.</h2></center><P> 
[Bilingual education is a bureaucratic boondoggle that is isolating 
immigrant children from the rest of American society and relegating 
them to a life of second-class citizenship.]
<P>
Federal bureaucrats forced bilingual education programs into the public 
schools in 1974 without any research whatsoever to demonstrate their 
effectiveness. Twenty years later, there's still no proof that these 
programs bring immigrant children into the English-speaking 
mainstream of our nation. Prior to 1974, millions of immigrants learned 
English by the immersion method. That means that immigrant children 
went to public schools where only English was spoken and learned this 
new language rapidly. They then went home and taught English to their 
parents.
<P>
Since 1974, federal regulations have required that public school 
instructors be proficient in the foreign language they teach, but do not 
require that they speak English fluently. A school can lose its federal 
funding if it fails to "instruct," "maintain," and "develop" in the student's 
native tongue, but there is no corresponding penalty for failing to teach 
English. Unfortunately, foreign language instructors have discovered 
that they can enhance their job security by delaying their students' 
transition to English. As a result, many of their students graduate from 
public high schools without ever learning English. 
<P>
Representative Toby Roth of Wisconsin has introduced a bill in Congress 
mandating that all federal government business be conducted in English 
and repealing statutes that require non-English ballots and bilingual 
education. "In many places in America, English is no longer the first 
language in school," says Roth. "Our children are now taught, by law 
and with government funds, in dozens of languages other than English -- 
12 different languages in New York City alone. Instead of a first-rate 
education in English. students in bilingual education classes are taught 
in their native tongue, and English is rarely spoken."
<P>
Toby Roth argues that, despite the enormous expense involved (an 
estimated $8 billion annually), "bilingual education is a dismal failure at 
doing what Congress originally asked it to do: teach children English 
quickly and effectively. Tragically, it relegates countless children -- 
unable to speak, understand, and use English effectively -- to a second-
class future. More important, programs like bilingual education divide 
our country by undermining the common bond that holds our country 
together -- our English language."
<P>
Congressman Roth says that the purpose of his legislation is simply to 
ensure that "the primary language of instruction in schools is English, 
and that [Americans] vote and deal with the government in English. 
People will still be able, even encouraged, to speak and learn a foreign 
language, and preserve their heritage," he insists. "The only significant 
difference will be that government actively reinforces our common 
language rather than erodes it."
<P>
Congressman Roth says that his overriding goal is "to keep America one 
nation, one people. We must preserve the common bond that has kept 
this country of immigrants together for more than two centuries by 
making English our official language. Our future as a united nation 
depends on it."

<h2>Truth in Learning</h2></center><P>                

[The failure of our educational system -- especially our colleges and 
universities -- can be traced, ultimately, to one human flaw, arrogance.]
<P>
The tremendous popularity of the television quiz show called Wheel of 
Fortune no doubt derives from the program's ingenious design, which 
encourages contestants to delay solution of the puzzle while racking up 
points for guessing the letters that compose it. Home viewers are thereby 
assured of knowing the answer long before it is officially acknowledged. 
What keeps Wheel of Fortune fans coming back is the pleasant feeling of 
superiority home viewers enjoy each time the answer is revealed, and 
they find out it's just what they thought it was.
<P>
A similar predictability may have accounted for the tremendous 
popularity of one of the best-selling books of the 1980s, Allan Bloom's 
“The Closing of the American Mind.” That's the book that started an 
impressive genre of writing critical of colleges and universities. After all, 
Allan Bloom didn't really tell us anything we didn't already know. We'd 
known for years that the colleges are filled with leftist and relativistic 
ideologues. We didn't need to spend $20 on a 400-page book to find that 
out, but many of us did, and were gratified that a university professor 
had finally said what we'd been saying all along.
<P>
A lesser-known scholar named James Schall also set out to expose the 
intellectual blight in our nation's universities. His book, entitled 
“Another Sort of Learning,” appeared almost simultaneously with the 
paperback  release of “The Closing of the American Mind,” but it did not 
enjoy similar success. Here's why: Rather than make us feel superior, 
even a bit smug, by confirming our bleak assessments of contemporary 
education, Schall's book made us feel uneasy. Schall insisted, for 
instance, that "most of the important things we do not in fact learn are 
not learned because we choose not to learn them." In other words, we 
expect too much from the universities, and we've only got ourselves to 
blame for our manifest deficiencies.
<P>
Schall went even further. He suggested that a university is "not really 
equipped" to provide the education we need. He said that the university 
is "designed, consciously or unconsciously, to prevent us from 
confronting in our own lives the ultimate questions of existence and 
essence." Needless to say, Schall's radical ideas didn't go over big in 
college towns. After all, it's one thing to say that the system isn't 
working: it's another thing entirely to say it isn't meant to work. But 
that's what Schall said, emphasizing that "we meet the more ultimate 
things in our churches, in our families, in our living, in our friendships."
<P>
Schall wasn't satisfied with condemning relativism. He had to talk about 
Truth. Allan Bloom had discussed Truth too, but somehow, in Schall's 
book, Truth seemed to mean something specific. Unlike Bloom, Schall 
dared to identify the source of Truth, and to declare that revelation 
makes it available to everyone, the humbler the better. James Schall's 
book, “Another Sort of Learning,” addresses the first causes of the 
decline of college campuses today.

<h2>Pugwash Brainwash</h2></center><P> 

[This year's Nobel Peace Prize speaks volumes about the dubious politics 
of the Nobel Committee.]
<P>
This year's Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the Pugwash Conferences 
on Science and World Affairs, a long-inactive organization, and to one 
of its last remaining members, 86-year-old Polish-born Joseph Rotblat. 
Few Americans under the age of 50 even remember the Pugwash 
Conferences or have any idea who Joseph Rotblat is. They're not likely to 
understand the significance of this year's Peace Prize, or to realize what 
a travesty it is.
<P>
The Pugwash Conferences took their name from the location of the first 
conference, held in 1957 in Pugwash, Nova Scotia, the home of the 
organization's chief financial backer, multi-millionaire U.S. industrialist 
Cyrus Eaton. Eaton and other Pugwash members, such as British 
philosopher Bertrand Russell, were ardent socialists who sought, under 
the guise of scientific objectivity, to influence world affairs to the 
advantage of the Soviet Union and to the detriment of the United States.
<P>
The most important Pugwash Conference took place in Moscow in 1960. 
Among the more prominent U.S. scientists attending were Jerome 
Wiesner and Walt Rostow, who shortly after their return became leading 
policy planners in the next administration of President John F. Kennedy. 
At that Moscow conference, Wiesner outlined a comprehensive program 
for nuclear disarmament and for transferring our nation's military 
strength to an international agency. Rostow also addressed the 
conference, recommending a nuclear test ban treaty .
<P>
Rostow was well placed in the Kennedy Administration to promote this 
objective. In 1963, President Kennedy sent Averell Harriman to Moscow 
to sign the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, thereby perpetuating the 
tremendous advantage that the Soviets had gained from a recent series of 
giant nuclear tests. Rostow and his fellow Pugwash members were 
criticized for jeopardizing U.S. security with this treaty, but they 
continued to insist that "nuclear parity will promote peace." They 
argued, absurdly, that abandoning America's nuclear advantage in favor 
of equality between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. would make the Soviet 
Union feel more secure and thereby less likely to resort to war!
<P>
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, who served in both the Kennedy 
and the Johnson Administrations, made "parity" a cornerstone of his 
strategy to abandon our strategic superiority. He argued that "nuclear 
parity" would give the world "a more stable balance of terror." It had, in 
fact, the very opposite effect, emboldening the Soviet Union to extend its 
evil empire, secure in the knowledge that the United States could no 
longer risk a nuclear showdown. The Soviets maintained their aggressive 
military posture until President Reagan rebuilt our military strength and 
demonstrated his determination to follow through on building the 
Strategic Defense Initiative. Unable to keep pace with our procurement, 
the evil empire self-destructed. In awarding this year's Peace Prize to the 
Pugwash Conferences, the Nobel Committee makes abundantly clear that 
its idea of "peace" is really pacifism.

<h2>Medical Savings Accounts</h2></center><P> 

[The most important section of the Republicans' Medicare reform bill is 
Medical Savings Accounts.]
<P>
It is the inclusion of Medical Savings Accounts (known as MSAs) that 
makes the Republican Medicare bill a genuine, free-market-oriented 
reform. Without them, according to Peter Ferrara of Americans for Tax 
Reform, the Medicare plan could not be supported "by anyone who 
opposed the Clinton health plan last year." Ferrara argues that MSAs 
will allow "market incentives and competition [to] control costs 
consistent with patient preferences." Without MSAs, "the Medicare 
reform would only meet the budget targets through the same heavy-
handed rationing mechanisms included in the Clinton plan last year."
<P>
All fall, there has been tremendous pressure from the media and the 
liberal establishment to drop MSAs from the Medicare package, but that 
would be a tremendous mistake and jeopardize the future of Americans 
in their golden years. According to policy analyst Peter Ferrara, 
"reimbursements to doctors and hospitals would be cut so much that 
many would refuse to treat Medicare patients. In particular, the elderly 
would no longer have access to the latest, most advanced, most 
sophisticated care. They would suffer with essentially the same low-
quality care as imposed on Medicaid patients today." Or they would be 
shunted off into health maintenance organizations, "where they would 
have to give up control over their health care to a third-party 
bureaucracy."
<P>
Who gets control -- "each individual patient, or the government and its 
designated rationing bodies" -- is the central issue in health care reform. 
"MSAs give power to the people. Without MSAs, the Medicare reform 
plan would only take control over their health care away from retirees."
<P>
According to Ferrara, Medical Savings Accounts "provide complete 
catastrophic coverage for all expenses over the deductible in the plan. 
Medicare does not provide such coverage." MSAs put a reasonable cap 
on "out-of-pocket expenses for the elderly." Medicare, by contrast, “has 
no cap on out-of-pocket expenses. Retirees can be liable for tens of 
thousands in expenses each year under the program,” says Ferrara. "That 
is why 70 percent of the elderly buy private supplemental insurance to 
cover those gaps." MSAs can be used to "pay for health expenses not 
covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs." MSAs also "allow 
broader freedom of choice of doctors and services than Medicare." As it 
stands now, many doctors refuse to treat Medicare patients because 
Medicare "underpays health providers so substantially." Ferrara says 
"that problem will only get worse in the future."
<P>
Widespread use of Medical Savings Accounts would reduce health care 
spending dramatically. Health care costs would be reduced by as much as 
30 percent if all Americans switched from traditional third-party 
insurance to Medical Savings Accounts. Those opposed to MSAs use 
false budget estimates, claiming that MSAs would increase Medicare 
spending. But Peter Ferrara insists that "MSAs do not increase out-of-
pocket costs for the sick. They reduce them," and, in fact, are better than 
what Medicare gives seniors now.

<h2>Aristotle on Democracy</h2></center><P> 

[The Greek philosopher Aristotle analyzed the benefits and 
disadvantages of various forms of government. His comments on the 
nature of democracies are especially valuable to Americans.]
<P>
Aristotle believed that communities are established when men are 
"drawn together by a common interest," each attaining "a share in good 
life." This good life is "the chief end, both for the community as a whole 
and for each of us individually." Aristotle argued that monarchies, 
aristocracies, and democracies can all be acceptable to the citizens of a 
country if their constitutions are just: "Those constitutions which 
consider the common interest are right constitutions," said Aristotle. 
"Those constitutions which consider only the personal interest of the 
rulers are all wrong constitutions, or perversions of the right forms."
<P>
Justice demands that a nation's rulers -- whatever their number -- be 
bound by law. Men have a right to expect impartiality when they sue for 
justice. For this they need "a neutral authority; and law is a neutral 
authority." The sovereignty of the law must supersede the sovereignty of 
the ruler. The law is a higher authority than the ruler because it proceeds 
from a higher authority. "He who commands that law should rule 
[commands] that God and reason alone should rule," said Aristotle: "he 
who commands that a man should rule adds the character of the beast."
<P>
Democracies inevitably decline when they cease to respect this higher 
authority and place the interests of any one group above the common 
good. In so doing, they ultimately destroy their middle classes. Without 
those middle classes, or "golden mean." democracies are left with 
"people who are ignorant how to rule and only know how to obey, as if 
they were so many slaves, and, on the other hand, people who are 
ignorant how to obey any sort of authority and only know how to rule as 
if they were masters of slaves." Clashes between the envious and the 
contemptuous will soon level such a state. "Nothing could be further 
removed from the spirit of friendship or the temper of a political 
community," warned Aristotle. "Community depends upon friendship."
<P>
The continued existence of a substantial middle class in America is vital 
to the preservation of our form of government. Every assault upon the 
middle class threatens to undermine the integrity of that government. 
The most obvious assault upon the middle class is our confiscatory 
income tax. The progressive income tax was one of Karl Marx's goals, 
and he supported it specifically to impoverish the middle class, thereby 
polarizing society and promoting class warfare. If we are to retain our 
freedom, we must protect this beleaguered middle class from further 
encroachment. Efforts to restore our constitutional government would be 
greatly facilitated by a swelling of the middle class. We are indebted to 
Aristotle for his exposition of the crucial role that the middle class plays 
in safeguarding freedom and a just society.

<h2>Pursuit of Happiness</h2></center><P> 

[Along with our lives, the promise of salvation and the means through 
Christ are undoubtedly the greatest gifts ever bestowed on mankind.]
<P>
Inspiration and a close examination of God's plan in nature enabled pre-
Christian Greek and Roman philosophers to formulate reasonably 
effective systems for right living and right government. Yet God himself, 
the acknowledged source of all true law, saw fit to promulgate His codes 
more directly. First He gave us His Ten Commandments through Moses, 
and then He sent His only Son to reaffirm those commandments and to 
offer us two central laws under which those commandments were 
subsumed: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and 
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great 
commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy 
neighbor as thyself."
<P>
In His Sermon on the Mount, Christ made clear that we must obey the 
spirit of God's law and not merely the letter. Surely this is a fantastic 
vision of utopia a world in which men love their enemies and forgive 
them every trespass: in which they do not swear, do not look on women 
lustfully, and do not seek revenge; do their alms and praying privately; 
and take no thought of their own lives of tomorrow. "Be ye therefore 
perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." Christ 
commanded the multitudes.
<P>
Christ knew that His listeners could not live up to these exacting 
standards without divine assistance, but He presented them as an ideal, 
something to strive for, and He offered us another gift, His grace, by 
which we might truly have hope of attaining perfection. This vision of 
utopia is at once the most unrealistic ever presented to man and at the 
same time the only one that we can really, with God's grace, hope to 
enjoy. It is everything that this world is not, and we must renounce the 
things of this world if we are to share in that one.
<P>
More than 400 years after the birth of Christ, the great Christian 
theologian Augustine gave to the temporal approximation of this utopia 
the name "The City of God" and juxtaposed it to the earthly city: "The 
one consists of those who wish to live after the flesh, the other of those 
who wish to live after the spirit." According to Augustine, the earthly 
city has been formed by "the love of self, even to the contempt of God: 
the heavenly city by the love of God, even to the contempt of self." The 
end of the heavenly city is "peace in eternal life," whereas "the earthly 
city, which does not live by faith, seeks an earthly peace."
<P>
In the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas adapted Aristotle's philosophy to 
the formulation of his own “Summa Theologica.” Like Aristotle, 
Aquinas maintained that the end of man is happiness, but he insisted 
that this happiness is an eternal one that we cannot obtain in this world.

<h2>Founding Fathers</h2></center><P> 
[The Declaration of Independence and our U.S. Constitution incorporate 
the wisdom of the ages. They are a gift to us from our Founding 
Fathers.]
<P>
The Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas affirmed the right of subjects 
to depose a king "if, becoming a tyrant, he abuses the royal power." In 
this he anticipated the thinking of the 17th century English philosopher 
John Locke and of the American patriots who declared their 
independence from the British crown in 1776.
<P>
According to John Locke's “Second Treatise of Civil Government,” the 
authority of political power derives from a social contract agreed to 
voluntarily by free, equal, and independent men. That power loses its 
authority when, by violating this contract, it loses the consent of the 
parties thereto. Locke conceded that the people are generally reluctant to 
exercise this power to dissolve ineffective or oppressive governments: 
"Great mistakes in the ruling part, many wrong and inconvenient laws, 
and all the slips of human frailty will be borne by the people without 
mutiny or murmur. But if a long train of abuses, prevarications, and 
artifices, all tending the same way, make the design visible to the people, 
and they cannot but feel what they lie under and see whither they are 
going, it is not to be wondered that they should then rouse themselves 
and endeavor to put the rule into such hands which may secure to them 
the ends for which government was at first erected."
<P>
Locke went to great lengths to distinguish liberty from license and to 
demonstrate that law is the liberator, not the oppressor of man. "Law, in 
its true notion, is not so much the limitation as the direction of a free and 
intelligent agent to his proper interest, and prescribes no farther than is 
for the general good of those under that law," said Locke. He argued that 
"the end of law is not to abolish or restrain but to preserve and enlarge 
freedom," emphasizing that freedom is not, however, "a liberty for every 
man to do what he [pleases]."
<P>
The Declaration of Independence enumerated the abuses of royal power 
that the founding fathers considered sufficient to justify their 
renunciation of the king's sovereignty. There, and in the Preamble to the 
Constitution of the United States, they spelled out the principles that 
formed the foundation of their  vision of a better world. Echoes of 
Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and John Locke can be 
heard in both documents. The Constitution with its Bill of Rights 
incorporates the wisdom of the ages. By protecting our God-given rights 
from the encroachment of government we expand our freedom to pursue 
true happiness.
<P>
In this season of gift-giving, let us be grateful not only for the gifts that 
God has given us directly but also for those that have come to us through 
the wisdom of our Founding Fathers. Let us pass these gifts on to our 
descendants in the hope that they too will share our vision of a better 
world.

[Everyone loves the Clement Moore classic "A Visit from St. Nick." 
Here's a revised version of that yuletide favorite that recaptures the true 
meaning of Christmas.]
<p>
Twas the morning of Christmas, when all through the house/All the 
family was frantic, including my spouse;/For each one of them had one 
thing only in mind,/To examine the presents St. Nick left behind./The 
boxes and wrapping and ribbons and toys/Were strewn on the floor, and 
the volume of noise/Increased as our children began a big fight/Over who 
got the video games, who got the bike./I looked at my watch and I said, 
slightly nervous,/"Let's get ready for church, so we won't miss the 
service."/The children protested "We don't want to pray:/We just got our 
presents, and we want to play!"
<p>
It dawned on me then that we had gone astray,/In confusing the purpose 
of this special day;/Our presents were many and very high-priced/But 
something was missing -- that something was Christ!/I said, "Put the gifts 
down and let's gather together,/And I'll tell you a tale of the greatest gift 
ever:/A Savior was promised when Adam first sinned,/And the hopes of 
the world upon Jesus were pinned./Abraham begat Isaac, who Jacob 
begat,/And through David the line went to Joseph, whereat/This carpenter 
married a maiden with child,/Who yet was a virgin, in no way defiled./ 
Saying 'Hail, full of Grace,' an archangel appeared/To Mary the Blessed, 
among women revered:/The Lord willed she would bear -- through the 
Spirit -- a Son./Said Mary to Gabriel, 'God's will be done.'
<p>
"Now Caesar commanded a tax would be paid,/And all would go home 
while the census was made;/Thus Joseph and Mary did leave Galilee/For 
the city of David to pay this new fee./Mary's time had arrived, but the inn 
had no room,/So she laid in a manger the fruit of her womb;/And both 
Joseph and Mary admired as He napped/The Light of the World in his 
swaddling clothes wrapped./Three wise men from the East had come 
looking for news/Of the birth of the Savior, the King of the Jews;/They 
carried great gifts as they followed a star --/Gold, frankincense, myrrh, 
which they'd brought from afar.
<p>
"As the shepherds watched over their flocks on that night,/The glory of 
God shone upon them quite bright,/And an angel explained the intent of 
the birth,/Saying, 'Glory to God and His peace to the earth.'/For this was 
the Messiah whom prophets foretold,/A good Shepherd to bring His 
sheep back to the fold;/He was God become man, He would die on the 
cross,/He would rise from the dead to restore Adam's loss.
<p>
"Santa Claus, Christmas presents, a brightly lit pine,/Candy canes and 
spiced eggnog are all very fine;/Let's have fun celebrating, but leave not a 
doubt/That Christ is what Christmas is really about!"/The children right 
then put an end to the noise,/They dressed quickly for church, put aside 
all their toys;/For they knew Jesus loved them and said they were 
glad/That He'd died for their sins, and to save their dear Dad.
<p>                           <P>

<h2>Secular Humanism</h2></center><P>

[Paul Kurtz, president and editor-in-chief of Prometheus Books, 
explained once in an Associated Press interview exactly what it is that he 
and other "secular humanists" actually believe.]
<p>
"Secular humanists are committed to the use of reason and science to 
understand the world," said Paul Kurtz. "We also believe it's necessary to 
develop a new morality appropriate to the present needs. I believe in the 
use of reason to build a good life on this planet without the illusion of 
salvation or immortality." That good life and that new morality are the 
subjects of a number of written works bearing the emblem of Kurtz's 
publishing house, Prometheus Books. Here-are some of the titles: 
Atheism: The Case Against God,  Beneficent Euthanasia, The 
Encyclopedia of Unbelief, The New Sexual Revolution, Ethics Without 
God, and Religion Without God.
<p>
In an essay entitled "Humanism and the Moral Revolution," Kurtz 
contends that traditional morality has been made obsolete by "an 
explosive technology that has rapidly transformed our culture. A sharp 
disparity has emerged between the new technology and our inherited 
moral codes." Kurtz believes that "the good life is achieved when we 
realize the human potential. This means that we ought to reject all those 
creeds and dogmas that impede human fulfillment or impose external 
authoritarian rules upon human beings. The traditional supernaturalistic 
moral commandments are especially repressive of our human needs," 
says Kurtz. "They are immoral insofar as they foster illusions about 
human destiny and suppress vital inclinations."
<p>
In another essay, Kurtz confides that Humanism "is related to a doctrine 
of liberation and emancipation. It values the autonomy of free agents, not 
only in their intellectual beliefs but in their aesthetic experience, their 
romantic or sexual proclivities, their moral tastes and values." No subject 
is taboo to free-thinking secular humanists -- no subject, that is, except 
one: belief in God. The faithful will be outcast in the coming new order, 
and the measure of the "freedom" of what passes for thought will be the 
fervency of one's nonbelief. "Humanism cannot in any fair sense of the 
word apply to one who still believes in God as the source and creator of 
the universe," Kurtz comments.
<p>
Will free-thinking secular humanists suffer the faithful to exist as 
harmless anomalies and quaint anachronisms? No, our faith is a constant 
challenge to their infidelity; it makes them feel bad. Humanists cannot be 
truly free until all belief and all believers are exterminated. "For 
Humanism has always been opposed to any and all forms of tyranny over 
the mind of man," proclaims Kurtz. "This puts Humanism squarely in 
opposition to all authoritarian, religious or totalitarian ideologies that 
attempt to suppress, limit or censor human intelligence or to impose an 
orthodoxy of belief or morality." It's an unpleasant fact, but secular 
humanism and faith in God cannot coexist. One of the two must 
ultimately triumph. Rest assured that humanists, if they ever have the 
power, will not tolerate us as we have tolerated them.

<h2>Bosnia</h2></center><P>

[The war in Bosnia is a European affair, and European nations should 
settle it. The United States has no strategic interests in Bosnia and gains 
nothing by getting involved.]
<p>
In a historic address to the U.S. Congress, the President acknowledged 
that the interests of European nations are of no particular significance to 
the United States. These nations get embroiled in "frequent controversies, 
the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns," said the 
President, concluding that it would be "unwise" to get involved in matters 
of purely European concern. The geographic isolation of the United 
States is a tremendous strategic advantage, and Americans should make 
full use of it. The President said it would be foolish to jeopardize the 
peace and prosperity of our country by thrusting ourselves into the 
middle of the age-old ethnic and national rivalries of Europe.
<p>
These, alas, are not the sentiments of President Bill Clinton. They were 
expressed by an American president, however -- our very first president, 
in fact. President George Washington made his remarks 900 years ago in 
the Farewell Address that culminated his two terms in office. With those 
parting words, Washington advised his countrymen to protect our Union 
against the internal threat of factions and the external threat of foreign 
entanglements. <p>

Like most of our twentieth-century presidents, Bill Clinton is either 
ignorant of, or indifferent to, the warning issued by the Father of our 
Country -- as Clinton's decision to send 20,000 American soldiers into 
Bosnia clearly demonstrates. The President has an obligation to offer the 
American people a persuasive explanation for deployment, but he has yet 
to identify a compelling national interest in Bosnia, and his justifications 
so far seem specious at best. No matter how much the President may 
insist that we do, America does NOT have a moral duty to send troops to 
Bosnia. America does NOT have "values" that must be protected there. 
America does NOT need to go to Bosnia to assert its leadership in the 
world.
<p>
Clinton's status as Commander-in-Chief empowers him to deploy U.S. 
troops in defense of American citizens or interests; it does NOT entitle 
him to send troops anywhere he pleases for whatever reason he chooses. 
Sending U.S. troops to Bosnia will NOT keep the fighting from 
escalating into a wider conflict, it will do just the opposite. Our troops 
will NOT be "peacekeepers," for there is no peace to keep in Bosnia, nor 
has there been for some 500 years. U.S. servicemen should NOT be 
forced to assume the role of international policemen.
<p>
If Europe wants an end to the bloodletting in Bosnia, let European 
nations stop it. They have all the requisite resources. America, in the 
meantime, should concentrate on American interests. We should heed the 
advice that George Washington gave in his famous Farewell Address: 
"The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is, in 
extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political 
connection as possible."
<p>                           <P>

<h2>Illiteracy and Delinquency</h2></center><P> . 

[Everyone's got his own idea of the best way to reduce crime -- more  
policemen, longer sentences, more prisons, and so on. But a number of  
studies suggest that teaching criminals to read may be the best solution of  
all!] 
 <p>
The National Adult Literacy Survey, commissioned by the U.S.  
Department of Education, found in 1993 that nearly half our adult  
population are poor readers. Another U.S. Department of Education  
survey, also in 1993, disclosed that more than two-thirds of U.S.  
schoolchildren cannot read up to their grade level. Al Shanker, longtime  
president of the American Federation of Teachers, declared in 1989 that  
only 3 to 6 percent of 17- and 18-year-olds are able to read editorials and  
articles in major newspapers and write a several-page essay. He said that  
80 percent of public school graduates cannot even write a two-paragraph  
letter to a supermarket manager applying for a job. A study on illiteracy  
commissioned by the Department of Justice in l992 said that 21 million  
Americans can't read at all, 45 million are marginally illiterate, and 20  
percent of high school graduates can't read their diplomas. 
 <p>
A l 993 U.S. Department of Justice study concluded that "the major cause  
of delinquency" is reading failure, and that-children in schools are  
"denied the means to achieve the goal to read." Juvenile delinquents and  
adult prisoners who are taught to read using a traditional intensive  
phonics method show a marked decrease in behavior problems as they  
become literate. 
 <p>
With a research grant funded by the U.S. Department of Justice, Michael  
Brunner spent two years analyzing the literature on illiteracy and  
recidivism. In a new book called Retarding America: The Imprisonment  
of Potential, he comes to the chilling conclusion that reading failure is a  
major cause, rather than just a correlate, of anti-social behavior. Brunner  
found that a high percentage of incarcerated juveniles were diagnosed  
early in school as "learning disabled" even though there was no evidence  
of specific neurological abnormalities. These children never received the  
kind of reading instruction that is successful -- namely, intensive,  
systematic phonics. So they never learned how to identify sounds in  
isolation, to blend individual speech sounds into words, or to segment  
polysyllabic words into speech sounds. Brunner discovered that failure to  
learn to read is a major cause for the frustration and low self-esteem that  
lead to juvenile delinquency. 
 <p>
Brunner reports a poignant interview with an incarcerated teenage boy  
who could decipher only four words and spell two. His years in the public  
school system were a time of constant humiliation because he could not  
read. Combative behavior was the only means he could think of to keep  
his peers from laughing at him. In the correctional institution, the boy  
was taught to read with remedial intensive phonics. Another teenager,  
interviewed at Ironwood Maximum Security Prison, felt like a new  
person once he had mastered phonics and learned to read. It sounds  
incredible, but making sure children learn how to read in the first grade is  
a proven crime prevention technique!

<i>12/28/95</i><hr><h2>Breast Cancer Goose Chase Harms Everyone</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>

</center><hr>

<P> 
Question: How many studies does it take to establish that the cause of 
an illness is not pollution?  Answer: There are never enough when the 
accusers are a combined force of feminists and environmentalists.
<p>
Since the early 1990s, women in the Northeastern U.S., especially Long 
Island, New York, have been claiming that A) they are suffering an 
extraordinary rate of breast cancer, and that B) the cause most 
assuredly lies in the hand of man.  What the specific pollutant is, 
they have been at a loss to say--pesticides in general,  chlorinated 
chemicals, power lines.  The point is that some faceless, nameless 
corporation run by insensitive (no doubt cigar-chomping) white males 
has to be at fault.
<p>
Environmentalists have willingly accommodated them in this belief.  
Not long ago the left-wing magazine Mother Jones featured a cover with 
a woman wearing a gas mask as a brassiere.
<p>
Now there has appeared the latest in a series of studies showing that 
pollution isn't the cause of these higher breast cancer rates.  And 
you know what?  No one seems to care.
<p>
This study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute 
(JNCI), shows that women in the Northeast are indeed more likely to 
die of breast cancer than in other regions of the country.  It also 
found the risk was almost completely due to certain risk factors which 
these women have incurred, including having children later in life and 
greater rates of alcohol use and obesity.
<p>
Other lifestyle factors not looked at could probably explain the rest.
<p>
"This [study] suggests there is nothing uniquely hazardous about 
living in the Northeast," said Joseph K. McLaughlin of the 
International Epidemiology Institute in Rockville, Maryland.
<p>
But the activists don't want to hear this. Cindy Pearson, a 
spokeswoman for the Washington-based National Women's Health Network, 
told the Boston Globe the study "doesn't set my mind at ease, and it 
doesn't make me think there aren't environmental factors at work."
<p>
The federal government's chase after pollutants as a cause of breast 
cancer can be traced back to May 1992, when Long Island women began 
demanding that federal health officials find a bad guy to blame for 
what they perceived as an  extraordinary breast cancer rate in their 
area.  "Women want to know: Why me?  Why now?  Why on Long Island?" 
said one activist.<p>

More telling were the words of Francine Kritchek, co-chair of "One in 
Nine."  "Women are tired of being told that it is because of their 
educational background, their high socio-economic status, their ethnic 
background and their age that they are prone to this illness," she 
said.  In other words, bring me somebody's--ANYBODY'S-- head on a 
platter.
<p>
At the time, four state studies had failed to find connection between 
breast cancer in the state and environmental influences such as 
pesticides.  Nevertheless, with the help of the state's Republican 
U.S. Senator, Al D'Amato, the lobbying has paid off in the form of 
several lavish studies.  The JNCI study was one of them.  And despite 
its negative findings, the NCI is moving forward with a much larger 
one investigating the possible connection between environmental 
factors and breast cancer, the Long Island Breast Cancer Study 
Project. The cost?  An incredible $7 million.
<p>
Yet in 1993 still another study found that the Long Island breast 
cancer rate wasn't extraordinary.  Using a computer database, the Long 
Island-based newspaper Newsday discovered, "The highest breast cancer 
incidence rates were in the San Francisco Bay area, suburban Boston, 
and suburban Chicago, not on Long Island.  Nassau and Suffolk (the 
counties making up Long Island) ranked right in the middle of the 
group studied."
<p>
Did this mollify the Long Island activists?  Far from it. "The fact 
that Long Island isn't alone isn't a comforting thought at all--it's 
an even more disturbing message," one told Newsday.
<p>
Get it? The original problem was that Long Island's breast cancer rate 
was so extraordinarily high. When it turned out it wasn't 
extraordinarily high it was proof of an even greater problem.  Do the 
words "no-win situation" come to mind?
<p>
All of this might be a bit humorous, were in not for a couple of 
considerations. First, this fanatical quest for corporate villains to 
blame is coming at a real human cost. What incentive does a woman have 
to reduce her lifestyle risks if she's convinced that nothing she's 
doing is contributing to her chances of breast cancer?
<p>
Second, these studies are extremely expensive and are a terrific waste 
of time for our nation's top researchers.  In general, breast cancer 
spending--like that of AIDS--is completely disproportionate to its 
incidence.
<p>
Compare breast cancer with prostate cancer. Breast cancer probably 
struck about 183,000 American women in 1995, killing 46,000. Prostate 
cancer probably afflicted about 244,000 men, killing 35,000.  Breast 
cancer survivors may lose one or both breasts, a cruel maiming but one 
fixable through plastic surgery.  More and more often the disease is 
being treated by removal of the tumor only.
<p>
Prostate surgery survivors, conversely, often face permanent impotence 
and incontinence.  But while breast cancer will receive $500 million 
from the feds, prostate cancer will get less than $80 million.  There 
are no studies looking for environmental causes of prostate cancer.
<p>
There are only so many medical researchers and funds to go around.  
It's time we start using our resources based on where they can do the 
most good.  Endless efforts to satisfy paranoid activists don't meet 
that standard.

<P> 


You've probably never heard the term "nocebo" before, but you've 
almost certainly suffered from it.  More than that, the nocebo effect 
is a major player in some of today's biggest health scares.
<P>
A nocebo is a negative placebo. That is, while a placebo pill makes 
you feel better though unbeknownst to you it's only made of sugar,  a 
nocebo makes you feel bad though physiologically speaking it shouldn't 
be able to.
<P>
For example, if someone in your office is suffering from a cold you, 
too, may feel your throat tightening, your bones aching a bit, your 
head hurting perhaps.  Sound familiar? It's happened to all of us.
<P>
When a newspaper at which I worked moved to a new building somebody 
told the librarian that there was formaldehyde in her new library 
bookshelves.  Formaldehyde is a suspected human carcinogen and the 
librarian knew this.  Soon she was suffering from a headache, aching 
joints, and labored breathing--all classic psychosomatic symptoms.
<P>
But then she heard there was no formaldehyde in the shelves. Suddenly 
the symptoms disappeared.  Apparently the final word on the shelves 
was that they did contain formaldehyde but the librarian remained 
blissfully ignorant of this and hence symptom free.
<P>
Nocebos don't get talked about much, which is why the American Health 
Foundation (AHF) recently called together a number of experts for a 
conference on the subject. For nocebos aren't just minor curiosities, 
but are wreaking havoc in America today.
<P>
"We think nocebo has a powerful effect," says AHF President Ernst 
Wynder,  "particularly if the suggestion is made by your doctor and 
then your lawyer and then the newspapers."
<P>
Examples?  Consider Gulf War Syndrome. Tens of thousands of Gulf War 
vets are now claiming that something they were exposed to in the Gulf 
is making them ill. Their list of symptoms totals more than 75, with 
the most common being the classic psychosomatic symptoms such as the 
librarian suffered. Yet study after study, including one just released 
from the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine, have 
showed that Gulf War vets have no more discernible illness than one 
would expect in a group of that size and age category.
<P>
Curiously, virtually none of the sick soldiers complained for the 
first couple of years after the war. Then reservists began to say they 
were sick but the active duty soldiers still had no complaints. That's 
when it hit the newspapers and television, with every news report 
stating emphatically that the syndrome was real. Suddenly the active 
duty soldiers were falling ill, too.
<P>
Yet for the longest time the mysterious ailment remained confined to 
the United States.  Why?  Because other nation's media weren't 
covering the topic.  When the British press started writing about Gulf 
War Syndrome, suddenly British soldiers began falling ill.
<P>
Another example? Try silicone breast implants.
<P>
"For 30 years women were satisfied with implants," Emory University 
gynecology and obstetrics professor Dr. Elizabeth Connell told me.  
Connell headed the FDA panel that investigated the implants.  "Lot of 
studies at the [FDA] hearings and since then showed a very high level 
of pleasure and acceptance and gratitude."
<P>
But then the media and the lawyers got in the act.  Newspapers and 
magazines ran stories with titles like "Ticking Time Bombs,"  "Toxic 
Breasts," and "After Implants, Horror Began."  Suddenly women with 
implants were suffering all sorts of strange illnesses and "realizing" 
that illnesses they already had must be related to their implants.
<P>
"When you have women being told they have ticking timebombs in their 
breasts, what are they to think?" said Connell.
<P>
As with Gulf War Syndrome, the breast implant scare  appears to be 
confined to U.S. shores. Yes, strangely enough, silicone only makes 
American women sick.
<P>
Media reports have also kicked off other famous incidents of hysteria, 
such as a rash of illness at New York's Love Canal after the local 
newspaper informed the citizens they were living on top of a toxic 
waste dump.
<P>
Sometimes there's more to this than blind panic.  There's what 
Columbia University psychologist Dr. Herbert Spiegel, who spoke at the 
AHF conference, calls "secondary gain."
<P>
What this means is that the nocebo effect can be greatly exaggerated 
when the sufferer finds out there's something to be obtained through 
the suffering. Sometimes it's just sympathy. Other times its being 
taken off a job one doesn't like. And sometimes it's big bucks, which 
is where lawyers come in.
<P>
Spiegel is convinced that secondary gain is behind many of the breast 
implant claims, what with some law firms advertising "$100,000 OR MORE 
MAY BE OWED TO YOU!" if you have silicone breast implants.
<P>
"I have no doubt at all that many, " he told me, "of those women . . . 
have an eye on the deep pockets" implant manufacturers.
<P>
Likewise for Gulf War Syndrome, from which many soldiers hope to gain 
lifetime disability pay and others have joined a class action suit 
against numerous chemical companies. "Gulf War Syndrome is a wonderful 
illustration of what I'm talking about," says Dr. Spiegel.
<P>
Can the nocebo effect be cured? Sure. The media, the courts, and the 
general public need to take a healthy dose of skepticism. This won't 
be a popular remedy; it's not as emotionally gratifying as blaming bad 
guys (corporations, government) or as financially rewarding as suing 
them. But then, the best medicine seldom tastes good. It's just good 
for us.

<i>1/17/96</i><hr><h2>Catch Drunks, Don't Harass Drivers</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>
<P> 
On Christmas Eve, 1966, my godfather smashed his car into a tree and 
killed himself.  He was drunk. The best that could be said of his 
sorry exit from this earth was that unlike so many other drunk 
drivers, he didn't take anybody with him.
<P>
You might think this would make me very concerned with drunk driving 
laws and you'd be right. But you'd be wrong if you think it has made 
me an advocate of the continuing trend to reduce allowable levels of 
drivers' blood alcohol content (BAC) from 0.1 percent to 0.08 percent.
<P>
It's not that I wouldn't be in good company.  Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving (MADD) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA) have lobbied vigorously for lowering the limit to .08, while 
the American Medical Association wants it lowered to 0.05 and the 
Department of Health and Human Services wants it knocked down even 
lower to 0.04. But the evidence these good folks cite to support their 
new drinking laws just doesn't wash.
<P>
True, the number of what the NHTSA calls "alcohol-related deaths" has 
shown a steady and significant decline since the early 1980s. During 
that time, a number of states--now totaling 13--have screwed down the 
legal BAC limit from 0.1 to 0.08.
<P>
But does this mean there's a connection? The key word is "deaths." In 
fact, traffic deaths in general have been going down for years as a 
result of safer cars and higher seat belt usage rates. So it only 
makes sense that those from any given cause, including alcohol, would 
be declining.
<P>
A better measure is alcohol-related collisions.  This number has gone 
down just a bit, and it's not at all clear it has to do with those few 
states lowering their BAC limits.
<P>
It's not that drivers don't show signs of impairment at levels below a 
BAC of 0.1.  Indeed, research has shown impairment at levels of 0.04 
or even lower. I drink so little alcohol myself that I could probably 
be impaired driving by a brewery and smelling the smoke stack exhaust.
<P>
Rather, the issue is should we put out a net so wide and so tightly-
woven as to sweep up huge numbers of people or should we concentrate 
on those most likely to create carnage on the streets?
<P>
The net analogy is not a bad one. Even advocates of a 0.08 BAC limit 
admit that drivers below the level of .1 rarely drive erratically, 
hence the only way to catch them will be putting up more police 
roadblocks and doing more random breath testing.  And what will we get 
for these pesky little violations of drivers' privacy?
<P>
Dr. H. Laurence Ross, a professor at the University of New Mexico and 
author most recently of Confronting Drunk Driving, estimates a 
potential increase of 60 percent of DWI offenders (legally-speaking) 
under 0.08 with the possibility of no decrease in fatalities. The 
reason is that the potential of alcohol to impair drivers and cause 
accidents is directly proportionate to the amount consumed.
<P>
According to a recently released study from the Harvard Injury Control 
Center, "Among all male drinking drivers who were killed, 67 percent 
had BACs of 0.15 or above.  Among young adult male drivers (ages 20-
34), 41 percent had BACs of at least 0.20, or twice the legal limit in 
most states."
<P>
Lower BAC advocates note that about 3,000 fatalities each year are 
caused by drivers with BACs of less than 0.1.  But this is misleading. 
The vast majority of fatalities are caused by people with no 
measurable alcohol in their systems at all, yet they still managed to 
kill someone.  For all we know, the drivers who killed those 3,000 
people would have done so just as readily without the aid of liquor. 
<P>
Ironically, one opponent of .08 BAC laws is MADD founder Candy 
Lightner.  In 1992 she wrote, "If we really want to save lives, let's 
go after the most dangerous drivers on the road.  Putting our trust in 
new laws and regulations that attack only the tip of the iceberg will 
not make our highways safer."
<P>
Lightner has been branded a traitor by MADD, especially since two 
years after writing those words she became a lobbyist for the liquor 
industry. Nevertheless knows whereof she speaks.  The man who ran down 
her own 13-year-old daughter in 1980 has been arrested several times 
for drunken driving, each time with a BAC of 0.2 or higher.  And each 
time he gets out of jail and goes at it again.
<P>
Lightner argues that police ought to concentrate their resources on 
arresting drunk drivers, not just drivers who happen to have been 
drinking. When serious offenders are arrested they need to be treated 
seriously, with license revocations and other penalties that increase 
steadily as their number of offenses increases. 
<P>
But to arrest drunk drivers you need police, and suddenly declaring 60 
percent more Americans as criminally inebriated will stretch resources 
thinner than ever.  "Adoption of 0.08 percent BAC has not to date been 
accompanied by any comparable new investments in police resources," 
notes Dr. Ross in a recent issue of Health Drinking magazine, "thus 
diluting an already inadequate control system.  The effect may well be 
to reduce the chances of any impaired drivers being arrested."
<P>
That's something to think about the next time a weaving automobile 
shoots past you and you wonder how come there's never a cop around 
when you need one.

<i>1/25/96</i>
<P>
<h2>GM's Electric Turkey </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
<P>
Imagine a car with a third the cruising range of the cheapest one on 
the market.  Imagine that while the cheapest car takes about three 
minutes to refuel this one takes three to 15 hours, depending on the 
equipment you buy to refuel it.  Imagine that the car will only be 
sold in a few markets in the southwest because it's useless in cold 
temperatures.  Now, if your imagination really stretches, imagine that 
this joke of an automobile costs about $35,000 or four times what the 
cheapest car goes for.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;But this is no imaginary car. It's General Motors' much-celebrated EV1 
electric car, the product of many years of development and one 
extremely large dose of environmental nonsense.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;Resembling a turtle with angular lines, GM's electric Edsel isn't the 
technological marvel it's advertised to be. Indeed, it's all too 
similar to the electric cars that competed with and lost to piston 
engine-powered cars almost 100 years ago.  Moreoever, piston 
technology has improved steadily since then.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;An economy car equipped with such an engine can be propelled an 
amazing 50 miles with a mere gallon of gasoline that weighs only eight 
pounds and costs less than bottled water.  The EV1, in contrast, uses 
low-tech lead acid batteries that in the best of weather propel the 
car only 90 miles with 1175 pounds of batteries, almost half the 
weight of the car itself.  Other types of batteries such as nickel-
metal hydride, nickel cadmium, zinc-air, and lithium would give a much 
longer charge but at even greater expense.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;The lead-acid batteries are not only heavy but huge.  The EV1 has only 
two seats, not because it pretends to be a sports car but rather 
because batteries take up what would be the back seat. Lead-acid 
batteries also last only two to three years and are an environmental 
mess to dispose of in a land fill. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;Not all the criticisms of  electric cars are deserved--just most of 
them.  For example, some on the extreme fringe of the environmental 
movement claim that they shouldn't be labeled zero emission vehicles 
because the power plants that supply the electricity emit pollution 
when they burn coal or oil.  True, but the emissions which electric 
cars produce are generally far outside the city where pollution is a 
problem.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;It's too bad some of the environmental nuts don't understand this, 
because essentially, GM has built a car that only a rich tofu-eating 
environmental looney could be interested in--like, say, actor/activist 
Ed Begley Jr.  Problem is, he already has one.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;That's a huge chunk of the electric car market that's already got one 
in the garage.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;But it's not really GM that built the EV1; rather it's the bureaucrats 
at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) who did.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;In a fit of  both arrogance and technological ignorance, CARB mandated 
back in 1990 that by 1998, two percent of all new cars sold in 
California would have to be zero-emission ones, thus sending the car 
companies scrambling to develop electric vehicles. Ironically, just 
two weeks before the EV1 was announced, CARB backed down  and pushed 
the mandate off into the 21st Century.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;Why GM decided to market the car anyway is anyone's guess, though 
rumors fly (which a GM spokesman denied to me) that the introduction 
was a quid pro quo to get CARB to drop the mandate.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to ignoring technological reality, the CARB mandate also 
ignored how much cleaner cars have already gotten.  Cars built these 
days put out only about four percent of the exhaust of cars produced 
in 1970. That's why the air above every American city has gotten so 
much cleaner since then.  The reason these cars sometimes put out 
large amounts of  pollution is because like anything mechanical, they 
can break and must be repaired.  Also, their owners can tamper with them to improve mileage at the expense of high emissions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;What's needed is a device that can detect defective or tampered-with 
exhaust systems.  It happens that Dr. Donald Stedman and other 
researchers at the University of Denver have invented just such a 
device.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;When placed by the side of the road, it measures how much pollution a 
car puts out as it drives  by. High emissions trigger a video camera 
which films both the car and its license plate. This allows the 
municipality using the device to send a letter (perhaps backed by a 
threat of a fine) to the violator informing him that his car emits too 
much pollution and must be repaired.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;The ability of remote sensing to "read" vehicle exhaust accurately and 
cheaply has been demonstrated repeatedly in the U.S. as well as in 
Canada and Great Britain. Alas, its biggest advantage is its biggest 
drawback.  Because it only singles out gross polluters and leaves most 
of us alone, bureaucrats hate it.  They'd rather foist upon us 
nonsense like the EV1 electric turkey.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;It's possible that electric cars will one day be a viable form of 
transportation for something other than short trips or putting around 
the golf course, but that day is years away.  For now, rather than 
giving in to environmentalist pleas and extortion, the automakers 
should line up behind remote sensing as a way of keeping gasoline cars 
running clean.

<html><head><title>Fumento:  Cancer Charge Against Milk Udderly Ridiculous -- 2/1/96 </title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<i>February 1, 1996</i>
<h2>Cancer Charge Against Milk Udderly Ridiculous</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento </a>

<P>  
Six years ago there was panic in the streets over a chemical sprayed  
on apples called Alar.  Parents threw out their apple sauce and poured  
apple juice down the sinks.  One poor mother went so far as to call  
the state police to have them pull over her child's school bus and  
remove the apple from his lunch pail.  If Dr. Samuel Epstein had his  
way, it would be deja vu all over again, but this time with milk. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr. Epstein, a professor of environmental medicine at the University  
of Illinois School of Public Health in Chicago has created a stir in  
the nation's media, if not yet its grocery stores.  He claims, in the  
January International Journal of Health Services, that much of the  
milk sold today contains a possible potent cancer-causing agent called  
recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone, or rBGH. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This hormone occurs naturally in cows but scientists can now clone it  
and give it to the animals in larger doses than they would normally  
produce, thereby increasing milk production about 10 to 15 percent.   
Perhaps five percent of all milk sold now is produced this way. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Epstein's claim--in a journal which is neither peer-reviewed nor  
widely read (I had never even heard of it before)--is that IGF-1, a  
hormone responsible for cell growth and division, is more abundant and  
potent in milk from rBGH-treated cows. The hormone may act "indirectly  
by sensitizing the breast to subsequent unrelated risk factors" such  
as radiation. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yes, and it may give you super powers and allow you to leap tall  
buildings with a single bound, but there's precious little evidence  
for either hypothesis. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Epstein's allegation uses no new evidence and indeed his charge isn't  
new.  He's been on the warpath against rBGH since at least 1989, when  
it was moving through the approval process. Cancer is just one several  
nasties he accuses it of causing, including increasing the chance of  
contaminating milk with pus from an infection of the udders called  
mastitis. Yuk! 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During these six years of attempted sabotage, Epstein's claims have  
been repeatedly rebuffed by the best names in the business.  The  
Journal of the National Institutes of Health Research has reported  
that Epstein's "scientific evidence is slim" and is based on a single  
31-year-old paper by endocrinologist Peter Forsham.  Forsham, it said,  
"called Epstein's interpretation of his work `ridiculous.'" 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Agencies and respected organizations such as the American Cancer  
Society (ACS),  the American Medical Association (AMA), the FDA, the  
National Institutes of Health, the American Dietetic Association, and  
the World Health Organization have all put their stamps of approval on  
rBGH and strongly repudiated Epstein. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The bottom line in the scientific community, "An AMA spokesman  
recently reiterated, "that there is no evidence that there's any link  
to anything that could be hazardous to your health." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The ACS points out that, "Extensive testing and research [have] shown  
that [rBGH] is indistinguishable from natural bovine growth hormone  
and thus entails no health risks for consumers."  Not only that,  
rBGH actually can't do what Epstein claims. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His  theory assumes that the hormone can enter and remain viable in  
the digestive tract.  But as Dr. Michael J. MacDonald, a University of  
Wisconsin pediatric endocrinologist who studies the effects of  
hormones on children has pointed out, IGF-1 is produced not in the  
stomach but the liver, and if it entered the digestive system, stomach  
acids and enzymes would destroy it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If it got into milk it wouldn't be absorbed," he told a reporter.   
"It's a protein. It would be digested." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'd drink it any time," he said of milk from rBGH-treated cows, "and  
if my children were infants, I'd feed it to them." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Epstein, you see, is one of the three horsemen of the cancer  
apocalypse.  (The other two are Devra Lee Davis, now with the Public  
Health Service, and Dr. David Rall, retired director of the National  
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences). There's an excellent  
chance that if you're hearing that we are suffering an epidemic of  
cancer from man-made causes, be it from petroleum products,  
pesticides, or now Bessie the Cow--you're hearing it from, or at least  
because of, them. 
 <BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He has testified before Congress that 70 to 90 percent of cancer cases  
result from man-made products.  In a just-released video critical of  
his positions, "Science Under Siege" produced by the Competitive  
Enterprise Institute and National Empowerment Television, Epstein  
tells the audience, "Escalating increasing [sic] cancer rates over  
recent decades is a result of exposure to avoidable carcinogens in  
air, water, and food and the workplace." 
 <BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Epstein regularly makes such preposterous statements, which I know  
because the media just as regularly repeat them. He is the fair-haired  
boy of  the apocalyptic environmental movement and of the media.  A  
search on the Nexis database of magazines, newspapers, and some TV  
news broadcasts pulled up 318 references to both Epstein and cancer. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This time, though, from what I could tell, the media weren't so  
credulous. Consistently they allowed somebody to refute Epstein's  
mooings. Let's hope next time reporters ignore this quack altogether  
and devote precious news print to real problems. This fair-haired boy  
has long since cried "wolf" too often to be taken seriously. 
<BR>

author of the book Science Under Siege on which the video is based.

<P>  
What if the media told you that declining prices across the board were 
a sign that inflation was again rearing its ugly head?  What if they 
told you that sharp drops in murder and assault rates nationally 
indicated that crime was on the upswing?  Wouldn't you be in the least 
bit suspicious, even if you didn't come from Missouri, the "show-me 
state"? 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That's the sense you may have gotten lately in reading articles in the 
national media about how this incredible bun-freezing winter we've 
been having is evidence of global warming.  When we have an especially 
hot summer, they say it's global warming.  Now that records for cold 
temperatures are snapping like so many icicles and the northeast has 
just dug out of its worst blizzard in decades, we're told that's proof 
of global warming, too.  Ever heard of the expression, "Heads I win; 
tails you lose?" 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there it was, the cover of the January 22 Newsweek: "Blizzards, 
Floods & Hurricanes:  Blame Global Warming." There also was the New 
York Times front-page article by William K. Stevens: "Blame Global 
Warming for the Blizzard," and a nationally syndicated article by 
environmentalist Jessica Matthews which ran under such titles as 
"Brrr, Global Warming Brings Our Blizzard." 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not surprisingly, these writers have established careers as global 
warming doomsayers.  Stevens harps on it so incessantly as to 
practically put to shame the Roman Senator Cato who insisted upon 
ending every speech with "Carthage must be destroyed." 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sure, sometimes counter-intuitive things happen. That's why somebody 
invented the term "paradox."  But, doomsayers, the idea of warming 
causing freezing cold pushes that just too far. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There's a silliness about [attributing blizzards to global warming] 
that's just overwhelming," says MIT climatologist Richard Lindzen. 
"Were global warming to occur," he notes, "you would have reduced 
temperature variance."  That's because extreme cold comes from wind 
blowing down from the north. If the north and south poles warm the 
most, as global warming climate models predict, the north would be far 
less likely to produce the kind of icy blasts it has sent to us these 
past few weeks. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Lindzen adds, "The truth of the matter is the poles haven't warmed 
and the storms we're having now produce very cold weather because the 
climate has not behaved the way the models have said they should." 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;University of Virginia climatologist Pat Michaels agrees that extremes 
in temperature would actually decrease if the world grew warmer, from 
night to day and month to month.  "The season to season extremes are 
decreasing," says Michaels. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then how to explain this terrible cold weather if it's not caused by 
warming?  Hmm, that's a toughy. Could it be that when it comes to the 
weather, the abnormal is often the norm? To borrow from one of the 
more vulgar expressions of the day: Bad Weather Happens. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But to global warming enthusiasts, any and all aberrations are proof 
that the sky is falling.  Thus, last year's high number of dangerous 
hurricanes was again cited as proof of the warming effect. It made an 
encore on Newsweek's January 22 cover.  

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet according to a paper by eight prominent researchers in the 
November 1994 Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, coastal 
inhabitants can rest easy. They wrote, "year to year variations" in 
weather "are so great that they must effectively  swamp' any quite 
modest effect" of  global warming on hurricane frequency. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Global warming enthusiasts desperately grasp at anything to prove 
their  case.  In early January the Climatic Research Unit at the 
University of East Anglia made headlines, including the New York 
Times, with a preliminary report saying 1995 was the hottest year on 
record.  But their data was actually for only 11 months. Rather than 
risk December's temperatures spoiling everything they jumped the gun 
and sent out their press releases. Their fears where fulfilled when 
December's average temperature came in at the lowest in 17 years 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It was a pretty ordinary year," said NASA scientist John Christy, who 
has been analyzing satellite data on temperature since 1979. And James 
Hansen of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, who pretty much 
started the whole global warming scare, admits his study of land 
areas--where the effects of global warming would be most severe--
revealed 1995 was about 0.02 degrees centigrade cooler than 1990. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, the theory of global warming continues to be just that--an 
unproven theory. And even were it valid, the theory cannot explain 
blizzards and cold snaps. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And where does this weather unfit for man or polar bear leave global 
warming skeptics? Just as they have always claimed that an 
exceptionally hot summer doesn't prove global warming, they cannot now 
claim that an exceptionally cold winter disproves it.  And they 
haven't. I've yet to any global warming skeptic make such a claim. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Global warming doomsayers have had similar opportunities for honesty. 
Instead, the likes of Stevens and Matthews went for sensational 
headlines.  To them, any well-publicized weather story is an 
opportunity to promote their pet theory.  

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No, the theory of global warming hasn't been disproved. But clearly 
some of its more fervent enthusiasts need to step back, look at the 
evidence, and chill out.

<h2>
Will the U.S. Repeat Peru's Deadly Chlorine Folly?
</h2>

<P>
FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA You may have heard the term "red death."  It  
dates back to the middle ages, which is where most North Americans  
probably imagine it.  But it has a modern name: cholera.  And if you  
live in Peru or any of 14 other South American countries, it's very  
real and right now--thanks in part to bad advice from the U.S.  
Environmental Protection Agency.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Enrique Ghersi's voice shook with emotion as he described the  
situation to a gathering here of Latin American, British, and U.S.  
policymakers at the Atlas Foundation Workshop on Science, Technology  
and the Environment in Fort Lauderdale. Ten thousand Latin Americans  
have died, according to the Pan American Health Organization, and more  
than a million made sick.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ghersi blames "U.S. imperialism." But this imperialism didn't come at  
the point of a bayonet as it has so many times in the past.  Rather it  
came from EPA pronouncements regarding the chlorination of drinking  
water.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Chlorine is the most effective killer of bacteria, including that  
which causes cholera,  in water supplies.  While other techniques such  
as ozonation or using ultra-violet light can kill bacteria at the  
point of contact, chlorine added to water keeps on killing all the way  
to the faucet.  New contaminants  after the water leaves the treatment  
facility are still eliminated.  About three-fourths of all U.S.  
drinking water is chlorinated, while most of the rest is treated with  
a combination of chlorine and ammonia.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Chlorination and disinfection of the water supplies are the public  
health success stories of the century," says Carol Henry, director of  
the International Life Sciences Risk Science Institute.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But the broad class of chemicals known as chlorines have lately has  
been under an all-out assault by American environmentalists, who  
accuse them of everything from thinning the ozone layer to causing  
cancer to reducing sperm counts to shrinking alligators' penises.   
(Question: How do you measure an alligator's penis? Answer: Very  
carefully.)  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greenpeace International, using the pithy if not overly imaginative  
slogan "Chlorine kills!" (meaning people, not germs), has demanded the  
elimination of all man-made chlorines in use.  This  while leaving  
alone those which occur naturally, such as sodium chloride, better  
known as table salt.  Such a drastic move, according to the consulting  
firm Charles River Associates, would cost the economy $91 billion a  
year.  Other critics say it would cost many American lives, pointing  
to Peru as an example.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What happened in Peru is that their government took the  
environmentalists and the EPA more seriously than ours has so far.   
The EPA has to a great extent bought into the environmentalist anti- 
chlorinated chemical rhetoric, with Administrator Carol Browner  
calling for reducing, if not eliminating, use of chlorines.  The EPA  
has also made much of the fact that some studies have shown a   
slightly increased risk of cancer from drinking chlorinated water.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
We Norte-Americanos, who have become somewhat resistant to the  
"everything man-made causes cancer" cries of the environmentalists and  
the EPA, have taken thus far a sane attitude towards this.  Berkeley  
biologist Bruce Ames has noted that if there is any risk of cancer  
from chlorinated water at all, it is a thirtieth that of a serving of  
peanut butter.  But Peruvian bureaucrats bought the rhetoric wholesale  
and greatly reduced the chlorine pumped into the country's water  
supply.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This set the stage for horror when, Pan American Health Organization  
officials suspect, a Chinese freighter released its cholera- 
contaminated bilge water into the harbor in Lima.  Eventually the  
bacteria made its way into open wells which hadn't been chlorinated at  
all and in other fresh water supplies in which chlorine levels had  
fallen too low to kill the germ.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As is usual with epidemics, the rich have fared considerably better  
than the poor. Peru's rich can afford private water supplies and  
bottled water.  It is the poor, says Ghersi, who "have been sacrificed  
for the EPA and the environmentalists."    
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Undaunted by all this, the EPA is now taking action that may well  
endanger much of the U.S. water supply.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Citing the hypothetical cancer risks from chlorination, the agency in  
1994 proposed a rule that would require water systems across the  
country to eliminate the process known as pre-disinfection as a means  
of controlling "disinfection by-products."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
According to some officials, this unfunded mandate would cost local  
governments an additional $4 million a year and might force small  
water systems to abandon chlorination completely.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The proposed water regulation has some health officials absolutely  
boiling.  "Reducing chlorine levels in public water systems poses an  
immediate and significant threat to public health," says Douglas  
Kinard of the South Carolina Department of Public Health. "A  
conscientious health professional with experience in waterborne  
disease outbreaks should not support a rule which compromises public  
health."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Or, as Robert Forbes of the Florida Department of Health and  
Rehabilitative Services put it, "the reduction or elimination of  
chlorination of drinking water to reduce the risk of . . . disease, is  
analogous to reducing or eliminating air travel to protect people on  
the ground from being hit by falling aircraft parts!"  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Enrique Ghersi hopes that won't happen here as it has in his homeland.  
"We're ahead of the U.S.," Ghersi told me sarcastically.  "And have  
returned to the Middle Ages as a result."

<title>Fumento: Study Finds Pesticides Not the Problem, Eating Habits Is  -- 2/20/96</title>

<h2>
Study Finds Pesticides Not the Problem, Eating Habits Is
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

<P>
At least once a year, it seems, Americans are hit by a carpet bomb 
attack orchestrated by environmental groups and the media.  The theme: 
Our food supply is killing us because of pesticides used by greedy 
corporations and chemical companies.  Anyone who denies it is accused 
of being a dupe of industry.  But now a counter-attack has been 
launched by the highly influential and independent National Research 
Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Far from posing the clear and present danger that the environmental 
groups say they do, the NRC says that the synthetic chemicals that 
prove carcinogenic in large-dose rodent testing are greatly 
outnumbered by natural chemicals which do the same thing. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The good news is that according to the report, neither seems to pose 
much risk. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"While some chemicals in the diet do have the ability to cause cancer, 
they appear to be a threat only when they are present in foods that 
form an unusually large part of the diet," said Ronald Estabrook, 
chairman of the NRC committee.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What really counts, the report says, is not those things we 
unknowingly take into our bodies in minuscule quantities, but rather 
foods that we intentionally ingest in  massive doses: fats, calories, 
and alcohol. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the report specifically looked at cancer, it certainly bears 
noting that the worst thing about these ingredients is their ability 
to induce death not from cancer but from obesity, heart disease, and 
liver damage.  Further, another dietary component, fiber, has been 
strongly tied to a reduced incidence of cancer and heart disease. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In other words, if you're really worried about cancer or your health 
in general, these are the things to concentrate on.  It means, 
essentially, doing what your mom told you to do: eat more fruits and 
vegetables and consume anything else in moderation. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet only one in five American children eat five or more servings of 
fruits and vegetables a day, the government's dietary recommendation. 
We get a third of the fiber we're supposed to.  At the same time, 
Americans are taking in more calories than ever and have made 
themselves the fattest western nation on earth, causing an estimated 
300,000 premature deaths each year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Environmental groups have effectively scared many Americans away from 
fresh produce.  The Alar campaign in 1989 remains the most prominent.  
Orchestrated by the Natural Resources Defense Council, it had 60 
Minutes declaring the apple growth regulator Alar, "The most potent 
cancer-causing agent in our food supply."  Actress Meryl Streep 
appeared before Congress to blubber and demand, speaking of course on 
behalf of all mothers, that chemicals like Alar be yanked.  It was. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet the Alar campaign was only one of many environmentalist-media 
joint efforts. "Do I Dare to Eat a Strawberry?" ran the title of a New 
York Times article last fall, promoting a paper by the Environmental 
Working Group. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These scares have doubtless impacted buying habits but have had even 
greater impact on regulatory agencies--especially the EPA, which feels 
a need to react to each new horror story. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"I'm very concerned about diets," says Berkeley biologist Bruce Ames, 
the scientist whose research into natural carcinogens inspired the NRC 
report. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 "If you don't get enough vitamin C," he told me, "it's like stepping 
unprotected in front of an X-ray machine. And we're spending no money 
trying to get the poor to eat better diets and we're taking on average 
of  $2,000 from each family for EPA regulations.  I think we just have 
our priorities completely out of whack." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That goes for both personal priorities and national ones. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On a personal level, we contentedly stuff our faces with Ho-Hos, 
Twinkies, and Big Macs. And while getting significantly more fiber is 
as easy as buying whole wheat bread instead of white, Americans 
overwhelmingly choose white bread, safe in the belief that the 
government is regulating away any and all types of cancer. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nationally, it's time for the feds to end what could be called the rat 
race--the assumption that says that anytime a synthetic chemical in a 
huge dose (typically several hundred thousand times what a human would 
take in) promotes cancer in a laboratory rodent, we must race to 
regulate or ban it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's also time to get rid of the notion (common among 
environmentalists) that whatever nature makes is harmless while 
anything developed in a lab is harmful. As the NRC report--and a mass 
of other evidence--shows, a carcinogen is a carcinogen.  If it's 
present in significant enough amounts to invite regulation, then the 
regulations should apply whether the source was Ma Nature or Dow 
Chemical. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"This suggests we need to look at both natural and synthetic 
pesticides, compare them, and come up with better tests," says Fran 
Smith, president of the Washington-based Consumer Alert. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, the committee said more naturally occurring chemicals should 
be individually tested for their ability to cause cancer, starting 
with those that are found in the highest concentrations in commonly 
consumed foods.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But don't count the environmentalist groups out yet.  Over the last 
few years, as their case against synthetic chemicals causing cancer 
has grown weaker and weaker, they've started blaming them for other 
problems.  These include immune dysfunction and declining sperm 
counts.  If it's true that you just can't keep a good man down, that 
goes double for a bad environmentalist.

<title>Fumento: Implant Tests Cashing in on Junk Science  -- 2/27/96</title>

<h2>
Implant Tests Cashing in on Junk Science 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
"Government Warns on Breast Implants," ran the title of a recent AP 
story. The title was misleading. The issue wasn't breast implants but 
tests claiming to show that such implants may have caused harm. And 
this is a real shame because behind that false headline lies a story 
about one of the greatest health hoaxes of the decade and of how junk 
science permeates the courtroom. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The brief article itself was accurate as far as it went. It informed 
readers that the Food and Drug Administration has warned doctors 
against using unapproved tests to detect antibodies to silicone 
leaking into the body from ruptured breast implants or to detect 
illness that silicone may have caused. Antibodies are a defense 
response the body produces to the introduction of a foreign substance. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The article failed to point out that these very tests have played a 
key role in trials against silicone implant manufacturers which 
sometimes return verdicts measured in millions of dollars. Their 
existence no doubt played a part in the manufacturers' consenting to a 
$4.2 billion dollar settlement, the largest personal injury settlement 
in history. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The article also didn't say that these tests are essentially a scam--
worthless except that, yes, they can pull in verdicts of millions of 
dollars. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The tests generally claim to work by one of three methods: detecting 
chemicals given off by the silicone implant; finding antibodies 
created by the body in reaction to the silicone; or detecting 
antibodies created in reaction to the body's own proteins that have 
been somehow modified by the implant. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Part of the problem with any silicone-detecting test is that we're all 
continually exposed to silicone from a number of sources, including 
puddings, cake mixes, antacids, and lipstick. Diabetics are exposed to 
relatively high levels of silicone as well, through repeated 
injections. Indeed, the very pouch that contains the silicone gel of a 
breast implant is itself made of a form of silicone. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of this, the British Department of Health stated in a 1995 
report: "The fact that anti-silicone antibodies have been detected 
both in silicone implant recipients and, at a lower titre [level], in 
people who had not received medical silicones, raises doubts about 
their significance." The report went on to exonerate silicone implants 
of the charges against them: 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet, the scam-artist inventors of these tests have enjoyed great 
success pushing their traveling medicine show. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consider the case of Dr. Nir Kossovsky of the UCLA, an inventor of one 
of the types of tests the FDA warned against. Kossovsky is one of the 
best-known critics of silicone implants, has testified at the FDA 
hearings that resulted in the essential ban on silicone breast 
implants, and is a regular expert witness for plaintiffs in implant-
related trials. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Kossovsky developed what he called Detecsil, for "detect silicone." 
"The Detecsil test confirms whether or not an individual has developed 
an immune response to silicone-associated proteins," declared an 
advertisement. As such, it could be useful in showing whether women 
with autoimmune disease (in which the body's immune system turns on 
itself) got that illness from silicone. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In legal depositions supporting his expert witness testimony, 
Kossovsky cited tests from the famed Scripps Clinic and Research 
Foundation in La Jolla, California as corroborating his own.  In fact, 
Scripps researchers found the antibodies of autoimmune disease victims 
were the same regardless of whether they had silicone implants or not. 
All the test found was that there was a higher level of antibodies in 
anybody with autoimmune disease, exactly what one would expect. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Scripps has repeatedly to disavowed Kossovsky's statements. Indeed, a 
Scripps researcher was on record as saying, "To my knowledge, there is 
no test that can predict or indicate any specific immune response to 
silicone," which is what the test must do to prove adverse health 
effects. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even before this latest public FDA warning, Kossovsky had been warned 
by the Agency to quit using his test. But the damage has been done. 
The test has played a crucial role in numerous implant trials, 
including ones with verdicts of $7 million, $25 million, and an 
incredible $40 million. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Then consider the case of another company making claims for a test 
able to detect silicone antibodies in women with autoimmune disease. 
It was developed by Emerald Biomedical Services of Woodlands, Texas. 
Dr. Noel Rose of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, one of the 
most prominent researchers in the field, contacted Emerald to see if 
he could confirm their findings. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Originally he did, but later he found the same positive reactions in 
women without silicone implants. He informed Emerald the test appeared 
useless, and Emerald sent Rose a letter telling him in politest terms 
to go play in the traffic. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nonetheless Emerald persisted in sending out information packets to 
potential clients boasting that Rose had validated their study--until 
being warned to desist by Johns Hopkins lawyers. In that same packet, 
Emerald offered their services as an expert plaintiffs' witness and 
bragged about the large settlements their test and testimony had 
helped win. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At last Kossovsky and Emerald have been put in their place. But not 
before their tests terrified countless numbers of women and wreaked 
havoc in a major sector of American industry. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's always been a false cliche that crime doesn't pay. It does, and 
so does its close relative, junk science.

<h2>
Sugar, The Everglades... And Big Government
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
Poor Al Gore.  Even when he correctly diagnoses a problem, he just 
can't come up with a solution that doesn't involve Big Government--
even when Big Government  is the problem in the first place. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Case in point: the threat to one of the world's most magnificent and 
important eco-systems, the Florida Everglades. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This threat is primarily from sugar farming, which uses up more and 
more of this precious land every year.  Far worse, huge amounts--as 
much as 80 percent--of the phosphorous used in fertilizing sugar cane 
in Florida drains into the Everglades. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This sets off  a chain reaction, stimulating growth among bacteria and 
algae and also fostering the growth of cattails which choke off the 
marshes, ruining nesting places and destroying animal food supplies. 
Thousands of acres have been overrun by these super cattails. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The farming has also dramatically reduced the flow of fresh water from 
Lake Okeechobee into the Everglades, again damaging the eco-system.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Gore's solution to this is a tax-and-spend Democrat's solution to all 
problems--raise taxes and spend them.  Tax all sugar growers a penny a 
pound and spend the money to buy as much as 140,000 acres back from 
farmers to convert them back to marshlands.  His explanation is that 
we already subsidize sugar 18 cents per pound, so really we'd just be 
cutting their subsidy. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Alas, the situation isn't nearly that simple. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, the government does not directly subsidize sugar. It does 
guarantee sugar farmers a minimum of 18 cents return per pound, but it 
never pays any of that out.  Rather it enforces import restrictions to 
prop the price of sugar up.  Sugar in this country currently 
wholesales for about 23 to 24 cents a pound, about twice the cost 
globally. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So what Gore is proposing isn't holding back a bit on a subsidy, it's 
just a tax, and one that will leave the import restrictions completely 
intact. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet it's the import restrictions that are the real cause of the 
problem.  By artificially inflating the production value of sugar, 
they encourage industry to grow far more crops than they otherwise 
would.  In 1981, 334,000 acres of Everglades were used for sugar 
farming; today the number is about half a million acres. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Get rid of the protections and farming in the Everglades will plunge.  
If this puts sugar cropland back to its 1981 level, it will give us 
back 166,000 acres of wetlands--26,000 more than the Gore proposal.  
It will also greatly reduce the price that Americans pay to prop up 
Big Sugar's profits.  In all, the sugar program is estimated to cost 
consumers $1.4 billion a year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But what if this doesn't go far enough in helping the Everglades?  
Then step two would be to levy a tax on the polluters themselves, the 
farms in the Everglades.  Taxing beet farmers in Louisiana to pay for 
damage caused by cane farmers in Florida is hardly fair, nor does it 
accomplish the purpose of discouraging environmentally harmful 
farming. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Actually, steps one and two will complement each other.  That's 
because by getting rid of the import restrictions, the price of sugar 
cane farmland in the Everglades will drop considerably.  Far less tax 
money would be needed to buy up crop land and turn it back to the 
egrets, eagles, and alligators. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Big Sugar will scream that this is all terribly unfair.  Competition?  
Why, it's downright un-American!  Further, 420,000 American jobs will 
be lost, they claim, as the American sugar industry folds.  Actually, 
the USDA says that sugar farmers employ about 46,000 people 
nationwide, including perhaps 15,000 in Florida.  In any case, the 
sugar industry would hardly fold and the  government could use 
lowering our sugar import restrictions to pry open markets in other 
countries which would create American jobs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, both the House and the Senate have just thrown away 
chances to reduce or eliminate Big Sugar's protection.  That may have 
something to do with all the sweet green stuff the industry spreads 
around.  Together, the sugar cane, sugar beat and corn sweetener 
interests contributed almost $12 million to candidates for federal 
office from 1979 through 1994, according to the Washington-based 
Center for Responsive Politics. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But if the Clinton Administration wants to do the right thing, there's 
still time to insist that the new farm legislation does so.  If only 
it can get over its belief that Big Government is the solution to a 
problem that Big Government's largesse to Big Sugar created in the 
first place.

<h2>
Procter & Gamble's Non-Fat Fat: Neither Satan Nor (Sigh) Savior 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
Okay, so it wasn't Time magazine's &quot;Man of the Year,&quot; but it came 
awfully close, making the cover of the January 8, 1996 issue. The 
subject was Procter & Gamble's remarkable fat substitute olestra, to 
be marketed under the name Olean. It's been hailed as a powerful 
weapon in the battle of the increasingly bulging American bulge. It's 
also been portrayed as a death-dealing villain. It is neither. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Food and Drug Administration has now approved olestra -- the first 
artificial fat available that can be used in the baking and frying 
process -- to be used in potato chips, taco chips, and crackers.  
Later P & G may request the FDA to approve it for use in such goodies 
as cakes, brownies, and french fries. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to most taste-testers, to the tongue foods made with olestra 
are identical to those made with real fat.  But to the body, olestra 
may as well be Teflon, since it literally slides through the 
intestines without stopping off to visit arteries, hips, or 
waistlines. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The FDA approved the fake fat over the objections of some scientists 
and consumer advocates, who warn that it has unusual risks.  Some 
studies have shown that as little as two ounces of olestra chips can 
act as a laxative. It can also cause other gastrointestinal 
difficulties including a condition called (forgive me; but science 
writers must sometimes be gross) &quot;anal leakage.&quot; 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But as such it will hardly be alone among favorite foods.  One needn't 
be familiar with the famous scene in the movie &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; to 
know the effect that beans can have.  And if you eat more than a few 
prunes or other dried fruits at one sitting you may well find yourself 
doing several more sittings somewhere else. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In any event, the FDA approval requires labeling the product to this 
effect.  My guess, though, is that the label will often be ignored by 
overzealous consumers -- though probably ignored only once. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More alarming is olestra's ability to wash out of the body certain 
nutrients believed important for preventing disease. While P&G will 
fortify olestra with vitamins A, D, E, and K, it will not add back a 
controversial class of nutrients known as carotenoids, which many 
believe protect against cancer.  P & G says evidence for that is 
lacking. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This nutrient depletion &quot;could potentially produce a large number of 
deaths annually and major morbidity in the U.S. population,&quot; Dr. Meir 
Stampfer of Harvard University wrote the FDA. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But P & G's agnostic position has repeatedly been boosted recently by 
one study after another finding that the Vitamin-A derivative beta 
carotene, a carotenoid, apparently provides  no cancer-fighting 
effects. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Institutes of Health in December told the FDA that nobody 
knows if depletions at the levels olestra causes would really harm 
anyone.  But certainly one factor that boosts P & G's position is that 
for the most part, olestra can only wash out whatever went in with it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Eat spinach and Pringle's potato chips together and you're going to 
lose the benefit of the spinach.  Alas, people are a lot more likely 
to combine the potato chips with dip and a beer or soda pop than with 
nutritious vegetables. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But if olestra isn't the anti-Christ, it may not prove much of a 
savior, either. &quot;By replacing the fat in snacks, Olean can help 
millions of Americans cut excess fat and move closer to achieving an 
important dietary health goal,&quot; says P&G Chairman John Pepper.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I'd say more like thousands, and here's why.  Americans have been 
hoodwinked into believing that anything that's fat free won't make 
them fat. They've bought tens of millions of books and videos from 
shysters like Susan (&quot;Stop the Insanity&quot;) Powter and Martin (&quot;The T-
Factor Diet&quot;) Katahn telling them exactly that. They so fervently want 
to believe it that they do. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But they're wrong.  Any energy consumed that is not burned off 
immediately becomes fat.  True, if you ate two ounces of potato chips 
cooked in olestra rather than fat, you'd have just 120 calories 
instead of 300.  For that matter, you could eat four ounces of olestra 
chips and still come out slightly ahead. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But if Americans could stand to eat that few chips, they wouldn't need 
fat substitutes in the first place and we wouldn't be the fattest 
nation on the face of the earth. Overeating is our problem and 
olestra, far from curing it, will only encourage it among many people. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consider the experience with artificial sweeteners such as saccharin 
and aspartame (NutraSweet), which provide virtually no calories. Their 
use tripled in the 1980s and should have caused sugar consumption to 
decline and caloric intake to decline.  Instead even as artificial 
sweetener consumption has increased so has sugar intake, caloric 
intake, and Americans' waistlines.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That said, if you have the discipline to simply swap artificial 
sweeteners for sugar and don't tell yourself that a Diet Coke allows 
you to eat an extra piece of fried chicken, you can come out ahead of 
the game. Likewise, if you eat ten olestra potato chips instead of ten 
fat-fried potato chips, you win. It's a matter of free will and having 
the strength to exercise it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That's why the FDA's decision was a good one. Government can protect 
us from dangerous substances, but government cannot protect us from 
ourselves.

<title>Fumento: The (Literally) Unspeakable Evil at Dunblane  -- 3/25/96</title>

<h2>
The (Literally) Unspeakable Evil at Dunblane 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
A gunman bursts into the gymnasium of a small Scottish grade school.  
He begins firing, systematically hunting down nearly every child in 
the room.  Before he finishes and ends his own life with a blast to 
the brain, sixteen "wee ones" and their teacher lay dead in a huge, 
spreading pool of blood. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is an act of unmitigated evil.  Or is it?  Apparently it depends on 
whose newspapers you read. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I happened to be in Ireland at the time of the shooting, exposed to 
the coverage of the Irish and British press.  Every article I read, it 
seems, used the terms "monster," "pervert," and "evil" to describe the 
slayer, Thomas Hamilton.  There were some examples of this in the 
American media, as well. Time magazine's article included the words "a 
monster goes on the rampage" and Time essayist Lance Morrow focused on 
the element of evil.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But far more typical was this Associated Press line.  "A 43-year-old 
loner with an unsavory reputation massacred more than half of Dunblane 
Primary School's kindergarten class and its teacher on Wednesday, then 
shot himself dead."  Indeed, "loner" was the American media's chief 
descriptor of Hamilton. That's like summarizing George Washington as a 
man with a powedered wig or Abraham Lincoln as merely being tall. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As to his "unsavory reputation," what the paper means is that he 
papered his walls with photos of little boys in various states of 
undress.  It means he was kicked out of the Boy Scouts for having 
little boys disrobe in front of him.  The kids called him "Mr. 
Creepie."  How do you get from this that he merely had an "unsavory 
reputation"? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The British media pulled no punches.  "Residents Say Scottish Killer 
Was Evil Pervert," ran the headline of the Reuters news service story 
out of Scotland.  "What has happened reminds us of the depths to which 
human evil can sink," concluded the London Evening Standard."  The 
London Daily Mirror referred to "evil Thomas Hamilton."    
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why has the American media been so reticent about calling this man 
what he is? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"At the foundation of all this is the Left's rejection of religion and 
fundamental to that is the question of whether human beings are 
capable of evil or not," says Rabbi Daniel Lapin, President of Toward 
Tradition and a radio talk show host in Seattle.  "The whole of 
western thought has always been based on the idea that there is evil 
of which people are [inherently] capable . . . " 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Left, he says, argues that since "no human beings capable of doing 
wrong things, evil must come from the institutions of society," 
usually but not always the church. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Certaintly had this happened in the United States, the media would 
have done what they've  always done with shootings: blamed the 
institution of lax gun laws.  But because it happened in a nation with 
some of the strictest gun laws, they were  left foundering. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet,  the American media seem to  have trouble believing even some 
institutions can be evil.  These, after all, are the same people who 
to this day snort, chuckle, and guffaw when they refer to President 
Reagan's description of  the Soviet Union as an "evil empire."  As if 
there could possibly be a better term for a state that murdered tens 
of millions of people, kept hundreds of millions of others in bondage, 
and kept a nuclear arsenal trained on those whom it couldn't 
subjugate.  The British media, by contrast, treated and continues to 
treat Reagan's words with deference. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Robert Royal, vice-president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in 
Washington, D.C., attributes the media's reticence to our having "made 
ourselves into such a therapeutic society that we don't like to think 
people have choices in right or wrong . . . .  If something goes wrong 
it's a sort of chemical malfunction, [and] people are not responsible 
for what they do." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Or a psychological malfunction, says the Rev. Robert Sirico, President 
of the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty in Grand 
Rapids, Michigan.  The media "have to characterize in psychological 
terms, not moral ones.  Evil is just something we don't understand," 
he says. He adds that, "Morality is grounded in human free will," 
something else the media doesn't accept.  "If it turns out a child 
abuser was abused by his father, it exonerates him," he says.  "Since 
the media doesn't accept free will, it can't accept good or evil." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's "a very sophisticated amoral logic," he says.  But unlike true 
logic, it is ultimately incapable of explaining anything. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is what happens if you remove the concepts of good and evil. 
Without the context of the Civil War and slavery, Abraham Lincoln 
truly was only a president who happened to be tall; without the 
Revolutionary War and the Continental Congress and its aftermath, 
George Washington was just a president with a wig. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Call Thomas Hamilton anything you want--43 years old, a loner, fat, 
bald, bespectacled.  But if you don't call him evil, you're omitting  
what set him apart from the world's other five billion people that 
day.   As Time's Lance Morrow put it in the title of his essay, "Only 
the Vocabulary of Evil Could Explain What Happened at Dunblane."

Echoes of a Famine from 150 Years Ago

GALWAY, REPUBLIC OF IRELAND
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Grown men wept at the sight.  Women screamed and tore their hair.  
Some fainted.  For they knew that from Galway Bay to Dublin, from Cork 
to Belfast, death would soon stalk the land.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The event was the infestation of the Ireland's potato crop with "late 
blight." It was to spark the "Great Hunger," the 150th anniversary of 
which we mark this year.  Before it ended, a million Irish had died, 
and perhaps a million more had emigrated, and the future of Ireland -- 
and the United States, where most of the emigres landed -- would be 
forever changed.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Botanists will tell you the famine was caused by the fungus 
Phytophthora infestans.  Yet wrong-headed government policies had at 
least as much to do with it.  As one Dubliner put it to me during my 
visit, "Where you see famine, politics must lie  just below the 
surface."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Before the famine, the Irish had been among the healthiest people in 
Europe.  Their usual daily diet was potatoes.  These comprised perhaps 
60 percent of the food for the people in general but close to 100 
percent for those in the poorer west and southwest regions of the 
country.  Potatoes could be grown economically even on the tiny 
parcels of land the Irish Catholics were allowed to cultivate. 
Further, they thrived even in the rocky, damp earth of the western 
part of the island.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The menu was monotonous but highly nutritious. If you ate enough -- 
and the Irish men ate as many as 14 pounds a day -- they supplied 
virtually every vitamin and nutrient your body needed.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But in 1845, this godsend became a deadly liability.  That's when the 
late blight first appeared.  (Ironically, it could have been the 
result of importing a new strain of potato from America to make the 
current strain healthier.) The blight moved so quickly you could 
practically watch its progression, and in a matter of days a field 
would be destroyed.  Like a dark veil it spread across parts of 
continental Europe, then England, and then hopped across the Irish 
channel.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Poor farmers watched in horror as their green field turned black and 
then began to give off a stench like putrefying flesh.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Still, in 1845 the blight only claimed about 60 percent of what would 
have been a bumper crop in Ireland.  Food in storage was enough to 
tide the population over for a year.  But when the late blight 
appeared again the next year, the stores had been exhausted and 
suffering would begin that the Irish to this day have not forgotten.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many people died from outright starvation.  Autopsies performed on the 
dead would find their bodies entirely devoid of food.  Many more, 
however, in their weakened state, succumbed to "famine fever," a 
general term describing illness from typhus, dysentery, and cholera.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Reported the Cork Examiner of the poor in its community:
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Death is in every hovel; disease and famine, its dread precursors, 
have fastened on the young and old, the strong and the feeble, the 
mother  and the infant; whole families lie together on the damp floor, 
devoured by fever, without a human being to wet their burning lips or 
raise their languid heads; the husband dies by the side of the wife, 
and she knows not that he is beyond the reach of earthly suffering; 
the same rag covers the festering remains of mortality and the 
skeleton forms of their living, who are unconscious of the horrible 
contiguity; rats devour the corpse, and there is no energy among the 
living to scare them from their horrid banquet; fathers bury their 
children without a sigh, and cover them in shallow graves, round which 
no weeping mother, no sympathizing friends, are grouped; one scanty 
funeral is followed by another and another.  Without food or fuel, bed 
or bedding, whole families are shut up in naked hovels, dropping one 
by one into the arms of death.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the potato failure, much of this suffering was not inevitable.  
For just as was the case recently in Ethiopia and Somalia, crop 
failures play on a part in famines.  The rest comes from the failure 
of government.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ireland was at the time actually a part, albeit reluctantly so, of the 
wealthiest nation on earth, the United Kingdom.  But many in Britain 
loathed its people.  In those days before CNN, British papers often 
depicted  the Irish as slothful and stupid "bogtrotters."  British 
cartoonists depicted them as hairless apes.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like today, the government promised much and delivered little.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Much of Ireland's produce was in grains, but these continued to leave 
port for English and other destinations.  Some food was imported, but 
then as today, powerful special interest groups prevailed upon the 
government to severely limit imports rather than to hurt their bottom 
lines. Then, as today, the government set up public works projects to 
provide pointless make-work jobs, building roads that began and ended 
nowhere and docks where no port would ever be.  Then, as today, people 
were huddled together in massive projects.  Often as not disease ended 
their stay.  (Today, it would be crime or drugs.)
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today the line, "We're from the government and we're here to help," 
has become a joke.  Back then, nobody laughed.  The hatred they 
developed has survived to this day and plays out in the bitter 
violence of the Irish Republican Army.  The combination of a deadly 
fungus and a deadly government policy continues to be lethal today, 
150 years later.

<h2> How the Media Reward Themselves for Dishonesty 
</h2>

<P>
 
 
When it comes to Gulf War Syndrome (GWS), the evidence keeps going in 
one direction and the media keep going in the other. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the most recent development, the Pentagon has just released its 
latest study.  It looked at almost 19,000 Gulf vets and found, once 
again, that aside from certain psychological problems there's no 
pattern of symptoms to suggest that "Gulf War Syndrome" means anything 
other than any sickness that happens to befall a Gulf vet. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

GWS is essentially a media creation.  Out of the 700,000 vets who 
served in the Gulf, a few began complaining of various but unrelated 
ailments.  Soon the media got ahold of it and pronounced this a 
mystery, as if out of 700,000 men and women after a period of a few 
years, none were supposed to be sick.  When soldiers read of this 
mystery "syndrome" they began assuming, in the way people do, that any 
illness they had was related to it.   At last count, their were over 
75 symptoms attributed to GWS, ranging from life-threatening ones like 
cancer and heart disease to lesser ones like weight loss and weight 
gain, graying hair, kidney stones, thick saliva, hot and cold flashes, 
increased urination, lightheadedness, sensitive teeth, hemorrhoids, 
and a "foot fungus that will not go away." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Most of the symptoms are often connected to psychosomatic illness, 
such as joint pain, memory loss, and headaches.  Others, like semen 
that burns the skin, are as unsubstantiated as Elvis sightings. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Every major study looking for a cause of GWS has found the same thing.  
There just ain't no such animal.  The first two of these came from the 
National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense, and both 
found that other than psychiatric ills induced by stress, Gulf vets 
have no more illness than one would expect.  These studies were 
criticized somewhat for their methodology by the  National Academy of 
Science's Institute of Medicine (IOM), and the media gaily repeated 
that criticism.  But in January the IOM itself concluded there was no 
such thing as GWS. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nevertheless, the media continue to promote the story and to 
congratulate themselves for it.  Life magazine has just won the 1996 
John Bartlow Martin Award for Public Interest Magazine Journalism for 
its November cover story, "The Tiny Victims of Dessert Storm." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The article--which purported to discover a high rate of birth defects 
among children of Gulf War vets--was "a good, tough, moving look at a 
national tragedy," gushed contest judge Doug Balz, managing editor of 
the Chicago Tribune Sunday Magazine.  It worked "on both the heart and 
mind of the reader." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Again, with all those children born to 700,000 vets, you're going to 
have a certain number of problems.   But study after study has found 
no more problems than would be expected.  These include one from the  
Mississippi Department of Health of an alleged birth defect cluster, a 
larger study of 620 pregnancies at Robins Air Force Base, and a 
combined study of 6,392 pregnancies at several bases which found Gulf 
vets' wives' miscarriages at the same level as that population had 
before deployment to the Gulf.  It was also about half the civilian 
rate. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"I think it's unconscionable to frighten people out of reproducing 
unless you have some good data to support that contention," Dr. 
Russell Tarver, who led the Mississippi National Guard investigation, 
told me. "I think you're committing a crime against those veterans." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

That's what Life did.  It carefully ignored each of these studies.  
Instead it simply regaled its readers with touching anecdotes about 
children with birth defects whose parents had become convinced--by 
other stories like Life's--that being endowed with a perfect baby is a 
God-given right which was cruelly taken from them because of their 
service in the Gulf. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Why do the media continue to ignore the evidence in favor of personal 
testimonials from people they themselves have terrified? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 "There's no question that the media tend to look at the negative side 
and the bad news more than the positive side and good news," Los 
Angeles Times news critic David Shaw told me.  "This is particularly 
true of medical problems and health issues because these are things 
about which the people worry the most. That's doubly true when 
children are involved. People tend to throw all skepticism out of the 
window." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Part of the problem, Shaw adds, is the "herd of independent minds" 
phenomenon.  Members of the press corps are loath to write anything 
that will make them seem odd.  "Reporters tend to be more likely to 
parrot the conventional wisdom," says Shaw.  "There's a premium to be 
paid for doing the story that goes against the grain."  And one to be 
gained for going with it, as the Life award shows. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But doesn't accuracy count?  Not usually. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"In the two years I was a judge at the Pulitzers I don't remember 
hearing anybody saying `Let's make phone calls'" to verify what's in a 
story, said Shaw.  I think the assumption is that if there were 
something wrong with the story the paper wouldn't be entering it." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lately there's been a lot of hand-wringing from the media about why it 
seems the public hates them.  Why?  They reward dishonesty and 
incompetence with cover stories of major magazines.  Then they hand 
out awards for those stories.  Good people suffer as a result.  What's 
not to hate?  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<title>Fumento: Latest Scare is a Tempest in a Teapot -- 4/17/96</title>

Latest  Scare is a  Tempest  in a Teapot    
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">

<P>

Where are those tea-heaving Boston patriots when you need them?  Iced    
tea around the country is turning up deadly and the best that can said    
about it is that the British -- already beset by "mad cow disease" --    
don't have to worry about it since they don't like iced tea anyway.    
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
   
Well, actually no one has died from the tea.  Actually, no one has    
even gotten sick from it.  But that hasn't stopped the media from    
using such sound-bite headlines as "Killer Tea" and "Bad Brew."  Nor    
has it stopped major chains such as Wendy's, Kentucky Fried Chicken,    
Boston Market, Blimpie, and Taco Bell from dropping iced tea from    
their menus.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This tempest in a teapot began back in the summer of 1994 when a    
restaurant customer in Cincinnati asked the local health department to    
test some tea with an "off" odor that had been served him at a    
restaurant.  The Cincinnati Health Department ran a fecal coliform    
test and then ran out to 20 other restaurants, rounded up their iced    
tea, and tested it all.  It found a modest level of fecal coliform    
bacteria.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Coliform in a water supply is a sign of possible harmful    
contamination, including the sometimes deadly bacteria E. coli, which    
caused the Jack in the Box deaths (from eating undercooked beef) three    
years ago.    
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
But tea isn't water;  it comes from a plant and the leaves of that    
plant are naturally exposed to fecal bacteria from droppings of birds    
and other animals.  Bacteria has always been in tea isn't a warning    
sign of anything.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nonetheless,  a year later the Health Department released the names of    
the restaurants to the Cincinnati Enquirer.  Since "enquiring minds    
want to know" the Enquirer ran a story titled "Iced Tea Worse than    
River," purportedly showing that "contamination is severe" in    
restaurant tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From Ohio the story spread to Kentucky, Georgia, and other states.     
Television station after station went out to local restaurants and    
brought back their iced tea for testing, and each reported in    
breathless horror that all or virtually all of the samples contained    
bacteria.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It apparently didn't occur or matter to them that if the tea were    
harmful there would have been a steady stream of sickened customers.     
In fact, deaths and illnesses of the iced tea epidemic continued to    
stand at zero.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Finally, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)    
felt compelled to act, issuing an advisory stating, "Tea is a beverage    
with little history of disease transmission," and "At present, no    
outbreaks of infection have been reported to CDC that were clearly    
associated with the consumption of tea."  No outbreaks ever, out of    
nearly 10,000 investigations of food-borne illness over the past    
decade.  The CDC did take the opportunity to provide appropriate    
directions on safely brewing tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But this didn't satisfy the Associated Press (AP), which labeled the    
advisory a "warning" and asserted it was based on tests indicating    
"high levels of fecal coliform bacteria, which can cause stomach upset    
and diarrhea."    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And still nobody had gotten sick from drinking tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

AP's report led to more than 140 news segments, almost all alarming.     
"Along with what makes your tea so tasty, you could be getting a    
strong dose of some nasty bacteria that could make you sick," a    
Miami/Ft. Lauderdale TV reporter warned. A Tampa/St. Petersburg    
station declared, "You might be drinking danger and not even know it."      
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A Los Angeles station consulted the expertise of the person on the    
street.  It quoted one iced tea drinker as being "shocked" while    
another said, "I think it's outrageous."    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Meanwhile CNN co-anchor Katherine Calloway punctuated a news segment    
by saying, "I don't think I'll ever order iced tea in a restaurant    
again."    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And still nobody had gotten sick from drinking tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Some stations interviewed "experts" until they found somebody to agree    
with them.  "If one [bacterium] is present, it's too much," a    
University of Texas School of Public professor told a Houston station.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And still nobody had gotten sick from drinking tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By February, the Wendy's chain had capitulated to the media-generated    
fear, suspending sales of the terrifying tea.  Perish the thought that    
the chain that pioneered a burger with three quarter-pound slabs of    
artery-choking, obesity-causing beef would sell its customers    
something that was bad for them.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

I went to a Wendy's last night.  Virtually every food served is    
guaranteed to push you towards a quadruple-bypass.  You can feel your    
arteries harden just scanning the menu.  They ought to have a team of    
paramedics with a heart resuscitator standing by for anyone who orders    
the Big Bacon Classic Combo.  But iced tea remains banned.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And still nobody has gotten sick from drinking tea.        
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Other fast-food chains are switching to individual bags of tea, which    
will contain the same bacteria but, hey, it's not safety but the    
appearance of safety that counts, right?    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

I only wish I owned lots of stock in a soda pop company right now.

<h2>

The Strangling Vines of Regulation   
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>

                
                       
     Even my most libertarian friends will admit to me in moments of weakness that there are
some government regulations they don't particularly mind.  My favorite is the one governing how
many rodent hairs or droppings can be in a jar of peanut butter.  And where would dumb sitcoms
be without a gag about the infamous prohibition against removing mattress tags?<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     The big problem with regulations is that they're the opposite of parties--more is definitely
not merrier.  And while somebody may or may not benefit from them, somebody always pays for
them.  Often enough, that somebody is all of us.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     That's the conclusion of two recently released papers from the Center for the Study of
American Business (CSAB) at Washington University in St. Louis.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     The first, by Ohio University economist Richard Vedder, finds that government
regulations cost the U.S. economy $1.3 trillion a year in lost productivity. To give you an idea of
how much that is, if you took 1.3 trillion dollar bills and stacked them on top of each other they'd
reach--well, awfully damned high.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     The second paper, by economist and CSAB Chairman Murray Weidenbaum, finds that the
companies that suffer most from regulation are medium-sized firms.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     Vedder notes in his report that regulation imposes direct costs, requiring businesses to
spend to put into effect government mandates.  But it's the indirect costs--in the form of reduced
productivity growth--that really clobber them.  Vedder says this means the economy only grows
at a rate of one percent per year, instead of the two percent it should.  If regulatory activity
remained at 1963 levels, the 1993 U.S. Gross Domestic Product would have been about $7.6
trillion.  Instead it was only $6.3 trillion.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     That means lost jobs, jobs that never get created, and lower wages.  It means a drag on
the stock market so that mutual fund you're counting on to support you in geezerhood won't be
nearly as big as it would otherwise.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     Vedder says environmental regulations make up the lion's share of the costs, but he hasn't
done a breakdown to see exactly how much it is.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     "I will concede there could be benefits," to some regulations, Vedder told me.  Maybe
from lots of regulations.  "But the problem is we've abandoned the principle of moderation. 
There's diminishing returns with regulations as with anything."
     For example, he says, "The first billion spent on particulate matter [a cause of air
pollution] probably eliminates a lot, but maybe the tenth or 20th or 50 billionth reduces the
pollution by very small amounts.  The cost-benefit ratio turns negative at some point.  I would
suggest those severely diminishing returns had already set in probably over a generation ago and
we've been paying the price ever since."<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     The point of Weidenbaum's study is that it's the nation's medium-sized businesses--not
the big multinationals like AT&T and IBM or the mom & pop operations that people are always
so concerned about--that bear the brunt of this regulatory onslaught.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     That's because the medium-sized firms fill out pretty much the same forms and meet the
same requirements as the big boys.  But the big boys have a lot more sales to show for their
troubles.  In fact, the costs of complying with regulations for companies with 20 to 499
employees averages over $5,000 per worker, says Weidenbaum, compared to just under $3,000
for companies with more than 500 employees.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     As for the little businesses, everybody feels sorry for them, so they have lots of
exemptions.  A lot of  regulations only affect companies with 50 or more people.
     But don't think these companies don't suffer, too.  What happens if they're at 49
employees--and there are probably one heck of a lot of companies with 49 employees--and just
need to expand by a couple more?  Generally speaking, they don't.  It's too much of a headache.
     The answer, as Weidenbaum stresses, is not to raise the level at which the regulations kick
in.  Make the cut-off  75 employees and you're going to find an awful lot of companies with 74.
     Rather we need to re-evaluate our regulatory system completely.  We should start with the
perverse system of incentives we give regulators.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     As it stands, if you're a environmental or health researcher and you don't discover a new
problem, you're probably not going to get your grant renewed.  So you make darned sure you
find a problem.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     Then the government regulator hears about the newly discovered problem.  He has to
implement a regulation to reduce or prevent it or he's probably not going to keep being able to
justify his job.    <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     That's how it's possible to end up spending billions more each year on regulations with no
discernible increase in benefit to safety, health, or even aesthetics.  We need to clean house.  We
must subject current as well as proposed regulations to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis, keeping in
mind that even beneficial regulations are a drag on the economy.  Just don't touch the one that
keep's Mickey Mouse's cousins out of my peanut butter.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<h2>
Media at Loss for Words Over AIDS Decline
   
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">

<P>

                
Ya know, it's getting so you can't trust anyone these days.  A few 
weeks ago, I was enthralled by the hit movie "Fargo," in part because 
its producers claimed that the tale of murder and mayhem in a small 
Minnesota town was based on a true story.  Only the names were 
changed, we were told, out of respect to the dead.  But there were no 
dead.  The movie was virtually a complete fabrication. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Maybe the movie's producers took their cues from the way the national 
media handles the news concerning AIDS.  Unlike "Fargo," there have 
been lots of deaths with AIDS. But as the latest yearly data just 
released from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) show, the epidemic that so recently was tagged as spiraling out 
of control is now fizzling. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Overall, AIDS cases were down seven percent last year, from 79,897 to 
74,180. Great news, right?  Try "no news"--at least to most of the big 
boys in the media. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
All three major TV network newscasts ignored the CDC's annual report, 
as did all three of the nation's major newsmagazines and most of the 
nation's major newspapers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Oh, sure, USA Today gave it a graphic comprising 69 words.  And the 
New York Times mentioned that new data existed, but only gave the 
numbers for New Jersey.  The Washington Post only gave it brief 
mention in an editorial. After all, we wouldn't want the nation's 
lawmakers to know that the disease they keep throwing more and more 
money at is on the decline, would we? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Contrast this with the coverage the media gave the epidemic in 1994, 
when cases greatly increased, albeit as the result of a statistical 
artifact resulting from the CDC expanding the definition of what 
constitutes an AIDS case.  Back then the New York Times's Lawrence 
Altman devoted a thousand words to the story, with the scary title 
"AIDS Cases Increase Among Heterosexuals."  Actually they "increased" 
among ALL groups, but what the hey? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And yes, both USA Today and the Washington Post wrote the story up two 
years ago, as did the Los Angeles Times and all the other big guys. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This is actually the second year in a row that AIDS cases have fallen, 
but it means a lot more this year.  That's because last year the data 
were still reflecting the shakeout from the new case definition.  The 
explosion of cases reported in 1994 led to a dearth in 1995.  But this 
year the decline is clearly real. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Even those reporters who did deign to mention that the largest 
epidemic of the century was starting to implode nonetheless managed to 
put a PC slant on it.  Thus, Karen Hill's story for the Associated 
Press (AP) was sent out over the wires as "AIDS Rate Down Nationwide, 
But More Blacks, Women Infected."  The body of the story also 
indicated that there  is a "spread" of the disease among women. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In actuality, 123 FEWER adult or adolescent women were reported to 
have contracted AIDS in 1995 than the year before.  It's nice to know 
that even if your child never learns to add or subtract, he can always 
get a job with the nation's largest wire service. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If AIDS really were spreading among women, it sure would be hard to 
explain how births to women infected with the AIDS virus dropped 
dramatically from 957 to 730.  Many states didn't have a single baby 
born with AIDS.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
How about that heterosexual "explosion" the media loves to talk about?  
Actually, there was a drop of 500 cases in that category.  Even AP 
didn't try to mess with that number; instead, like everybody else, 
they just ignored it. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
How about teenagers?  It wasn't long ago that the media were telling 
us that AIDS among teens would soon be more common than pimples.  But 
teen AIDS cases fell, too. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Indeed, in every way the AIDS epidemic has stubbornly refused to act 
like the media, the media's anointed "experts" and the government have 
said it would go.  It has steadfastly refused becoming a democratic 
disease, an "equal opportunity destroyer" as the nation's largest AIDS 
lobbying group once put it. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Instead, the disease is more and more one of the marginalized in our 
society.  Blacks are about 12 percent of the population, yet they now 
contribute as many victims to the epidemic as do whites.  Hispanics 
also are grossly over-represented.  Broken down by risk factor, the 
vast majority of cases continue to come from homosexual men and 
intravenous drug abusers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
White heterosexuals, the "risk group" on which the media harp 
incessantly, made up two percent of all AIDS cases last year.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
None of this should be in the least surprising.  I predicted it nine 
years ago in my first science article.  I did so not by slaughtering a 
chicken and reading its entrails, but simply by consulting the 
publicly available data and interviewing the real experts. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The media and the government ignored these data and those experts, 
instead fabricating an epidemic of white, middle-class heterosexuals 
with false headlines, misleading statistics, and celebrity victims.  
This led to the wasting of hundreds of millions of dollars fighting 
non-existent fires while the real ones have raged on.

<title>Fumento: FDA Screwing Around With Device Approval - 5/30/96</title>

<h2>
             FDA SCREWING AROUND WITH DEVICE APPROVAL
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>


Why is it that whenever the FDA quickly approves a drug or medical 
device, you always read about it in the first few pages of the 
newspaper, but when it delays approval of something that could prevent 
death and suffering, you usually only hear about it in the opinion 
pages--if at all? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Case in point: this column.  Subject: The FDA's delay in approving 
something called a pedicle screw to treat serious spinal injuries, a 
delay that is encouraging terrifically expensive litigation against 
the screws' manufacturers and making doctors hesitant to use them. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Originally pedicle screws were only used to fasten leg and arm bones, 
and the FDA approved them for this purpose.  But orthopedic surgeons 
found they were excellent for also fusing bones of the spine which had 
broken or degenerated.  There are other ways of doing this, such as 
wires, rods, or hooks, but once physicians tried the screws, the other 
techniques pretty much fell by the wayside. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The FDA has never approved the screws for this express purpose.  
Nonetheless, FDA policy wisely allows a drug or device which has 
proven safe and effective for one thing to be used for another.  It's 
called "off-label" use.  Virtually everybody reading this column has 
probably received a drug or treatment that hadn't been approved for 
that specific purpose, yet doctors had decided it was a good thing to 
offer their patients. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example the class of drugs that includes Tagamet, Pepcid, and 
Zantac was originally  approved only for clinically-verified duodenal 
ulcers.  But long before the FDA approved their wider use, doctors 
found they were helpful for many types of stomach disorder and 
prescribed them as such.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So it has been with pedicle screws used for spinal bone fusion.  Over 
300,000 times, doctors have used these on patients' back bones, in the 
belief that it was the best treatment.  But, of course, operations 
don't always accomplish their intended end; even the simplest.  I am 
now facing my third surgery to have a painful inflamed section of 
nerve removed from my foot.  Against all odds, the damned thing just 
keeps growing back--and believe me, being a freak of nature isn't all 
it's cracked up to be.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Just so, not all patients who have pedicle screws used on their back 
receive complete relief.  Sometimes it's the doctor's fault and 
sometimes that's just the way it is.  But in this litigation-happy 
country, nothing ever "just happens."  Somebody had to pay and pay 
dearly, and that's where the trial lawyers come in. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
About 7,000 patients who have received spinal treatment with pedicle 
screws have filed suits with an estimated total liability of $1 
billion.  Their lawyers' chief weapon: That the FDA has been steadily 
dragging its feet on the approval of the technique.  You can just hear 
the plaintiff's lawyer booming at the doctor on the witness stand: 
"You mean to tell us that you inserted these screws even though you 
knew for a fact that the FDA has not approved them for that purpose!" 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The best answer to that is: "Yeah, but so what?"  But you can see how 
an uninformed jury might feel otherwise.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
FDA approval of pedicle screws for use on the spine would "take the 
wind right out of the trial lawyers' sails," one industry insider told 
me. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Way back in 1994 an FDA panel of medical experts voted unanimously to 
ease regulations on the use of the screw.  And the 1995 FDA proposal 
itself says, "The data demonstrate that the use of pedicle screw-based 
instrumentation [on spinal degeneration and fractures] results in 
significantly higher rates when compared with treatment with no 
instrumentation or with currently available . . . devices." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Naturally, the trial lawyers are desperate to see the screws remain 
unapproved and have enlisted the lobbying and legal support of Sidney 
Wolfe's Public Citizen advocacy group, which often works hand-in-hand 
with plaintiffs' lawyers.  Yet not only is the FDA dragging its feet 
on granting approval (except for one extremely rare form of back 
surgery), one of its top officials has actually sabotaged the case for 
approval. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The sabotage arose out of something generally called the Cohort Study, 
a major evaluation published in the medical journal Spine which 
concluded that pedicle screws were at least as safe and more effective 
than previous methods of treatment.    
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As such, the study is devastating to the trial lawyers' position, 
prompting their typical reaction of trying to intimidate and harass 
the doctors who worked on the study.  The FDA knows about this tactic 
and so flatly told the lawyers it would not release the names.  But 
FDA Deputy Associate Commissioner Mitch Zeller  nonetheless turned the 
names over to a group associated with the trial lawyers.  He says he 
did so accidentally, not having noticed that they were marked as 
confidential.     
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Rep. Joseph Barton (D-TX), claims Zeller isn't telling the truth and 
is demanding that the Justice Department investigate.  In the 
meantime, subpoenas issued to doctors who worked on the Cohort Study 
have risen nearly five-fold since their names were released. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
FDA Commissioner David Kessler has apologized for the release, but has 
rushed to his employee's side in saying it was inadvertent.  Barton is 
right; that's a question for Janet Reno, not David Kessler to answer.  
In the meantime, the way for the FDA to undo some of the damage is to 
give its approval to pedicle screws for spinal use.  Get a backbone, 
commissioner, and do what's right.

<h3>EPA'S OWN PANEL SAYS IT<br> MASQUERADES DIOXIN POLICY AS SCIENCE</h3>  

By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center>
<hr> 
You probably don't remember when the EPA released its report on dioxin in September in the same way you remember, say, when JFK was shot or O.J. took his ride in the Ford Bronco. But the headlines might ring a bell:  "Dioxin Pollution Risks 'Worse than Feared,'" "Toxicity of Times Beach 'No Longer in Doubt,'" "Dioxin Scare is Real."<p>
Here's the catch.<p>
The EPA report was just a draft.  As in: "not the one that counts."  As such, it had yet to be evaluated by the agency's Scientific Advisory Board (SAB).  Now that board has rejected the conclusions that led to those scary headlines and sent the report back to the agency for a rewrite.<p>
Alas, no headlines this time. No, not a single major newspaper (or minor one that I'm aware of) ran a news story on the SAB decision, though Science magazine gave it a short write-up ("Panel Slams EPA's Dioxin Analysis") and there were a few editorials and op-eds.<p>
For 15 years now, the EPA has pursued a vendetta against dioxin, a by-product of paper bleaching, and of incineration of certain materials.  Until it was banned as such, it was also a by-product in the 
manufacturing of some herbicides, including the notorious Agent Orange.<p>
Ever since the chemical was found to be horribly toxic to guinea pigs -- albeit far less so to every other animal species tested, including other rodents -- the EPA and other environmental organizations have 
relentlessly attacked it as they have no other chemical save the pesticide DDT.<p>
Fear of dioxin contamination led to the evacuation of Love Canal and Times Beach, Missouri, and to telling Vietnam vets that they may be at extraordinary risk of disease.<p>
As a member of the class of chemicals called organochlorines, dioxin has become a cornerstone of Greenpeace's and other groups' efforts to ban all synthetic organochlorines -- a ban that would cripple the economy.<p>
The purpose of the EPA draft report was to show that this vendetta had been justified.  In addition to the old charge of dioxin being a possible human carcinogen -- causing as many as one in 1,000 human 
cancers -- the EPA added two newer charges: that it might affect human children in the womb and that it could compromise immune systems at levels approaching those to which Americans are currently exposed.<p>
While those human exposure levels are infinitesimal compared to our exposure to so many other chemicals, the EPA maintained that what causes illness in some animals at huge doses must also cause sickness in humans at tiny ones. Predictably it prompted such headlines such as "EPA:  Dioxin Exposure is Risky for People, Too."<p>
But several scientists at the meeting challenged the EPA's assumption, used in all its policy-making that there is no threshold below which a harmful chemical causes no harm. One was the University of Wisconsin's Alan Poland, widely known for his discovery of the "dioxin receptor," the molecule in cells to which dioxin must bind before it produces any affects.  He said 150 years of science contradicted the EPA no-threshold position.  Regarding dioxin, Poland said the normal level to which Americans are 
exposed -- four molecules of dioxin per cell -- is far below the number required to have an effect, considering that there are about 10,000 receptor molecules per cell.<p>
One EPA official complained to me that the board meeting had unfairly been characterized as negative. In fact, he said, the only problems the SAB found were with the ninth chapter. Of the first eight, it was highly complimentary.<p>
But that's just the point.  The first eight chapters were written by scientists outside of the EPA.  Only the last chapter, the conclusive one, the one from which EPA was to draw its regulatory policy and from 
which the media drew the headlines -- that was the one written by the EPA itself.
In that chapter, said Poland at the meeting, "policy masquerades as science."<p>
"This is probably the best data set that the EPA will see in my lifetime," Poland added.  "Yet, despite all of that, the first eight chapters are thrown away."<p>
Board members repeatedly accused the EPA of picking and choosing its data.  For example, the largest, most-heavily studied group of persons with known high exposure to dioxin were the members of Operation Ranch Hand, the men who did the actual spraying of Agent Orange on the jungles of South Vietnam. (Their motto: "Only you can prevent forests.") The EPA report duly noted any possible minor abnormality in this group.  But it neglected to say the Ranch Handers were strapping specimens of healthy humanity.<p>
"The EPA didn't mention that there were no more cancers than would be expected, no affects on the immune and nervous systems, no increase in deaths, and no increased birth defects in their children." SAB member and Office of Technology Assessment official Michael Gough told me.  "They mentioned nothing that didn't serve their purpose."<p>
One SAB member,  Dr. Knute Ringen of the Center to Protect Workers' Rights in Washington, D.C., concluded: "I think that the agency has pretty much come to the end of the line with regard to producing 
useful decision-making information on dioxin, and that it's time to go on to something else."<p>
But the EPA's dogged obsession with justifying its dioxin policy will not end -- unless, that is, Congress finally pulls the purse strings shut.<p>

<title>Disability Act</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Disability Act Cripples Small Businesses</h2> 
</center>
<hr>
<b>Michael Fumento</b>
<p>
<p>
A Harris poll shows that 90 percent of business executives surveyed support the enforcement provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Well, you know people who claim everything big business says is a lie?  This time they may be onto something. 
<p>
One wonders, for example, if the Coca-Cola company was polled.  Two  years ago, a Coca-Cola executive got drunk at a company party and  threatened a co-worker.  The company fired him and he sued, because  under the ADA alcoholism is a disability.  Coca-Cola claimed they didn't fire him over the "disability," but over the threatening  
behavior--there being as yet no federal protection for such people.  A  jury disagreed and handed our soft drink sot over $1 million in lost wages and $6 million in punitive damages.  He won't get it all, since the ADA limits punitive damages to $300,000 for big businesses, but it wasn't for want of trying.  
<p>
And how about Exxon, which--after a certain accident off the coast of  
Alaska--began cracking down on employees in dangerous jobs who imbibe.   
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which oversees  
enforcement of the ADA, is suing them for it. 
<p>
Yes, under the ADA, behavior which society used to condemn can now be handsomely rewarded.  
<p>
Under the ADA, which took effect in 1992, businesses with 15 or more employees are forbidden from discriminating in hiring, firing, or promotions on the basis of a disability.  In addition, businesses catering to the public such as theaters, stores, and restaurants must  make their facilities highly accessible to disabled persons in terms of getting in, using the bathroom, and getting around. 
<p>
No one yet knows how wide the definition of "disabled" will end up. It certainly is wide enough to include the obese.  But to qualify you have to be really, really fat.  If you just have a pot belly or thunder thighs you've got a lot of hard eating in front of you. 
 
Traditional disabilities are far outnumbered by this new breed.  According to the National Organization on Disability, which commissioned the business poll, there are 49 million disabled  Americans at any one time.  (And naturally it represents the wishes of  all of them.)  Of these, fewer than 2 percent are in wheelchairs. 
<p>
Of complaints filed under the ADA, as of the end of March only 7.3% had anything to do with disabilities of the extremities such as paralysis or missing limbs.  Blindness and deafness accounted for 6  percent of complaints.  Back pain, conversely, made up almost a fifth  of all cases while emotional and psychiatric impairments were 11.6  
percent. 
<p>
So much for the imagery of the Vietnam vet in a wheelchair. 
<p>
No, under the ADA, we may not all get our 15 minutes of fame, but by  golly we all get a grab at the brass ring of disability. Still, big business has learned to stop worrying and love the ADA, says the poll. 
<p>
Don't believe it.  People often tell pollsters what they think they should say rather than what they really believe.  That's why polls showed California's anti-illegal immigration Proposition 187 headed for certain defeat just days before it easily passed.  
<p>
Yet at least those were anonymous polls.  There was nothing anonymous here.  Guarantees of confidentiality notwithstanding, no CEO in his right mind would want to be listed somewhere as disapproving of an act which everybody thinks is supposed to help Stevie Wonder and Jerry's Kids. 
<p>
Had Harris polled small businesses, the response might have been more
straightforward. That's because a single lawsuit can hurt a small business so much more. 
<p>
True, under the ADA businesses with fewer than 50 employees can lose no more than $50,000 in punitive damages.  But, "the typical small business owner takes home less than $40,000 a year, so basically it means the business, the house, the car, and then some," explains Wendy Lechner of the National Federation of Independent Businesses. 
<p>
Moreover, Lechner told me, "The  litigation can cost more than the damages [settlement or award] and that is what frightens" small  businesses. For a company like Coca Cola a few hundred thousand  dollars in litigation costs doesn't amount to cola beans.  For Charlie  Chan's Chinese takeout, it means their goose could be cooked even if they win. 
<p>
The public access section of the ADA also slams small businesses particularly hard.  An article in the current issue of Reason magazine by Brian Doherty details the nightmare odyssey of a Denver restaurant owner who ended up needlessly paying over $100,000 in construction costs and fees to make his business comply.  
<p>
Fines aside, small business owners are terrified of bad publicity.  Lechner spoke of a  Tennessee woman who rented space for her business in a local mall.  A local activist group demanded she make her store more accessible to wheelchairs and she agreed but added that by contract she needed to wait until the mall owner arrived back in the country.  Not good enough.  Soon the story of this heartless
businesswoman was everywhere. "She feels she may not recover for years  because 
it was all over the papers," says Lechner. 
<p>
If our congressional representatives were to conduct an informal poll  of some of their own small-business owning constituents, they'd  probably hear something a lot different than what millionaire chief  executives told the Harris people.  They'd probably hear that the ADA needs to be scrapped--or at least severely disabled.

<title>Fumento: The Media's Militia Hate-Fest -- 8/8/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 8, 1996</i><br>
<h2>The Media's Militia Hate-Fest</h2>
You've got to hand it to those braniacs in the media. Almost before 
the blast of the Olympic bombing stopped ringing in our hears, they 
knew whodunnit. Actually, it was a simple deduction for them.  The 
person who phoned in the warning had an American, white-sounding 
voice; therefore it was (ominous music, please) THE MILITIA! <p>

Now, now, don't pay any attention to the talk about this loner 
security guard with the hero complex.  The media had its men long ago. <p>

Here's how the Associated Press (AP) began a story. "The bomber who 
brought terror to the Olympics was a white male, may not have worked 
alone and may have shared militia groups' hatred of international 
organizations." <p>

Of course, this means he just as easily could have worked alone and 
despised militia groups almost as much as, say, the media do. But 
that's not the way AP wanted to slant it. <p>

Then there was the headline: "Two Militia Members Potential Suspects 
in Olympics Blast." <p>

"Potential" here serves the same purpose as "may" in the AP story. It 
takes nothing and makes it seem like something. Heck, as an American 
male with a white-sounding voice  (not to mention one who was trained 
to blow things up in the Army) I could have been a potential suspect.  
(I hope I don't get a call from the FBI now.) <p>

When I did a search of the Nexis computer data base of newspapers, 
magazines, and TV news shows and plugged in the key words "militia," 
"Olympic," and "bomb," I found no fewer than 343 articles containing 
those terms! <p>

Granted, a couple of those pieces actually said there was no reason to 
suspect the militia.  But most of the rest bent over backwards, 
sideways, and at any odd angle to try to tie these things together. <p>

Why? <p>

"With the Oklahoma City bombing, there were 36 hours in which it was 
Middle Eastern terrorists," David Kopel, research director of the 
Independence Institute in Golden, Colorado reminded me. "It's the same 
human instinct to rush to judgment against whoever is the modern hate 
object." <p>

Says Kopel, "A lot of what the media thrives on is conflicts of good 
versus evil.  What they put into the `evil' box varies with sociology 
of the times.  In the 1910s it would have been anarchists; in the 
1930s it would have been sex-crazed Negroes on marijuana.  Now it's 
the tobacco industry and gun owners." <p>

So part of the reason the media hate the militia is because they have 
guns.  (God help them if they also smoke.)  But certainly another 
factor is the media fear what they don't understand.  Since they are 
so enamored of big government, they can't possibly comprehend the 
thinking of people so very mistrustful of big government.  Indeed, 
it's safe to say that many militia members are downright paranoid, but 
that's hardly illegal and hardly a characteristic of only militia 
groups. <p>

Further, both the media and the public have a misconception of the 
militia because the only time you hear of them, they've done something 
wrong, be it stockpiling illegal weapons or refusing to pay taxes. 
But, says Kopel, focusing on criminals on the fringe of the militia 
movement, "Is no more fair than saying that the cops who beat up 
Rodney King are representative of police throughout the country." <p>

Finally, the pot is being stirred by groups which make their living by 
making you think all militia members are white boys who wear pointed 
white hoods or greet each other with "Heil Hitler!" instead of 
"Hello!" (Never mind that the leader of one of the largest militia 
units, J.J. Johnson of Ohio, is black and that he's called the media 
attempts to identify the militia with racism as "drive-by 
journalism.") <p>

One such group is the Center for Democratic Renewal (CDR), which as I 
documented in a July 8 Wall Street Journal article basically 
fabricated the "epidemic" of black church burnings.  Depending on the 
gullibility of the reporter, the CDR will say there are anywhere from 
50,000 to 200,000 militia members and allies, though a 1995 Anti-
Defamation League report put the figure at 15,000. <p>

Another militia-baiting group is the Southern Poverty Law Center, 
headed by Morris Dees.  The Atlanta bombing, he suggested to wide-eyed 
reporters, might be a militia effort to "disrupt the one-world 
movement." <p>

It probably never occurred to most of us, militia included, that the 
modern Olympic games--now a century old--were part of any one-world 
movement, instead of a forum for athletes to glorify their countries 
and earn fat endorsement contracts. <p>

 But Dees profits handsomely from spreading hysteria. According to an 
August 3 USA Today story, his group has now amassed a fortune of $68 
million, even while other civil rights groups are going broke. <p>

"Morris Dees is an effective, demagogic hatemonger who's using his 
immense talents to get rich by making Americans afraid of each other," 
says Kopel. "He's a fraud who has milked a lot of very wonderful, 
well-intentioned people," Stephen Bright of Atlanta's Southern Center 
for Human Rights told USA Today. <p>

Says Kopel, "If the militia hadn't come along, Dees and the CDR would 
have had to invent them, and they have indeed invented what they mean 
to a lot of people." <p>

That includes virtually the entire U.S. media. Now if they can only 
find a way to blame the downing of TWA Flight 800 on a small band of 
militia in Idaho . . .  <p>

<title>ANTI-OBESITY DRUG IS HEAVY ON HYPE</title>
</head>
<hr>

<h2>ANTI-OBESITY DRUG IS HEAVY ON HYPE</h2>


By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p>
It seems that when it comes to weight-loss products, the expression 
"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is" just doesn't have 
meaning.  So it has been with the so-called "miracle anti-fat pill," 
which isn't a pill, isn't a miracle, and has "hype" written all over 
it.
<p>
Recent studies in Science magazine have claimed synthesized high doses 
of a naturally-occurring hormone, called leptin, caused mice to go 
from Jackie Gleason to Art Carney in a matter of weeks. This has 
sparked a celebration in various media outlets.  The St. Petersburg 
(Florida) Times, the most-read newspaper in one of the fattest parts 
of the country, gushed, "Just think: You could gorge yourself on ice 
cream, potato chips, tacos . . . . Then just pop a miracle pill, and 
your worries are over . . . . The world would be couch-potato heaven."  
<p>
Ah . . .  Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow there's a drug, 
right?
<p>
Reality check.
<p>
The first little problem with leptin is that the "pill" is actually 
injections, possibly daily, for life.
<p>
No big deal?  Ask any insulin-dependent diabetic.  The difference 
between leanness and simple obesity (obesity is usually defined as 
being 20% over ideal weight) is about the equivalent of a McDonald's 
Big Mac.  Probably few of us would cherish trading sandwiches for 
shots.
<p>
Then there's the efficacy issue. Leptin works wonders on rotund 
rodents and no doubt Mickey will soon have heard the last of Minnie's 
teasing about his "beer cheese belly." But mice are not small men.  
Medical literature is replete with instances of drugs that cured or 
killed rodents yet had no effect on humans.
<p>
Recent research by Dr. Jos‚ Caro and others at Thomas Jefferson 
Medical Center in Philadelphia, including a study in the June Journal 
of Clinical Investigation, has found that obese people actually 
already have far higher levels of leptin than do lean ones.  This 
could mean that leptin is useless as a weight regulator in humans.  
Or, as Dr. Caro told me, the situation could be like Type II diabetes, 
in which sufferers have high levels of insulin but are resistant to 
its effects and therefore must be given much more insulin.
<p>
Maybe a massive dose of leptin would work on obese humans, says Dr. 
Caro. "But that is an optimistic view. It may also not work."    
<p>
Then there's safety.  We don't know yet how safe large leptin 
infusions are for mice, much less humans.
<p>
What all this means is that the two-year timeline some reporters have 
suggested for general use of the drug is laughable.  Five is more like 
it, and perhaps far more.  
<p>
Assuming leptin even worked perfectly, there would still be the 
problem that obesity is often just the most obvious indicator of the 
physical harm on ourselves by overeating and underexercising.  Leptin 
won't strengthen the lungs, heart, and other muscles grown soft 
through too many hours of watching Home Improvement and Roseanne.  It 
won't lower cholesterol levels. It won't prevent colon cancer and 
other malignancies linked to a bad diet.
<p>
And then there's another kind of harm for which obesity is merely a 
marker, the mental attitude that's led to the obesity epidemic.
<p>
Despite the other obesity hype we've been hearing lately, that of "fat 
genes," genes cannot explain the waistline explosion of the last two 
decades that has made a third of us obese and as many as three-fourths 
of us overweight.  Genes cannot explain why Americans of European 
descent weigh so much more than do Europeans, making the land of the 
free also the land of the fattest people on earth.
<p>
Yes, there is evidence that some human obesity is genetic, and if some 
300 pounder insists he sustains his weight on a turnip a day, I won't 
argue.  But most fat people are only lying to themselves when they 
blame their ancestors.
<p>
One better object of blame is a culture that encourages overeating and 
underexertion. Another is ourselves.
<p>
It used to be that concepts like "self-restraint," "delayed 
gratification," "self-denial" and "all things in moderation" were 
indicative of building character.  Now they have become quaint.
<p>
Tell an overweight American he should eat less and exert himself more 
and you're likely to get the same incredulous response you'd get if 
you told a welfare mother with seven children by six men that human 
beings should not behave like rabbits.
<p>
Gluttony isn't called one of the seven deadly sins because it can 
spoil your looks in a bikini, but rather because of its impact on the 
spirit.  But Americans don't want to hear about that sin or any other.
<p>
Instead, we want to indulge, and we don't want to bulge.  So we spend 
billions of dollars a year chasing after fad diets, false prophets, 
anti-cellulite salves, pills, foods, drinks, and exercise equipment 
guaranteed to effortlessly burn off gazillions of calories. We buy 
books and videos from screaming women with blonde crewcuts, and 
purchase cream promising to magically drain the fat from our thighs.
<p>
 Sure, no miracle cure has worked yet, but the next one just might. 
Anything's better than a little self-discipline, a little denial.  And 
who knows, maybe the next promised miracle will really pan out.  Maybe 
leptin will.
<p>
Yes, some day we may all be able to walk around in a glorious leptin 
lethargy with feedbags on one end and bags like they sling under 
parade horses on the other end.  
<p>
But alas, what truly ails this nation no drug is going to cure.

<title>GULF WAR SYNDROME: SON OF AGENT ORANGE</title>
</head>

<hr><center><h2>Gulf War Syndrome:  Son of Agent Orange</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<center>By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento </a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p> 
Yet another scientific study has found no evidence that Gulf War 
Syndrome (GWS) is anything other than a broad tag applied to any 
illness found in any Gulf Vet. But those who deny the evidence remain 
undaunted. After all, says Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown, it 
took 20 years for the government to conclude that Agent Orange, a 
defoliant used on the jungles of South Vietnam, caused severe health 
problems in vets. Now the government liberally doles out payments to 
Vietnam vets with any number of diseases it claims have been linked to 
Agent Orange.
<p>
Indeed, the cry of "It's Agent Orange all over again!" has become the 
"Remember the Maine!" slogan of the GWS alarmists.  And they're right, 
but not in the way they would have us believe.
<p>
Both then and now there were wild, unsubstantiated tales of exposure.  
With Agent Orange, soldiers complained of being drenched with an 
orange-colored powder or liquid from the sky.  But the name comes from 
the color of the containing barrels. Agent Orange is clear and always 
a liquid. With GWS we hear of soldiers absolutely convinced they were 
hit by poison gas, even though during the whole of the war not one was 
ever treated for such exposure.  
<p>
Then and now there were wild rumors of miscarriage and birth defects 
among offspring of vets.  One case we keep hearing about is an alleged 
cluster of birth defects among National Guard families in Mississippi.  
But a health department investigation showed no more birth defects in 
that group than normal.  Wider studies have shown the same thing for 
both the offspring of Vietnam and Gulf War vets.  No study has ever 
shown them to have more birth defects or more miscarriages than vets 
who didn't go to war.
<p>
Then and now any symptom any vet got was blamed on the alleged 
illness. More than 75 symptoms have been attributed to GWS, ranging 
from bleeding gums to aching joints to graying hair to weight gain to 
heart disease. Even malaria and herpes have been attributed to GWS, 
though previously these were thought to have been spread by mosquitoes 
and sex.  If you have chronic back pains and didn't go to the Gulf, 
it's just chronic back pain. If you went, it's Gulf War Syndrome.
<p>
Then and now vets who got cancer automatically blamed it on the 
offending agent, as if vets who serve in wars are never supposed to 
get the disease. But one out of four Americans will eventually 
contract cancer.  Studies on Vietnam vets showed that they had no more 
cancers than among vets who didn't go to war, and the same has held 
true of Gulf War vets.
<p>
An on-going study of military personnel who actually did the Agent 
Orange spraying and who received far greater exposure than did ground 
troops indicates they are just as healthy as counterparts who received 
no Agent Orange exposure.
<p>
The same is true of studies of Gulf vets. The only illnesses they have 
to a greater degree than soldiers who didn't go to the Gulf are 
psychologically-related. These may be very real and debilitating, but 
they weren't caused by anything in the Gulf itself.  The prime cause, 
ironically, is probably being told they are being ravaged by a mystery 
illness.  Doctors have long known that if you tell people they are 
ill, they'll start sprouting numerous symptoms completely unrelated to 
their actual illness.
<p>
Then and now no purported link between illness and the alleged cause 
is considered too ludicrous. The first famous Agent Orange victim, 
Paul Reutersham, who died of cancer, was by his own admission 
completely enclosed in a supply helicopter at the time the area he was 
in was being sprayed.
<p>
The most reported-on death from GWS is Michael Adcock.  His mother 
claims a gas-laden Scud missile had exploded nearby 24 hours before 
her son developed his first cancer symptom. But cancers such as his 
usually take decades to develop and no cancer manifests itself in 
anything near 24 hours.
<p>
Then and now  the hysteria was driven by veterans lobbyists (most 
prominently the American Legion), by congressmen who opposed the war 
in question and who leap at any excuse to spend other people's money 
to show their compassion, by a media far more interested in selling 
terror than telling the truth, and (of course) lawyers.
<p>
Then and now, science was openly disavowed. In 1990, a veterans 
lobbyist said of Agent Orange, "we must now presume that the 
scientific community cannot be trusted [and] a political decision must 
be made on this issue to provide compensation to veterans."  In 1995 
President Clinton  leapfrogged over the heads of scientists in 
establishing a political panel to review GWS evidence, with Hillary 
Clinton serving as the Administration's point person on the issue.
<p>
Then and now, to question the causation-disease link was to be accused 
of being heartless and unpatriotic, as if it is compassionate and 
patriotic to mislead healthy people into believing they--and their 
wives and children--live under the shadow of a terrible disease.
<p>
Yes, then and now, vets have truly suffered, but not from any exposure 
they received during wartime. Rather it is exposure to those who claim 
to be their friends and allies that has caused their terror and even 
some of their symptoms.  With friends like those, who needs Ho Chi 
Minh and Saddam Hussein?

<title>Direct Lending Clunker is Already Running out of Gas</title>

<center><h2>Direct Lending Clunker is Already Running out of Gas</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<center>By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p> 
Picture a car salesman screaming at you from the television.  "My plan 
will save you billions, BILLIONS, in tax dollars by taking student 
loans away from the banks and cutting out the middleman's profits! But 
there's more! Students will save money, too, because I'm offering them 
lo-lo E-Z payments! I must be crazy to offer such a deal!  That's why 
they call me Crazy Billy!"
<p>
That, if you pardon a wee bit of rhetorical flourish, was President 
Bill Clinton of two years ago. And his pitch worked, as Congress 
enacted his student loan direct lending program.
<p>
And as is so often the case, the vehicle that on the lot looked so 
pretty has turned out to be little more than a bucket of bolts.
<p>
The timing on the direct loan scheme couldn't have been more ironic. 
At a time when former Soviet republics were privatizing everything in 
sight, our government was nationalizing a major industry. Still, two 
government studies, one by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and 
the other by the General Accounting Office, did calculate that direct 
lending could save money, about $4 billion over the next four years.  
The Clinton Administration made things look sweeter by arbitrarily 
doubling that to $8 billion.  What's a measly $4 billion among 
friends, right?
<p>
A pilot direct-loan program was already in the works, but in the 
atmosphere of arrogance that characterized those early Clinton months, 
the Administration decided there was no need to wait.
<p>
Now even government agencies are saying that this act of reinventing 
government is closer to reinventing the Edsel.
<p>
A new CBO study has actually reversed that agency's position and 
concluded that the best way for government to save money with direct 
lending is to scrap it.  This could save taxpayers $1.5 billion over 
the next seven years.
<p>
The reason for CBO's about face is that its original report compared 
the administrative costs of only a year of the direct lending scheme 
with the full administrative costs of the guaranteed student loan 
system.  When Congress directed the CBO to compare both programs on an 
equal footing, it became clear the result was a jump in government 
spending.
<p>
A new Congressional Research Service report also concludes that the 
Administration was not calculating fully the cost of taking over the 
administration of the program.
<p>
Also a fraud is the part of Crazy Billy's plan which was to help 
students, the E-Z payment part. All it actually does is to stretch out 
payments, the oldest trick in the car salesman's repertoire.  
Currently, students are given 10 years to repay, while under direct 
lending it's 25.  Sure, payments are lower.  But at the end of the 25-
year period a student borrowing the maximum amount allowed, $88,000, 
would end up paying back $167,723 in interest and principle instead of 
$128,400 under the existing plan.
<p>
Moreover you would also have students paying off  their college loans 
even as their own children were going off to college. Instead of a 
chicken in every pot, Clinton's promise is two generations of student 
loans in every family.
<p>
But there's one huge difference between Crazy Billy and other used car 
salesmen.  No one forces you to buy from a used car lot.
<p>
Crazy Billy says he won't force anyone to buy his plan, either.   
Repeatedly he's stated that direct government lending will be a matter 
of choice for schools.  As late as April of this year he spoke of 
making "the student loan program available to all the schools on a 
voluntary basis . . . "
<p>
Yet Clinton's current budget proposal indicates that all colleges and 
universities will be in the program by 1997-98.  Education Secretary 
William Riley has affirmed in a letter to Tennessee Democratic 
Representative Bart Gordon, a direct lending opponent, that under the 
presidents's plan, by the 1997-98 school year "all schools would be 
required to participate."
<p>
So much for "voluntary."
<p>
The obvious reason for this conscription is the same as for any--that 
volunteerism isn't working.  While the law allows up to 40% of loan 
volume by 1995-96, recent reports from the GAO and the Advisory 
Committee on Student Financial Assistance state that direct lending 
participation will actually be around 30%.  Far from flocking to join 
the program, institutions have been scrambling to get out.  Earlier 
this year the GAO stated that 104 institutions have abandoned their 
Crazy Billy direct lending vehicle by the side of the road. 
<p>
Yet while legitimate four- and two-year institutions have been 
steering clear of the government program, it has become a haven for 
hundreds of high-default trade schools with questionable credentials.  
Almost half the direct loans are to students of trade schools, with a 
third of all loans going to students of barber or beauty academies.  
The default rate for student loans from trade schools averages 30%, 
compared with only 7% for four-year colleges.  For all his trouble in 
taking over the student loan program, Uncle Sam is going to get stuck 
holding a lot of useless notes.
<p>
A recent poll sponsored by direct lending opponents indicates that 
almost three-fourths of the public believes that the pre-Clinton 
system of private industry making loans which the government 
guarantees is better than the Clinton program. Congress should tell 
Crazy Billy that taxpayers aren't the tire-kicking yahoos he thinks we 
are and that we want direct lending sent to the junk yard.

<title>FARM SUBSIDIES SUBSIDIZE WETLANDS DESTRUCTION</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<hr>
<center>
<h2>Farm Subsidies Subsidize Wetlands Destruction</h2><br>
By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Pesticides, those much maligned chemicals, can be wonderful things. 
Likewise for fertilizer, when it's not being used to blow up federal 
buildings.  They are both important tools in making the U.S. the best-
fed nation in the world, and in feeding tens of millions of citizens 
of other nations.<p>
But, as they say, you can have too much of a good thing. Agricultural 
run-off from these products are the biggest cause of waterway 
pollution in this country. Pesticides, which are primarily herbicides, 
can kill plants downstream.  Fertilizer run-off makes other plants 
grow at extraordinary rates. Together, fertilizers and pesticides can 
be a one-two punch against eco-systems.<p>
The single best example of such destruction is the nation's largest 
wetlands, the Everglades. Phosphorous fertilizer run-off from sugar 
cane has set off  a chain reaction, stimulating growth among bacteria 
and algae and alsofosters the growth of cattails which choke off the 
marshes, ruining nesting places and destroying animal food supplies. 
Thousands of acres have been overrun by these super cattails.<p>   
Because of such problems, pesticides and fertilizers are heavily 
targeted by government regulators. And it's seems only right that the 
government be involved because, you see, it's the government that's 
responsible for much of the problem.<p>
That's the conclusion of a new study from the Competitive Enterprise 
Institute (CEI) in Washington, D.C. <p>
The study analyzed data from six major farms states, and found that 
eliminating farm subsidies could reduce chemical use per acre by as 
much as 35%.<p>
This is because under the federal price support program, which applies 
to many types of crops, the government pays the farmer a guaranteed 
price for his yield. If, come harvest time, the crops don't bring in 
that minimum price the government pays the farmer the difference, 
called a deficiency payment.<p>
Naturally, this short-circuits the market. Farmers grow extra crops 
not because there are waiting mouths out there but because the 
government is paying a bounty. Extra crops require extra pesticides 
and fertilizer.<p>
But it gets worse. In order to try to limit these extra crops, the 
government encourages farmers--through additional payments--to keep 
part of their land idle. But farmers are terrific businessmen, and a 
heck of a lot smarter than your average bureaucrat. So the farmer goes 
to extraordinary lengths to get as many crops as he can out of the 
acreage still in use. This includes pouring on all the more fertilizer 
and pesticides.<p>
U.S. consumption of plant fertilizer is now close to an all-time high, 
while pesticide use per acre is at its highest point ever.<p>
Now we have too much fertilizer and pesticide in use and too much 
food. This surplus food practically guarantees that commodity prices 
will be low again next year and the cycle starts all over again. It's 
so ridiculous you'd think it was directed by Kevin Costner, except 
that this overblown budget is on a government scale. That puts farm 
subsidy prices at about $10 billion per year.<p>
Myself, I have better uses for my tax dollars than destroying precious 
wetlands. I also didn't give up the benefit of phosphorous detergent 
just to subsidize its use by farmers, who were always the greatest 
source of phosphorous pollution in any case.<p>
In the case of the Everglades, no deficiency payments are made. So the 
sugar lobby wants you to think it's not costing you anything. But 
instead of direct payments, the government has established a quota-
based tariff on sugar imports. In all, the sugar program is estimated 
to cost consumers $1.4 billion a year and, again, encourages excess 
crop growing.<p>
But if you, me, and the alligators and egrets don't care much for this 
whole business, you won't hear the bureaucrats complaining. Indeed, 
this is a jobs program for them.<p>
As study author Jonathon Tolman put it to me, "On one hand you have 
EPA doing everything it can to reduce pesticide use by any means 
possible, costing taxpayers a fortune.  And on the other hand you have 
the USDA using taxpayer money to get more of it." It's bizarre, which 
is to say business as usual for the feds.<p>
While CEI is often at odds with environmentalists, on this they have 
the full backing of the Wilderness Society.  "We think [the study] is 
indisputable," General Counsel Jim Webb told me. The nation is 
"investing a lot of national capital, in both dollars and critters, in 
keeping this subsidy going." <p>
Any one study needs to be seen as just that--one study. But other 
studies support  Tolman's findings.  One conducted on the North 
Carolina coastal plain, for example, found that elimination of farm 
programs would have reduced nitrogen leaching from fertilizer use by 
46%. And data from the 1991 and 1992 Cropping Practices Surveys shows 
that corn producers who participated in the USDA feedgrain program 
used nitrogen, herbicides and insecticides at greater rates than those 
who didn't participate.<p>
There is relief from all this in the former of legislation introduced 
by Democratic Rep. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Republican Rep. Dick 
Zimmer (N.J.) that would phase out most deficiency payments over the 
next six years (giving farmers a chance to adjust) and make other 
major cuts in federal farm subsidies. Other legislation before 
Congress would begin removing those sweet special privileges the sugar 
lobby receives.<p>
If alligators and egrets could lobby their congressmen--and why not, 
if dead people in Chicago can vote?--they'd surely be lobbying to get 
rid of farm supports.<p>

<h2>TIME TO MAKE AMERICORPS A CORPSE</h2><p>
By<br> <A href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Back in 1993 it was called "the best of Bill Clinton" and something 
"no one can quarrel with" except possibly to argue that "the whole 
thing isn't big enough." But a just-released Government Accounting 
Office report indicates that it is nonetheless big enough to be a fine 
example of Clintonesque waste in a time when far worthier programs are 
facing the budget-cutter's axe.<p>
"It" was the Clinton administration's proposed national service 
program, later dubbed "AmeriCorps," under which a person would 
received a stipend and a $4,725 college educational voucher for 
providing civilian national service.<p>
As part of an allegedly austere budget, Clinton wanted to spend $7.4 
billion on AmeriCorps over five years.  Congress gave its approval but 
scaled the program back to $1.5 billion for a three-year program.<p>
Now the Republican-dominated House has voted to cut off funding for 
the program as of October 1, with the Senate set to consider that 
proposal shortly.<p>
 Some criticism of AmeriCorps is unfair, such as making fun of their 
tag as "volunteers" because they are paid. Our "all-volunteer Army" is 
paid, as are members of the Peace Corps and other programs generally 
considered volunteer. Clearly the AmeriCorps members are volunteers in 
that they weren't forced into the program, as would have been if a 
number of both conservative and liberal pundits had had their way.<p>
Further, while the average stipend plus benefits value per hour, at a 
bit less than $7.50, is well above minimum wage,  no youth is going to 
get rich working for AmeriCorps.<p>
Yet, as is so often the case when the government is involved, much of 
the money allotted to the program somehow seems to be slipping through 
the cracks and crevices.<p>
The GAO report found that AmeriCorps cost $26,654 per participant. 
While AmeriCorps claims its overhead is only 5% of its budget, the GAO 
report shows that over half the average expense per member goes to 
something other than pay and benefits.<p>
In a July, 1994 letter to AmeriCorps critic Charles Grassley (Rep.-
Iowa),  Eli J. Segal, head of the Corporation for National Service, 
the parent organization of AmeriCorps, said that "the federal share 
[of the cost of supporting an AmeriCorps participant] should not 
exceed $13,000 on average."  In fact, the federal share was $20,806.  <p>
The more the federal involvement, the higher the cost.  For non-
federal agencies receiving AmeriCorps grants, the funding average was 
$25,797 while for federal ones it was $31,017.<p>
While 15% of AmeriCorp's budget was to come from private 
contributions, so far less than 7% does--though Eli  insists that with 
time that figure will improve.<p>
In a country in which 80 million people claim to be doing at least 
some part-time volunteer work (though of course there is always a need 
for more), are 20,000 more volunteers a year at $26,654 a head really 
worth it?  According to many pundits and editorialists, they are.<p>
To read some accounts of AmeriCorps, one wonders how the country could 
have survived over two centuries without it. There they are, combating 
inner-city drug abuse and crime, cleaning up beaches, fighting global 
climate change. So heralded are they in the media that when Tennessee  
AmeriCorps members decided to work on Martin Luther King day it made 
the pages of the Memphis Commercial Appeal. Such incredible dedication 
obviously deserves recognition.<p>
Some of the projects have been of dubious value. The San Francisco 
Chronicle profiled one participant who earned her pay and benefits by 
providing AIDS education to deaf homosexuals.  Apparently 14 years 
after the AIDS epidemic began, deaf San Francisco homosexuals remain 
ignorant of how the disease is spread.<p>
Other projects are more dubious yet. In Denver, AmeriCorps members 
earned their pay by handing out leaflets attacking a city councilman.<p>
But political activism is not so much the problem as plain old waste. 
A federal report on the Orange County, California AmeriCorps branch 
revealed that while the program was supposed to provide service 
programs for more than 1500 people in Orange County, none of the 
programs in the four participating cities ever had more than 25 
participants, with most ranging from five to 15.  Other Orange County 
AmeriCorps projects, such as knitting a memorial quilt for survivors 
of the Oklahoma City bombing, have a real air of make-work about them. 
By the way, the quilt was never finished.<p>
But the Orange County program is just one bad apple out of a big 
national barrel right? Actually, the federal evaluation report stated, 
"Overall, this is a good AmeriCorps program."  One shudders to think 
what a bad program is like. <p>
Clinton likens AmeriCorps to such projects as President Franklin 
Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and President Kennedy's 
Peace Corps. Indeed, in his State of the Union address last January, 
Clinton accidentally referred to AmeriCorps as "the Peace Corps."<p>
But both these programs had clearly defined goals.  The CCC planted 
trees, fought forest fires, dug drainage ditches. The Peace Corps 
brought medical care, sanitation, and new agricultural techniques to 
underdeveloped parts of the world.<p>
AmeriCorps's charge, on the other hand, is an amorphous "Go out there 
and do some good!"  Such a vague, feel-good, approach, some might say, 
is a nice metaphor for the Clinton administration in general.<p>

<title>NY Times Blows Hot Air Over Global Warming</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<hr><center><h2>NEW YORK TIMES BLOWS <br>HOT AIR OVER GLOBAL WARMING </h2>By Michael Fumento 
</center><hr><p> 

If you're like me, about twice a month you get a fat yellow envelope 
from this guy named  Ed McMahon, saying "YOU, JOHN DOE could already 
be the winner" of 9 million dollars or some such. If you're like me 
you toss the envelope away, realizing that here the difference between 
"could" and "are" is vast and virtually insurmountable.<p>

So, it is too, in the world of environmental doomsaying, which leads 
us to the subject of the New York Times front-page article by William 
K. Stevens: "Scientists Say Earth's Warming Could Set Off  Wide 
Disruptions." In that same edition a Times editorial decried possible 
congressional cuts in funding for global warming research.<p>

This article was intended as the knock-out blow, with the setup left 
jab having come a week earlier in the form of another Steven's front-
page article "Experts Confirm Human Role in Global Warming."  There 
Stevens began with a reference to a draft report by the U.N. 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). "In an important 
shift of scientific judgment," he wrote, "experts advising the world's 
governments on climate change are saying for the first time that human 
activity is a likely cause of the warming of the global atmosphere."<p>

Actually, scientists have long acknowledged that human activity, 
through release of "greenhouse" gases that trap heat, would cause some 
warming. As Robert Balling Jr., Director of the Office of Climatology 
at Arizona State University says, "The issue all along has been how 
much warming and whether it would be countered by other cooling 
mechanisms."<p>

Any environmentalist will gladly tell you the interaction of various 
forces on the globe can be terribly complicated. Probably the main 
complication here has been the effect that the heat build-up would 
have on water vapor, which in turn could cause a cooling effect.<p>

Such complications have spawned a huge number of models estimating 
just how much total heat increase the globe would experience, ranging 
from "utterly insignificant" to the doomsayers' "extra crispy."<p>

The real news of the IPCC draft report, according to report  reviewer 
and University of Virginia climatologist Dr. Patrick Michaels, is that 
the doomsayers' model is kaput.<p>

"What Stevens completely missed is that the mid-point of the model 
which they are now touting shows far less warming than the model upon 
which they based the 1992 Rio de Janeiro agreement," he told me.<p>

That treaty committed the nations of the earth in principle to spend 
tens of billions of dollars to reduce greenhouse emissions.<p>

Yet Michaels believes that this latest warming projection could still 
be far too high while another respected researcher, Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology climatologist and IPCC report reviewer Richard 
Lindzen, believes that warming will probably always be at a level 
difficult or impossible to detect above normal yearly fluctuations.<p>

Lindzen says newer projections show less and less warming than 
previous ones because they are being tweaked into doing so. The 
reason?  Real-life measurements are showing only slight warming. 
According to NASA scientist Roy Spenser, 17 years of satellite data 
show a rate of warming of about 7/100 of a degree per decade, or a 
rise of about 7/10 of a degree by the year 2100.<p>

That's "considerably less warming than climate models predict," he 
told me.<p>

Which leads us to part two of Stevens' attack, the potential 
catastrophe which is as likely as Ed McMahon showing up at your door 
with a check.<p>

It's not only that warming is far less than what was predicted. Less 
warming means fewer effects and less dire ones. More than this it 
seems increasingly clear that this warming is not a generalized one. 
Most of the warming it appears will be at night, when the temperatures 
are coldest.  Most will also be during the winter and in the frigid 
far north at that.<p>

"The season to season extremes are decreasing," says Michaels.<p>

Global warming-induced melting of the polar ice caps was the basis for 
Kevin Costner's embarrassing movie "Waterworld," in which virtually 
the entire earth is submerged. Terrified island nations are the 
strongest supporters of costly international sanctions against 
greenhouse gas restrictions.<p>

But, notes Michaels, if anything significant global warming could be 
expected to add to the polar caps by increasing precipitation above 
the poles. "Waterworld" flops again.<p>

Speaking of island nations, how about those predictions of vast 
numbers of  "super" hurricanes?  The Environmental Defense Fund's 
Michael Oppenheimer, an important source for Stevens, has predicted 
one of these as early as 1997,  killing 22,000 Floridians.<p>

But according to a paper by eight prominent researchers in the 
November 1994 Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 
Floridians can rest easy. They wrote, "year to year variations" in 
weather "are so great that they must effectively  swamp' any quite 
modest effect" of  global warming on hurricane frequency.<p>

It's true that the IPCC draft report on which Stevens based his dire 
story does mention the possibility of severe climate problems, but as 
Michael MacCraken, who is coordinating the U.S. governmental review of 
the IPCC report, explained to me, that's because it was just a first 
draft and the authors were obligated to mention any and all possible 
weather permutations, if only for later drafts to shoot them down.<p>

Tomorrow the earth COULD be invaded by flying saucers with tall aliens 
carrying cookbooks entitled To Serve Man. But idle speculations are 
best left for things like the O.J. Simpson trial, not matters of world 
import and the front page of  the New York Times. <p>

<title>Racial Politics Make Strange Enemies</title>

<center><h2>RACIAL POLITICS MAKE STRANGE ENEMIES </h2>
By Michael Fumento
</center>
<hr> <p>
 

Whoever said that lynch mobs are a thing of the past in this country 
hasn't seen the pack chasing Dinesh D'Souza with a rope.<p>

D'Souza is the John M. Olin fellow at the American Enterprise 
Institute (AEI) and author of the just-published book The End of 
Racism, which is the source of all the controversy.<p>

The book challenges the idea that racism is the primary cause of black 
problems, and says that the civil rights community, while once a boon 
to blacks, has become more of an albatross. D'Souza's ultimate target 
is failed liberal policies, which is why it's interesting that most of 
the early and very angry criticism of the work has come from the 
right.<p>   

Upon publication of the book, two AEI black conservative adjunct 
fellows, Glenn Loury and Robert Woodson, angrily resigned their 
positions. Loury also wrote a damning review of the book for the new 
conservative Weekly Standard.<p>

The resignations then became subject of an even more damning column by 
William Raspberry.  While not really a conservative, Raspberry has 
nonetheless shared the views of Woodson, Loury, and yes, D'Souza, that 
the liberal approach to the problems of the black community leaves 
much to be desired and that tagging all opponents as racists is 
generally counterproductive.<p>

Yet Raspberry tagged D'Souza's work as one "only racists could cheer" 
while Woodson went even further, calling D'Souza "the Mark Furhman of 
public policy."<p>

Can he really mean that? Can this be said of a writer whose book black 
conservative Thomas Sowell has called the best book on the topic in 
half a century?<p>

Would Mark Furhman have written a book former NAACP Chairman Margaret 
Bush Wilson has called "rich and provocative" or that a former 
chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said was "of  
stunning eloquence and power" with "a profound vision for transcending 
the pathology of race"?<p>

Part of the problem, no doubt, is that some people would rather attack 
a 742-page book than to bother actually reading it.<p>

Thus an article in USA Today says the book maintains "many people are 
racist for good reason." No, actually it says many people who might be 
accused of being racist are not; rather they act out of rational 
prejudice. Thus cab drivers--white, black, Hispanic, and Asian--are 
far more likely to shy away from young, black male fares because they 
know they are far more likely to be robbed and killed by them.<p>

Recall the Rev. Jesse Jackson's words about walking "down the street 
and hear[ing] footsteps and start thinking about robbery, then look 
around and see somebody white and feel relieved." <p>

Either the USA Today reporter is lying or hasn't read D'Souza's book, 
but in any case his readers will believe that D'Souza has said there 
can be a good reason for racism. Some of them repeat the charge in 
what may become a snowballing effect.<p>

Likewise, Raspberry concludes his column saying "D'Souza strives 
mightily to convince us there aren't any" racists. In fact, D'Souza 
has a whole chapter called "Bigotry in Black and White" which says 
that while the old style of racism is on the decline a new type is on 
horizon and may be on rise.<p>

As both author and book make repeatedly clear, the point isn't that 
racism is dead. Rather, D'Souza says,  "In a contemporary sense racism 
is no longer the prime obstacle raised by African-Americans or any 
other group.<p>

"If white racism ended tomorrow," D'Souza told me, "this would do 
little to improve black test scores, increase black savings rates, 
boost black rates of business formations, reduce black crime or 
strengthen black families. Those are the most serious cultural 
challenges facing black Americans, especially poor blacks. Racism is 
not the most serious challenge."<p>    

Do these sound like the ravings of a hooded skin-headed neo-Nazi Aryan 
Nation scumsucker? <p>

So why all this anger?<p>

Says D'Souza, "I think the hidden key to this thing is that I'm not 
black and that I'm discussing these things in public."<p>

That theory is certainly supported by the title of the column about 
D'Souza's book in the St. Petersburg (Florida) Times: "An Outsider's 
Arrogance." Ooh, feel the indignation!<p>

If D'Souza has been wrong about one thing it was in thinking that 
being "a person of color" would protect him from charges of messing 
with other people's business. As a native of Bombay, India, he is 
indeed a cultural and ethnic hodge-podge. He's Asian yet Caucasian 
rather than mongoloid; he's lighter than Clarence Thomas though darker 
than Whitney Houston and one hell of a lot darker than Michael 
Jackson.<p>

But black he ain't.<p>

Yet D'Souza was right in thinking that the debate over black problems 
must be open to all races and ethnic groups. It's a good thing that 
early women's rights advocates didn't have such a sectarian view. 
After all, by definition 100% of the people who gave women the right 
to vote were men.<p>

America is 88% non-black. It was white government policies that helped 
create the terrible problems so many blacks face today. Thus non-
blacks will have to play a major role in ending those problems. 
Disagree with D'Souza if you wish, but read him first. And salute one 
man with the guts to squarely confront one of our nation's most vexing 
problems.<p>

<title>ADM'S ETHANOL GETS BY WITH HELP FROM ITS FRIENDS -- Fumento</title>

<center><h2>ADM'S ETHANOL GETS BY WITH HELP FROM ITS FRIENDS</h2> <p> 
By Michael Fumento</center><p>
<hr>
 

Long before the current price-fixing scandal rocked the halls of 
Archer Daniels Midland, the self-styled "supermarket to the world," 
was a super rip-off for the public. And its co-conspirators in this 
scandal are the likes of President Bill Clinton and presidential 
wannabe Kansas Republican Senator Robert Dole.<p>

The tool used to siphon hundreds of millions of dollars yearly from 
the taxpayer to ADM is ethanol, alcohol distilled from corn. When 
mixed with gasoline, ethanol is called gasohol. About 55% of the 
ethanol produced in this country is manufactured by ADM, based in 
Decatur, Ill.  With sales of about $11 billion a year, ADM is the 
largest grain-processing company in the world.<p>

But gasohol has problems at the pump. First, it hurts mileage. Second, 
it's considerably more expensive than gasoline. Nobody is going to buy 
a fuel that both costs more and hurts mileage unless either A) the 
fuel is subsidized so that it doesn't cost more, or B) they are forced 
to. In this case, ADM has arranged through its friends in high places 
to make it C) both of the above.<p>

In addition to myriad state tax breaks, gasoline blended with ethanol 
is eligible for a federal tax credit of 5.4 cents a gallon, totalling 
an estimated $770 million a year. Over half that goes straight into 
ADM CEO Dwayne Andreas's coffers.<p>

Introducing that law was Dole, ADM's point man for its assault on the 
taxpayers. Dole has introduced over two dozen bills to help the 
ethanol industry and lobbied fiercely for it outside of Senate 
chambers as well.<p>

ADM needs people like Dole because ethanol is not only too expensive, 
it's worthless.<p>

Ethanol is touted as cleaner than gasoline. Indeed, it can reduce 
emissions of carbon monoxide, a fairly minor pollutant. While harmful 
in enclosed areas, it never causes serious health problems even at the 
very highest levels found in outdoor air.<p>

Moreover, ethanol only reduces carbon monoxide emissions from cars 
built before oxygen sensors were made mandatory in 1983 or whose 
oxygen sensors are broken. Repeated studies at the University of 
Denver using a remote testing device invented there have found that 
out of 250-300 late model vehicles tested, at most one will put out 
significant carbon monoxide emissions.<p>

Ethanol is also said to reduce ground-level ozone pollution, but a 
study by Sierra Research of Sacramento, California found that it would 
actually slightly INCREASE ozone production and increase smog. Indeed, 
in 1992 the EPA declared it could not be certified as a pollution-
fighting fuel for use in the nation's smoggiest cities. Immediately, 
as the Wall Street Journal put it, Dole "lobbied the administration 
from President Bush on down." Dole won, ADM won, and airbreathers lost 
as the EPA relented and certified ethanol.<p>

 Ethanol is also presented as a way to prop up corn prices by 
increasing corn demand. It does do that, but a by-product of its 
production is a corn mash sold as feed. That reduces the demand for 
soybeans, a crop corn farmers grow as part of crop rotation.<p>

In any case, it would be far cheaper to just funnel a subsidy directly 
corn farmers rather than funnel it through ADM.<p>

The real reason for ethanol's continued blessed existence isn't amber 
waves of grain but ample waves of cash. "Dwayne Andreas just owns me," 
former Democratic Party Chairman Robert Strauss once told the 
Washington Post. It turns out Andreas actually owns lots of other 
important people, too.<p>

Since just 1991, Andreas and his family, ADM, and the ADM PAC have 
contributed over $1.18 million to the Republican Party and $1.05 
million to the Democrats.<p>

But nobody has benefited from this largesse more than Bob Dole. To 
date, ADM has contributed over $85,000 to Dole's various campaign 
bids, along with various other perks.<p>

The most lucrative contribution to Dole was ADM's co-sponsorship of 
"Face-Off," a daily three-minute radio debate between Dole and 
Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy from 1984 to November 1987, 
when Dole declared his presidential candidacy. A spokesman for the 
show told me the value of this free advertising for Dole was about 
$840,000.<p>

Even while he denies being Andreas's chief  lackey, it is a position 
Dole jealously guards. In August, speaking of the ethanol industry, 
Dole told an audience at the Illinois State Fair, "So far, we've been 
shut out by this administration."<p>

Really?<p>

Last year, shortly after Dwayne Andreas served as co-chairman of a 
Democratic Party fundraiser and personally donated $100,000, the 
Clinton Administration, via the EPA, tried to mandate that about 10% 
of all gasoline sold nationally contain ethanol. But in May a federal 
appeals court declared the administration "exceeded its authority" in 
so doing.<p>

With that shot down, the ethanol lobby demanded a different gift, 
insisting that an ethanol-containing gasoline additive called ETBE 
receive the same tax break that pure ethanol gets. The Treasury 
Department quickly granted it. The ADM-supported American Corn 
Grower's Alliance then announced,  "Agriculture owes the President 
many thanks for seeing him continue to fulfill his pledge to be an 
advocate for ethanol, ETBE, and oxygenated fuels."<p>

(Note to the tobacco companies: If you want Clinton off your backs, 
just lace your cigarettes with a little ethanol.)<p>

The ADM executive who blew the whistle on its alleged price-fixing 
scheme says that the company's philosophy is: "The competitor is our 
friend; the consumer is our enemy." They could add to that another 
one: The politician is our lackey; the public is our sucker.<p>

<h2>Fatheads at FDA Opposing Best Interests of Fat Americans</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><b><i> Michael Fumento</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Unless you've been living in outer space or under a rock lately, 
you've noticed that our country has a serious problem with obesity. We 
are the fattest nation on earth. A recent British government report 
launched front-page headlines after it declared that if present trends 
continue 25% of British women and 18% of British men will be obese, 
meaning they are at least 20% fatter  than they should be. But in the 
United States already 35% women and 31% men are obese.  One 
contributing factor may be the faithful watchdogs of the Food and Drug 
Administration.<p>

Make no mistake, drugs are not the answer to the national problem.  
For some individuals, however, they have proven quite useful, 
especially one called dexfenfluramine. This is where our story begins.
<p>
Dexfenfluramine is no wonder drug.  Unlike the mercilessly hyped 
hormonal agent that you heard about in July, it doesn't promise that 
you can stuff your face till kingdom come and still maintain a figure 
that would put Kate Moss to shame.  On the other hand, dexfenfluramine 
works.<p>

At the September meeting, manufacturer Interneuron Pharmaceuticals 
Inc. said its drug helped 40 percent of patients in a study lose up to 
10 percent of their body weight, twice the amount lost with diet 
alone. Myriad other studies conducted over many years have shown the 
drug to be an effective weight-loss tool for those who really want and 
need it.<p>

Other studies, however, showed that when dexfenfluramine is given in 
ultra-high doses to animals, it can permanently alter their brain 
chemicals. But the level at which it causes this damage is 10 to 20 
times higher than that which humans receive.<p>

Nevertheless, in late September, an eight-member FDA panel voted 5-3 
against recommending approval of the drug for use in the United 
States. After some members left, those remaining voted 3-2 in favor of 
the drug but an FDA spokeswoman said the second vote could not be 
official and so a second meeting was ordered for November.<p>

In its caution, the FDA panel refused to weigh the slight possibility 
of harm of the drug versus the very real harm caused by obesity. It 
has been linked to heart disease, cancer, arthritis, gallbladder 
disease, gout, and a host of other nasties that includes even 
blindness.  The government estimates that 300,000 Americans will die 
prematurely from obesity this year, the second leading lifestyle-
related cause of death after cigarettes.<p>

Moreover, it's not like rats are our only guinea pigs, so to speak.  
More than a million people in more than 50 other countries are already 
using the drug. In some European countries they've had access to it 
for a decade.<p>

The refusal to approve this drug is just the latest example of the 
overweaning paternalism that characterized the FDA for many years but 
has now become quite onerous under current Commissioner David Kessler. 
It's not Kessler's fault that no new anti-obesity drug has been 
introduced in the last 22 years into this country that's splitting its 
collective seams, but it will be his fault if this amazing streak 
continues.<p>

But aren't there other drugs that can be used in the meantime? Yes, 
the second fiddle appears to be a combination of two drugs, 
phentermine and fenfluramine.  These, too, have been shown to be safe 
and effective. Like dexfenfluramine, however, they are treatments and 
not cures. The weight lost with them comes back at you like a steam 
train the day you stop taking them. But the FDA in its wisdom only 
allows doctors to prescribe them for three months.  In other words, as 
soon you get your weight down to a healthful level, as soon as you've 
glimpsed the towers of the Land of Oz, everything is taken from you.<p>

But how about those over-the-counter pills, phenylpropanolamine 
hydrochloride, mercifully shortened to "PPA." They appear to burn off 
about half a pound a week (though this amount can easily be 
overwhelmed by compensatory eating of even half a cheeseburger a day) 
but were shown much more effective when combined with caffeine.<p>

Indeed, caffeine itself has been shown repeatedly to speed up the 
metabolism and at high enough levels, especially when combined with 
ephedrine and small amounts of aspirin, to slowly induce weight loss--
again, unless the dieter ups his or her calorie intake even slightly.<p>

But amazingly, in 1991 the FDA placed caffeine on its list of 
ingredients banned from diet aids as being ineffective.<p>

What the heck is going on here? Is the FDA staffed at the highest 
levels by men who are into fat women?  Or women who are into fat men?  
Probably not.<p>

Instead, this is probably just another example of the FDA's obsessive 
paternalism and love of bureaucracy. I just happen to know about these 
abuses of authority and sanity because I happen to be writing a book 
on obesity. Were I writing a book on tennis elbow, I could probably 
rattle off for you how myriad examples of how the FDA impedes those 
seeking relief from that problem.<p>

Judith Stern of the American Obesity Association said that if the FDA 
panel recommends no on dexfenfluramine, "these doctors ought to be 
shot." That's a bit harsh.  How about we just force feed them until 
their shirt buttons pop off and they start developing that list of 
nasties that comes with obesity. A little bit of empathy never hurt 
anyone.<p>

<h2>Crime Study Doesn't Show Racism</h2>

One in three young black men is serving a criminal sentence, according 
to a new report that has received wide media coverage. Depending on 
your perspective, the timing couldn't have been more ironic or more 
fitting, coming as it did on the heels of the "not guilty" verdict in 
the O.J. Simpson case.
                                   <P>
Could this be what Simpson attorney Johnnie Cochran was talking about 
when he urged the jury to "send a message"?  Was the message that 
blacks are tired of blacks behind bars?
                <P>
There are certainly a lot there, though perhaps not as many as you 
might think from the news stories. In the report, the Sentencing 
Project, an advocacy group that favors alternatives to prison, 
estimates that on any given day 32 percent of black men ages 20 to 29 
are serving a criminal sentence. 
                                                                             <P>
That's 827,400 young black men. But what most of the news stories 
didn't tell you was that the majority were not behind bars but on 
probation or parole. If you don't think that's an important 
distinction, then you've never been in jail or prison and have never 
talked to anybody who has.
                                                                 <P>
The Sentencing Project study quite deliberately blurs this 
distinction, as when it says that "about 3/4 of all offenders under 
supervision have been convicted of a non-violent offense." True, but a 
1991 Department of Justice survey of state prison inmates found that 
of those actually incarcerated, half had committed violent crimes and 
fully 94% had either committed a violent crime or had received a 
previous criminal sentence.  
                                                  <P>
It's a good thing that the Sentencing Project didn't actually focus 
just on prison sentences, because the reality is that they have become 
a joke. Consider the four original suspects in the killing of British 
tourist Gary Colley at a Florida rest stop two years ago. One already 
had at least 56 prior arrests by the age of 13; another had more than 
30 arrests and a third had at least two dozen. The 13-year-old was 
released for lack of evidence and most recently was arrested for 
kidnaping and robbing a pizza deliverer at gunpoint.
                                         <P>
But the media reporting on the Sentencing Project study didn't go into 
any of this. Nor did the Rev. Jesse Jackson when he cited it at his 
"Million Man March" speech. Instead they concentrated on the disparity 
between black and white sentencing, noting that only 6.7% of 20-29-
year-old whites were ending up on the wrong side of the law.
                                <P>
To its credit, the study did not simply scream about racism, although 
the media attempted to portray it that way. It doesn't accuse all 
cops, or judges for that matter, of being Mark Fuhrmans. Rather, it 
says, the great majority of the increase in sentencing for blacks in 
recent years has come about because of a disproportionate emphasis on 
jailing those involved with crack cocaine usage.
                      <P>
Crack cocaine, it notes, is far more of a black problem than is powder 
cocaine, therefore discriminating against crack users and dealers 
means discriminating against blacks.
              <P>
But there is good reason to discriminate between types of cocaine. 
Several studies have concluded, as did that of Rutgers University 
researchers Kolin Chin and Jeffrey Fagan, that "arrest and conviction 
data suggest that violence and participation in drug selling are more 
strongly associated with crack than with cocaine [powder].
                                                      <P>
"The evidence is quite clear," American Enterprise Association 
Resident Scholar Doug Besharov told me. "Crack is a more addictive, 
violence-creating drug than is powder cocaine. Period."
                                             <P>
Further, the charge of drug possession is often used when the offender 
has committed other crimes that are much more serious but harder to 
prove. It is also often used in plea-bargaining cases, wherein the 
accused agrees to plead guilty to the least serious offense with which 
he has been charged.
                                  <P>
Besharov says, "There's no doubt that crack has assaulted the black 
community." Indeed, so have black criminals. Ninety percent of their 
victims are black themselves. White liberal do-gooders such as make up 
most of the staff at the Sentencing Project have little to fear if we 
slacken our efforts at criminal enforcement.
                         <P>
There's no doubt there's something pathologically wrong in a society 
in which a third of the members of the second-largest race are 
involved in the criminal justice system.  Throwing young men in prison 
or putting them on probation or parole doesn't solve this problem. The 
ultimate solution lies in getting rid of government programs that 
break down the family, like Aid to Families with Dependent Children, 
in improving the quality of public schools, in fostering a culture of 
personal responsibility and in no longer blaming racism for every 
black problem.
    <P>
So long as business as usual goes on in the black inner-cities, they 
will produce vast numbers of criminals and many of these will wind up 
in the penal system. And business as usual, it is.  After the O.J. 
Simpson verdict, one Nation of Islam leader called on Simpson to 
become an active symbol for the nation's troubled black youth. Jesse 
Jackson gushed, "O.J. can now be a big force, in my judgment, in 
taking the lead against domestic violence."
                                                         <P>
Egad! And John Wayne Gacy should have opened a home for wayward boys 
while Jeffrey Dahmer should have become president of the National 
Restaurant Association.
                                              <P>
No, putting away young black men doesn't cure the problem. But until 
we're willing to apply the cure, it can keep the problem from becoming 
that much worse.
                                    <P>

<title>Fumento:  Population Action Tells a Fish Story about Fish Supply </title>

<h2>Population Action Tells a Fish Story about Fish Supply </h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>

 
 

"A burgeoning population and the growing demand for seafood may make 
fish unavailable to nearly a billion of the world's poor in the next 
century, says a new report." If you read USA Today or any number of 
other papers that carried a similar story, you probably believe that. 
Which is too bad because the report, issued by the pro-population 
control Population Action International is just one big, well, fish 
story.
 <P>
There's one huge problem with the report.  See if you can pick it out 
by reading between the lines of report co-author Robert Engelman. 
"We're up against the wall," he said. "Since the end of the  80s, 
we've been catching the same amount of wild fish around the world, 
[but] there are about 90 million more people every year."
               <P>
Did you notice the qualifying word: "wild"?  Yes, the statement is 
true for wild fish but completely ignores the role of farmed fish, 
called "aquaculture."  Looking at data provided in a 1995 United 
Nations Food and Agricultural Organization publication, "The State of 
World Fisheries and Aquaculture," we see that for the earliest year 
provided (1984) there were 51,105 thousand tons of wild fish caught 
with 6,933 thousand tons raised on farms.  Wild fish capture peaked 
out in 1989 and has dropped slightly to 56,470 thousand tons by 1993, 
but aquaculture continued growing like gangbusters to 15,800 tons by 
1993.
     <P>
Cmbining both types of fish, there was far from a decline but rather a 
24% increase in the nine-year period, fueled by a 128% growth in 
aquaculture. At the same time world population increased by only 16%. 
Unless you just happen to hate fish, that's a mighty nice "wall" we're 
up against. Far from running out of the slimy things, we're 
practically swimming in them.
                    <P>
Unfortunately, neither USA Today nor some of the other papers that 
carried the story bothered to mention aquaculture. In fact, nobody who 
carried the story allowed any criticism of the report at all.
                              <P>
The Population Action International study does mention the growing 
aquaculture industry, saying it "compensates somewhat for declines in 
fish catches." It even depicts a chart showing its phenomenal growth. 
But it downplays the industry, saying "Cultivation of fish has so far 
proven too costly to provide large amounts of food to poor people."
   <P>
But the aforementioned U.N. publication, using the same data as 
Population Action International, says otherwise. "The balance of 31 
million tons in the supplies of food fish required by the year 2010 
would have to come from aquaculture, which has been expanding at a 
rate of one million tons a year, increasing to almost two million tons 
in 1993." Meanwhile, to continue feeding the world at the same rate 
would require "an overall average annual increase of less than one 
million tons a year."
            <P>
While Population Action says, "There is little prospect for major 
expansion of aquaculture in Africa, the U.N. report says aquaculture's 
phenomenal "growth should continue, recognizing the SIGNIFICANT 
POTENTIAL OF INCREASED FARMED FISH PRODUCTION IN AFRICA and Latin 
America." (Emphasis mine.)
                         <P>
Yet, the real powerhouse could be the United States. So far all of 
North America produces only 3.7% of the world's aquaculture.  The 
United States produces less than a 16th of China's output. The reason 
is that Americans are not big fish eaters and that, exactly opposite 
of what Population Action is telling us, those who are big fish eaters 
are finding or growing a plentiful supply. But if that ever changes, 
America's ingenious farming know-how combined with abundant lakes and 
waterways will combine to make us not just the breadbasket but also 
the fishbasket of the world.
                                    <P>
What we're seeing is a rapid transition from depending on wild fish to 
raising our own which parallels civilization's movement from hunting 
and gathering to husbanding animals and raising crops. The very reason 
that fish farming is catching on so rapidly is that it is so much 
cheaper and more efficient than setting out in boats and hoping for 
good fortune. Less romantic perhaps, but them's the breaks.
                                               <P>
The problem with all the population control groups and individual 
gurus like Paul Ehrlich is that they first decided they were against 
population growth and have spent the entire time since then trying to 
find evidence to justify their position, rather than forming their 
position based on the evidence. The result has been a stream of 
nonsense that essentially began with Ehrlich's 1968 book The 
Population Bomb which told us that "the battle to feed humanity is 
over."
                                                        <P>
In fact, except for the occasional politically-inspired famine such as 
Ethiopia's, humanity is much better fed today than it was in 1968. 
Man's ingenuity in providing new food supplies has readily outpaced 
his growth in population growth.  Now, even as population growth is 
already slowing on its own, we're beginning a new era of genetically-
designed foods that will make even progress to date look anemic.
                                                                    <P>
 My advice to the population controllers:  If you don't like having 
more people around in  the same sense a lot of American just don't 
like eating fish, then simply say so. Quit concocting false evidence 
to scare everyone who doesn't share your taste.
                                                                             <P>
As for the rest of us, just ask any mermaid you happen to see, "What's 
a big fib?" "The Population Action study."

<title>Fumento:  (W.R.) Grace Under Fire--For All the Wrong Reasons </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>(W.R.) Grace Under Fire--For All the Wrong Reasons </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>
 

It's clearly a case of Grace under fire.  No, not the popular 
television show, but the Florida-based company W.R. Grace, the world's largest maker of speciality chemicals. Doing the firing is an activist group called the Foundation for Economic Trends (FET), headed up by the vociferous Jeremy Rifkin. Rifkin is leading a coalition of some of 200 groups and brandishing a petition signed by 100,000 Indian citizens.
<p>
Why the fuss?  To understand, you have to know a little about 
something called a neem tree.
<p>
The neem tree grows in a number of countries with tropical climates, 
but is especially plentiful and revered in India. Scientists call it 
one of the most helpful plants on earth, while Indians consider it 
sacred, calling it "the curer of all ailments." Its bark, leaves, 
flowers, and seeds are used to treat a variety of illnesses including 
leprosy, diabetes, ulcers, and skin disorders. The twigs are used as 
an antiseptic toothbrush while the seed oil is used to make toothpaste 
and soap. Oil from the seeds is a potent spermicide. The powdered 
leaves are used for facial cream.
<p>
In short, the neem appears to do everything but take your pulse and 
check your blood pressure. 
<p>
But what most appeals to the folks at W.R. Grace is that oil from the 
seeds is a powerful insecticide, repelling more than 200 species of 
bugs. The oil has long been used as such by Indians, but in its 
natural state the pesticide properties begin to decay within a matter 
of weeks or even days. Grace has developed a way of making this 
natural pesticide available to everyone by stabilizing it, thereby 
extending its shelf life for two years or more. The company has 
received a patent for the process.
<p>
"Foul!" cries Rifkin, who calls the patent "genetic colonialism" and 
is trying to get it revoked. "What we have here in broad terms," he 
told me, "is the beginning of worldwide discussion on who should 
control the gene pool."
<p>
I tried very hard to extract a valid point from Mr. Rifkin but failed.<p>  
First, he admitted that Grace's actions in securing a patent using 
Third World resources is hardly new or exceptional, but is just 
another case of "northern countries" exploiting "native genetic 
resources."
<p>
It's a bizarre accusation. Nobody should "control the gene pool," 
obviously, and Grace isn't trying. It didn't apply for a patent on the 
neem tree or its seeds or the oil from the seeds. The patent was for a 
process. To deny its patent because it involves a living thing is like 
saying someone can't get a patent for building a better mousetrap 
because the base of the mousetrap is made from wood.
<p>
Under U.S. law, a process or substance or invention may receive a 
patent--which is a temporary right of exclusive use and production--if 
it is novel, useful, and not obvious. You cannot therefore patent a 
gene, either here or abroad, since genes have always been around. <p>What 
you can do is patent a process you have developed using those genes or 
their product--in this case the oil from seeds.
<p>
All Grace's patent restricts is the ability to use the same 
stabilization method they have used. It doesn't even apply to 
extraction or processing of the neem extract prior to stabilization.  
<p>Nor does it even apply in India, since U.S. patent law doesn't extend 
there.
<p>
Rifkin says Grace's process isn't really even novel and that the 
patent should have been denied on that basis alone. Fine, let the 
Patent Office decide that.
<p>
Thus the "genetic" part of Rifkin's charge is obviously just a straw 
man.
<p>
What apparently rankles him is that some fat-cat Western company--no 
doubt headed up by porcine cigar-chompers--is once again exploiting 
Third World wealth. Rifkin complained to me that this was just another 
case of "northern countries" exploiting "native genetic resources."
<p>
The neem tree happens to be a convenient vehicle for his anti-
corporate crusade.
<p>
"Rifkin has cleverly picked an emotional issue because it's a 
religious tree in a Third World country," Says Henry Miller, a senior 
research fellow at the Hoover Institution in Stanford, California and 
a former FDA official.
<p>
But again, the colonialism charge just doesn't stick with Grace.
<p>
Some 22 companies have obtained patents regarding the neem tree, of 
which three are Indian. Grace buys its neem seeds on the open market 
and purchases less than three percent of the crop, which is 
unfortunate since 84% of the neem crop falls to the ground unharvested 
and simply rots.  Grace's Indian operation is run through an Indian 
holding firm, of which Grace is just a minority owner.
<p>
If this is the best one can do these days in ferreting out Ugly 
Americans, we Americans must be pretty handsome these days.
<p>
Rifkin and the FET are right that just because something CAN be done 
doesn't mean it SHOULD be done.  We need industry watchdogs like FET. 
<p>But there are no real ethical issues involved here, much less any of 
the Brave New World variety that FET likes to talk about. 
<p>
There's just a tree, with some really terrific products to offer, and 
one American company that isn't about to let its nationality get in 
the way of offering them.

<P> 
FOX RIVER GROVE, ILLINOIS--
 
It's called "Seven Angels Crossing" now.  As I write this, it's still 
blocked off.  Wreaths of flowers lie next to a light pole at the 
track. Marquees in the area express the sentiments of local 
businesses: "Our thoughts are with you," "Our prayers go out to you," 
"Pray for the families," "Seven angels, now in heaven." And everywhere 
there are the blue and white ribbons that used to simply be the colors 
of Cary-Grove High School but now mean so much more.
<p>
In late October, a commuter train slammed into a bus here, killing 
five children more or less immediately.  Two more died in the 
hospital.  To say that everyone in the towns of Cary and Fox River 
Grove was touched by the killings sounds cliche, yet it is true. I 
have friends here.  Their own children are too young to be in high 
school, but the boy across the street from them was killed and the 
brother of a girl who plays with their children was injured.
<p>
And everyone is asking the same question: "Why?"
<p>
Current attention is focusing on the signal lights at the crossing, 
and the crossing itself. It turns out that in the two-year period 
before the accident, some 45 complaints were filed with Illinois and 
railroad transportation officials over the crossing and the lights, 
though whether that proves an exceptional number has yet to be seen.
<p>
If it turns out it was an unusually hazardous crossing yet nothing was 
done about it, this will prove to a great extent to be business as 
usual. If there's one thing I've learned about Americans' attitudes 
towards risk in the years I've written about the subject, it is that 
they don't really understand it.  The relationship between that which 
we should fear and that which we do fear is often tenuous at best.  
This goes likewise for expenditures to reduce risks.
<p>
Thus, for example, under a 1991 EPA drinking water regulation, we 
spend $653 million per premature death averted.  A 1988 hazardous 
waste land disposal ban of the EPA costs $4.19 BILLION. An asbestos 
occupational exposure limit laid down in 1986 cost business $71 
million per life while one for arsenic cost $74 million.
<p>
These are not the highest figures I could find, nor the lowest. 
Suffice to say that saving lives through environmental regulation is 
routinely measured in the millions per person.
<p>
By comparison, expenditures that would prevent accidental deaths come 
relatively cheap.  Since we don't know yet what went wrong here in Fox 
River Grove, we can't put a price on fixing it.  But a Harvard Center 
for Risk Analysis publication puts the price of installing flashing 
lights at railway crossings that don't yet have them at a mere 
$733,523 per life saved. Add gates to that and you're still looking at 
only $787,267.  
<p>
"It is an enigma," Book of Risks author Larry Laudan told me, that a 
society that allows so many risky activities in terms of accidents 
will, "at the same time, demand the expenditures of tens of billions 
of dollars [over $115 billion, actually] annually on pollution control 
measures."  Drunk drivers alone, Laudan said, "do far more harm in 
producing injuries and death than ALL known sources of pollution. The 
ultimate irony is that it is not even clear that pollution abatement 
efforts always do much good."
<p>
The explanation, perhaps, says Laudan, "is the remarkable success of 
the environmental movement in persuading us that pollution is one of 
the principal killers of Americans."
<p>
He also cites "the unthinking fear that invisible dangers induce.  
Like radiation, pollution generally cannot be seen or felt.  By 
contrast, most causes of accidents are tangible and palpable--even 
familiar.  Psychologists repeatedly have shown that this sort of 
familiarity breeds indifference, if not contempt."
<p>
Often we find out too late that society's familiarity and contempt 
becomes the undoing of us or our loved ones.  I found out three years 
ago when my car went careening off a cliff just south of Big Sur on 
California's notorious Pacific Coast Highway.  The car rolled several 
times before coming to a halt 350 feet down, just short of the rocks 
at the edge of the water. Despite wearing a seat belt, my girlfriend 
broke her skull and neck and I was told she would probably die.  I 
didn't feel so good myself.
<p>
The good news is that we both survived and are doing fine, thank you.  
The bad news is that when I went back to the accident site I found it 
marked by a cross for a young man whose car had also gone over but who 
hadn't been so lucky.
<p>
When I inquired at the state Department of Transportation to find out 
how much a guardrail at this literal dead man's curve would have cost, 
I was told $1,000. But in this, the most environmentally conscious and 
most environmental regulation-happy state in the country, there was no 
$1,000 to spare for a guard rail.
<p>
Of course, environmental regulatory costs are buried--passed on to 
private businesses--while guard rails require explicit tax 
expenditures. But eventually, we pay for both
<p>
A rich country can afford adequate rail crossings, guard rails, and 
good environmental laws.  But no country can afford indiscriminate 
spending inspired by political activists instead of by careful cost-
benefit analyses. Let's stop finding out the hard way what our 
priorities should be. I know seven sets of parents whom I think would 
want it that way.

<html><head><title>Fumento:  Delaney Clause is Nostalgia We Can't Afford</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><i>11/20/95</i><hr><h2>Delaney Clause is Nostalgia We Can't Afford</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a></center><hr>
<P>
What would you say if your city's housing code dwelled at great length 
on the sturdiness and structure of thatched roofs? What if vehicle 
regulations required blinders on your automobile so that it doesn't 
shy when an emergency vehicle passes by?
<p>
If you like those ideas, you'd love the federal Delaney Clause.
<p>
The Delaney Clause prohibits any measurable residue (from, say, 
pesticides) that has been found to cause cancer in either animals or 
man, in any processed food. Back in 1958, when it was passed as part 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, it seemed to make sense. 
But just as "Married with Children" humor has replaced that of "Leave 
it to Beaver" (sigh), science has long since passed by Delaney.
<p>
That's in part because back when Delaney was passed, residues could 
only be measured in parts per thousand. Now they can be measured in 
parts per trillion and sometimes even in parts per quintillion. Let's 
say you detect a part per quadrillion in a plum product. That's the 
equivalent of one plum in 73,511,000 tons.
<p>
Delaney is also outdated because it greatly preceded the use of 
maximum tolerated dose testing in laboratory animals which didn't get 
going in earnest until the late 1960s. Under such testing, about half 
of all chemicals--both natural and synthetic--have caused tumors, 
which makes them verboten under Delaney.
<p>
Critics say this makes such testing useless, because it can't possibly 
be that half of everything is carcinogenic.
<p>
The fact that the natural world is full of rodent carcinogens makes 
Delaney "absurd," says pre-eminent Berkeley biologist Bruce Ames.
<p>
"There are a thousand chemicals in a cup of coffee. Twenty-six have 
been tested and 19 have already proven positive, leaving about a 
thousand left to test," Ames told me. "The FDA would be laughed at if 
it tried to keep coffee from being added to ice cream. But there's no 
reason to think it's really a hazard."
<p>
In any case, decades after Delaney was passed, this rodent testing 
became its backbone.
<p>
Congress in 1958 could no more have predicted these new developments 
than the Continental Congress could have predicted the advent of 
warplanes, yet nobody claims we need to be restricted by language in 
the Constitution which only allows funding for an Army and a Navy. 
<p>
In addition to allowing natural rodent carcinogens while banning 
synthetic ones, Delaney encompasses another double standard.
<p>
First, more recent legislation does allow rodent carcinogens in 
unprocessed food, so long as the level is low enough under a certain 
formula to qualify as a "negligible risk." A fresh fruit could have a 
10 parts per billion of a pesticide and be allowed but if it's turned 
into a sauce or juice it might have only 1 part per billion and be 
banned.
<p>
But, some might argue, if Delaney has worked to date, why fix it if it 
ain't broke? In fact, it's always been broken but ignored. Because of 
the outrageousness of actually applying it, the EPA has simply chosen 
not to. But that's about to change because of a lawsuit the Natural 
Resources Defense Council won against the Agency, forcing strict 
compliance with the legislation.
<p>
Now, like it or not, the EPA has no choice but to ban 85 uses of 38 
different pesticide active ingredients. According to the Washington, 
D.C.-based non-profit research group National Center for Food and 
Agricultural Policy (NCFAP), this could result in increased production 
costs of $175 million over the next year and $212 million per year 
after that. The crops most affected would be potatoes, apples, and 
sugarcane, which account for 55% of the total potential costs. Look 
for your grocery bill to go up accordingly.
<p>
Said NCFAP Senior Research Associate Leonard P. Gianessi, ". . . the 
risks of the Delaney-listed pesticide uses are negligible, while the 
economic benefits that they provide are estimated to be $400 million 
per year."
<p>
The Delaney Clause was always too simplistic for its own good. 
Explains environmentalist and University of California biologist 
Garret Hardin, "The Delaney Act was passed because congressmen are old 
men. They are afraid of cancer. Because they're scared, they wanted 
zero tolerance. They did not get any scientific advice.  
Environmentalists who are scientists would never support a zero 
tolerance level for anything."
<p>
That's why even such ardent cheerleaders for pesticide regulation as 
regulation as New York Mt. Sinai pediatrician Dr. Phillip Landrigan 
and Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) have called for its 
replacement by something more workable.
<p>
Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Indiana) has introduced a bill which would 
implement recommendations by the National Research Council, including 
a "negligible risk" standard for both processed and raw foods. This 
determination would be made by the EPA Administrator, assisted by a 
newly-created science review panel.
<p>
Current EPA Administrator Carol Browner has already agreed in 
principle to such a scheme.
<p>
Make no mistake. Nostalgia is a great thing within limits, and here's 
to bringing back "Leave it to Beaver"-type shows in prime time while 
pulling the handle on the toilet in which "Married with Children" 
swims. But when the health and safety of people are concerned, our 
regulations need to reflect present the latest scientific evidence, 
not the state of the art from 1958.

<P>
 "In California, everything is so-o-o-o touchy feeling," [sic] said 
actress and comedienne Tracey Ullman, in explaining why she was moving 
herself and her daughter back to the United Kingdom. "They are into 
this silly outcome-based education where it doesn't matter if she  
knew HOW to spell her name as long as she knew WHO she was.  And it 
didn't matter if she KNEW that two plus two was four as long as she 
had enough self-confidence to ASK how to get  to the conclusion of the 
problem.' What a crock! She was going to end up as a dumb as a 
mudflap. Had to get her out."
<p>
Europeans have long made fun of two major American products, its beer 
and its education. But we're making great progress--with our beer. 
Education, however, continues to decay, with our students routinely 
rating themselves among the highest in the world while scoring  among 
the poorest.
<p>
The latest indication came with National Assessment of  Educational 
Progress scores recently released showing that "don't know much about 
history" has gone from being the line of a song to being the American 
national anthem.  Only 11% of seniors, 14% of eighth graders and 17% 
of fourth graders are considered "proficient" in U.S. history.  
They're comparative geniuses when it comes to geography though, with 
31% of the seniors proficient.
<p>
Some defenders of the students' performance claim the questions were 
really tough. Sure, like the one that asked whether New York, 
California, Illinois, or Texas was one of the 13 original colonies.  
Thirty-two percent of fourth-graders got that right.
<p>
Of course, 200  years is a long time ago.  So another question asked 
which conflict--World War I, World War II, the Mexican-American War, 
or Vietnam--was fought to contain communism.  Even fewer fourth-
graders got that cranium-cracker.
<p>
Sadly, test scores have been in decline for decades now, and to place 
the blame entirely on anything new is somewhat unfair.  But they were 
SUPPOSED to be getting better.  Blame it on  "outcome-based 
education."
<p>
Sounds harmless, doesn't it? In fact, Ullman's summary was amazingly 
void of hyperbole. "Outcome-based education" is a stealth term.
<p>
"It was a hijacking of the idea that schools should have been made 
more accountable but it made them less," author Charles Sykes told me 
in an interview. "Some conservative reformers in the 1980s began 
saying schools should be judged on the basis of outcome instead of 
inputs. Lots of governors and legislators bought into it only later to 
find out it was holistic healing and environmental stewardship."
<p>
Sykes's newest book is a hard critique of outcome-based education 
called Dumbing Down Uur Kids: Why America's Children Feel Good About 
Themselves but Can't Read, Write, or Add.  
<p>
The book is replete with chilling "scenes from the front." Thus, 
hearing about the poor history scores is hardly shocking after reading 
that in the upscale Denver suburb of Littleton a principal freely 
admitted that it was not important for students to learn any specific 
historical fact, including the ability to define either the Holocaust 
or World War II. 
<p>
Naturally such "educators" aren't too keen on tests and grading. Many 
outcome based school districts have abolished traditional grading 
entirely, replacing it instead with such as "C" for "consistently," 
"S" for "sometimes" and "N" for "not yet."
<p>
Nationally we have seen the best indicator of the increasing dumbness 
of our children simply erased.  Last year the administrators of the 
SAT pushed up the scoring standard so that scores just above 400 would 
now be pushed up to 500. In one fell swoop, the ability to compare 
today's student scores with those of their predecessors was destroyed.
<p>
It's also now possible to get a perfect SAT score without getting all 
the answers correct.
<p>
"Recognizing they were under more scrutiny to raise academic 
standards," Sykes told me, OBE administrators "have simply decided to 
make the standards unmeasurable.  A lot of schools are abolishing them 
and others are making everyone a winner."
<p>
Thus many Colorado schools have multiple valedictorians, with Boulder 
High School producing an amazing 26. And to think poor, inner-city 
schools can only afford one.
<p>
OBE also incorporates the self-esteem movement that has been around 
for decades. In theory, since high self-esteem and doing well are 
linked, by increasing self-esteem we can increase performance.  But 
Sykes points out that they're probably putting the proverbial cart 
before the, that it's success that drives self-esteem and not the 
other way around.
<p>
The self-esteem obsession is not only a waste but probably 
detrimental, he says. "If having kids feel good is top priority, you 
will be afraid to ask too much of them. In the long run this is a 
fraud because kids eventually hit reality like a brick wall, in 
college or the work world."
<p>
But Sykes believes there will be an education revolution.
<p>
"Public opinion is pretty clear," he says. "And OBE is taking schools 
in exactly the opposite direction. Add to this that the stakes are 
higher than ever since kids need to be better educated than they used 
to be.  Old factory jobs no longer exist.  The education 
establishment's response to all this is denial, vilification of 
critics, and circling of the wagons. To me that's a description of an 
institution that's ready to collapse.
<p>
Let's just hope it happens before all our kids are dumber than 
mudflaps.

<html><head><title>Fumento:  Ignored Report Says EPA Wrong on Passive Smoking </title></head>

<i>12/7/95</i><hr><h2>Ignored Report Says EPA Wrong on Passive Smoking </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>

<P>

With a man who had torched three buildings  running around Boulder, 
Colorado city police were following smoke trails.  They caught their 
man, and he now faces a fine of $1,000 or 90 days in jail.  No, the 
perpetrator wasn't the arsonist (who was caught that same day); he was 
the owner of a bar  and a violator of Boulder's new anti-smoking law, 
one of the most draconian in the country.
<P>
The Boulder law goes way beyond mandating separate areas for smokers.  
Essentially it demands that smokers be kept away from non-smokers in 
hermetically-sealed rooms, as if they were the germ featured in the 
1971 movie The Andromeda Strain.  But a new report by the 
Congressional Research Service (CRS) finds that the basis for it, as 
well as all the other anti-smoking laws which have swept the country 
since December of 1992, is scientifically bankrupt.
<P>
This refutes a much-publicized 1992 study, conducted by the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which claimed as many as 3,000 
Americans die each year of lung cancer from somebody else's cigarette 
smoke. The EPA based its findings on a combined study (called a meta-
analysis) of 11 separate studies, which between them found 119 lung 
cancers among non-smoking spouses of smokers where 100 would be 
expected. Epidemiologists call this a "risk ratio" of 1.19. 
<P>
At the time, many people including myself criticized the EPA report, 
saying that such a small apparently increased risk (so tiny, in fact, 
that the medical community has rejected much larger ratios as being 
conclusive on other potential carcinogens) that the tiniest problem 
could throw the whole thing off.
<P>
We also questioned the EPA's use of a 90% confidence interval, meaning 
that there was a 10% possibility the results had been arrived at by 
chance.  The gold standard in epidemiology has always been a 95% 
confidence interval, leaving only a 5% possibility of a result 
occurring by chance.  Curiously, the Agency rejected that, in what 
appeared to be a rigging of the results. It was like moving the goal 
post to the three yard line because the football had fallen two yards 
short of a touchdown.
<P>
The new CRS report, which you're hearing about probably for the first 
time here because with the sole exception of the Washington Times (and 
an editorial in Investor's Business Daily) the media decided you 
didn't need to know about it, says we were right and the EPA was 
wrong.
<P>
 That report was produced in response to a proposed Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration ruling that would ban smoking in 
federal workplaces.  It found no basis for such a ban.
<P>
Instead, it said the EPA's meta-analysis showed that, "Even when 
overall risk is considered, it is a very small risk and is not 
statistically significant at the 95% level."
<P>
The CRS also analyzed four other recent passive smoking studies.  Of 
them, only one--by Dr. Elizabeth Fontham--showed a significant 
increased risk.  Two others showed no higher risk and a third showed 
only a slight, statistically insignificant risk.
<P>
As is, that's something of a wash.  But even the Fontham study may not 
actually show an increased risk, said the CRS.  This is because of 
something called "smoker misclassification."  Surveys show that some 
people who claim to be nonsmokers are actually current or former 
smokers.  The EPA has recognized this phenomenon and has built in a 
small safety margin to account for it in the Fontham study.  But 
evidence indicates this safety factor was probably too small, and CRS 
says "a small adjustment could render the overall Fontham  results 
statistically insignificant at the 95% level."
<P>
So the only truly significant positive study would have been rendered 
insignificant.
<P>
Moreover, the CRS noted that the other three studies didn't allow for 
unidentified smokers. Had they done so, the lack of evidence for 
smoking's hazards to innocent bystanders would have been even more 
obvious.   
<P>
The ultimate purpose of the campaign that culminated in the EPA report 
was never to protect non-smokers but to harass and intimidate smokers 
themselves into quitting.  Now it could be said that smokers were in 
effect not just hurting themselves but murdering non-smokers.  So what 
if it's not true?  The end--getting active smokers to quit--justifies 
the means.  Right?
<P>
Such paternalism is obnoxious.  Anybody with two brain cells to rub 
together knows that smoking is harmful and can be fatal. More than a 
hundred years before the famous 1964 surgeon general's report, 
cigarettes were known as "coffin nails." Smokers may be irrational, 
but irrationality within limits is protected in our society.
<P>
Meanwhile, where does such paternalism end?  One of the arresting 
officers in Boulder, a female, was quite corpulent.  (Trendy towns 
like Boulder are willing to overlook beefy cops if it means beefing up 
the number of female officers on the force.) Obesity is considered to 
cause 300,000 premature deaths a year, 100 times the EPA estimate for 
lung cancers caused by passive smoking.  Perhaps that officer should 
arrest the next waiter who puts a plate of Fettuccine Alfredo before 
her.  "Boy, you in a heap  o trouble for heapin' that pasta so high!"
<P>
Perhaps I shouldn't give them any ideas.

<i>12/13/95</i><hr><h2>The Long Suppressed Truth About AIDS</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>

<P>
You've heard it over and over in the media: AIDS is "an equal 
opportunity destroyer" that threatens all Americans "without 
discriminating."  Now a new study in Science magazine shows an 
epidemic both smaller than the government has claimed--and one that 
clearly does discriminate.
<P>
The media treated it as quite a revelation.  In fact, as we shall see, 
this same vital information was available seven years ago and was 
deliberately suppressed.
<P>
The Science study, by NCI statistician Phil Rosenberg, shows a 
tremendous disparity between infected groups. For example, while as of 
January 1993, only one in 2,000 American white females between the 
ages of 18 and 59 was living with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, one 
in 204 white males was.  For black females the rate is one in 135, 
while black males have the highest infection rate of all at one in 44. 
Hispanics fall somewhere between, with one in 294 females and one in 
69 males.
<P>
While Rosenberg's data don't look at risk factors, the explanation for 
the disparities is that male homosexuality and intravenous drug abuse 
(which is primarily male) continue to account for the vast majority of 
new infections.
<P>
Rosenberg's calculations also put to the lie the official government 
estimate of one million current infections.  He finds instead a range 
of 630,000 to 897,000 American living with the virus. 
<P>
To come up with these figures, Rosenberg used a technique called 
backcalculation.  It simply requires looking at the number of current 
AIDS cases and then calculates back from them to when the infections 
must have taken place.  From there it projects a trend line.
<P>
It's such a simple technique that you may be wondering why it took 
somebody so long to apply it to AIDS.  And the answer is that it 
didn't.  Joel Hay, then of the Hoover Institution and now the head of 
the Department of Pharmaceutical Economics at the University of 
California, Los Angeles, first applied backcalculation to the epidemic 
in 1988.  The figures he came up with, allowing for new infections in 
the years since,  are in the same ballpark as Rosenberg's figures.  
Hay's estimate was that there were as few as 500,000 infections at the 
time.
<P>
Hay's calculations were so appealingly simple and straightforward that 
I didn't hesitate to use them in my 1990 book, The Myth of 
Heterosexual AIDS.  But when Hay presented his data to the federal 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) at the international 
AIDS conference in Stockholm in 1988, the agency wanted nothing to do 
with them. 
<P>
At that time the CDC's official estimate was 1 to 1.5 million 
infections, which the media regularly shortened to "as many as 1.5 
million."  Ignoring Hay, the CDC relied on calculations by other 
modelers which had so many variables that they were virtual Rube 
Goldberg devices on paper.
<P>
That may have been part of their attraction.  Bureaucrats loathe 
simplicity.  But clearly a factor in the  CDC's decision was that 
Hay's numbers were just too darned low.
<P>
"They said, well, if the numbers just end up less than we say they 
are, we'll just pat ourselves on the back and say we helped prevent a 
major epidemic," says Hay now. 
<P>
Ultimately, as AIDS cases stubbornly refused to come in anywhere near 
as fast as the CDC had projected, the agency was forced to lower and 
finally abandon its projection of future AIDS cases and to lower its 
infection estimate to a flat one million.
<P>
Then last year its officials told the House Energy and Commerce 
Subcommittee on Health it was considering lowering that figure even 
more to 800,000.  But homosexual committee member Gerry Studds (D-
Mass.) threw a tantrum, and the officials ran away, tails tucked 
firmly between legs.  So the official figure remains at one million.
<P>
As for the tremendous disparity between male and female infections, 
and between those of whites and blacks, all that too was known long 
ago.  I emphasized these disparities in my first AIDS article way back 
in 1987 in Commentary magazine, adding that, "Every dollar spent, 
every commercial made, every health warning released, that does not 
specify [the actual risk factors for contracting AIDS] is a lie, a 
waste of funds and energy, and a cruel diversion."
<P>
Why then, in every year since 1987 has the CDC insisted on using its 
hundreds of millions of dollars allotted for "education" to air TV 
campaigns aimed squarely at white, middle class heterosexuals?  Quite 
simply to "democratize" the disease.  Specialty diseases get small, 
specialty budgets.  Diseases portrayed as threatening every last 
American get nice fat budgets, explaining why AIDS gets more research 
and education money than heart disease even though heart disease kills 
about 20 times as many Americans.
<P>
The media has eagerly played along, fearing that a disease which has 
<P>
homosexuals as its primary victims won't get the kind of attention the 
media has decided for us this disease deserves.
<P>
And still the propaganda continues.  The week after the Science report 
came out, ABC broadcast an afterschool special "Positive: A Journey 
into AIDS," featuring two soap opera actors whose characters have 
AIDS.  One is male, one female and both are middle class whites.
<P>
The result of denying the true risk factors? The people least at risk 
live in needless terror. The people most at risk become complacent and 
more likely to die before their time.

<i>12/21/95</i><hr><h2>The Government's Legal Theft Racket</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>

<P>
 
Think you've had a hard week? Consider what happened to Mrs. Tina 
Bennis back in October of 1988.  One day she finds out that her 
husband,  appropriately named John, was arrested by Detroit police for 
having sex in a car with a prostitute. Then a few days later, adding  
insult to injury, the city seized the car as a "public nuisance." And 
it didn't give it back, even though the car was half Tina's.
<p>
If that sounds a bit unfair to you, you'll be interested to know that 
this isn't just some aberrational Detroit statute like those laws you 
hear about forbidding eating cherry pie in the bathtub on Sunday or 
some such. Indeed, property forfeiture laws are routinely employed by 
states and localities around the country as well as by the federal 
government. 
<p>
Under the federal and most state civil asset forfeiture statutes, law 
enforcement officials can seize a person's property without a notice 
or hearing if they merely have probable cause to believe it has 
somehow been involved in a crime. Proceeding against the property, the 
government need not file criminal charges against the owner or anyone 
else.  
<p>
Because of the fiction that the property is guilty, not the owner, 
cases to retrieve forfeited items have such quaint names as One 1958 
Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania and United States v. 1960 Bags of 
Coffee. (No information available on whether Mrs. Olson was called to 
testify.)
<p>
"Involvement" may mean anything from a belief that the property is 
contraband to a belief that it represents the proceeds of crime (even 
if it is in the hands of someone not suspected of a crime), that it is 
an instrument of crime, or that it somehow facilitates crime.
<p>
In one famous case the oceanographic research vessel Atlantis was 
seized off the coast of Massachusetts because a single marijuana 
cigarette was found in the ship's crew quarters.  In another, 
authorities seized a Scripps Oceanographic Institute research vessel 
because a marijuana cigarette was found in the locker of a sailor who 
had long since been fired.
<p>
But it appears that most forfeiture victims are not big guys like 
Scripps who can afford attorneys to take back their property, but 
average Janes and Joes.
<p>
Using the Freedom of Information Act, the Michigan Association for the 
Preservation of Property found that in 1992 Michigan law enforcement 
agencies used civil forfeiture in 9,770 instances, confiscating an 
average of only $1,434 per seizure. Property taken included 54 private 
homes with an average value of only $15,991 and 807 cars with an 
average value of merely $1,412.  Poor Tina Bennis's car was worth only 
$660.
<p>
While these confiscations were probably crushing to those who suffered 
them, they are not enough to justify the thousands of dollars it would 
take to hire an attorney to get the property back.  You see, once the 
property is seized, the burden is upon the owner to prove its 
"innocence."
<p>
As Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) points out in his 1995 book Forfeiting Our 
Property Rights, "In more than 80 percent of asset forfeiture cases 
the property owner is not even charged with a crime yet the government 
officials can and usually do keep the seized property."
<p>
One of the most pernicious aspects of civil forfeiture law is that the 
property seized often benefits the seizer. During the Holy 
Inquisition, many a person went to his or her death because some 
official coveted their property. Unfortunately, that's not entirely a 
thing of the past as the Donald Scott case shows.
<p>
In 1992, federal, state, and local law enforcement officials raided 
Scott's Malibu home on his 200 acre ranch under the pretense that he 
might be growing marijuana.  Brandishing a gun to stave off what he 
thought were criminal intruders, he was shot to death.
<p>
In fact, Scott was passionately anti-drug. His "crime" may have been 
his repeated refusal to sell his scenic ranch to the National Park 
Service. The Ventura County district attorney concluded that "the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department was motivated, at least in part, 
by a desire to seize and forfeit the ranch for the government."
<p>
Civil forfeiture has allowed state and federal agencies to line their 
pockets with loot.  The amount deposited in the Department of 
Justice's Assets Forfeiture fund has increased from $27 million in 
1985 to $556 million in 1993. The Treasury Department's Forfeiture 
Fund took in $198 million in 1994.
<p>
Civil forfeiture needs to be seen for what it is, an end run around 
constitutional protections that begs for abuse. The notion that 
property can commit crimes is absurd. (Cars don't solicit prostitutes; 
people do.)
<p>
Forfeiture can be a valuable weapon in sucking the profits out of a 
criminal enterprise.  But the fair way to seize these is through 
something already on the books called criminal forfeiture. This 
procedure requires a criminal conviction before seizing property, 
eliminating much of the injustice of civil forfeiture.
<p>
True, this will eliminate those amusing case names like United States 
v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms. People who thumb through court 
reports in search of humor will just have to get their kicks some 
other way. We need to fight crime without taking the lives of Malibu 
millionaires or the clunkers of Detroit housewives.

<i>12/28/95</i><hr><h2>EPA Hides Behind Myths of Love Canal</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>

</center><hr>

<P>
It closes a chapter in what has been called "the nation's most 
notorious toxic dumping case." The Occidental Chemical Corporation has 
agreed to pay $129 million to cover the federal government's cleanup 
costs at Love Canal, New York. The problem is that the federal 
officials, who like all victors are the ones who write the history, 
have written a history that has little connection with reality.
<P>
Under the settlement, the EPA Superfund will receive $102 and the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency, which handled the relocation of 
Love Canal residents and initial cleanup, will receive $27 million. 
(Last year, Occidental agreed to pay New York $98 million toward the 
cleanup of the site. The state originally sought $630 million in 
damages.)
<P>
"Today we celebrate a transformation of an environmental disaster 
called Love Canal into a success story," Attorney General Janet Reno 
said at a press conference announcing the settlement. "It stands for 
the principle that when people make a mess, they should pay to clean 
it up." 
<P>
Hmm . . . Does that mean that Miss Reno is going to go to Waco, Texas 
and roll up her sleeves and start picking up debris?
<P>
Nobody questions that Occidental, or rather its predecessor, Hooker 
Chemicals & Plastics Corp., buried 22,000 tons of chemical waste in a 
half-dug canal from 1942 to 1953. Rarely mentioned, however is that 
Hooker tried desperately to convince the city of Niagara Falls (where 
Love Canal is located) not to build on the site.
<P>
As consumer advocate Eric Zuesse pointed out in a 1981 Reason magazine 
article, the city school board applied massive pressure to obtain the 
land despite Hooker's repeated warnings of potential health hazards.  
Finally Hooker gave in and sold the land for a symbolic dollar bill.  
It insisted, though, that the land was to be used for a school or 
parking lot or playground but was under no circumstances to be 
excavated.
<P>
Instead, the city decided to build a housing development on the site, 
digging into the protective clay covering and laying sewer lines 
through the waste.  Then it sold the plots to unsuspecting home 
buyers.
<P>
Hooker had no choice but to dump its toxic waste somewhere.  It was 
the city's choice to bring people to that somewhere. The bad guy 
wasn't the big faceless corporation, it was your friendly city 
government.
<P>
The second part of the Love Canal myth is that residents began 
suffering a health disaster in the late 1970s.  As I documented in my 
book Science Under Siege, nobody at Love Canal complained of any 
exceptional illnesses until a muckraking environmentalist reporter for 
the local paper began a series of articles telling the people that 
they were sitting on a toxic waste site.   Lo and behold, from then on 
every illness in the town was blamed on the ingredients brewing 
beneath the surface.  It even made national news when one family's dog 
began inexplicably vomiting.
<P>
The media descended upon the town and relayed to the outside world 
every sneeze, every cough, and every ache and pain experienced by Love 
Canal residents, making it clear that they could only be caused by 
toxic waste, which included the dreaded dioxin.
<P>
The EPA and the governor of New York swaggered around, condemning the 
chemical company and promising to make everything better, no matter 
the cost.  Ultimately tens of millions of dollars were spent 
evacuating the residents.
<P>
Only later did the truth begin to seep out. Study after study 
conducted by the federal government and the State of New York 
Department of Health found that Love Canal residents had no more 
illness than would be expected in any other area of similar size.  
Believe it or not, dogs who don't live on top of toxic waste dumps 
also vomit.
<P>
A New York Times editorial predicted correctly in 1981 when it said, 
"it may well turn out that the public suffered less from the chemicals 
there than from the hysteria generated by flimsy research 
irresponsibly handled."
<P>
Somehow, none of this was mentioned at the aforementioned press 
conference. Instead, EPA Administrator Carol Browner used the myths of 
Love Canal to blast congressional Republican efforts to cut back on 
enforcement of environmental laws. Love Canal led to the creation of 
the Superfund for the cleanup of environmental hazards.
<P>
In seeking to reduce environmental spending by $25 million, she said, 
"Congress is attempting to roll back the environmental health 
protections that Superfund brought to Love Canal." 
<P>
Since there was never any health threat at the Love Canal, obviously 
Superfund brought no protections there. In any case, it's too bad 
Browner didn't go farther to point out that Superfund, according to 
the Office of Technology Assessment, could soak up an amazing $500 
billion over the next few decades. While a few of these toxic waste 
<P>
sites may pose a real hazard to persons living nearby, most have posed 
no demonstrated threat as large even as making dogs upchuck.
<P>
Sometimes people fight back.  The citizens of Leadville, Colorado 
successfully fought the EPA's needless effort to scrape the lead out 
of Leadville's soil. (Anyone for "Ville" Colorado?). Like so much of 
what the EPA does, it was nothing but makework for a bloated and 
arrogant agency.

<center><h2>One Victim</h2>
 By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a> </center>
 <P>
 <hr>
 <P>
 

  
    Julie Welch, 23, didn't know that it was the last day of her life. 
She had plans for the future. She was preparing to quit her job as a 
claims agent for the Social Security department to take a job teaching 
Spanish at a local high school. 
<P>
     She was young and attractive. And, she was in love with a 
handsome, 24-year-old second lieutenant from a nearby Air Force base 
named Eric Hilz. They had talked about marriage, but that was still in 
the future. There was plenty of time -- they thought.
<P>
     The two had met at a Catholic prayer group for young adults at 
Tinker Air Force Base, according to news wire reports.  Last fall, on 
their first date, they went to the State Fair and rode the Ferris 
wheel. 
<P>
    On their final date, the Monday night before the Oklahoma City 
bombing, they went to dinner to celebrate Eric's 24th birthday. Julie 
gave him a prayer book, and they shared a bottle of champagne. The 
last time Eric saw her, after kissing her goodnight, she seemed happy, 
he said.
<P>
      Julie attended Mass every day, and went to Confession every 
week. She had a habit of praying the Rosary each evening, before going 
to bed. On the last night of her life, she probably didn't realize the 
full meaning of the words, "Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us 
sinners, now and at the hour of our death."
<P>
      She hadn't always been as ardent about her faith. Her father 
said she was lonely at college, and became depressed after living 
alone for the first time. That's when she started working on her 
relationship with God, praying daily, and frequenting the Sacraments. 
After graduation, she lost 40 pounds, and told her dad that she 
finally felt not only spiritually but physically fit.
<P>
     The morning of the Oklahoma City bombing, Julie attended the 7 
a.m. Mass at St. Charles, as always, before going to work at the 
federal building. 
<P>
     By 9 a.m., she was at her desk chatting with her supervisor. At 
9:02 she put down her glasses and went into the front office to greet 
her first customer of the day -- a Hispanic man who needed a 
disability check. 
<P>
     A moment later, the Social Security office was gone, demolished 
by a madman's bomb. About half of the 38 employees made it out alive, 
but not Julie.
<P>
     "She was too young," said her supervisor, Lorri McNiven, who woke 
up in darkness 30 minutes after the blast and was able to crawl from 
the twisted rubble to safety.
<P>
     Julie's parents got a call from the Coroner's office on Saturday 
morning. Their daughter's body had been identified. The grieving 
family said they considered themselves fortunate, because at least 
they can bury their child. Authorities say that some bodies were 
obliterated in the blast, and may never be recovered.
<P>
     To the world, Julie's life was unusual. Daily Mass, the Rosary, 
and weekly Confessions. She was happy, and at peace. It's not 
something the secular press can easily explain.
<P>
     At a time when the concept of womanhood has been redefined by the 
likes of Cosmopolitan Magazine to mean self-centeredness and self-
fulfillment, Julie was a contradiction.
<P>
      She kept her life God-centered, and wrapped herself in the 
Sacraments. She had her eyes on the ultimate prize: eternal happiness 
in Heaven.
<P>
     "We know there is no doubt her soul is in great shape. I feel a 
real sense of peace. I know everything is all right," her boyfriend, 
Eric, told reporters.

<center><h2>Fetal Tissue Consumption/Research</h2>
 By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley </a></center>
 <p>

 <P>
 

     News from the world of medicine: Chinese doctors think they have 
discovered something that cures asthma, restores health, and, at the 
same time, makes skin look years younger. 
<P>
     And, there's an abundant supply, which keeps the price down.
<P>
     Sounds too good to be true? Wait 'till you hear the rest. 
<P>
     The Eastern Express, an English-language newspaper in Hong Kong, 
broke the story on April 12, with details of the burgeoning practice 
of selling the bodies of aborted children, to be used as health food. 
Since then, the story has been picked up by the Wall Street Journal, 
the Washington Times, United Press International, and it's been shown 
on CNN. 
<P>
     Now, Republicans are demanding that the Clinton administration 
investigate, and they're planning to hold hearings in the House of 
Representatives.
<P>
     Rep. Frank R. Wolf, a Republican from Virginia, said the new 
allegations could result in a Congressional call for the United States 
to revoke "Most Favored Nation" trade status for China -- a privilege 
granted by President Clinton despite the manifold allegations of human 
rights abuses in China.
<P>
     This is a nauseating topic -- true. But it's a story that needs 
to be told, just as the shocking crimes of the Holocaust needed to be 
laid bare for the world to see.
<P>
     Zou Qin, 32, a doctor at the Luo Hu abortuary in Shenzhen, China, 
told the Eastern Express reporter that she has eaten more than 100 
fetuses in the past six months, and described them as "highly 
nutritious." The story included a picture of her holding a jar 
containing the tiny body of an aborted child.
<P>
     The doctor said: 
<P>
     "They are wasted if we don't eat them. The women who receive 
abortions here don't want the fetuses. Also, the fetuses are already 
dead (when we eat them). We don't carry out abortions just to eat the 
fetuses."
<P>
     Sound familiar? That's the same argument used by Sen. Ted 
Kennedy, Rep. Joseph Kennedy, and cohorts, to justify fetal research 
in America. 
<P>
     So, before you allow the shock to settle in, ask yourself: what's 
the difference? The Chinese are eating unborn children as health food. 
We're cannibalizing their body parts in the name of "science." 
<P>
     And, during the presidential campaign, Clinton used the same 
logic as Dr. Zou Qin, almost verbatim, when he was asked whether he 
supported experimenting on aborted humans. 
<P>
     They'd only go to waste, Clinton said. Fetal research is going to 
help people and relieve their suffering, he said. No one bothered to 
ask him: at what cost?
<P>
     In fact, one of Clinton's first acts after being sworn in as 
president was to revoke the ban on using tax dollars to fund fetal 
research. That's right: your hard-earned money is being used, right 
now, to pay for it.
<P>
     But, when fetal research is reported on the network news in 
America, it's with a positive spin. The film footage typically shows 
sufferers who allegedly have been restored to health after undergoing 
treatment that involved the injection of fetal brain cells into their 
damaged brains. 
<P>
     Not one word about the tiny human beings who were used, without 
their consent, as donors.
<P>
     Like the Chinese, scientists in America prefer older, more 
developed fetuses. The Eastern Express story reported that full-term 
fetuses were more desirable and more expensive in China -- because 
they were considered more nutritious.  
<P>
     In the world of Western medical research, mature fetuses are more 
desirable, too, because the organs are more developed. 
<P>
     There's one difference, though. The Chinese use dead babies. In 
America, some of the experimentation involves removing parts from live 
babies, before killing and aborting them. 
<P>
     If you have a hard time believing that, read the scientific 
papers that describe the procedures. Or, just ask yourself: would any 
doctor inject dead fetal brain cells into the brain of a Parkinson's 
sufferer? No. The brain cells have to be living, or they're no good.
<P>
     Could any dead fetal organs be used in medical experiments that 
involve transplantation into living adults? No. 
<P>
     Or, ask yourself: would any fetal body parts be usable after 
being subjected to a standard abortion procedure? Once again, the 
answer is, no.
<P>
     So, before we get on our high horse and start pointing at the 
Chinese in disgust, let's remember what we tolerate in America.
<P>
     In the end, the blame doesn't rest solely with the American 
researchers who do the grisly deeds. It also rests on the people who 
allow it to happen, by looking the other way.
<P>
     If you're inflamed by what's going on in China, take some of that 
indignation and use it to combat cannibalism on our own soil. Speak 
for those who have no voice.
<P>

<h2>When It Comes To School, Mother Knows Best </h2>
</center>
<hr>
<b>By Kathleen Howley</b>
<p>
I visited a friend recently, and was a bit surprised to see her nine- year-old son, Anthony, with his nose buried in a thick volume of Shakespeare's complete works.  
<p> 
"He's re-writing Hamlet in simpler language, and he's going to direct the play, with his sister and his cousins playing most of the parts," my friend explained.   
 <p>
Anthony looked up, for a moment, from his work.  
 <p>
"I'm going to be Hamlet," he said, with excitement.  
 <p>
But, of course. How silly of me to be even a bit surprised that a young boy's imagination would be captivated by the image of Hamlet -- the sword-wielding Prince of Denmark.  
 <p>
But, Shakespeare at nine? Or, even more astounding, a boy who voluntarily reads Shakespeare during his summer vacation?  
 <p>
My friend, who home schools both of her children, said Anthony was exposed to a bit of the classics as part of his English curriculum, and went galloping after the Bard on his own initiative during the school year.  
<p>
"It's nice that he has the freedom to really explore a subject that catches his interests," she said.  
 <p>
Other home schooling mothers have told me that their kids begin reading at an earlier age, and have a chance to learn in ways that fit their personalities. And, parents can choose a curriculum that gives their kids an education that emphasizes the basics, rather than the flavor-of-the-month approach to teaching.  
 <p>
Speaking as one who was interminably bored with the slow pace of the various public and Catholic schools I attended, I'm a bit jealous.  
 <p>
Home schooling is beginning to come of age. The U.S. Department of Education estimates that about 500,000 children -- more than one percent of all school-age children -- are schooled at home. Advocates place the figure at twice that. And, research shows that home schoolers are growing by as much as 40 percent a year -- fueled by the crumbing public school system, high tuition for private schools, and  
the increasing number of liberal Catholic schools that teach dissent to their young charges.  
<p>
Even the media is beginning to come around. Last October, Time Magazine ran a cover story that described the home schooling trend, albeit with a back-hand slap at Christians:  
<p>
"A movement once reserved largely for misanthropes, missionaries and religious fundamentalists now embraces such a range of families that it has become a mainstream alternative to regular public or private education," it stated.  
<p>
High profile examples, such as the Colfax family of Boonville, California, have helped to change the image of home schoolers. In 1987 Grant Colfax was accepted to Harvard University after being home schooled for his entire life. He graduated magna cum laude, became a Fulbright scholar, and graduated from Harvard Medical School. One-by-one, his home-schooled siblings followed in his footsteps to Harvard.   
 <p>
Advocates point to the fact that almost all of our early national leaders were home schooled. They'll tell you the kids get plenty of socialization, ranging from play groups where younger students mingle with other home-schooled children, to sports and theater groups for the older kids.  
<p>
What's more, in an age when family connections have never been weaker, they say that the one-on-one teaching inevitably strengthens the parent/child bond, and, as a result, imbues their kids with self-confidence and maturity.  
<p>
There is no doubt that home-schooled children have an academic  advantage over their group-schooled peers. In several studies over the last decade they score in the 65th to 80th percentile on standardized test. The national average is the 50th percentile.  
<p>
On the other hand, opponents such as the left-leaning National Education
Association, the union representing 2.2 million public school teachers, decry home schooling, saying it provides an "inadequate educational experience."  
<p>
In other words, no chance to tell the kids about condoms. No opportunity to show the students graphic pictures in their state-approved quest to promote sexual activity. No way to get the nihilistic message across that kids have no control over themselves.   
<p>
And, no opportunity to instill their version of values, meaning "yes" to recycling, and "no" to chastity, prudence, temperance, and faith.  
<p>
Do home-schooled kids miss out on something essential? Naw. I'd say it's the other way around.   
 <p>
It's the public school kids, who only get to be part of a family for the few hours between dinner and bedtime, who are missing out.

<title>Opus Dei</title>

<h2>Opus Dei</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<b>By Kathleen Howley </b>
<p> 
<p>
It has always puzzled me that Catholics who believe and accept the 
full teachings of the Catholic Church are labeled "Conservative" or 
"orthodox," while dissenting members who support, say, only two out of 
every 10 teachings -- on a good day -- are just called plain, old 
"Catholic." 
<p>
If anyone deserves an adjective, shouldn't it be those who reject the 
Christ-given Magisterial teaching authority of the Holy See? Shouldn't 
it be the ones who proudly declare their opposition to the Chair of 
Peter? 
<p>
Well, that's not the way it works in the 1990s. If all you do is 
support the basic teachings of the ancient faith -- not one iota more, 
nor one jot less -- sooner or later, you're gonna get a negative 
label.  
<p>
Thus, it's no surprise that the Chicago archdiocese announced in May 
that it would refuse to sell an unused college seminary to Opus Dei 
for a reported $8.75 million.  
<p>
Opus Dei, a canonically-approved Personal Prelature of the Church 
established by -- and widely praised by -- John Paul II, wanted to use 
the facility as the new site of Northridge Preparatory School, an all-
boys high school. 
<p>
Several archdiocesan groups voted to reject the sale because, in their 
words, Opus Dei is an elitist, secretive organization that has too 
much power in Rome -- you know, all the things that people used to say 
about the Jesuits.  
<p>
Months later, there are no other interested buyers. Like many disused 
Catholic facilities, the seminary may eventually be sold to an Eastern 
sect, or a New Age group. Or, perhaps it will be sub-divided as 
condos, with the chapel that was once used for the Holy Sacrifice of 
the Mass turned into a club house. Just as long as Opus Dei doesn't 
get it. 
<p>
Admittedly, Opus Dei has an image problem. Secular newspapers 
regularly run negative stories about it. Liberals in the Catholic 
Church disdain the world-wide group, founded almost 70 years ago by a 
Spanish priest beautified in 1992.  
<p>
Why? In part, because Opus Dei doesn't preach dissent, or New Age 
theology, or goddess worship. All it does is urge its mostly-lay 
members to grow in personal holiness, and to serve the Catholic Church 
as it wishes to be served. 
<p>
It's a novel concept, isn't it? Rather than following the current 
fashion of insisting upon serving Our Lord according to our own whims, 
they want to do things His way. 
<p>
Opus Dei, Latin for the "Work of God," shares some similarities with 
the much older, but lesser-known, Congregation of the Oratory, founded 
in the sixteenth century by St. Philip Neri. 
<p>
Both stick to the basics of the faith. Both are unwaveringly in their 
fidelity to the Roman Pontiff. And, both focus on giving the working 
man and woman the spiritual food they need to bring the light of 
Christ into the world -- namely, the Sacraments of the Catholic 
Church. 
<p>
And, in modern times, both have been persecuted, because of it. 
<p>
If you're looking for an example, read "The Last Roman Catholic?" by 
James Demers. He recounts the smear campaign that led up to the 1989 
expulsion of the Oratorians from the archdiocese of Ottawa, in Canada. 
<p>
The congregation was asked by Archbishop Joseph Plourde to take over a 
crumbling church in the poorest section of Ottawa. They started 
rebuilding the church, beginning with the Mass. No more ad-libbed 
Consecrations -- just the liturgy of the Roman Rite of the Catholic 
Church.  
<p>
Within six months, the pews of the church were filled with Catholics 
who traveled great distances to experience the reverence and piety of 
the Mass. A local choir was trained in the singing of Gregorian Chant 
and polyphony. Several doctrine classes began meeting regularly, and 
an architectural restoration project was underway. 
<p>
As you might imagine, the liberals who dominated the archdiocese were 
inflamed. They had been slogging away, day in and day out, with their 
faddish twists to the Mass and their voguish theology. But, the pews 
of their churches, and their parish collection boxes, were slowly 
emptying out. 
<p>
The Oratorians were labeled "ultra-conservative" -- even though their 
only crime was to preach the full wealth of the Catholic faith. They 
were called "divisive" -- despite the fact that their only concern was 
their Father's business -- hearing Confessions, celebrating Mass, and 
instructing their parishioners in the basics of the faith. 
<p>
Eventually, the church was taken away from them, and their 
parishioners set adrift. 
<p>
It's too bad that Catholic liberals are so intolerant. But, they are 
correct to fear both the Oratorians and Opus Dei. Any group that helps 
Catholic laypeople lead lives of old-fashioned sanctity ought to be 
dreaded by the church-busters on the left. 
<p>
For, such is the stuff that builds faith, and spawns strong Catholic 
families, with offspring who have sound vocations and deeply held 
convictions -- just the attributes that it will take to restore the 
Catholic Church in America and defeat the apostles of Modernism.

<h2>Walt Disney Co. - Porn pushers</h2>


By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a>
</center><p>
<hr>
<p>
Wall Street was dazzled by the recent $19 billion merger of Walt 
Disney Company and Capital Cities/ABC -- the second-largest take-over 
in history. 
<p>
Pundits said it was a good deal for the American entertainment 
industry. But, something tells me that 'ol Walt is rolling over in his 
grave.  
<p>
Not because ABC has a reputation for in-your-face bad taste. Yes, 
these are the people who gave us the jaw-dropping venom of Roseanne, 
and the steaming story lines of NYPD Blue, billed as television's 
first R-rated series. 
<p>
And, you'll notice that through it all, ABC continues to bill 
themselves as the "family station." 
<p>
But, the problem isn't with ABC. It's with Disney. 
<p>
When it comes to down-and-dirty porn pushers, you won't find many who 
have stooped as low as the Walt Disney Company has over the past year. 
<p>
No, I'm not talking about the R-rated anti-Catholic movie "Priest," 
described in one magazine as having "the best gay sex scenes in a non-
pornographic film."  
<p>
It's much worse than that. It's a movie called "Kids," recently 
released by Disney's wholly-owned subsidiary, Miramax -- the same 
people who gave us "Priest." 
<p>
It details the sexual experiences of 13- to 16-year-old New York 
teenagers. And, it's not a pretty picture.  
<p>
According to Reuters and the Associated Press, even a few hard-to-faze 
movie reviewers looked a bit taken aback as they left a pre-release 
showing at the Cannes film festival several months ago.  
<p>
One critic branded it "kiddie porn." The board who rates Hollywood 
movies agreed with him. 
<p>
They gave it an NC-17 rating, the new category that means not quite an 
X-rated movie, but almost. Miramax, fearing the stigma of an NC-17 
rating, chose to release the film unrated, which means it won't be 
running in as many theaters, but will still make the full rounds of 
video stores in its afterlife. 
<p>
The film opens with the main character, a promiscuous skateboarding 
teen named Telly, having sex with a 14-year-old girl. Later, he 
relates the entire scene in vulgar details to his buddy. As it turns 
out, seducing virgins is Telly's idea of "safe sex." 
<p>
It gets worse. Reviewers report that during a party sequence filled 
with explicit sex, a teenage girl passes out, high on drugs, and is 
raped by one of Telly's friends. 
<p>
Yes, that's right. This is the Walt Disney Company we're talking about 
-- the same people who created "101 Dalmations."  
<p>
Now, they've joined the lowest segment of the America media, intent on 
warping the minds of teenagers by linking sex with violence. 
<p>
"Kids" is showing in major cities across the country. And, it's a 
qualified hit. When it premiered, it broke the house records for 
weekend box office grosses at two New York City theaters.  
<p>
There have been a few naysayers, but most reviewers have been positive 
-- probably the same ones who praised "Priest."  
<p>
First-time director Larry Clark, 53, is getting plenty of media 
attention for "Kids." A July 26 profile in the New York Times 
reported: "The success of the film is allowing Mr. Clark to plan 
future movies."  
<p>
The profile doesn't mention Clark's well-documented background as a 
kiddie porn photographer. You have to read a publication such as the 
July issue of the "American Family Association Journal" to get the 
revolting details on that. (P.O. Drawer 2440, Tupelo, MS 38803) 
<p>
Clark is already talking about beginning his next film, which will 
focus on kids, sex, and suicide -- a theme that reoccurs in many of 
his porn photographs. He says he sees the new film as part two of a 
trilogy. 
<p>
So, why is Disney giving a platform to a psychopath? Because Clark's 
film is going to make money. That's why Disney dropped its standards 
almost a decade ago and began making R-rated films, hiding behind 
subsidiary companies. The long list of Disney-funded R-rated films 
seems tame, now, compared to their new ventures. 
<p>
Money. That's all that interests Disney chairman Michael Eisner, 
described by the New York Times as "one of the most ferociously 
ambitious people in Hollywood." 
<p>
Money enough to buy a television network, and create a media empire. 
Money enough to earn Eisner more than $10 million in salary and 
bonuses last year. 
<p>
Poor Mickey. Once, he was the most respectable mouse in the world. 
Now, he works for a porn pusher.

<title>UN World Conference on Women</title>

<center><h2>U.N. World Conference on Women</h2>
<p>
By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p>
Do you know the five genders? It's a widely-held tenet among 
radical feminists in America that there are at least five, if not 
more. And, they say, it's perfectly normal to flit between several of 
them during a course of a lifetime.
<p>
Typically, they are classified as: lesbian, male homosexual, 
transgender, and, for the less enlightened among us, male and female.
<p>
Geraldine Ferraro, the one-time Democratic vice-presidential 
candidate, is an ardent feminist and a radical pro-abort, yet she 
claims to have never heard about the new gender-speak -- despite the 
fact that it's standard fare in any run-of-the-mill college or 
university Women's Studies department.
<p>
Ferraro led the American delegation at the recent meeting to 
finalize the platform for the U.N.'s World Conference on Women in 
September -- where the definition of gender is guaranteed to be a 
ticking time bomb.
<p>
"I'm nearly 60 years old, and I don't know what the five genders 
are," said Ferraro, trying to deflect criticism about the feminist 
manipulation of the conference's lengthy draft statement.
<p>
In the official document, the word "gender" is mentioned more than 
200 times, often in a convoluted fashion, in sentences that beg for 
the use of the words "male and female." 
<p>
In fact, if you read the document, available on the Internet at 
the U.N. web site, it may raise the same suspicions that bothered 
delegates from Honduras, Guatemala and the Sudan. They were the first 
to object to the repetitive and somewhat odd use of the term, but 
later agreed to drop the issue until the main conference meets in 
Beijing.
<p>
You won't find the words "motherhood," "wife," or "family" 
mentioned in the official document, except for a handful of occasions, 
when they are referenced in a negative context as a means of 
oppressing women. 
<p>
Or, they've been put in brackets, which means that delegates 
objected to their use, and plan to remove them during the final 
revisions in Beijing.
<p>
The anti-fertility forces have had a spree during the drafting of 
the document. Abortion and the wide-spread use of dangerous chemical 
contraceptives, as well as sterilization, are held up, repeatedly, as 
among the most precious "rights" of women. 
<p>
Perhaps some day it will dawn on these meddlesome, middle-class, 
First World do-gooders that women from developing countries actually 
LIKE babies. I saw it with my own eyes, when I spent a year in West 
Africa.
<p>
They value new life. Not because it's another set of hands in the 
fields. But, because they believe that life is a precious gift -- and 
they don't have too many other bright spots in their difficult lives. 
<p>
I know such life-loving ideas are difficult for some First World 
brains to comprehend. We're always trying to think of new ways to 
relieve those poor women of the burden of motherhood. We, the minority 
of the world's population, believe that we know what's best for those 
underprivileged people who form the majority of the world's population 
-- in brief, we still believe in Colonialism.
<p>
But, they don't want our abortion clinics and our contraceptives. 
They want safe drinking water, simple drugs to help their children 
when they fall ill, and some economic opportunities for their 
families. 
<p>
And, there are many people in America who sympathize with them -- 
in fact, the majority. Sadly, the women from developing countries may 
never know this. 
<p>
Beverly LaHaye, president of Concerned Women for America, a 
conservative women's organization that is four times larger than the 
National Organization for Women, railed against the false image 
presented by the Clinton Administration's decision to send ultra-left 
Old Guard feminist extremists to Beijing..
<p>
"This conference is completely dominated by radical feminists. In 
the name of 'Equality, Development, and Peace,' this Beijing 
conference will be a taxpayer-funded promotion of abortion, 
lesbianism, and other left-wing crusades, such as disarmament, radical 
environmentalism, and socialism, that have nothing to do with helping 
women," she said.
<p>
We all know it's a travesty to hold a women's conference in a 
country that routinely practices forced abortions, mandatory 
sterilization of women, and female infanticide. It's a scandal to be 
the guest of a government that has a long record of imprisoning men 
and women in slave labor camps without trial, forcing them to make 
goods for export.
<p>
It's a joke to discuss the dignity of human beings in a country 
where possessing a Bible is a crime against the state, and where 
hundreds of Catholics priests have been imprisoned and tortured -- 
including three Catholic bishops who are still in prison, and three 
Catholic bishops who were tortured and beaten to death in 1991 and 
1992.
<p>
Yes, we know it's a travesty. But, the average woman in developing 
countries may not realize that the left-wing U.S. delegates do not 
speak for us. 
<p>
She'll be left to wonder about a world that sends her planeloads 
of contraceptives, but leaves her without access to simple anti-
malarial drugs.

<center><h2>Remembering V-J Day</center></h2>
<p>

<hr>
<p>
<p>
In all the controversy surrounding the 50th anniversary of the 
dropping of the atomic bomb on the weapons factories of Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki, there's been a bit of the human element that has been lost 
on one side of the debate.
<p>
No, I'm not talking about the fate of the 195,000 people who were 
killed or injured in those congested cities. Their tragic story has 
been told, as well it should. 
<p>
The world has not forgotten them.
<p>
But, what about the fate of the U.S. forces poised off the coast 
of Japan, ready to launch an invasion that was certain to produce the 
heaviest casualties of World War II?
<p>
It's easy, 50 years later, to disagree about projected fatality 
figures. Would there have been 80,000 American losses during the inch-
by-inch fighting for Japanese soil, or 180,000, or 300,000, or more? 
In recent weeks, the guests on the Sunday morning talk show seem to 
preen themselves as they dispassionately debate the issue. 
<p>
But, meanwhile, the men who were on those ships, and their 
families, have a different view of history. It's a more gripping sense 
of what might have been.
<p>
I know, because my father, Michael J. Howley, was part of that 
invasion force. He was, then, a somewhat-scrawny, 18-year-old Radarman 
First Class on the U.S.S. Akutan, an ammunition ship that was 
responsible for re-supplying the front-line battleships with shells 
and bullets. 
<p>
In the brutal, island-hopping campaigns that brought the U.S. 
forces to the shores of Japan, the Navy's job was to launch massive 
bombardments before each landing in an attempt to pave the way for the 
Marines. At the same time, the ships had to defend themselves against 
enemy fighter pilots and suicidal kamikaze attacks.
<p>
Dad enlisted in the Navy when he was 17, fresh out of Boston 
College High School. At first, his parents objected, saying he was too 
young. But, in the end, they signed the document required for under-
aged recruits, and sent their son to fight for their adopted country.
<p>
By August of 1945, he was a veteran of the Liberation of the 
Philippines, and, a more searing memory, the Battle of Okinawa, where 
the U.S. Navy experienced some of the heaviest losses of the war. 
<p>
He never had to worry about being crippled or maimed. All it took 
to incinerate an ammo ship was one well-placed bullet, or one 
successful kamikaze plane. 
<p>
In fact, in the final months of war, the U.S.S. Mt. Hood, also an 
"AE," or ammunition supplier, went down with all hands lost, with the 
exception of an officer and a squad of sailors who were on a nearby 
island. The explosion of the ship's 8,800 tons of bombs blew a 300-
foot-long crater in the ocean floor.
<p>
To acknowledge the awesome destructive power contained within the 
hulls of the AEs, the Navy named all of them, in the World War II 
years, after volcanoes.
<p>
When we were young, the only specifics Dad ever told us about the 
war were the funny stories, like the time he was on shore patrol and 
was ordered to arrest a group of sailors, who turned out to be his 
shipmates.
<p>
And, there was also the amusing detail about the "little white 
lie" he told his mother, who was home in Boston praying unending 
Rosaries for her two sons in uniform -- one, my uncle, in the Army, 
and, the other, my Dad.
<p>
"Mamie," an Irish name for "mother," spent the war years believing 
my father was on a low-level supply ship in the backwaters of the 
Pacific. To support this subterfuge, he filled his letters with 
imaginary details of how many blankets they had transported, and how 
bored he was.
<p>
"I didn't want her to worry more than she already did," he 
explained. 
<p>
Every year, at the anniversary of the bombings of Nagasaki and 
Hiroshima, the media focuses on one angle: the plight of the citizens 
of those two cities.
<p>
But the historical context, the backdrop for the decision to drop 
the bomb, seems to have been lost. 
<p>
There has been little mention of the fact that the Japanese were 
working on their own A-bomb, or that they had a habit of placing 
armament factories in residential areas, or that the citizens of 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were warned by U.S. leaflet drops to flee their 
homes, or that our prisoners of war were starving to death as they 
waited for liberation.
<p>
Most of all, we seem to have forgotten the plight of the thousands 
of soldiers and sailors -- many of them teenagers -- who waited 
onboard the ships of the American invasion fleet.
<p>
Whether you believe the lowball figures put forth by today's 
revisionists, or the higher figures accepted as fact in 1945, the 
bottom line is: vast numbers of those young men would not have 
survived the Battle of Japan.
<p>
They would have have missed their chance to live their lives, to 
have families, and to grow old.
<p>
Surely, their stories deserve some mention.

<title>Did My Parents Want Me</title>

<center>
<h2>Did My Parents WANT Me?</h2>
By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html">Kathleen Howley</a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
A woman, in her mid-40s, recently told me that she grew up with the 
feeling that her parents didn't want her.<p>  
She said she overheard, one night, a comment made by her mother, who 
didn't realize that little ears were listening. It referred to the 
conception of her daughter as being the result of "one drink too 
many." <p> 
It was meant as a joke. And, my friend reports that all the adults who 
heard it laughed. But she wasn't laughing.  <p>
In fact, that one comment, with perhaps, the subtle reinforcement of 
other stray remarks, haunted her for years. <p>
Oh, sure, her parents fed her and clothed her and sent her to school, 
and even went to "parent/teacher" nights -- the things that to all the 
world make people look like loving and caring parents. <p>
And, for all I know, they could have been exactly that. My friend 
wouldn't have disputed that possibility.  <p>
But, she wasn't talking about the love that almost any normal adult 
can learn to feel about a cute and cuddly baby.  <p>
She was talking about the deep-down questions that all children ponder 
as they learn about the world they live in:  <p>
When I was called into being, when I was created, did my parents WANT 
me? When I was thrust into this strange, new world, was there someone 
yearning for my arrival?  <p>
Somehow, if the answer to that question is , "Yes," it makes 
everything else easier. It covers a multitude of later lapses and 
human failings.  <p>
I suppose that it's much like arriving at the door of an important 
party knowing that you are an invited guest, as compared to walking 
toward the front steps without an invitation.  <p>
Of course, we all know that the most important Being of all, the 
Creator of the Universe, wanted each and every one of us to be born.  <p>
In fact, it's more than that. The Father not only loved us and called 
us into being. He also gave each of us a crucial job to do during our 
lifetime on earth -- a job that, whether great or small, is infinitely 
important in His plan. <p>
In adult life, that fact can be a great comfort. But, it seems that 
children need more.  <p>
Today, we live in a world that is ruled with a contraceptive 
mentality. It's a stingy philosophy that says, yes, children are a 
good thing, but only give me, at most, two of them. Any more than 
that, and they become a bad thing. <p>
How, I wonder, do today's children feel, growing up in a family with 
the knowledge that they barely made it under the wire. Just two. No 
more. We have no more love to give. <p>
Even if you're number one or two, you know that the love you receive 
from your parents is conditional. "We love you, because you happen to 
arrive when you did." <p>
Someone was ranting to me, recently, that people shouldn't have more 
than two children. <p>
I asked her: <p>
"Where do you fall in the birth order of your family?" <p>
She answered: <p>
"I'm the fourth child." <p>
Good thing her parents didn't agree with her ideas. Else, she never 
would have existed. <p>
I'm the second child in my family. Lucky me. I would have been born, 
even if my parents subscribed to a contraceptive mentality. Although, 
my little sisters would have been left out in the cold. <p>
Fortunately, I have the great gift of knowing that my parents wanted 
as many children as God would give them. That gave us Howley kids a 
jump start in life. We were wanted, yearned for, rejoiced over. Every 
one of us. <p>
But what about today's children, who live in families that have a 
stingy attitude toward life? Maybe God wanted more. Maybe He intended 
that third kid to be one who introduced the first kid to the woman he 
would marry, or got a job for kid number two when he got out of 
college. Or, maybe it was that fifth kid who was going to care for the 
parents when they were elderly. <p>
The fact is, it's not unconditional love for a couple to use chemicals 
to ensure that only one or two children are born. You can argue that 
it shows greater love to have just two children, and be able to 
provide them with every material asset. The best kindergarten, the 
best college.  <p>
Problem is, maybe they won't want to go to college. Maybe they'd 
prefer to have a brother, rather than a new car for their high school 
graduation. <p>
Mother Theresa said it best. In news accounts, she was quoted as 
saying, "In America, children have every material thing, but they are 
very lonely, because they don't have brothers or sisters to play 
with." <p>
So, when you have that third child, or fourth, or more, and people 
start raising eyebrows, asking, "How MANY are you going to have?" -- 
just answer, " I don't know, you'll have to ask God. He has a plan." <p>

<hr></center> 
<P>
 
The fat lady has yet to sing. With Democrats continuing to desert 
their party in droves, especially on the state level, the political 
drubbing that began with the November elections is going into extra 
innings. 
<P>
Almost every week, the newspapers carry stories of Democrats who have 
decided either to switch, or to quit. 
<P>
The political concept of Liberalism -- spelled with a capital "L" -- 
is dead, at least for this millennium. No longer will government 
simply give handouts as the solution to every problem. No longer can 
the media merrily assume to represent the views of all Americans when 
they postulate that freedom in America equals life without values. 
<P>
But, before Republican leaders get too euphoric about the all-out 
rout, it would be wise to remember that politics makes strange 
bedfellows.  
<P>
Some of their staunchest supports today are people who don't really 
fit into the Republican party, or the Democratic party. They are 
called: Catholic voters. 
<P>
 Of the 250 million people in America, 95 million, or two out of every 
five, are Roman Catholic. Sure, some of them have fallen away from the 
faith, for now -- after all, the Church has not been immune from the 
devastating effects of the "Just-Me" philosophy that hit society in 
the 1960s.  
<P>
 But, despite the biased polls you'll occasionally see in the 
newspapers, most remain firm supporters of Catholic teachings 
regarding the value of life and the family. 
<P>
 At the moment, the Republicans are best representing their views. 
Forty years ago, it was the Democrats. The mass of Catholic voters 
switched once. They can switch again. 
<P>
 Probably, that doesn't make too many Republicans quake in their 
boots. Of the two parties, they are the most pro-life, they'll tell 
you. They have the best ideas for restoring the strength of the 
family. They have a common-sense and value-based approach to 
education.  
<P>
 But, every once in a while, an issue comes along that makes the 
typical Catholic voter extremely ill-at-ease with the standard 
Republican party line. 
<P>
Immigration is one -- in a big way. Most Catholic voters are 
descendants of turn-of-the-century immigrants. True, it makes good 
sense to secure our borders and to crack down on illegal immigration -
- as long as that doesn't mean punishing the innocent children of 
illegals. 
<P>
 However, many Catholics will tell you that America must never close 
her doors to legal immigration, or develop a stingy attitude toward 
it, lest we lose our vigor and make a lie of the Statue of Liberty: 
"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breath 
free." 
<P>
 And, here's another issue: immoral labor practices. 
<P>
 No, I'm not going to hop on the media bandwagon and tell you that the 
big, bad Republicans only care about making a buck. I'm not going to 
even mention country clubs.  
<P>
 But, the fact is, the Republican party seems ever-ready to put the 
laborer at the mercy of the corporate decision-makers. If they want to 
hold on to their Catholic supporters, they are going to have to knock 
it off. 
<P>
  During recent months, the National Labor Committee in New York has 
sponsored a cross-country tour for two teenagers to tell the world of 
their experiences in the garment sweatshops of Honduras and El 
Savador, assembling high-priced clothes for The Gap, Banana Republic, 
Eddie Bauer, Sears, and Gitano, a subsidiary of Fruit of the Loom. 
<P>
  In these tax-free factories, built specifically to produce goods for 
the U.S. and Canadian markets, children and young women work shifts 
that sometimes exceed18 hours, for below-subsistence wages. The abuses 
they recount are mind-numbing. 
<P>
 Of course, the corporate bigwigs deny all of it. But, if you ask me 
who I'm going to believe -- Donald Fisher, who was paid more than $2 
million last year to run the Gap empire, or Judith Viera, an 18-year-
old who made 56 cents an hour and was limited to two bathroom trips a 
shift --- hummm....who would you believe? 
<P>
Judith, by the way, was fired when she tried to help organize a union. 
For good measure, the big boss also threw out her three sisters, just 
because they were related. 
<P>
 On her last 18-hour shift on the production line, Judith said they 
were sewing Eddie Bauer T-shirts. The crew included two workers who 
were only 15 years old. 
<P>
 Earlier this year, the House's Trade Subcommitee approved a bill 
introduced by Republican Phillip Crane to increase the tariff breaks 
for products entering the U.S. from sweatshops in the Central American 
and the Caribbean by $240 million.  
<P>
 Remember the giant sucking sound? H.R. 553 means it will only get 
louder, with more American companies being wooed by the prospects of 
33-cents-an-hour wages and laborers who are vulnerable to 
exploitation. 
<P>
 Currently, the bill has been set aside. But, seeing as Fruit of the 
Loom is a six-figure contributor to the RNC, and The Gap lags not far 
behind with a hefty five-figure donation, H.R. 553 may not be dead for 
long. 
<P>
 Yes, politics does make strange bedfellows, indeed.

<center><h2>You Must Learn To Forgive You</h2><p>
 By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a>
</center><hr><p> 
 

Only in this day and age could a magazine devote an entire, 2,600-word 
article to the subject of confession, and not once mention the word 
"God." <p>

Cosmopolitan did it, in their August issue. The gist of the story was: 
the highest aim in life is to obtain self-forgiveness. <p>

That's right. YOU must learn to forgive YOU. Confess your sins to 
yourself, or to a pal. No need to submit yourself to divine authority. 
Learn how to erase your guilt. Just get rid of it.  <p>

Silly you for feeling guilty in the first place.<p>  

Don't change your habits. Don't even consider the possibility that 
there is such a thing as absolute, immutable truth, or that some 
actions are intrinsically wrong -- or that feelings of actual guilt, 
as opposed to imagined or neurotic guilt, exist for a good reason. <p>

Don't ponder the idea that Hell could, indeed, be real, whether you 
believe in it or not. <p>

Just get to a good therapist, and work through your feelings.<p> 

I suppose that's a much easier route than asking for God's 
forgiveness, which requires an acknowledgment of His authority, true 
repentance, and an earnest resolution to try to sin no more. <p>

That would be life-changing. Earthshaking, in fact.  <p>

I'd wager a guess that the average Cosmo subscriber is nowhere near 
taking that first step. But, without God's absolution, they're just 
changing seats on the Titanic.<p> 

Forgiving yourself may, in fact, give temporary relief. But, until God 
forgives you, your deeds will always exist, if only in the deepest 
recesses of your mind, and, certainly, in your soul. <p>

Without His supernatural grace, dispensed through the Sacrament of 
Penance, they can never be cast "as far as the east is from the west." <p>

Sin, or "guilt," as Cosmo phrased it, "can torment you, make you sick 
-- even weaken your body's immune system." <p>

The article, titled "Are Guilty Secrets Haunting Your Life?" goes on: 
"People often become immobilized, whether they know it or not, unable 
to get on with their lives until they tell the truth." <p>

Ahh, is that all it takes? Having an honest chat with a friend, or 
spending $100 an hour for a therapist? Following Cosmo's logic, 
America should be the healthiest, happiest county in the world.  <p>

After all, is there any self-help route we haven't tried? Is there a 
new therapy technique we've passed up? <p>

Have we left anything unsaid? Is there any topic -- any? -- that 
hasn't been discussed in full detail on Oprah or other TV shows? <p>

And yet, America seems, on the whole, to be much more depressed, 
guilt-ridden, and lonely -- compared to, say, a time when we were a 
God-fearing country.<p> 

No. There's a lot more to healing the deadly effects of sin than just 
telling someone about it.<p>  

There's nothing wrong with therapy, or talking with friends. But 
neither will set us free.<p> 

Perhaps an easier way to explain this complex theological fact is with 
a simple story.<p>  

A man, troubled by his failings, confessed his sins to a Catholic 
priest, and received Sacramental absolution. Later, he spent time in 
prayer with God, and brought up the subject of his already-confessed 
sins.<p>  

The answer from God -- who, although all-knowing, may have been trying 
to make a point -- was, "I don't remember."<p> 

And, this gentle reminder was enough to give the penitent the feeling 
of elation that comes with true freedom. <p> 

I've felt that feeling too, as I've left a confessional. <p>

As Jesus told the Apostles: "Whose sins you shall forgive, they are 
forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained." 
(John 20:23) <p>

About six years ago, after I converted from being an atheist and a 
lapsed Catholic, I spent some time with a college friend who was not a 
believer.<p> 

She was quick to say that I seemed much happier since re-embracing the 
faith. But, she also said that she could never go back to being a 
Catholic because she couldn't stand living with "all that guilt." <p>

"Do I seem guilt-ridden?" I asked her. <p>

"No," she said.<p> 

"That's because the whole point is that Jesus died for our sins, in 
place of us. So, we get off scot-free. No guilt. All I have to do is 
try to live as He wants, and when I fail, I go to Confession, ask for 
His forgiveness, and I leave with a clean slate," I said.<p> 

"A clean slate..." she said, thoughtfully. "That sounds kinda nice." <p>

<title>Pope John Paul II Come to America -- Howley</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Pope John Paul II Comes to America </h2><p>
By<br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a>
</center><hr><p> 
 

The arrival of Pope John Paul II makes me think, with a chuckle, about 
the last time his plane, nicknamed "Shepherd One," touched down on 
American soil. <p>

It was at Stapleton International Airport, in Denver, for the 
celebration of the 1993 World Youth Day. Then, as now, President Bill 
Clinton waited to greet the pontiff, arriving via Air Force One less 
than an hour before the pope. <p>

I was in the area reserved for the pack of journalists covering the 
event. As we waited for the arrival of the pope's plane, I discussed 
the story with a reporter from a Boston television station.  <p>

She told me, in a confidential tone, "He's not going to discuss 
abortion. I have it from a very good source."  <p>

I knew her source. No need to even say it. It was our own Raymond 
Flynn, hizzhonor, "Raybo," the former mayor of Boston. Despite his 
assignment to Rome, as the Clinton-appointed U.S. ambassador to the 
Vatican, Flynn and his staff still kept up connections with the Boston 
press corps. <p>

Boston journalists fondly refer to the former mayor as "Raybo," 
referring to the time, while mayor, when he ran -- Rambo-like -- into 
a burning building and carried out an elderly woman. The joke at the 
time was: Boston politicians will do anything to ensure another vote. <p>

Most Boston journalists tended to like the mayor, then and now, 
because he had all the trappings of a Irish Catholic politicians, with 
none of the baggage. Meaning, he used his religion to wring every last 
vote out of the predominantly Catholic populace, in true James Michael 
Curley fashion, but, he didn't support Church teaching with his vote, 
in true Kennedy fashion. <p>

Hizzhonor claimed to be personally opposed to abortion, yet he did 
everything in his power to elect our pro-abortion President Bill 
Clinton, who couldn't have won the White House without the Catholic 
vote. Flynn criss-crossed the country for months before the election, 
tirelessly campaigning for Clinton. <p>

And, in his own backyard, Flynn did nothing -- zero -- during his 
lengthy tenure as Boston's mayor to stop the hundreds of abortions 
going on in Boston City Hospital, which was under his control.  <p>

I shook my head, doubtfully.  <p>

"Naw, I think he's going to mention abortion," I said. "I think Raybo 
may be engaging in a bit of wishful thinking, on that one." <p>

My fellow journalist was confident.  <p>

"Nope. It's not going to come up, at least in public. I'd bet my last 
dollar on that," she said. <p>

Well, you know the outcome. It took the Holy Father all of three 
minutes to bring up the subject. In his arrival speech, on the airport 
tarmac, he exhorted Americans to "Defend life!"  <p>

Flynn, who on that occasion was holding the umbrella to shield Bill 
Clinton from the rain, looked more and more downcast, as the speech 
wore on. <p>

"All the great causes that are yours today will have meaning only to 
the extent that you guarantee the right to life and protect the human 
person," the Holy Father said, emphatically. <p>

At the time, I actually felt a bit sorry for our ambassador to the 
Vatican, as he stood in the rain with a dejected look on his face. It 
seems he tried to work some behind-the-scene angle that didn't, in the 
end, prove to be fruitful. <p>

You'd think the American media would be used to it by now, and expect 
John Paul to speak strongly about the issues that threaten modern 
society. After all, the Holy Father has often used his speeches to 
label abortion as "murder." <p>

Shocking, isn't it? In the stultifying atmosphere of today's American 
culture, everyone is supposed to toe the line. Even the Conservatives 
aren't willing to take a risk by accurately describing what happens 
during an abortion, or by verbalizing the forces that lie at the root 
of our anti-life society. <p>

Those who try to defend the modern status quo have worked to convince 
Americans that "words kill" -- particularly when referring to 
abortion. Of course, America is built on the premise that only free 
and robust debate will ensure our liberty. But, in large part, the 
other side has convinced most citizens that speaking too strongly on 
any issue is somehow a danger to us all. <p>

Ironically, the opposite is true. In truth, silence kills. 
Historically, we've seen what happens, again and again, when good 
people stay quiet.  <p>

We can all take a lesson from the Holy Father, who during all of his 
previous 67 trips outside the Vatican has never hesitated to speak the 
truth, with love. <p>

He doesn't flinch when condemning such things as chemical 
contraception, sterilization, en-vitro fertilization, feminist 
extremism, and sex outside of marriage, to name but a few hot button 
issues.  <p>

When was the last time an American leader had the guts to lay it on 
the line, like that? <p>

<title>Rockwell: The Farm Trick Reform -- 04/17/96
</title>

<h2> The Farm Trick Reform
</h2>



Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
<p>

Hillary Clinton should have called her medical bill "Freedom 
To Heal." Then Congress might have passed it as restoring the 
free market in medicine. If you don't believe such a trick would 
have worked, take a look at the "Freedom To Farm" bill now 
sailing into law. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Official propaganda says this bill restores a free market in 
agriculture, ending 60 years of subsidies and planning. But ask 
yourself: if this were really true, wouldn't farmers on the dole, 
and the media, be in hysterics? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of course, and a close examination of the bill backs up this 
suspicion. The existing scheme, based on New Deal programs in 
turn modeled on the old Russian system, is retained in all its 
essentials. After this bill expires in seven years, the 1949 law 
that presently oppresses us will again be the law of the land. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Not that the new bill is salt peanuts. With a $47 billion 
price tag, it allocates even more money to subsidies initially, 
and to crazy new liberal programs. But in seven years, we're 
told, price supports and subsidies will be "phased out." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This farm bill is typical of a Congress that can't bring 
itself to cut a dime of federal spending, yet passes reams of 
"revolutionary" laws promising to cut, slash, abolish, and 
otherwise establish a libertarian Heaven on Earth...sometime in 
the next millennium. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But in the here and now, the bill retains price supports for 
peanuts and sugar, as well as price-fixing for milk. It renews a 
program locking up 36 million acres. And it throws away $1.4 
billion on more regulations, $200 million on a Florida swamp, and 
$300 million on "rural development." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

All in all, this bill could have been written by Bill 
Clinton, which is why he's glad to sign it. The Democrats 
particularly like the food stamp and school lunch provisions. 
Why, you may ask, are these part of a farm bill? Because those
who benefit, along with the "poor," are wealthy agribusinessmen.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Why this bill? Why now? Crop prices are at a ten-year high, 
and under the current subsidy formula, payments would be low. So, 
by merest happenstance, this bill changes the price-based system 
into a flat subsidy. Three to four billion dollars more will be 
spent for farm welfare immediately. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The bill's supporters say it eliminates many set asides, 
acreage controls, and crop mandates. But that would only be a 
glorious thing if the industry weren't subsidized and protected 
from competition. "Freedom to farm"--with other people's money.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The farm program is one of the oldest federal scandals. The troubles
began a century and half ago, when U.S. tariffs were set 
to favor industry at the expense of agriculture. The policy 
culminated in an invasion of the agricultural South by former 
industrial lobbyist Abe Lincoln. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Then, in the first world war, the federal government pumped 
up the price of wheat and other products, and after the war, 
tried to keep them that way. That effort failed, and after two 
devastating post-war downturns, officials sought more 
protectionism and outright planning. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By the time of the Great Depression, the Jeffersonian ideal 
of the independent yeoman farmer was banished. As president, 
Herbert Hoover set out to keep prices high by subsidies, trade 
restrictions, and planting controls at the very time when market 
pressures were forcing them to fall. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But Mr. Hoover was small potatoes compared to farm dictator 
Franklin D. Roosevelt. As he forced farmers to slaughter their 
hogs and plow under their crops in order to raise prices, he was 
also flooding some of the world's best farm land for the 
Tennessee Valley Authority. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The "brain trust" that gave us those policies still runs 
agriculture. The sector has become a virtual ward of the state, 
with the feds holding more than half of all farm debt. There are 
still independent farmers, and they avoid Washington like the 
boll weevil. Agriculture is dominated by subsidized agribusiness, 
its lobbyists, and its pet politicians. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The victims of food socialism are consumers and taxpayers, 
who shell out billions directly and in the form of artificially 
high prices every year. Also harmed are the remaining independent 
farmers, whose livelihoods are threatened by subsidized 
competition. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

That's why Congress should pass a real Freedom To Farm Act. 
It would abolish the whole of the existing system, and subject 
the sector to the same competition and price dictates that free 
industries face. Congress should also stop concocting tricky new 
ways to prop up big government with misnamed bills.

<title>Rockwell: Ending the Fed's Free Ride -- 04/09/96

<h2> Ending the Fed's Free Ride
</h2>
Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
<p>


Today's civics test: what Washington institution can make or  
break elections, bail out entire foreign governments, send the  
stock market to the stratosphere, or bankrupt whole industries,  
yet operates with less oversight than even the CIA?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


One hint: the U.S. Constitution is useless as a cheat sheet  
(as it would be for any realistic civics exam these days.) The 
answer is the Federal Reserve, the most powerful yet least  
questioned any D.C. bureaucracy. Will that soon change?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


At issue is a new report on the Fed, released by Government  
Accounting Office just as Alan Greenspan seeks Senate  
confirmation for his third term. The report pulled back the  
curtain, just a smidgen, on the Fed's notorious secrecy. Now some  
Senators and pressure groups are gearing up to give the Fed the  
what-for.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Among other revelations in the report is the Fed's  
heretofore secret "contingency fund"--that is, slush  
fund--totaling $3.7 billion. It comes from money that the Fed has  
skimmed off the revenues gained from its open-market operations.  
Everyone thought revenues were turned over to the Treasury.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


And that's far from the only slush sluicing through the  
halls of the Fed's marble temple on Constitution Ave. From 1988  
to 1994, the Fed's spending on its own lifestyle grew at twice  
the rate of inflation.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Mr. Greenspan protests the suggestion that the Fed is  
wasting taxpayer dollars. He's technically right. The Fed doesn't  
need our taxes any more than a counterfeiter needs to hold up the  
local gas station. The central bank using fancy finance to  
effectively print all the money it needs.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In its never-ending quest to expand money and credit, the  
Fed can lower the rate it charges member banks for loans, it can  
manipulate reserve requirements, or, most notoriously, it can buy  
Treasury securities on the open market.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


It's this last action that proves so profitable. The Fed  
purchases Treasury securities--either directly or through  
favorite brokerage houses--and holds this debt as an asset.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Working through its branches and member banks, it pyramids  
loans on top of these securities. The creditworthiness of the  
U.S. government--whose balance sheet would otherwise suggest  
Chapter 7--is entirely due to this power of the Fed.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The real oddity--and this is where the power to counterfeit  
comes in--is where the Fed gets the money to purchase these debt  
securities. It creates it out of thin air, a magic trick made  
easier as the current paper money system replaced the restrictive gold 
standard.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


If anyone tries this at home, the Justice Department lands  
him in the pokey. When third-world countries are rumored to be  
circulating phony dollars, the military threatens to bomb them.  
To stop counterfeiting is why the Treasury says it redesigned the  
$100 bill. It could also be cracking down on the competition.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Now to the Fed's just-discovered $3.7 billion slush fund. It  
represents a small slice of the profits the Fed derives from  
exacting interest payments on the debt it holds. And who pays  
that interest? You and me, in the form of tax dollars. At the end  
of the year, the Fed gives some back and keeps the rest.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The original argument for creating the Fed is that it would  
eliminate banking crises that cause bank depositors to lose their  
money. Well, after 1913, the recessions increased in frequency,  
the government became vastly bigger, and the dollar lost about 97  
percent of its value. In one way or another, depositors have lost  
more money than ever.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The Fed's fingerprints are all over these trends. Every new  
dollar created by the Fed's operations (all else being equal)  
waters down the value of the existing dollars circulating in the  
economy. And an ever-cheaper dollar redistributes money from  
savers to debtors, and from the tax-paying middle class to the  
banks and government contractors that spend the fresh money  
before prices rise.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


We hear that inflation is low, but look at the long-term  
trends. The dollar has lost three quarters of its value since  
Richard Nixon eliminated the last vestiges of the gold standard 
in 1971. Even at the present rate of inflation--and who believes  
that will last?--overall prices will have doubled when today's  
newborns enter the workforce.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


If we want to know why living standards are falling, the  
curtain needs to be pulled back even more. If we want to stop the  
fall, we need a truly redesigned money: a Fed-proof gold dollar.

<title>Rockwell: The Standard Bearer Returns -- 04/16/96

<h2> The Standard Bearer Returns
</h2>
Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
<p>

Taxpayers, it's no time to despair. The anti-government   
revolt that swept the Democrats out of power in Congress is still   
on. But in the newest twist, the revolt has exposed the   
Republican establishment's own compromises with government power.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The evidence comes from a dramatic political contest in the  
14th district of Texas. Former Congressman and intellectual  
firebrand Ron Paul won the Republican runoff for the House seat  
currently held by party switcher Greg Laughlin. The results have  
sent shock waves through Republican ruling circles.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Though a Democrat only yesterday, Mr. Laughlin had money,  
media access, the endorsement of the Republican elite, and the  
use of the party's biggest guns. Dr. Paul, in contrast, was the  
outsider who gained a stunning 9-point victory by stressing his  
independence, ideals, and pristine record.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In Washington, the race became a loyalty test. The House  
leadership prevailed upon 53 high-ranking Congressmen to send  
contributions to the Laughlin campaign. The party dispatched its  
own ample funds, along with Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay, the two  
George Bushes, and even Reagan-era leftover Ed Meese.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


But bigshots couldn't muscle the voters in this largely   
rural district. The endorsements only confirmed Dr. Paul's claim   
not to be part of any machine. In fact, Phil Gramm's ads for the   
Laughlin campaign had to be pulled when they began to backfire.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
The Laughlin strategy assumed, without evidence, that voters   
trust the Republican leadership to tell them how to vote. But the   
bloom was already off that rose. Republicans have run Congress   
for more than a year, and taxes are still high, spending is   
higher, living standards continue to fall, and our liberties are   
just as imperiled.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


When Mr. Laughlin switched from the Democrat Party, the   
Republican leadership put him on the Ways and Means Committee,  
the best seat in the House for buying and selling special favors.   
But an insider deal couldn't erase Mr. Laughlin's voting record,   
which was Clintonesque to the core. His switch was not   
ideological, of course, but political. Throw in the  Roll Call    
scoop that he is Washington's number one junket taker, and he   
became the personification of double-dealing politics.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

  
The party claimed to support Mr. Laughlin because it wanted   
to show that converts can win elections. But that doesn't explain   
the timing. The switch occurred only after Dr. Paul told the   
House leadership of his intention to run. The deeper truth is   
that the leadership wanted to keep Dr. Paul and his   
uncompromising approach at bay.     
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Dr. Paul's voting record is a portrait of courage and of   
unshakable devotion to liberty. He worked against taxes,   
spending, foreign wars, and pork-barrel projects, even in his own   
district. In the ratings of the National Taxpayers Union, he   
holds the all-time highest score.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
When he was in Congress before, Dr. Paul never hesitated to   
buck the party leadership and vote against its hidden tax   
increases and unbalanced budgets. He tossed special interest   
groups out of his office. And he resisted personal pressure from   
Ronald Reagan to vote for IMF subsidies and military pork.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Dr. Paul was the first politician in this century to   
introduce term-limits legislation, not just for politicians, but   
also for federal judges and bureaucrats. He was the first to call   
for the abolition of Congressional pensions, and refused to take   
part in that giveaway. He was the first to call for the BATF to   
be abolished. And thanks to his efforts on behalf of the gold   
standard, the U.S. now mints the best-looking gold coins in the   
world.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
He is an eloquent spokesman for states rights and individual   
liberties against federal intrusion, for sound money against   
inflation and other Fed manipulations, and for self government   
against centralized power. His foreign policy views are those of   
George Washington: trade with all and belligerence toward none.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Dr. Paul combines his idealistic political philosophy with   
an impressive technical knowledge of economics. He is an exponent   
of the Austrian School, and knows more about such subjects as   
business cycles and central banking than most working economists   
and any sitting member of Congress.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


As a physician who has brought more than 4,000 babies into   
the world, he also knows that the biggest enemy the family has is   
our declining economy, thanks to excessive taxes and regulations.   
He knows that the government is also to blame for our failing   
educational system.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In his fight, Dr. Paul forged a coalition that included the   
religious right, economic libertarians, home schoolers, gun   
owners, land owners, businessmen, and anti-war isolationists.   
That is, people who want to be left alone by the government.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Ron Paul faces another hurdle in the general election. But   
if he makes it, he will once again be big government's biggest   
enemy in Washington. No wonder Republican power elites,   
especially those whose actions belie their rhetoric, are worried.

<title>Rockwell: "Public Sector" Racket -- 04/21/96
</title>
</head>

<h2>"Public Sector" Racket 
</h2>
Llewellyn Rockwell
<P>


The term "public sector" is highly misleading. It's supposed  
to refer to the government, that well-known public servant, in  
contrast to the "private sector," the greedy and selfish market.  

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
But the opposite is the case. In the "private sector," all  
activity is focussed on serving the public, people helping people  
get quality goods and services at the best price. A business that  
loses sight of its consumers is quickly outcompeted by one that  
serves the public better. The market is the true public sector.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

On the other hand, government is obsessively focussed on  
itself and its private, internal, bureaucratic interests. It  
doesn't engage in productive enterprise, there are no regular  
consumers of its "services," it is owned by no one in particular,  
and it doesn't worry about profit and loss.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Government's primary if not exclusive function is to  
redistribute wealth from one group to another by force. The  
people, the very ones involuntarily funding the government, are  
seen as chumps and menaces, and used as pawns in social  
experiments and power grabs. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

All this comes clear when you compare the way any private  
company works with, say, the Department of Housing and Urban  
Development. In the most recent outrage, HUD decided it should  
blow up its housing projects in downtown Baltimore and move the  
residents to pricey homes in the suburbs, at fantastic taxpayer  
expense. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This demented scheme--which will drive down property values,  
increase crime, and unsettle whole communities--is at war with  
the public interest. That's why it's generated an explosion of  
resistance among homeowners in the Baltimore area. Especially  
peeved are new suburbanites, who worked hard to get away from the  
inner city.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Just who benefits from this scheme? Power-mad bureaucrats  
who see their mandate as tearing up the social pea patch, and the  
contractors and social workers who live off the ensuing  
destruction. These are private, not public, interests.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The market, in contrast, is the peaceful and fully  
accountable public servant. Capitalists produce houses and  
apartments for every social group. If we were sticklers in our 
use of language, we would call what the market achieves "public  
housing," since its purpose is not to destroy, but to create  
housing options for everyone at the least possible expense.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Here's another example. Which is more anxious to serve the  
public: the government's mail operation, or the myriad of private  
delivery services? You don't have to be an expert to know. UPS 
and Fedex men toil with packages piled high, racing from place to  
place, competing to provide ever better service.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. Postal Service is so bad that it changed its name  
(it used to be Post Office) and logo (from a mailbox to an  
eagle's head) to avoid ridicule. The service gets worse (I'm old  
enough to remember twice-daily delivery), the price always goes  
up (especially on business), and the whining never stops. Can we 
imagine Fedex employees complaining about too much business, as  
the postal people do during the Christmas season?   
  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

No, public service is not the Postal Service's strength. But  
it has mastered the art of lobbying. That's why, despite the  
blather about being "revolutionary," this Congress hasn't even  
considered repealing the unamerican laws that prohibit  
first-class mail competition.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Like all government bureaucracies, the Postal Service has no  
real owners, and most of its "customers" have no choice. The  
offices are so unpleasant that one of last year's best performing  
stocks was a company that takes your letters and packages to the  
P.O. so you don't have to.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

So the Postal Service blows millions on ads designed to  
bamboozle. One new campaign claims it's "a very businesslike  
business." Why? Because it's so big, the 33rd largest "company"  
in the world, having moved up a notch after the Politburo was  
downsized.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the government claims that its private interests  
are really the public interest, it is busy destroying private  
industries that truly do serve the public. If the Justice  
Department brings suit against a business for "discriminating"  
against some privileged group, for example, it's as good as dead.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Worse, Congress has called on the nation's tax-collecting  
public servants to share their jobs with non-government lawyers,  
so they can scarf up more private revenue. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thanks to this perverse "privatization," a private-sector  
profession will be paid by a public-sector agency to loot private  
property for the private interests of phony public servants. Oh,  
for those simpler, better days before government ruined our  
language.

<title>Rockwell: China: Trade Yes, Aid No  -- 4/22/96

<h2> China: Trade Yes, Aid No 
</h2>



<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.</a>
<p>
What's so difficult about China? The political class seems  
intent on reviving the Cold War, but every issue before us can be  
solved by a quick reflection on the basic principles of classical  
liberalism, which happen to coincide with America's traditions as  
well as common sense. The rule with China, as with every other  
country, should be this simple: trade, not aid.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The trouble with Most Favored Nation status is that it  
conflates the two categories. It gives the recipient access to  
our markets and ours to theirs, with low tariffs both ways, which  
is as it should be. However, it also makes MFN governments  
eligible for grants, loans, and guarantees from the World Bank  
and the International Monetary Fund. Those are indirectly and  
primarily funded by U.S. taxpayers.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Have these grants and loans ever done any good in the long  
run? There's not a single case. Rich countries have gotten along  
without them just fine. Poor countries get strapped with debt,  
and have to accept the policy terms of the lending agencies. More  
often than not, that means Keynesian-style fiscal policy, heavy  
regulation, laborious labor laws, and tax increases. That is not  
a recipe for prosperity.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So by all means, end aid from these agencies to China, and 
everywhere else. At the same time, there is no good reason to  
impose trade sanctions. They merely restrict the rights of  
American consumers and producers to buy and sell in the most  
favorable places. If that's France and Germany, fine. If it's  
China and Cuba, that's fine too. With the Cold War over, it's  
time to separate economic policy and foreign policy.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That the political class is suddenly ganging up on China is  
particularly ironic. Here's a communist government that has  
liberalized its economy to a striking degree. More trade will  
push the process further, and might even ensure some measure of  
political liberalization as well.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Yet the litany of reasons why China should be considered a  
"rogue state" grows ever longer. Its government squelches civil  
liberties. It doesn't enforce U.S. property rights. It encourages  
abortion. It threatens its neighbors. Bad, bad, China.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But by those standards, the U.S. government looks pretty  
roguish too. Federal police agencies are no well-known respecters  
of human rights. As for property rights, they took quite a  
beating on April 15 this year. The U.S. government routinely  
engages in land seizures in the name swamp protection, and it  
promotes abortion with tax dollars.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Is this, to use Cold War language, the horrible practice of  
seeing a "moral equivalence" between U.S. democratic and foreign 
authoritarian ones? Not at all. As Americans, we have  
a moral obligation to concentrate on the beam in our eye, not the  
splinter in someone else's.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The biggest problem is hypocrisy. We not only trade with,  
but give massive aid to, governments around the world that  
mistreat their own people, kill innocents outside their borders,  
and refuse to recognize even rudimentary liberties. Why single  
out China?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
China may tolerate the copying of films and compact discs.  
The question is: why should American consumers be denied access  
to goods from China because American exporters are unhappy with  
Chinese copyright laws? It is the business of U.S. exporters, not  
the U.S. government, to protect overseas profits.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
All of this flows from a simple proposition, the very basis  
of the free enterprise system: economics is the business of  
business, not government. If the U.S. government has any role, it  
is to protect life, liberty, and property here at home. Forcing  
exports on others, punishing evildoers abroad, or centrally  
planning the world trading system only invites trouble.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But isn't China threatening Taiwan, and isn't that grounds  
to wage a trade war? We only started hearing about the grave  
threat to Taiwan a few weeks before the Taiwanese ruling party  
was up for reelection. The central point in its platform is that  
China is a grave threat. Is it? If holding war games off its own  
shores is a hostile act, what about U.S. war games with Japan and  
Korea off China? Indeed, on the threatening of small countries by  
big ones, Panama, Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and the Dominican  
Republic might have something to say.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But let's assume China is planning an invasion of Taiwan,  
highly improbable given the relative balance of military power.  
What then? As regrettable as that might be, the U.S. cannot  
guarantee every State Department-approved border in the world.  
Let Taiwan provide for its own security, as it has amply done. It  
is not up to Americans to be taxed, or die, for foreign regimes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last time the West tried to force its dominion and  
products on China, the issue was opium, and it led to vast  
unrest, the overthrow of the monarchy, and the eventual communist  
takeover. That brings us to another principle derived from the  
classical-liberal tradition: we cannot fully anticipate the bad  
consequences of government intervention, so we ought to prevent  
it where we can.

<h2>
Pat Buchanan's 'Old Right" Opposed Tariffs
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>
 
What kind of conservative is Pat Buchanan? Supporters and  
opponents say that he's bringing back an older tradition, which  
rejects the cosmopolitanism of the National Review 
generation, and hearkens back to the "isolationism" and America  
First movement of the 30s and 40s.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Mr. Buchanan doesn't dispute this, and why should he? The  
Old Right, though widely misunderstood, was a principled band of  
intellectuals and activists, many of them libertarians, who  
fought the "industrial regimentation" of the New Deal, and were  
the first to note that, in America, statism and corporativism are  
inseparable.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unfortunately, despite an otherwise appealing platform, Mr.  
Buchanan doesn't represent Old Right economic ideals. These  
writers ardently defended capitalism, including big business and  
corporations, celebrated the profit motive, and took a strict  
laissez-faire attitude toward international trade. They loathed  
tariffs, and saw protectionism as a species of socialist  
planning.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Frank Chodorov was a central intellectual figure on the  
Right from the 1920s to the 1950s, editing the early Freeman 
magazine and founding Human Events and the Intercollegiate  
Studies Institute. A prolific writer, Chodorov guided two  
generations of students and activists to the literature of  
liberty, and urged no compromise with the central state.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

He proudly wore the label "isolationist" and, like Mr.  
Buchanan today, saw entry into the two world wars as a mistake  
because they bolstered militarism and big government in America.  
To Chodorov, isolationism was "not a political policy," but the  
proper and "natural attitude." People are rightly concerned with  
family and neighbors, he said, not foreign peoples and their  
troubles. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But, as he made clear, Chodorov's isolationism had nothing  
to do with international economics. Free trade with other nations  
is part of the normal working of the economy, which stems from  
being concerned with the well being of our families. Chodorov was  
aghast and angered when some people tried to make "America First"  
mean "Buy American": that is, "economic, rather than political,  
isolationism."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Economic isolationism--tariffs, quotas, embargoes, and  
general governmental interference with international trade--is an  
irritant that can well lead to war," he wrote. "To build a trade  
wall around a country is to invite reprisals," and generates  
"misunderstanding and mistrust." To Chodorov, "Free trade is  
natural, protectionism is political."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

T. Flynn, the great journalist and leader of the  
America First Committee, agreed with Chodorov. "The last seventy  
years of American history," he wrote in 1944, "have been a struggle 
between the ideal of free enterprise and the determination to restrain 
and regiment it." Business "comprises the whole immense web of 
producing and distributing enterprises," but tragically, "some men, 
for various reasons, set out to interfere in the natural workings of 
this immense organism."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn condemns domestic industrial planning because it leads  
to trade barriers. "The first condition of a planned economy is  
that it shall be a closed economy," he wrote. That's why  
socialists want "an impenetrable wall around" the nation,  
"keeping out everybody and every kind of goods and striving for a  
complete self-sufficiency. Of course, this is not practical  
anywhere."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Though a nationalist, Flynn understood the difference  
between caring about one's country first and trade restriction,  
which he saw as having a socialist and fascist pedigree. The link  
between protection and planning, he pointed out, was not disputed  
even on the left. To Stuart Chase, the New Dealer who coined the  
term, "national planning and economic nationalism must go  
together or not at all."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn's view, toughened with a right-wing anarchist edge,  
was also that of Albert Jay Nock, the social critic who inspired  
several generations with his biting attacks on collectivism,  
egalitarianism, and modernity. As a writer for Harper's, he  
helped make anti-statism the political center of pre-war American  
conservatism.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

He too was against entering any foreign war, and could thus  
be fairly described as an "isolationist." But protectionist? "We  
all now know pretty well," he wrote in 1935, "that the primary  
reason for a tariff is that it enables the exploitation of the  
domestic consumer by a process indistinguishable from sheer  
robbery."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"By putting a tariff against the importation, say, of wool,  
the State permits the domestic wool-producing interests to levy a  
tax upon consumers of wool to the amount of the excess in price  
over the price determined by supply and demand in a free  
competitive market. These interests give the consumer nothing in  
return for the tax; the State gives them as beneficiaries, the  
privilege of levying it, and they accordingly do so."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Felix Morley was more of a traditionalist. He won the hearts  
of conservatives by defecting as editor of the Washington  
Post and later becoming editor of Human Events, as well as  
the author of brilliant books on federalism and foreign policy. 
He was an America Firster, an isolationist, and a right-wing  
populist to boot.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But when it came to free enterprise, there was no  
compromise: it must not stop at the border. "Unrestricted  
competition is essential to economic freedom," he wrote. "Indeed,  
it can be said that competition is freedom, as distinct from  
the personal attribute of liberty." "It follows that in an  
advancing civilization the objective with regard to the market will 
always be the removal of restrictions to trade."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This is why Morley doubted that businessmen would be the  
best defenders of the market. They too often seek to protect  
themselves from competition in the name of free enterprise. "Time  
and again," he wrote, "those who argued for competition have, in  
practice, leaned toward monopolistic operations. Advocates of the  
free market have worked openly and surreptitiously for high  
tariffs and other governmental favors." As an example, he cites  
the industrial protectionism of the 19th century that Mr.  
Buchanan now praises.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The preeminent economic theorist of the Old Right was Henry  
Hazlitt. Kicked out of The Nation because he opposed FDR's  
National Recovery Act, he was made editor of The American  
Mercury by H.L. Mencken. During the heyday of Keynesianism,  
Hazlitt thrilled the free-market right with his editorials in  
Newsweek. He was also second to none in his hatred of all  
forms of government intervention, including protectionism and  
economic nationalism.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Hazlitt's Economics In One Lesson, still in print after  
fifty years, devotes two chapters to the tissue of fallacies that  
is the case for protectionism and subsidized exports. As Hazlitt  
demonstrates, "The tariff--though it may increase wages above  
what they would have been in the protected industries--must on  
net balance, when all occupations are considered, reduce real  
wages." As a friend of Ludwig von Mises and F.A. von Hayek,  
however, Hazlitt might be considered one of "those damned  
Austrian economists" that Mr. Buchanan warns us against reading.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There were Old Rightists who worried about free  
international trade, but not on Buchananite grounds. Essayist  
Garet Garrett came to favor closed borders because he worried  
about the war potential of forcing foreign consumers to buy  
American products, another policy Mr. Buchanan favors. At the  
same time, big business never had a greater champion than  
Garrett. A biographer rightly called him "Profit's Prophet."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Whatever can be said of Mr. Buchanan's trade theories, they  
are not those of the Old Right. Their intellectual legacy is more  
likely British mercantilism, and that's one import we can do  
without.  
<BR>

<h2>
Hillary's Revenge
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

Hillary Clinton has won a victory in the Senate. The  
Senate's health care bill, which passed unanimously, is not as  
flashy and detailed as her failed legislation. But the central  
principle is the same: the government, one way or another, should  
guarantee health care to everyone.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Recall that Mrs. Clinton found herself on the receiving end  
of a propaganda blitz. She was denounced as a Marxist who wanted  
to centrally plan the economy, destroy small business, and take  
away freedom of choice.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This was sweet music to lovers of free enterprise. Was the  
Republican Party, which in the past has backed big government  
medical reforms, at last making principled arguments? Corporate,  
medical, and insurance lobbies--also soft on government  
intervention--even joined in the attack.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
People and publications not usually prone to criticize  
statism sounded like libertarian purists. Even the New Republic  
ran a detailed, point-by-point attack on the White House plan.  
Thanks to these efforts, we were spared a nightmarish plot to  
nationalize one-seventh of the economy.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And yet, ominously, several provisions--some of the most  
socialistic ones in the Clinton plan--escaped deep criticism. For  
example, insurance companies would be forbidden from refusing, or  
charging higher premiums for, customers who would drive them to  
bankruptcy. That is, insurers could not take account of  
"preexisting conditions," as the lingo has it.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zoom forward one year. This provision ends up as the core of  
the Republican health care bill. If automotive or housing  
insurance couldn't "discriminate," costs would zoom and clients  
would have less of an incentive to care for their property. So  
too will this rule destroy the character of insurance in the  
medical industry.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Real insurance relies on actuarial tables, premiums that  
reflect risk (adjusted for any reason), and carefully grouped  
risk pools. A fat, cigar-smoking coach potato will have higher  
premiums than a member of the high-school swim team. If it is  
illegal to make a distinction, it's not business but welfare.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So title I, section 101 of this bill calls for "Guaranteed  
Availability of Health Coverage." Group health plans "may not  
establish eligibility, continuation, enrollment, or contributions  
requirements" based on "health status, medical condition, claims  
experience, receipt of health care, medical history, evidence of  
insurability, or disability of a participants or beneficiary." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is an insurance company supposed to do if it can't  
assess the risk? Just dish out the big bucks. But can an insurer  
discreetly avoid certain professions based on their preponderance  
of sick employees? Nope: an insurance company "may not decline to" 
insure a person or group that demands it.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In this system, insurance companies cease to be market  
operations, working on the basis of profit and loss, and instead  
become middlemen in a socialist enterprise. But the Senate will  
take socialism only so far: pregnancy, unlike AIDS and other  
sexually transmitted diseases, is expressly excluded as a  
"pre-existing condition" (I,103,(a)).  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If people's premiums can't go up and they can't be rejected  
based on bad behavior, there is less to be gained by preventive  
care. That's how the plan eliminates some of the incentives for  
people to take care of themselves and not overuse medical  
services.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The companies doing the insuring are even restricted in  
their ability to quit providing insurance. They have to give 180  
days notice if a plan is going to be discontinued (I,110(b)2).  
Then they have to wait five years before offering the plan again.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Remember the price controls implicit in the Clinton bill?  
You'll find them here too. The Secretary of Health and Human  
Services will devise "Federal standards that limit the variation  
in health insurance premiums" so that they will be "reasonably  
priced" (I,112,(a)).  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Remember the bureaucracies in the Clinton health bill? This  
plan instructs the states, as overseen by the feds, to create  
"Health Plan Purchasing Coalitions" to determine the size and  
demographics of each risk pool (I, 131). The burden of proof is  
on the Coalition to show that it is not "discriminating."  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, this bill differs from the Clinton plan in only two  
ways: it is less ambitious and less honest. The Clinton plan  
included specific provisions that tried to account for every  
possible contingency. The Senate bill asserts broad  
principles--cheap health care for all!--but doesn't bother to  
specify how it's going to come about.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both plans are crazy, but is it wackier to wreck a sector  
with specific socialist instructions or broad socialist  
principles? Is it worse to specify the outcome or rig the game to  
ensure a certain outcome? Both are intolerable, although--as it  
turned out--only one could be enacted.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The bill's unanimous support is a measure not of merit, but  
of hypocrisy. For a year, the Republican Party dragged Hillary  
Clinton's name through the mud. Fine. She deserved it. But she  
also deserves an apology from everyone who denounced her bill and  
backed this one.

<title>Rockwell: Oil in the Crossfire -- 4/30/96</title>

<h2>
Oil in the Crossfire
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>


Now that National Hate AT&T Month is over, it's time to  
despise the oil companies. Call them any name you want: gougers,  
extortionists, or greed merchants. Make them the national enemy.  
It's a human rights violation to raise a price.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The occasion of the newest anti-capitalist hysteria is a  
one-year, 10% increase in gasoline prices at the pump. Never mind  
the underlying economic causes. Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary  
is investigating the oil industry to discover who's getting rich  
at the driver's expense.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Not to be left out, Connecticut's two Democratic  
Senators--Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman--are demanding that  
Attorney General Janet Reno knock the heads of oil companies with  
a stump. Heaven knows she can do it, even without resorting to  
tanks and CS gas. Anti-trust law can be bent to make any price  
pattern appear illegal.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For his part, President Clinton has decided to deal with the  
national emergency by dumping 12 million barrels onto the market  
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

All this reveals profound ignorance. Prices respond  
immediately to information about future demand and supply. If a  
credible announcement of a government oil sale didn't reduce the  
price, selling the oil won't do it either.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Recall that this administration complains about foreigners  
dumping their goods on American markets at below cost. However, 
when it's our own government doing the dumping, it's not a  
vicious practice, but a responsible economic policy.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The market specializes in allocating supplies over time via  
the price system. When supply is low and demand is high, prices  
rise to induce new drilling and distribution. In light of higher 
gasoline prices, consumers are already changing some summer  
travel plans, another market response.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The market's price system works so well it doesn't need  
management at all. We don't have a strategic shoe or chicken  
reserve, yet, somehow, we walk and eat. But it's not free-market  
logic that's driving Mr. Clinton's blue light special. He's  
looking to profit politically--we might even call it vote  
gouging--at the expense of private industry.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A far better response--if highly atypical given their sorry  
record this year--comes from Republicans who are demanding a  
repeal of Mr. Clinton's 4.3 cent gas tax increase.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Democrats say the savings from a tax cut won't be "passed  
on" to the consumer. These are the same people who said a tax  
increase would be "passed on" two years ago. Not only that, they  
hoped it would be. In those days, you see, liberals agitated for  
higher gasoline prices as a way of inducing consumers to less, drive 
less, and "pollute" less.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Liberals love oil price increases, especially when they're  
caused by taxes. It's the best of both worlds: people have less  
fun and government gets to siphon off new revenue.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The last time the nation went bonkers over gas prices was  
during the Gulf War. The U.S. government jeopardized imports from  
the entire Arab world, and President Bush (A.B. economics, Yale  
University) was amazed and alarmed to see prices go up. Like Mr.  
Clinton now, he attempted to jawbone companies into cutting  
prices. Corporate executives feared for their bottom lines.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There is always--as hard as government officials find this  
to accept--a purpose behind market-driven changes in price. If a  
good is more scarce, its price will rise so that people can know  
to use less of it. If it is more plentiful, its price will fall 
so consumers can know to live it up. Tampering with the system  
imposes unpredictable distortions.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a country built by free enterprise, there is still mass  
ignorance on what accounts for a price increase in an industry.  
It's not greed, gouging, or illicit gas guzzling. It's either an  
increase in demand, a decrease in supply, or a response to money  
creation by the Fed. No use looking anywhere else.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Just how badly do we want prices to fall? The best and  
surest way is to have free trade in oil. And, yes, that includes  
with Iraq, a country whose people have suffered immeasurably from  
the U.S.'s cruel and unusual sanctions.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To end the war on the market before it escalates further, we  
need an end to embargoes, taxes, regulations, and inflation, all  
of which impede the right of Americans to determine their own  
strategic petroleum reserves.

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservative pundits are having the time of their lives 
blasting Bob Dole, with several calling on him to drop out before 
the convention. The stated reason: his lifetime of politicking 
and state-building has put him hopelessly out of touch with the 
public's desire for real change in Washington. If he becomes the 
nominee, they say, Republicans will lose. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps so. At the same time, it's not fair to single out 
Mr. Dole for such scrutiny, while the leaders of the current 
Congress get off scot-free. After all, Newt Gingrich, Richard 
Armey, and Trent Lott are as much creatures of Washington as Mr. 
Dole. Their reluctance to upset the system that created them and 
sustains their power is what dashed the early hopes that this 
Congress would do something extraordinary. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sensing that the public has not been impressed, the 
Republican leadership is at last getting defensive about its 
record. Mr. Armey, the House Majority Leader, was particularly 
incensed when a news story from the <i>New York Times</i> suggested, 
without further elaboration, that this Congress "has not 
accomplished much else despite its grand early promises" other
than welfare reform.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While hardly anyone would dispute this (even if the welfare 
reform looks piddling), Mr. Armey has taken grave offense. In 
thinking this way, he says, we are ignoring "the truth about the 
accomplishments of this Congress." He proceeds with a strange 
list of items that merely remind us of the extent that this 
Congress has indeed squandered the opportunity of a century. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Armey says "we achieved more than $53 billion in 
discretionary savings." But this is only an "accomplishment" if 
you keep track of the new additions to Congress's Dictionary of 
Budgetary Wordplay. The term "savings" here does not mean cuts, 
which Congress promised, or even cuts in the normal rate of 
increase. It refers to the difference between two artificial 
forecasts that Congress itself controls. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You can try this technique at home. List all the purchases 
you have made this month, no matter how frivolous or how much you 
had to borrow to make them. Measure that against how much you 
would spend if you had  really  splurged. The difference between 
the two is how much you "saved" last month. This budgetary device 
can make your savings rate skyrocket--at least in your own mind. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The term "savings" is smoke and mirrors, while the official 
record will show that this Congress increased total government 
spending at the usual rate. The Congressional leadership has 
accepted and reinforced the Washington rule that spending must 
always increase at the rate of inflation, plus the rate of 
growth, for a total of 5 to 6 percent per year.
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sensing that some people may be on to this game, Mr. Armey 
turns to a page in the Art of Political Dissembling. He says 
Congress has balanced, by the year 2002, that "part of the budget 
that Congress controls." Let's say a three-pack-a-day smoker 
tries the same trick. If he announces "I have quit smoking by 
2002, at least the part I control," do you believe him?
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Ronald Reagan was president, Republicans heaped scorn 
on the Democratic Congress when it claimed that it only 
controlled a portion of the budget. Now the Republican Congress 
uses the same implausible defense of its profligacy. If the 
Congress doesn't control the purse strings, who does?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While claiming not to control the budget, the Congressional 
leadership is also trying to evade other responsibilities. It 
passed an unconstitutional "line-item veto" which not only 
tramples on the separation of powers, but also vastly enhances
the political power of the next president, who will likely be 
Congress's supposed opponent. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In other ways, Congress has stepped up government power, 
even over matters that should remain within its own internal 
purview. For example, in the words of Mr. Armey, the Congress 
made itself "subject to the same workplace standards and 
practices as the private sector." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sound good? In fact, there was a reason why Congress has 
never been subject to such laws. They are enforced by executive 
branch agencies like the Department of Labor, the Justice 
Department, and the EEOC. Private business knows how menacing 
these agencies can be, even to the point of determining workplace
composition with class-action lawsuits. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Already, individual Congressional offices are feeling the 
pressure to hire a "diverse" office, complete with quotas and 
affirmative action. This not only wrecks staff morale and 
cripples efforts to repeal these laws. It subjects Congressional 
offices to a subtle and corrupt domination by the president 
himself. Already, some offices have been pressured to end morning 
prayers for fear of violating the first amendment. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since the New Deal, we have lived under an imperial 
executive that contradicts both the letter and spirit of the 
original Constitution (which instituted Congressional supremacy).
With these two acts--the line-item veto and regulation of 
legislative offices--executive-branch control is enhanced to 
dangerous new levels. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Armey claims that the agricultural bill represents 
revolutionary change, but here again is more bluster than 
substance. The farm bill merely changed the regulations to ensure 
agribusiness subsidies continue to flow in times when price 
supports has ceased to be profitable. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, there are the actions that Mr. Armey has pretended to 
forget about: tacitly approving the bailout of Mexico, a budget and 
power expansion for the BATF, and the authorization of privatized tax 
collection (tax farming, it was once called). Each case represents an 
increase in the degree and scope of federal government power, exactly 
the opposite of what this Congress promised. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now it appears that the leadership is accepting the newest 
conventional wisdom of media-land: Congress needs to pass some 
more legislation before the election to impress voters. Thus the 
leadership is conspiring to give us Hillary-lite in the form of 
new health insurance mandates and regulations, as well as an 
egregious increase in the minimum wage, guaranteed to raise the 
unemployment rate after this session closes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Bob Dole deserves the aspersions being cast upon him, so 
does the entire Congressional leadership. If voters give them a 
whop on the nose this November, it won't be undeserved. It's time 
for men like Mr. Armey to 'fess up, so their coming political 
losses won't be interpreted as a verdict on the public's view 
that most of what the federal government does has outlived its 
usefulness.

An Insight Look
 By Thomas A. Schatz


The Oklahoma City tragedy was felt by every American.  Sympathy for 
the victims, particularly the innocent children, has hit hard.  The 
outpouring of emotion has been and will continue to be overwhelming, 
because Americans care and will do anything and give everything they 
can to help the victims and their families.

All indications are that some members of right-wing militias were 
involved.  Yet, even before all the victims were accounted for and 
properly mourned, some Americans began the "guilt-by-association" 
game.  First, all members of right-wing militia groups were at fault.  
Then, conservative groups of any kind were at fault.  The president 
implicated the radio talk show hosts and called for an end to "reckless 
speech" and  "loud and angry voices," asking Americans to speak out 
against "purveyors of hatred and division."  Then, heated anti-
government rhetoric was to blame for driving the fragile and twisted 
psyches of Timothy McVeigh and his cohorts over the edge.  Carl Rowan 
blamed Senate Majority Leader Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich.  
Radio talk shows and conservative politicians lashed back, accusing 
liberals of using the tragedy for their own political ends.  And the Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation are said to share complicity because of the shootout with 
Randy Weaver and the Waco tragedy.  If anything, this display of 
shameful rhetoric and finger-pointing illustrates America's inability to 
deal with the issue of accountability.

In the wake of such sadness and grief, it is unseemly, grotesque even, for 
politicians and other public figures to make themselves the central figures 
in this tragedy.  And we should know from experience that blaming 
people simply because they hold similar views to those espoused by the 
alleged perpetrators is problematic.

Those who marched or otherwise protested against the war in Vietnam in 
an exercise of their First Amendment rights (including Bill Clinton) 
watched in horror when four students were killed at Kent State.  They 
shivered after learning of the Weather Underground campus bombings.  
After decades of oppression and discrimination, the Black Panthers 
became more militant and armed themselves.  Individuals from many of 
these movements committed crimes.  But in both of these cases, and 
many others throughout history, Americans didn't allow the misguided 
actions of a few extremists to annul or strip away the legitimate aims of 
the many.  

If one wants to make a connection between taxpayers, members of 
conservative organizations, radio talk show hosts, and the nuts that blew 
up the federal building in Oklahoma City, one must also make that same 
connection between taxpayers, members of liberal organizations, militant 
environmentalists, and the unabomber who struck again in California last 
week; or taxpayers, members of Christian fundamentalist churches, 
militant anti-abortionists, and the individual who shot the doctor in 
Pensacola, Florida.  The only real link in all of these examples is among 
the extremes on all sides and their willingness, for whatever twisted 
reasons, to resort to violence and murder.

The Oklahoma City bombing should neither be used as an excuse to 
attack the motivation of groups that seek less intrusive and more efficient 
government, nor as an excuse to perpetuate government programs which 
have simply become useless.  The budget debate, to take place 
imminently in the House and Senate, must go on.  In fact, if anything, 
that debate should be even more focused now on the proper role of 
government and the priorities that must be established for the future.

It's time to mourn, but it's also time to make decisions that will affect the 
standard of living for our children and grandchildren. 

Blunt talk, even when it seems harsh, has always been an element of 
American political discourse.  Tough action on the deficit must be taken 
on Capitol Hill.  Deliberating the merits of where and how to balance the 
budget will naturally evoke emotions on both sides of the aisle, especially 
now.  Eliminating obsolete programs, closing down entire departments, 
and reducing the massive increases in federal spending scheduled to take 
effect over the next several years is essential to the health and welfare of 
the American people and should not be inferred as a blanket abhorrence 
of all government, and certainly not the people that work within the 
system.

CAGW's Prime Cuts contains 651 recommendations to save $1.45 trillion 
over the next five years, including many that go back to the Grace 
Commission.  More than half come right from Congress' own 
Congressional Budget Office, and have been ignored.  President Clinton 
is right to call for increased law enforcement personnel and concentrated 
efforts to prevent domestic and international terrorism; that's an 
expenditure that CAGW can certainly support.  In fact, it's the sort of 
priority and choice that must be made on a much broader scale -- for 
every federal department, agency, and individual program.  That's what 
taxpayers are asking, and that's the task that must be carried out.

Keeping Congress on the Cutting Edge  
 By Thomas A. Schatz  
  
 
As the budget debate heats up on Capitol Hill, it is clear that  
sustaining the momentum of the first 100 days will be tough sledding  
for Republican leaders.  The rhetoric from the opponents of change has  
been and will continue to be harsh, unfounded, and misleading.  Inside  
the halls of Congress, the hand-wringing and whining at the undoing of  
years of wasteful and ineffective programs would make one believe the  
country will go down the drain in the near future.  
 
But taxpayers still want the revolution which began on November 8th of  
1994 with the election of a Republican Congress to be sustained.   
Outside the Washington beltway, support for reform remains strong.  
 
The truth is, without the changes being wrought in the new Congress,  
we will hit rock bottom and devastate the standard of living for  
future generations.  
 
The interest on the national debt is now almost twice as large as the  
budget deficit.  The president's budget projects a deficit of $192  
billion in fiscal year 1995 and an interest payment of $334 billion.   
In other words, without the interest on the national debt, there would  
be a surplus of $142 billion!  Over the next ten years, we could run a  
surplus every year if we did not have to pay the interest -- which  
will range from $330 billion to more than $500 billion -- and reduce  
the debt by $1,355 billion.  That, of course, is assuming that  
interest rates remain as projected.  If they go higher (remember a  
prime rate of nearly 21 percent in late 1980?), the results could be a  
Mexico-type disaster, where other countries will have to bail out the  
United States.  
 
But the forces of the status quo are doing everything in their power  
to fight the knights in shining armor -- both Republicans and  
Democrats -- who are rescuing the future of our nation.  
 
Here's how the truth is being twisted:  
 
During the debate on the balanced budget amendment (BBA), the  
naysayers claimed that Social Security must be exempt.  The real  
threat to Social Security, as expressed by Sen. John Breaux, a  
Democrat from Louisiana, is if it is not exempt.  Keeping the program  
out of the BBA would give Congress the opportunity to add any program  
it wanted to "Social Security," which would undermine the basic old  
age, survivors and disability payments now provided to beneficiaries.   
For example, Congress could set up a special fund for student aid  
under Social Security, or for farmers, or veterans.  Already, Social  
Security disability funds are being used for cash payments to drug  
addicts and alcoholics, a well-publicized abuse of our tax dollars.   
Do we really want to leave that program untouchable under a balanced  
budget amendment?  And if a program is included in the exemption under  
Social Security, it is likely to expand dramatically as has been the  
practice in Washington.  The red herring of Social Security in the  
debate over the BBA was the first major volley in the battle to turn  
around the effort to eliminate the waste and the deficit.  
 
Social Security doesn't have to be involved at all in the budget  
debate: Representatives Jerry Solomon (R-N.Y.) and Mark Neumann (R- 
Wisc.) have proposed a budget that would truly remove Social Security  
from the furor of how to rein in federal spending.  Their plan would  
not only balance the budget in five years by freezing all spending at  
current levels, it would eliminate the debt in thirty years by  
increasing spending by one percent less than revenues through the year  
2025 in their budget proposal.  Their list of options includes $70  
billion more than is necessary to balance the budget within five  
years.  
 
According to opponents, the provisions of the House welfare bill will  
result in millions of children being left in the streets, and massive  
homelessness and starvation.  But these alarmists failed to note that  
spending more than $5 trillion since 1965 in the war against poverty  
has not solved the problem.  The House bill moves in a new direction,  
which is apparently too much for the defenders of the status quo to  
handle.  
 
Spending on welfare will increase by only $60 billion less than  
projected in President Clinton's FY 1996 budget.  The school lunch  
program will increase by four percent per year instead of six percent  
per year over the next five years.  This is fiscal restraint, not  
heartlessness.  Claiming that children will be starving on the streets  
is just a little too melodramatic to hold water.  
 
The truth will win out, and the waste will be cut.  But the job is far  
from over.  We must preserve the future for our children and  
grandchildren.

DENVER INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT:  WHAT WENT WRONG 
 By: Thomas Schatz, President, Citizens Against Government Waste 
 

This past March, the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste 
(CCAGW) held a regional taxpayers' conference in Denver.  It's ironic 
that the leading group fighting waste had to fly into a prime example 
of why America is currently strangled by a $4.8 trillion national debt 
-- the new Denver International Airport (DIA).  Assessing what went 
wrong with the Denver Airport is critically important.    

According to the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation 
and the General Accounting Office (GAO), $685 million will be spent by 
the federal government on the Denver Airport through fiscal year (FY) 
2001.  Every single dollar of this $685 million will be wasted.   This 
is not an overstatement because this airport was not needed.  Plain 
and simple.  Stapleton Airport could have been upgraded to accommodate 
any larger planes that might land in Denver in the future.  Extending 
runways at Stapleton would have been inexpensive and quick.  But 
because this country has an edifice complex, a new structure had to be 
built.  When a family has a tight budget, they don't go to the opera 
or drive an expensive car.  The federal government has to realize that 
we cannot afford luxuries, especially when there isn't a need for such 
a luxury. 
 
Just as the federal government has become adept at deficits, so will 
DIA.  The GAO projected a cumulative operating deficit of  $230 
million by its February opening.  
 
The DIA is government waste -- at its worst.  DIA is not an example of 
pork-barrel waste.  The kind of government waste that occurred in 
Denver is more insidious.  The back-room politicking and the 
misinformation that occurred is an embarrassment to the federal 
government as well as the local government.   

The new 53-square-mile airport is larger than the District of 
Columbia.  The airport is 25 miles from downtown.  A cab ride will 
increase from $7 to Stapleton to $50 to DIA.  There is currently no 
supporting infrastructure to serve the new airport.  Access to rental 
cars and hotels is extremely difficult.  These are the general 
problems.  Here are the specific problems with DIA.   

The public was shut out of the process, and no user or public needs 
were defined or documented.  The politicians limited the vote to the 
core city, or about 10 percent of airport users.  Denver is a 
relatively small city of 460,000, down six percent in population in 
the 1980's.  Denver is not among the top 400 cities worldwide, yet the 
city set out to build the "World's Largest Airport."  Only about 70 
gates out of 200 are actually in operation at DIA.  A dozen or so 
gates are not in operation because of a lack of covered jetways.  Thus 
incoming flights are delayed.  
 
The Denver Airport has come to symbolize the reckless manner in which 
federal construction is carried out in America.  Because the airport 
is eligible for formula grants, money is not awarded based on merit.  
If this were a project that was being funded by a private financial 
institution, more scrutiny would have gone into the planning, 
implementation and construction of this airport.  The federal 
government should not be providing an open checkbook for construction 
based on the fact that it creates jobs.   The $685 million that the 
federal government will spend through 2001 could mean $1,489 in tax 
relief for every resident of Denver. 

There was no need for a new airport in Denver.  During the 1986-1989 
planning period, Denver's share of the U.S. air travel market dropped 
53 percent -- from 3.8 percent in 1986 to 2.57 percent in 1990 (1994 
is estimated at 2.6 percent).  However, during those years, the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Denver forecast that DIA 
would be the fastest-growing airport in the U.S., with 50 million 
passengers by 1995, and the second-busiest by 2000.  According to the 
Air Transportation Association (ATA), Denver also dropped from 8th to 
19th in U.S air cargo tonnage during the past five years.  The ATA has 
never included Denver in the "Table of Top 30 U.S. Domestic Air Travel 
Markets."  Top listings are high population cities and vacation 
centers.  Denver is neither. 
 
According to Mayor Peña in Volume I of the 1987 Airport Report, 
"Stapleton had the best history of low delays.  Stapleton was ranked 
number five in traffic and number nine in delays."  The Peña 
administration in 1988 decided to trash Stapleton, then one of the 
best airports in the world, to build a totally new airport for $1.5 
billion.  Mr. Peña's 1989 Airport Report claimed "Stapleton was grid 
locking the nation," and by 1996 "is expected to lead the delay list 
with 158,000 hours annually."   Federal funding for DIA was to be $500 
million, and the "Stapleton site would be disposed of over several 
years to raise more than a half-billion dollars."   The projected cost 
is now more than $4.9 billion.   

The bottom line is:  DIA is expensive and unnecessary.  The new Denver 
Airport should not have been built.  The way that it was built is an 
embarrassment to representative government at all levels.   
 
What will the real losses be at DIA?  How soon will the losses eat up 
the reserves set aside to pay the bondholders?  Who will pay for the 
bailout -- the city and county of Denver, Colorado's taxpayers, or the 
federal government?  Who will be left holding the bag when this 
airport fails?  The American taxpayer will be left in the lurch again.

The Long Hot Summer Ahead   
 Thomas A. Schatz 
 Citizens Against Government Waste
 May 18, 1995 
 

 Outsiders usually aren't surprised -- and often think it appropriate  
-- when they learn that much of Washington was built on a swamp.  
While that fact only partially accounts for the hot gases that tend to 
swirl here, this summer promises to be stickier than most, with 
rhetorical fireworks flying that could dwarf the pyrotechnics on the 
4th of July.    

 Freon will be in short supply as the battle of the budget burns 
through the summer and into September.  The deficit hawks, promising a 
balanced budget by 2002, will square off against the special interests 
and sentinels of the status quo, who, as one Republican leader has 
said, have nothing to offer but fear itself.  At stake are the hearts 
and minds of everyday Americans and the political high ground as we 
move into an election year.   

 While every battle seems decisive from the perspective of the 
interlocked combatants, this time it's no exaggeration.  The outcome 
will determine whether future Americans are born debt-free, whether 
the growth of government can be reversed, whether the will of average 
taxpayers can prevail over the more focused energies of special 
interests, and whether Americans are still capable of sacrificing in 
the short term to safeguard the future.   

 The balanced budget proposals recently put forward -- reductions in 
spending of $1.4 trillion in the House and $961 billion in the Senate 
over seven years -- provide a game plan only, establishing broad 
budgetary parameters.  The specific cuts and final shape of the 
package will be hashed out during the summer.  Which components live 
or die will be determined in part by the war of words, by the ebb and 
flow of public opinion.     

 Even if every cut or reduction in growth being proposed survives, 
government spending will still grow from $1.53 trillion this year to 
$1.8 trillion in 2002.  Social Security spending, the "third rail" of 
American politics, is off the table.  Medicare (which will be bankrupt 
by 2002 without reform) will grow as well, but at a more manageable 
rate than 10 percent a year, its current pace.  At least one and 
perhaps as many as three federal departments could be eliminated 
altogether.  Hundreds of anachronistic agencies and programs will fall 
by the wayside.  These, in short, are some of the most dramatic 
changes in the size and scope of government since the heady days of 
the Great Society.  Only this time, contraction is the goal, rather 
than expansion.   

 What avenues will be taken to arrive at a smaller, more affordable 
government?  The first is privatization -- as first proposed by the 
Grace Commission more than a decade ago.  As the late J. Peter Grace 
recognized, there are many public entities that could stand alone as 
private, profit-making ventures.  Capitol Hill budget cutters are 
looking to privatize the Federal Aviation Administration, the Naval 
and Strategic Petroleum Reserves, and the National Helium Reserves.  
Also likely to be sold off are the nation's five Power Marketing 
Administrations, which sell power generated by federally-built 
hydroelectric facilities.  To this list, Citizens Against Government 
Waste would add the Tennessee Valley Authority, the National Weather 
Service, the space shuttle program, and the military commissary 
system.   

 Next is consolidation --  putting the government's self-duplicating 
and redundant functions under a single roof and reversing the 
politically-driven proliferation of cabinet-level agencies.  Should we 
do away with the Department of Energy, created in response to the 
energy crisis of the 1970's, its responsibility for nuclear weapons 
labs and facilities could easily be subsumed by the Department of 
Defense.  The Federal Highway Administration and the National Highway 
Safety Administration should be merged.  The military's four, separate 
health-care bureaucracies should be placed under single management.  
And there's much more consolidation that could be done.   

 When all else fails, there's always termination.  It's been said that 
there's nothing in the world more permanent than a temporary federal 
program.  The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) is a prime 
example.  Thirty years after being launched as a component of Lyndon 
Johnson's Great Society, the ARC serves today as little more than a 
pork-barrel for opportunistic politicians.  Three-quarters of a 
million dollars in ARC "anti-poverty" funds will be spent this year 
helping to build a practice facility for the NFL Carolina Panthers at 
a private college in Spartanburg, South Carolina, one of the most 
affluent counties in that state.  The Economic Development 
Administration, another anachronistic agency that should be 
terminated, has chipped in $500,000 more for the stadium.  The 
Interstate Commerce Commission, the bureaucracy that wouldn't die and 
occupies itself today publishing pamphlets about how to start a small 
railroad, also begs for a wooden stake through the heart.  There are 
many others that need to be added to the Endangered Bureaucracies 
List.   

 Another concept gaining popularity in Washington is "devolution," 
which is short-hand for returning power, money, and responsibility for 
administering certain programs back to the states.  The states, each 
working as individual laboratories, or incubators for innovation, will 
manage these programs more efficiently.  If all goes according to 
plan, Medicaid will be delivered to the states as a block grant, 
letting them dispense it as they see fit, as will food stamps.  Other 
welfare reform measures will also be downloaded to the state level.   

 Finally, even if the size of the federal government is reduced, much 
more can be done to make it run more like a business.  While not very 
"sexy," financial management reform is essential if we want the most 
efficient government for the money.  Unless there is full 
implementation of the Chief Financial Officers Act, and the 
bureaucracy is compelled to deliver timely, trustworthy financial 
reports, the ship of state sails in a fog and our leaders have no way 
to know which reforms are working and which aren't.   

 The road to a balanced budget won't be without its potholes: the 
whole effort may succumb to politics as usual and break down before it 
even gets going.  To succeed, many sacred cows will have to be put out 
to pasture.  Many old ways of thinking about government will have to 
be discarded.  We'll have to forge ahead even when the Chicken Littles 
and special interests say that the sky is falling.  After decades of 
saying "Yes," Washington's political class will have to bring itself 
to say "No."  In turn, voters will have to reward those who have the 
courage to say "No," holding up fiscal prudence rather than 
piggishness as a virtue, and learn to stop turning to the federal 
government for the solution to every imaginable problem.  An America 
increasingly fractured into adversarial special interests, each 
fighting for a piece of the pie, will have to find a way to coalesce 
around a new set of affordable national priorities.   

 In short, the era of governmental limits and fiscal responsibility 
won't be born without a long, painful, and noisy labor.

<h3>HUD:  BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD</h3>

By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz </a><p>
<hr></center>
It is heartening to hear Congress is considering the elimination of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  It is heartening to see that someone in Washington has figured out that 
Washington does not have all the answers and it is time to try something else.<p> 
HUD was created in 1965 out of several federal agencies concerned with housing, mortgage finance and urban issues.  HUD was formed to address an emerging urban crisis and a growing underclass, subject to squalid housing conditions, crime, unemployment, eroding families and limited educational achievement.<p>   
As originally conceived, HUD was an integral part of the "War on Poverty," which to date has cost $5 trillion.  Our urban problems have not markedly improved during the 30-year war, and many would argue that conditions have grown worse.  Life in the roughest parts of our cities is similar to Hobbes' state of nature:  nasty, brutish and short!  <p> 
Since the $8 billion HUD scandal in 1989, the words "financial mismanagement" and HUD have become synonymous.  In 1984, the Grace Commission warned of financial disasters stemming from HUD's fundamental flaw.  According to the Grace Commission, HUD is "a financial institution with a social mission," and the emphasis on its social goals "resulted in a higher priority on program execution at the expense of the internal management requirements normally associated with a financial institution."  Sound financial management is secondary to spending. <p>   
Since 1990, HUD has been featured prominently in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) "high risk" program, which lists by department the federal government's fundamental financial management weaknesses.  HUD's financial management systems for monitoring low-income housing assistance are so bad that HUD cannot assure taxpayers that their taxes are used for eligible recipients, or that there is adequate fund control for more than $100 billion in long-term contractual funding serving 3 million families.  The Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) insurance fund for single family housing loans may not be sufficient to cover losses.  Currently, FHA has in force $303 billion of insurance, but it may not be able to pay potential claims without seeking higher appropriations from Congress.  Also cited are 106 Public Housing Authorities (PHA), accounting for 17 percent of all PHA housing units, which have been identified as troubled.  Taxpayers cannot be "assured that public housing funds achieve intended purposes."  PHAs administer more than half of HUD's budget.   <p>
Not only is HUD wasteful and ineffective, it is a financial liability.  Any private corporation in the position of the federal government would have done something about the department long ago.<p> 
HUD's failure to resolve its 30-year internal conflict between its role as a financial institution and its social goals has prompted freshmen House Republicans, led by Representatives Sam Brownback (R-
Kan.) and Sue Myrick (R-N.C.), and a Senate task force, chaired by Senators Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.) and Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.), to recommend HUD's elimination. <p>  
The recently released House bill, known as "The Federal Housing Reform and Local Empowerment Act," proposes to replace the existing public housing and housing assistance with a voucher program to be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Under the proposal, state governments are given the options of participating in the HHS program, running their own voucher program, or setting up their own public housing program.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this would save $17 billion in budget authority over five years. <p>
The bill also consolidates many of HUD's programs into two block grant programs:  the Housing and Development Block Grant and the Special Populations Block Grant, both of which will be administered by HHS.  Other programs will either be eliminated, transferred to other government agencies, or privatized. <p>
Earlier this year, the Administration recognized that something had to be done to save HUD from the scalpels of Republican budget hawks.  As part of the vice president's reinvention program, HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros laid out the administration's strategy for saving the department.  Cisneros proposed consolidating 60 HUD programs into three community and housing funds, creating a voucher system for public housing, and converting FHA into a government-owned corporation 
to reduce costs.  According to OMB, the administration's proposal would save $770 million over five years.  That's less than five percent of the savings from the congressional reform bill. <p>
The "reinvention strategy," which has become a trademark of the Clinton administration, is an attempt to protect favorite programs and departments from budget cuts and taxpayer criticism, under the guise 
of improving the federal bureaucracy.  For the Clinton administration, reinvention substitutes for true reform.  More often than not, the rhetoric of reinvention has become an argument for the status quo and 
an assurance to special interests that business-as-usual can continue.<p>     
This rearguard action was recently rejected by former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who said that the "American people do not want to reinvent government, they want to reduce it."  He added that taxpayers, "[D]on't want to manage the bureaucracy better, they want to shrink the bureaucracy.  And they don't want people dependent upon government, they want people empowered." <p>
HUD has had its 30-year trial run.   It failed.   It's time to downsize, devolve, privatize and terminate HUD.

<title>The Peanut Shell Game</title>

<h2>The Peanut Shell Game</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<b> By:  Thomas A. Schatz: President, Citizens Against Government Waste</b>
<p>   
Since the days of the Great Depression, American farming communities have lived under the umbrella of government subsidies.  These assistance measures, initiated because of unstable market conditions, create strong dependency as farmers cling to the benefits of government intervention.     
<p>  
As a result of these programs, the American farmer is enriched and capitalizes on his position, while substantially distorting the agricultural market.  Through quotas and government handouts, farmers receive above-market prices, crop failure relief, and engage in a feudalistic method of production.  For the taxpayer and consumer,   
agricultural subsidy programs increase prices and waste tax dollars through needless expenditures.   
<p>
Established in 1933 as part of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the peanut subsidy program stabilized agricultural income through price supports and production control.  Subsidies were welcome because one-fourth of the U.S. population resided in rural areas and farm earnings were well below national average income statistics, constituting a mere 53 percent of a nonfarm family's salary.  In 1933, the Chairman   
of the House Agriculture Committee, Representative Marvin Jones (D-Texas), believed in the necessity of the bill, but noted that the President "would surrender such programs when the emergency (was) past."  In 1934, FDR's Secretary of Agriculture, Henry Wallace, said, "The present program for readjusting productive acreage to market requirements is admittedly but a temporary method of dealing with an emergency.  It could not be relied upon as a permanent means of keeping farm production in line with market requirements."   
<p>
The emergency is over and the dynamics of farming have changed.  The number of farms have decreased by 69 percent, from 6.8 million farms in 1935  to 2 million farms today.  More importantly, the average income of a farm family now exceeds $39,000, higher than a nonfarm family's average income.  With the number of farms decreasing and the stabilization of agricultural income, programs such as peanut   
subsidies are relics of a bygone era.    
<p>
Peanuts are an important political and financial cash crop in the South.  The "Peanut Belt" stretches from Tidewater, Virginia to the New Mexican plateau and produces 5 billion pounds of peanuts, with an estimated value of $1.4 billion.  The political consequences outweigh the financial when it comes to eradicating the peanut program.   
<p>
Administered through the USDA's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, the peanut program consists of two mandates. First, the program controls the domestic supply of peanuts through a  poundage quota system.  This Soviet-style regulatory approach sets limits on production and allocates who should produce the specified amount.  Second, by restraining the domestic supply through the quota   
system, the government sets a minimum selling price for all domestic sales.  With a domestic support price of $714 per ton compared to a  world price of $494 per ton, domestic prices are 44.5 percent higher than the average world market price.  Domestic buyers must pay this higher price.  Subsidies are in direct contrast to the American ideal of free trade, which embraces the lowest cost and most efficient   
producer.   
<p>
The federal government is merely evoking a feudalistic system that benefits a few large farms while suppressing the rest.  Although anyone can grow peanuts, only those who have quota land can grow peanuts for domestic, price-supported use.  Thus, non-quota owners must either rent land that is part of the quota system, or settle for   exportation at the world market price.  Seventy percent of quota  
holders rent their land to peanut farmers, making $208 million a year in rental fees without growing one single peanut.  Contrary to popular political folklore, small farmers are not benefiting from the peanut program.  Currently, 80 percent of the quotas to grow domestic peanuts are owned by 20 percent of peanut farmers.   
<p>
To arrive at the appropriate price support amount, the government uses  the national average production cost.  Based on increases in the prices paid by producers for commodities and services, interest, taxes, and wage rates, the government then deciphers an increased fair price without considering the costs of producing peanuts.  In an  absurd twist of fate, if peanut production costs drop, the fixedsupport price still might rise, based on the entire U.S. average of  production costs.  Historically, the gap between quota support prices and costs has increased every year.   
<p>
Government control does not stop at the quotas and price supports. The USDA uses these two prescriptions for further market interruptions.  First, under law, peanut farmers may sell their peanuts directly to the government instead of market buyers.    
Regardless of crop conditions, peanut farmers have a guaranteed buyer-- the federal government -- at or above the inflated domestic price.  If the government cannot sell all of the collected peanuts to the public sector, then the rest will be sold for oil or meal at substantially lower prices.  In the end, the government picks up the price difference between the high price support and the market price.   
<p> 
Money spent by both the consumer and the government is not worth these results.  Every American farmer deserves a free market in which to develop efficiency and gain market share through his own right, not a government-given quota.  According to the General Accounting Office, consumers spend an additional $513 million a year for peanut products such as Peanut Butter and Kung Pao Chicken, excessive profits   
transferred to the peanut producers.  In the long run, these high   prices will hurt the peanut industry as consumers look to other lower-priced products.  In 1990, there was a 10 percent drop in the food industry's demand for peanuts.    
<p>
The $119 million spent by the federal government on the peanut program annually doesn't even take into account the administrative fees. The  price tag for the peanut program exceeds $200 million when administrative costs are calculated.     
<p>
This subsidy must end.  Consumers and taxpayers must not foot the bill   for this absurd manipulation of our strong hallowed market economy. This shell game of peanut subsidies must be cracked wide open and stopped.

<b>President, Citizens Against Government Waste By:  Thomas A. Schatz</b>
<p> 
Much of the nation has been under the oppressive grip of a heat wave with temperatures exceeding 100 degrees.  These sweltering days of summer are no match for the oppressive burden of federal regulations that have gripped the nation for years.  Come October, the cool fall air will replace the stagnant heat, but unnecessary and ridiculous federal regulations will continue to cost American taxpayers nearly $600 billion per year. 
<p>
In its unrelenting leadership role, the House of Representatives is actively trying to get rid of burdensome regulations and return the nation to common sense and fiscal freedom.  The Regulatory Reform Bill, which was signed on February 24, 1995, allows property owners to seek compensation when a federal regulatory action has taken place and improves the process by which federal regulations are developed and 
issued.   
<p>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) again took on ridiculous regulations when he proposed "Corrections Days" earlier this year.  Corrections Days, which passed with a vote of 271 to 146 on June 20, 1995, is a mechanism to streamline the termination of silly regulations.  The House will be holding corrections days twice a month.  Among the many targets for corrections is the repeal of a provision that places costly safety requirements on ships carrying vegetable oil into or out of U.S. waters, even though the oil, if spilled, poses no threat to the environment or public health; and a federal rule barring the removal of trees surrounding an airport for safety purposes if those trees are in a wetland. 
<p>
In its first session of corrections on July 25, 1995, the House voted 269 to 156 to exempt San Diego, California from a water pollution regulation that would require the city to build a $2 billion sewage treatment plant.  Critics of the plant contend that discharging sewage into the Pacific Ocean four miles offshore would not affect sea-life 
and in some instances would benefit marine life.  This is an important first step in trying to bring the federal regulation leviathan under control.   
<p>
As the House catapults ahead with serious regulatory reform, the Senate has once again lagged behind.  Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kansas) set aside the GOP-sponsored regulatory reform bill on July 18, 1995, because of lack of support.  Senator Dole is unsure when and if the bill will ever come up for consideration in the 
Senate.  The Senate is too timid to attack the voracious appetite of federal regulations. 
<p>
Regulation reform is not an esoteric or vague concept.  Regulations affect everybody.  Government regulation dramatically increases the cost of doing business, which results in fewer jobs and lower salaries, and makes U.S. companies less competitive. 
<p>
Regulations extend their claws into all sectors of society including food and medicine, the environment, and the Department of the Interior (DOI). 
<p>
Probably the most powerful regulatory agency in the entire federal government is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).   The expansion of the FDA is unparalleled in the federal government.  Growing from 4,470 employees in 1970, with a budget of $227 million, the FDA currently has 9,217 employees at a cost of $764 million.  This is a 106-percent increase in employees and a 237- percent increase in budget.  The FDA approves more regulations rather than drugs.  Drug approval averages 12 years and $359 million per drug.  The cost of this excessive regulation is passed on to the consumer at approximately 25 cents per dollar.  Critically needed drugs are delayed incessantly because of excessive regulations. 
<p>
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is notorious for its overzealousness in regulating.  Initially established in 1970 to combat a real and growing pollution problem, the EPA has turned into a monolithic regulating monster.  Evidence of such heavy-handed regulations include a Pennsylvania couple being threatened with 
polluting a waterway by installing a tennis court on their land; a couple in New York being fined $30,000 for building a deck on their house because, among other things, it cast a shadow on a wetland;  and an auto parts store owner being fined $10,000 because he didn't post a sign, which was down because of window washing, stating that his store accepts waste motor oil for recycling.  Micro- managing the 
environment instead of fighting pollution is the new mission of the EPA. 
<p>
DOI weighs in with its own stupid and environmentally unsound practice of micro management.  The Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the National Biological Survey (NBS) are examples of the DOI's misguided policies.  The ESA causes hardships for private property owners, businesses, and developers; it confers enormous power on unaccountable bureaucrats; and is costly to U.S taxpayers.   
<p>
The ESA has listed 853 species to be protected, while some 4,000 other plants and animals are official candidates for future listings.  According to Maura Dolans of the Los Angeles Times, blunders by the Fish and Wildlife Service may have contributed to an extinction.  The Service spent nearly $3 million  to buy a Florida habitat for the endangered dusky seaside sparrow -- and then neglected to manage the land properly.  The last bird died in 1987. 
<p>
The NBS was created to catalogue everything that walks, crawls, swims or flies around this country on public or private lands.  Critics say that the program will take years to complete, involve thousands of government scientists, and would clash with private property rights.  Because an area was designated under the NBS as a wilderness area, a lost Boy Scout was not rescued in a timely manner.  A rescue 
helicopter was not allowed to land in a sensitive area.  A note had to be dropped to the child.  The Boy Scout was eventually rescued by a second helicopter when the search party failed to find him. 
<p>
Needless regulations are shortsighted and stupid.  Some may seem humorous, but all are serious.  The increased presence of federal regulations erode away personal freedoms as well as our bank accounts.  The federal government should be for the people not against the people.

<h2>Tales From the Gypped</h2>


By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><p>
</center><hr>
<br>
Medicare reform will be among Congress' top priorities after the  
August recess.  Those who are fighting any reform, their message is  
that each dollar spent in the program produces a dollar in benefits  
for America's seniors.  Nothing could be further from the truth. <p> 
The Medicare program is a sitting duck for con artists, thieves, and  
degreed opportunists.   Because of its size, diabolical complexity and  
lax management practices, this $177 billion leviathan has become the  
equivalent of a Gucci-clad matron sauntering down the street sporting  
a flashing neon sign that says "please rob me!"  Those with a notion  
to defraud Medicare know that these three factors alone guarantee that  
the risks of gaming the system are worth taking because Medicare is  
where the easy money is.<p>
In fiscal year 1993, Medicare processed almost 700 million claims.   
That's nearly 2 million per day, about 250 million more than it  
processed five years earlier, and nearly six times the number of tax  
returns processed by the Internal Revenue Service.  Physicians, supply  
companies, or diagnostic laboratories have about three chances out of  
1,000 of having Medicare audit their billing practices in any given  
year.<p>
Medicare fraud is perpetrated by billing companies, providers,  
suppliers, even organized crime and drug dealers.  There are scams  
involving kickbacks, durable medical equipment, prescription  
marketing, nursing homes and home care providers, tampered medical  
supplies, ambulance and taxi services.  Medicare fraud is as varied as  
the imaginations of the criminals who game the system.  Citizens  
Against Government Waste's (CAGW) new report, Medicare Fraud: Tales  
from the Gypped, details more than one hundred examples.<p>  
Unless you've been away on the space shuttle, you surely are aware of  
the litany of waste that plagues the program.  But individual examples  
don't give the full picture.  It is heart-stopping.   At least ten  
percent, or $17 billion each year, in Medicare spending is irrevocably  
squandered.  That 10 percent is also, coincidentally, the annual  
growth rate that is leading the program to bankruptcy over the next  
several years.<p>  
Here are just a few of the countless examples:<p>     
** Several Michigan pharmacists obtained large supplies of expired  
drugs and dispensed them to nursing home patients, at full cost to  
Medicare.  One of the pharmacists who participated in the scheme  
quipped, "those people are old, they'll never know the difference, and  
they'll be dead soon anyway." <p> 
** A pharmaceutical salesman peddled $6 million in expired,  
mislabeled, unsterile, or second-hand pacemakers over an eight-year  
period, sometimes providing Hawaiian vacations or prostitutes as  
kickbacks to cardiologists who agreed to implant the adulterated  
devices in unsuspecting patients.  In his offices, authorities found  
"a number of bloody pacemakers, raising suspicions he was reselling  
devices surgically removed from other patients or even from corpses." <p> 
** In Florida, more than a dozen companies, claiming to supply  
Medicare patients with liquid nutritional supplements and feeding  
kits, defrauded Medicare of an estimated $20 million.  The "kingpin"  
of the scheme fled the country, but was found in Venezuela and  
extradited. <p> 
** A company in New York lured Medicare beneficiaries into disclosing  
their Medicare identification numbers in exchange for microwave ovens,  
air conditioners, or angora underwear.   <p>
** A Georgia health-care company is under investigation for allegedly  
pocketing more than $14 million in illegally obtained Medicare funds.   
Money allegedly went toward golf-course memberships, vacations, a new  
car for the CEO's son, $9.7 million for computer software, $84,341 for  
gourmet popcorn, and $18,600 for lobbying activities.  <p>
** A California supply company billed Medicare for $5 million worth of  
surgical dressings for patients who never underwent surgery. <p> 
There is no doubt that Medicare is in crisis.  We've heard from  
Medicare's Public Trustees that the program is faltering.  This year,  
the trustees have given us a date certain for Medicare's impending  
demise if its current rate of spending is not reduced: 2002.  They've  
told us that if we don't act today, never mind the long-range affect  
on baby boomers and their children, our parents and grandparents, who  
currently receive benefits, will be cut off in just seven years. <p>   
Rhetoric and denial are the postures of choice in Washington.  Some  
members of Congress, along with their outside supporters, claim there  
is no crisis.  Others argue that the federal government will never let  
the system run out of money, as if the American taxpayer is a never- 
ending source of cash for this out-of-control program.  And then there  
are those, like Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), who can't  
resist the easy politics of intergenerational fear-mongering.    <p>
But Republican attention to Medicare's problems are not some partisan  
plot.  Mr. Gephardt ought to familiarize himself with the authors of  
the 1995 Trustees Report, which included such Republican "friends" as  
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Labor Secretary Robert Reich, Health  
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, and Social Security  
Commissioner Shirley Chater.  <p>
If Medicare's centralized, non-competitive, single-payer system is at  
the heart of billions of dollars in wasted resources, eliminating  
waste and fraud requires that competitive, market forces be introduced  
into the Medicare system.  Free market forces and incentives would  
reduce Medicare's excessive costs and improve the quality of health  
care available for seniors.  By putting the onus for rooting out fraud  
and abuse on the private sector, and creating inescapable incentives  
to do so, risk-free opportunities to defraud the system would be  
greatly reduced.  Moreover, we would finally provide seniors with a  
medical system that develops greater quality rather than one that  
simply increasingly consumes more and more health dollars.  <p>
How we deal with Medicare's crisis will speak volumes about who we are  
as Americans and what kind of society we value.  At stake is whether  
today's senior citizens, not to mention those of us who are following  
close behind, will have a viable health-care system in the future.   
Waste and fraud will only rob us all of a better future if we continue  
to assume it is an unavoidable result of a well-meaning big government  
program.<p>

<h2>Stop Federalizing Local Crimes</h2>

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>

<p><hr><P>
                       
The hearings and report of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Terrorism,  
Technology and Government Information prove again the importance and value  
of Congressional investigations. This function of Congress operates as the  
best, and often the only, way to expose the misdeeds of government.  
  <P>
For three years, the news of the killing of an innocent women and child on  
a remote Idaho mountaintop by an FBI sharpshooter, and the subsequent  
coverup by the FBI and Attorney General Janet Reno, had been known only to  
readers of right-wing newsletters and surfers on the Internet. Newspapers  
and TV networks didn't find those actions worth reporting.  
  <P>
Finally, Senator Arlen Specter's subcommittee, with the C-span cameras  
rolling, laid the ugly story out for all to see. The 154-page subcommittee  
report just released assessed blame on everybody involved in the shootout,  
but the part that should concern us most is the outrageous actions of  
federal law- enforcement agencies.  
  <P>
The role of the BATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) began with  
spreading false and defamatory information about Randy Weaver and concluded  
with continuing to defend inexcusable conduct. The FBI's role included  
firing the fatal shots, lying about who was to blame, defending the  
constitutional "shoot-on-sight" actions, and promoting the bureaucrat in  
charge of the mess.  
  <P>
Specter rightfully suggests that the BATF ought to be abolished. The FBI  
should be punished, too, since Director Louis Freeh's statement that the  
Bureau is now better prepared for "volatile situations like Ruby Ridge" is  
a totally inadequate response.  
  <P>
Former Attorney General Edwin Meese points out in the current issue of  
Policy Review that the Ruby Ridge and Waco (Branch Davidian) tragedies have  
fundamentally changed the way Americans view federal law enforcement  
agencies and have jeopardized public confidence in government itself. His  
recommendation is much more fundamental than a mere transfer of agency  
functions and suspension of several agents.  
  <P>
As Meese explains, Ruby Ridge and Waco were, constitutionally speaking,  
none of the Federal government's business in the first place. Neither  
incident involved interstate activity or posed a threat to the Federal  
Government.  
  <P>
The underlying problem is that so many criminal laws and laws regulating  
firearms have been federalized. Until very recent years, everything  
involved at Ruby Ridge and Waco would have been handled under state and  
local laws (if, indeed, there were anything to handle at all, since the  
Ruby Ridge sequence of events only started when a BATF agent entrapped  
Randy Weaver into committing a minor violation of a firearms law).  
  <P>
What has happened is that so many politicians, seeking to portray  
themselves as tough on crime, have passed so many laws creating new federal  
crimes and stiffer penalties. They should know that these laws are not in  
harmony with our Constitution and that crime is most effectively fought at  
the local level, anyway.  
  <P>
Meese explains that federalizing crime contradicts constitutional  
principles. The U.S. Constitution gave Congress jurisdiction over only  
three crimes: treason, counterfeiting, and piracy on the high seas and  
offenses against the law of nations. Responsibility for public safety rests  
solely in the domain of the states.  
  <P>
Now, however, Congress has created more than 3,000 federal crimes, many of  
them redundant with state laws. Hardly any crime, no matter how local, is  
now beyond the jurisdiction of federal criminal authorities.  
  <P>
A big part of the federalizing of crime is the criminalization of  
environmental regulations. Many of these federal environmental crimes are  
local in nature, and they are often so vague that some property owners  
violate the law without realizing it.  
  <P>
Meese accurately says that federalizing crime increases "the potential for  
an oppressive and burdensome federal police state." Ruby Ridge and Waco  
prove that proposition; the spokesmen for the two federal agencies never  
admitted that the government did anything wrong.  
  <P>
Another bad result of federalizing crime is the added jurisdiction and  
power this gives to the federal courts. Activist federal judges have  
greatly expanded the rights of criminal defendants, have further burdened  
law- enforcement agencies, and have virtually taken over the operation of  
80 percent of all state prison systems.  
  <P>
Since crime usually tops the list when voters are asked what they are  
concerned about, Republicans like to pose as law-and-order spokesmen. Its  
time for them to address themselves to the real problems that are properly  
Congress's responsibility, and admit that law-and-order is a state and  
local function.

<h2>Kudos For General Dan "SDI" Graham </h2>
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><P>
Can one person really make a difference in this country of 250,000,000  
people? The life of General Daniel O. Graham, who passed away on New Year's  
Eve, gives a stunningly affirmative answer.<br>  
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dan Graham, whose first love was the cavalry, liked to quote an old  
proverb. For want of a nail, the shoe was lost; for want of the shoe, the  
horse was lost; for want of the horse, the battle was lost. <br> 
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That proverb defines his place in history. For want of Dan Graham, Ronald  
Reagan would not have had the vision of a defense against ballistic  
missiles called the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI); for want of  
Reagan's leadership, the United States would not have had a project called  
SDI; and for want of the SDI project and the threat of what it could do,  
the Cold War would have been lost.<br>  
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is now clear that we won the Cold War when Mikhail Gorbachev reluctantly  
concluded that he couldn't talk Reagan out of SDI (at Geneva or elsewhere),  
and that the miserable Soviet economy couldn't match U.S. expenditures for  
building a nuclear defense. When Reagan called on Gorbachev to tear down  
the Berlin Wall, the media laughed; but SDI turned that "pie-in-the-sky"  
prediction into reality.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Democratic-controlled Congresses never voted the funds to deploy SDI,  
but they did tolerate limited funding for research and development.  
Fortunately that (combined with the collapsing Soviet economy) turned out  
to be enough to checkmate Gorbachev. <br> 
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;General Graham had a much-decorated 30-year military career that included  
service in Germany, Korea and Vietnam and was capped by serving as director  
of the Defense Intelligence Agency. In retirement, he rejected lucrative  
offers from defense contractors and dedicated his life to American national  
defense.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Ronald Reagan's military adviser in his 1976 and 1980 campaigns, Dan  
Graham laid out for his candidate the folly and culpable negligence of the  
Federal Government's leaving America totally undefended against incoming  
nuclear missiles. Graham's coaching led Ronald Reagan to articulate the  
crucial question on March 23, 1983: "Would it not be better to save lives  
than to avenge them?"  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's national grand strategy, developed by Secretary of Defense Robert  
McNamara in the early 1960s, was still in 1983 totally based on killing  
Russians instead of on protecting the lives of Americans. This strategy,  
called Mutual Assured Destruction, was known by its appropriate acronym  
MAD.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This theory proclaimed the notion that the way to avoid nuclear war was (a)  
not to build any defensive weapons, but instead (b) to threaten the Soviets  
that, if they fired their nuclear missiles at us, we would retaliate with  
our offensive nukes and kill tens of millions of Russians. If this scenario  
ever took place, tens of millions of Americans would die because our  
government had done nothing at all to protect them.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;MAD was a suicide pact -- a strategy of revenge, rather than defense. Dan  
Graham said there must be a better way.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The better way developed by Graham was originally called High Frontier  
(because space is the high frontier of America's future), and was later  
called SDI. It is a plan for a layered defense, in which non-nuclear  
weapons shot from satellites in space and from ground bases in this country  
would destroy enemy nuclear missiles in flight before they incinerated  
Americans.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dan Graham had the vision that a defense was both essential and doable, he  
was the salesman who persuaded Ronald Reagan and other public officials and  
opinion makers that it was sound political and military strategy, he  
assembled the scientists and engineers who proved it would work, he raised  
the funds to do all of the above, and he was a veritable machine grinding  
out refutations of the attacks launched on High Frontier/SDI by those  
determined to mislead the public with deceptive criticisms.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;General Graham had to fend off the Ted Kennedy claque who tried to ridicule  
High Frontier as "Star Wars," and the liberal Democrats who are viscerally  
opposed to spending any money on defense. Graham had to withstand  
opposition from Paul Nitze and the internationalists who opposed SDI  
because they sought nuclear disarmament through international agencies, and  
from the arms control lobby, which had a vested interest in continuing  
their jobs attending international meetings where they tilted about arcane  
nuclear weapons statistics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A couple of weeks ago, President Clinton vetoed the defense authorization  
which funded SDI, claiming that it is "on a collision course with the ABM  
treaty." That document is a relic of the Cold War, which continues to  
impose MAD on us and restricts our constitutional right to "provide for the  
common defense."  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The nuclear threat today is from attacks by the several rogue nations that  
now possess ballistic missiles. The ABM treaty cannot protect us against  
them, but SDI can.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Where there is no vision, the people perish." General Daniel O. Graham had  
the vision for a "Defense that Defends." As a fitting tribute to a great  
patriot, let us work to make it a reality.

<h2>The Fraud and the Failure Called Welfare </h2>

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a>

<p><P>
The disaster called welfare was probably the biggest single issue that 
ousted the Democratic majority in Congress in the landmark election of 
1994. Even President Clinton said he wanted to "end welfare as we know it." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True to their Contract with America, the Republican Congress passed welfare 
reform. It wasn't a perfect piece of legislation, of course. There is no 
way this $5 trillion fraud and failure, with so many vested interests, 
could be perfected by one law in one year. But it was a giant step in the 
right direction. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Clinton vetoed the welfare reform bill, so we're back to square one. 
The federal taxpayers will have to go on spending $234 billion annually, 
plus another $100 billion in state welfare spending.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lyndon Johnson's Great Society set up a grossly unjust and immoral system 
in the mid-1960s whereby millions of people were taught that they had an 
"entitlement." They became "entitled" to pick the pockets of lawabiding, 
taxpaying families if they met two conditions: they didn't work, and they 
were not married to someone who does work. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The major problem is that welfare pays better than jobs that welfare 
recipients can hope to get. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A recent Cato Institute study laid out comparative figures based on the 
cash payments and non-cash benefits paid by our welfare system to a single 
mother with two children. There are 77 different sources of welfare money, 
but the principal pipelines are AFDC, food stamps, medicaid, housing, 
utilities, WIC, and commodities. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In eight states, the average welfare mother receives cash and benefits 
amounting to $20,000 a year. In medium-level welfare states, she gets 
$17,500 per year. And it's all tax-free! 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 39 states, welfare benefits are equivalent to an $8 per hour job. In New 
York and Washington, D.C., welfare benefits are equivalent to a $12 an hour 
job, two and a half times the minimum wage. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In eight states, welfare benefits are equivalent to the salary of a 
first-year teacher. In 28 states, welfare benefits are equivalent to the 
pay of a starting secretary. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, all welfare recipients don't receive this much, but some get 
more. The conclusion is that it pays to be on welfare and there is no real 
hope of getting people off welfare until the benefits are less than a 
minimum wage job. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When LBJ started the current welfare system, it was called the "war on 
poverty." Indeed, it was a war against families, taxpayers, and even 
against the people it was supposed to help. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It's bad enough that the war on poverty took so much spendable income out 
of the pockets of hard-working Americans. It's worse that it is a no-win 
war, initiated by the same Administration that gave us the Vietnam War. We 
are waiting for its perpetrators to admit, like Robert S. McNamara, that 
they were "wrong, terribly wrong." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the worst of it is that the liberal welfare system has perpetrated such 
horrendous damage on our society. It has broken up millions of families, 
prevented more millions of families from forming, produced seven million 
illegitimate children, created a pathetic underclass that will never 
achieve what we like to call the American Dream, virtually destroyed our 
great cities, and spawned the social problems that flow from illegitimacy 
such as drugs, delinquency, and dropouts. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The welfare system tells a teenage girl, who is doing poorly in school, 
doesn't know who her father is, isn't getting along with her mother, and 
hates her surroundings, "We'll take you out of all this, set you up in an 
apartment of your own, send you a check every month, and give you your own 
food stamps, housing allotment, health care, and commodities. All you have 
to do to get all these goodies is have an illegitimate baby." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Surprise, surprise, more illegitimate babies were born to teenagers. So the liberals offered another government "solution": "family planning." That's a 
euphemism for the massive distribution of contraceptives.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Title X taxpayer funding started in 1970 for the purpose of reducing 
unmarried teen pregnancies. After 25 years, the result is total disaster; 
every measure of teenage health is dramatically worse. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Illegitimate births to teenagers have doubled, the teenage abortion rate 
has more than doubled, sexual activity rates are far higher and at a 
younger age, and sexually transmitted diseases have skyrocketed. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the liberals whine about how the so-called Religious Right is 
"imposing its morals" on the rest of society, remember that they are like 
the thief who cries "stop, thief" to distract from his own thievery. 
Welfare is the prime example of the Irreligious Left imposing its lack of 
morals on the rest of society.

<h2>
The Road Map To Real Reform In Education 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly 
</a>

<P>  
Every now and then a book comes along, such as Rachel Carson's "Silent 
Spring" or Ralph Nader's "Unsafe At Any Speed," that dramatically alters 
the focus of an entire industry. "Teaching Our Children to Read" by Bill 
Honig can be such a book. It could change our entire educational system, 
not because the book will be a best-seller, but because of the author's 
credibility among educators. 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig is no hero to conservatives, or to disaffected parents demanding 
school choice, or even to critics demanding school "standards" and 
"reform." He was State Superintendent of Public Instruction for California, 
1983-1993, where he presided over a school system that exemplified all the 
failures and abuses we've been complaining about for years. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Apparently, when he left office two years ago, Honig sincerely set about to 
find out why public schoolchildren are not learning how to read. He started 
from the reasonable assumption that "the first and foremost job of 
elementary school is to teach children to read." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most important point Honig makes, repeated at least a dozen times, is 
that a child absolutely must be "reading beginning books by mid-first 
grade." Honig emphasizes that those who miss out in the early first grade 
need "organized intervention" immediately, because otherwise they "almost 
never recover." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reading success depends on the child developing the ability to pick out the 
smallest "sound chunks" that make up words. Honig says that "the amount of 
time a student is engaged in phonics instruction is highly predictive of 
subsequent reading achievement." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The discipline manifested in Honig's book is extraordinary. It contains no 
confessions, no mea culpas, no I-told-you-sos, no recriminations, no 
put-downs, no pejoratives, no assessing of credit or blame, no targeting of 
enemies, no sanctimonious self- righteousness. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig's book is just a straightforward explanation, based on voluminous 
research and empirical evidence, of how children can and should be taught 
to read. It's a fair inference that its message is a plea for the schools 
to get going on this task because, if the schools fail in this preeminent 
mission, nothing else matters. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A Great Debate has been going on for years between the advocates of phonics 
(i.e., teaching the child to sound out the syllables of the English 
language and put them together like building blocks) and the advocates of 
Whole Language (i.e., teaching the child to guess at the words by looking 
at the pictures and to substitute words that fit the context of the story). 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig calls the phonics-Whole Language debate a "destructive controversy," 
asserts that it should not be an "either/or" question, and recommends a 
"balanced" approach. This is a skillful way of assuring that semantics do 
not screen out the meat of his presentation. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He bows to the Whole Language movement, crediting it with introducing 
children to "good literature." But Honig reminds us that exposure to good 
literature "only works if the student actually reads the words correctly -- 
making mistakes doesn't help." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then, Honig exposes the Whole Language myth that the child will learn 
"naturally," without explicit instruction in skills, in the same way that a 
child learns to talk. He says this false belief is far too prevalent and 
has had the "disastrous" result that 30% to 40% of urban children can't 
read at all and more than 50% can't read at their grade level. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig explains that "bad habits of guessing" make learning to read much 
more difficult, and these bad habits cannot be remedied by a sporadic, 
unsystematic use of phonics. He says that "beginning readers who rely too 
heavily on contextual clues, such as pictures or the connection of other 
words in the passage, are distracted from looking at the letters in a word 
and connecting those letter patterns to words in their minds." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig argues for teaching children to write and to spell accurately in the 
first grade, too. "Inventive spelling" shouldn't be allowed past mid-first 
grade; children's misspellings should be corrected so erroneous patterns 
are not reinforced. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How widespread are wrong teaching methods in public schools today? Honig 
says that "very few instructional programs currently in use provide 
children with materials designed specifically to connect with systematic 
and sequenced skills development. In some cases, state, county, district, 
or university leaders are overtly or subtly antagonistic to the skills 
components and discourage phonics teaching." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This isn't a book for parents. Honig obviously thinks that parents have no 
direct role in the mechanics of teaching children to read because that's 
the job for the public school. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides, most parents won't be able to cope with his endless educrat 
jargon: phonological awareness and processing, phonemic segmentation, 
explicit skill development strand, word-attack skills, alphabetic 
principle, orthographic phase, syntactic awareness, and metacognitional and 
strategic assistance. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But this highfalutin way of talking about phonics is just right for 
teachers, administrators and policymakers. It's a road map to get them back 
on the track of teaching children how to read, which should be the schools' 
number-one mission.

<title>Schlafly: The Feminists Seek Unfair and Unattainable Goals -- 2/15/96</title>

<h2>
The Feminists Seek Unfair and Unattainable Goals
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
The aging feminist leaders gathered in Washington earlier this month amid
self-doubts about whether they are relevant any more. "We want to end this
discussion about the death of feminism," proclaimed the organizer of this
Feminist Expo '96 and its most voluble spokesperson, Eleanor Smeal.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Feminism is in its death throes because it seeks unattainable goals at
variance with reality, common sense, and fairness. In the 1970s and 1980s,
the feminists sought a "gender-neutral" society; their goal was to be
treated exactly like men.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The feminist "party line" today is obsessed with victimology as the problem
and affirmative action as the solution: they see the world as one gigantic
male conspiracy against women. The feminists' goal is reverse
discrimination quotas for women in hiring and promotions.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We hear endless whining about "equal pay for equal work," but that's been
the law of the land for 33 years. What they really want is reverse
discrimination quotas to give women equal pay for unequal work.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The feminists use "Glass Ceiling" as a code word for quotas for
professional and executive women, and "comparable worth" as the code word
for quotas for skilled white and blue collar jobs. (Unskilled jobs are
never on the feminists' radar screen.)
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The feminists' mantra is, "a woman earns only 72 cents for every dollar a
man earns." That statement is false on its face, first, because of the
dishonest use of the word "every." It might be correct if the sentence
read, "The average woman earns 72 percent of the earnings of the average
man," but that would be meaningless because it's unrelated to how much work
the average man or woman does.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Americans don't believe in equal pay for everyone (that's a Marxist
notion). We believe in equal pay for equal work.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When you relate earnings to work performed, male and female gender profiles
are very different. A recent research paper by the Pacific Research
Institute of San Francisco provides overwhelmingly persuasive
documentation.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The slogans "wives have to work" and "it takes two incomes to support a
family today" obscure public understanding of the powerful effect that
marriage has on workforce earnings, and 81 percent of women do marry. As
the scholar Thomas Sowell has shown, marriage has exactly the opposite
effect on the earnings of men and women.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Married men with children earn the most, while married women with children
earn the least. As the number of children increases, a married man works
more hours in the workforce and a married woman works fewer hours.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1994 only 55% of women worked 40 or more hours a week compared to 75% of
men. While 16% of men worked 55 or more hours a week, only 6% of women did.
It's ridiculous to compare earnings without relating them to whether
produced by full-time or part-time employment.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For the benefit of feminists who need to have the obvious stated: people
who work more earn more, and they should. The principal income gap is not
between women and men, but between married women and everyone else, and
that is primarily the result of a voluntary domestic division of labor, not
labor-force discrimination by a conspiracy of men. Women who remain single,
invest in education, stay in the labor force, and work long hours fare
about as well as men in the labor market.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The feminists' next line of attack is to assert that, even when you compare
levels of education, or highest college level attained, Bureau of Labor
Statistics figures show a sizeable differential (they call it
discrimination) between men's and women's earnings. But comparing incomes
by the highest degree earned reveals individual choices made by women, and
correlation does not prove cause.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1992, one out of four women who earned Ph.D.s did so in education,
whereas one out of five men earned a Ph.D. in engineering. The mean monthly
income of education majors is $3,048, and of engineering graduates is
$4,049 (a third higher). Personal choices produced those results; no
gestapo forced women to major in fields that pay less.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Looking at master's and doctor's degrees conferred in 1992, we find that
women earned 75% of the advanced degrees in education, 65% in English
literature, and 63% in ethnic and cultural studies. Men earned 85% of the
advanced degrees in engineering, 75% in physical sciences and science
technologies, and 60% in mathematics.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As of 1990, women held 73% of all college degrees in education, 61% of
degrees in liberal arts and humanities, and 81% of degrees in nursing and
pharmacy. Men held 91% of degrees in engineering, 74% in physical and earth
sciences, and 67% of degrees in mathematics and statistics.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All professions have costs and benefits, pluses and minuses. Investment
bankers make more money than school teachers, but teachers have frequent
and much longer vacations.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The proper role of government is to provide equal protection of the laws
and opportunity, not preferential treatment based on warped social theory,
especially when that theory is so demonstrably false.

<h2>
Games and Tricks of the New World Order
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
schlafly

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
It's becoming clear that "New World Order" is not just a fantasy of 
conspiracy-minded rightwingers. President George Bush popularized its use 
in 1990 in order to legitimize the Gulf War by resuscitating the 
then-moribund United Nations. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like Saddam Hussein, the New World Order concept survived the Gulf War 
intact, and now we're seeing the unintended consequences. New World Order 
is a handy label to describe the various policies that are challenging our 
sovereignty, trying to bore into our bank account, and turning over U.S. 
service personnel to the U.N. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The World Trade Organization (WTO), which the United States officially 
joined when Congress ratified the GATT treaty in its lame-duck session in 
December 1994, recently ruled against the United States in its first case. 
Why is anybody surprised! This result was widely predicted. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The adverse WTO ruling is embarrassing to President Clinton and his U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who had promised the liberals that the 
WTO would never diminish our environmental regulations. It's just as 
embarrassing to the Republican leadership in Congress who promised 
conservatives that such an attack on our sovereign right to make our own 
laws would never happen. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
At issue was the Clean Air Act's strict limits on pollutants in gasoline, 
which Venezuela and Brazil were unable to meet. In the name of "free 
trade," they took their complaint to the WTO and won. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Since the United States does not export gasoline to Venezuela or Brazil, in 
the name of "free trade" the WTO can now order "cross- retaliation" trade 
sanctions against other U.S. industries that are wholly unrelated to the 
gasoline industry or the EPA regulations. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It was the 1994 GATT treaty that made this adverse ruling and unfair 
punishment possible. The old GATT did not allow it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The second New World Order item is the announcement by UN Secretary-General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali in London that he wants to finance the nearly 
bankrupt United Nations by imposing a global tax on foreign exchange 
transactions. A tiny rate of 0.5 percent would produce an incredible $1.5 
trillion, while a minuscule rate of 0.05 percent would produce $150 
billion. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Another global tax he is toying with that would produce billions of dollars 
is a surcharge of $1.50 on all international airline tickets. It turns out 
that one of the chief promoters of these far-out notions is the 
Clinton-appointed administrator of the UN Development Program, James 
Gustave Speth. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some claim that Boutros-Ghali is floating the global tax in order to shame 
the United States into paying the $1.4 billion the U.N. claims we owe. Some 
are suggesting that, if we don't pay up, the U.N. should cut off our U.N. 
voting rights, hit us with late- payment charges, and impose a ban on 
hiring U.S. citizens for U.N. jobs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But Americans don't think they are getting their money's worth from our 
payments to the U.N. Our assessments are 25 percent of the regular U.N. 
budget and 31 percent of the peacekeeping costs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The third New World Order item is the court-martial and conviction of an 
American soldier, Army Specialist Michael New, for refusing to wear the UN 
uniform on a so-called "peacekeeping" expedition to Macedonia. The other 
550 servicemen in his unit donned UN helmets, replaced their U.S. I.D. card 
with a U.N. I.D. card, and dutifully marched off to Macedonia, where 
Americans have no business being in the first place. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When Specialist New's commander gave the U.N.-uniform order to the 550 
troops on October 2, 1995 in Schweinfurt, Germany, the only authority he 
cited consisted of "UN guidelines," "National Command Authority," "UN 
Charter," "Domestic Law," "Commander in Chief," and "UN Security Council 
Resolutions." He mocked objections to the U.N. baby-blue helmets by saying, 
"They look fabulous." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Actually, the baby-blue UN helmets don't look either military or masculine. 
Maybe that's why they have been seen only very fleetingly on American 
television. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
New argued that the order to alter his uniform was a violation of the 
Army's regulation against wearing any unauthorized insignia, decoration, 
medal or uniform. He said, "I am not a U.N. soldier. I am an American 
soldier." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
You have to wonder why the Clinton Administration didn't simply reassign 
New to some other duty, since the twice-decorated soldier has an exemplary 
record and was willing to obey any order to go anywhere in the world so 
long as he could wear a U.S. uniform. But no, Clinton was determined to 
carry out this first step in transforming American soldiers into U.N. 
soldiers and wouldn't let one soldier stand in his way. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Congressman Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD) calls Specialist New an American hero 
and has been joined by at least 60 other Congressmen in co- sponsoring a 
bill to declare it unlawful to require a member of the U.S. Armed Services 
to wear insignia, indicia or headgear indicating any allegiance to or 
affiliation with the United Nations. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
All the Republican Presidential candidates should be addressing these New 
World Order issues.

<h2>
 Buchanan Knows Where the Votes Are
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly 
</a>

<P>  
The Inside the Beltway pundits and others who think they are movers and
shakers of the establishment are wracking their brains to try to figure out
why Pat Buchanan has such an enthusiastic following. His social
conservatism is part of the reason, but there is another part they don't
understand.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The day after the Iowa caucuses, I received a subscription appeal from the
Wall Street Journal. Let me share it with you.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"On a beautiful late spring afternoon, 25 years ago, two young men
graduated from the same college. They were very much alike, these two young
men. Both had been better than average students, both were personable, and
both were filled with ambitious dreams for the future.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Recently, these men returned to their college for their 25th reunion. They
were still very much alike. Both were happily married. Both had three
children. Both had gone to work for the same midwestern manufacturing
company after graduation, and were still there.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"But there was a difference. One of the men was manager of a small
department of that company. The other was its president.''
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The letter's sales talk conveyed the impression (although it didn't say so)
that the difference between the one man's mediocre job and the other man's
rise to the top was that he had the benefit of the information in the Wall
Street Journal.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president of the company reads the Wall Street Journal for all the
business news he needs on technology, competition and marketing around the
world. He can track his investments on easy-to-scan market quotations.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Wall Street Journal speaks to and for those successful businessmen, and
it should. Entrepreneurs are great people; they make America prosperous by
investing their savings in plant expansion and in creating new jobs.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It may be that the guy who didn't rise any higher than middle management,
or who is a blue-collar worker, had less smarts or opportunity or energy or
perseverance, but he is an American, too, and he expected to share in the
American dream of a rising standard of living. But his real wages haven't
risen in ten years, and now he lives in fear and dread of losing his job
altogether if his manufacturing plant is relocated overseas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are tens of thousands more of these guys than there are of the
bosses. The Wall Street Journal doesn't speak for them, but Pat Buchanan
does.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, he is the only presidential candidate of either party who speaks
for them (Bill Clinton, who never had any contact with real life in the
working world, is bragging about the rise in the stock market), and that's
why Buchanan's campaign is rising like a rocket. He is changing the
Republican Party from Wall Street to Main Street.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Before the Iowa caucuses, the other presidential candidates never appeared
to care about or want this immense constituency of working Americans.
Chanting the mantra "free trade,'' their attitude toward displaced workers
was, "Tough! That's the breaks in a free market. We live in a global
economy, and you need to look for another job.''
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The other Presidential candidates, as well as the Republican leadership in
Congress, all backed Clinton on NAFTA, GATT, the Mexican bailout, and
sending American troops to Bosnia. It is ridiculous to think that any
Republican who agrees with Bill Clinton on those gut issues about jobs and
American sovereignty can defeat him in November.<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whoever advised the 
Republican leadership in Congress to make "a balanced
budget in seven years with CBO numbers'' and government- regulated HMOs for
Medicare the 1995-96 Republican legislative goals must have been a
double-agent for Bill Clinton. The former is unintelligible to the voters
and the latter is unacceptable to seniors, so adopting those as goals
served up an immense public relations victory to Clinton.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Wall Street Journal and conservative publications that like to give
advice to Republicans are saying that the Party must "integrate the views''
of the two blocs in the conservative movement, the social and the economic
(a.k.a. the balanced budget bloc). They have it all wrong; the balanced
budget is irrelevant at the grass roots.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To win against Clinton, the Republican candidate must get the votes of the
Reagan Democrats, those pro-life, pro-family, working-class Democrats who
voted for Reagan, whom George Bush kicked away. To win against Clinton, the
Republican candidate must get the votes of the Perot voters, the
independent voters who oppose NAFTA and GATT and favor term limits and
campaign reform.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The conservative publications that supported NAFTA, GATT, the failed
balanced-budget strategy, and Clinton-lite health care "reform,'' feel
threatened by Buchanan's success. That's why they have started a campaign
of invective and epithets on a scale unseen in American politics since the
Barry Goldwater campaign of 1964.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Bob Dole got to New Hampshire, he ran negative TV ads attacking
Buchanan at the same time that he adopted Buchanan's winning rhetoric when
talking to the voters. Dole attacked the reduction in real average hourly
wages and tax increases on family income and said, "Corporate profits are
setting records and so are corporate layoffs.''
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Buchanan knows where the votes are. The others are just starting to find
out, but they are hopelessly compromised by their long record of supporting
Clinton's disastrous foreign and domestic policies.

<title>Schlafly:  Look Out For Union Politicking In Congressional Campaigns  -- 3/7/96</title>

<h2>
Look Out For Union Politicking In Congressional Campaigns
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly 
</a>

<P>  
The theater of the presidential primaries is tending to obscure the fact 
that the fight is already on in earnest for control of the next Congress. 
The victory of a liberal Democrat for U.S. Senator from Oregon to fill the 
seat vacated by Bob Packwood may prove anew the truth of the old adage that 
&quot;Coming events cast their shadows before them.&quot; 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The political director of the AFL-CIO bragged that his union had sent 37 
full-time campaign workers to Oregon to work for Democrat Ron Wyden and to 
attack the Republican on key issues such as Medicare. The union made more 
than 230,000 phone calls and sent out more than 350,000 pieces of mail on 
behalf of the Democratic candidate. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It wasn't just the AFL-CIO. At least eleven other individual unions joined 
forces to bring in $183,000 in political action committee donations. That 
made a mighty big presence in one targeted campaign. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
PAC spending is only part of what the unions are doing in Congressional 
races. The unions' phone banks, direct mail, paid advertising, and 
grassroots organizing are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars more than 
the direct donations reported to the Federal Election Committee. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Much of this union politicking is financed through mandatory worker dues, 
and much is unreported and unregulated by federal election laws. To use a 
favorite political metaphor, union support is a ten-ton gorilla in 
Congressional elections. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Oregon race is the start of a massive campaign to use leftwing, liberal 
political muscle in targeted races in order to undo the Republican 
victories of 1994. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The AFL-CIO has announced plans to spend $35 million to defeat 75 
Republican Congressmen in the 1996 November elections. This is seven times 
more than the union usually spends in federal elections and does not even 
include the millions more spent by individual unions, or the so-called 
&quot;soft money&quot; and the &quot;volunteer&quot; political campaigning done by union 
members. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The unions have suffered many years of declining influence. John Sweeney 
won election as AFL-CIO President last year by promising not only an 
aggressive campaign to increase union membership, but also a vocal 
political campaign to promote the union's liberal agenda. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Education Association (NEA), one of the most powerful of all 
the individual unions, has targeted 42 Republican Congressmen for defeat. 
According to the NEA's own press release, the NEA will run &quot;a grassroots 
organizing drive&quot; and a media ad campaign accusing these Congressmen of 
&quot;cutting off our children's future.&quot; 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The NEA has already spent $4.75 million on a multi-media ad campaign 
designed to scare voters about Medicare and Goals 2000 reductions. This 
lavish campaign was targeted in 55 Congressional districts and included 
press conferences, leafleting, and phone banks. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's unfortunate that Congress, by a slight margin, failed to abolish the 
preferential property tax exemption enjoyed exclusively by the National 
Education Association. No other union has this unique financial advantage. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The polls indicate that the public is blaming the Republican Congress for 
not getting much of anything done last year. In fact, President Clinton 
deserves most of the blame because he vetoed a perfectly reasonable 
Balanced Budget Act and also a perfectly reasonable compromise welfare 
reform bill. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The members of Congress most at risk from the AFL-CIO assault are the 
freshmen who came to Washington determined to cut government down to size. 
They are our hope for a conservative Congress in the future. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is a freshman Congressman who is leading the battle to abolish the 
Department of Education. It is a freshman Congressman who is championing 
the cause of the brave U.S. soldier (Michael New) who refused to wear a 
United Nations uniform. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It was a freshman Congressman who dared to push for a vote on the Mexican 
bailout. It was a freshman Congressman who stopped the totalitarian 
anti-terrorism bill (to give Janet Reno the power to wiretap all our 
telephones.) 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It was freshmen Congressmen who voted against Clinton's unconstitutional 
sending of U.S. troops into the war in Bosnia. It is freshmen Congressmen 
who are working for campaign spending reform and term limits. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These are the Congressmen you will hear the media complaining about as 
&quot;obstructionists&quot; and &quot;extremists.&quot; That's because they are daring to 
challenge business as usual and have a real dedication to doing what the 
voters sent them to Washington to do. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You can bet that the freshmen members of Congress will be the ones targeted 
for defeat by the big money and organizational muscle of the liberal 
unions.

<title>Schlafly: The Great Awakening About Jobs -- 3/14/96</title>

<h2>
The Great Awakening About Jobs
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
schlafly

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
When Bob Dole said in New Hampshire, "I didn't realize that jobs and trade 
and what makes America work would become a big issue in the last few days 
of this campaign," he revealed the cloistered mindset of government 
officials who have relative job security backed up by a golden parachute. 
Now, the New York Times has had a similar epiphany, reporting the same 
discovery to its readers in a five-newspaper-page article starting with 
five columns on the front page. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To most families across America, it's old news that jobs are the premier 
issue. The media only discovered it when it became a factor in the 
presidential campaign. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Times now admits that nearly three quarters of all households have had 
a close encounter with layoffs since 1980. One-third of American households 
have had a family member who lost a job, and another 40 percent know a 
relative, friend or neighbor who was laid off. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Doesn't it strike you as remarkable that the elite press is just 
discovering something that is an issue with three-fourths of American 
families? Maybe the media were just snowed by President Clinton's bragging 
in his State of the Union Message that our economy is "the healthiest it 
has been in three decades." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Actually, newspaper headlines have been spelling out the news for several 
years: 123,000 laid off by AT&T, 18,800 by Delta Airlines, 16,800 by 
Eastman Kodak, 50,000 by Sears, 20,000 by DEC. It isn't just blue-collar 
manufacturing jobs that are disappearing, it's white-collar and 
middle-management jobs, too. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In an earlier generation, most people who were laid off found jobs that 
paid roughly as well as their old jobs. That doesn't happen, now. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Prior to the New Hampshire primary, the attitude of most presidential 
wannabes, politicians, pundits had been to recite the mantras "Free trade 
is wonderful; we have to complete in a global economy; and get yourself 
retrained for a new job." It's now clear that competing in a global economy 
does not improve our quality of life in America but lowers it, and buying a 
cheaper computer can't compensate for losing your job. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The politicians have been saying that the answer to layoffs, as well as to 
the fact that the median wage in America today, adjusted for inflation, is 
nearly three percent below what it was in 1979, is "training and 
education." That's become a code word for creating more taxpayer-financed 
"job-training" programs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But many of the victims of large layoffs are fully educated and trained. 
The majority of those laid off have at least some college education. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Lockheed, Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas have been laying off aerospace 
engineers. IBM, Compaq and Apple have been laying off systems analysts and 
software programmers. The automobile industry has been laying off skilled 
machine tool operators and automotive engineers. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Many of these men and women will never find another job in their area of 
expertise or at anywhere near their past salaries. If education and 
re-training are the answer, what should they be trained for? Half of those 
who received Ph.D.'s in mathematics last year did not find fulltime 
employment within a year of graduation. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And, if these educated workers cannot find meaningful re- employment in 
their industries, prospects are even bleaker for blue-collar workers and 
others without marketable skills. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition to the financial setback, there is an enormous human cost of 
layoffs when there is no prospect of a new job anything on a par with the 
old one. This includes acute humiliation in front of your loved ones and 
friends, marriage breakup, withdrawal from volunteer community service, and 
being uprooted from your home town and forced to move elsewhere. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Technological progress is the cause of many of these layoffs. Of course, we 
have to progress from horse and buggies to automobiles, from kerosine lamps 
to electric appliances, and from typewriters and carbon paper to computers 
and copy machines. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But more and more people have realized that another major cause of this 
disruption and downsizing is the incessant and orchestrated demand that 
America compete in a global economy with hundreds of millions of unemployed 
and under-employed people around the world who are willing to work for 25 
cents an hour. That's what "free trade" means, and there's nothing fair 
about it.

<h2>
Political Slush Funds
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
The media are persistently presenting us with reports that voters are 
"angry," usually with the implication that this condition is the voters' 
fault and is some kind of a national problem like a social disease. The 
Heritage Foundation, in a document called "Top Ten Political Slush Funds," 
has now given us chapter and verse to justify plenty of anger on the part 
of the voters. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This Heritage document sets forth dozens upon dozens of private groups that 
are on the federal dole for millions of dollars of our taxpayers' money, 
part of which they use to lobby and politic for their own special-interest 
causes. Just to call the roll makes anybody angry at the way Congress, over 
the years of one-party Democratic rule, has extorted our hard-earned money 
through income taxes and distributed it among their liberal friends. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Efforts to restrict this welfare for lobbyists last year through the 
Istook-McIntosh Amendment were drowned under the hysterical lobbying of 
these corporate welfare recipients. Their advocacy of bigger government, 
higher spending, and increased government regulation has continued 
unabated. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) has been giving away our 
money for many years to a long list of liberal and feminist outfits, of 
which the most egregious was NEH Chair Lynne Cheney's $2 million grant to 
UCLA that produced the notorious leftwing revisionist National History 
Standards. The NEH has given other taxpayer grants to such special-interest 
groups as the American Bar Association, the American Library Association, 
and the National Council on Aging. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The current NEH Chair, Sheldon Hackney, has started a stream of tax dollars 
flowing to something called "National Conversation." Only an ivory-tower 
liberal could, with a straight face, argue that Americans need federal 
funding and intervention in order to engage in "conversation," so you can 
bet in what political direction this conversation will be led. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Market Promotion Program gives taxpayer handouts to trade organizations 
to advertise U.S. products in foreign countries. Of course, parts of their 
grants are used to lobby against reductions in agricultural subsidies, all the while they are mouthing the mantra "free trade." 
Here is a tiny sampling of these taxpayer grants: $7 million to the Meat 
Export Federation, $6 million to Cotton Council International, $5 million 
each to the Poultry and Egg Export Council and to the Wine Institute, $4 
million to Florida Citrus, $3 million to the California Almond Board, $2 
million each to the Pillsbury Company and the Mink Export Council. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) funnels 400 million federal tax 
dollars to 323 private groups around the country, most of which engage in 
political and lobbying activities. These tax-paid lawyers file lawsuits, 
engage in political advocacy, and work in referendum campaigns to prevent 
welfare reform, to promote racial preferences, to provide tax benefits to 
illegal immigrants and felons, and even to prevent the eviction of drug 
dealers from public housing. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The taxpayers are forced to fund Planned Parenthood to the tune of at least 
$189 million. Much of this money goes in direct grants to state chapters of 
Planned Parenthood that typically deal with abortion and engage in 
legislative and political advocacy. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Numerous liberal lobbying organizations that pretend to advocate the 
interests of seniors have figured out to get themselves on the dole for 
large amounts of taxpayers money. These include $69 million to American 
Association of Retired Persons (AARP), $61 million to the National Council 
of Senior Citizens, and $38 million to the National Council on Aging. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
AARP is one of the country's largest and wealthiest private lobbying 
organizations and doesn't need tax-funded charity. It lobbied actively for 
Clinton's socialized health care bill in 1994, even though AARP's internal 
surveys showed that most seniors opposed it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Grants to an endless list of private organizations are concealed in the 
fine print of the federal budget under such high sounding titles as Senior 
Environmental Employment Program ($45 million), Superfund Worker Training 
Program ($32 million), HHS Discretionary Aging Projects ($26 million), and 
Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance ($25 million). 
These political slush funds include handouts to some of the richest 
advocacy organizations in the country, including the American Bar 
Association and the American Medical Association. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some of the wealthiest national unions are on the gravy train, too. The 
Laborers Union gets $8 million, the Carpenters $4 million, the Chemical 
Workers $3 million, the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers $3 million, the 
Operating Engineers and the Teamsters each get $2 million, and the Auto 
Workers $1 million. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Americans are tired of hearing talk about the goal of "a balanced budget in 
seven years," and tired of the bleeding-heart Democratic rhetoric 
complaining that "budget cuts hurt seniors and children." It is an outrage 
that Congress has failed to eliminate all welfare to private advocacy 
groups of all kinds.

<h2>
Why Do They Call It "Free Trade"?
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
Why do some people persist in mouthing the mantra "free trade" when foreign 
countries can and do engage in all sorts of dishonest tactics that 
interfere with trade, such as devaluation or other manipulation of the 
value of their money, confiscation (or nationalization) of U.S. property, 
refusing to live up to the contracts and agreements they sign, stealing our 
patents and copyrights, and counterfeiting our money? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Chinese government is engaging in massive piracy of American patented, 
copyrighted and trademarked materials. The U.S. intellectual property 
stolen by the Chinese includes a wide array of products including computer 
programs, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, musical recordings, 
videos, and automotive designs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Collectively, these products are one of the greatest strengths of the U.S. 
economy and are the envy of the world. The United States exports many 
billions of dollars worth of these products each year. China simply finds 
it easier to illegally copy these products than to buy them from us or 
build competitive products, so China steals them on a gigantic scale. Some 
30 Chinese factories daily turn out thousands of illegal compact discs and 
sell them all over the world, and illegally copied recordings, films and 
computer programs are widely available all over China. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Experts estimate that China's piracy in intellectual property amounts to $1 
billion per year in lost U.S. exports. According to the Commerce 
Departmentþs rule-of-thumb, this means that 20,000 American jobs have been 
displaced by the $1 billion in lost U.S. exports. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Just a year ago, U.S. and Chinese negotiators signed a second agreement to 
end this piracy of intellectual property, but these agreements have had no 
effect on the Chinese. China has failed to comply with every major trade 
agreement it has signed with the United States in recent years. The United 
States has threatened China with trade sanctions a half-dozen times, but 
such threats have no effect on China's stealing. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
McDonnell Douglas's dealings with the Communist Chinese offer a good 
example of how they deceive American businessmen in order to steal U.S. 
technology and equipment. By dangling the prospect of a large order for 
passenger planes which was later largely cancelled, the Chinese acquired at 
bargain-basement prices a tremendous quantity of U.S. equipment that is 
building up Chinese military power to threaten other countries. China is 
even sharing our technology with Iran. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The General Accounting Office told Congress on February 27 that Middle East 
counterfeiters are flooding overseas markets with "the highest quality of 
counterfeit $100 U.S. bills Treasury officials have ever seen." Our 
government is sure that a foreign government supports the printers. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This situation is not new. The House Republican Research Committee's Task 
Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare declared four years ago that 
billions of "superdollars" are being produced on "high-tech, state-owned 
presses with paper only acquired by governments." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
On March 2, U.S. negotiator Ira Shapiro said that Japan has failed to carry 
out an agreement it signed in October 1994 to open up its insurance market 
to us. Shapiro said that other areas where Japan remains unwilling to open 
its markets are semiconductors, photographic film, and civil aviation. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Foreign countries impose all kinds of tariffs as well as an endless variety 
of tariff- alternatives, such as limiting the number and kinds of U.S. 
products that may enter their country and forcing U.S. products to meet 
unreasonable requirements. Just ask any of the many companies that have 
tried to sell their products in Japan and have run into one bureaucratic or 
regulatory roadblock after another. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Many foreign countries have governments that are totally corrupt. 
Corruption and bribery are accepted ways of doing business in many foreign 
countries. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Far from being the "free trade" that the NAFTA and GATT treaties promised, 
they have subjected the American economy to new international 
bureaucracies. After Sprint closed a telemarketing plant in San Francisco 
because it was losing money, it not only faced a challenge from the union, 
but on February 27 was subjected to a NAFTA challenge from tri-national 
representatives of Mexico, Canada and the United States. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It is dishonest to eliminate U.S. tariffs and call it "free trade" when any 
or all of the above tactics are used against us. We are fools to seek "free 
trade" with countries that engage in organized theft of our property and 
counterfeiting of our money, or which renege on their agreements and 
contracts. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When the Clinton Administration calls NAFTA and GATT "free trade," we 
should remember that those were the same people who called taxes 
"contributions," and who called government social spending "investments." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But aren't low-tariffs or no-tariffs a good thing? That depends -- on the 
industry, on the source country, on the timing, on the reciprocity. Tariffs 
should be individually determined, and all tariff-alternatives and other 
government restrictions used by other countries should be on the table 
during the negotiations. The guiding principle should be the overall best 
interests of the American people -- not the rulings of foreign bureaucrats.

<h2>
Reading, Writing, 'Rithmetic, and Ritalin
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
Can it be a disease if no X-ray, CT scan, blood test, laboratory 
analysis, MRI, or any other medical test can confirm its existence?  
Can it be a disease if diagnosis can be made by anon-physician 
checking any 8 of 14 items on a behavior checklist such as 
inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity, or short attention span?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet, an estimated two million children (three times as many boys as 
girls) have been labeled with this disease and are taking a powerful 
drug to treat it.  That's four times as many as in 1990.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The disease is Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) or Attention Deficit 
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and the most widely used drug to treat 
it is methylphenidate, known as Ritalin.  A powerful stimulant, it 
juices up the central nervous system, takes effect in 30 minutes, and 
peters out in three to four hours.  Ritalin is classified as a 
Schedule II controlled substance in the same category as cocaine, 
methadone and methamphetamine.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It may be coincidence, but in 1991 the U.S. Department of Education 
formally recognized ADHD as a handicap under the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act and Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation 
Act.  After the Department directed all state education officers to 
ensure that local school districts establish procedures to screen and 
identify ADHD children and give them special educational and 
psychological services, generous funding suddenly began to flow.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Public schools have learned how to tap into free-flowing federal funds 
from Medicaid.  Letters sent home to parents brag that the schools 
"will use this new revenue to add more services for children who 
require specialized health care, social services, mental health care, 
speech therapy, counseling, and psychological services."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Capital Research Center has exposed how Goals 2000 is used as a 
cover to authorize programs in health care and create a system in 
which children selected by teachers are regularly tested for 
emotional, social, mental, and physical disorders (such as ADD and 
ADHD) in clinics inside the public schools.  Once children are 
diagnosed and labeled with one of these conditions, school health 
officials have the authority to treat them by prescribing and 
administering such medications as Ritalin, Valium, Lorazepam and 
Prozac.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Schools are starting to administer medical treatment to children under 
new, looser prescription-writing standards developed under Robert Wood 
Johnson Foundation initiatives.  These new rules allow nurse 
practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe drugs.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Goals 2000 proposals receive funding from the Department of Education, 
Medicaid, Maternal and Child Health (Title X) blockgrants, state 
programs, and private foundations.  Private foundations and government 
agencies have teamed up to develop, coordinate and support a variety 
of public school systems to govern the health and behavior of 
children, sometimes under the name Children's Initiative.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A Pittsburgh-based foundation that will not allow its name to be 
disclosed provided grants for two projects named "Pharmacological and 
Psychosocial Treatment of ADHD" and "Community-Based Treatment for 
ADHD: Summer Treatment Programs and School-Wide Interventions" to be 
operated by the University of Pittsburgh and the Gateway School 
District in Pennsylvania.  The grant funds were matched by taxpayers' 
money from the federal National Institutes of Mental Health.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One portion of this project, called the "Pittsburgh School Wide 
Intervention Model," uses a procedure called sociometrics, in which 
children are asked to answer a lot of nosy questions about the other 
kids in their class, such as who they do not want to befriends with.  
The children are instructed not to discuss the questions and answers 
with anyone else.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1994, the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education 
Programs, under contract HS 92017001, gave the Chesapeake Institute of 
Washington, D.C. the funding to produce two slick videos:  "Facing the 
Challenges of ADD" featuring actress Rita Moreno, and "One Child in 
Every Classroom" with Frank Sesno as moderator.  Parts of the videos 
sound like an infomercial for Ritalin.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In a PBS documentary following eight months of investigation, a 
Department of Education spokesman was asked if he was aware that the 
parents who spoke so enthusiastically about Ritalin on the videos were 
board members of Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder 
(CHADD), and if he knew that CHADD has received cash grants of 
$900,000 plus in-kind services from Ciba-Geigy, the manufacturer of 
Ritalin.  Obviously embarrassed, the bureaucrat denied such knowledge.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's clear that the Department of Education does not adhere to 
professional standards of disclosure.  When anything is published in 
the Journal of the American Medical Association, for example, the 
author must sign a statement in which he reveals "any affiliations 
with or financial involvement in any organization or entity with a 
direct financial interest in the subject matter or materials discussed 
in the manuscript."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
John Merrow, executive producer of the PBS documentary, reported that 
Ritalin is so plentiful that a black market has developed on the 
school playground.  Ritalin can be crushed and snorted for a cheap and 
modest buzz, and it has become a "gateway drug" in junior high school, 
the first drug a child experiments with.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Parents of a child who is diagnosed, labeled, or treated by school-
paid personnel would be well-advised to seek an independent, unbiased 
medical opinion.

<h2>
The Dumbing Down Of America's Colleges 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">
Phyllis Schlafly
</a>
<P>
The 1996 Governors Education Summit at Palisades, New York, spent 
two days discussing &quot;standards&quot; for what students should learn in 
public schools.  Longtime American Federation of Teachers 
president Al Shanker gave this concept a reality check. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
He said, when as a teacher he assigned homework to his class, the 
pupils invariably responded in chorus, &quot;Does it count on our 
grade?&quot;  He pointed out that standards aren't going to make any 
difference if, no matter what students learn or don't learn, they 
can still get admitted to nearly all U.S. colleges and 
universities. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
The National Association of Scholars (NAS), the nation's leading 
higher-education reform organization, has just published a 
devastating 65-page report on the dumbing down of the 50 top 
undergraduate colleges and universities.  The NAS used U.S. 
News & World Report's annual listing of &quot;America's Best 
Colleges&quot; (including both private and public) and compared the 
years 1914, 1939, 1964, and 1993. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
The NAS concludes that students no longer learn the common core 
of knowledge once taken for granted as essential to a liberal- 
arts education.  The universities have simply purged from the 
curriculum many of the required courses that formerly taught 
students the historical, cultural, political and scientific 
basics of our society. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The number of mandatory courses has been dramatically reduced 
from an average of 9.9 in 1914, to 7.3 in 1939, to 6.9 in 1964, 
and to 2.5 in 1993.  The formerly universal requirement that 
students take a basic survey course in several important areas 
has virtually vanished. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Universities now offer very few courses that require 
prerequisites, which means that very few college courses now 
require any advance knowledge or preparation.  In 1914, 
universities offered an average of only 23 courses per 
institution that did not require a prerequisite course; in 1964 
the figure had risen to 127; today, the number is 582. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Only 12 percent of universities now require a thesis or 
comprehensive examination to get a bachelor's degree.  As late as 
1964, more than half of universities did. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The college year has been shortened by about one-fourth (leaving 
more time for spring break and other frivolities, but, of course, 
without any reduction in tuition price or professors' salaries).  
In 1914, college classes were in session an average of 204 days a 
year; by 1939 the number had dropped to 195; in 1964, to 191; and 
today students and teachers are expected to show up in class only 
156 days per academic year. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Maybe the reason why young people can't write good English is 
that so few colleges teach writing any more.  In 1914, nearly all 
universities had required courses in English composition; by 1964 
the figure was 86 percent; today, it's only 36 percent. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ditto for math.  In 1914, 82 percent of the universities had 
traditional mathematics requirements; by 1964 only 36 percent 
did; now, only 12 percent do.  In 1914, 1939 and 1964, more than 
70 percent of the institutions required at least one course in 
the natural sciences; that figure has now fallen to only 34 
percent. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Maybe the reason why the taxpayer-financed federal guidelines on 
the teaching of American history turned out to be such a travesty 
was that most college graduates haven't studied any history.  In 
1914, 90 percent of our elite colleges required history; in 1939 
and 1964 more than 50 percent did; but now only one of the 50 
schools has a required history course. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Literature courses were required at 75 percent of the 
institutions in 1914, and at 50 percent in 1939 and 1964.  Today, 
not one of the &quotbest&quot; institutions has a literature requirement. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, the total number of courses offered at undergraduate 
institutions has increased by a factor of five since 1914, and 
has doubled since 1964, but that doesn't offer more opportunities 
to become an educated citizen.  The majority of these additional 
courses are on narrow and idiosyncratic subjects of interest to 
the professors but almost worthless to the students. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many courses are not college courses at all; they are designed to 
teach students what they didn't learn in high school.  Sometimes 
these courses are called &quot;remedial,&quot; but the institutions prefer 
euphemisms such as &quot;second tier&quot; and &quot;sub-freshman.&quot;
Unheard of prior to 1939, today such non-college courses are offered in 70 
percent of the elite universities, and most of them award college 
credit. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
California state legislators have recently discovered the high 
cost to the taxpayers of the remedial education courses given at 
the state universities.  Last year, 60 percent of new students 
needed remedial help. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
California legislators assert that students have been the victims 
of consumer fraud perpetrated on them by the high schools that 
gave them high grades.  The legislators want to send the invoice 
for the cost of the remedial courses to the high schools that 
deceived their students by giving them a 3.8 or higher grade- 
point average. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The NAS concludes that our best colleges and universities no 
longer turn out graduates who have even an elementary knowledge 
of our civilization and its heritage.  They do not learn the 
basic facts of our country's history, political and economic 
systems, philosophic traditions, and literary and artistic 
legacies, and the result is that we are in danger of losing the 
national cohesion of a known and shared American heritage.

<h2>
MSAs Are The Republicans' Best Issue
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
schlafly
.html">
Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
What are Republicans going to do about the top election-year issue, 
which is jobs, wages and income?  Real (inflation-adjusted) weekly 
wages have dropped almost 5 percent since 1979.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Business spokesmen are trying to downplay this data by arguing that 
employee fringe benefits have risen from 17 percent of total 
compensation in 1955 to 40 percent in 1994.  Total compensation equals 
take-home pay plus fringe benefits, of which health care is a large 
component.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Workers aren't buying this argument because, while the employer's cost 
to provide the health-care benefit has risen, the value of the health 
care benefit to the employee has declined.  Whereas in 1979, the 
employee's health-care package allowed him to go to any doctor or 
hospital of his choice, now employees are being herded into HMOs where 
they are at the mercy of gatekeepers.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
HMOs suffer from a built-in conflict of interest; the gatekeepers and 
the CEOs make more money if they deny your right to see a specialist.  
That's why opposition to the tactics of the HMOs,and to the windfall 
profits these tactics produce for CEOs and stockholders, is bubbling 
over, and an anti-managed care march is planned for Washington in May.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congressional Republicans have a good answer to these problems, if 
they will only use it.  It could put extra money in the pockets of 
workers whose real wages have declined, and it could ease the strain 
of downsizing by allowing them to take some of their benefits with 
them when they leave the company.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This solution is Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs), which most House 
Republicans campaigned on in 1994.  The Congress passed Rep. Bill 
Archer's excellent MSA bill in the Balanced Budget Act, which Clinton 
vetoed; and then the House passed it again in its health care reform 
bill, now pending.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But President Clinton and the Washington press corps are trying to 
bamboozle the Dole-Gingrich Congress into passing the Kennedy-
Kassebaum bill without MSAs, which would take us a long way into the 
Clintoncare system we thought we had buried in 1994.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Medical Savings Accounts are the best solution to all the problems 
connected with health care:  the high cost, preserving your right to 
choose your own doctor, portability, pre-existing conditions, job 
lock, uninsured Americans, gatekeepers, capitation, deductibles, co-
payments, paperwork, long-term care, Medicare going bankrupt, and even 
the decline in real wages. Here is how MSAs would work.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For those who are in a company plan, the employer would buy you a 
high-deductible policy and pre-pay your deductible (up to $2,000 per 
year for singles and $4,000 for families) by putting it each year into 
your individual Medical Savings Account.  You can use this ready cash 
for your medical costs with the doctors, hospitals and clinics you 
choose, and the high-deductible policy covers you for additional 
expenses.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You would own your own MSA (just as you now own your automobile 
insurance).  That means you can take it with you when you change jobs, 
thus solving the problems of portability, pre-existing conditions, and 
job lock.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What if you are self-employed, a part-timer, or are not in an 
employer-paid health plan?  In those cases, you can set up your MSA 
and your high-deductible policy with your own money.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Archer bill would give MSAs pretty much the same tax-deductibility 
that is now enjoyed exclusively by company-paid plans.  Our present 
system is unjust, unfair and intolerable because it grants tax-
deductibility only to plans owned by employers, but not to plans that 
allow individual employees to own their own health insurance, control 
their own health care spending, or set up their own plan.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That is probably the most discriminatory feature of the entire federal 
legal system.  The officers of big corporations enjoy gold-plated 
health insurance paid for with tax-deductible dollars, but the 
waitress, the part-timers and the self-employed can buy health 
insurance only with after-tax dollars (which means it costs double).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The sweetest part of MSAs is that whatever you don't spend will stay 
in your MSA and build up as a tax-free, interest-bearing savings 
account (only 11 percent of all insured individual Americans spend 
more than $2,000 a year on health care).  That will bring down health 
care costs dramatically because MSAs will put consumer discipline into 
the marketplace and provide incentives to save.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Your MSA will grow as you or your employer puts in a new payment every 
year.  MSAs will be available now and in the future for many medical 
expenses often not covered by company plans (such as eye glasses, 
dental care, or preventive care) or by Medicare (prescriptions and 
long-term care).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress should reject the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, ignore the HMO 
lobbyists, and instead give workers the MSAs that the Republican 
majority in Congress promised.

<title>Schlafly: The Tide Is Turning Against Federal Education Bills -- 4/25/96</title>

<h2>
The Tide Is Turning Against Federal Education Bills 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
schlafly

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
 
 
We've heard a lot about Republican plans to return power to the states. 
Bob Dole, in his stump speech, ostentatiously pulls a copy of the Tenth 
Amendment from his pocket, reminding us about the powers that are 
"reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nothing in the Tenth Amendment, however, authorizes the devolution of 
power to the Governors of the various states. Yet, under the bipartisan 
education bills now moving through Congress, the Federal Government 
would collect taxes, issue new federal regulations about the public 
schools (an area that should be "reserved to the states"), and then 
give the money and the power to the Governors, bypassing state 
legislatures altogether.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This massive legislation, which seeks to restructure public schools 
throughout all 50 states, builds on the Goals 2000 Act and the School-
to-Work Act, both passed in 1994 and signed by President Clinton. 
H.R.1617 (known as the CAREERS bill) passed the House last September by 
a vote of 345 to 79, and its companion S.143 (the Workforce Development 
Act) passed the Senate in October by 95 to 2.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One might think that such large majorities would mean that the bills 
are not controversial. Actually they've stirred up a hornet's nest.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Speaker Gingrich has just received a letter signed by 63 Republican 
members of the Missouri House objecting to the fact that H.R.1617 
"centralizes unprecedented powers at the federal level" and "supersedes 
state laws and further takes us, the local elected officials of the 
people of this state, out of the process of education." These 
legislators specifically object to the way that the CAREERS act "amends 
out the state legislature, replacing it with the Governor."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since Missouri has a liberal Democratic Governor, Mel Carnahan, it's 
easy to see why Republican legislators think this is a very bad idea. A 
similar letter was signed by 13 Republican Missouri State Senators.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The letter from the 63 Missouri State Representatives asserts that 
"this practice of avoiding the Legislature is unacceptable and flies in 
the face of the principle of local control of education."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Missouri letter also describes the devious additional ways that 
real power over school curriculum is being gathered into the hands of 
unelected bureaucrats, bypassing all elected officials such as state 
legislators and school boards. This is accomplished through the grant 
application which each Governor must submit in order to access federal 
money under the 1994 laws, as well as under the new legislation.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These grant applications bind the states to conform to "standards" and 
"assessments" that are written by unelected federal or state 
bureaucrats and over which no elected representative or parent had any 
authority. In addition, the grant applications bind the states to spend 
money that the legislature had not appropriated.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Republican Congressmen who voted for H.R.1617 have made a strenuous 
effort to allay the fears of their constituents by asserting that these 
are "Republican" bills. That's not true.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The fact is that the Senate bill was largely written by a Senator Ted 
Kennedy staffer, the late Steve Spinner, who worked on it for three 
years. On the floor of the U.S. Senate, both Kennedy and Senator Nancy 
Kassebaum paid tribute to Spinner as the principal author of the bill 
and of the whole concept of using the public schools to carry out "work 
force education and employment functions" and turn schools into "a 
comprehensive one-stop delivery system."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The micromanaging of public school curricula that will be exercised by 
the federal bureaucrats is evident from a letter in which the U.S. 
Departments of Labor and Education rejected the State of California's 
grant application for funds from the School to Work Law. The letter 
charged that California showed "a lack of systemic methods within the 
State to integrate vocational and academic curricula" and that 
California had failed to develop "Certificates for Foundations Skills 
and Career Entry."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A letter signed by 14 California State Senators called on Congress to 
"kill" H.R.1617. Among the many reasons cited were the awesome 
provision that would strike "a State" from certain federal laws and 
substitute "the Governor of the State," the extraordinary powers given 
to all Governors, and the setting up of a "National Electronic Data 
Base."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL), who voted for the CAREERS bill last year, has 
changed his mind and recently circulated a "Dear Colleague" letter 
urging the repeal of Goals 2000 and the School to Work Act, as well as 
the defeat of H.R.1617 and S.143. He pointed out that they are all 
designed to implement the plan laid out in an 18-page letter written by 
Marc Tucker to Hillary Clinton on November 11, 1992, to make 
schoolchildren "guinea pigs who will become the human resources for the 
global labor market."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is clear from the writings of Marc Tucker, Ira Magaziner, Hillary 
Clinton, Robert Reich, and the legislative history of H.R.1617 and 
S.143 that the goal is to transform public school curricula into 
specific workforce tracks determined by local workforce development 
boards. The proper name for this is National Economic Planning, a.k.a. 
Socialism, a system that has failed all over the world.

<title>THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION SHOULD BE ABOLISHED</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<center><i>July 7, 1995</i>
<hr>
<center></h2><b>The Legal Services Corporation Should be Abolished</b></h2></center>



By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html"> Phyllis Schlafly</a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p>
The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is the acid test to
demonstrate whether or not the new Republican majority really
intends to reform and reduce Big Government.  If the Republicans
merely play around with smoke and mirrors, pretending to correct
abuses, but leave the money faucet turned on, they will have
betrayed their mandate from the 1994 election and left their
enemies with a gun pointed at their head.
<p>
Budget leader Rep. John Kasich (R-OH) has scheduled LSC for
termination, except for some shut-down expenses.  Sen. Phil
Gramm (R-TX) is trying to get the Senate to agree. 
Unfortunately, Rep. Bill McCollum (R-FL) is working with the
Democrats to reauthorize (i.e., to save) LSC under the euphemism
of "reform."
<p>
The ideological incompatibility of the LSC with the new
Republican regime is indicated by the fact that Hillary Rodham
Clinton used to be its chairman of the board.  LSC has continued
to be peopled with leftist activists who share her class-warfare
ideology and socialist goals.  The record of LSC shows that it
functions not to provide services to the needy, but to serve as
a pot of gold for leftwing activists to litigate and lobby for
radical causes.
<p>
LSC has spent $5 billion since 1974.  If the leftwing lawyers
had merely torched the money, that wouldn't have been nearly as
destructive as spending the money the way they did.
<p>
In fact, they spent the money to litigate and lobby to increase
entitlements (for welfare, aliens, criminals, etc.) that are the
chief cause of federal deficits.  Howard Phillips, who has been
monitoring LSC since 1970 when President Nixon appointed him to
a position that included that responsibility, asserts that LSC
activism has added $2 trillion to the national debt.
<p>
The LSC lawyers have constructed for themselves such a
Byzantine, self-perpetuating infrastructure and grant-making
mechanism that they are accountable to no one:  not to Congress,
or to the Administration, or to the people they serve, or to the
taxpayers who foot the bills.
<p>
When most people think of legal aid services for the poor, they
think of helping victims, especially women and children. 
Instead, LSC works for such causes as preventing the eviction of
drug dealers from public housing, shielding violent offenders'
criminal records from the public, getting perks for prison
inmates, and releasing mental patients (who often then join the
ranks of the homeless).
<p>
When LSC lawyers talk about conducting "research" and
facilitating "training," they are using euphemisms for political
organizing and lobbying for pro-abortion, pro-gay rights,
pro-welfare entitlement, pro-criminal, pro-drug, and pro-illegal
alien causes.
<p>
LSC's litigation deserves a large share of the blame for the
out-of-control, failed welfare crisis we have today.  LSC
initiated the case, King v. Smith, in which the
Supreme Court ruled in 1968 that the behavior of welfare
mothers, including cohabiting with wage-earning males, could not
be considered when determining eligibility for benefits.
<p>
In Shapiro v. Thompson in 1969, LSC got the Supreme Court to ban
the one-year residency requirement for welfare eligibility.  In
1970, in Goldberg v. Kelly, LSC persuaded the
Supreme Court to require a hearing process before benefits can
be cut off for any reason.  As a result, hardly anyone is ever
cut off.
<p>
The theory behind these cases, invented by LSC tax-funded
lawyers, is that welfare recipients have a property right in
their benefits, just like the rest of us have a property right
in our houses or automobiles.  This off-the-wall rationale has
become the cornerstone of the welfare rights movement, which has
changed our laws and picked the pockets of taxpayers.
<p>
Another favorite LSC constituency is incarcerated convicted
felons.  LSC's class action suit against the North Carolina
prison system resulted in a requirement that each of 13 prisons
provide softball and basketball equipment for two teams, a
piano, a set of drums, three guitars, and five frisbees. 
Another LSC victory was to establish Chicago prisoners' rights
to cable television and expensive weight rooms.
<p>
Other exotic LSC lawsuits included representing transsexuals in
an effort to overturn Georgia's prohibition on Medicaid
reimbursement for sex change operations, forcing public housing
officials to rent apartments to unemancipated minors, and trying
to define opium and alcohol addiction as a disability under the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
<p>
LSC's current president, Alexander Forger (best known as
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's lawyer), was questioned in April by
a Congressional committee about the imposition of certain
limitations on the way LSC funds are spent.  He impudently
replied:  "There is a legal case, if we choose to assert it,
that the [House] Committee does not have the authority to make
that decision."
<p>
Radical leftwing activism is part and parcel of LSC.  It is a
fraud on the public to pretend it can be reformed.  It must be
abolished.

<center><h2>Education Reform, Ted Kennedy-Style</center></h2>
<p>

<center>By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html"> Phyllis Schlafly</a> 
</center><hr><p>
<p>
Here's a multiple-choice question for you.  Will the new
conservative Republican majority in Congress 
<p>
(a) terminate federal functions for which there is no
constitutional authority, e.g., education; 
<p>
(b) reduce the size of government by abolishing agencies, e.g., the
Department of Education; 
<p>
(c) reduce the power of the Federal Government to micro-manage our
lives, e.g., stop mandating school curriculum; or 
<p>
(d) adopt a Ted Kennedy blueprint to manage individual behavior
from the schoolroom to the workplace?   
<p>
If you picked (d), you are on to the plan of the "moderate" House
Republicans to use the current momentum for education reform to put
America into the harness of National Economic Planning, a.k.a.
socialism.  Their plan is to use the school system to prepare
children, individually and collectively, only for jobs that are
designated and determined by the planners. 
<p>
One bill, sponsored by two senior Republicans, Steve Gunderson (R-
WI) and Bill Goodling (R-PA), is called "A Proposal for the
Establishment of the Department of Education and Employment." 
Riding the tide of the movement to abolish the Department of
Education, their bill would simply consolidate it with the
Department of Labor and put Robert Reich in charge.
<p>
This bill would convert public schools into "Workforce Preparation"
centers "to meet the challenges of a competitive global economy in
the 21st century."  Schoolchildren would be trained, rather than
educated, and schools would become "efficient delivery systems" to
serve the global economy.
<p>
A variation of this same goal, called the "Consolidated and
Reformed Education, Employment, and Rehabilitation Systems Act"
(H.R. 1617), known by its acronym CAREERS, was introduced on May 11
and speedily passed out of committee on June 22.  Sponsored by Rep.
Howard McKeon (R-CA), it is actually modeled on a bill introduced
earlier this year by Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA) called the
"Workforce Development Act" (S. 180).
<p>
H.R. 1617 was designed to deceive conservatives by repealing last
year's "Schools-to-Work" Act and some other cumbersome and
redundant jobs and education programs.  However, H.R. 1617's 233
pages contain much more dangerous replacements.
<p>
Three key provisions in the Republican CAREERS bill parallel the
key provisions of Kennedy's "Workforce" bill.
<p>
The first key provision is that both bills give government the
responsibility for job placement and development through a
"Workforce Development Plan."  Kennedy's "Workforce" bill would
implement this through federal, state and local boards.  McKeon's
CAREERS bill specifies that the Governor shall submit "a strategic
state workforce development and literacy plan to provide policy
guidance with respect to workforce development progress" that meets
the requirements of the U.S. Secretaries of Education and Labor.
<p>
The second key provision of both "Workforce" and CAREERS is a labor
market information system (LMIS).  "Workforce" calls for a
"comprehensive, integrated labor market [information] system to
assure that workforce development programs are related to the
demand for particular skills in a local labor market."  CAREERS
would amend the 1933 Wagner Act to enumerate the information that
will be collected, managed and shared between the private and
public sectors.
<p>
CAREERS sets up a "comprehensive and coordinated labor market
information system" that will "project employment opportunities and
trends" based on "profiles of employers" and the "education and
training of job seekers."  The data collection system will record
how well the schoolchild did on the "performance assessments" of
the state's "goals and objectives" that are part of "Goals 2000,"
and be so thorough that even the "level of satisfaction of the
participants" will be measured and recorded.
<p>
The premise of the LMIS is the assumption that government
committees know what is best for the individual and for the
economy.  This is the structure under which the Soviets managed
their planned economy for so many decades, with Five-Year and Ten-
Year Plans that always failed.
<p>
Government economic planning is an abysmal failure worldwide, and
it's hard to think of anything that would be a bigger detriment to
future economic growth.  Can you imagine, for example, that any
government planning board would have decided in the 1980s that
workers needed to be trained for the immense computer and
communications industry that has arisen since then?
<p>
The third key provision in both Kennedy's "Workforce" bill and
McKeon's CAREERS bill is "one-stop career centers" (probably
located at public schools).  This is where the individual comes in
contact with the national economic planning system.
<p>
Based on economic projections by the different tiers of boards and
the vast collection of data on individuals, the "one-stop career
center" will train individuals for designated job slots.
<p>
The bottom line of these bills is to give the Federal Government
the power over every individual's ability to earn a living.  If we
let the government decide what jobs are "needed," what jobs young
people may be trained for, what performance and "outcome" standards
may be enforced on schoolchildren, and what certificate qualifies
them to be hired, and then track each individual's performance and
behavior in school and through the workforce on a national computer
data base, we will have lost freedom in America.

<title>Anniversary of the LifeSaver Bomb</title>

<center><h2>Anniversary of the LifeSaver Bomb</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
By Phyllis Schlafly August 10, 1995
<p>
<p>
Ever since the Smithsonian Institution earlier this year tried to
give us all a guilty conscience about the B-29 named Enola Gay,
we've been inundated with a torrent of breastbeating about the
dropping of the atom bomb on Hiroshima.  The 50th anniversary of
August 6, 1945 is supposed to make us all hang our heads in shame.
<p>
Newsweek accompanied pages of ugly pictures with a poll reporting
that Americans now think dropping the bomb on Japan was "wrong." 
But the poll demographics tell a different story.  The senior
citizens whose lives were on the line in World War II approve of
the bombing, while the younger generations that don't remember
World War II have the luxury of sanctimonious second-guessing.
<p>
For the men who fought World War II, the atom bomb was a lifesaver
in every meaning of the word.  Dropping the bomb on Hiroshima meant
the difference between life and death to hundreds of thousands of
our best and brightest young men.
<p>
Dropping the atom bomb on Hiroshima meant that those fine young
American men could come home, grow up to live normal lives, marry
and raise families, instead of dying a tortured death 5,000 miles
away.  The lucky ones would have identifiable graves.
<p>
What the Hiroshima bomb accomplished was to preempt General George
Marshall's horrendous plan to defeat Japan:  an island-by-island
invasion at a projected cost of a half million American deaths.
<p>
The first phase, called Operation Olympic, would have sent 650,000
American servicemen starting November 1, 1945 to try to capture the
island of Kyushu.  It would have been a slaughter because the
Japanese were prepared to defend Kyushu with 540,000 troops and
5,000 kamikaze planes.
<p>
The follow-up invasion, called Operation Coronet, was scheduled to
start the drive toward Tokyo on March 1, 1946.  U.S. plans
projected an invasion force of two million men.
<p>
Marshall couldn't have had any illusions about the hideous human
cost of such an island-by-island invasion.  Iwo Jima had given us
a preview.
<p>
On February 19, 1945, 30,000 Marines landed on that little five-
mile island, and five days later planted the U.S. flag, an event
immortalized in the most famous war photograph in history.  When
the Iwo Jima battle ended a month later, the price we had paid for
raising our flag was 26,000 casualties including more than 6,800
dead (including three of the six men in the photograph).
<p>
Japanese soldiers were tough fighters.  Under orders not to be
captured alive, only 1,000 were taken prisoner while 22,000 died
defending Iwo Jima.
<p>
With those kinds of casualty figures, only a reckless disregard of
American lives could cause a U.S. leader to send American troops to
invade Japanese home islands.  But that was the Marshall plan, even
though he knew from the coded messages we had intercepted that
Japan planned to defend its home islands with 2.3 million troops,
another four million Army and Navy employees, and an armed militia
of 28 million, all sworn to fight to the death.
<p>
Admiral William D. Leahy, Truman's military adviser, predicted that
30 to 35 percent of U.S. soldiers would be killed or wounded during
the first 30 days of an invasion of Japan.  The Hiroshima bomb
saved those lives, as well as those of about 400,000 Allied
prisoners of war and civilian detainees held by the Japanese, whom
Japan had planned to execute in the event of an American invasion. 
<p>
President Harry (the buck stops here) Truman didn't have any
difficulty making the atom bomb decision, and he shouldn't have. 
He told reporters in 1947 that "I didn't have any doubts at the
time" because the decision saved 250,000 to 500,000 American lives.
<p>
"I'd do it again," Truman said in 1956.  In 1962, he added, "I knew
I'd done the right thing."
<p>
Nor did other Americans at the time have any qualms about the loss
of life in the country that had started the war with a sneak attack
on Pearl Harbor.  Newsweek, for example, cheered the fact that
"perhaps one million persons were made homeless" by our firebombing
of Tokyo.
<p>
The argument is made today that we should not have dropped the bomb
because "Japan was already seeking to surrender."  In an interview
with veteran journalist Philip Clarke in 1962, Truman answered,
"The bombs were dropped after Japan had been warned that we had
discovered the greatest explosive in the history of the world and
then we asked them to surrender.  They did not do it."
<p>
Japan didn't even surrender after the Hiroshima bomb was dropped. 
It took the second atom bomb at Nagasaki, three days later, to
induce Japan to surrender.
<p>
Instead of being haunted by the ghosts of Hiroshima, Americans
today should remember the American heroes of Iwo Jima, Guadalcanal,
Midway, and Okinawa, and rejoice that the survivors of those bloody
battles lived to come home to America instead of being killed on
the beaches of Japan.

<title>LET'S ABOLISH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<center><h2>Let's Abolish The Department of Education</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
By Phyllis Schlafly  August 17, 1995
<p>
<p>
Abolishing the Department of Education was one of Ronald Reagan's
campaign promises when he ran for President in 1980.  Fulfilling
that promise is long overdue, and the time to do it is now.
<p>
Education is not a department that has always been with us like
State, Treasury, and Justice.  The Department of Education was
created as a payoff to the National Education Association (NEA) for
its early endorsement of Jimmy Carter's presidential candidacy in
1976.
<p>
That NEA endorsement was a significant factor in giving Carter
national visibility and momentum.  At that time, the little-known
one-term Governor of a southern state was considered a long shot by
most observers.
<p>
The NEA has the same symbiotic relationship with Bill Clinton.  On
his way to the 1992 Democratic National Convention that nominated
him, he stopped off for a visit with Keith Geiger, then NEA
president, and promised to invite him to sleep in Abe Lincoln's bed
at the White House. 
<p>
Contrary to the gloom-and-doom fearmongering of the education
lobby, U.S. public schools will not collapse if the Department of
Education is abolished.  Public schools flourished before there was
any Department of Education (and academic standards were much
higher), and public schools will continue to exist if the
Department is abolished.
<p>
Federal spending in public schools amounts to only about six
percent of their total budget.  Every week we read about
corporations successfully downsizing their workforce and thereby
achieving greater efficiency, so public schools should have no
difficulty downsizing by six percent.  Their top-heavy and
redundant administrative bureaucracy is a scandal, anyway.
<p>
Congress doles out 70 billion federal tax dollars per year on what
is euphemistically called education.  The mere listing of the
programs is awesome and depressing.
<p>
The Department of Education spends $33 billion a year of this
amount administering 244 different programs.  The remainder of the
$70 billion is spent by 30 other federal agencies on 308 programs,
which the General Accounting Office says "often are duplicative and
overlapping."
<p>
More than 90 federal preschool and child care programs are
administered through eleven federal agencies and 20 offices that
target children of similar ages and provide similar services. 
There are 86 federal programs in nine federal departments that
offer teacher training.
<p>
At least 46 federal programs administered by eight federal agencies
are working on what is called youth development.  Fourteen
different programs provide food and food-related assistance.  At
least 163 federal programs, spread out among 15 departments and
agencies, say they are providing employment and training
assistance.
<p>
This federal spending imposes a costly paperwork burden on local
schools.  A 1991 survey of Ohio school districts reported that
schools must complete 173 federal reports and forms.  
<p>
We should face the fact that, like welfare, our 30 year experiment
in federal spending on education has failed.  Illiteracy has
reached epidemic levels and Scholastic Aptitude Test scores have
dropped 73 points since 1960.
<p>
Incidentally, the decline in SAT scores is now going to be
concealed from the public starting this year by the simple device
of raising every test score nearly 100 points.  They call this
"centering," but another word for it is cheating.
<p>
The 1994 election sent a strong message to Congress:  cut federal
spending, reduce government, eliminate agencies.  Unfortunately,
some Congressmen seem to think they can pretend to abolish the
Department of Education while merely shifting the functions and the
spending to other agencies.
<p>
It is a bafflement how any Congressman could think that the
constituency eager to abolish the Department of Education could be
appeased by transferring the functions and the spending to Labor
Secretary Robert Reich or Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala.  Yet those are the most discussed proposals for education
"reform." 
<p>
Out across America, the mood of the people is just the opposite.  
Three states this year actually rejected federal funding for Goals
2000, a truly remarkable reaction to the offer of goodies from the
federal treasury.
<p>
The U.S. Constitution doesn't mention education, and there is no
authority in the Constitution for the Federal Government to meddle
in local schools.  Education is not a proper federal function.
<p>
If the Federal Government has no constitutional authority to ban
guns from schools (which the Supreme Court ruled in this year's
Lopez decision), then it follows a fortiori that the Federal
Government has no authority to impose curricular requirements or
hand out funds according to the whims and the politics of federal
officials.
<p>
Public schools in America were vastly superior before the Federal
Government turned on the funding faucet.  It's time to write finis
to federal aid to education and return that $70 billion per year to
the American people in tax cuts.

<h3>WHY ARE REPUBLICANS PROMOTING MANAGED CARE?</h3>
By <a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Republicans spent two years attacking the totalitarian Clinton
Health Plan because it would put all Americans into Managed Care,
allow medical care only as permitted by Gatekeepers, deny our right
to choose our own doctor, limit access to specialists, and force us
to enroll in Regional Alliances with more government control and
price fixing.  Republicans won the argument, defeated all versions
of Clintoncare, and used Clinton's Health Plan as a central issue
in winning a Republican majority in Congress.<p>
Now, it's hard to believe, but the Republican Congressional
leadership has warmed over the same bad ideas and is touting them
as Medicare reform.  If Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole think they can
sell the same bad product that Bill Clinton failed to sell, they
are out of touch with the real world.<p>
Drafts of the Republican Medicare reform that have leaked out 
indicate that it is based on herding seniors into Managed Care
(HMOs).  The Managed Care lobby reputedly has $9 billion (not
million) in cash reserves to soft-sell its propaganda, so it's not
surprising that Republican spokesmen are suddenly praising Managed
Care.<p>
Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) is appearing on television as a spokesman
for the Republican Medicare plan.  Using data provided by the Group
Health Association of America, the HMO trade group, he claims that
people just love HMOs.<p>
The Managed Care lobby has succeeded in making Rep. Bill Thomas (R-
CA), chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on health, their
chief Managed Care advocate in the House.  His statements on
managed care on a PBS special to be aired in September are truly
incredible, according to one reporter who has previewed it.<p>
Thomas was asked to address the complaint of a person who can no
longer choose his doctor because his company switched to an HMO. 
Thomas repled, "I'd ask you a couple of questions.  How did you
find your first doctor?  Well, the answer is that it was probably
a friend of a friend, or you looked in the Yellow Pages."<p>
"And this," he exclaimed, "is the sacred system that someone wants
to defend! Now, you created a personal relationship, which you
don't want to change.  There's no reason in the world why that
personal relationship couldn't be recreated."<p>
Sorry, Bill, seniors are not going to let you "recreate" personal
relationships with their doctors.  Seniors are not dumb and they
vote, so they may decide to "recreate" their relationship with
their Congressman and elect one who will stand up for the right to
choose your own doctor.<p>
Republicans claim that their Medicare plan would offer seniors more
"options" among "plans."  That's an illusion.  The only option that
matters is the option to choose your specialist and your treatment
when you are sick.  HMOs put those choices in the hands of
Gatekeepers who receive increased pay for limiting access.<p>
Republicans made a terrible blunder in letting Medicare become the
number-one issue of the 1995-1996 campaign.  It's a losing issue
for Republicans, and their arguments are not selling at the
grassroots.<p>
The Gephardt line is powerful:  "Republicans are cutting the
benefits and raising taxes on the elderly in order to give tax
breaks to the rich."  As top Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said: 
"Linking Medicare reforms to tax cuts is a potent line of attack. 
Hurting beneficiaries is what matters."<p>
The Republican leadership must change its strategy and make Medical
Savings Accounts for today's workers (i.e., H.R. 1818) the
centerpiece of health care reform.  Go for the votes of the 30-55
year old age group and tell the truth:<p>
"Medicare as we know it is not going to be there when you are
age65.  We Republicans are going to make sure you have health care
by allowing you to set up your personal tax-deductible Medical
Savings Account (MSA) so that you will have your own money to
provide your health care needs.  With MSAs, you can choose your own
doctor, save for health care in retirement and long-term care, and
avoid HMO gatekeepers."<p>
Medicare was the crown jewel of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. 
The underlying premise is that today's workers should be taxed to
pay for the health care of the elderly.  It's a Ponzi scheme that
only works as long as more people are paying into the system than
are receiving benefits.  When the baby boomers reach 65, the Ponzi
scheme will totally collapse, with or without Medicare HMOs.<p>
Liberal Democrats know that MSAs represent a direct challenge to
their generation-transfer scheme.  They hope that Republicans
continue to expend their political capital in politically fatal
Medicare ""reform'' rather than giving baby boomers a personal
medical savings account, which would liberate them from socialized
medicine in retirement.<p>
Medical Savings Accounts are not only smart politics, but they are
the best long-term solution for financing our health care system. <p>

<h2>Is the Government Planning Your Child's Career?</h2> <P>
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center><P>

<hr><P> 
Republican Presidential candidates criss-crossing the country have 
discovered that one of their best hot-button applause lines is "I 
promise to abolish the Department of Education." Out in the byways of 
America, parents know that public schools are a disaster area and that 
Federal Government spending has hurt, not helped, the situation. 
 <p>
So it is a puzzlement why the Republican House just passed an 
education bill that increases federal control and involvement in the 
public schools rather than reducing it. Called the "CAREERS" bill, it 
uses federal dollars to expand and institutionalize one of the worst 
Clinton bills passed last year, the School-to-Work Opportunities Act. 
 <p>
Republican Congressmen who voted for this bill are sending six-page 
handouts to their constituents purporting to show how amendments have 
"answered parents' concerns." But opponents of CAREERS didn't merely 
have "concerns" about the CAREERS bill; they recognize it as the 
philosophy we thought we defeated in the 1994 election. 
 <p>
When one takes time to read the CAREERS bill, it is obvious that it is 
the legislative implementation of an 18-page letter written by Marc 
Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, 
to Hillary Clinton on November 11, 1992, just after the Presidential 
election. This letter states that it was the result of a meeting in 
David Rockefeller's office, at which those present were "literally 
radiating happiness" at Clinton's victory. 
 <p>
They were celebrating their plans for what "you [Hillary] and Bill 
should do now about education, training and labor market policy." 
Tucker's letter laid out their master plan to "remold" the public 
schools into a "national human resources development system," which 
would be "guided by clear standards that define the stages of the 
system for the people who progress through it, and regulated on the 
basis of outcomes that providers produce for their clients." 
 <p>
Tucker's vision is aggressively ambitious. His letter called for "a 
seamless web" that "literally extends from cradle to grave and is the 
same system for everyone -- young and old, poor and rich, worker and 
full-time student." 
 <p>
Tucker's "seamless web" includes a national employment service in 
which "all available front-line jobs, whether public or private, must 
be listed in it by law." Then, "a system of labor market boards is 
established at the local, state and federal levels to coordinate the 
systems for job training, postsecondary professional and technical 
education, adult basic education, job matching and counseling." 
 <p>
Tucker's "seamless web" calls for government to be in the drivers' 
seat at every stage of the "human resources development system." The 
"labor market boards" will decide what jobs may be allowed, and the 
schools will "train" students (the human resources) for jobs selected 
by the "labor market boards." 
 <p>
The "new general education standard" (i.e., a state-certified 
"certificate of mastery" rather than a diploma) will become a 
"prerequisite for enrollment in all professional and technical degree 
programs," as well as for all hiring. Tucker's letter lays out how, 
under his system, schools will be required to provide information "to 
government agencies in a uniform format." 
 <p>
Tucker's letter makes it clear why so much of the discussion about 
Congressional appropriations for education includes references to the 
Department of Labor. Tucker and his friends have been planning to meld 
Labor and Education functions ever since Lynn Martin, Secretary of 
Labor in the Bush Administration, published the SCANS report. 
 <p>
Much of Marc Tucker's ambitious plan is already in place. Last year, 
Clinton signed the Goals 2000 Act, which requires schools to adopt 
"standards," and the School-to-Work law, which lays the groundwork for 
using high schools to train students for occupations selected by the 
local labor market boards. 
 <p>
The CAREERS bill expands on School-to-Work and perfectly tracks the 
Tucker letter. The CAREERS text states that the Governor of each state 
(if he wants the funds) shall "designate" the establishment of "a 
local workforce development board" in each local area. In the House 
debate on CAREERS on September 19, Education Opportunities Committee 
Chairman William Goodling (R-PA) stated that the bill requires that 
"training be tied to occupations in demand in the local community." 
 <p>
CAREERS makes it clear that government will now assume the power to 
set up workforce development plans, with a comprehensive and 
coordinated labor market computer system, and that students will be 
trained only to work in the occupations prescribed by the government. 
<p> 
In the House debate, Goodling boasted that the White House is pleased 
with this legislation. He admitted that the CAREERS bill has been in 
preparation "for 2 years," which places the date at long before 
Republicans became a majority in the House. 
 <p>
When you combine this workforce system with the schools' obvious 
failure to teach children to read and the dumbing down process called 
Outcome-Based Education, the result will be a Third World education to 
accustom Americans to Third World wages. The "powers that be" want 
public school graduates to be content to compete with workers in 
foreign countries who work for 1/40th of American wages. 
<p> 
Think about that every time you hear politicians, businessmen, 
educators and bureaucrats talking on television about "competing in 
the global economy" and becoming "citizens of the world."

<h2>Beware of Global Taxes for Global Entitlements </h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P>
"It's not sustainable for member states to enjoy representation 
without taxation," Prime Minister John Major told the United Nations 
at its birthday celebration. He thought he was demonstrating British 
wit in making a play on the great slogan of the American Revolution. 
We are not amused. 
<p> 
The United Nations has a big problem: the tax-cutting Republican 
Congress is disinclined to continue financing those overpaid foreign 
bureaucrats in the lavish style to which they have become accustomed. 
So their solution is to impose a global tax that would produce 
billions or even trillions of dollars without any Congressional 
action. 
 <p>
The so-called Independent Commission on Population and Quality of Life 
has issued a report listing dozens of innovative global devices to tax 
people, corporations, and international business activities. These 
include taxes on aviation traffic and freight, ocean freight and 
cruises, aviation fuel, telecommunications frequencies, communications 
satellites, international postal items, and trade in goods and 
services. 
 <p>
The global tax idea was first publicly launched at the UN World Summit 
for Social Development, held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in March 1995. 
James G. Speth, the Clinton-appointed head of the UN Development 
Program, called for a global tax on speculative movements of 
international funds, the consumption of non-renewable energy, 
environmental permits, and the arms trade. 
 <p>
James Tobin, 1981 Nobel Prize winner in Economics, has called for a 
tax on spot transactions in foreign exchange. The UN bureaucrats are 
licking their chops at Tobin's prediction that "the revenue potential 
is immense, over $1.5 trillion a year," and they are now 
enthusiastically using Tobin's prestige to advocate what they call the 
"Tobin tax." 
 <p>
The Commission on Global Governance, a "private" group with government 
and foundation funding, published a volume this year entitled "Our 
Global Neighborhood." Stating that "it is time for a consensus on 
global taxation for servicing the needs of the global neighborhood," 
this report calls for taxes on flight-lanes, sea lanes, and ocean 
fishing areas. 
 <p>
This report also brags that "the idea of safeguarding and managing the 
global commons, particularly those related to the physical 
environment, is now widely accepted. And the notion of expanding the 
role of the United Nations is now accepted in relation to military 
security." 
 <p>
Another model for a global tax is hidden in the UN Convention on the 
Law of the Sea, a UN treaty the Clinton Administration is trying to 
get the Senate to ratify. This treaty sets up a global taxing 
authority called the International Seabed Authority to collect fees 
and royalties imposed on American mining firms. 
 <p>
An outfit called Worldwatch Institute issued a report this year called 
"Partnership for the Planet." It calls for a global tax to finance 
"the transition to a sustainable society -- including environmental 
programs, social initiatives, and peacekeeping efforts." 
 <p>
Just as the new Republican Congress is trying to put a lid on welfare 
and Medicare entitlements, the UN is planning to saddle U.S. taxpayers 
with global entitlements. The Oxfam Poverty Report proclaims that 
"international aid should be seen as a financial entitlement, and as 
part of a compact between citizens in the industrial and developing 
worlds." 
 <p>
UN bureaucrats and advocates must be having lots of fun dreaming up 
ways to tax Americans to support their notions of "global 
neighborhood" and "sustainable human development." The Ford Foundation 
produced a study last year called "Renewing the United Nations 
System," which advocates an annual "United Nations lottery, 
administered by a special authority under the Secretary-General." 
 <p>
The Ford Foundation also financed a report called "The United Nations 
in Its Second Half-Century," which calls for allowing the UN to have 
Special Drawing Rights from the International Monetary Fund. 
Rationalized as a "levy on the utilization of the global commons," 
this proposal would enable the UN to bypass Congress in accessing U.S. 
taxpayers' money. 
 <p>
Other wealthy liberal foundations that have helped orchestrate the 
demand for a global tax include the MacArthur and Carnegie 
Foundations. The World Federalist Association, now headed by former 
presidential candidate John B. Anderson, weighs in with a 
recommendation for UN taxes on international travel and postal 
service. 
 <p>
Bella Abzug, who was so visible in the recent UN Women's Conference in 
Beijing, also serves as a member of the advisory council of the Global 
Commission to Fund the United Nations. It comes as no surprise that 
she endorses global taxes as a way to finance and enforce the radical 
feminist agenda that she presented at the UN conferences on population 
and women's issues. 
 <p>
Americans had better wake up and expel the UN before it succeeds in 
any of its arrogant global taxing plans. Congress should hold hearings 
on the outrageous global tax schemes exposed by researcher Cliff 
Kincaid for Americans for Tax Reform.

<html><head><title>Schlafly: Don't Turn the Clock Back to Rockefeller Republicanism
</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<h2>Don't Turn the Clock Back to Rockefeller Republicanism</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
Ever since the four-term phenomenon of Franklin D. Roosevelt, two very 
different factions have wrestled for control of the Republican Party. 
On the one hand are the grassroots Republicans, Main Street Americans, 
who labor in the precincts to elect candidates they hope will be 
faithful after election.
<p> 
On the other hand are the powerful people who fancy themselves as 
kingmakers, the wheelers and dealers of the proverbial smoke- filled 
rooms, also known as the New York or Wall Street or eastern liberal 
establishment. They include the multinational corporations (whose most 
recent accomplishment was the Mexican bailout) and the Business 
Roundtable types, whose fingers of control slither through what is 
called the media elite. 
<p>
These kingmakers are Big Government Republicans. They seek to maintain 
the current high level of federal spending, and they want to control 
how the money is spent. They are liberals, but their favorite word to 
identify themselves is "moderate." 
<p>
In 1940 the New York kingmakers created the 60-day wonder named 
Wendell Willkie. He was a registered Democrat, but the kingmakers 
manufactured a new image for him through a media blitz and made him 
the Republican nominee for President. 
<p>
In 1944 and 1948, the kingmakers forced the Republican Party to 
nominate the man who brought the expression "me too" into the 
political lexicon. Voters opted for the real Democrat in 1944 and 
1948, not the carbon copy. 
<p>
In 1952 the New York kingmakers felt threatened by the rise of the 
conservative movement led by Senator Bob Taft. The issue was clear: 
Taft had pledged to reduce the level of federal spending 
significantly, so the liberal Republicans set out to defeat him at all 
costs. By the narrowest of margins, the New York kingmakers stole the 
1952 Republican National Convention for a military hero, Dwight 
Eisenhower. 
<p>
During Ike's two terms, the liberals initiated all kinds of big 
federal spending programs that have plagued us ever since, such as 
federal aid to education. It was no surprise that Republican seats in 
Congress steadily declined. 
<p>
In 1964, the New York kingmakers tried to force Republicans to 
nominate Nelson Rockefeller, a Big Government, internationalist 
Republican Governor who raised taxes, engaged in profligate spending 
of the taxpayers' money, and me-tooed the liberal Democratic policies. 
They failed; grassroots conservatives asserted their majority position 
in the Republican Party by nominating Barry Goldwater and repudiating 
Rockefeller Republicanism. 
<p>
The Rockefeller cabal then cooperated with the media moguls in a 
campaign to defeat Goldwater that was marked by unprecedented hysteria 
and vicious smears. The result was Lyndon B. Johnson and the 
exponential expansion of Big Government under the Great Society. 
<p>
In the following years, conservatives were cowed by a constant 
refrain. "You conservatives had your chance with Barry Goldwater. His 
defeat proves America will never elect a conservative, so the best you 
can hope for is Richard Nixon." 
<p>
The Nixon regime proved that conservatives are fools to accept half a 
loaf. In foreign policy, his appointee Henry Kissinger continued the 
disastrous McNamara policies of abandoning our strategic superiority 
to the Soviets. In domestic policy, Nixon admitted he was a Keynesian 
and even inflicted price controls on us. 
<p>
In 1976 the fainthearted persuaded a scant majority of Republicans to 
stick with the "moderate," Gerald Ford. However, even that "moderate" 
Republican National Convention was unwilling to take Rockefeller as 
Ford's running mate. 
<p>
Finally, in 1980, Ronald Reagan mainstreamed conservatism as the 
vision and the values of Middle America. He drew conservative and pro-
family Democrats and independents into the Republican Party. 
<p>
Reagan's vision of conservatism consists of four specific elements: 
limited government with lower taxes; personal responsibility with a 
disdain for taxpayer handouts for personal or social causes; military 
superiority so our armed forces can protect our independence 
(specifically including SDI); and respect for life and family values. 
<p>
Each of these four elements of Reagan's conservatism has a large 
constituency among the American people. The coalition produced the 
greatest Presidency and the biggest Republican victories of our times. 
This Reagan coalition is the model for the future of the Republican 
Party, and casting off any of them would spell defeat for Republicans. 
<p>
It is a puzzlement why Colin Powell identified himself as a 
"Rockefeller Republican," when Nelson Rockefeller was the 
quintessential representative of the eastern liberal establishment. To 
the grassroots conservatives who are now the dominant majority in the 
Republican Party, Rockefeller Republicanism means "in your face" Big 
Government liberalism. 
<p>
To nominate a Rockefeller Republican in 1996 would be turning the 
clock back to 1964 when that crowd lost the watershed battle between 
grassroots conservatives vs. the establishment. It would be as foolish 
as refighting the Civil Rights Act, the other defining battle of 1964. 
<p>
The Reagan model teaches us that authentic conservatism is the road to
 victory. Conservative Republicans don't have to settle for a me-tooer 
or a liberal or a "moderate" masquerading as a conservative because 
conservatives have the votes to demand the real thing. <p>

<h2>Republicans Want Answers From  
                          Presidential Candidates</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P>                    
  

We can debate whether or not the media really tell us what to think, 
but they surely tell us what to think about. The 1996 presidential 
election is still almost a year away, but the media have been forcing 
us to think about it since the beginning of 1995. By the time it is 
over, it will have been nearly a two-year stretch, and we are already 
tired of it. 

Despite the persistent pressures from the perennial pollsters, 
Republican voters are a stubborn lot and a big percentage simply 
refuses to make a choice. Most presidential hopefuls are still 
clustered in single digits. 
<p>
The fact that Ronald Reagan was in single digits at this point before 
his first election doesn't dissuade the media from their demands. The 
abrupt departure from the race of Pete Wilson and then Colin Powell, 
both supposedly ten-ton gorillas, didn't pry Republican voters loose 
from the category of "undecided." 
<p>
Bob Dole's substantial lead is probably the result of, as Morton 
Kondracke has pointed out, the Republican Party's preference for 
primogeniture. As the senior pol, Dole's in line; he's been in office 
so long he deserves it, or so the thinking goes. 
<p>
But political parties aren't hereditary. Voters usually select their 
candidates on the basis of their likability, their articulation of a 
mix of views on issues that voters care about, and the vision and 
leadership they manifest. 
<p>
Most of the presidential political discussion seems to be along the 
following lines. Who wins straw polls among other politicians? Who 
raises the most money? Who has held more important government jobs? 
<p>
Maybe the voters just donþt care about those factors, and thatþs why 
they are holding back. So what issues do the voters care about? 
<p>
What are called the sovereignty questions are the preeminent issues 
that presidential candidates should talk about because they concern 
national integrity and survival. Voters want the answers to a whole 
cluster of questions like these. 
<p>
Do you support barring President Clinton from sending American troops 
to Bosnia by cutting off all taxpayers' money? Where do you stand on 
the prospective Army court-martial of a U.S. soldier for refusing to 
wear the United Nations uniform? 
<p>
Will you stop sending American money to the UN to involve us in 
foreign wars, a practice dishonestly described as "peacekeeping"? Will 
you oppose all efforts to allow the UN to grab any kind of taxing 
power, and will you cut off all money to the World Bank if it diverts 
any of its funds to the UN? 
<p>
Will you oppose the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (as Ronald 
Reagan did) and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (promoted 
by Hillary Rodham Clinton)? 
<p>
Will you candidly admit that NAFTA has cost tens of thousands of 
American jobs and take steps to remedy the manifold injuries to 
American workers and taxpayers? Will you get us out of the World Trade 
Organization? 
<p>
What are you going to do about the Mexican bailout? Do you pledge that 
you will never again allow U.S. taxpayers' money to be used to shore 
up foreign currency? 
<p>
What is your plan to stop illegal immigration and to cut off all 
taxpayer benefits to the illegal aliens who are already in this 
country? Will you support a moratorium on legal immigration until we 
deal with the illegal immigration problem? 
<p>
Do you support making English our official language? Will you cut off 
all taxpayer support of foreign language ballots and the language 
apartheid enforced on public schoolchildren in the name of "bilingual 
education"? 
<p>
What is your stand on term limits, secret pay raises for Congressmen, 
and Congressional pensions? Will ou cut off taxpayers' handout to 
wealthy organizations such as Planned Parenthood and AARP? 
<p>
Are you going to cancel all federal regulations that impose 
affirmative action quotas or set-asides? 
<p>
Education and crime are certainly two hot-button concerns, but they 
are not primarily federal issues. Most of what the Federal Government 
is doing in those areas does not address the real problems, and some 
of what the Federal Government is doing is downright detrimental. 
<p>
It's not the job of the President to reform public schools or see that 
the children are taught how to read and write, but it would be helpful 
if presidential candidates would promise to eliminate federal control 
by abolishing the Department of Education and Goals 2000. 
<p>
Likewise, crime control is and should be primarily a state and local 
matter. But it would be helpful if the Federal Government would get 
moving with prosecutions for the killings carried out by federal 
agents at Ruby Ridge and Waco. 
<p>
Voters want their candidates to address the fact that so many 
Americans feel that government is their enemy, not their protector. 
They want candidates to address specifics such as the government's 
taking of private lands at the behest of the environmental extremists 
and proposals to allow Janet Reno to wiretap the phones of every 
American. 
<p>
Many voters are likely to remain undecided as long as the candidates 
dodge the issues they really care about. <p>

<h2>America Has No Business In Bosnia </h2> 

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>

<p><hr><P> 
                      
  
 
So President Clinton wants to send 20,000 American soldiers to Bosnia. 
The man who ducked out of serving in the Vietnam War now says it's our 
duty to send other men's sons to fight a foreign war. 
<P>
Clinton says he has already committed 20,000 troops and now an 
unsuspecting nation is told we must go along because "he gave his 
word." But Clinton made that rash and casual promise on his own; the 
rest of us are not a party to the deal. And since when is "his word" 
inviolate? 
<P>
Clinton is trying to tell Americans that going to Bosnia is our moral 
duty. But he is no oracle of moral law. We didn't start the war, it 
isn't our obligation to stop it, and foreign policy should not be used 
for social work. 
<P>
Unable to show any vital national interest, the Clinton spin salesmen 
have instructed all Administration spokesmen to say that troops are 
needed in Bosnia to protect our "values," although they never say what 
values they are talking about. The word has no meaning in relation to 
the Bosnia decision; its use is just a cheap attempt to paper over the 
Administration's lack of any reasonable argument. 
<P>
Clinton says we must assert American leadership in the world. But the 
kind of leadership America should assert is political leadership in 
showing the superiority of freedom over totalitarianism, and economic 
leadership in demonstrating the superiority of the free market over 
socialism and government planning. 
<P>
Clinton asserts that it is his prerogative as Commander-in-Chief to 
send troops to Bosnia. But his constitutional authority to dispatch 
troops is only for the purpose of defending Americans or vital 
American interests, not to rush out and join a war that is none of our 
business. Only Congress has the constitutional power to go to war. 
<P>
Clinton argues that we should go into Bosnia to keep the fighting from 
spreading into a bigger war. But he's got it exactly backwards. It is 
U.S. involvement and casualties that turn a local fight into a world 
event. 
<P>
Clinton says our troops will be "peacekeepers." But there is no peace 
in Bosnia; all sides hate each other and one of the warring parties 
has refused to ratify the Dayton accord. Nor can the United States 
pretend to be neutral so soon after we bombed the Serb secessionists. 
<P>
Even if there were peace, U.S. servicemen are not policemen and should 
not be forced to assume that role. Policemen and soldiers are trained 
for different missions, and those purposes should not be blurred. 
<P>
It's not at all clear that anyone can stop the fighting. Balkan 
nations have fought each other for over 500 years, and too much blood 
has been shed over little pieces of land for the enmity to disappear 
in the 12 months of our projected deployment there. 
<P>
The Dayton agreement creates a new Bosnian state with indefensible 
borders and a collective presidency with, in rotation, a Muslim, a 
Serb and a Croat as chairman. Under this inherently unstable 
arrangement, each side will have its own army! 
<P>
If it is truly in the vital interest of Europe to stop the 
bloodletting in the former Yugoslavia, let the European countries send 
whatever troops are necessary. Europe has plenty of money and manpower 
to take on the task. 
<P>
Despite the lack of a clear mission as to why we are going in, what 
good we can accomplish, and when we will get out, the entire liberal 
and internationalist establishment plus the media elite are lining up 
to support Clinton's expedition into Bosnia. Let's look at the reasons 
for this curious propaganda push. 
<P>
They want to give NATO something to do before the American people 
realize that NATO has completed its mission of stopping the Soviets 
from invading Europe and now ought to be retired. The Warsaw Pact is 
already "history," but NATO careerists want to keep their bureaucracy 
going through "mission creep." 
<P>
The internationalists remember how hard it was to get the United 
States involved in World Wars I and II. They think that, if they can 
just keep U.S. troops constantly marching around in Europe on any 
make-work project, America will be caught right in the middle if and 
when another big war starts. 
<P>
The internationalists want to get the United States in some kind of 
world government and, since the United Nations is in such disfavor, 
NATO can serve as a useful stepping stone. Using NATO instead of the 
UN will avoid the criticisms about U.S. servicemen wearing UN uniforms 
or serving under foreign commanders. 
<P>
The American people are looking for a leader who will stand up to 
Clinton and say "NO, we are not going to let you drag our nation into 
a foreign war that is none of our business." We are looking for a 
Senator and a Representative who will lead the battle in Congress to 
<P>
cut off all money for use in Bosnia, which Congress has every right 
and constitutional authority to do. 
<P>
And one more thing: "OK with conditions" is not acceptable. We want a 
leader to "just say NO."

<h2>Bilingualism Is The Wrong Way To Go</h2> 

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
For the last five years, Political Correctness has forced the academic (and  
much of the political) world to pay homage to the new sacred cows called  
multiculturalism and diversity. Those are usually used as code words to  
challenge the assumption that Western Civilization is the basis of what we  
call the American system, and to pretend that all cultures are equal and  
contributed equally to the America we know.  
 <p> 
This fad seems to be trying to get us to change our national identity from  
E pluribus unum (From the many, one) to E uno plures (From the one, many).  <p>
Indeed, Vice President Al Gore's goof last year indicates that he has  
already made that transition.  
 <p> 
But cultures are not so easily rationalized. Cultures are grounded in  
deeply held emotions, history and relationships that defy logical analysis.  
The separatist movement in Quebec and the fighting in Bosnia are two recent  
evidences of how inherited cultures cause bitter, current problems.  
  <p>
The United States is the world's most stunning example of a nation that has  
peaceably and successfully assimilated people from many disparate cultures.  <p>
So why are some people trying to separate us into factions, emphasizing  
what divides us instead of what unites us?  
  <p>
The $8 billion bureaucratic failure called "bilingual education" keeps more  
than two million immigrant children in a three-to-five year program where  
as much as 90 percent of their school day is spent in their native  
language. Sometimes their teachers speak almost no English.  
  <p>
New York City students are taught in 82 languages, including Kpelle,  
Nyanja, Twi, Gurma, Ewe, Cham, and others most Americans have never heard  
of. The bureaucrats try to put all children with Hispanic-sounding names in  
bilingual education programs even though they may be fully English-speaking  
and come from English- speaking homes.  
  <p>
The term bilingual education is a complete misnomer because there is no  
requirement that children in bilingual programs ever become fluent in  
English. Our tax dollars are used to promote unilingual education in the  
immigrant's native tongue, and this is nurturing a permanent,  
non-English-speaking subculture.  
  <p>
Without any proof that bilingual classes promote their announced purpose,  
and despite the opposition of the majority of those the program is supposed  
to serve, the bilingual education lobby has shifted its objective. It is  
now trying to make foreign language and culture an integral component of  
American society.  
  <p>
Some advocates see bilingual education as the first step in a radical  
transformation of the United States into a nation without one common  
language or fixed borders. Josue Gonzales, director of bilingual education  
during the Carter Administration and now a professor at Columbia University  
Teachers College, says that Spanish "should no longer be regarded as a  
foreign language" but should be considered "a second national language."  
  <p>
Some in the bilingual lobby have even more extreme views. At the annual  
conference of the National Association for Bilingual Education in Phoenix  
in February 1995, several speakers challenged the very idea of U.S.  
sovereignty and promoted the notion that the Southwest and northern Mexico  
are really one cultural region, which they call La Frontera.  
  <p>
Eugene Garcia, head of bilingual education at the U.S. Department of  
Education in the Clinton Administration, told the conferees that "the  
border for many is nonexistent. For me, for intellectual reasons, that  
border shall be nonexistent." His rhetoric was greeted by thunderous  
applause.  <p>
  
The November 1994 meeting of the Texas Association for Bilingual Education  
in Austin featured both the Mexican and American flags on the stage. The  
teachers and school personnel in attendance stood for the singing of the  
national anthems of both countries. The political battle over California's  
Proposition 187 in 1994 featured a huge demonstration of people marching  
with Mexican, not U.S., flags.  
  <p>
The bilingual movement should be stopped before it causes any more damage  
to our national fabric. At least it should be stopped insofar as this lobby  
is financed by the taxpayers, and those who work for separatist causes  
should do so on their own dollar, not ours.  
  <p>
Rep. Toby Roth (R-WI), with 91 co-sponsors, has introduced a bill to make  
English our official language. It would end the government's multilingual  
policies, including bilingual education, voting ballots in languages other  
than English, and foreign language citizenship ceremonies.  
  <p>
You can't be an American if you don't speak English. Our public schools  
should be mandated to teach all children in English.  
  <p>
President Theodore Roosevelt said it best: "The one absolute certain way of  
bringing this nation to ruin would be to permit it to become a tangle of  
squabbling nationalities. We have but one flag. We must also have but one  
language, and that language is English."

<h2>The Health Care Dilemma of Patients Who Can't Read</h2>

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P>
"Our health care system requires that patients be able to read." That 
ought to be a self-evident truth that is silly to enunciate, but it is 
actually the sensational revelation of a major problem just made 
public in the December JAMA (Journal of the American Medical 
Association). 
<p>
The JAMA article reports on the first study ever made to test literacy 
using words combined with numbers that are in common use in health 
care. It was a cross-sectional research project conducted at two urban 
hospitals, one in Georgia, the other in California. 
<p>
The massive National Adult Literacy Survey made by the U.S. government 
in 1993 concluded that 40 to 44 million adults are functionally 
illiterate and that another 50 million are only marginally literate. 
This new health literacy study specifically measured the ability of 
patients to read and understand medical instructions and health care 
information according to a test called TOFHLA (Test of Functional 
Health Literacy in Adults) and discovered that 33 percent of patients 
did not understand instructions for common procedures written at the 
fourth grade level. 
<p>
This health literacy study measured the ability of patients to perform 
such tasks as reading labels on prescription bottles, instructions 
about how often to take medication, notices about when is the next 
doctor's appointment, informed consent forms, instructions about 
diagnostic tests, and how to complete insurance forms. The depressing 
conclusion is that a high percentage of patients simply can't read 
well enough to function in our health care system. 
<p>
People with inadequate literacy skills are unable to read a 
thermometer, write down instructions by telephone, or read common 
medical terms such as "orally," "teaspoon," and "hours." <p>They can't 
access useful messages from newspaper and magazine articles, 
educational materials, posters in supermarkets, or billboards about 
the importance of screening procedures or flu shots. 
<p>
Health care standards require hospitals to provide patients with 
understandable health instructions, but do not require that the 
instructions be understood. Hospitals assume they are complying if 
they give patients a readable document, but a written instruction 
assumes that the patients can read. 
<p>
Patients who can't read informed consent forms present doctors and 
hospitals with what the researchers call "a troubling ethical issue." <p>
Even if an effort is made to simplify the forms to the sixth grade 
level, that still will not reach the many who are functionally 
illiterate. 
<p>
This health literacy project turned up other new and useful 
information not hitherto unearthed by previous literacy surveys made 
by educational institutions. 
<p>
Neither appearance nor years of schooling adequately predicts 
illiteracy. This means that illiteracy is not just a problem for 
minority dropouts or recent immigrants, but is a handicap suffered by 
all races and classes of people who have no visible signs of 
disability and have spent many years in school. 
<p>
Many illiterates do not realize that they have a problem. They are 
like myopic children who don't know that they are simply not seeing 
details that others see. 
<p>
Ronald Reagan tells in his autobiography how, as a young boy riding in 
the back seat of an automobile, he picked up someone else's glasses 
and tried them on. Suddenly he was able to see the leaves on the trees 
and other landscape details for the first time. Until that moment of 
revelation, he hadn't known that other children had been seeing so 
many things that he did not see. 
<p>
The predicament of illiterates is similar. Never having been able to 
communicate with the printed word, they have no comprehension of the 
vast world from which they are excluded. 
<p>
Even more prevalent is the pervasive problem of shame. People with 
limited literacy skills try to hide their inability to read. The large 
majority of illiterates describe themselves as reading and writing 
"well" or "very well." 
<p>
The health literacy study shows that, among patients with low literacy 
skills, 67.2 percent have never told their spouse, 53.4 percent have 
never told their own children, and 19 percent have never told anyone 
at all. 
<p>
I can confirm this from my own experience. In counseling adults, I 
frequently hear such confessions as "I can't read big words" and "I 
just discovered that my husband can't read." 
<p>
The health literacy study admits that patients' noncompliance with 
their medical instructions has been generally assumed by physicians 
and hospitals to be caused by poor motivation or different personal 
values. The study calls for a reevaluation of patients who have been 
labelled "uncooperative"; it is more likely that doctors and hospital 
personnel, to whom reading is as natural as breathing, never imagined 
that the patients just couldn't read their instructions. 
<p>
The JAMA article recognizes that illiteracy is not a disease and its 
solution cannot be medicalized. Since doctors and hospitals can't 
provide the solution, and the schools have obviously failed in the 
task, parents will have to take on the responsibility of teaching 
their children how to read.

<h2>
AMERICA LATINA: MAS MITOS QUE METAS
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Luis Aguilar León*
</a>

<P>
MIAMI (AIPE).-  Proclamar que la América Latina está en crisis implica un
cierto simplismo. La América Latina vive en crisis. Desde la batalla de
Ayacucho hasta nuestros días, la historia de la América Latina es la
historia de una crisis.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En ocasiones la crisis estalla en revoluciones y golpes de estado;
usualmente se desarrolla con reprimida violencia, últimamente, cuando la
democracia ha asomado su vendada cabeza en el continente, flotan los ecos de
enormes deudas externas, guerrillas con máscaras de narcotráfico (o
viceversa), roces fronterizos y, sobre todo, una corrupción oficial que,
como una ola de mugre, se abate sobre el continente derribando presidentes,
ministros, partidos y debilitando al propio sistema democrático.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Cabe preguntarse: ¿Hacia dónde va la América Latina?  ¿Dónde están los
planes de futuro?, ¿cuáles son las metas reales?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Las respuestas podrían comenzar señalando que la América Latina vive tan
intensamente algunos mitos que apenas si se preocupa por señalarse metas.
Hace más de 150 años, por ejemplo, nos proclamamos jóvenes y, hasta hace muy
poco, excusábamos todo tropiezo como natural error de la inexperiencia. Nada
aprendimos de aquella ironía de Oscar Wilde: "La juventud de América es una
de sus más viejas tradiciones".
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Después surgió el mito de nuestra latinidad, una fórmula defensiva de una
elite criolla en busca de una identidad rasgada por aquel comentario de
Bolívar: "Si no somos ni indios, ni negros, ni europeos, ¿qué somos?". Las
minorías cultas dieron con una respuesta luminosa: somos latinos. Y así de
golpe, a pura voluntad, nos adscribimos a un teórico mundo latino, a la
vieja Roma y, sobre todo, a nuestra amada Francia.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El amor de los latinoamericanos por Francia es uno de los fenómenos más
curiosos de la historia. Francia nunca se ocupó mucho de la América Latina,
excepto para enviar tropas a Haití, a México y la marina de guerra a la
Argentina. Pero todo se le perdonaba a la madre Francia, tierra de poetas
egregios, "maestra de la vida risueña", cuyo París los latinoamericanos
sentían como suyo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En las casas de las elites cultas no podían faltar grabados y libros
franceses. Los latinos aprendían La Marsellesa antes de aprender los himnos
nacionales. El genio de Víctor Hugo producía vértigos. Tan apasionada
admiración no hubiera sido dañina, que Francia mucho nos podía enseñar, si
no hubiera desembocado en una más deletérea exageración: el culpar a los
yankees por todos los males del continente.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En 1898, sacudidas por la derrota de España y por la evidencia del
poderío norteamericano, las minorías latinoamericanas exacerbaron ese otro
rostro del mito. Casi sin quererlo, el uruguayo José Enrique Rodó esbozó la
fórmula. Los gringos son ricos, poderosos, industriales y trabajadores, pero
son como Calibán, les falta alma, no tienen verdadera cultura, no son
espirituales. En cambio los latinos son como Ariel, los anima el espíritu,
son los hijos y descendientes del imperio romano y de la inmortal Atenas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Como siempre, el mito estranguló la meta. Saltando sobre la realidad
histórica, olvidándonos de que, como descubrió más tarde Benito Mussolini,
los italianos de hoy no son descendientes de los romanos de César, los
latinoamericanos nos dedicamos a solazarnos en nuestra espiritualidad y a
maldecir al pujante yankee, el Mr. Danger de Rómulo Gallegos, que nos
despreciaba. En vez de aprender por qué el Norte era poderoso para, como
aconsejaba Sarmiento, encontrar el camino del éxito, se nos enseñó que era
peligroso volvernos "materialistas", embijarnos con la industrialización,
estudiar y adoptar urgentísimas reformas. Ariel, con su alada visión del
mundo, no tenía que preocuparse de tales bajos menesteres, le bastaba
alimentarse de sueños y retórica.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Ante tal desmesuramiento del mito de nuestra latinidad, se explica el
sarcasmo del peruano Manuel González Prada:
<blockquote>"Aquí yace Carlos Oblongo,
de pura estirpe latina...
la madre llegó del Congo,
y el padre vino de China..."</blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Las dos guerras mundiales, y la tajante realidad de un mundo dividido en
pueblos desarrollados y subdesarrollados, ayudaron a disipar algo el sueño
de la espiritualidad latina. Pero para entonces el mito había contribuido al
daño colectivo. Nos habíamos quedado a la zafa de la industrialización. Y
dentro de nuestro hipotético mundo latino, masas empobrecidas reclamaban su
derecho al progreso.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Frente a tal ineludible realidad, las minorías latinas revitalizaron tres
viejos mitos: la hermandad latinoamericana, el indigenismo, y la obligación
del Estado de ser padre y protector de todos los ciudadanos. Los países de
población india cantaron al mestizaje, lo cual era bien justo, y proclamaron
la superioridad de las culturas precolombinas sobre la española, lo cual es
bien discutible. Y todos los gobiernos, dictaduras o democracias,
continuaron el paternalismo estatal, padre de parálisis y de corrupción.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Ahí está, entre muchos problemas, la corrupción política que debilita y
mina todo esfuerzo. ¿Y por qué no buscamos métodos para embridarla? ¿Con
cuál mito vamos a encubrir nuestra responsabilidad colectiva?

<title>LA INVENCIBLE BUROCRACIA -- 11/14/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>LA INVENCIBLE BUROCRACIA
</h2>
Luis Aguilar L.*<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Me comentaban no hace mucho unos viajeros argentinos que el
presidente Menem está haciendo un vigoroso esfuerzo por podar las ramas de
la frondosa burocracia argentina. "Usted sabe", me decían "que hasta hace
poco conseguir un teléfono en Buenos Aires era tan problemático como viajar
a la luna". Claro que lo sabía. En el Buenos Aires de antaño la tardanza era
a veces tan dilatada que, cuando llegaba el teléfono, era depositado
respetuosamente en la tumba del fallecido aplicante.
<p>
Las palabras no mitigaban mi escepticismo. La burocracia es como un ave
fénix que brota más vigorosa de sus propias cenizas. Ahora, por ejemplo, ha
llegado la burocracia telefónica. Esa metálica voz invisible que, si uno
llama al hospital, le dice "si usted está grave apriete el dos, si ya se ha
muerto apriete el tres, que es la funeraria".
<p>
Es bueno recordar que la palabra "burocracia" tiene la misma raíz latina
que "burla" y que "buró". Un burócrata es, por tanto, un señor que desde su
"buró" se burla de la gente que espera por su atención. La especie, mucho
más visible en los países del Tercer Mundo, se extiende por todo el globo.
<p>
En el mundo socialista la burocracia asfixia. Siempre he mantenido que a la
Unión Soviética la hundió una burocracia cada vez más fuerte y un vodka cada
vez más débil. Por su parte, a Fidel Castro le humean las barbas cuando
habla de la burocracia cubana. "Aquí no se puede hacer nada sin firmar diez
mil papeles", gritó una vez el líder iracundo. "Y cada vez que nombro una
comisión para erradicar el problema, la comisión crece, se expande y se suma
al monstruo burocrático".
<p>
Conozco el caso de un brasileño que se casó en Sao Paulo con una
portuguesa. En esa época la ley exigía que todos los documentos expedidos en
el extranjero tenían que ser traducidos por una institución oficial.
Portugal no había sido excluido. Como consecuencia, mi amigo tuvo que llevar
al Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores todos los documentos de su futura
esposa para que fueran "oficialmente" traducidos del portugués al portugués.
<p>
En España, el genial Wenceslao Fernández Flores ilustraba la situación con
un cuento travieso. Un día, un científico español descubrió un método
revolucionario de enlatar sardinas. Sabiendo que la exportación de sardinas
era vital para España, el inventor corrió al Ministerio de Industria. Fue
recibido con la usual impasibilidad. Se le dijo que la aprobación del
Ministerio de Economía era indispensable. Allá voló el anheloso inventor. Le
pidieron pruebas de la patente; lo enviaron a otros departamentos; le
exigieron sellos, firmas, declaraciones de planos y documentos de confirmación.
<p>
Exasperado ante tales murallas de papel, con menos libras y más canas, el
inventor retornó al Ministerio de Industria. "¿Pero es que ustedes no se dan
cuenta de que tengo en mis manos la prosperidad de España?", se quejó; "¿Es
que no se dan cuenta de que mientras aquí perdemos tiempo entre registros y
pruebas, algún extranjero puede descubrir la fórmula y regalarle a su país
la prosperidad que yo le ofrezco a España?".
<p>
El empleado de turno no se inmutó. "Cálmese amigo. No lo tome a pecho. Aquí
todo requiere tiempo. ¿Ve usted aquel viejito sentado en ese banco?". El
inventor le tiró una ojeada a un venerable anciano de luengas barbas blancas
que fumaba plácidamente. "Pues bien", prosiguió el empleado, "ese señor
descubrió hace setenta años cómo construir aviones de propulsión a chorro.
Era entonces un joven fogoso como usted y luchó hasta el final. Hace diez
años, el ministerio le otorgó permiso de fabricación. Claro que ya ni la
patente tiene sentido ni él se acuerda del invento, pero, después de tantos
años, sigue viniendo a visitarnos a fumar y a conversar. Este ministerio es
su casa".
<p>
Podría multiplicar ejemplos, hay algunos de una cierta delirante
originalidad. Como pasar por Guatemala cuando se inauguró el Ministerios de
Asuntos Específicos. Lo cual me dejó pensando: ¿qué tipo de asuntos se
tratan en otros ministerios, asuntos metafísicos? Pero prefiero terminar con
la aventura de un empresario en Francia.
<p>
Una vez, en París, un hombre de negocios norteamericano llegó jadeante y
presuroso a un ministerio de algo. Eran apenas las cuatro de la tarde y el
ministerio estaba desierto. "¿Qué es esto?", le preguntó atónito a un viejo
empleado que trapeaba lánguidamente los pisos. "¿Es que aquí no se trabaja
por las tardes?". Interrumpiendo su labor, y con una ironía volteriana, el
francés le explicó la situación: "Aquí mon ami, los empleados no vienen por
la tarde y no trabajan por la mañana... tu comprend?". Y prosiguió su
metódica limpieza del piso. ©

<h2>
CAUSA COMUN DE LIBERALES Y CATOLICOS
</h2>

Manuel Ayau*

<P>
CIUDAD DE GUATEMALA  <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Las antiguas diferencias existentes entre la
Iglesia Católica y los liberales en América Latina siguen teniendo
resultados desastrosos. ¿Hay alguna esperanza de reconciliación? Pienso que sí.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Cuando a los 13 años ingresé a un colegio católico interno en California,
me impresionó la notable diferencia de los católicos en Norteamérica. Quizás
el hecho que en el Nuevo Mundo hispánico el catolicismo gozaba de una
posición predominante con respecto a otras religiones explicaba esa posición
altanera y arrogante que no era el caso en Estados Unidos, donde al tratarse
de una minoría era más abierta y tolerante. Esa mayor tolerancia de los
católicos anglosajones abarcaba también una filosofía económica y política
más liberal.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Lamentablemente, la Iglesia Católica en América Latina heredó de España un
prejuicio antiliberal y su antagonismo hacia el sistema capitalista, aunque
hay que aclarar que no hubo tal antagonismo contra los capitalistas mientras
estos formaban parte del sistema mercantilista, en el que la misma Iglesia
Católica jugaba un papel protagónico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El mundo anglosajón tomó el camino capitalista, alejándose del
mercantilismo criticado en lo moral y en lo económico por Adam Smith,
provocando mejoras sin precedentes en las condiciones de la humanidad. Los
católicos anglosajones se beneficiaron del liberalismo económico y de la
Revolución Industrial, mientras que en Estados Unidos el federalismo -que
significa la descentralización del poder y el libre comercio entre los
estados- representó la creación del más grande y duradero mercado común de
la historia moderna. Es difícil ser anticapitalista con una experiencia tan
exitosa, aunque algunos sigan tratando. En el mundo anglosajón el término
liberal se asociaba con virtud y compasión, por lo que el apelativo fue
raptado por los defensores del colectivismo, del paternalismo y de la
sociedad irresponsable. Por el contrario, en el mundo hispano la palabra
liberal sonaba impía, anticlerical y mezquina.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	A pesar de los esfuerzos del Papa Juan Pablo II, la alta jerarquía de la
Iglesia en América Latina no ha hecho un esfuerzo sincero en comprender la
esencia de la controversia ni en dejar atrás las actitudes del pasado. Sus
acciones indican no estar interesados en un análisis intelectual riguroso y
honesto, por lo que sigue prevaleciendo su condena generalizada contra todo
lo que suena a liberal o neoliberal. Hay excepciones, pero estas son más
raras a medida que se sube en la jerarquía de la Iglesia, lo cual tiende a
alejar de ella a los católicos liberales.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Como la mayoría de la población latinoamericana sigue hundida en la
pobreza, los sacerdotes deberían estudiar economía, comenzando con la
Escuela de Salamanca, para que sepan diferenciar entre el mercantilismo y el
capitalismo que ellos llaman, con desprecio, "neoliberalismo".
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Tan feliz como soy con la prosperidad creada por las privatizaciones y por
economías más abiertas, me decepciona que la actual transición hacia el
capitalismo es más bien pragmática, desposeída de principios éticos. La
palabra clave suele ser "eficiencia". Privatizar y desmonopolizar para
obtener mejor gerencia e ingresos fiscales, no como un acto de respeto hacia
los derechos de la gente de adquirir y vender su propiedad y de ejercer la
libertad de servir a los demás con su trabajo e ingenio. Abrir las fronteras
para hacer la economía más eficiente, no en reconocimiento del derecho de
los ciudadanos a intercambiar lo que es suyo, sin tener que ver con dónde
viven los compradores o vendedores. Evitar la inflación porque es
económicamente ineficiente y no porque se trata de una práctica deshonesta
de los gobernantes. Llego a pensar que si el socialismo hubiera resultado
económicamente eficiente todavía seguiría siendo respetable.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Lo que todavía muchos ignoran es que el mercado, como bien lo dijo Hayek,
se fundamenta en un sistema de reglas generales de justa conducta para
proteger los derechos individuales y el cumplimiento de contratos. Esa
generalizada desconfianza en el mercado se manifiesta en los intentos de
"regularlo", como si ya no estuviese regulado por reglas abstractas que
protegen la vida, la libertad y la propiedad. La búsqueda de un objetivo
común es el camino a la reconciliación entre católicos liberales y
antiliberales. Todos aspiramos a una sociedad más virtuosa, caritativa y
responsable, a una sociedad moral y antimercantilista.&copy; <p>

DESTELLO DE LIBERTAD
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

<P>
NUEVA YORK (AIPE).- La noche del 11 de abril, Lady Thatcher fue la oradora
durante la celebración del 50 aniversario de la Fundación para la Educación
Económica (FEE) en el Waldorf-Astoria. Prácticamente todos los defensore del
libre mercado, los derechos de propiedad y la libertad individual alrededor
del mundo han sido influenciados por la labor pionera de Leonard Read
(1898-1983) y por FEE, la institución por él fundada en 1946 para promover
la libertad, incrementar la comprensión pública de la economía de mercado y
reconocer lo perverso y nocivo de la intervención gubernamental.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Read nació en una granja en Michigan y decía que su entrenamiento
económico comenzó a los ocho años: "Mi padre me puso a ordeñar vacas desde
temprana edad y así aprendí la relación entre el trabajo y un litro de
leche. Todo lo demás en economía son aditamentos a esa lección básica".
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Cuando Read era director ejecutivo de la Cámara de Comercio más grande de
Estados Unidos, en Los Angeles, invitó al profesor Ludwig von Mises a dar
una serie de conferencias en 1944. Mises pensaba que lo que "realmente
importa es el resultado de la lucha intelectual entre los partidarios del
socialismo y los del capitalismo". En 1946, Mises ingresó a FEE, dictando
conferencias anuales a maestros, periodistas y estudiantes en la sede de
Irvington-on-Hudson.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La libertad siempre es una víctima de la guerra. Entonces la
"reconstrucción" estaba siendo planificada por los nuevos burócratas
internacionales. Las virtudes del Estado Bienestar, del Plan Marshall, de
los controles de precios y salarios se debatían apasionadamente. Mi primer
viaje a Estados Unidos fue en 1945; además del Empire State, lo que más me
impresionó fue que mi madre no podía comprar zapatos sin un cupón del
gobierno y que a papá le servían su café con una diminuta bolsita de azúcar.
Yo era demasiado joven para darme cuenta que el racionamiento y la escasez
son los resultados inevitables del control gubernamental sobre la economía
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;El año anterior, Friedrich von Hayek había publicado "Camino de
servidumbre", mostrando que la barbarie es la consecuencia no intencional
del fascismo, del comunismo y de la social democracia. Esa obra marcó el
renacimiento del liberalismo clásico y tuvo gran influencia en Estados Unidos.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard Read fue uno del selecto grupo de intelectuales invitados por Hayek
a reunirse en la aldea suiza de Mont Pelerin, en abril de 1947, donde se
fundó una sociedad para unir los entonces desperdigados esfuerzos por la
libertad. Seis miembros de FEE asistieron a esa conferencia y se
convertirían en frecuentes colaboradores de la revista The Freeman. Además
de Hayek, Mises y Read, otros distinguidos economistas, politólogos y
periodistas estuvieron en Mont Pelerin: Karl Popper, Milton Friedman, Lionel
Robbins, George Stigler, Fritz Machlup, Henry Hazzlitt, F.A. Harper,
Bertrand de Jouvenel, W. Röpke, Frank Knight, Walter Eucken, Aaron Director,
John Davenport, etc.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Read, FEE y su revista tuvieron una extraordinaria influencia en el
surgimiento de instituciones liberales por todo nuestro hemisferio,
especialmente en la Argentina, México y Guatemala. Alberto Benegas Lynch,
presidente de la Cámara de Comercio de Buenos Aires, conoció a Read, Mises y
Hayek durante un viaje a Nueva York en 1950. Benegas, quien a los 86 años
sigue siendo un incansable luchador por la libertad, fundó en 1957 el Centro
de Estudios sobre la Libertad y una revista similar a la de FEE. Su hijo
Alberto recibió en 1968 una beca de FEE para completar su tesis de doctorado
en Estados Unidos y hoy es director de la Escuela Superior de Economía y
Administración en Buenos Aires.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alejandro Chafuén es otro de varios argentinos becados por FEE. Se casó y
se quedó a vivir en Estados Unidos, conociendo a Sir Antony Fisher, fundador
del Institute of Economic Affairs en Londres, la institución que hizo
posible la revolución thatcheriana en Inglaterra. Sir Antony había visitado
FEE en 1952, quedando impresionado por la forma de popularizar la economía
de mercado, a través de programas educacionales. Después de fundar lo que
hoy es el Manhattan Institute, Sir Antony estableció el Atlas Economic
Research Foundation para apoyar la labor de instituciones liberales por todo
el mundo. Chafuén es hoy presidente de Atlas.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;FEE también sirvió de modelo a los pioneros liberales en México: Luis
Montes de Oca, Gustavo Velasco y Agustín Navarro, fundadores del Instituto
de Investigaciones Sociales y Económicas, financiado principalmente por Hugo
Salinas Rocha. Montes de Oca había sido Secretario de Hacienda y presidente
del Banco Central. Velasco, profesor de leyes, era presidente de la
Asociación Bancaria, mientras que Navarro era el más distinguido periodista
independiente, cuando el PRI ejercía su férreo control sobre la prensa y el
suministro de papel. Ellos invitaron a Mises a México en 1942, 1946, 1949 y
1958. Hoy, Agustín Navarro hijo escribe una columna semanal para AIPE y es
presidente del Centro Mises. El nieto de Salinas, Roberto Salinas León, es
director ejecutivo del Centro de Estudios sobre la Libre Empresa y en enero
de este año organizó la primera reunión de la Sociedad Mont Pelerin
realizada en México.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;La directiva de FEE y Lady Thatcher entregaron durante la ceremonia del 50
aniversario una medalla a Manuel Ayau, de Guatemala, fundador en 1972 de la
Universidad Francisco Marroquín. Sus 12.000 estudiantes, no importa la
carrera, deben completar una instrucción básica en economía para graduarse.
Según Ayau, "el éxito debe depender de lo bien que se complazca a los
consumidores en el mercado y no de complacer al gobierno… la labor de los
amantes de la libertad está en la lucha contra el privilegio".
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Durante medio siglo FEE ha cambiado nuestras vidas promoviendo la libertad
en nuestro hemisferio y más allá. ©

<h2>
EL SUICIDIO DE UN ALMIRANTE
</h2>
Carlos A. Ball*
<P>
MIAMI <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Algo anda muy mal, cuando se pega un tiro el comandante en
jefe de operaciones navales de Estados Unidos, responsable por un millón de
uniformados. Los debiluchos de carácter e inseguros de sí mismo no alcanzan
esas posiciones y el historial del almirante Jeremy (Mike) Boorda indica
todo lo contrario. Se trataba de un hombre excepcional, el primero en la
armada de este país que comenzó como simple recluta para alcanzar la más
alta posición de las fuerzas navales.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;La noticia del jueves 16 de mayo fue que el almirante de 57 años se había
suicidado en su casa, dejando una corta nota dirigida "a los marineros",
cuyo texto no ha sido todavía revelado. La razón dada fue el acoso
periodístico por parte de la revista Newsweek que cuestionaba la utilización
de dos diminutas letras "v" (por valor en combate) en un par de
condecoraciones de Vietnam, cuando Boorda tenía el rango de teniente. En
efecto, esa tarde estaba pactada la entrevista -nunca efectuada- con un
reportero de la revista en su despacho, pero se debe aclarar que su
comandante en Vietnam, el almirante Elmo Zumwalt, afirmó que Mike Boorda sí
tenía derecho a lucir esas condecoraciones. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Se trata del más dramático acontecimiento en una escalada de ataques contra
la naval que comenzó con la ya famosa convención Tailhook de aviadores de la
armada en 1991, donde luego de seminarios y conferencias sobre temas navales
un grupo de oficiales de ambos sexos terminaron en borracheras y orgías. El
escándalo fue magnificado por las fuerzas feministas que consideran la
cultura de "hombres machos" que predomina en la naval como algo con lo cual
hay que terminar, de manera que las mujeres puedan gozar de algún tipo de
"acción afirmativa" dentro de la armada que les asegure compartir las más
altas posiciones en responsabilidad y en combate. Las feministas
consiguieron todo el apoyo de las altas esferas políticas en Washington, lo
cual convirtió un incidente lamentable en la mayor derrota sufrida por la
marina de Estados Unidos desde la Segunda Guerra, costándole la carrera a
docenas de distinguidos oficiales a quienes ni siquiera se les comprobó
haber tomado parte en la fiesta.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Una de las víctimas de Tailhook fue el antecesor del almirante Boorda, a
quién se obligó a adelantar su jubilación. Se trató de una cacería de
brujas, donde los condenados no tuvieron la oportunidad de defenderse y la
hoja de servicio de valientes oficiales que dieron los mejores años de su
vida a la defensa de la patria fue emborronada y destruida por las fuerzas
predominantes de la "política correcta", para quienes ser homosexual es "un
estilo de vida", pero silbarle a una mujer bonita es imperdonable.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dos de los hijos y una nuera del almirante Boorda son oficiales navales.
John Lehman, Secretario de la Naval en tiempos de Reagan, mantiene que Mike
Boorda fue "acorralado y linchado por una turba". Lo preocupante es que
muchos de aquellos sucios y melenudos pacifistas de los años 60 hoy tienen
cargos claves en el gobierno del presidente Bill Clinton, quien en su
juventud presumía de "odiar" a los militares. Según Lehman, los que hasta
hace unos días difamaban al almirante Boorda son los mismos que antes
alababan la economía soviética, culpaban a Estados Unidos de la Guerra Fría
y despotricaban contra los esfuerzos del presidente Reagan en construir la
armada más efectiva y poderosa de la historia de la humanidad, capaz de
mantener la paz.&copy;<p>

<h2>
BENEFICENCIA CORPORATIVA
</h2>     
     
     
Carlos Ball*
<p>

MIAMI <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- En América Latina no nos sorprende encontrar a empresarios
que defienden fervientemente la economía de mercado, siempre y cuando no se
aplique a sus negocios; pero sí  exigen todas las ventajas y todos los
privilegios que tradicionalmente han recibido de sus contactos políticos.
Pues resulta que en la gran democracia del norte la forma es algo más
circunspecta, pero el fondo es muy parecido.
<dd>	El gobierno de Estados Unidos gasta $75.000 millones en subsidiar a
empresas privadas a través de 125 programas federales diferentes. El gran
debate político sobre la necesidad de equilibrar el presupuesto se ha
concentrado en examinar programas sociales que han crecido a una velocidad
de varias veces el aumento poblacional y de la inflación, pero poco se habla
de la beneficencia corporativa, cuando su eliminación reduciría a la mitad
el déficit fiscal.
<dd>	La beneficencia corporativa se puede definir como la concesión de favores y
beneficios, por parte del gobierno, a empresas específicas y, al igual de lo
que sucede en América Latina, los beneficiarios no suelen ser firmas
diminutas que tratan de sobrevivir sino muchas de las más grandes y
poderosas. La beneficencia corporativa tiene múltiples formas:
transferencias directas de fondos, préstamos blandos (a tasas subsidiadas de
interés y a largo plazo), seguro de inversiones y de exportaciones a países
riesgosos, subsidios, barreras a importaciones para proteger ciertas
industrias que de otra forma no podrían competir (aumentándole el costo de
esos productos y servicios a los estadounidenses), ventajas impositivas (con
reducción de impuestos o aceleración de la depreciación permitida), etc.
<dd>	El ambiente de corrupción generado por la beneficencia corporativa es parte
integral del mal. Ha sido comprobado que muchas de las empresas beneficiadas
por programas tales como el de Tecnología Avanzada y el Programa de
Reinversión Tecnológica fueron también las que aportaron las más grandes
contribuciones a la campaña electoral del presidente Clinton. Otras
empresas, como Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) aporta millones de dólares en
contribuciones a candidatos de ambos partidos políticos y tales
contribuciones han coincidido con subsidios a ADM por valor de cientos de
millones de dólares en los últimos 25 años. Hay algo indudablemente podrido
cuando los impuestos pagados por ciudadanos comunes se canalizan para
aumentar las ganancias empresariales.
<dd>	De esta manera el gobierno premia no a las empresas que mejor sirven al
consumidor sino a las que son más hábiles en el campo político. Una relación
descriptiva de la beneficencia corporativa estadounidense no cabría en la
edición de hoy de este periódico. Entre las joyas: El programa azucarero
concede más de un millón de dólares al año a cada una de las 33 plantaciones
más grandes de azúcar, a la vez que duplica el costo interno del azúcar. El
Programa de Promoción de Mercado del Departamento de Agricultura  ha pagado
más de $50 millones en publicidad en el extranjero de los vinos de
California. El Programa de Tecnología Avanzada le da casi $500 millones
anuales a empresas como Xerox, Caterpillar y General Electric como subsidio
a sus investigaciones y desarrollo de nuevos productos. La agencia de
Inversiones Privadas en Ultramar gasta $58 millones al año asegurando las
exportaciones e inversiones en el exterior de empresas como Coca Cola y
General Electric.
<dd>	El centro neurálgico de la beneficencia corporativa en este país es el
Departamento de Comercio, un ministerio que muchos jóvenes congresistas
quieren eliminar. También importante es el Departamento de Agricultura,
ministerio cuyo personal ha crecido geométricamente a medida de que se
reduce el número de agricultores en el país. El problema es que cuando esos
mismos jóvenes congresistas aspiren a ser reelegidos, los más dispuestos a
aportar fondos a sus campañas serán las mismas empresas y grupos de presión
que reciben el grueso de los beneficios magnánimamente concedidos por el
gobierno. Nada nuevo bajo el Sol. &copy

<h2>POLITIZACION Y CORRUPCION DE LA JUSTICIA
</h2>     
     
     
Carlos Ball*
<p>

MIAMI <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- De todas las plagas que han acosado a América Latina en los
últimos años, la más funesta ha sido la creciente politización de nuestros
sistemas judiciales, lo cual a su vez ha fomentado la corrupción. Si la ley
no es respetable, no se acata y surge el caos.
<dd>	Es un fenómeno regional que a medida que nuestros países se fueron
democratizando, mientras los dictadores y caudillos iban siendo desplazados
por gobiernos democráticamente electos, el nombramiento de jueces comenzó a
hacerse en función de afiliaciones y tendencias partidistas, lo cual al
transcurrir de los años se ha degenerado en el desprestigio de la
institución y su exposición a la manipulación política o a la descarada
venta de fallos y sentencias al mejor postor.
<dd>	Otra influencia extraordinariamente negativa es que las más poderosas
multinacionales que operan hoy en América Latina no son ya las viejas United
Fruit y Standard Oil Company sino los carteles del narcotráfico. Y gracias a
la política de Washington de declarar la guerra a la fabricación y al
transporte más que al consumo de las drogas, el campo de batalla fue
trasladado a nuestros países, donde el sueldo mensual de un policía o de un
juez equivale a lo que gana diariamente un vendedor al detal de drogas en
las calles de Nueva York o Los Angeles.
<dd>	Sin seguridad jurídica no puede florecer la inversión ni la creación de
empleos. La apertura económica en países como México, Venezuela y hasta
cierto punto Argentina, donde las privatizaciones beneficiaron
principalmente a aquellos cercanos al poder, no genera la prosperidad
general y altos niveles de empleo que rápidamente se traducen en apoyo
electoral a las reformas económicas. Por el contrario, surgen violentas
oleadas contra el mal llamado neoliberalismo que en su versión
latinoamericana tiende sólo a beneficiar a elites políticas y empresariales,
al terminar pagando el pueblo más por los bienes y servicios de las viejas
empresas estatales ahora convertidas en monopolios privados, mientras el
producto de las privatizaciones se aplica a mantener burocracias excesivas,
a campañas electorales y a cuentas particulares de los gobernantes y sus
familiares en el extranjero.
<dd>	En Venezuela se desató una cínica persecución política contra los banqueros
"prófugos" de la justicia. Entre ellos hay unos cuantos gángsters bien
conocidos, pero también entre esos 400 que les han dictado autos de
detención hay muchos que no eran responsables, cometieron pecados veniales o
equivocaciones, pero que obviamente no tienen ninguna fe en un proceso
judicial totalmente politizado. Todos fueron metidos en la misma canasta
ante la desesperación del gobierno de Caldera de encontrar culpables de la
debacle venezolana y en su campaña por desprestigiar al "capitalismo" y la
reforma económica iniciada por Carlos Andrés Pérez.
<dd>	Por otra parte, me contaba recientemente un alto ejecutivo de una
multinacional en Buenos Aires, quien antes ocupó una posición similar en
Caracas, que la corrupción del sector privado en la Argentina está mucho más
generalizada que en Venezuela porque para cerrar ventas importantes a otras
empresas hay que pagarles comisiones a los gerentes de compras. Es decir, el
sector privado allá ya fue contagiado por las prácticas del sector público.
<dd>	La trascendencia del Imperio de la Ley y de la seguridad jurídica la expuso
F. W. Maitland hace más de un siglo al escribir: "El ejercicio del poder en
forma imprevisible origina alguna de las mayores limitaciones, pues la
limitación, cuanto menos previsible, es mayor y más temida. Nos sentimos
menos libres cuando sabemos que en cualquier momento y sobre cualquiera de
nuestras acciones puede recaer una limitación, y, sin embargo, no podemos
prever tales limitaciones Las reglas conocidas, por muy malas que sean,
interfieren menos con la libertad que las decisiones basadas en reglas que
no son previamente conocidas". 
<dd>	Cuando las decisiones judiciales y la interpretación de las leyes se hacen
en función de los intereses políticos del momento, la supuesta libertad
política se convierte en un gran engaño y la gente comienza a echar de menos
los mejores tiempos que se vivían bajo algún autócrata, cuando al menos
estaba claro lo que se podía o no hacer y el círculo de privilegios era
mucho más reducido. &copy

<TITLE>Ball: Por Fin Arranca Dole -- 8/7/96</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>POR FIN ARRANCA DOLE</H2>
Carlos A. Ball*<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El 5 de agosto en Chicago, el candidato republicano Bob Dole
comenzó su discurso anunciando su plan de crecimiento económico de la
siguiente forma: "Es estupendo estar aquí. Estupendo poder dar este discurso
antes que Bill Clinton obtenga una copia y trate de darlo él". Clara manera
de decir que desde que comenzó la campaña el presidente Clinton, con
habilidad de camaleón, se ha apoderado de una tras otra bandera republicana.
<dd>	
La más importantes de esas banderas hasta la fecha había sido la reforma de
la beneficencia pública, ante el fracaso de una billonaria política que
lejos de sacar de la pobreza a los más desdichados ha institucionalizado la
dependencia, creando consecutivas generaciones de personas que no trabajan y
de niñas solteras teniendo hijos. La decisión de traspasar el dinero y la
responsabilidad a los estados, a la vez de la imposición de un límite máximo
de por vida de cinco años en la dependencia de la caridad pública significa
la aceptación de una doctrina antagónica a la filosofía de la izquierda
estadounidense, hasta ahora consentida por la administración Clinton. Es
más, al presidente anunciar que no vetaría -como antes lo hizo- la reforma
de la beneficencia propuesta por los republicanos, ello motivó a muchos
congresistas demócratas a apoyarla también, conscientes de la proximidad de
elecciones legislativas en noviembre y de que el país entero se ha movido a
la derecha.
<dd>	
En su discurso, Dole agarró y corrió con la bandera que mejor define a los
republicanos: bajos impuestos como camino hacia un gobierno más pequeño y
limitado. Continuó diciendo: "este es un discurso que Bill Clinton jamás
podrá dar". Y resumió su programa así:<ul>
<li>Equilibrar el presupuesto.
<li>Reducirle el peso de los impuestos a la clase media.
<li>Proveer nuevas oportunidades educativas a los americanos.
<li>Reformar el sistema fracturado de litigios y demandas.
<li>Acabar con regulaciones federales innecesarias.
<li>Y restaurar la promesa del sueño americano.
</ul><dd>	
Dole dijo que los americanos son corredores olímpicos con un peso de 50
libras en las piernas y ya es tiempo de deshacernos de cadenas y grilletes,
haciendo referencia a las múltiples ataduras impuestas por el gobierno.
Según Dole, la "clintoeconomía" ha aplastado la clase media con altos
impuestos y bajo crecimiento.
<dd>	
Así como en América Latina los políticos tratan de ganarse a los pobres,
que son mayoría, en este país el grueso del voto está en la clase media y
las estadísticas favorecen a Dole porque desde que Clinton ocupa la Casa
Blanca los ingresos del gobierno federal han aumentado en $322.000 millones
(29%) y la recaudación de impuestos federales por cada persona aumentó a
$5.365 o 25% desde 1992. En ese mismo período el ingreso por trabajador
aumentó sólo en 10%. Dole afirma que es "increíble que la familia ahora
gasta más en impuestos que en el total por alimentos, ropa y vivienda".
<dd>	
Las medidas concretas que propone incluyen una reducción general de 15% (en
tres años) en las tasas de impuesto personal. Un crédito fiscal de $500 por
cada niño menor de 18 años. Reducción de 50% del impuesto de ganancias de
capital (de 28% a 14%) para motivar la reinversión en las pequeñas empresas
que aportan tres de cada cuatro nuevos empleos. Ampliación de las cuentas
individuales de pensiones, libres de impuestos para que la gente ahorre más.
Y, por último, insistirá que el Congreso imponga una super mayoría de 60%
para cualquier futuro aumento de impuestos.
<dd>
Promete no descansar hasta que todo el sistema impositivo sea reemplazado
por uno más simple, más justo y más plano. Dole dijo que hoy la  opresiva
oficina del impuesto es el doble de grande que la CIA y cinco veces más
grande que el FBI. Cumplir con las leyes impositivas requiere el trabajo a
tiempo completo de casi tres millones de personas, más que todos los
miembros de las fuerzas armadas. "Soy optimista, creo que los funcionarios
del impuesto pueden ser entrenados para que hagan cosas provechosas... y
comenzaré pasando la carga de las pruebas a los fiscales para de nuevo
presumir la inocencia de los ciudadanos hasta que se compruebe lo contrario…
acabaré con las auditorías tipo KGB… mi administración liberará a los
americanos de la tiranía de los impuestos… el objetivo es crear un
crecimiento económico de 3,5% o más al año y la historia muestra que los
recortes de impuestos estimulan el crecimiento y aumentan la recaudación".
Dole terminó su discurso citando a Winston Churchill, pero oigo más bien un
eco de las  propuestas de Steve Forbes, a quien duramente combatió en las
primarias.
<dd>
Es difícil confiar en los políticos y los de Estados Unidos no son muy
diferentes. Bush prometió no aumentar los impuestos y Clinton prometió
rebajarlos. Ninguno de los dos cumplió su palabra. Pero indudablemente que
Bob Dole por fin ha logrado obtener la atención del electorado; la campaña
se vuelve interesante y más importante aún que el nombramiento del candidato
republicano a la vicepresidencia sería que se designara a Steve Forbes como
secretario del Tesoro. Pase lo que pase fue él quien colocó a los impuestos
en el tapete. ©<p>

<TITLE>Ball: Jack Kemp -- 9/04/96</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>September 04, 1996</i><br>
<H2>JACK KEMP</H2>
Carlos A. Ball*<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- A mis años pensaba que ya no me entusiasmaría ningún político
y menos una campaña presidencial. Pero he tenido dos sorpresas en 1996.
Primero con Steve Forbes y ahora con la candidatura de Jack Kemp a la
vicepresidencia, la cual ha mejorado radicalmente las probabilidades de que
Bob Dole sea el próximo ocupante de la Casa Blanca.<p>
	Cuando oigo hablar a los políticos, siempre me pregunto ¿en qué me están
tratando de engañar? Kemp y media docena de otros, como John McCain y Dick
Armey, son las excepciones. Kemp habla con el corazón y mirando a los ojos.
Cuando en medio de la Convención Republicana en San Diego abrazó y besó a su
hijo -quien lo presentó-, parecía que estábamos viendo a un padre latino
besando a su hijo de mediana edad en público.<p>
	En enero de 1995, Kemp anunció que no buscaría la nominación presidencial
de su partido para las elecciones de 1996. Las nuevas reglas de
financiamiento electoral obligan a los candidatos a dedicarse de lleno a
conseguir decenas de miles de pequeños contribuyentes, algo que le
disgustaba y, además, todavía estaba pagando las deudas incurridas en su
anterior intento. Dos meses más tarde, en marzo de 1995, fue nombrado por
Bob Dole y Newt Gingrich presidente de la Comisión Nacional sobre
Crecimiento Económico y Reforma Impositiva para estudiar la mejor manera de
reestructurar el sistema de impuestos, del cual todo el mundo se queja y que
ha sido no sólo la principal fuente de corrupción política sino el mayor
freno a la prosperidad y al crecimiento.<p>
	Jack Kemp no es el único político estadounidense consciente de la necesidad
de retomar el camino del crecimiento económico para que "la marea" levante
el nivel de vida de todos los ciudadanos, como sucedió aquí en los años 50,
60 y 80. Pero Kemp sí es el único de ese grupo que es percibido por la
generalidad de los votantes como alguien realmente preocupado por los
pobres, por los habitantes de los barrios, por los inmigrantes y las minorías.<p>
	Hay cierto aire artificial cuando algunos de los principales líderes del
Partido Republicano se acercan a las comunidades latinas de Los Angeles y
Chicago o a los barrios negros de Detroit y Miami. Eso no sucede con Kemp.
El no está allí por ganar puntos; sinceramente está en activa búsqueda de la
mejor manera de resolver los problemas que confrontan los más débiles de la
sociedad. Como Secretario de Vivienda y Desarrollo Urbano, bajo Bush,
introdujo el concepto de las Zonas Emprendedoras para promover -con bajos
impuestos- la creación de empresas y de empleos en los barrios pobres de las
grandes ciudades, a la vez que fomentaba el traspaso de la propiedad de
apartamentos de los proyectos residenciales del gobierno a manos de los
inquilinos, sabiendo que al convertirlos en propietarios de su vivienda
adquirían la dignidad y confianza conducentes a romper las cadenas de la
dependencia en la beneficencia pública.<p>
	Sobre la inmigración, Kemp dijo el 18 de febrero de este año: "Tenemos que
comprender que estamos obteniendo algunos de los mejores y más brillantes
cerebros de todo el mundo para que inviertan sus talentos en la economía
estadounidense. Nos estamos volviendo más competitivos y más prósperos… y,
en el proceso, no estamos desplazando ni devaluando a trabajadores americanos".<p>
	Luego de una casi total concentración del esfuerzo de los republicanos en
equilibrar el presupuesto federal, lo cual es importante pero no enciende el
entusiasmo de los electores, Kemp (y su discípulo Forbes) argumentaron que
el déficit es la consecuencia de un mal mayor. No podemos conformarnos con
los actuales niveles mediocres de crecimiento económico, 2 a 2,5% anual,
cuando a raíz de las rebajas de impuestos de Kennedy, el crecimiento entre
1960 y 1964 alcanzó 4,7% anual, y luego de las rebajas impositivas de
Reagan, el crecimiento anual promedió 3,1% de 1981 a 1988. <p>
	Kemp aspira que el Plan Dole, al cual tanto él como Gary Becker
contribuyeron, conduzca a un crecimiento de 3,5%, lo cual doblaría el tamaño
de la economía de Estados Unidos para el año 2008.<p>
	En sus propias palabras: "La inmensa burocracia gubernamental que
soportamos fue creada durante los últimos 60 años con buenas intenciones,
pero con una filosofía redistributiva que condujo a resultados
contraproducentes. Dando la cara a esa realidad, los republicanos cometemos
un grave error cuando tratamos de ahorrar primero en los programas sociales.
Eso permite que se nos acuse de poner la carreta de la austeridad fiscal
antes que el caballo de crecimiento económico rápido".<p>
	Kemp, además, tiene una visión mundial que ha brillado por su ausencia bajo
Clinton y Gore, quienes han tratado de pasar responsabilidades y liderazgo a
las Naciones Unidas, con consecuencias lamentables. Luego de la Primera
Guerra, Estados Unidos le dio la espalda al mundo y sus leyes
proteccionistas aunadas a políticas monetarias constrictivas convirtieron
una recesión en la Gran Depresión que no terminó sino con la Segunda Guerra.
Luego de esta última predominó la apertura al mundo y la expansión económica
que condujo al triunfo en la Guerra Fría. Cuatro años más de Clinton, con su
desidia hacia todo lo extranjero, podría repetir los dolorosos sucesos de
los años 30 y terminar de enterrar la visión de Reagan y Bush sobre un
continente americano integrado económicamente, bajo un floreciente
capitalismo democrático.<p>
	Aquellos que menosprecian la posición de la vicepresidencia no ven que ella
colocaría a Jack Kemp en el lugar clave para aspirar a la presidencia en el
año 2000, lo cual me convierte en optimista acerca del nuevo milenio. ©<p>

<TITLE>LA VIENA DE MISES Y HAYEK -- 10/09/96</TITLE>

<i>October 09, 1996</i><br>
<H2>LA VIENA DE MISES Y HAYEK</H2>
Carlos A. Ball*<br>
<p>
VIENA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--  Mi anterior viaje a Viena fue en 1968, cuando los venezolanos
viajábamos con una moneda dura por todo el mundo. Entonces me hospedé en el
Hotel Imperial, quizá el más bello de todos los hoteles clásicos europeos,
donde uno abre los ojos por la mañana admirando increíbles frescos en el
techo de la habitación y se tira de un cordón detrás de la cama para que a
los pocos segundos aparezca un mesonero de levita preguntando qué apetece
para el desayuno.
<P>
 Los rusos ocuparon a Austria hasta 1955, pero esta capital del viejo
imperio no ha logrado despertar de un largo letargo socialista que sigue
predominando junto al frío y húmedo otoño. Se trata de un socialismo menos
ineficiente que los del Caribe: el tranvía que tomo cada mañana para asistir
a las conferencias de la Sociedad Mont Pèlerin (fundada por Hayek hace 49
años) funciona con limpieza y precisión alemana, y jamás me han pedido el
boleto porque las autoridades asumen que lo compré. Me imagino que el pasaje
está altamente subsidiado porque con 20 chelines austríacos -unos dos
dólares americanos- puedo hacer todos los viajes que quiera durante un día.
Por el contrario, tomarse un café o comerse una deliciosa torta de chocolate
es una inversión que amerita cierta reflexión previa. Además, cualquier cosa
que uno coma lleva un impuesto de 10% y lo que se bebe 20%.
<P> 
Los economistas que miden el nivel de vida de los pueblos le asignan los
primeros puestos al Japón, Suiza y Alemania sin tomar en cuenta los precios.
El japonés de clase media vive en un apartamento poco más grande que el
clóset de un hogar americano y la ama de casa alemana tiene que comprar
alimentos todos los días porque su nevera es más o menos del tamaño del
televisor que ocupa un lugar de honor en el "family room" estadounidense.
 Mi impresión de Viena se repite: una gran capital sin mucho país para
sostenerla; edificaciones más fastuosas que las de París o Londres, pero
donde predomina una triste nostalgia por el irrepetible esplendor de fines
del siglo XIX, algo no padecido con la misma intensidad en otras capitales
de viejos imperios. Me quedé en casa de un pariente noble de amigos
argentinos, el palacio del príncipe Kinsky, una impresionante mansión
barroca del siglo XVIII en el centro de la ciudad, lo cual por unos días me
ha permitido asomarme a esa esplendorosa época que terminó con el retumbar
de los cañones, en agosto de 1914.
<P>
 Con Carl Menger nació en Viena, en 1871, la economía moderna o neoclásica.
Fue el fundador de la escuela austríaca, seguido por su brillante discípulo
Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk en la cátedra de economía de la Universidad de Viena.
El rostro de Böhm-Bawerk ilustra hoy los billetes de cien chelines. Estos
economistas austríacos centraron sus investigaciones en las motivaciones del
individuo y en la forma cómo este actúa en reacción a sus propias
motivaciones, preferencias y valoraciones. Esas preferencias del consumidor
a su vez impulsan y ordenan la actividad productora de bienes y servicios,
conduciendo a los inversionistas hacia la óptima utilización de los
recursos. También concluyeron que gastos en mano de obra y materiales no
confieren valor a los productos y servicios, sino que su valor procede
exclusivamente de las apreciaciones del consumidor. 
<P>
Estos economistas vieneses se dieron cuenta que cuanto mayor es la cantidad
de un producto menor es el valor que se le atribuye a cada unidad. Por ello
el agua y el pan son baratos, mientras que el oro y los brillantes son caros. 
 Ludwig von Mises ingresó al seminario de Böhm-Bawerk en el año 1900 y luego
procedió a avanzar la teoría económica indicando que el "precio" del dinero
(su poder adquisitivo) es determinado por el mercado en la misma forma que
se determina el precio de cualquier otro bien, en función de la cantidad
disponible. La gente gasta rápidamente cualquier moneda que pierde su valor
y ahorra en otra moneda que lo mantiene.
<P> 
Una estupenda anécdota de Mises se refiere a la consulta que le hicieron
durante la violenta inflación que sobrevino en Austria luego de la Primera
Guerra. Cuando le preguntaron cómo remediarla, Mises insistió que se
encontraran con él a la medianoche en una calle de Viena. A esa hora y
rodeado de altos funcionarios dijo: "¿oyen ese ruido?... es la imprenta del
Banco Central imprimiendo billetes... párenla".
<P> 
No conocí a Mises, pero sí a su alumno Friedrich A. von Hayek y en esta
visita a Viena conversé con su hijo Laurence y su nuera Esca. No voy a
tratar de describir la obra de Hayek en un párrafo pero si algo lo definió
fue su fiel creencia en el poder de las ideas, lo cual caracteriza al
liberalismo mismo. Hayek mantenía que lo que está conscientemente presente
en la mente de un hombre es apenas una diminuta parte de las ideas en que
basa su manera de pensar, de lo cual surge lo que llamó "el orden
espontáneo" que es la consecuencia imprevista del accionar independiente de
millones de individuos. En sus propias palabras: "sería un error  creer que
para alcanzar un grado más alto de civilización tenemos simplemente que
instrumentar las ideas que ahora nos guían. Si vamos a avanzar, tenemos que
dejar espacio a una continua revisión de nuestros actuales conceptos e
ideales…".
<P> 
Los palacios, museos, monumentos y estatuas de Viena nos recuerdan las
batallas y glorias del pasado, pero son Mises y Hayek quienes representan la
victoria de las ideas liberales en nuestro siglo, triunfantes frente al
cruel socialismo estatista y la empobrecedora planificación central. Para mi
son ellos el más grandioso legado de Viena. &copy;

<title>LOS PREMIOS NOBEL 1996 DE ECONOMIA -- 11/14/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>LOS PREMIOS NOBEL 1996 DE ECONOMIA
</h2>
Carlos A. Ball*<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Un taciturno economista escocés de 60 años -James Mirrless-,
profesor de la Universidad de Cambridge y otro de 82 años -William Vickrey-,
profesor emérito de la Universidad de Columbia, quienes nunca se conocieron,
fueron conjuntamente los ganadores este año del Premio Nobel de economía.
Vickrey, el primer canadiense que lo gana, murió el viernes 11 de octubre de
un infarto, apenas tres días después de haber sido anunciado su galardón.
<p>
El premio, que conlleva una bolsa de $1,120.000, fue concedido por la Real
Academia Sueca de las Ciencias por el trabajo pionero de ambos en el
desarrollo "de la teoría económica de incentivos bajo información
asimétrica". Esto, que suena muy complicado, tiene que ver con las
decisiones económicas que se toman cuando las partes no tienen la misma
información. Por ejemplo, cuando alguien pide prestado al banco, esa persona
conoce mucho mejor su habilidad de pagar el crédito que el banquero que
decidirá prestar o no. También, quien compra una póliza de vida sabe más de
su propia salud que la empresa de seguro.
<p>
Esta asimetría de información tiene como consecuencia que el que más sabe
aprovecha para explotar estratégicamente su mayor conocimiento. La
investigación sobre la economía de la información se ha concentrado en
generar una mayor comprensión de los mercados de seguros, de créditos, las
subastas, los sistemas de impuestos, las instituciones políticas, etc. 
<p>
Ambos economistas han hecho importantes contribuciones al estudio de los
impuestos, buscando que las recaudaciones distorsionen lo menos posible los
incentivos al trabajo y al ahorro. El profesor Mirrlees, quien fue asesor
del Partido Laborista inglés, favorecía la redistribución de la riqueza, a
través del sistema impositivo. En 1971, cuando la tasa tope del impuesto
inglés era 83%, con la ayuda de un complejo modelo matemático se propuso
identificar una tasa impositiva óptima que maximizara la productividad y el
esfuerzo de la gente. Mirrless no sólo encontró que la tasa impositiva
debería ser 20% sino que esa debería ser aplicada por igual a todo el mundo.
El primer sorprendido fue él mismo, declarando: "Debo confesar que esperaba
que un riguroso análisis del impuesto sobre la renta en forma utilitaria me
daría argumentos en apoyo de altas tasas impositivas. Pero no ha sido así".
<p>
Vickrey, por su parte, mantenía que los impuestos no deberían desincentivar
a la gente en  producir un dólar adicional de ganancia porque si dejan de
hacerlo el gobierno no recaudará ningún impuesto sobre ese dólar de riqueza
que nunca se llegó a producir.
<p>
En 1964, Vickrey escribió: "Sigue siendo un hecho que las ganancias
producidas por el trabajo están sujetas al impuesto sobre la renta, mientras
que el beneficio personal obtenido por el disfrute del tiempo libre no es
pechado… Por ello, el impuesto sobre la renta tiende a hacer que los
individuos prefieran descansar…" Vickrey decía que sus ideas respecto al
impuesto no fueron aplicadas porque hubieran dejado desempleada a la
burocracia de la oficina del impuesto.
<p>
Vickrey, en los años 1962 y 63, trabajó en la planificación urbana y
sistemas de transporte de la India, Argentina y Venezuela, haciendo
importantes contribuciones al mejor uso de recursos escasos, para lo cual es
necesario fijar un precio, ya que lo que nada cuesta se malgasta. Muchos
servicios como las carreteras, el transporte colectivo y la electricidad
requieren inmensas inversiones iniciales y cobrar lo mismo en las horas pico
crea congestión. Respecto a carreteras y puentes sugirió que el peaje fuese
más caro durante las horas pico, de manera de desestimular el uso de esas
vías por personas que no tienen la necesidad de utilizarlas a esas horas. A
medida que aumenta la competencia en el servicio eléctrico, los usuarios se
benefician gastando electricidad en horas en que es más barata y las
empresas eléctricas se benefician con un consumo más estable, lo cual
aumenta la eficiencia de sus plantas.
<p>
Los amigos de Mirrlees cuentan que su única pasión fuera de la economía y
la matemática son las novelas de detectives. Y Vickrey, quien ni siquiera
sabía exactamente cuánto ganaba como profesor en Columbia, donde enseñó
durante medio siglo, dijo que no necesitaba el dinero pero sí la tribuna que
el Premio Nobel le daría. Lamentablemente, sufrió un ataque al corazón
mientras manejaba de Nueva York a Boston. ©

NUNCA ANTES PAGAMOS MAS  EN IMPUESTOS

WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Según los últimos datos del Departamento de Comercio, el
inexorable crecimiento de los impuestos bajo Bill Clinton ha alcanzado un
nuevo pináculo. Para el segundo trimestre de 1996, los impuestos federales
como porcentaje del PIB han alcanzado su nivel histórico más alto. El
gobierno federal le sacó del bolsillo a los estadounidenses $1.572.500
millones, mientras que el PIB fue de $7.547.600 millones. Eso coloca los
impuestos en 20,8% del PIB.
<P>
 Para asegurarme de que los impuestos federales nunca habían sido tan altos,
calculé las contribuciones como porcentaje del PIB desde que existe esa
información. Las cifras del PIB anual van hasta 1929 y la información
trimestral desde 1946 hasta hoy. En todo ese tiempo, sólo durante cuatro
años los ingresos del gobierno federal alcanzaron 20,5% del PIB, y durante
tres de esos cuatro años estábamos en guerra.
<P>
 Los impuestos federales alcanzaron 20,5% del PIB en 1943, en medio de la
Segunda Guerra Mundial. Llegaron a 20,6% en el primer trimestre de 1951,
durante la guerra de Corea y a 20,7% en el segundo trimestre de 1969, cuando
el recargo tributario de la Guerra de Vietnam estaba vigente. La ocasión
anterior en que los impuestos estuvieron casi tan altos como actualmente
bajo Clinton fue durante la primera mitad del año 1981, alcanzando 20,7% del
PIB, debido a que la inflación de dos dígitos sufrida durante la
administración del presidente Carter elevó a la gente a tramos superiores
del impuesto sobre la renta.
<P>
 Así vemos que en ningún período anterior el gobierno federal agarró tanto
en impuestos como hoy lo hace Bill Clinton.
<P>
 Tanto el Departamento del Tesoro como la Oficina Presupuestaria del
Congreso creen que las cifras del segundo semestre son una aberración
resultante posiblemente de pagos por ganancias de capital más altas de lo
esperado, por la subida de la Bolsa de Valores. Sin embargo, el actual nivel
de contribuciones es consistente con la creciente tendencia experimentada
desde que Clinton llegó a la Casa Blanca y nos encasquetó el aumento
impositivo más grande de la historia de Estados Unidos.
<P>
 Algunos grupos, como los izquierdistas del Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, argumentan que los impuestos que pagan los individuos no han
subido porque los ingresos adicionales provienen de impuestos corporativos y
de aumentos en las primas de Medicare (el seguro estatal para los ancianos).
Eso es una ingenuidad. Los impuestos corporativos los termina pagando la
gente a través de salarios más bajos, precios más altos o dividendos
inferiores. Y mayores primas de Medicare reducen el ingreso disponible de la
misma forma como lo hacen impuestos más altos. Por lo tanto, la proporción
de los impuestos en el PIB sigue siendo la mejor medida de la carga fiscal. &copy;

LA LIBERTAD ECONOMICA ESTIMULA EL CRECIMIENTO

Gary S. Becker*

<P>
CHICAGO (AIPE).- El colapso del comunismo y el éxito  de los Tigres del
Asia estimularon un movimiento mundial hacia la privatización y la
desregulación, ya que estos sucesos parecen indicar que la libertad
económica es mucho más efectiva que el control gubernamental en promover el
crecimiento. Los revisionistas han cuestionado tal conclusión, pero esta
recibió un resonante apoyo de parte de un importante estudio publicado por
tres economistas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La obra Libertad Económica en el Mundo utiliza 17 clasificaciones para
evaluar el grado de libertad en los últimos 20 años en más de 100 países.
Los autores estimaron la restricción a transacciones internacionales en
bienes y flujos de capital, los controles de precios, la incidencia de
empresas estatales, la importancia de subsidios y transferencias
gubernamentales, los niveles de impuestos, la libertad de mantener fondos en
el extranjero y la inflación. Estos factores fueron, a la vez, combinados en
índices de libertad económica que clasifican a las naciones y muestran los
cambios registrados desde 1975.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Estos índices aportan la más convincente evidencia de que las naciones no
crecen sin considerable libertad económica. El producto bruto per cápita de
las 10 naciones con más libertad económica aumentó en promedio a razón de
2,3% por año entre 1980 y 1984, comparado con un miserable crecimiento de
1,3% en los 27 países menos libres. Mientras más libertad, mayor tendencia a
un rápido crecimiento.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El ingreso real per cápita tiende también a ser mucho más alto en los
países con mayor libertad económica. La media docena de países más libres
gozan de varias veces el ingreso per cápita de aquellos clasificados en el
medio y de más de 20 veces que los menos libres. Se  muestra porqué muchos
de los países africanos ocupan las últimas 20 posiciones. Los apologistas
culpan a la dominación colonial por el mal expediente de Africa, pero esa no
es la razón principal. Por el contrario, luego de la independencia muchas
naciones africanas imitaron el camino errado de los países comunistas y
socialistas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Como muchas naciones mantuvieron una clasificación de libertad estable en
los últimos 20 años, los resultados de aquellos que abrieron sus economías
son especialmente ilustrativos. La producción de los 10 países con el mayor
crecimiento de libertad económica alcanzó un crecimiento promedio de 2,7%
entre 1980 y 1994, mientras que las que más restringieron la libertad
económica sufrieron un crecimiento negativo. Chile, Portugal, Paquistán y
Mauritania, los cuatro países en desarrollo con mayor aumento de libertad
económica, crecieron mucho más que los cuatro países en desarrollo que
sufrieron aumentos en la intervención gubernamental: Honduras, Irán,
Nicaragua y Venezuela.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Un creciente número de economistas niegan que el rápido crecimiento de las
economías asiáticas comprueban la importancia de la libertad económica,
indicando que sus gobiernos dirigen la actividad económica. Indican que
Corea utilizó a los bancos estatales para aportar capital subsidiado a las
grandes empresas, que Taiwan controlaba las importaciones y los mercados
financieros, y que Singapur subsidiaba las inversiones extranjeras.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Sin embargo, estos nuevos índices confirman que a pesar de tales
intervenciones, las economías en Asia han sido mucho más libres que en otras
partes. Ocupan los primeros puestos en la clasificación: Hong Kong es N° 1,
Singapur N° 3 y Japón N°10. Aún Taiwan y Corea del Sur (números 16 y 20)
gozan de libertad de comercio comparados con el resto del mundo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lamentablemente, los políticos pocas veces están dispuestos a tomar
medidas impopulares en la reducción de la intervención gubernamental. A
pesar de las altas tasas de desempleo en Europa occidental, países como
Francia y Alemania han hecho muy poco por desregular, aparentemente porque
temen la reacción de los electores.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Este nuevo estudio aporta evidencias persuasivas de que la libertad
económica es esencial para el crecimiento económico. Ciertos países sufren
innecesariamente porque no se permite el florecimiento de su energía e
imaginación, en un ambiente de libertad.

<TITLE>Becker: Hay que Imponer Limites al Gasto Gubernamental -- 8/7/96
</TITLE>

<H2>HAY QUE IMPONER LIMITES AL GASTO GUBERNAMENTAL</H2>
Gary S. Becker*<p>
CHICAGO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- No es ningún secreto que el sistema impositivo de Estados
Unidos es complejo y acosado por altas tasas. El nivel actual de los
impuestos reduce el crecimiento  y la eficiencia económica al desviar
recursos productivos hacia esfuerzos por evitarlos y evadirlos. Por lo tanto
un sistema más simple y más parejo haría una gran diferencia. Pero para ser
efectiva, una reforma de los impuestos tendría que estar acompañada de
medidas que desalienten el crecimiento del gasto gubernamental.
<dd>	
Cuando se calculan los resultados de una simplificación de los impuestos y
de reducir las tasas, a menudo se asume que el gasto gubernamental es
independiente del sistema impositivo. Recientemente, cuando el Wall Street
Journal preguntó a 12 economistas lo que pensaban de la tasa única de
impuestos, todos la apoyaron, pero apenas unos pocos mencionamos el efecto
que tendría en los gastos gubernamentales.
<dd>	
El proceso político de las democracias virtualmente garantiza que el gasto
gubernamental dependa de la estructura impositiva. La mayoría de los grupos
de presión tienen deseos insaciables de favores gubernamentales. El único
freno a sus pretensiones es la resistencia de los contribuyentes. Si se
debilita esa resistencia a través de una reforma impositiva que reduce el
costo de cumplimiento y los efectos perniciosos contra el ahorro y el
esfuerzo personal, el gasto gubernamental tenderá a aumentar. Mayores gastos
gubernamentales causarán más daño que el beneficio obtenido por la reforma
impositiva.
<dd>	
El argumento que la resistencia contra impuestos más altos es mayor cuando
la carga es más pesada y más transparente se comprueba por el hecho de que
los dueños de propiedades han sido los líderes de rebeliones antiimpuestos
en varios estados. Los impuestos a la propiedad  son onerosos porque son
altos y visibles. Robert Hall y Alvin Rabushka del Hoover Institution han
demostrado que las familias podrían hacer su declaración de impuestos en una
postal si el sistema actual fuese reemplazado por una tasa única de 20%,
eximiendo del pago a los de bajos ingresos. Pero no toman en cuenta si ese
sistema más simple y eficiente sería a la vez una tentación para que el
Congreso y el presidente aumenten la tasa, a través del tiempo, para
financiar viejos programas e iniciar otros nuevos.
<dd>	
Mi colega de la Universidad de Chicago Casey Mulligan y yo estamos
compilando pruebas sobre que la estructura impositiva está íntimamente
ligada al gasto gubernamental. Los impuestos al valor agregado comenzaron
con tasas módicas en los años 60. Hoy el IVA en Europa excede 20%. El
resultado es que el IVA ha permitido una rápida expansión del gasto
gubernamental.
<dd>	
Los impuestos del Seguro Social tienen una tasa única aplicable desde el
primer dólar de ingresos. Comenzaron siendo muy bajos en los años 30, pero
fueron aumentando hasta hoy, cuando los aportes del patrón y del empleado
significan 15% de los sueldos. Tales impuestos han sobrepasado 25% en muchos
países europeos. Impuestos de tasa única del Seguro Social han sido una
manera cómo los gobiernos han recabado inmensas cantidades de dinero. En
Estados Unidos proveen casi la misma cantidad que el impuesto sobre la renta
individual.
<dd>	
La estrecha relación entre la estructura impositiva y los gastos
gubernamentales indica que la simplificación tiene que ser combinada con un
mayor control del gasto público. Un presupuesto equilibrado puede ser un
paso en la dirección correcta, siempre y cuando el equilibrio se alcance
bajando gastos y no subiendo impuestos.
<dd>	
Ultimamente el gasto gubernamental en Estados Unidos ha sido frenado por la
recaudación. Tanto el presidente Clinton como los miembros de ambos partidos
en el Congreso hubieran propuesto aumentos considerables a los gastos en
salud y en otros programas si el electorado no los hubiera obligado a
preocuparse del déficit. El gasto público de muchas naciones europeas fuera
mayor si no tuviesen que mantener su déficit presupuestario por debajo de 3%
del PIB para ser admitidos en la unión monetaria planeada para fin del siglo.
<dd>	
Pero hay que encontrar otras maneras de limitar gastos, especialmente si se
introduce la tasa única. Se podría establecer un tope del gasto federal en
función del PIB, con la excepción en tiempo de guerra u otra emergencia
nacional. O fijar como límite el actual nivel en función del PIB, a menos
que una supermayoría en el Congreso, de 60% o más, vote por una proporción
mayor.
<dd>	
A menos que se combine con mejores controles del gasto gubernamental, los
grandes beneficios de una tasa única o de sistemas simplificados se
desperdiciarían en expansiones manirrotas, subsidiando industrias, la
agricultura, la beneficencia pública y demás programas políticamente
atractivos. ©<p>

<title>SEGURO SOCIAL: APRENDIENDO DE AMERICA LATINA -- 11/14/96</title>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>SEGURO SOCIAL: APRENDIENDO DE AMERICA LATINA
</h2>
Gary S. Becker*<br>
<p>
BUENOS AIRES (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Desde 1989, Argentina rápidamente ha introducido
revolucionarias reformas para reducir el control y las regulaciones
gubernamentales. La privatización de su sistema de seguridad social ha sido
el paso más importante en los últimos dos años. La experiencia argentina
muestra que, aun bajo circunstancias económicas muy difíciles, una nación
puede convertir exitosamente su viejo sistema de reparto en un plan privado
de pensiones, con cuentas individuales.
<p>
El sistema de reparto cobra impuestos a los trabajadores para pagar las
pensiones de los retirados. El impuesto combinado a trabajadores y
empleadores en Argentina había alcanzado 50% de la nómina, una aplastante
carga que desalentaba la creación de puestos de trabajo, por lo que el
desempleo es de 17%.
<p>
Para evitar tanto los impuestos de Seguro Social como las exageradas
regulaciones, muchos trabajadores y empresas se pasaron a la economía
informal, estimándose que casi la mitad de los trabajadores argentinos
trabaja ilegalmente.
<p>
Cuando tantos trabajadores dejaron de aportar al Seguro Social, la
proporción de aportantes a beneficiarios llegó a ser uno a uno, la más alta
en el mundo. Así se creo un círculo vicioso de altos impuestos a la nómina
empujando a trabajadores a la informalidad, lo cual presionaba para aumentar
aún más los impuestos.
<p>
El programa de privatización de pensiones iniciado en 1994 le da la opción
a los trabajadores de quedarse en el viejo sistema estatal o transferir sus
contribuciones -fijadas en no menos de 11% de sus salarios- a uno de los
muchos fondos privados. Más del 60% han optado por los fondos privados.
<p>
Los trabajadores, con cuentas individuales, acumulan un patrimonio para su
retiro, además de que ganan intereses y dividendos sobre sus inversiones.
Los fondos hasta ahora han invertido principalmente en bonos
gubernamentales, pero se irán cambiando a acciones y bonos de empresas
privadas a medida que se recupere la economía argentina. Estas inversiones
ampliarán el mercado de capitales y mejores rendimientos aumentarán la tasa
de ahorro. Para impedir riesgos excesivos, el gobierno argentino supervisa
la colocación de los fondos.
<p>
Los impuestos a la nómina que pagan trabajadores y empresas han podido
reducirse en 10 puntos. El mejor rendimiento de los fondos privados
significa que los trabajadores pueden aportar menos de lo que hacían al
viejo sistema y, de todos modos, recibir pensiones mayores. Y el aporte a la
seguridad social, en el caso de los trabajadores dejó de ser un impuesto
para convertirse en una inversión, por lo que algunos trabajadores comienzan
a abandonar la economía informal.
<p>
Los economistas tienden a preocuparse por la transición de un sistema de
reparto a la seguridad social privada. Pero Argentina está confirmando lo
que Chile demostró hace 15 años: la transición puede ser manejada fácilmente
porque el sistema privado es tanto más eficiente.
<p>
Aún así los opositores a la privatización mantienen que no conviene en
Estados Unidos y Europa e insisten en asustar a los pensionados diciendo que
se les recortarán los beneficios. Todo lo contrario, la transición debe ser
mucho más fácil en Estados Unidos y Europa por gozar de mercados de
capitales mucho más desarrollados que en la Argentina. Pero sí se hará más
difícil en la medida de que se posponga porque el número de retirados está
creciendo más rápidamente que el número de trabajadores.
<p>
Las naciones industrializadas deben sentirse agradecidas porque los
latinoamericanos están mostrando el camino a seguirse y han sido pioneros en
la privatización del seguro social. Tanto los pensionados como los
trabajadores de las naciones ricas apoyarían la privatización si supieran lo
exitosa que ha sido en Argentina, un país con mayores problemas económicos
que las más estancadas economías europeas. ©

<title>Benegas: LA MAQUINA DE SUBSIDIAR -- 5/16/96</title>

<h2>
LA MAQUINA DE SUBSIDIAR
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
spanbio
.html">
Alberto Benegas-Lynch (h)*
</a>

<P>
BUENOS AIRES (AIPE).- A principios de siglo el economista y sociólogo
italiano Vilfredo Pareto decía que es difícil  implantar la libertad
económica porque "el privilegio, incluso si debe costar 100 a la masa y no
producir más que 50 a los privilegiados, perdiéndose el resto en falsos
costos, será en general bien aceptado, puesto que la masa no comprende que
está siendo despojada, mientras que los privilegiados se dan perfecta cuenta
de las ventajas de las que gozan". 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Una vez que se abren las compuertas de los subsidios se monta una máquina
que hace que se desate una competencia por los recursos escasos de lo que se
ofrece. De este modo los empresarios desvían su atención del mercado y la
centran en quienes otorgan subsidios. Se desata así una lucha para ver quién
saca mejor partida a expensas de los demás, ya que el subsidio
necesariamente proviene de los bolsillos de otros que resultan expoliados.
Pero aquí no se trata simplemente de una suma cero, es decir, de una
transferencia coactiva de unos a otros. La competencia por obtener se desata
debido a que los recursos son limitados. También son limitados los
privilegios, aunque no se trate de una transferencia directa de recursos,
puesto que si todos son privilegiados no habría privilegiados.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Esa competencia se lleva a cabo en base a ofertas de uno u otro tipo que
realizan los competidores a manos de los oferentes de privilegios. No
necesariamente debe recurrirse al cohecho directo o indirecto. Pero, en
cualquier caso, para proceder en este sentido se montan sistemas de cabildeo
para acercarse al poder, sea para convencer al burócrata de la "bondad" de
la propuesta o, debido a que no hay criterio racional para otorgar el
subsidio, para concretar una oferta monetaria a los efectos de que se
resuelva el privilegio en beneficio del postulante.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Supongamos que se trata de un subsidio de $10 millones; en este caso el
empresario estará dispuesto a invertir hasta $9 millones para lograr el
subsidio de referencia, lo cual, desde la perspectiva del resto de la
comunidad significará $19 millones derrochados. Los primeros $10 millones
significan un despilfarro debido a que todo subsidio implica que se sacan
recursos de las áreas preferidas por la gente hacia las áreas preferidas por
los gobernantes del momento.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El sustento de lo que hemos bautizado como "la máquina de subsidiar"
radica en los incentivos que generan marcos institucionales debilitados y
corrompidos. En este sentido, David Friedman señala que en regímenes de este
tipo a muy pocos se les ocurre bregar por la abrogación de cientos de leyes
para que todos se beneficien por igual de una sociedad abierta, puesto que
resulta mucho más expedito y fructífero pelear por una nueva ley que otorga
un privilegio. Dice Friedman que el mecanismo consiste en buscar la manera
que 20 millones de  personas paguen un dólar cada una y el beneficiario se
alce con el botín de $20 millones. De este modo sólo se oirá la voz fuerte
de quien busca el privilegio y no se oirá la de los perjudicados que
individualmente pierden poco. Incluso, si el beneficiario contrata
pseudointelectuales y pseudoperiodistas, para que justifiquen el desmán,
logrará que los expoliados lo apoyen. Solamente se oye la voz apagada entre
tanta bulla de intelectuales que quieren quebrar un sistema en el que los
incentivos operan para que se robe al prójimo en lugar de concentrarse en la
producción sin privilegios. Estas voces resultan anémicas en medio de una
feroz puja para que los vándalos puedan enriquecerse a costa  de los demás.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es por todo esto que se tiene la falsa impresión de que la sociedad
consiste en una batalla campal resultante de una inexorable confrontación de
intereses. De esta visión surgen las propuestas fascistas del corporativismo
conducentes a los tristemente célebres "pactos sociales" por los que los
capitostes de cada sector deben negociar en torno a una mesa para dar la
impresión de que intereses irreconciliables se negocian en aras de una nunca
alcanzada "paz social". Esta visión no permite ver la armonía de intereses
inherentes al estado de derecho y la igualdad ante la ley. Quienes comparten
esta visión no parecen capaces de entender la coordinación libre y
voluntaria que se lleva a cabo a través del proceso de mercado.

<h2>
ECONOMÍA PARA GOBERNANTES
</h2>


Carlos Boloña B.*
<p>

LIMA <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- En América Latina, los gobernantes de turno, los ministros de
Hacienda y los políticos en general no conocen -u olvidan- los principios
económicos más elementales, y aplican frecuentemente políticas populistas
que pueden parecer positivas por sus efectos inmediatos, pero que al final
generan profundos daños y padecimientos.
<dd>        Por ello, debemos siempre recordar a nuestras clases políticas los
fundamentos esenciales de la ciencia económica. Así, puede contribuirse a
que no se repitan los graves errores del pasado. Ojalá nuestros gobernantes
comprendan y recuerden estos principios básicos:
<dd>· El bolsillo es el órgano más sensible. Por tanto, nadie mejor que uno
mismo para cuidar su propio bolsillo.  Ello quiere decir, además, que la
naturaleza humana responde a incentivos: los individuos prefieren tener más
a tener menos. La gente prefiere un dólar en su bolsillo que en el bolsillo
de otro o del gobierno, salvo que reciba a cambio de ese dólar un bien o un
servicio equivalente al mismo. No es de extrañar que los individuos se
defiendan cuando les intentan reducir sus ingresos. Las políticas de
cualquier gobierno que vayan en contra de la naturaleza humana fracasarán
tarde o temprano.
<dd>· Nadie cuida lo que no es suyo. Este es el fundamento de la institución y
el fortalecimiento de la propiedad privada. Otros tipos o regímenes de
propiedad -como la estatal, social, cooperativa o cualquier otra que
inventen los "ingenieros sociales"- llevan a que nadie se responsabilice de
ella. Tarde o temprano, todos tratan de sacar ventaja de ella, a costa de la
participación de los demás.
<dd>· No se puede gastar más de lo que se tiene. Esto puede hacerse por un
tiempo, por medio del endeudamiento, pero al final las deudas se pagan. El
individuo, la empresa o el gobierno que intente romper esta regla terminará
quebrado o en la insolvencia. Al principio, deja de pagar sus deudas, luego
pierde sus activos y, finalmente, cae en la quiebra -que es sinónimo de
dejar de operar, empobrecerse y quedar sumido en la miseria-.
<dd>· Los países también quiebran. Este es un principio derivado del anterior.
Cuando gastan más de lo que tienen, los países primero caen en cesación de
pagos con el exterior y luego optan por el camino de malutilizar el
monopolio que poseen de imprimir dinero discrecionalmente. Ello genera
inflación, que es la forma más hipócrita de encubrir la quiebra.
<dd>· No hay almuerzos gratis. Definitivamente, las facturas siempre se pagan.
Ello no quiere decir que siempre las paga quien debe, ya que algunas veces
los grupos de interés logran pasarle la factura al resto de la población. Al
recibir una ventaja del gobierno -por ejemplo, jubilarse a temprana edad o
con sueldos del personal activo, o subsidiar la producción nacional con los
impuestos a la importación-, hacen que estas facturas se financien con el
dinero de los demás.
<dd>· Lo que no nos cuesta lo hacemos fiesta. Esta es una verdad tan evidente
que la vemos a diario. La gente no valora las cosas cuando no le ha costado
dinero o esfuerzo.  Cuando te regalan las cosas, no las cuidas ni las
consideras. Esto es cierto en el caso de un bien material, pero también de
un servicio como la educación o la salud. Es preferible, por ello, que quien
reciba algo, tenga que sacrificarse también con algo -puede no ser dinero
sino tiempo u otro recurso que pueda aportar-.
<dd>· Los precios y el empleo no se determinan por decreto. Los precios, el
empleo productivo y el crecimiento económico no se pueden establecer por
decreto. Los precios se determinan por la utilidad y por la escasez relativa
de los bienes o servicios disponibles en un momento dado. Así, el tipo de
cambio refleja la escasez o abundancia relativa del dólar; la tasa de
interés, la del crédito; y el salario, la de la mano de obra. El gobierno,
cada vez que intenta fijar o controlar precios, sólo entorpece el
funcionamiento del mercado, generando escasez o abundancia artificiales
-léase mercados negros o desempleo-.
<dd>· Más gasto público equivale a más impuestos. La idea de mayor gasto público
es apetecible cuando se piensa en aumentos salariales, gasto social o de
inversión. Sin embargo, ese gasto viene aparejado con impuestos. A alguien
hay que quitarle para pagarlo. La primera tentación es quitarle a los ricos,
pero generalmente eso no resulta suficiente. La segunda tentación es
endeudarse, pero toda deuda se tiene que pagar. La tercera tentación es
generar inflación, que resulta el impuesto más injusto, puesto que empobrece
al asalariado, al jubilado y a la mayoría de la población.
<dd>· La pobreza se combate creando riqueza. Quitar riqueza a los que tienen
para dársela a los que no tienen es el camino seguro para empobrecer un
país. Igualar es sinónimo de empobrecer. &copy

<title>EL CANCER DE LA CORRUPCION -- 11/14/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>EL CANCER DE LA CORRUPCION
</h2>
Carlos Boloña B.*<br>
<p>
LIMA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Defino la corrupción como "el uso del poder público para el
enriquecimiento privado". Ciertamente que los beneficios obtenidos
ilícitamente pueden tomar la forma de dividendos políticos, pero en este
artículo centraré la atención en las causas y consecuencias de sus
beneficios económicos.
<P>
La tentación de incurrir en corrupción depende de tres variables: 
<ol>
<li>El monto de las transacciones económicas en las que participa el funcionario;
<li>Su duración en el cargo; y, 
<li>La sofisticación y complejidad de los servicios públicos en cuya provisión participa. 
</ol>
Así es que la corrupción
suele ser mayor en las compras de armamentos y pertrechos militares; en
segundo lugar, en las compras de bienes de capital; luego, en los contratos
de ingeniería civil y compras de productos; y, finalmente, en los honorarios
por consultorías.
<p>
La corrupción es tan antigua como la institución del gobierno y hoy en día
es un fenómeno global, cuyo monto se estima alcanza la cifra de tres
millones de millones de dólares. Ningún país se puede considerar libre del
mal, aunque no todos lo padecen en iguales dimensiones: la corrupción es más
común en naciones con regímenes de gobierno arbitrarios, autoritarios y de
planificación centralizada.
<p>
La necesidad de combatir la corrupción es insoslayable, puesto tiene efectos
perversos para la vida en sociedad: socava las bases morales de la
democracia y de la economía de mercado al introducir distorsiones en la
información y el conocimiento que se deberían transmitir a través de la
libre competencia de bienes y servicios políticos y económicos. Por ello, la
corrupción empobrece. Está demostrado que los países que cultivan normas de
ética y moral elevados terminan creciendo más. Un informe reciente estima en
$20 mil millones las cuentas en bancos suizos de líderes africanos.
Además, la corrupción genera ineficiencia en términos de pérdida o de mala
asignación de los recursos productivos de una sociedad. Algunos estudios
señalan que los montos destinados a la corrupción pueden representar desde
2% hasta más de 50% de los costos totales de los bienes y servicios que
producen las naciones.
<p>
La corrupción no sólo afecta el crecimiento sino también a la equidad. A
través de ella, los privilegiados se benefician de las operaciones y
transacciones corruptas a expensas de los pobres. De esta manera, se crea un
gobierno ineficaz cuyo único objetivo es seguir corrompiendo para mantenerse
en el poder, dejando de lado las prácticas del "buen gobierno" y generando
inestabilidad política.
<p>
La falta de limitaciones al poder ejercido por diferentes dependencias
gubernamentales contribuye a una deficiente rendición de cuentas y la
corrupción infringe un grave y profundo daño moral a los ciudadanos al
premiar la conducta ilícita y castigar la honesta. Con ello genera un
ambiente de cinismo que, al difundirse, provoca la alienación y la apatía
ciudadanas.
<p>
La ecuación de la corrupción es la siguiente: Corrupción = Monopolio +
Arbitrariedad - Transparencia.
<p>
La corrupción surge de los monopolios artificiales, cuando existe
arbitrariedad o discrecionalidad sin límites y cuando no existe
transparencia en el proceso de toma de decisiones. Por tanto, a mayor grado
de arbitrariedad y a menor grado de transparencia, mayor será el nivel de
corrupción.
<p>
La mala organización del Poder Público es una fuente segura de corrupción.
Cuando los Poderes del Estado funcionan sin independencia entre sí, abundan
las tentaciones de corrupción. En más de un país latinoamericano, por
ejemplo, el Poder Legislativo le cobra favores políticos al Poder Judicial,
quien, entonces, no lo controla ni fiscaliza.
<p>
La pregunta es cómo reducir la corrupción. Si se eliminan los monopolios se
reduce la arbitrariedad y se incrementa la transparencia, permitiendo así
combatir eficazmente la corrupción. Entre las medidas concretas para lograrlo:
<ul>
<li>Aplicar cabalmente las instituciones de la economía de mercado y el Estado de Derecho, reduciendo el intervencionismo estatal en la economía.
<li>Establecer reglas generales, iguales para todos. Un arancel uniforme, sin exoneraciones, y un impuesto general a las ventas uniforme, sin excepciones, contribuirían a disminuirla.
<li>Fomentar la transparencia en las operaciones del gobierno. Convocar, por ejemplo,  licitaciones con supervisión internacional y publicación de resultados.
<li>Simplificar al máximo los trámites administrativos.
<li>Concientizar a la ciudadanía, puesto que la educación es la clave de la transparencia.
<li>Encarcelar a algunos cuantos "peces gordos" de la corrupción para que sirva de ejemplo y escarmiento.
<li>Crear una carrera administrativa seria, que acabe con la politiquería y el compadrazgo.
<li>Subir los costos y reducir los beneficios de la corrupción, para demostrar que la honradez es rentable y que el ser honesto rinde sus beneficios.
<li>Aprobar normas de conducta que promuevan la rendición de cuentas, abriendo los estados financieros de las empresas que hagan contribuciones a partidos políticos.
<li>Crear una Comisión Independiente contra la Corrupción, bajo un esquema parecido al de Hong Kong, uno de los pocos países que ha avanzado consistentemente en este terreno.
</ul>
Para sacar adelante estas medidas, se requerirá de una férrea voluntad
política y de un poder moral vigoroso, que congregue a todos los sectores de
la opinión pública. ©

<TITLE>Bongiovanni: Argentina: El Gran Desafio del Nuevo Ministro -- 8/7/96</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>ARGENTINA: EL GRAN DESAFIO DEL NUEVO MINISTRO</H2>
Gerardo Bongiovanni*<p>
ROSARIO, ARGENTINA (<a href ="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Roque Fernández, el nuevo ministro de Economía,
tiene credenciales técnicas intachables. Graduado de la Universidad de
Chicago fue uno de los creadores del Centro de Estudios Macroeconómicos
Argentinos (CEMA). El peso argentino ha sobrellevado bien la transición,
pero ahora Fernández tendrá que afrontar el déficit fiscal que lleva ya ocho
trimestres y que se ha agudizado en los últimos tiempos. 
<dd>
Uno de los principales problemas de la economía argentina es el persistente
aumento del gasto público que en  1991 fue de $47.300 millones y que se ha
disparado 74% en cuatro años, alcanzando $82.300 millones para 1995. Es
cierto que buena parte de este aumento se explica por el reconocimiento de
deudas públicas -como en el caso de las jubilaciones y pensiones-, pero si
se piensa que en este mismo lapso se han privatizado decenas de empresas
públicas -casi todas ellas deficitarias-, transferido cargas al sector
privado, como el mantenimiento de rutas ahora realizado a través de peajes,
y se han eliminado organismos y dependencias, tal incremento resulta
verdaderamente asombroso.
<dd>
Algunos ejemplos ilustran la urgencia de reformas: la Presidencia de la
Nación, con sus diez secretarías y doce organismos dependientes tiene 20.000
personas a su cargo y un presupuesto anual de más de $1.200 millones, casi
el doble que lo que gasta el Poder Judicial Federal.
<dd>
El número de secretarías y subsecretrarías ministeriales no ha hecho más
que aumentar en los últimos años, no obstante un decreto del año 1990 que
limitaba su número. A principios de 1991 había 10 secretarías y 55
subsecretarias; hoy llegan a 58 y 111 respectivamente. Ahora se anuncia la
decisión de eliminar algunas, pero simultáneamente se crearán tres o cuatro
nuevos ministerios que seguramente compensarán dichas reducciones.
<dd>
Capítulo aparte es el llamado gasto social. En Argentina los gastos
sociales representan más del 60% del total de gastos del gobierno. Estos
dineros no llegan a quienes lo necesitan sino que se quedan en el largo
camino de la burocracia. La paradoja es que se crean organismos para ayudar
a los pobres y luego 70% de sus presupuestos se gastan en sueldos de
burócratas. La única pobreza que así se alivia es la de los empleados públicos. 
<dd>
Pero indudablemente donde mayor es el caos y la irresponsabilidad oficial
es en las provincias y municipios. El empleo público provincial pasó de
580.000 agentes en 1991 a más de 1.100.000 en 1995, un incremento de 90%. En
tanto el gasto total de las provincias y municipios creció en 82% desde 1991
a 1995, de $20.700 millones a $37.700 millones.
En algunos estados hay un burócrata provincial por cada diez habitantes. Y
en general, el rubro salarios consume entre 70% y 80% de los presupuestos
provinciales, lo que claramente es indicativo del exceso de personal.
<dd>
El gobierno nacional trata de afrontar la situación mediante "pactos
fiscales", a través de los cuales compromete a los gobiernos provinciales
fondos y les exige como contrapartida que avancen en las privatizaciones de
bancos, energía, agua, etc. Hasta ahora los resultados han sido mediocres
debido a que, bajo el sistema fiscal argentino, el gobierno nacional recauda
la mayor parte de los impuestos y los "coparticipa" entre las provincias,
que a su vez hacen los mismo con los municipios.
<dd>
Este sistema fiscal de "arriba hacia abajo", en donde los estados y
ciudades generan una pequeña parte de su presupuesto y reciben el resto,
desalienta toda intención de ahorrar y reformar, ya que no hay premios ni
castigos, a la vez que se aleja a la administración pública del control
ciudadano. En Argentina, el grueso de las funciones gubernamentales son
asumidas por el gobierno federal.
<dd>
El ministro Fernández parece estar consciente de la necesidad de
profundizar las reformas, reducir el peso de los impuestos e imponer
disciplina y eficiencia en el sector público. De no lograrlo, los mercados
internacionales nos impondrán la necesaria disciplina, un escenario que no
sería muy bonito. ©

<h2>
LOS FUNDAMENTOS DE LA SOCIEDAD LIBRE
</h2>
Nathaniel Branden*
<p>
WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Poco antes del derrumbe de la Unión Soviética fui
invitado a participar en una conferencia en Acapulco, México. Otro de los
expositores era Gennady Gerasimov, entonces portavoz de Gorbachev. Comenzó
su discurso con un cuento en el que la Unión Soviética había invadido con
éxito y conquistado al resto del mundo, con una excepción, Nueva Zelanda. Se
había tomado la decisión política de no invadir ese país. ¿Por qué? Para que
las autoridades soviéticas pudieran conocer el precio de mercado de las
cosas. Toda la audiencia soltó la carcajada y yo me quedé petrificado.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mi mente retrocedió 40 años atrás, cuando Ayn Rand me guiaba en la lectura
de Ludwig von Mises, el economista que por vez primera apuntó la
imposibilidad del cálculo económico bajo el socialismo, explicando que esa
era la razón por la cual el sistema socialista terminaría con un colapso
económico. Tantos años más tarde, un representante de la Unión Soviética
admitía públicamente, a manera de chiste, el argumento de Mises, tratándolo
como una evidente realidad.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ya muy pocos creen seriamente en el socialismo como un modelo viable de
organización social, pero está todavía lejos la victoria del capitalismo.
Instituciones como Cato, además de académicos e intelectuales alrededor del
mundo, aportan crecientes evidencias que ningún otro sistema puede competir
en cuanto a productividad y nivel de vida con el libre mercado, a la vez que
se demuestra que los gobiernos no sólo fracasan en resolver los problemas
sociales sino que empeoran las mismas condiciones que tratan de mejorar.
Pero como decidido combatiente por la libertad me pregunto ¿por qué la pelea
ha sido tan larga y por qué aparecen cien cabezas cuando le cortamos alguna
al monstruo estatista?
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Vivimos en una cultura que enseña que la moralidad es el autosacrificio, la
compasión y el servicio a los demás. No asociamos la moralidad con ambición,
realización, innovación ni con las ganancias. Ahora llaman egoísta a quien
hace lo que quiere en vez de hacer lo que nosotros queremos que él haga.
Pero si comparamos el bien que logran los que sienten compasión por los
demás con el logrado por aquellos que inventan y alcanzan éxito creando
industrias y nuevos servicios, no hay duda de que los últimos han hecho
mucho más por la humanidad.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Uno de los grandes problemas que enfrenta la sociedad libre es la
disonancia entre los valores que realmente mejoran el bienestar de la gente
y las cosas que se enseñan como nobles y morales. Mientras exista tal
incongruencia, la batalla por la libertad no podrá ser permanentemente
ganada. En nuestro siglo hemos sufrido rebeliones virulentas contra los
valores de la razón, objetividad, la ciencia, la verdad y la lógica de parte
de filosofías como el postmodernismo, postestructuralismo,
deconstruccionismo y el determinismo histórico. No es accidente que nuestros
contrincantes son todos estatistas, pero si no se ejerce la razón lo que
queda es la coerción.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Otro valor en decadencia es la autorresponsabilidad. Asumíamos que el
crecimiento normal era la progresión de la dependencia de la niñez a la
responsabilidad del adulto. Uno de los fundamentos principales del
liberalismo es la premisa de que tenemos que asumir la responsabilidad por
nuestras propias vidas. No hay otra forma en que funcione la sociedad
civilizada. Y durante demasiado tiempo ha existido una animadversión contra
el empresario. Sin embargo, si entendemos que el hombre de negocios es clave
para convertir los nuevos conocimientos en formas de mejorar el bienestar de
la gente, nos damos cuenta que ser antiempresarial es un error. Pero sin la
dimensión moral y espiritual lograremos apenas ganar el debate en el corto
plazo, mientras los estatistas asumen su manto de moralidad, por más daño
que causen sus programas. 
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pienso que no hay batalla más noble que la batalla por la libertad. Y no se
trata de una batalla a favor de la empresa privada ni del mercado. Se trata
de una batalla por la propiedad sobre nuestra vida misma.&copy; <p>

<H2>LAS CIUDADES NECESITAN MENOS, NO MAS, GOBIERNO</H2>
Harry Browne*<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El gobierno no funciona. No mantiene la seguridad en
nuestras ciudades, no educa bien a nuestros hijos, la beneficencia
gubernamental es un incentivo a no hacer nada y no entrega el correo a
tiempo. Sin embargo, durante la campaña electoral oiremos múltiples
propuestas sobre nuevos programas para arreglar tales problemas, a pesar de
haber sido el gobierno quien los ha causado.
<dd>	
Examinemos los tres principales retos que enfrentan las ciudades hoy en
día: pésimo sistema educativo, programas desbocados de beneficencia y
crímenes violentos. Aunque parecen ser problemas eternos son en realidad
relativamente nuevos. Estados Unidos era muy diferente en los años 50.
<dd>	
La educación no era perfecta, pero los graduados de bachillerato podían al
menos leer los exámenes de admisión a la universidad. La gran mayoría de los
muchachos se graduaban de bachillerato con una educación básica en historia,
geografía, ciencias y matemáticas.
<dd>
La beneficencia estatal era prácticamente desconocida. De ello se ocupaban
instituciones privadas y si acaso había una pequeña oficina en la parte
trasera de la alcaldía. En tales sitios, cualquiera tenía que explicar cómo
se había metido en problemas y qué estaba dispuesto a hacer para salir de
ellos. Si su historia era creíble y cumplía con sus promesas, se le ayudaba.
Debido a que no se necesitaba mucha beneficencia pública, muchos
desconocíamos su existencia.
<dd>
La estadística de crímenes eran una fracción de la actual. Cuando crecí en
un suburbio de Los Angeles, solía caminar una milla para ir al cine, a las
10 de la noche los viernes, sin la menor preocupación por mi seguridad. Hoy
no me siento seguro caminando las mismas calles a la 10 de la mañana.
<dd>
¿Qué ha cambiado desde los años 50? Mucho y el cambio más grande de todos
ha sido la invasión del gobierno federal a nuestras ciudades y nuestras vidas.
<dd>
El patrón es el mismo en todas partes. El gobierno federal ofreció pequeños
subsidios para complementar los presupuestos municipales y estatales; luego
aumentó los subsidios. Una vez que el gobierno local se había convertido en
adicto a tales subsidios tuvieron que obedecer para seguir recibiendo
dinero. Como resultado de todo esto, gran parte de las decisiones hoy se
toman en Washington. Los presupuestos locales son exageradamente altos, en
muchos casos porque el gobierno local tiene que gastar grandes sumas de su
propio dinero para calificar en la obtención de fondos federales.
<dd>
El Congreso republicano ha respondido prohibiendo mandatos federales que no
asuman sus costos y al ofrecer traspasar a los estados fondos libres de
ataduras. Pero ninguna de las dos respuestas es suficiente. Tenemos que
quitarnos de encima todos los mandatos federales, tanto los que paga el
gobierno central como los que no. Los políticos de Washington no saben lo
que conviene a su ciudad. Y ¿cuál es la ventaja de enviar dinero a
Washington para que luego sea devuelto? Tenemos que quitarnos al gobierno
federal de encima en educación, beneficencia y control criminal.
<dd>
Y aunque estos son los problemas más obvios no son los únicos. Washington
hace también daño interfiriendo en la construcción de carreteras, en salud,
en el ambiente, etc.
<dd>
Según el censo, el gobierno federal, estatal y local toma el 47% del
ingreso nacional en impuestos. Al tratar de resolverlo todo a través del
gobierno, hemos agravado los problemas de las ciudades e imposibilitado a
los contribuyentes enfrentar sus propios problemas.
<dd>
Debemos empezar el camino de la recuperación limitando al gobierno federal
a sólo aquellas funciones determinadas por la Constitución. Eso reduciría el
tamaño del gobierno lo suficiente como para revocar el impuesto sobre la
renta, permitiendo a las ciudades resolver sus problemas.
<dd>
Para ver el alcance de esta revolución fíjese cuánto le deducen de su
sueldo en impuesto sobre la renta y Seguro Social. Entonces pregúntese lo
que usted podría hacer con ese dinero. ¿Pondría a sus niños en colegios
privados que ofrecen mejor educación y valores? ¿Ahorraría para abrirse por
su cuenta como siempre lo ha deseado? ¿Se mudaría a una casa mejor?
¿Ayudaría más a su obra de caridad preferida?
<dd>	
Usted trabaja por ese dinero y debiera poder decidir su uso. Eso no es
función de los políticos, quitándoselo para luego devolverle lo que les
parece, como si usted fuera un niño recibiendo una mesada.
<dd>	
¿Hay algún beneficio que el gobierno le da que usted no pueda reemplazar
con creces con el dinero que ahorraría en impuestos?
<dd>	
Es hora de volver a tomar posesión de nuestras ciudades, de nuestro dinero
y de nuestras vidas. ©

<blockquote>
WASHINGTON (AIPE).- A medida que América Latina adelanta su proceso de
reforma económica se hace más evidente la necesidad de contar con un sistema
judicial eficaz. La democratización, la concentración de la población en
áreas urbanas y la apertura económica han aumentado la complejidad de la
interacción social y, en consecuencia, la demanda por servicios judiciales
en la resolución de conflictos. Además, la economía de mercado exige
definiciones claras sobre derechos y obligaciones.
<p>
El sistema judicial, que incluye todos los mecanismos necesarios para
interpretar las leyes y regulaciones, es un elemento clave en el desarrollo
económico. Sin embargo, los tribunales latinoamericanos sufren de crecientes
demoras y de corrupción, lo cual genera desconfianza en el sistema. En casi
todos los países latinoamericanos se observa una falta de consistencia en la
aplicación de la jurisprudencia, lo cual unido a retrasos en resolver casos
aumenta el costo de acceso a la justicia y también de realizar negocios e
inversiones.
<p>
A medida que aumenta el costo de la justicia, la gente reacciona acudiendo
menos a los tribunales. Un reciente estudio muestra que la mayoría de los
usuarios no se inclinan a acudir a un tribunal para resolver disputas porque
perciben el sistema como lento, incierto, costoso y de "pobre calidad". La
desconfianza en el sistema judicial es considerablemente mayor entre
empresarios pequeños y las familias de bajos ingresos.
<p>
A menudo se argumenta que se sufre de presupuestos inadecuados, pero países
como Dinamarca, Japón y Alemania, donde el público tiene gran confianza en
el sistema judicial, el gobierno asigna porciones menores de su presupuesto
que Argentina, Brasil, Colombia y México, las naciones cuyos tribunales
gozan de la menor confianza por parte del público. No se ha comprobado
relación alguna entre la eficiencia judicial y el tamaño del presupuesto
asignado a los tribunales. Encuestas realizadas en Argentina, Venezuela,
Ecuador y Perú muestran que entre 55% y 75% del público tiene una muy baja
opinión del sector judicial. La percepción general es que el entrenamiento
de los jueces es pobre y que no se garantiza la igualdad ante la ley.
<p>
Una pregunta clave es por qué los jueces a menudo se oponen a las reformas.
La respuesta se basa en que funcionarios gubernamentales se aprovechan de
los tribunales para obtener rentas ilícitas, lo cual en gran parte es
posible debido a la amplia discrecionalidad monopólica de que gozan los
jueces.  Por ejemplo, la costumbre de que los jueces reciben por separado a
las partes crea fuertes incentivos a la corrupción. Como tampoco hay normas
establecidas sobre el lapso de tiempo antes de iniciar el juicio o sobre su
duración, esto se presta a que funcionarios del tribunal cobren por agilizar
los trámites.
<p>
Otro problema es la frecuente concentración de poder en las manos del juez,
quien asume múltiples roles en cuanto a la programación estratégica, el
manejo de personal, la administración de recursos, control presupuestario y
la adjudicación de casos, todo lo cual distrae su atención de la resolución
de casos pendientes y abre múltiples posibilidades de corrupción, debido a
la ausencia de mecanismos internos y externos de control.
<p>
La inercia frente a la necesidad de las reformas judiciales en parte se
explica porque los beneficios, tales como mayor inversión y crecimiento
económico  son generales y a largo plazo, mientras que el costo es
individual e inmediato:  la desaparición de los ingresos por corrupción. Por
lo tanto, parte de las reformas tendrían que incluir mayores beneficios a
corto plazo dirigidos a los funcionarios del sistema judicial, a través de
generosas pensiones, promociones para los jueces y empleados de los
tribunales, nuevas instalaciones y más amplios presupuestos.
<p>
La corrupción implica un rompimiento del código de ética colectivo que
beneficia al individuo que paga bajo la mesa para conseguir lo que desea del
tribunal, pero la sociedad se perjudica por una caída de la productividad a
través del tiempo causada por la generalizada percepción de que la
asignación de recursos se hace de manera poco equitativa, al ser determinada
por prácticas corruptas. El estudio de la historia económica prueba que la
corrupción sistémica observada en la administración de justicia en América
Latina seguirá contribuyendo al retraso económico de la región. ©

<h2>
BRASIL PICA EN PUNTA
</h2>
Alejandro Antonio Chafuen*
<p>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Hay tres elementos claves que los ejecutivos de
empresas multinacionales toman en cuenta al decidir sobre dónde invertir:
estabilidad política, estabilidad monetaria y respeto a los derechos de
propiedad. Justo cuando los titulares de la prensa mundial reportan el
impasse entre Estados Unidos y China por la piratería no controlada de
películas, música y programas de computación, el presidente del Brasil,
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, procedió a firmar una ley de patentes de
productos farmacéuticos que puede servir de modelo al mundo y que representa
un importante paso de Brasil hacia el liderazgo económico en nuestro hemisferio.
Brasil enfrenta tremendos retos económicos. Debe mantener una moneda
estable, reforzar su sector financiero, liberalizar sus leyes laborales y
privatizar un gran número de empresas estatales. Luego de varias décadas de
equivocadas inversiones, la reformas resultan dolorosas. Para hacer menos
traumática esa transformación, Brasil requiere considerables influjos de
inversión extranjera. La nueva ley de patentes hará mucho más fácil atraer
el capital requerido y debido a la debilidad de la actual legislación
argentina en la materia, aquellas inversiones que hubieran hecho en dicho
país las industrias de alta tecnología ahora irán al Brasil.
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     	La nueva ley brasileña es un hito en la dinámica de la
infraestructura económica mundial para la innovación médica. Favorece la
medicina, la ciencia, la investigación, el crecimiento económico y la
atención médica para la gente del Brasil y el resto de América del Sur. Se
trata de un nuevo ingrediente en la estrategia de liberalización política y
económica, impulsando al Brasil hacia un verdadero liderazgo entre las
economías en desarrollo y los mercados emergentes, fijando rumbo para
alcanzar un posición clave entre las democracias industriales  del siglo XXI.
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     	Desde tiempos de Adam Smith, prominentes economistas han mantenido
que la riqueza de las naciones depende de un vasto mercado, sin trabas a la
división del trabajo y respeto por la propiedad privada. La inmensa riqueza
natural y humana del Brasil, junto a su nueva posición de liderazgo en el
dinámico mercado latinoamericano, prometen ofrecer oportunidades económicas
de excepción. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Analistas con los más diversos enfoques, incluyendo tanto al Vaticano como
al Valle Silicón, coinciden en que los activos más importantes en la era de
la información son intangibles. La fortaleza económica hoy depende en gran
parte de ideas, información y conocimientos, lo cual convierte la propiedad
intelectual en ingrediente esencial. Una buena ley de patentes, como la
recién promulgada en Brasil, es de especial importancia para la innovación
farmacéutica, al reducir el inmenso riesgo que conlleva el descubrimiento y
desarrollo de nuevas medicinas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
El costo promedio de una nueva droga es de $500 millones y el proceso toma
12 años. Lo sorprendente es que el grueso de los descubrimientos médicos no
se logran en dependencias gubernamentales ni universidades, sino en las
empresas privadas que realizan las investigaciones. En este sentido, las
estadísticas en Estados Unidos son determinantes: 99% de las medicinas más
frecuentemente prescritas fueron desarrolladas por la industria privada y el
equivalente al 92% de las nuevas sustancias químicas aprobadas entre 1981 y
1990 provinieron de laboratorios privados. Sin embargo, las universidades,
los hospitales, la industria y los gobiernos forman parte del esfuerzo
conjunto de investigación que el sistema de patentes hace posible. 
Para Brasil, el beneficio de la nueva ley será la transferencia de
conocimientos y   tecnologías, enriqueciendo sus procesos de investigación y
desarrollo. La empresa innovadora conoce más que cualquier otra las
caracterísiticas sobre las nuevas medicinas, por lo que juega un papel
crucial para la comercialización y transferencia de información al cuerpo
médico. Sin patentes, cualquiera puede vender las medicinas, pero se pierde
el importante aporte al tratamiento de pacientes hecho por la firma que las
desarrolló, imposibilitando a su vez la creación de centros locales de
investigación y desarrollo. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ultimamente, un impresionante grupo de naciones -Canadá, la República Checa,
Corea del Sur, México y Taiwan, entre otras- ha mejorado substancialmente
sus leyes de patentes y ahora Brasil se coloca a la cabeza de ese grupo. Las
naciones en este sentido rezagadas, como Argentina y la India, pagarán un
alto precio, en el retraso de sus centros de investigación y en la salud de
la ciudadanía.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
La idea del hemisferio americano unido por la libertad de comercio, la
tradición constitucional republicana y los derechos humanos sigue siendo un
sueño que sólo se hará realidad con la convergencia de estructuras legales
basadas en los principios que han permitido a las civilizaciones madurar y
desarrollarse. Los derechos de propiedad intelectual forman parte integral
de tales principios y la iniciativa brasileña favorece justamente esa
dinámica. <&copy;p>

<H2>VENEZUELA: SUBDESARROLLO LABORAL</H2>
Vladimir Chelminski*<br>
<p>



CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)-- Los sueldos que recibe la mayoría de los venezolanos no
alcanzan para vivir. Con el salario mínimo diario no se compran ni siquiera
dos Big Mac. Los políticos, quienes insisten en ignorar las raíces del
problema, creen que elevando el salario mínimo resolverán el problema.
Cada año se aumenta el salario mínimo con la ilusión de proteger al
trabajador de los funestos efectos de la inflación creada por las
autoridades monetarias. Pero atacar los síntomas, mientras se le da la
espalda a las verdaderas causas, conduce a mayor desempleo y  desconfianza.
Los obstáculos que impiden mejorar el nivel de vida del venezolano son
principalmente nuestra pésima a legislación laboral, el  inmenso peso del
aparato gubernamental y la constante emisión de dinero inorgánico para tapar
huecos presupuestarios. Tan espectacular es la catástrofe económica que
sufrimos que se comienza a generar presión popular por adelgazar al Estado,
por exigir eficacia a los políticos y burócratas, por cambiar leyes que
impiden la inversión, por reformar los corrompidos sistemas públicos de
seguridad social y de administración de justicia. Lamentablemente, la
probabilidad que se instrumenten reformas adecuadas en el exageradamente
politizado ámbito laboral es ínfima.<p>
Una de las aberraciones de la ley laboral venezolana concierne el pago de la
antigüedad. Por cada año de empleo, el trabajador se hace acreedor al
equivalente de un mes de salario, monto que se hace efectivo cuando se
retira de la empresa, pero que constantemente se recalcula en base al último
sueldo. Así, todo aumento de salario tiene un efecto retroactivo. En tiempos
de inflación esta deuda de las empresas se dispara de tal manera que obliga
a los patronos a deshacerse de sus empleados más veteranos, con la inmensa
pérdida de productividad que ello acarrea para la economía.
Al gobierno, por el contrario, no le importa acumular pasivos que
administraciones futuras tendrán que pagar y por ello, aunque emplea al 20%
de los venezolanos, el sector público acumula 66% del pasivo por
prestaciones sociales.<p>
La situación se agrava si el retiro ocurre por decisión del patrono y no del
trabajador, no importan las razones; entonces la antigüedad se paga doble.
Por ello, un trabajador que tenga 15 años en la empresa y gane $5.000 al
año, despedirlo cuesta $14.000.<p>
La inflexibilidad que estas leyes populistas le han impuesto a la economía
venezolana es motivo importante del empobrecimiento de la nación y del
atraso de nuestra industria, imposibilitada por las autoridades a competir
con el resto del mundo. Pero, los más afectados son los miembros de la misma
clase trabajadora ante la desaparición de ofertas de empleo y por la
imposibilidad de conseguir aumentos de sueldos a medida que sube el costo de
la vida. Eso también explica porque más de la mitad de los venezolanos
laboran en la economía informal, sin ningún tipo de protección social.
A pesar de esta tragedia nacional, los sindicatos, fuerza dominante en
varios de los principales partidos políticos aunque representan sólo a una
muy pequeña parte de los trabajadores, se niegan a aceptar reformas que
impliquen la pérdida de sus "conquistas", insistiendo que los "derechos
adquiridos" de los trabajadores no son negociables. <p>
 	El presidente Caldera y su actual ministro del Trabajo parecen ahora
comprender el problema, pero ellos fueron los autores de la ley promulgada
en 1990, cuando en la oposición utilizaban todas las tradicionales armas de
la demagogia.<p>
Ahora se habla de que la ley se debería aplicar sólo a quienes devengan
hasta 10 salarios mínimos. La verdad es que la situación difícilmente podría
ser peor y día a día se hace más evidente el atraso institucional de
Venezuela vis-a-vis el resto del continente. ©<p>

CUBA: LAS MENTIRAS OFICIALES
</h2>     
Vladimir Chelminski*<BR>
<P>
CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Toda América Latina, excepto Cuba, pudo ver la entrevista
que le hizo Dan Rather a Fidel Castro y el posterior debate sobre la misma
entre Ricardo Alarcón, presidente de la Asamblea del Poder Popular de Cuba y
Jorge Mas Canosa, presidente de la Fundación Nacional Cubano-Americana. La
aseveración del Sr. Alarcón de que el deseo de emigrar a Estados Unidos no
es un fenómeno cubano sino más bien una realidad latinoamericana tiene algo
de verdad. La diferencia es que en Cuba la gente está desesperada por comer
completo, sufre una total falta de libertad y la imposibilidad de soñar en
una vida mejor dentro de su patria.
<P>
Puede ser que muchos de los pobres de América Latina
quisieran emigrar a Estados Unidos, pero no estarían dispuestos a correr los
mismos riesgos. Y mienten las autoridades cubanas cuando aseguran que la
falta de todo en la isla se debe al embargo estadounidense, pues estamos en
la era de las comunicaciones, por lo que es posible importar mercancías de
diferentes orígenes siempre y cuando se pague con moneda dura. La verdadera
causa de la escasez en Cuba es que el socialismo destruyó todo incentivo por
producir e intercambiar.
<P>
Lamentablemente, por toda América Latina campea la miseria, pero también hay
que aclarar que en gran parte ella se debe a la irresponsabilidad individual
que nos ha caracterizado en materia de paternidad, como también a que en
muchos aspectos vitales hemos seguido modelos socialistas no muy diferentes
al cubano.
<P> 
Esferas tan importantes como la educación, la salud, el
transporte, la producción y distribución de energía han sido socializadas
por nuestros gobiernos, los cuales también han tendido a monopolizar la
explotación de nuestras riquezas naturales y de aquellos renglones en los
que gozamos de ventajas comparativas, eliminando así la competencia, sin la
cual no existe eficiencia alguna en la producción ni en la distribución.
<P>
La mayoría de nuestras constituciones fueron redactadas o
enmendadas por simpatizantes de las ideas de Marx y Lenin, las mismas que
inspiraron la revolución castrista. En el resto de América Latina, el estado
no ha sido tan horriblemente cruel y sanguinario, pero a través de una
constante intervención en la vida y el trabajo de los ciudadanos también ha
logrado retrasar nuestro desarrollo y nuestra habilidad de competir en el
mundo moderno.
<P>
Los cubanos prefieren emigrar a Estados Unidos, pero en su
defecto lo harían gustosamente a  cualquier otro país del hemisferio
occidental, mientras que nadie en su sano juicio intentaría jamás emigrar a
Cuba, a menos de que sea perseguido por la justicia.
<P>
El respeto a los derechos de propiedad, que son la base de
la prosperidad y seguridad en Estados Unidos, fue el principal objetivo
atacado frontalmente por la Revolución Cubana. La propiedad no es muy
respetada tampoco por la mayoría de los políticos latinoamericanos, quienes
se aprestan a rechazar la Ley Helms-Burton, la cual pretende impedir que se
trafique con propiedades de ciudadanos estadounidenses que la revolución
confiscó, sin compensación alguna.
<P>
Sobre expropiaciones arbitrarias en América Latina tenemos
una larga y triste experiencia, aunque es pálida frente a la de los cubano.
Como es tan tenue el respeto a la propiedad privada  en América Latina,
nuestros líderes no están en capacidad de entender bien una ley que se
refiere a  propiedades robadas por el estado. El día que el pueblo de Cuba y
del resto de América Latina entienda cabalmente la importancia del concepto
de la propiedad como institución social fundamental que alienta la
administración cuidadosa de recursos escasos, comenzará entonces una
revolución pacífica conducente a la prosperidad, el orden y el amor por la
patria. 
<P>      
Pero está claro que el problema cubano es mucho más
dramático que el del resto de América Latina, a la vez que es insólito que
por todo el continente se desplacen sacerdotes propagando laTeología de la
Liberación, la idea de que una revolución como la cubana  puede ser el
remedio para nuestros males. Es también absurdo que nuestros gobernantes
continúen apoyando la dictadura castrista frente a un país libre como
Estados Unidos. &copy;

<title>VENEZUELA: DESAPARECEN LAS IMPORTACIONES LEGALES -- 11/14/96</title>

<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>VENEZUELA: DESAPARECEN LAS IMPORTACIONES LEGALES
</h2>
Vladimir Chelminski*<br>
<p>
CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El comercio irregular de mercancías importadas, en
particular de los equipos de oficina, médicos, de sonido y vídeo, las
neveras, cocinas, lavadoras, etc. alcanza  hoy niveles sin precedentes en
Venezuela. Tan grave es el problema que conocidas empresas multinacionales
como Sony, Panasonic, Hitachi, Compact, Hewlett Packard, Phillips, Epson,
que ofrecen sus productos cumpliendo con todas las leyes, se están
preparando para marcharse y abandonar sus operaciones en el país.
<p>
Por comercio irregular me refiero a mercancías de contrabando que no pagan
aranceles que promedian 20%, bienes robados o utilizados como pretexto para
lavar dinero proveniente del tráfico internacional de estupefacientes,
también artículos de segunda mano que son vendidos como nuevos o
comercializados evadiendo el IVA de 16,5%, impuesto que en ciertos renglones
llega hasta 36,5%.  Este mercado negro que se ha disparado en Venezuela este
año atenta contra la viabilidad del comercio establecido y muchos de los
compradores no tienen idea de la procedencia de lo que adquieren ni
sospechan la posibilidad de futuros problemas, en cuanto a calidad y
garantías de servicio y repuestos.
<p>
Con la progresiva desaparición de los representantes y distribuidores
legítimos de esas marcas tiende también a desaparecer el personal entrenado
para cumplir con la garantía y reparación de bienes costosos, como
computadoras y televisores, a la vez que la ciudadanía se va acostumbrando
tanto a la corrupción oficial como al incumplimiento de la ley, aceptando la
evidente ausencia de seguridad jurídica.
<p>
Según estadísticas presentadas por el Consejo Nacional del Comercio y los
Servicios, las ventas al detal durante el primer semestre de este año
cayeron en Venezuela 50%, comparadas con el mismo semestre del año pasado;
la venta de vehículos cayó en 65% y la venta de alimentos se redujo en 35%.
No se conoce la proporción de esas ventas que ahora se realizan en la
economía informal.
<p>
La Cámara de Comercio de Caracas apoya la reforma de las aduanas anunciada
por las autoridades porque suele tomar 10 a 15 días retirar mercancías de
los puertos venezolanos. La reforma apunta a la simplificación y aceleración
de los trámites. Se oponen los que hoy viven  del robo de mercancías
almacenadas en los puertos y de la extorsión a los importadores para
agilizar complicados y anticuados trámites oficiales.
<p>
Cuando Transparency International, prestigiosa institución alemana,
cataloga a Venezuela reiteradamente como uno de los países más corruptos de
América Latina y del mundo, lo hace principalmente por la mala fama de
nuestro sistema judicial y de nuestras aduanas. Cuatro veces han fracasado
los intentos de reformar el sistema aduanal venezolano en los últimos cuatro
años, lo cual es indicativo del poder político y económico de sus
opositores. La reforma anunciada comenzará con un plan piloto en la aduana
marítima de La Guaira y se espera sea pronto extendida al resto de los
puertos y aeropuertos venezolanos.
<p>
Esta reforma es un primer paso para eliminar el contrabando que debe ser
seguido de la rebaja y unificación de impuestos, a todas luces excesivos. El
bienestar nacional reclama la unificación de aranceles en alrededor de 7% y
del IVA en 10%. El Fisco recaudará mucho más cobrando 7% sobre todas las
importaciones que cobrando 20% de las que hoy cumplen con la ley. Y quienes
hoy se arriesgan pagando sobornos para evitar el pago tanto del IVA como de
los aranceles difícilmente continuarían haciéndolo con impuestos razonables.
<p>
Otra fuente de fraude y corrupción es el puerto libre de la isla de
Margarita, donde se  conceden privilegios a determinados ciudadanos que le
son negados a todos los demás. No sólo los residentes de Margarita necesitan
incentivos. Incentivos también requieren los que han invertido a través de
los años en establecer sus marcas y el buen nombre de sus establecimientos
comerciales, ofreciendo el buen servicio de su personal entrenado y precios
competitivos para su clientela. Son estos los comerciantes que por la
ignorancia económica y poca visión de legisladores y funcionarios están
desapareciendo. ©

<h2>
REFORMA ELECTORAL
</h2>

Edward H. Crane*
<p>

WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Uno de los temas más importantes -y peor entendidos- que
enfrenta Estados Unidos es la reforma electoral. La reforma de las leyes que
rigen el financiamiento de las campañas choca de frente con la más popular
de las reformas propuestas, la que busca asignar un límite a las veces que
un congresista puede ser reelegido.
<dd>	El intento de reformar el financiamiento de las campañas, de la manera como
ha sido recientemente presentado en el Congreso, es más bien una solución en
búsqueda de un problema. Las críticas de que estamos gastando cantidades
"obscenas" en las elecciones no tienen base en la realidad. En Estados
Unidos gastamos menos de $10 por elector en cada ciclo de dos años para cada
cargo en el país, desde atrapador de perros callejeros a presidente de la
nación.
<dd>	Dado el inmenso impacto que los funcionarios electos tienen en nuestras
vidas y en nuestros bolsillos, se puede más bien argumentar que no estamos
gastando lo suficiente. Eso es particularmente cierto si reconocemos que el
dinero es lo que nos permite ser informados durante las campañas. Herbert
Alexander, director de Citizens Research Foundation lo explica de la
siguiente manera: "Los gastos en las campañas deben ser considerados como lo
que pagamos para ser educados sobre los temas políticos. Las campañas más
costosas resultan ser aquellas donde los electores hacen una mala selección
por falta de información".
<dd>	Es obvio que los límites que se tratan de imponer a los gastos en las
campañas electorales de los congresistas beneficia a los miembros actuales y
perjudica a desconocidos que aspiran reemplazarlos.
Por el contrario, aquellos que intentan limitar las reelecciones de los
congresistas buscan abrir el proceso político. Ellos quieren que sus
conciudadanos que viven y trabajan en el mundo real, lejos de Washington,
vayan a la capital como sus representantes, por tiempo limitado, en lugar de
los políticos profesionales que favorecen las propuestas de limitar el
financiamiento de las campañas.
<dd>La limitación de las reelecciones combinado a la total transparencia e
información sobre las contribuciones recibidas por los candidatos
conformarían una verdadera reforma. Ello permitiría que gente competente,
con las más diferentes posiciones, pudiesen recolectar suficientes fondos
para participar como candidatos en el proceso político, aún cuando hayan
pasado la mayor parte de sus vidas en el sector privado, como el resto de
nosotros.
<dd>                Como resultado tendríamos una democracia más vigorosa, con
la participación de candidatos con los más variados antecedentes y
experiencias, tomando parte en elecciones más competitivas.
En 1968, Eugene McCarthy pudo lanzar su candidatura a la presidencia porque
unos pocos opositores a la guerra en Vietnam, con mucho dinero,
contribuyeron cientos de miles de dólares a su campaña. Si los actuales
límites a las contribuciones hubieran estado entonces vigentes, los millones
de ciudadanos opuestos a la guerra no hubieran tenido un vocero y Lyndon
Johnson hubiera ido a la reelección. No es el papel de las leyes electorales
cambiar la historia.
<dd>                Como el Sr. McCarthy sostuvo: "Nuestros próceres de la
independencia arriesgaron 'sus vidas, sus fortunas y su sagrado honor en la
batalla por la libertad'. No dijeron 'sus vidas y sus fortunas hasta $1000'".&copy

<title>PARAGUAY: DEFORESTACION Y  POPULISMO -- 11/14/96</title>

<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>PARAGUAY: DEFORESTACION Y  POPULISMO
</h2>
Porfirio Cristaldo A.*<br>
<p>
ASUNCION (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- La depredación del bosque nativo en el Paraguay avanza a
ritmo pavoroso. Su total desaparición se estima entre 5 y 7 años. Miles de
hectáreas boscosas son segadas diariamente e hileras de camiones cargados de
troncos cruzan las fronteras sin pausa, pese a las leyes ambientales que
proscriben la tala de árboles y prohiben su exportación. 
<p>
Los legisladores reprochan al gobierno por la masiva destrucción de
los bosques, el tráfico ilegal de madera y la creciente contaminación de
ríos y arroyos. Exigen el acatamiento de las leyes ambientales, proponen
crear un Ministerio del Medio Ambiente y sancionar leyes más estrictas, con
elevadas multas y penas carcelarias para los infractores. Pero la
experiencia mundial muestra su equivocación. No son más leyes, ni penas más
duras, ni más burócratas lo que se precisa para conservar los bosques, sino
proteger la propiedad privada. Paradójicamente, fue el populismo de la
Legislatura en los últimos años lo que aceleró la deforestación. Toda
nuestra legislación atenta contra el bosque.
<p>
        Las leyes de la Reforma Agraria califican al bosque como "latifundio
improductivo", sujeto a expropiación confiscatoria para su posterior reparto
a campesinos "sin tierra". Supuestamente, los bosques no satisfacen la
"función social" de la propiedad. Y por ello los propietarios buscan
deshacerse de sus bosques transformándolos en pastos para el ganado. Por el
apuro, ante la amenaza de expropiación, las maderas se queman en el
desmonte, sin importar la pérdida de materiales de construcción, postes para
cercados y leña. 
<p>
        Pero el peligro no es sólo de expropiación; también está la invasión
de los "sin tierra", entre los que hay verdaderos "industriales" de la
deforestación y el abigeo. Estos invaden únicamente los bosques, y no
precisamente por su fertilidad, sino porque constituyen una fuente inmediata
de ingresos. La primera actividad de los "sin tierra" es la tala del bosque
y venta de troncos. Buena parte del contrabando maderero financia las
invasiones de tierras y en muchos casos constituyen el único interés de los
"sin tierra". No es fácil sobrevivir en regiones remotas esperando la venta
de las primeras cosechas. Los invasores talan y se van.
<p>
        Para el propietario, la mejor defensa contra la invasión de sus
tierras es la deforestación, eliminando su principal atractivo. El
formidable costo de derribar y quemar la selva se justifica aún más por el
hecho que el bosque no sirve de mucho, pues las leyes ambientales intentan
"protegerlo" de su dueño. 
<p>
        Al propietario le está prohibido cortar sus árboles y venderlos sin
previa autorización del Ministerio de Agricultura, ajustándose a un Plan de
Explotación forestal. Para el dueño, esta restricción le resta valor al
bosque. A nadie le interesa cuidar o preservar un recurso cuyo uso el
gobierno puede disponer arbitrariamente. Mejor no tener bosques. Las leyes
de protección ambiental se suman así a los peligros de la invasión y
fomentan una rápida deforestación. El gobierno activamente destruye lo que
pretende proteger. 
<p>
        Las restricciones a la exportación, rezago de la fracasada "teoría
de la dependencia" que consideraba imprescindible exportar bienes con "valor
agregado", limita, a su vez, el valor de los troncos al pequeño mercado
interno. Liberalizar la exportación eliminaría el contrabando y elevaría el
precio de la madera al nivel internacional. ¿Acaso esto aumentaría la
deforestación? No. Los bajos precios actuales destruyen el interés de
preservar el bosque y eliminan toda inversión en reforestar. El aumento del
precio de la madera incentivaría su conservación y eficiente explotación.  
<p>
        En una economía libre es el propietario el más interesado en
preservar sus bosques. Incluso hoy, las depredaciones más severas las sufren
los Parques Nacionales, que al ser de todos no son de nadie. Intensificar
las regulaciones y controles como proponen legisladores y burócratas
paraguayos no sólo agravará la deforestación sino también el desempleo y la
miseria. 
<p>
        Los bosques nativos, alrededor del 10% del territorio paraguayo,
deberían declararse por ley "no aptos" para la reforma agraria. Frenar la
deforestación requiere derogar las leyes ambientales y las restricciones al
comercio de troncos, restableciendo la propiedad privada. Nadie mejor que su
dueño cuida lo suyo. ©

<TITLE>Falcoff: LatinoAmerica Vista Desde Washington -- 8/7/96</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY  bgcolor="#FFFFFF"background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>LATINOAMERICA VISTA DESDE WASHINGTON</H2>
Mark Falcoff*<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Para América Latina, las noticias de nuestra campaña
presidencial son buenas y malas. Por segunda vez, en muchos años, el tópico
de la región no es decisivo, pero a la vez no hay razones particulares para
que los latinoamericanos teman, deseen la victoria o la derrota de uno de
los candidatos.
<dd>
Se trata de un viejo problema en las relaciones hemisféricas. Estados
Unidos es criticado por tomarlos demasiado en cuenta ("intervenir") o por
abandonar a América Latina. En esta ocasión la ausencia de debate sobre
América Latina podría verse como una señal positiva, por haberse alcanzado
un consenso respecto a la región en cuanto a "democracia, libre mercado y
mayor intercambio comercial".
<dd>
Pero quedan asuntos pendientes. El primero es la expansión del TLC/NAFTA.
Chile ya debería pertenecer. Esa era la intención de la administración
Clinton hasta que colapsó el peso mexicano. Mientras México no se recupere
económicamente (y vuelva a consumir inmensas cantidades de productos
estadounidenses) será difícil que algún presidente de este país arriesgue
capital político haciendo avanzar el proceso de integración.
<dd>
Los latinoamericanos están sorprendidos de lo sucedido con Chile, país que
ha debido preceder a México. Pero para la mayoría de estadounidenses México
representa el hemisferio; pocos han ido más al sur. Los fracasos de México
han sido proyectados a toda la región. Eso es injusto y por ello Brasil y
Argentina tendrán que esperar entre cuatro y ocho años. Lo positivo es que
ello ha ayudado a acelerar la integración regional. La próxima vez que un
presidente de Estados Unidos decida patrocinar a un nuevo miembro del
TLC/NAFTA bien podría ser Mercosur.
<dd>
El único candidato antilatinoamericano fue Pat Buchanan en las primarias
republicanas, quien ganó en apenas un estado. Aunque las corrientes
contrarias al libre comercio persisten en ambos partidos, la tendencia es
favorable a América Latina.
<dd>
El asunto de las drogas es más conflictivo, pero esto tampoco cambiará
mucho según el ocupante de la Casa Blanca. El argumento de la legalización,
elocuentemente presentado por personas con las más variadas posiciones
políticas, no ha calado. Y la controversia encuentra su centro de gravedad
en el proceso de certificación, a través del cual el Departamento de Estado
cumple con el ritual anual de informar al Congreso y al presidente sobre las
naciones latinoamericanas que están haciendo todo lo posible para combatir
la producción y el despacho de drogas ilegales. No hay que ser muy cínico
para dudar que ese proceso de certificación tenga algo que ver con el mundo
real.
<dd>
Andrés Oppenheimer lo explica muy bien en su último libro. Poco antes de
las elección de Zedillo, la policía federal mexicana incautó 8½ toneladas en
un jet Caravelle que hizo un aterrizaje de emergencia. Seis toneladas
desaparecieron y parte de los mismos paquetes fueron incautados por las
autoridades de Estados Unidos en la frontera. Aparentemente, el decomiso de
2½ toneladas fue cantidad suficiente para ganarle a México la certificación
ese año. Es una decisión significativa ante la descertificación de Colombia
y la suspensión de la visa al presidente Samper, lo cual ha sido
profundamente traumático para los colombianos, ya que la descertificación
conlleva modestas pero altamente simbólicas sanciones comerciales.
<dd>
La tercera cuestión pendiente es la inmigración, algo muy complejo y
emocional. Algunas naciones dependen del dinero que remiten desde Estados
Unidos a familiares. No es probable que México, por ejemplo, hubiera
sobrevivido el colapso financiero sin el dinero enviado a familiares desde
aquí. Otro dramático ejemplo es el de la diáspora salvadoreña.
<dd>
La posición latinoamericana respecto a la inmigración es prudente y moral.
Muchos países insisten que la inmigración es un derecho humano universal.
Así piensa México, pero sin respetarle tal derecho a los guatemaltecos. Por
el contrario, la posición de Estados Unidos ha sido irracional y poco
realista. No hay consenso nacional sobre el tema. La Proposición 187 y la
legislación patrocinada por republicanos para negar educación y demás
servicios públicos a niños ilegales son absurdas ante el hecho que el país
no está dispuesto a hacer deportaciones masivas. La tarea es integrar a los
indocumentados, especialmente a sus hijos. Si los costos parecen
prohibitivos ahora, serán mucho mayores en el futuro. El tema, sin embargo,
no ha sido seriamente discutido en la campaña electoral.
<dd>
Indudablemente que el fantasma de la intervención en Haití acosará al
próximo ocupante de la Casa Blanca porque el presidente René Preval no tiene
fuerza para imponer decisiones económicas cruciales. Un mínimo de orden
público depende de la presencia de las fuerzas de la ONU, las cuales se
retirarán en uno o dos años.
<dd>
El PRI bien puede perder las elecciones legislativas en México y, en
cualquier caso, el sistema político mexicano enfrenta cambios fundamentales.
Por otra parte, Castro puede decidir vengarse de la Ley Helms-Burton
lanzando flotillas de balseros si no este verano, el año que viene.
<dd>
Próximamente los estadounidenses tendrán que negociar un nuevo tratado con
Panamá, permitiendo que permanezcan tropas allá. Bajo el Tratado
Carter-Torrijos de 1978, todas las fuerzas militares estadounidenses deben
marcharse antes del fin del siglo. Los panameños que antes estaban ansiosos
de salir de los gringos han decidido ahora que su presencia es una póliza de
seguro que atrae inversiones y capital extranjero. Estados Unidos, por su
parte, tendrá que decidir si quiere la responsabilidad de asegurar la
estabilidad política panameña.
<dd>
En conclusión, habrá mucho en la agenda latinoamericana de la nueva
administración. Quizás es positivo que estos temas no se politicen durante
la campaña. ©

<h2>
LA ARGENTINA DESPUES DE CAVALLO
</h2>     
Mark Falcoff*<P>
<BR>
WASHINGTON  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Pocos funcionarios en la historia de América Latina han
gozado de la reputación internacional -y del poder interno- de Domingo
Cavallo, hasta hace poco ministro de Economía. Con su salida comienza una
nueva era en la política argentina.
<P>
 Durante 5 ó 6 años, el equipo Menem-Cavallo tuvo extraordinario éxito no
sólo en frenar una inflación galopante sino en restaurar la confianza
internacional respecto a la economía argentina. Ello suministró un cojín
político no disfrutado antes por ningún otro gobierno en la Argentina y
Menem al centrar su campaña por la reelección del año pasado en la
estabilidad monetaria logró aumentar en dos puntos, a 51%, su participación
en el voto popular. Hoy, las encuestas señalan una aprobación por Menem de
apenas 20%.
<P>
 ¿Cómo el político más exitoso en la Argentina desde Perón (fundador de su
partido) ha sufrido tan dramática caída en la aprobación popular? La
contestación corta es que los argentinos dan como un hecho la estabilidad
monetaria y ahora tienen prioridades diferentes, como el desempleo que
alcanza marcas sin precedentes. Otros asuntos preocupan también, como el
alto costo de la vida, la criminalidad y un sistema judicial corrupto e
ineficiente. Los argentinos quieren un gobierno más serio, algo
aparentemente imposible para Menem.
<P>
 Rumores de corrupción hacen muy difícil la labor del nuevo ministro de
Economía. La actitud general parece ser que si el gobierno roba y derrocha
los recursos, ¿porqué voy a pagar impuestos? Esta reacción explica en parte
la caída masiva de recursos anunciada por el sucesor de Cavallo, Roque
Fernández, en su primer discurso televisado.
<P>
 El primer reto del pobre Fernández es explicar a los argentinos que el
déficit fiscal es mucho mayor que el anunciado por Cavallo, el cual
alcanzará este año $6.600 millones (un peso = un dólar). Para reducirlo, el ministro 
anunció una serie de nuevos impuestos, la rebaja del ingreso sujeto
al impuesto sobre la renta y la extensión a 65 años para que las mujeres
sean pensionadas. Peor todavía, Fernández anunció aranceles a repuestos y
equipos que reducirán la rentabilidad de muchas de las fábricas modernas.
<P>
 Tales medidas draconianas que reducirán el nivel de vida de la aporreada
clase media se presentan como necesarias en la defensa de la paridad
peso/dólar, pero así sólo podemos esperar más de lo mismo: ningún incremento
en el empleo ni reactivación económica. Por ello muchos peronistas se están
distanciando de Fernández y del presidente Menem.
<P>
 Sin embargo, la oposición sigue dividida. La tradicional oposición al
peronismo ha sido la Unión Cívica Radical, pero los argentinos recuerdan la
hiperinflación sufrida durante la administración del presidente radical Raúl
Alfonsín (1983-1989), la cual lo obligó a renunciar con siete meses de
anticipación al término de su período. Para horror de los radicales,
Alfonsín informó a la prensa en agosto que no había abandonado totalmente la
idea de candidatearse nuevamente.
<P>
 La esperanza radical es el nuevo alcalde de Buenos Aires, donde vive un
tercio de la población del país. Fernando de la Rua, elegido en julio,
disfruta de 63% de aprobación en las encuestas. El fue congresista por más
de 20 años y tiene reputación de hombre decente y honrado, algo raro en la
política argentina. Pero no le gusta arriesgarse ni tomar decisiones
difíciles y será retado por dos miembros del ala izquierda de su partido,
Rodolfo Terragno (actual presidente del partido) y el congresista Federico
Storani.
<P>
 Desde 1993 surgió una tercera fuerza izquierdista con Frepaso, cuyo
candidato presidencial en 1995, José Octavio Bordón, quedó en segundo lugar.
Pero en la elección del alcalde de Buenos Aires obtuvieron resultados
decepcionantes y Bordón anunció su retiro de la política. Frepaso no es un
partido sino una coalición de grupos disimilares unidos en contra del statu
quo y actualmente organiza una serie de apagones, bocinazos y cacerolazos.
 Argentina ha sufrido una caída en su nivel de vida en los últimos dos años
y la oposición comparte el odio hacia Menem, su familia, sus allegados y sus
políticas económicas. La esperanza de que un inmenso influjo de inversiones
extranjeras absorberían el desempleo generado por las privatizaciones no se
ha hecho realidad. No sucedió porque muchos de esos ex empleados públicos no
son capaces de convertirse en trabajadores productivos. Durante 50 años el
objetivo del gobierno fue el pleno empleo aun con el deterioro de los
sueldos. El sistema educacional es obsoleto y no está preparado para formar
trabajadores en la era de la computación.
<P>
 Menem ha sido presidente por siete años, por más tiempo que cualquier otro
excepto Perón. Duerme largas siestas y toma extensas vacaciones en el
exterior. Apenas aparece la oportunidad de un viaje sale con 100
acompañantes. Sin embargo, en el pasado ha sorprendido tanto a amigos como a
enemigos con su capacidad de enfocar y dominar situaciones difíciles. Tendrá
que repetirlo pronto, si es que piensa dejar una buena situación cuando
termine su mandato dentro de tres años. &copy;

<title>¿QUE VA A PASAR EN BRASIL? -- 11/14/96</title>

<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>¿QUE VA A PASAR EN BRASIL?
</h2>
Mark Falcoff*<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- En octubre los brasileños votarán por alcaldes y
miembros de los concejos municipales, siendo estas elecciones la primera
prueba confrontada por Fernando Henrique Cardoso desde que fue electo
presidente hace dos años. También será una indicación de apoyo o rechazo a
su anunciado programa de liberalización y reforma económica.
<P>
Dos hechos ayudan a comprender mejor al Brasil. Uno es su parecido con
Estados Unidos respecto al tamaño, autonomía propia, concentración en sus
asuntos internos, con culturas e idiomas diferentes al resto de América. En
ninguna otra nación latinoamericana se oye a la gente hablar acerca de su
país como un gran poder del futuro. Lo mismo que los estadounidenses, los
brasileños tienen que buscar la manera de reinventar su gobierno.
<p>
A pesar de múltiples problemas, las estadísticas brasileñas son
impresionantes, comenzando con que es la novena economía más grande del
mundo. Su comercio internacional alcanzó casi $80.000 millones en 1995,
colocándolo en el lugar N° 23. Sus recursos naturales son imán de
inversiones extranjeras.
<p>
El tipo de centrismo político representado por Cardoso (culturalmente de
izquierda, pero económicamente ligeramente a la derecha del centro) se
parece algo a la posición del presidente Clinton. No es de extrañar,
entonces, que hayan hecho buena amistad, lo mismo que sus esposas, quienes
son activistas políticas.
<p>
Cardoso a la fecha ha tenido un éxito modesto. Su credibilidad política se
seguirá basando en el éxito del Plan Real que en efecto liga la moneda
brasileña al dólar. También logró la promulgación de la mejor ley protectora
de la propiedad intelectual en la región. Pero las reformas cruciales a los
impuestos, a la asistencia y seguro social siguen esperando laaprobación del
Congreso.
<p>
A lo contrario del resto del hemisferio, el presidente brasileño es
relativamente débil frente a un Congreso extraordinariamente poderoso. Y los
legisladores reflejan fielmente la extrema diversidad de ese inmenso país,
por lo que en ausencia de un partido poderoso y disciplinado es muy difícil
alcanzar el consenso. Además, la nueva Constitución es un documento difícil
que imposibilita la efectividad gubernamental. ¿Qué otra Constitución
reglamenta el tiempo del descanso para tomar café en las industrias? Al
supervisar todo aspecto de la vida económica y social de la nación, requiere
enmiendas constitucionales para cualquier cambio significativo. Hasta que se
logren algunas alteraciones es imposible permitir la participación privada y
extranjera en petróleo, minería, electricidad y telecomunicaciones.
<p>
Los mismos obstáculos se aplican a la eficiencia de los servicios públicos
y a la privatización del Seguro Social. Pero sin esas reformas corre peligro
el Plan Real y un retorno a la hiperinflación liquidaría lo que queda del
poder político de Cardoso, a la vez que tendría catastróficos efectos tanto
para el Brasil como para sus vecinos.
<p>
La salud económica del Brasil en gran medida determina el bienestar, no
sólo de países pequeños como Uruguay y Paraguay, sino también el de naciones
medianas como Argentina, Colombia y Perú. Sólo Venezuela, con sus masivas
reservas petroleras, sobreviviría el colapso de Brasil.
<p>
La importancia económica de Brasil se manifiesta en el éxito de Mercosur,
una área de libre comercio que ya se extiende a Argentina, Paraguay y
Uruguay. Desde el colapso del peso mexicano y la paralización del TLC/NAFTA
hasta Chile ha aplicado para ingresar a Mercosur.
<p>
Pero las instituciones políticas brasileñas se mantienen curiosamente
rezagadas en un país que avanza en otros frentes. Las elecciones municipales
no son determinantes de las políticas nacionales, pero se consideran buen
termómetro del sentimiento nacional. Sin embargo, como lo indica Alexandre
Barros, los votantes que favorecen mayor desregulación y más privatizaciones
pueden castigar a la administración Cardoso por su lentitud en esos campos.
Pero Barros también cree que los electores que quieren mayor intervención
estatal también castigarán a un gobierno que perciben como neoliberal.
"Cara, yo gano", dice Barros, "sello, tu pierdes".
<p>
Es difícil evaluar las tendencias en un país con una sociedad tan diversa y
rudimentaria. Pero a lo contrario de sus vecinos, los brasileños no optan
por soluciones extremistas. Eso le da al Brasil un aire superficial de
calma, aun cuando el crimen se dispara y la brecha entre ricos y pobres
sigue siendo inmensa.
<p>
El verdadero problema es que mientras la comunidad política brasileña no
esté dispuesta a tomar decisiones difíciles acerca de las reformas
económicas, el país puede perder su mínima estabilidad monetaria, de la que
depende tanto su población como sus vecinos. ©

<title>Friedman: HONG KONG VERSUS BUCHANAN -- 5/16/96</title>

<h2>
HONG KONG VERSUS BUCHANAN
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
spanbio
.html">
Milton Friedman*
</a>

<P>
STANFORD, CALIFORNIA (AIPE).- La experiencia de Hong Kong contradice el
falso dogma de Pat Buchanan de que el proteccionismo beneficia a los
trabajadores y promueve el crecimiento económico.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Poco después de la Segunda Guerra, al mismo tiempo que Gran Bretaña
instrumentaba políticas socialistas, una de sus últimas colonias -Hong Kong-
daba un vuelco hacia el total libre mercado, iniciando un experimento
ilustrativo de los resultados opuestos producidos por el mercado libre y el
mercado controlado.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Por algún accidente de carácter oficial, la oficina colonial británica
designó a John Cowperthwaite, un escocés estudioso de Adam Smith, como
secretario financiero de Hong Kong. A las políticas de libre mercado de
Cowperthwaite se les acredita haber producido el milagro económico que
condujo a un fenomenal crecimiento del nivel de vida promedio, a pesar de
que la población se multiplicó diez veces.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es difícil concebir un reto más severo a las políticas de libre mercado.
Hong Kong es una isla pobre en recursos naturales más allá de su gran
puerto. Cuando los comunistas se adueñaron de China, olas de refugiados
llegaban huyendo sólo con las posesiones que podían cargar. Ellos y los que
los siguieron produjeron un rápido incremento de la población. Hong Kong
prácticamente no recibió ayuda extranjera para asimilar a estas hordas de
refugiados.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Frente a estas adversas circunstancias, la salvación de Hong Kong han sido
sus políticas de libre comercio y libre mercado, basados en ningún arancel a
las importaciones ni ningún subsidio u otro tipo de privilegio concedido a
las exportaciones. Las muy pocas restricciones que se han impuesto, como el
acuerdo sobre textiles multifibras, se deben a presiones aplicadas por
Estados Unidos y algunos otros países. Pero no se fijan los precios ni los
salarios; hay mínimas restricciones al inicio de actividades comerciales y
tanto los gastos del gobierno como los impuestos se han mantenido bajos. La
tasa tope del impuesto personal a las rentas es 25%, con un promedio máximo
de 15%.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Las condiciones eran tétricas al principio, pero rápidamente comenzaron a
mejorar y han seguido mejorando hasta hoy. Para 1960, el Producto Interno
Bruto per cápita (en precios de 1995) era de $2.247, o sea menos de una
tercera parte del de Gran Bretaña entonces, que era de $7.906. Para 1994 la
situación se había revertido. El ingreso per cápita en Hong Kong se había
multiplicado casi por ocho, hasta alcanzar $17.832 y era ya 30% superior al
de Gran Bretaña, el cual alcanzaba $13.340. Realmente un milagro económico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es irónico que la colonia floreció, a pesar de todas las circunstancias
adversas, al seguir políticas diametralmente opuestas a la de su madre
patria, mientras Inglaterra permanecía estancada. El Instituto Fraser del
Canadá acaba de publicar una clasificación, según la libertad económica, de
más de cien países en 1995. Hong Kong está en primer puesto; Estados Unidos
en el cuarto y Gran Bretaña en el sexto. Más sorprendente aún es que el
ingreso per cápita de Hong Kong es apenas 5% más bajo que el de Estados Unidos.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Qué contraste con la experiencia de casi todas las ex colonias británicas
que obtuvieron su libertad después de la Segunda Guerra. Y qué estupenda
prueba de que el libre comercio y el libre mercado favorecen mucho más a la
gente común y corriente que el "proteccionismo" del Sr. Buchanan o el "justo
intercambio" del presidente Clinton. La "justicia comercial" depende de
quién la mire, mientras que el veredicto del libre comercio está en manos
del mercado. Por algo la palabra "libre" aparece mencionada tres veces en
nuestra Declaración de Independencia y una vez en la primera enmienda
constitucional, al igual que la palabra "libertad". Pero la palabra "justo"
no aparece en ninguno de esos documentos redactados por nuestros próceres.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Lamentablemente, el milagro de Hong Kong va a ser seriamente dañado si no
destruido cuando los comunistas le pongan la mano el año próximo.

<h2>
VENEZUELA Y LA PRIVATIZACION
</h2>

Oscar García M.*
<p>

CARACAS <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Para que en Venezuela podamos vivir en un Estado de
derecho, con una economía libre de mercado, el gobierno debe despojarse de
las empresas industriales, comerciales y bancarias. En sus manos no
funcionan y producen pérdidas en lugar de beneficios.
<dd>	Un reciente estudio indica que entre 1970 y 1995 se realizaron
transferencias fiscales de alrededor de cien mil millones de dólares a las
empresas estatales de Guayana (acero, aluminio y energía eléctrica). La
magnitud de esa cifra supera nuestra capacidad de comprensión. Pero si
hacemos sólo dos comparaciones nos daremos cuenta de su dimensión. La
capitalización bursátil, de la totalidad de las compañías que se cotizan en
la Bolsa de Valores de Caracas, a mayo de 1996, es de cinco mil   millones
de dólares, aproximadamente. O sea, que con esos cien mil millones de
dólares se hubiesen podido comprar 20 veces todas las acciones de todas las
compañías inscritas (las de Venezolana de Cementos, La Electricidad de
Caracas, Banco Provincial, Sivensa, Manpa, Mantex, etc.). Insólito, ¿no es
verdad?
<dd>	Otra comparación: al cierre de abril de 1996, la totalidad de los depósitos
en los bancos, tanto públicos como privados, ascendía a 6.945 mil millones
de dólares. Esos cien mil millones en transferencias equivalen a más de 14
veces los depósitos de la banca venezolana.
<dd>	Y, ¿en qué se invirtieron? Pues en empresas que hoy día muy poco valen
(pues sus pérdidas son inmensas y su ineficiencia proverbial), pero
sirvieron y sirven para algo mucho más importante, apoyar al sistema de
privilegios, favores, dádivas y quién sabe cuántas cosas más en que se basa
el sistema político venezolano.
<dd>	Al privatizarse esas empresas que los políticos denominan "básicas y
estratégicas" casi como por acto de magia desaparecerán las transferencias
y, más importante aún, se comenzará a tener un grupo de empresas productivas
y se estimulará el mercado de capitales.
<dd>	Este punto es de especial importancia. En Venezuela no hay medios
suficientes de canalización de los ahorros. Si hoy fuera aprobada una Ley de
Fondo de Pensiones similar a la instituida en Chile hace 15 años, con gran
éxito y en beneficio de los trabajadores, habría mucha dificultad en poder
colocar esos fondos en el sector privado y podría el gobierno con facilidad
caer en la tentación de absorberlos para continuar financiando sus déficit.
<dd>	Un ejemplo de la bondad de la inversión en privatizaciones: recientemente
el Sunday Times de Londres publicó un reportaje donde analiza las
privatizaciones inglesas y afirma que si alguien invirtió 1.000 libras
esterlinas en cada una de las 20 mayores privatizaciones, tendría hoy día
una cartera con un valor de 140.000 libras esterlinas. Lo cual es una muy
buena ganancia. El promedio de retorno de las compañías privatizadas es de
599%, que supera al promedio del Financial Times que fue para el mismo
período de 354%.
<dd>	La privatización es buena para todos, pero resulta muy difícil superar los
obstáculos políticos y aún más los personales y partidistas de sus
opositores. Poco a poco la opinión pública impulsará esos cambios.&copy

<TITLE>Garcia: VeNezuela: Petroleo y Miseria -- 8/7/96</TITLE>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>VENEZUELA: PETROLEO Y MISERIA</H2>
Oscar García M.*<p>
CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Hace sólo 14 años, en 1982, el venezolano que tenía un
billete de 500 bolívares en el bolsillo podía cambiarlo en cualquier banco
por $116,28. Ahora ese mismo billete de 500 bolívares apenas vale $1,05,
menos de cien veces. Este proceso de devaluación e inflación resulta
inexplicable en un país dotado de una riqueza petrolera casi sin fin. El
petróleo no fue sembrado, como hace 60 años propuso hacer Arturo Uslar
Pietri, en un editorial del diario Ahora. Por el contrario ha sido utilizado
para subsidiar las crisis.
<dd>
No hemos logrado con los ingresos del petróleo construir una economía
moderna y productiva. Al contrario, al haber sido manejados los recursos
petroleros por el Estado, se han malbaratado y despilfarrado de tal manera
que la Venezuela de hoy puede ser definida con dos palabras contrapuestas:
"petróleo y miseria".
<dd>
Siguen ingresando cantidades asombrosas de dinero provenientes de las
exportaciones petroleras -para este año más de $20.000 millones-, lo cual
sería más que suficiente para 23 millones de habitantes que sólo importan
bienes y servicios por alrededor de $8.000 millones. Pero el  nivel de
pobreza alcanza  80% de la población. Un absurdo imperdonable.
<dd>
El Estado recibe los ingresos y en lugar de utilizarlos para sentar las
bases de un crecimiento sostenido, los despilfarra en una enorme burocracia
ineficiente, una industria estatizada y un aparato clientelar.
<dd>
Aunque los ingresos petroleros serían más que suficientes para cubrir las
necesidades financieras del gobierno, a nuestros políticos les resultan
insuficientes y el Estado recurre al incremento en los impuestos para cubrir
infinitas necesidades. Los impuestos son un mal necesario, pues destruyen
riqueza, extinguen incentivos y deben ser siempre usados para gastos
estrictamente necesarios: la seguridad (que no hay), justicia (casi
inexistente), defensa, relaciones internacionales, educación y salud.
<dd>
En casi todos esos rubros los gobiernos venezolanos no han sido capaces de
prestar servicios razonables; al contrario, han hecho colapsar algunos que
en su momento fueron tolerables.
<dd>
Ahora, cuando el mundo entero está de regreso y ha sido ampliamente
comprobado que las altas tasas impositivas, en lugar de aumentar, reducen
los ingresos fiscales, se empeña nuestro gobierno en aumentar fuertemente
las cargas a una población ya exhausta.
<dd>
El impuesto inflacionario que ha azotado a los venezolanos entre 1976 y
1995 es de 9.494%. El impuesto inflacionario desde 1994 a mayo de 1996 es de
288,59%. La inflación genera una transferencia de riquezas tremendamente
injusta, especialmente de los más débiles y pobres al gobierno. Los más
ricos se protegen de la inflación con inversiones inmobiliarias y cuentas en
el extranjero.
<dd>
Los ingresos petroleros de Venezuela han continuado aumentando y por
diversas circunstancias seguirán haciéndolo, facilitando a los políticos
postergar reformas estructurales fundamentales y necesarias, como lo son la
creación del Estado de derecho y las esencialísimas privatizaciones. 
<dd>
La voluntad política para realizar cambios estructurales bajo la anunciada
Agenda Venezuela ya comienza a flaquear, según el propio ministro de
Planificación Teodoro Petkoff. De ser así, la Venezuela del futuro seguirá
siendo la misma de hoy: mucho petróleo y mucha miseria.
<dd>
Para cambiar y prosperar -y puede lograrse esto con relativa rapidez- es
necesario reducir el tamaño del Estado privatizando, dejando en manos de la
iniciativa privada el manejo del aparato productivo del país. Este proceso,
aparentemente traumático para quienes han vivido tantos años bajo ambientes
populistas e intervencionistas, es la solución tanto de corto como de largo
plazo, que permitirá bajar la inflación, crear empleos y desarrollar la
productividad, devolviéndole así a la nación venezolana su optimismo y
bienestar. ©

COLERA Y EL IMPERIALISMO SANITARIO

<P>
LIMA (AIPE).- En enero de 1991 se declaró una epidemia de cólera en el Perú
que le costó la vida a cerca de 20.000 personas en cinco años y afectó a
otras 310.000. La epidemia se propagó por 14 países del continente americano
hasta llegar a convertirse, según la Organización Mundial de la Salud, en la
séptima pandemia más letal de este siglo.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Pese a su virulencia, las causas de esta epidemia han estado rodeadas de
un sospechoso misterio. Generalmente se asocian con la ingestión de pescado
contaminado en algunos puertos peruanos del Pacífico, específicamente
Chimbote y Chancay, donde empezó la epidemia. Se señalan como causas también
la insuficiencia de servicios de agua potable y defectos en la red que la
provee.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Ello no obstante, las más recientes investigaciones revelan un hecho
aterrador. Al parecer, la causa del cólera fue la reducción de la cantidad
de cloro en el agua dispuesta por el gobierno peruano como consecuencia de
los consejos de la Agencia de Protección Ambiental de Estados Unidos (EPA,
por sus siglas en inglés).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Según un informe de la Organización Panamericana de la Salud,
aparentemente se habría reducido a 0,2 miligramos por litro la cantidad de
cloro que los acueductos peruanos añadían al agua. El promedio internacional
ponderado es de 0,3 miligramos por litro. Como el Perú no se encuentra en la
media de salubridad y su infraestructura sanitaria es deficiente, el nivel
óptimo hubiera estado más bien entre 0,35 y 0,4 miligramos por litro. Sin
embargo, como los grupos ecológicos han persuadido a la EPA de que el cloro
causa cáncer, especialmente cuando se descompone en trialometanos al
contacto con materia orgánica, la autoridades estadounidenses recomiendan
una reducción del cloro.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Tratando de colocarse a la vanguardia de la tecnología, los burócratas
peruanos habrían seguido la recomendación de los ambientalistas durante
1990, creando una reducción de la barrera química contra las enfermedades en
el agua potable, de suerte que en enero de 1991 se declaró la epidemia.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Aparentemente lo que sucedió fue que los funcionarios peruanos quisieron
ponerse en la moda ecológica y convirtieron en "verde" el agua potable. Pero
era el verde de la contaminación. El verde del cólera. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Se trata, pues, de una lamentable y trágica negligencia que va a dar lugar
a múltiples escándalos. De hecho existe una inexcusable irresponsabilidad de
los funcionarios peruanos que mancha con un crimen más al gobierno de Alan
García. Pero es también cierto que la responsabilidad de las autoridades
norteamericanas se hace inocultable, al extremo de abrirse posibilidades de
que los familiares de los muertos por el cólera enjuicien al gobierno
norteamericano para conseguir una justa indemnización.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La EPA se convertiría así en responsable de uno de los genocidios más
grandes de la historia del continente americano; el cual, vista la
persistente campaña que ella hace para suprimir el cloro del agua en Estados
Unidos y otros países del mundo, se convierte en una trágica advertencia. La
comunidad internacional no puede permitir que la demagogia y la
irresponsabilidad ecologista destruyan los precarios logros de la salubridad
pública.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Este caso es, ciertamente, una tragedia, pero enseña cómo las inadecuadas
recomendaciones de los ecologistas pueden hacer daño, al extremo de condenar
a muerte a decenas de miles de personas. Los prejuicios ideológicos pueden
convertirse fácilmente en armas letales cuando se convierten en regulaciones
públicas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Probablemente el cloro tiene ciertos riesgos, pero un análisis de
costo/beneficio no puede hacerse en este caso entre el cáncer y el no cáncer
solamente, sino entre el cáncer y el cólera. No vaya a ser que por pretender
alcanzar un futuro "políticamente correcto" regresemos al más aterrador de
los pasados.

<h2>
MANUAL DE IDIOTAS
</h2>

Enrique Ghersi*
<p>

LIMA <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Todo empezó en el bar del hotel don Pancho de Benidorm, en el
sur de España. Las Primeras Jornadas Liberales Iberoamericanas organizadas
en España por el peruano Fernando Iwasaki habían convocado a un grupo de
intelectuales para discutir sobre la situación de la libertad en el mundo.
Al final de los debates, cuando un grupo liderado por Plinio Apuleyo
Mendoza, Carlos Alberto Montaner y Alvaro Vargas Llosa miraba la televisión,
el noticiero dio cuenta de que el futbolista argentino Diego Maradona, de
visita en Cuba, se había proclamado admirador y partidario acérrimo de Fidel
Castro.
<dd>	Apenas se informó de ello, Plinio estalló en furia. Carlos Alberto calculó,
casi de inmediato, los millones de dólares que Maradona podía haberse
embolsado con este golpe de efecto. Y Alvaro, más agresivo aún, sostuvo la
necesidad de despegar de inmediato una campaña internacional dirigida a
denunciar los excesos de la intelligentsia latinoamericana, en el supuesto
asaz dudoso de que el futbolista la integrase.
<dd>	La primera vez que oí la frase fue cuando, hastiado ya por la indignación,
Montaner sostuvo que el futbolista era el prototipo del "idiota
latinoamericano". Esa especie de bípedo impune capaz de sostener sin el
menor reparo la verdad de perogrullo o trivialidad de moda, a cambio de
aparentar ser una persona informada y seria.
<dd>	Hoy los tres escritores nos ofrecen una versión, polémica y apasionada de
este problema con su "Manual del Perfecto Idiota Latinoamericano" que,
publicado por Plaza & Janes, acaba de ser presentado en diferentes capitales
del continente por una gira trashumante de los autores.
<dd>	La intelectualidad latinoamericana ha estado influenciada por los
arquetipos. Renunciando a su creatividad y no queriendo ver sus indudables
aportes, el típico intelectual de nuestro continente es aquel que se conduce
por la moda europea, al abrigo del temperamento norteamericano y con la
reminiscencia étnica suficiente. Este personaje recorre nuestra historia sin
el menor interés por la realidad. Sólo se fija en el prejuicio, generalmente
el suyo propio, sentenciando a cada rato una media verdad en torno de la
cual construye un conjunto de falsas proposiciones.
<dd>	Domina la sociología. Sabe antropología y economía. Escribe versos y es
oportunista. Nuestro idiota es un personaje admirado y temido. Su opinión
predomina en los círculos académicos, resulta apreciada en los políticos y
remunerada en los empresariales. Todo perfectamente contradictorio con su
presumida modestia. Hace ya tiempo que se necesitaba un detenido estudio de
tan notable fenómeno.
<dd>	El "Manual" es un libro de combate, llamado a crear polémica y a refutar
-con sarcasmo y aguda crítica- los lugares comunes y las verdades de
perogrullo más usuales de la intelectualidad latinoamericana.
<dd>	Primero cataloga errores. Luego los formaliza, exponiéndolos suscintamente
a fin de refutarlos a continuación. Posteriormente derriba mitos sin dejar
títere con cabeza, incluidos Gustavo Gutiérrez, Eduardo Galleano y José
Carlos Mariátegui. Finalmente, con gran ironía, presenta los diez libros más
leídos por el "idiota" y una impresionante galería de medias verdades, por
la que desfilan frases de lo más graneado de nuestras elites, incluidos
Mario Vargas Llosa y los tres mismos autores.
<dd>	En síntesis, se trata de un libro polémico fundamental para el liberalismo
finisecular en Iberoamérica que rescata, de la clásica idea del panfleto, la
indignación y la ironía como argumentos retóricos de la libertad.&copy

<h2>
MALAS COPIAS DEL SISTEMA CHILENO DE PENSIONES
</h2>

Mary Anastasia O'Grady*
<p>

SANTIAGO DE CHILE <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Cuando el "efecto tequila" hizo estragos en
América Latina en 1995 y se retiraron capitales de la región, Chile fue poco
afectado. Eso se debió en parte a su alta tasa de ahorro interno de
alrededor de 27% del PIB.
<dd>	En gran parte tan alta tasa de ahorro se debe a la reforma del sistema de
pensiones promulgado en 1980 e iniciado en 1981. Una vez que a los chilenos
se les dio el control sobre sus ahorros para el retiro, opciones sobre la
administración e incentivos para retirarse del sistema público de pensiones,
la privatización tomó vuelo. Así comenzó el auge del ahorro que hizo
prosperar el mercado local de capitales.
<dd>	La reforma del Seguro Social chileno tuvo tanto éxito que las naciones
vecinas que sufren de bajas tasas de ahorro comenzaron a copiárselo. Pero
por razones parroquianas el modelo chileno ha sido modificado en todas
partes, modificaciones que han debilitado los resultados. Aunque los
trabajadores de esos países se han estado cambiando a sistemas de pensiones
privados, la conversión ha sido mucho más lenta, lo cual ha conducido a los
críticos a sostener que el éxito chileno se debe a la naturaleza única de
Chile, su gente y su cultura política.
<dd>	Están equivocados. La reforma funciona en todas partes y el modelo chileno
es transferible. Y ahora que las altas tasas de ahorro se han convertido en
el objetivo de los reformistas en todo el mundo, vale la pena comparar el
exitoso modelo chileno con las malas copias que han conducido a resultados
mediocres.
<dd>	El objetivo es, o debiera ser, dar las mejores pensiones al mayor número de
trabajadores, al menor costo posible. En Chile así se hizo al promover
cuentas individuales, cuyos beneficios reflejarían el esfuerzo individual en
ahorrar, al mismo tiempo que se promovió la competencia entre los
administradores privados de fondos. Un mercado competitivo impulsado por
ahorradores motivados generó buenos rendimientos.
<dd>	Al mismo tiempo, Chile tomó los pasos necesarios para ir eliminando
paulatinamente el viejo sistema estatal de reparto, que es costoso,
ineficiente y está condenado a la insolvencia. Eso fue clave porque de otra
manera hubiera sido un freno al crecimiento económico. Y más importante aún,
el gobierno adoptó un nuevo lema: los incentivos funcionan.
<dd>	Desde 1981, todos los nuevos empleados en Chile optan por el sistema de
cuentas individuales bajo una administración privada escogida por el
trabajador. Sólo a los antiguos trabajadores se les permitió quedarse en el
sistema estatal, si así querían. El establecer una fecha de cierre para el
sistema estatal generó confianza en el nuevo sistema de capitalización.
<dd>	Durante la transición a un sistema individual de capitalización, el
gobierno tuvo que buscar la forma de pagar obligaciones a los retirados a
medida que se reducían los ingresos del viejo sistema. Los jóvenes ya no
estaban aportando las cuotas necesarias para pagar a los retirados ya que
ese dinero iba a sus cuentas individuales. El gobierno, entonces, emitió
Bonos de Reconocimiento a aquellos que ya habían contribuido, definiendo el
monto de las acreencias oficiales.
<dd>	A los trabajadores que se cambiaron para el sistema privado se les ofreció
una rebaja en la contribución mandatoria y por ley todo el beneficio de este
recorte fue a parar a los trabajadores. Impuestos a la nómina para cubrir
pensiones, invalidez y salud que alcanzaban entre 30% y 35% en el viejo
sistema se redujeron a alrededor de 20%. Los trabajadores que se cambiaron
vieron de inmediato aumentar sus ingresos.
<dd>	Por el contrario, en Perú, Colombia y la Argentina se ignoró la
contradicción que significa continuar paralelamente con el viejo sistema
estatal, dejando escoger a los trabajadores entre los dos. Algunos de los
nuevos que ingresan al mercado de trabajo optan por el sistema estatal
quebrado bajo la vieja creencia que el gobierno conseguirá los fondos.
<dd>	Esos gobiernos continúan drenando recursos del sector privado para
subsidiar un sistema estatal ineficiente. En la provincia de Buenos Aires
esto se hace al recolectar un impuesto a los empleadores de 12,6% para el
sistema estatal. Al mismo tiempo los empleados en el sistema privado aportan
obligatoriamente 11% para su propia pensión y pagan un impuesto de 3% que va
al sistema estatal. El resultado es una deducción por nómina de 26,6% sólo
para pensiones. Acabar con el sistema público sería lógicamente lo mejor.
<dd>	Originalmente el sistema peruano ofrecía dos opciones desiguales. El
sistema estatal requería contribuciones de 9% del salario, 3% aportado
directamente por el trabajador y 6% por su empleador, mientras que a los
trabajadores que optaban por el sistema privado tenían que sacar de su
bolsillo 14%. Exactamente lo opuesto a lo que se había hecho en Chile, donde
los trabajadores recibieron incentivos para cambiarse. No sorprende que
muchos peruanos dudaron cambiarse. Posteriormente Perú igualó las
retenciones y desde entonces no sorprende que el número de los que se
cambian al sistema privado ha crecido dramáticamente.
<dd>	Otro error inicial en Perú es el mismo cometido en Colombia, donde se le
permite a los trabajadores cambiarse de uno a otro sistema. Eso socava la
confianza en el sistema privado y retarda el crecimiento de la industria de
administración de fondos de pensiones.
<dd>	Pero el gobierno colombiano fue aún más lejos al hacer publicidad por
televisión diciendo que el sistema privado no era confiable. En Chile, por
el contrario, el gobierno instrumentó una campaña de mercadeo para educar a
la gente sobre la privatización.
<dd>	Hoy el gobierno argentino opera su propia empresa de administración de
fondos en competencia con el sector privado y garantiza un rendimiento. Como
en el gobierno no es necesario generar utilidades, puede subsidiar su propia
ineficiencia, gozando de injusta ventaja. A pesar de ello, el rendimiento de
la administración gubernamental ha sido pobre y los ahorradores más
experimentados escogen entre los administradores privados.
<dd>	El sistema chileno funcionó porque sus diseñadores crearon un mercado
competitivo. Para lograrlo tuvieron que limitar el papel del estado e
hicieron énfasis en la necesaria relación entre esfuerzo y recompensa. La
gente tiende ahorrar si es motivada a hacerlo. Los chilenos, igual que el
resto de la gente, responde a los incentivos.&copy

<H2>TERRORISMO FISCAL CONTRA PRENSA MEXICANA</H2>
Erick Guerrero R.*<br>
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
El PRI, partido en el poder en México desde hace
67 años, está incrementando la represión sobre la sociedad para no perder el
control en las elecciones federales de 1997 y una de las armas que utiliza
son los fiscales del impuesto sobre la renta.
<P>
El próximo año estarán en juego diputaciones, senadurías y gobernaciones en
diversas provincias. Existe el riesgo de que por primera vez en la historia
México tenga un Congreso de oposición, en manos del PAN, partido
conservador, lo que implicaría cierto control sobre el ejercicio del poder
presidencial, hasta ahora casi absoluto. Muchos analistas políticos dan como
un hecho que la población, descontenta por la crisis, ejercerá el "voto de
castigo" contra el PRI.
<P>
Mientras tanto, el ministerio de Hacienda afirma que la evasión alcanza
niveles históricos y que este año sólo logrará recaudar en el impuesto al
consumo (IVA) $7.000 millones, comparado con $9.200 del año pasado. Se trata
de una reducción de 24%, motivada por el desempleo, las quiebras
empresariales y el deterioro del poder adquisitivo. El gobierno tendrá, por
primera vez en siete años, un déficit en el presupuesto para el próximo año.
<P>
El PRI necesita dinero para cubrir el déficit fiscal y para ganar las
elecciones, a la vez que busca maneras de reprimir las críticas de sus
opositores. Por ello se comienzan a aplicar las viejas tácticas contra los
medios de comunicación, para que estos no alienten el descontento popular y
deterioren la imagen del partido de cara a las elecciones. En el pasado se
les cortaba el suministro de papel a los periódicos críticos; ahora se
utiliza el terrorismo fiscal.
<P>
El lema de los terroristas en Europa es "mata a uno y atemorizarás a diez
millones". El lema del Fisco en México parece ser "encarcela a uno y
atemorizarás a los otros". El ministerio de Hacienda ha desatado una campaña
de persecución en contra de líderes empresariales, triplicando los
procedimientos por evasión.  El más reciente alcanzó a Juan Francisco Ealy
Ortiz, presidente y director de El Universal, el diario más viejo de la
capital, de amplia circulación nacional y que se ha distinguido
recientemente por mantener una línea editorial crítica del gobierno de
Ernesto Zedillo.
<P>
Las autoridades acusan a Ealy Ortiz de evasión dolosa por $5,5 millones, de
presentar datos falsos, pagos no efectuados, declaración de ingresos menor a
la real y cuentas bancarias que no "engranaban" en su contabilidad.
<P>
"Al señor Ealy no se le persigue por lo que dice ni por lo que escribe. Se
le persigue por lo que nos debe. No se le persigue como periodista. Se le
persigue como empresario evasor", afirma Tomás Ruiz, subsecretario de
ingresos de Hacienda. Los enemigos de Ealy Ortiz aseguran que siempre fue
adulador de presidentes y beneficiario de gobiernos anteriores. Sin embargo,
para amplios sectores de la opinión pública, se trata de un acto
autoritario, llevado a cabo con el propósito de sofocar las críticas.
<P>
Los dirigentes empresariales más importantes del país condenaron la orden
de aprehensión girada en contra del director de El Universal y protestaron
que fuese tratado como delincuente. El intento de captura se realizó con
lujo de prepotencia, por medio centenar de agentes judiciales que se
presentaron con armas de alto poder. "Ni siquiera en contra de
narcotraficantes despliegan esa fuerza... los contribuyentes son tratados
por el fisco peor que narcotraficantes...", comentó un analista. Hacienda
dio amplia difusión y publicidad al asunto, como para que sirviera de
escarmiento general.
<P>
Los abogados defensores afirman que el gobierno ignoró olímpicamente un
acuerdo de reestructuración de adeudos fiscales que Ealy Ortiz había firmado
meses atrás con el Fisco, lo que demostraría la arbitrariedad de los
funcionarios.
<P>
El presidente Zedillo, en su segundo informe de gobierno del 1° de
septiembre, dijo que sería aplicada "toda la fuerza del Estado" en contra de
los grupos guerrilleros. Pero lo que nunca se imaginaron los ciudadanos es
que "la fuerza del Estado" también sería aplicada en contra del sector
productivo. Y mucho menos que empresarios y periodistas serían tratados como
criminales y delincuentes. La pregunta en todas las mentes es ¿quién será el
próximo? ©

<title>MEXICO: BUENAS Y MALAS PRIVATIZACIONES -- 11/14/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>MEXICO: BUENAS Y MALAS PRIVATIZACIONES
</h2>
Erick Guerrero R.*<br>
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Los escándalos de corrupción, tráfico de
influencias y favoritismo durante el sexenio del presidente Carlos Salinas
de Gortari han desprestigiado en México lo que, en esencia, es un proceso
necesario tanto para equilibrar el presupuesto del gobierno como para elevar
la eficiencia de la economía. Las empresas estatales suelen ser monopolios y
sin competencia no hay eficiencia en la utilización de recursos escasos, por
lo que es necesaria su privatización.
<P>
Los ideólogos de izquierda, enemigos de todo aquello que huela a libertad
económica y gobierno limitado, han sabido aprovechar la situación para
confundir a la opinión pública y tratar de detener las reformas. Identificar
al mercantilismo como una consecuencia inevitable de la privatización es la
bandera enarbolada por muchos políticos priístas y líderes sindicales que
ven en las privatizaciones, la competencia y el libre mercado una amenaza a
sus intereses y privilegios.
<p>
En México hoy todo es culpa del "neoliberalismo": la marginación, la
pobreza, el desempleo, la destrucción ecológica, la delincuencia. "Esta
forma de conducir el debate... es sumamente inconveniente e indebida... es
caer en una especie de oscurantismo; en la Edad media todos los males que
impedían el avance se los atribuían al Diablo y decían que por el Diablo
estaban mal las cosas... todo lo malo era culpa del Diablo; no se explicaban
en términos de la falta de trabajo, de la falta de iniciativa, de la
prohibición que había para explotar las ideas... quienes etiquetan un
conjunto de políticas por medio de un calificativo como el de "neoliberal",
cometen el mismo error", dijo el presidente Ernesto Zedillo en una entrevista.
<p>
La verdad es que apartando la retórica demagógica, la venta de empresas
estatales es el mecanismo idóneo para transformar ramas enteras de actividad
y mejorar la situación económica de familias y trabajadores. Así lo
comprueba la privatización de la industria siderúrgica mexicana. A partir de
su venta al sector privado en 1991, el desempeño de la industria mejoró
notablemente.
<p>
"La reorganización administrativa de las empresas acereras, la
modernización de sus plantas, la reducción de los problemas laborales, el
aumento de las exportaciones y los montos de inversión realizados en los
últimos años, ejemplifican cómo una industria que en algún momento se
consideró vieja, de bajo rendimiento y condenada a un deterioro permanente,
puede desarrollar un gran potencial a partir del esfuerzo de sus
propietarios y trabajadores, en un ambiente de intensa competencia local y
con el resto del mundo", afirma un estudio del CEESP.
<p>
Como casi todas las áreas industriales que permanecen por largo tiempo en
manos del gobierno, la industria siderúrgica fue dejada prácticamente en
ruinas. A pesar de que las siderúrgicas oficiales recibían grandes
subsidios, créditos "blandos", fuertes descuentos en la compra de materias
primas, protección frente a competidores extranjeros, tanto los índices de
productividad como los márgenes de utilidad eran muy bajos, los conflictos
laborales iban en aumento y la calidad del producto dejaba mucho que desear.
<p>
Los síntomas eran los mismos sufridos por todas las paraestatales:
tecnología obsoleta,  la falta de mantenimiento aumentaba el número de
accidentes y reducía la producción. Había una plantilla laboral excesiva: la
industria siderúrgica paraestatal empleaba a 40 mil obreros para producir
7,5 millones de toneladas de acero, lo que daba una relación de 190
toneladas por año/hombre, contra 270 toneladas en Estados Unidos,  459
toneladas en Japón y 677 toneladas en Corea del Sur. La política de control
de precios aplicada por las autoridades descapitalizó a la industria y el
gobierno tuvo que declarar en quiebra a Fundidora Monterrey, una de las más
importantes.
<p>
Para ser rescatada, se requería invertir $2,500 millones y en agosto de
1990 fue anunciada su privatización. A diferencia de lo que ocurrió en otros
casos, el gobierno no buscó obtener el precio máximo garantizándole conceder
un monopolio a un selecto grupo de inversionistas privilegiados sino que se
preocupó realmente por modernizar la industria. Las empresas siderúrgicas
fueron vendidas en poco más de $1.500 millones, cantidad muy inferior a su
valor contable. Como no hubo componendas ni compromisos de tipo político, el
gobierno abrió fronteras a la competencia extranjera, derribando aranceles y
demás protecciones. A casi seis años, la transformación ha sido total.
<p>
Las siderúrgicas privadas mexicanas invirtieron más de $3.000 millones en
modernizar sus plantas; al mismo tiempo que redujeron su personal a la mitad
-a 20 mil trabajadores-, duplicaron sus índices de productividad, lo cual
les permitió formar importantes alianzas estratégicas con empresas
transnacionales en materia comercial y tecnológica. En medio de la crisis
más grave de los últimos 64 años, las maquiladoras y la industria
siderúrgica fueron las únicas que mostraron crecimiento. En cuestión de
calidad, las empresas han obtenido la certificación ISO-9000, lo que les
abrió mercados en 40 países de los cinco continentes.
<p>
Así pues, tras la retórica antiprivatizadora no hay más que una profunda
confusión e incapacidad en reconocer el verdadero origen del mercantilismo,
la corrupción, el monopolio y el fraude. Esos males no son productos del
libre mercado sino del estatismo y del exceso de poder que concentran
funcionarios y políticos. ©

<h2>
RESULTADOS DE LA AYUDA EXTERNA
</h2>
Steve H. Hanke*
<p>
BALTIMORE <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- El presidente francés, Jacques Chirac, ha debido
considerar inhóspito a Washington, cuando recientemente se dirigió a una
sesión conjunta del Congreso. Pocos senadores y representantes hicieron acto
de presencia, enviando más bien a sus asistentes.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Aparentemente ignorando el desaire, Chirac procedió a aleccionar al
auditorio sobre las equivocaciones de la política exterior de Estados
Unidos. Trató de colocar una pesada culpa sobre nuestros hombros por no
gastar más en ayuda externa: "No abandonemos a su suerte a los países más
pobres de la tierra, especialmente a los países del Africa. No los dejemos
en el círculo vicioso de la exclusión, permitiendo se agoten las fuentes de
asistencia oficial, ayuda que es indispensable para que avancen hacia la
democracia y el desarrollo".
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ese argumento ha sido utilizado por los franceses y otros europeos por
años. Desde la Séptima Sesión especial de las Naciones Unidas en 1975, los
europeos han adoptado el objetivo de la ONU, en cuanto a que las naciones
desarrolladas deben transferir 0,7% de su PIB a los países en desarrollo. En
conjunto, los países industrializados derraman más de $50.000 millones al
año sobre las naciones pobres. Tales transferencias corresponden a más o
menos 9% del PIB de esas naciones subdesarrolladas. Dinamarca, Noruega,
Suecia y Holanda sobrepasan la norma de la ONU y Francia casi si la alcanza.
Estados Unidos es el rezagado, al tranferir algo más del 0,1% de su PIB,
convirtiéndose en blanco seguro de los fanáticos de la ayuda externa.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lo que hace ridícula esta situación es que ninguno de los donantes se ha
molestado en averiguar si su generosidad logra algún bien. Por el contrario,
los benefactores se han opuesto abiertamente a todo análisis económico
objetivo sobre la ayuda externa, mientras apoyan los rebuznos de académicos
que predican gastadas frases sobre el tema.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Un destacado crítico que no ha sido silenciado es lord Peter Bauer del
London School of Economics. Por décadas las investigaciones de P.T. Bauer
han revelado con detalle el daño infligido por la ayuda externa. El año
pasado se le unió otro economista del London School of Economics, Peter
Boone, quien publicó un espléndido análisis cuantitativo sobre la
efectividad de la ayuda externa para la Oficina Nacional de Investigaciones
Económicas. Boone hace picadillo del sermón de Chirac.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Utilizando estadísticas de 97 países receptores de ayuda exterior, Boone
concluye:
<p>· No existe relación alguna entre los niveles de ayuda y las tasas de
crecimiento de los países receptores, implicando que falta de capital no es
una causa fundamental de pobreza.
<p>· La ayuda externa no tiene impacto alguno en reducir las tasas de impuestos
o eliminando otras políticas distorsionantes que retrasan el crecimiento en
las naciones pobres.
<p>· La ayuda externa logra un impacto insignificante en mejorar las mediciones
básicas de desarrollo humano, tales como la mortalidad infantil y el
porcentaje de niños en las escuelas.
<p>· La ayuda externa es muy efectiva aumentando el tamaño del gobierno y
llenándole los bolsillos a las elites de los países receptores. 75% de la
ayuda externa se utiliza para aumentar los gastos gubernamentales, lo cual
aumenta el clientelismo y el poder de funcionarios y políticos. La situación
de la gente pasa a depender de la política gubernamental y de decisiones
oficiales. Esto distrae la energía empresarial de sus actividades privadas
para concentrarlas en la obtención de favores, privilegios y corrupción.<p>
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Quizás porque también son políticos, pocos dirigentes de los países ricos
se han dado cuenta que la ayuda externa hace más daño que bien. A la fecha
sólo un líder ha captado el efecto corrosivo de la ayuda externa y ha tenido
el coraje de denunciarla. Václav Klaus, primer ministro de la República
Checa dijo: "No sólo nos ufanamos de poderlo lograr nosotros mismos, sino
que estamos profundamente convencidos que tal ayuda es negativa y
contraproducente". Esa actitud ayuda a comprender porqué ese es el país
excomunista más exitoso.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Hasta Francia se está viendo obligada a reducir su ayuda externa para
ceñirse a los criterios del Tratado de Maastricht. Eso será bueno para
Francia y mejor para los países que están siendo corrompidos por la ayuda
francesa.&copy; <p>

<H2>Hora de decidir sobre la ONU.

Jesse Helms*<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--  En 
base a sus actuales operaciones, la Organización de
las Naciones Unidas no merece el apoyo americano. Su burocracia prolifera,
sus costos se disparan, su misión está en permanente expansión y muy por
encima de su capacidad. Peor todavía, con la constante ampliación de sus
actividades, la ONU está siendo transformada de una institución compuesta
por estados soberanos en una entidad cuasi-soberana. Esa transformación es
una amenaza a los intereses nacionales y está siendo financiada
principalmente por los contribuyentes de este país, quienes aportan más de
$3.500 millones al año, convirtiéndonos en el más generoso benefactor de
esta organización sedienta de poder.
<P>
 La situación es insostenible. La ONU tiene que ser totalmente reformada.
Sin embargo, el secretario general Boutros Boutros-Ghali ha ignorado las
múltiples advertencias, protegiendo su inflada burocracia e insistiendo en
la creación de un ejército propio de las Naciones Unidas y el poder de
recolectar impuestos directamente. Del empeño reformista de su próximo
secretario general dependerá la supervivencia de la ONU.
 <P>
La ONU fue creada para ayudar a facilitar soluciones pacíficas de disputas
internacionales. Pero la élite internacional que maneja la ONU desprecia la
noción de intereses parroquiales, cuando lo que importa es el interés
mundial. Esa manera de pensar se ajusta al movimiento en favor de una mayor
centralización del poder político en manos de una élite, a costa de los
individuos y sus representantes locales. Sólo ahora se comienza a comprender
el efecto destructivo de las burocracias centralizadas y del control estatal
de las actividades económicas. Vemos que una vez establecidas, las
burocracias junto con las dádivas que reparten son casi imposibles de
desmantelar.
<P>
 A medida que nos acercamos al nuevo  milenio, el virus de la centralización
se extiende a nivel global y la ONU es el portador. Se trata de impedir que
una burocracia que no ha sido electa por nadie siga aumentando su poder a
costa de líderes nacionales electos democráticamente. 
 ¿Cuán grande es el problema? Según los últimos datos oficiales, la ONU
emplea a 53.744 burócratas. Según esta inmensa burocracia, no existe
problema internacional, nacional ni local que no sea problema de la ONU. Ahí
tenemos la reciente conferencia Habitat II en Estambul, donde la ONU gastó
millones de dólares para tratar los problemas de las ciudades, asuntos que
legítimamente deben ser manejados por los gobiernos locales.
<P>
 No sólo se trata de que la ONU no debe estar metiendo las narices en todo,
sino que al hacerlo empeora la situación. En lugar de ayudar a las naciones
a que encaren sus problemas, la ONU hace lo opuesto al crear desincentivos.
Cuando todo problema local y regional se convierte en uno mundial, nadie es
responsable. Al ser la responsabilidad de todos se convierte en la
responsabilidad de nadie.
<P>
La guerra en Bosnia es el ejemplo perfecto. Confrontar el genocidio y la
agresión de Serbia era una responsabilidad europea y de Estados Unidos. Pero
la administración Clinton y sus aliados europeos pasaron la responsabilidad
a la ONU, la cual aceptó una misión imposible de cumplir. Las operaciones de
paz de la ONU fueron la excusa para la inacción, por lo que murieron decenas
de miles de civiles inocentes, mientras la ONU con una combinación de
impotencia y negligencia no hizo nada para detener el genocidio.
<P> 
La ONU tiende a complicar todo dando excusas para que intervengan naciones
sin interés en determinados problemas. ¿Qué tienen que ver Togo, Zaire,
Panamá, Irlanda y China con la paz en el Medio Oriente? Lo que la ONU logra
es darle cabida a muchos países que nada  contribuyen a las discusiones.
Haciendo de cada asunto un problema mundial, la ONU intenta crear un mundo
que no existe. Vale la pena preservar una ONU consciente de sus
limitaciones, pero una ONU que insista en imponer a naciones soberanas su
visión utópica está pidiendo que la desmantelen.
<P>
 La reforma necesaria incluye reemplazar al secretario general por otro que
comience desde el primer día reduciendo la burocracia, limitando las
misiones y redefiniendo objetivos. Se requiere un recorte de no menos del
50% de la burocracia. Mientras esta permanezca seguirá encontrando misiones
para justificar su existencia. Y hay que acabar con conferencias y comités
innecesarios.
<P>
 Por ejemplo, el gran logro del Comité para el Uso Pacífico del Espacio fue
aprobar la resolución por la cual los estados miembros reportarían todos los
contactos con seres extraterrestres directamente al secretario general.
Además de masivas y derrochadoras conferencias, como la de Beijing sobre las
mujeres, la ONU está todo el tiempo patrocinando reuniones y paneles de
discusión, 7.000 de estos en Ginebra el año pasado.
<P> 
También hay que revisar a fondo el presupuesto. El presupuesto que maneja
el secretario general hay que reducirlo de $1.000 millones a $250 millones.
Así cada programa tendría que pasar el examen del mercado, al valorar cada
nación los programas en que participará, diciendo cuánto está dispuesta a
pagar. Continuarían los programas vitales, mientras desaparecen aquellos
favorecidos sólo por la burocracia interna.
<P>
 El negocio de la paz es el que más ha crecido, de $230 millones en 1988 a
$3.600 millones en 1996. Ahora "mantener la paz" tiene múltiples
significados, desde instrumentar elecciones y alimentar a los hambrientos
hasta construir naciones.
<P>
 Llegó la hora para un ultimátum de Estados Unidos: o se reforma rápida y
dramáticamente a la ONU o nos retiramos. Sin esta amenaza, nada sucederá.
Retener parte de las contribuciones no ha funcionado. No podemos llegar al
año 2000 con la estructura actual. Claro que la ONU se opondrá, lo mismo que
muchas de las naciones menos desarrolladas que se benefician del sistema
actual y ganan influencia vendiendo su soberanía a la organización. Por
ello, la responsabilidad del próximo secretario general será inmensa. Se
trata de una tarea gigantesca, pero de no lograrse, no vale la pena salvar a
la ONU y yo, entonces, estaría a la cabeza del ataque para que Estados
Unidos se retire. ©

<h2>
EL BANCO MUNDIAL: 50 AÑOS DE FRACASOS
</h2>

Bryan T. Johnson*
<p>

WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- El presidente Clinton recomienda que Estados Unidos
aporte más dinero a instituciones como el Banco Mundial y su administración
se comprometió a dar $800 millones a la Agencia para el Desarrollo
Internacional, una de las subsidiarias del Banco. Eso es $100 millones más
que en el último presupuesto. Darle más dinero al Banco Mundial es ignorar
la abrumadora evidencia de que sus programas han hecho muy poco en promover
el crecimiento económico de las naciones menos desarrolladas. Es más, ignora
las lecciones económicas sobre las verdaderas causas del desarrollo.
<dd>	Desde su fundación en 1944, el Banco Mundial ha participado en unas 165
naciones, argumentando que los países menos desarrollados tienen pocas
posibilidades de prosperar sin substanciales préstamos subsidiados
provenientes del mundo desarrollado. Además, considera estar en una posición
única para enfrentar ese reto, por lo cual debe continuar transfiriendo
capital a las naciones pobres.
<dd>	El Banco Mundial está simplemente equivocado. Las estadísticas muestran que
los más viejos receptores de dinero del Banco Mundial no están hoy en
mejores condiciones que cuando recibieron el primer préstamo y muchos están
peor. 	Aquellas naciones que han salido del subdesarrollo durante los
últimos 30 años lo lograron liberando las fuerzas productivas en sus
economías. Los mejores ejemplos son Hong Kong y Singapur.
<dd>	Hoy el Banco Mundial tiene 178 miembros; sólo 12 países no son miembros.
Los aportes de los miembros dependen del tamaño de sus economías. Estados
Unidos ha sido el mayor contribuyente, habiendo aportado $53.000 millones
desde 1944. 
<dd>	El propósito original del Banco fue prestar a las naciones desbastadas por
la Segunda Guerra para que reconstruyeran sus infraestructuras. Los bancos
privados no hacían estos préstamos por ser demasiado arriesgados y porque
muchas de esas naciones habían incumplido sus obligaciones después de la
Primera Guerra. Pero mientras el Banco Mundial prestó $543 millones a
naciones de Europa Occidental entre 1945 y 1950, las inversiones privadas de
Estados Unidos alcanzaron $1.760 millones durante el mismo período. 
<dd>	Para 1950 era obvio que el Banco Mundial había servido su propósito y para
mediados de los 60 comenzó a transformarse en una agencia de beneficencia
internacional. El cerebro de esta transformación fue el ex Secretario de
Defensa estadounidense Robert McNamara, bajo quien se formuló el concepto de
"desarrollo sostenible". Resumidamente eso significa que los países menos
desarrollados pueden obtener niveles de desarrollo sostenible sólo si
suficientes recursos son transferidos de los países ricos a los pobres. El
Banco Mundial continúa totalmente identificado con esa manera de pensar.
<dd>	Desde su fundación el Banco ha provisto más de $356.000 millones,
principalmente a naciones pobres. De 66 naciones menos desarrolladas que han
recibido fondos del Banco durante más de 25 años, 37 no están hoy en mejor
situación y 20 están peor. De esas 20, las economías de ocho se han
contraído en 20% o más.
<dd>	Entre 1965 y 1995, Nicaragua recibió $637 millones de ayuda del Banco
Mundial. En esos 30 años el ingreso per capita de los nicaragüenses se
redujo de $1.752 al año a $875. Niger recibió del Banco más de $589 millones
entre 1965 y 1995, mientras que el ingreso per capita de esa nación africana
cayó de $605 a $280. Después de tres décadas es evidente que los receptores
de ayuda a largo plazo no alcanzan un "desarrollo sostenible".
<dd>	La principal razón del estancamiento en esas naciones es falta de libertad
económica y la mayoría de los préstamos del Banco van a países sin libertad
económica. De los 18 países receptores de fondos del Banco cuyas economías
han retrocedido 16 son economías "no libres" o "reprimidas" según el Indice
1996 de Libertad Económica y se caracterizan por altos impuestos, barreras a
las importaciones, restricciones a las inversiones extranjeras, onerosas
regulaciones, controles de precio y de salarios, infames políticas
monetarias e inmensos mercados negros.
<dd>	Es obvio que el enfoque del Banco Mundial ha fracasado y el retiro del
apoyo de Estados Unidos no sólo ahorraría miles de millones a los
contribuyentes sino que le daría la oportunidad a naciones del mundo menos
desarrollado a romper las cadenas que los han mantenido empobrecidos.&copy

INDICE DE LIBERTAD ECONOMICA

Bryan T. Johnson*
<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Hasta Estados Unidos podría aprender de Chile. De hecho,
varios distinguidos economistas estadounidenses están actualmente estudiando
la manera cómo Chile privatizó su sistema nacional de pensiones. Con el
Seguro Social en este país deslizándose hacia la insolvencia, podríamos
aprender de Chile la mejor manera de proteger a las personas retiradas.
<P>
 Aunque Chile no goza actualmente de una economía idealmente libre (a escala
mundial ocupa el rango 22 entre los 150 países evaluados), sí tiene la
economía más libre de América Latina. Si incluimos a las naciones del
Caribe, Bahamas está por delante de Chile, en el puesto número 9, a nivel
mundial.
<P>
 Lamentablemente, el hemisferio también cuenta con tres de las economías más
reprimidas del mundo: Cuba, en el puesto 148, además de Surinam y Haití,
empatados en el puesto 133.
<P>
 Esta evaluación y jerarquía provienen del "Indice de Libertad Económica
1997", editado conjuntamente por Heritage Foundation y The Wall Street
Journal, libro a publicarse el 16 de diciembre. Allí Hong Kong sigue
ocupando el primer puesto, como la economía más libre del mundo. Este
volumen de 520 páginas presenta estadísticas comparativas sobre el nivel de
libertad económica en 150 naciones.
<P>
 El Indice muestra a otros 13 países de América Latina y el Caribe con
economías básicamente libres: Panamá (31), El Salvador empatado con Trinidad
y Tobago en el puesto 34, Jamaica (36), Argentina (42), Belice y Uruguay
empatados en el puesto 43, Paraguay (46), Costa Rica empatado con Guatemala
y Barbados en el puesto 50, Bolivia (59) y Perú (64).
<P>
 Los países sin libertad económica en el hemisferio incluyen al Ecuador
(75), Colombia (78), Honduras (84), Brasil y México empatados en el puesto
94, la República Dominicana (100), Guyana (104) y, a la cola, Nicaragua y
Venezuela en la posición 108.
<P>
 En cada país se analizan diez factores determinantes: si tienen una
política de intercambio comercial abierta o restrictiva, las tasas del
impuesto personal y empresarial, el grado de intervención gubernamental en
la economía, si goza de una moneda estable, el grado en que motiva o
desalienta la inversión extranjera, si los salarios y precios son libremente
determinados por el mercado o fijados por el gobierno, cuán efectivamente se
protegen los derechos de propiedad, el volumen de regulación estatal y el
tamaño de la economía informal. A cada país se le asigna una nota en cada
una de estas 10 áreas, del uno (mejor) al cinco (peor). Luego se saca un
promedio de estas notas y al país se le asigna su posición según el promedio
obtenido.
<P>
 Además de presentar un informe anual sobre el grado de libertad económica,
este libro de Heritage y The Wall Street Journal  explica porqué unos países
prosperan y otros retroceden. Las naciones económicamente más libres son
también las más ricas, con el mayor ingreso per capita.
<P>
¿Por qué es esta una información importante? Tomemos el caso de Bangladesh,
en el puesto 118, un poco peor que Venezuela y Nicaragua. Si Bangladesh
continúa con sus actuales políticas económicas le tomará 102 años alcanzar
el actual nivel de vida de Estados Unidos y de Europa occidental. Por el
contrario, si Bangladesh aplica políticas similares a Chile, obteniendo un
crecimiento de 6% anual, su gente alcanzaría el nivel de vida de Estados
Unidos en 40 años. La clave es la libertad económica.
<P>
 Aunque la liberación económica no puede transformar a una nación de la
noche al día, varios países de nuestro hemisferio están avanzando por ese
camino: Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala, Perú, Barbados y Jamaica han seguido
progresando sucesivamente en las tres ediciones anuales del Indice. Por el
contrario, Venezuela y Colombia han retrocedido durante el mismo tiempo.
<P>
 El clima, la cultura, la educación, la geografía, la infraestructura, la
fertilidad de sus tierras, sus riquezas naturales y la innovación
tecnológica contribuyen al éxito económico de un país, pero ninguna nación,
a largo plazo, tiene éxito sin libertad económica. Esto lo han demostrado
Chile y los "tigres" del Asia (Hong Kong, Singapur, Corea del Sur y Taiwan).
América Latina está cada día más consciente de ello. ©

<h2>
EL CAPITALISMO CHECO
</h2>
Václav Klaus*
<p>
WASHINGON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.-  En 1996, por sexto año consecutivo, en la República
Checa tenemos un presupuesto equilibrado, lo cual es un logro importante. Y
eso no se trata de inventos económicos sofisticados sino de la habilidad de
los líderes políticos en decir que no a gastos excesivos.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Han pasado casi seis años desde que colapsó el comunismo y estamos entrando
a una nueva era que llamamos postransformación. Ya las medidas
gubernamentales importantes para la transformación se tomaron. No prevemos
implementar nuevas medidas extraordinarias. Como suelo decir, la cirugía
terminó y estamos en la sala de recuperación. Los retos que ahora
enfrentamos y las obras por realizar son más normales, lo que significa que
los libros de texto de economía elemental son de mayor utilidad ahora para
nosotros que hace cinco o seis años. 
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Comenzamos todo el proceso de transformación con una clara visión de adonde
queríamos ir, basado en los principios de "laissez faire", una economía de
mercado sin adjetivos calificativos, propiedad privada, gobierno pequeño, un
estado de derecho, libertad y responsabilidad individual.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Una clara visión es absolutamente crucial, pero no es suficiente. Hay que
contar con una estrategia para instrumentar esa visión. Y no me refiero a
planes constructivistas porque sabemos que no es posible promover la mano
invisible del mercado con la mano visible de políticos o intelectuales
omnipotentes. Sabíamos que teníamos que desregular, liberalizar y privatizar
en cada etapa del proceso de transformación, aún ante la realidad de un
mercado débil y por lo tanto ineficiente. Por ello nuestra estrategia fue
flexible y pragmática. Se trataba de un proceso evolutivo, del comunismo a
la sociedad libre, que no podía ser dictado desde arriba.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conceptualmente era simple. Hace algunos años se hablaba de la economía de
la transformación, pero eso es un disparate. Es suficiente aplicar la
economía, la sociología y las ciencias políticas normales.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
La privatización fue crucial y comenzamos de cero. Me daba risa cuando
algún banquero occidental me decía de la importancia de privatizar el
correo. Mi respuesta era que primero teníamos que privatizar las bodegas de
comestibles, al peluquero, al cafetín y al taller mecánico.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Las diferencias con las privatizaciones en Inglaterra son notables. Allá
privatizaban tres o cuatro empresas cada año, mientras que nosotros
privatizábamos tres o cuatro empresas cada hora. Y ahora hemos alcanzado la
posición en donde podemos discutir si vamos a privatizar 100% los
ferrocarriles o sólo parcialmente.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
En cualquiera de las etapas, la única manera de proceder es a través de la
economía de libre mercado, con propiedad privada y precios que reflejen
libremente el valor real de las cosas. Esa es la única manera de preservar
la humanidad y el medio ambiente. Sabemos que el mayor peligro para el medio
ambiente es la liquidación de la propiedad privada y el rechazo de los
precios libres, como fuente de información para saber sobre la escasez
relativa de los diferentes recursos. Los mayores crímenes contra el medio
ambiente han ocurrido en países donde no hay propiedad privada, mercados ni
precios.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nuestra misión ahora es defender la libertad económica, evitando la
reaparición del dirigismo, de intervenciones gubernamentales restrictivas e
improductivas, que ahora se presentan bajo nuevas banderas, pero que son tan
dañinas como en el pasado. El peligro yace en la introducción de nuevas
políticas basadas en los intereses de grupos de presión, en la ideología del
corporativismo y el sindicalismo, en falsas teorías de justicia social, en
el ecologismo agresivo, etc.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Las últimas cifras del crecimiento de la producción industrial checa es de
21%, de la construcción 19%, mientras que el desempleo es de 2,8% y aunque
la tasa de inflación sigue siendo exagerada - 8% -, somos el país
excomunista con la más baja inflación.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Queremos seguir abriendo nuestro país en todos los campos. En diciembre
fuimos aceptados en la OCDE, el llamado club de los países ricos, el primer
país excomunista que se hace miembro. Hace poco eso era apenas un sueño para
mi. Y tenemos la intención de ser también miembros de la OTAN y del proceso
integracionista europeo, a pesar de las objeciones que tenemos sobre la
excesiva regulación y control ejercido desde Bruselas. Sin embargo, queremos
ser miembros porque estamos empeñados en convertirnos en una nación europea
normal.&copy; <p>

<h2>
ARGENTINA: PENSIONADOS POR MELANCOLIA
</h2>
Martin Krause*
<p>
BUENOS AIRES <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- 	Hay descubrimientos  que nos llenan de estupor o
asombro, otros no causan la menor sorpresa. En esta última categoría se
encuentran los recientes anuncios acerca de la situación del sistema
jubilatorio estatal argentino. 	
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Afectado por un enorme deficit que lo lleva a mostrar sus cuentas en rojo en
forma permanente, el gobierno decidió contratar a un reconocido
administrador de uno de los grupos empresariales más importantes del país
para que evaluara la gestión del sistema y presentara recomendaciones. Ahora
este experto ha dado a conocer su informe en el cual incluye, entre otras
cosas, las siguientes joyas burocráticas:
<p>· Cinco personas, en la ciudad de La Plata, fueron jubiladas por estar
afectadas de melancolía. 
<p>· Hay 28.000 jubilaciones de fallecidos que se siguen pagando. 
<p>· Supuestamente hay unos 4.500 ancianos de más de 100 años de edad cobrando
sus beneficios previsionales, cuya existencia no ha sido constatada por nadie. 
<p>· Hay expedientes de jubilados con domicilios en lugares inexistentes; por
ejemplo, en el cruce de dos calles de la ciudad de Buenos que son paralelas.
<p>· La Administración Nacional de la Seguridad Social (Anses)  tiene 15
edificios en Buenos Aires destinados al archivo de expedientes. 
<p>· Todavía hay regímenes jubilatorios especiales que cubren a "enlazadores de
perros" y "conductores de perreras" que se retiran a los 55 años, igual que
los zapateros y las bailarinas del Teatro Colón que son jubilados a los 40
años de edad, mientras que para el resto de los ciudadanos se aplica el
mínimo de 65 años. 
<p>· Los abogados de Anses no se molestan en presentarse en las audiencias
judiciales u olvidan citaciones, con lo cual no es de extrañar que la
institución suele perder todos los juicios.
<p>· Hay 138.056 demandas pendientes en los tribunales por más de $ 2.400
millones de dólares. 
<p>· Se han descubierto jubilaciones otorgadas a personas con apenas 3 o 5 años
de aportes.
<p>· En Tucumán lograron su jubilación 30 personas presentando el mismo
electrocardiograma.<p>
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
La razón de todo esto no es que los funcionarios públicos son más flojos o
más brutos que el resto de la humanidad, sino que no tienen ningún incentivo
para llevar a cabo una eficiente administración de lo recursos. Todos sus
incentivos apuntan hacia no hacer olas, mantener el cargo, ganar puntos con
sus superiores políticos y acumular poder a través de mayores presupuestos. 
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sin embargo, Argentina ha realizado una reforma del sistema previsional en
la cual se ha creado un nuevo régimen paralelo y privado de capitalización
individual, el cual se desenvuelve con notable éxito. Pero a diferencia de
la reforma implementada en Chile, aquí se mantiene el sistema estatal de
reparto como jubilación mínima, en vez de eliminarlo con el transcurso del
tiempo como están haciendo los chilenos.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mantener  paralelamente el viejo sistema politizado significa mantener
todos los incentivos para que las situaciones ahora denunciadas sigan
generándose. Podrá realizarse una limpieza, reformular la estructura,
modificar los procedimientos, pero seguirá siendo manejado por gente cuya
eficiencia no es premiada ni su ineficiencia castigada, como sucede en el
sector privado, a través del simple y claro mecanismo de las ganancias y las
pérdidas. Los millones que se gastarán en la reorganización del sistema
serían mejor invertidos en su eliminación total.

<TITLE>Leon: Un Encuentro de Perfectos Idiotas -- 8/7/96</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>UN ENCUENTRO DE PERFECTOS IDIOTAS</H2>
Roberto Salinas León*<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El encuentro organizado por los zapatistas de
Chiapas contra el "neoliberalismo" es una dramática demostración del
subdesarrollado pensamiento que motivó la reciente publicación del libro
"Manual del Perfecto Idiota Latinoamericano". Todos los males del orbe se le
atribuyen al "neoliberalismo": el narcotráfico, la pobreza, la marginalidad,
la tiranía del dinero, la cartera vencida, la iniquidad fiscal, el
imperialismo cultural… Sólo se les olvidó señalar la impotencia sexual, el
malestar estomacal y la derrota de México por Nigeria.
<dd>	
Una linda causa, oponerse a un fantasma como el "neoliberalismo", descrito
con esa belleza sentimental que caracteriza la retórica del que sabe mucho
de nada, experto en conceptos indefinidos, literatos como Carlos Monsivais
que afirma: "el neoliberalismo, una de las realidades mas oprobiosas del
planeta". 
<dd>	
Fue un encuentro de perfectos idiotas latinoamericanos. Son tres las
características que  los definen y las tres se ponen de manifiesto en las
declaraciones del encuentro. La primera característica es el
"antigringuismo". Se insiste que Estados Unidos es la fuente de los males de
la región, desde el ámbito comercial hasta el político. En México, la
perspectiva del idiota antiliberal impide aprovechar uno de los recursos mas
valiosos del país: nuestra vasta frontera de 3,000 kilómetros con el mercado
más grande del mundo. El sentimentalismo nacionalista de  los sermones
contra el neoliberalismo no borran el hecho que la gran mayoría de las
exportaciones mexicanas disfrutan del inmenso mercado vecino ni que gran
parte del capital extranjero que necesitamos puede obtenerse en los mercados
financieros al norte de la frontera.
<dd>	
Estados Unidos es un mercado privilegiado, aun con disposiciones tan
nocivas como sus leyes de proteccionismo subrepticio. Nos conviene
aprovechar la geografía con apertura comercial e instrumentar una política
sensata de inversión extranjera. No aprovecharlo, acusando a los vecinos del
norte de causar todos nuestros problemas es una verdadera marca de idiotez.
<dd>	
Una segunda característica del idiota antiliberal es su fatalismo; la idea
que los problemas de México son producto de fuerzas exógenas, que el destino
nos ha dictado el subdesarrollo. En  ocasiones se cita la caída de los
precios del petróleo y el peso de la deuda externa; en otras, la
globalización financiera, los capitales especulativos, hasta la propia
existencia de mercados financieros. México es un país joven, cuyos actores
son parte de una generación devaluada por la cultura antiprogreso. En los
últimos 25 años, la economía mexicana ha sufrido mayores desequilibrios
socioeconómicos que en los 150 años anteriores, aun cuando ocupamos una de
las regiones mejor dotadas en el mundo.
<dd>	
Es curioso que el idiota antiliberal nunca se pregunta por qué países como
Singapur y Taiwan, sin riquezas naturales, han logrado alcanzar el nivel de
vida de los ingleses y, por el contrario, por qué México, Venezuela y
Brasil, teniendo de todo sufren de tanta pobreza. La razón es la debilidad y
la politización de nuestras instituciones. 
<dd>	
Un país donde se respetan instituciones como el derecho de propiedad y los
contratos, sin permisos ni favoritismo político, acumula mayor inversión en
capital humano y así genera  riqueza. Se trata de crear incentivos y
confianza. La postura fácil siempre es culpar al otro, sin reconocer los
errores que tanto le han costado a nuestra devaluada generación.
<dd>	
La tercera característica del idiota antiliberal, de aquel que todas las
noches antes de dormir hace gárgaras con lo "social", es la teoría del
pastelito: la idea que la riqueza es un factor preestablecido y lo que se
necesita son buenos planificadores que la distribuyan justamente, como si se
tratara de las porciones de un pastel. A ello se añade tratar de solucionar
la pobreza a través de una política fiscal: más y más gasto, sin importar
sus nefastas consecuencias. La distribución "equitativa" de la riqueza que
propone el idiota latinoamericano implica una injusta transferencia de
recursos del sector productivo al sector burocrático, generando rentismo e
imposibilitando la formación de capital, con lo cual más bien se logra una
masiva distribución de la pobreza.
<dd>	
El encuentro zapatista en Chiapas fue un encuentro de envidia, la
característica más perniciosa del idiota latinoamericano. Según el
periodista e historiador inglés Paul Johnson, la envidia "es la mas
peligrosa de todas las emociones populares… el Estado todopoderoso es fuente
de muchos males; pero sobre todo es el mejor custodio de la envidia". ©

<TITLE>Salinas-Leon: MEXICO: EL DEBATE ECONOMICO-- 9/04/96</TITLE>

<i>September 04, 1996</i><br>
<H2>MEXICO: EL DEBATE ECONOMICO</H2>
Roberto Salinas-León*<br>
<p>



CIUDAD DE MEXICO  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- El llamado del presidente Zedillo a un debate
sobre la política económica ha generado gran polémica sobre si se debe
cambiar el modelo y en cuanto a la participación del Estado. Hay tres
aspectos del debate que son fundamentales: el crecimiento, la política
monetaria y la estructura institucional de la economía. 
No hay inconsistencia entre el llamado a debatir la política económica y las
declaraciones presidenciales de que "no habrá cambio en el modelo". Zedillo
tiene toda la razón; no puede haber un retorno al estatismo y al
proteccionismo, por más que decirlo ofenda sensibilidades de aquellos que
persisten bajo la ilusión que el intervencionismo del Estado es la solución
a los problemas de México.<p>
	El hecho que la liberalización sea el único camino viable no implica que no
haya elementos de estrategia económica abiertos a debate. No es el fondo (el
qué), sino la forma (el cómo) lo que se pretende debatir.<p>
	La primera dimensión del debate, el crecimiento, es un caso dramático por
las grandes diferencias que persisten en cuanto a política económica. Por un
lado se discute si la economía va bien o mal, a la vez de cómo acelerar el
crecimiento vis-a-vis el proceso de abatir la inflación. Por otro lado, se
contemplan los mecanismos radicales necesarios para lograr un alto
crecimiento de la economía. El gobierno mexicano plantea una tasa de
crecimiento anual de 5%; y si bien tal nivel es apenas suficiente para
generar los empleos que la fuerza laboral requiere, es ciertamente
insuficiente para superar el subdesarrollo. Por lo tanto, el debate debe
contemplar estrategias que permitan alcanzar un crecimiento sostenido de 8%
anual, congruente con la estabilidad de precios.<p>
	Sin embargo, entre los protagonistas de la política económica se escuchan
diferentes versiones. El Banco de México mantiene que la prioridad es bajar
la inflación, mientras que otros, por la desesperación de lograr la
reactivación de la planta productiva, afirman que el crecimiento debe ser la
meta principal del gobierno. Muchos interpretan esa disyuntiva como una
lucha entre los obsesionados con la estabilidad de precios (inflación baja,
a pesar de bajo crecimiento), y aquellos obsesionados con el crecimiento
(alto crecimiento, a pesar de alta inflación). <p>
	Pero se trata de una disyuntiva falsa porque los objetivos se pueden
combinar. Tenemos que reducir la inflación y simultáneamente lograr un alto
crecimiento económico. No se trata de abatir la inflación a costa del
crecimiento y empleo ni de aumentar estos en perjuicio de la estabilidad de
precios. Hay que aumentar el nivel de vida y ello requiere alto crecimiento,
sano y sostenido.<p>
	La segunda dimensión del debate, la política monetaria, surge de la
necesidad de preservar el valor de la moneda. De lo contrario no hay ahorro.
Nos hemos comprometido en un sistema de flotación, pero no se ha definido la
ruta cambiaria.<p>
	La tercera dimensión del debate es la estructura de incentivos a adoptarse
en la economía. Nuestro subdesarrollo es en gran medida por la ausencia de
un sistema de derechos de propiedad bien definidos. No contamos con
instituciones imparciales que aseguren el cumplimiento de contratos,
derechos de propiedad confiables o que nos permitan derivar todos los
beneficios del intercambio de bienes, debido a los altos costos de
transacción impuestos por un exagerado intervencionismo del Estado en la
actividad económica.<p> 
      	En los últimos 15 años, la economía mexicana ha crecido al raquítico
promedio anual de 1,9%. Y el nivel de vida ha caído dramáticamente, ya que
se trata de un período donde aumentos bruscos de la inflación fueron la
regla, no la excepción. La explicación fundamental de este escenario de
"estanflacion" (inflación combinada con recesión) son nuestras muy poco
confiables instituciones y las pésimas políticas económicas. Por todo ello,
es importante abrir el debate sobre  los detalles de la política económica
nacional. <p>

<h2>
DEFENSA DE LA LEY HELMS-BURTON
</h2>     
     
     

Alvaro Vargas Llosa*
<p>


MADRID <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Durante una reciente gira por varios países latinoamericanos
para presentar un libro que acabo de perpetrar con Carlos Alberto Montaner y
Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza -"Manual del perfecto idiota latinoamericano"- me han
preguntado hasta la saciedad: ¿quién es el más idiota de todos?  Siempre
contesté que los idiotas son muchos pero que, con toda justicia
entomológica, debe señalarse contemporáneamente a Fidel Castro como la reina
de la especie. Y añadí que son idiotas quienes creen que el problema
principal de Cuba es el embargo estadounidense, que su levantamiento
precipitaría la caída de Castro y que la "ley Helms-Burton" es una
conspiración contra la soberanía de Canadá, México, España, Francia, Japón o
la Cochinchina.
<dd>	Se ha desatado en España una fuerte campaña contra la "ley Helms-Burton" de
una inequívoca índole nacionalista. Detrás de todos los argumentos respira
el orgullo español herido por una legislación norteamericana supuestamente
imperialista. Un análisis puramente legal bastaría para demostrar que lo
único que ha hecho Estados Unidos es ejercer su derecho como país. La ley no
dice que se va a penalizar a quienes inviertan en Cuba sino a quienes
trafiquen con propiedades que fueron de norteamericanos y dejaron de serlo
por un acto, no de derecho, sino de fuerza. Quienes no trafiquen con estas
propiedades pueden seguir comerciando con Cuba, del mismo modo que Cuba
puede seguir montando empresas en el exterior para burlar el embargo, como
lo hizo durante tantos años desde su famoso Departamento MC que acabó en el
juicio estaliniano contra el general Ochoa, De la Guardia y compañía. Como
le dijo recientemente el canciller argentino Di Tella al canciller cubano,
Cuba puede comerciar todo lo que quiera con el mundo, siempre que pague.
<dd>	Pero no es éste argumento legal -basado en que Estados Unidos tiene derecho
a proteger a sus ciudadanos, ejerciendo así la función esencial que tiene el
Estado- el que quiero traer a colación. En España, las razones para apoyar
la ley son más poderosas que en todos los otros países del planeta. Se
invoca en estos días, con las venas del cuello hinchadas, los derechos de
las pocas decenas de empresarios españoles que han decidido -con poco
sentido de sus propios intereses- hacer negocios en la Cuba de hoy. ¿Por qué
tendrían estos intereses que ser más importantes, a la hora de juzgar la ley
Helms-Burton, que los de las decenas de miles de comerciantes españoles
cuyas propiedades y negocios fueron confiscados por Castro.  El comercio
minorista estaba prácticamente en manos de españoles en la Cuba de fines de
los 50 y unos 30 mil españoles expropiados por Castro nunca fueron
compensados por aquel acto de brutalidad.
<dd>	Pero hay más: si escarbamos un poco en la historia cubana de este siglo
llegaremos a la conclusión de que un porcentaje elevadísimo de la población
es española. Entre la población cubana blanca (40% del total), quienes no
tienen ascendencia española inmediata son una minoría. En 1902 un censo
estableció que la mitad del millón trescientos mil habitantes eran españoles
(incluyendo, para desgracia de América, a un tal Angel Castro). En los años
siguientes llegaron a Cuba ochocientos mil nuevos inmigrantes españoles,
entre asturianos, gallegos y canarios, que inclinaron decisivamente la
balanza demográfica hacia el lado español. Y no era una inmigración hija o
nieta de españoles, era española y punto. De esa inmigración son hija y
nieta directas las dos generaciones que hoy constituyen el universo de
víctimas de la dictadura castrista y está en marcha una tercera.
<dd>	Si es válida la premisa de Palmerston de que la política exterior de un
país debe ser defender los interese de sus ciudadanos, ¿quién puede afirmar
que España debe oponerse a la ley Helms-Burton?
<dd>	Pero hay aún más: está entre los intereses de España, también, defender la
democracia en los países latinoamericanos. Esto significa, en términos
prácticos, penalizar a las dictaduras. Todavía está muy lejos del continente
americano la conciencia de que la libertad es indivisible, que no se puede
separar la libertad política de la libertad económica. Aunque hay muchos
ejemplos americanos de libertad a medias, ningún caso ha contribuido más a
la confusión ideológica y moral que el caso cubano. El último episodio de la
larga batalla de Castro en favor de la confusión es la "opción china": el
intento de crear unos espacios de capitalismo dentro de estructuras de poder
comunistas o simplemente despóticos. La piedra de toque de esa operación es
la inversión extranjera. Se vende la idea de que Cuba al menos va hacia la
libertad económica, lo que engendrará la libertad política. Que este
razonamiento es farisaico lo demuestra el hecho de que Yugoslavia, que tuvo
relaciones económicas privilegiadas con las democracias desarrolladas,
siguió siendo una dictadura comunista hasta los acontecimientos
cataclísmicos que todos conocemos, y el hecho de que Ceausescu, a quien fue
concedido el trato preferencial por Estados Unidos, se aferró al poder  en
Rumania por 24 años.
<dd> Aunque es cierto que las sanciones económicas no bastan para tumbar
gobiernos, no hay duda de que las inyecciones económicas vitaminizan a las
dictaduras. Y aunque la Cuba de Castro no ofrece ninguna seguridad jurídica
a los inversionistas extranjeros, ni hay allí las mínimas condiciones
económicas para que los capitales hagan buen negocio, la existencia de estas
inversiones provee un sostén al régimen de Castro y le facilita la siniestra
inculcación del "síndrome de Estocolmo" entre sus víctimas, psicológicamente
dependientes de la única mano que les pone un mendrugo en la boca.
<dd>	Es una buena cosa que José María Aznar no se haya dejado acorralar por la
histeria antiyanqui durante la visita de Al Gore y que haya mantenido muy
claras las prioridades; incluso si se está formalmente obligado a oponerse a
la "ley Helms-Burton", no debe perderse nunca de vista que la batalla
principal en el caso cubano es contra la tiranía y a favor de sus víctimas,
y que Estados Unidos -único país del mundo que intenta hacer algo concreto
contra Castro- no es responsable ni de que Cuba sea una inmensa fábrica de
sufrimiento ni de que 10 millones de cubanos no lleguen a producir la
tercera parte de los $30.000 millones que los exiliados cubanos producen
cada año en el país libre que les abrió las puertas cuando todos los demás
se las cerraban.
<dd>	Desde agosto de 1994, cuando Castro lanzó a 30.000 balseros contra las
costas de la Florida (y Washington desperdició la oportunidad de acabar de
una vez por todas con la dictadura), uno tenía la impresión de que la única
prioridad en la política exterior hacia Cuba era evitar nuevos inmigrantes.
Gracias a un error político monumental -el asesinato de los pilotos de
"Hermanos al Rescate"-, Castro precipitó una saludable alteración de las
prioridades en la política exterior norteamericana hacia Cuba. Mantengamos
esas prioridades donde deben estar. &copy;

<H2>LIBERALISMO</H2>
Franklin López B.*<br>
<p>



NUEVA ORLEANS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- No cabe duda que el Estado intervencionista,
estabilizador, asistencialista, planificador e igualitario resultó ser un
fracaso. La caída del muro de Berlín y el desmantelamiento de la Unión
Soviética fueron manifestaciones fehacientes del desencanto de los pueblos
con el modelo estatista y socialista. Ese desencanto no se circunscribe a
los antiguos países comunistas sino que se extiende a todos los confines de
la tierra.<p>
Pero las reformas político-económicas que se han instrumentado en muchos
países, aunque con diversos matices conceptuales, lamentablemente se han
aglutinado todas bajo la etiqueta de liberalismo o neoliberalismo.  Así se
calificó la política de Collor de Mello en Brasil, la de Carlos Andrés Pérez
en Venezuela, la de Salinas de Gortari en México, la de Fujimori en el Perú
y la de Carlos Menem de Argentina. Si bien es cierto que algunas de esas
políticas tienen un corte liberal, no es menos cierto que la praxis
político-económica de estos regímenes no goza de una cohesión conceptual
liberal auténtica. Por eso, muchos no saben o confunden lo que es y lo que
propone el liberalismo.  <p>
     	Para algunos, la alternativa frente al fracaso del Estado
intervencionista es el caos, el desorden, la anarquía, la ley de la selva,
en otras palabras el "capitalismo salvaje" que supuestamente resultaría de
la aplicación del liberalismo manchesteriano o anarco-capitalista.  Nada más
lejos de la realidad. El liberalismo es una doctrina de Estado, cuyo fin
primordial consiste en crear y defender un marco legal e institucional en el
cual florece la libertad individual. Carlos Alberto Montaner escribe: "El
liberalismo es un modo de entender la naturaleza humana y una propuesta para
conseguir que las personas alcancen el más alto nivel de prosperidad
potencial que posean, dentro del mayor marco de libertad".<p>
     	El liberalismo busca una sociedad en la cual cada individuo tenga la
potestad de elegir los medios que más le convengan para obtener sus propios
fines, sabiendo que tal esfuerzo conduce a mejorar las condiciones del resto
de la sociedad, siempre y cuando se respeten los derechos de terceros. El
economista español Pedro Schwartz afirma: "Nosotros [los liberales] no nos
ocupamos del individuo, que sabe lo que quiere, que lleva su propia vida la
mayor parte de las veces con buen seso; nos preocupamos del Estado, por las
razones de su existencia, por la necesidad de que funcione bien, por el
temor de que se desvíe de su tarea para convertirse en un mecanismo opresor".<p>
     	Frecuentemente, de buena o mala fe, se confunde al liberalismo con el
mercantilismo, donde los que gozan de poder económico se asocian a quienes
ejercen el poder político para disfrutar de privilegios,  protecciones,
créditos blandos, monopolios y demás ventajas en perjuicio del bolsillo y de
la libertad de selección de los consumidores, es decir, del pueblo.
En cualquier caso, el libre mercado es sólo un aspecto del pensamiento
liberal. El liberalismo implica libertad política y económica, propiedad
privada e imperio de la ley, estabilidad fiscal y transparente
administración de la justicia, moneda sana y orden público, defensa nacional
y libertad de comercio, tanto en el ámbito nacional como internacional. Ser
liberal no es sólo amar la libertad para tener la oportunidad de prosperar,
es ser tolerante de los gustos, flaquezas y prioridades de los demás,
defender el individualismo y propugnar la privatización de las empresas
públicas. Es todo eso y mucho más. Ser liberal es creer en los demás, en la
dignidad y diversidad del hombre.<p>
Estas condiciones no son producto del sentido común ni son verdades
absolutas o evidentes. Son resultado de la discusión, del debate, de la
experiencia de otras naciones y del estudio. Ningún liberal argumenta ser
dueño de la verdad. Es posible acercarse a ella a través de la duda,
buscando su confirmación o su negación en el quehacer humano y en la
experiencia de la vida diaria. Tal es la esencia del liberalismo verdadero. ©* <i><center>*Economista ecuatoriano, profesor de la Universidad de Nueva Orleans. </center><i><p>

BUCARAM, UN PRESIDENTE FOLKLORICO 
-- 
11/14/96

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>
November 14
, 1996</i><br>
<h2>
BUCARAM, UN PRESIDENTE FOLKLORICO 
</h2>
Franklin López B.*
<br>
<p>
NUEVA ORLEANS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Se dice que Abdalá Bucaram, el nuevo presidente del
Ecuador "tendrá un éxito absoluto o será un fracaso rotundo". El problema de
la incertidumbre se basa más en el fraccionamiento de las fuerzas políticas
ecuatorianas que en la inhabilidad del presidente en especificar un plan
coherente de trabajo. 
<p>
En primer lugar, el sistema político ecuatoriano está diseñado para la
inercia. Los grupos dominantes tienen capturada a la dirigencia política y
civil de tal manera que es prácticamente imposible iniciar cambios
radicales. El Congreso ocupa su tiempo en discusiones inútiles; cuando
logran reunir quórum inician juicios políticos con el único objetivo de
empantanar la acción del Ejecutivo y si a eso sumamos las acciones
obstaculizadoras de un sector judicial politizado es fácil concluir que el
statu quo tiene todas las de ganar.  
<p>
                En segundo lugar, existe en el país una enorme desconfianza
del "neoliberalismo".  Inclusive la Conferencia Episcopal se ha declarado en
contra del neoliberalismo "salvaje". Los sindicatos, los grupos indígenas,
la Unión Nacional de Educadores, las asociaciones estudiantiles
universitarias, los empleados del gobierno nacional, de las provincias y
municipios tienen un formidable poder de convocatoria; cuando perciben una
amenaza a sus intereses salen a las calles en manifestaciones violentas,
cierran carreteras, crean disturbios o se declaran en huelga, lo que en el
Ecuador significa la toma de las instalaciones y la interrupción de las
labores ordinarias. Los dirigentes sólo necesitan enarbolar la etiqueta
"neoliberalismo" para impedir cualquier cambio que no les convenga. 
Tercero, los partidos políticos, tanto de izquierda como de derecha,
realizan cálculos políticos para el siguiente período. Cuentan con que el
gobierno de turno se desgaste y así poder llegar al poder.  Aún más,
propician el descontento con quejas sobre las partidas presupuestarias o
sobre los nombramientos de gobernadores u otras autoridades y lo hacen desde
el Congreso o mediante paros de ciudades y pueblos. 
<p>
                Frente a esta realidad no es mucho lo pueda hacer un
presidente, inclusive uno con el temperamento de Bucaram.  Además, Bucaram
se topa con elementos endógenos que van hacer su labor aún más difícil.
Entre sus opositores están los que han llegado a sus actuales posiciones por
su afiliación política, aquellos que no tienen otra ideología que la de
disfrutar del cargo público, aquellos que creen que "hacer gobierno"
significa "hacer de las suyas", aquellos que dicen defender los intereses
del pueblo sin comprender el alcance de sus propuestas. Y de todos estos
está llena la administración actual. 
<p>
                Otro elemento endógeno es el folklorismo ecuatoriano, de lo
cual no se escapa ni el mismo presidente: un día se cree Julio Iglesias,
otro día se corta el bigote en subasta, un día regala su salario a los
mendigos, otro día llama "burro" a un ex presidente y luego pide disculpas a
los burros. La característica primordial de lo folklórico es el simbolismo;
es decir, es más importante la forma que el fondo, valen más las intenciones
que los resultados.  En lo folklórico dominan las imágenes y los espejos;
los mitos y los espejismos sustituyen a la realidad. Poco importan los
hechos, lo esencial son las emociones. El Ecuador es un país folklórico por
antonomasia, por eso algunos comentaristas lo han llamado Absurdistán o país
de Ripley. Un ejemplo basta: el año pasado, una organización llamada Manos
Limpias decidió "limpiar" los tribunales, ¿cómo?, pues con escobas y baldes
de agua. Lo importante, repito, es el simbolismo, las intenciones, "sentirse
bien".  Hoy el folklore ha llegado al poder con todo su colorido, pompa y
esplendor. 
<p>
                El tercer elemento endógeno es la tendencia al
autoritarismo. Se militarizan las aduanas, se cierran los locales que venden
licor, se aprehende a muchachos de pelo largo, se amenaza con la cárcel a
los especuladores, se cancela súbitamente un contrato con una empresa de
petróleos; en definitiva, la tónica que va apareciendo es que el "que no
está conmigo está contra mí".  Claro que esto es comprensible frente a los
factores antes mencionados, pero me temo que más que ser producto de la
frustración es el resultado de una tendencia natural del temperamento del
presidente hacia "hacer lo que le da la gana". 
<p>
  Pero no todo está perdido. Aunque en menor grado, hay factores de cambio
hacia un mundo mejor. Entre éstos es importante la actitud de Bucaram hacia
la búsqueda de soluciones prácticas y sus sueños de reelección. Aunque no
tiene una ideología definida, Bucaram es  sincero en su afán de lucha contra
lo que él percibe como "oligarquías", los grupos de poder que se amamantan
de la teta del estado. Intuye el problema sin comprenderlo en su totalidad y
por ello se ha rodeado de individuos que tienen un visión bastante liberal.
En lo económico el más conocido es Domingo Cavallo, pero también hay
asesores chilenos para reformar el seguro social, bolivianos para la
capitalización de las empresas estatales y así algunos cambios se  realizarán. 
En conclusión, la presidencia de Abdalá Bucaram no será ni de grandes
transformaciones ni de grandes desastres. ©

<h2>
NUEVA YORK REPRIME LA INICIATIVA
</h2>     
     
     
Chip Mellor*
<p>

NUEVA YORK <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Esta ciudad se conoce mundialmente por su historia
empresarial y fue en gran parte creada por generaciones de inmigrantes. Las
nuevas corrientes migratorias provenientes del Caribe, América Latina y
Europa oriental vigorizan los viejos barrios con su empuje e iniciativa.
Nueva York está siendo envuelta por una nueva ola de modestos inmigrantes
con iniciativa individual.
<dd>	Veamos algunos ejemplos de la investigación hecha para el Instituto para la
Justicia por Howard Husock de la Escuela de Gobierno John F. Kennedy de
Harvard. En los barrios de Brooklyn y Queens, cientos de autobusetes -casi
todos manejados por inmigrantes del Caribe- trasladan pasajeros regularmente
hasta las estaciones del metro. El precio del pasaje es inferior al de los
autobuses públicos  y, según los usuarios, el servicio es mejor y más confiable.
<dd>	En Harlem y otras barriadas negras surgen de la noche a la mañana salones
de belleza que se especializan en peinados de múltiples y diminutas
trencillas. En las esquinas y lotes vacíos de los barrios surgen
"pulgueros", ferias y mercados de vegetales, donde caribeños y africanos
venden toda clase de productos, desde franelas hasta libros, mientras otros
preparan alimentos de todas partes del mundo. Se estima que los vendedores
callejeros en Nueva York ya suman 25.000.
<dd>	En una ciudad donde el 10% de la población vive de la beneficencia pública
y decenas de miles están presos por tráfico de drogas, esta explosión de la
iniciativa individual es alentadora, pero las autoridades tratan de
aplastarla, hostigando y hasta arrestando a la gente por el "crimen" de
intentar ganarse la vida productivamente.
<dd>	Los conductores de los autobusetes informales no logran conseguir licencias
de la ciudad para operar y aún cuando las obtienen son multados y hasta
confiscados por recoger pasajeros en una parada "oficial" de autobús. A las
peluqueras negras se les niega una licencia a menos que tomen mil horas de
clases de cosmetología que para nada le sirven en su negocio. Al no tener el
permiso municipal, se les obliga a trabajar en la clandestinidad por el
pecado de ejercer una profesión que el gobierno se empeña en regular.
<dd>	Los vendedores callejeros que aplican por un permiso pronto se dan cuenta
que las autoridades aprueban menos de una cuarta parte y se les dificulta
hasta conseguir una planilla de aplicación. Y si los taxista "piratas" en
lugar de responder a llamadas  telefónicas recogen pasajeros en la calle o
de los aeropuertos tienen que adquirir un "medallón" que en el mercado
cambia de manos por $200.000, cantidad totalmente fuera del alcance de estos
nuevos empresarios que comienzan desde abajo.
<dd>	Las leyes, licencias, permisos y certificaciones ocupacionales cubren 73
páginas del Directorio Oficial de la Ciudad de Nueva York. Se requiere de
una licencia para reparar un videocasete, vender entradas para la lucha
libre, o establecer un estacionamiento.
<dd>	Aunque Nueva York es de lo peor, las manicuristas en Charlotte, los
taxistas en Boston y los vendedores callejeros en San Diego sufren de
similar acoso por parte de las autoridades municipales. El Instituto para la
Justicia adelanta la publicación de investigaciones sobre las barreras
legales contra la libre iniciativa en Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, Detroit,
Nueva York, San Antonio y San Diego. Estamos decididos a llevar adelante en
los tribunales y ante la opinión pública una campaña para restaurar la total
protección constitucional a la libertad económica. &copy

<h2>
MEXICO: CORRUPCION  DE LAS LEYES 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
spanbio
.html">
Agustín Navarro
</a>

<P>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (AIPE).- Se sabe que la corrupción no es un fenómeno
exclusivamente mexicano, pero en los últimos tiempos lo que aquí sucede ha
llamado la atención de los medios de comunicación de todo el mundo.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Siguiendo el "principio de la causalidad", es decir, respetando la
inexorable relación entre "causa y efecto", descubrimos que esa corrupción
es perfectamente consistente con la naturaleza de nuestro sistema político,
económico y jurídico. En efecto, el origen -y por tanto la solución- de la
corrupción radica en buena parte en las normas vigentes (leyes, reglamentos,
decretos, etc.), que no sólo produce, sino que estimula e inmuniza a la
expoliación. Se trata del saqueo al amparo de la ley, frase descriptiva de
la corrupción acuñada en 1850 por Federico Bastiat en su magistral obra "La
Ley". Bastiat definió a la ley como "la organización colectiva del derecho
individual a defenderse". El punto de partida, por lo tanto, es que el
individuo requiere para su supervivencia preservar su persona, su libertad y
su propiedad, y que cada uno de estos requisitos básicos son completamente
dependientes de los otros dos. De ahí también se desprende que la sociedad
tiene el derecho de organizarse y crear una fuerza común que proteja
permanentemente esos derechos. Por ello, el derecho colectivo -y su propia
legalidad- está basado en los derechos individuales. Así como un individuo
no puede usar legalmente la fuerza contra la persona, libertad o propiedad
de otro individuo, la fuerza común (la ley) no puede ser usada para destruir
la persona, libertad y propiedad de los individuos o grupos.<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Bastiat mantenía que cuando la ley no se autolimita y no se confina a sus
funciones propias, se pervierte y empieza a actuar en contra de su propósito
original. Al ser manipulada para destruir su objetivo fundamental, aniquila
la justicia que se suponía debía mantener y destruye los derechos que debía
respetar, poniéndose al servicio de gente sin escrúpulos, que prácticamente
sin riesgos explotan a la persona, libertad y propiedad de otros,
convirtiendo la expoliación, o sea a la corrupción, en un derecho del
gobernante y de sus allegados. Es entonces cuando la ley manejada a su
antojo por el poder político logra su tránsito de corrupción. Así fue como
en México y en otros países se creó una estructura legal, buscando
garantizar derechos sociales y económicos que exceden a los fundamentales
derechos individuales, que para ser satisfechos requieren del uso compulsivo
de la ley en transferir y redistribuir la riqueza. Así se diseñó toda esta
ingeniería de pillaje y extorsión socioeconómica de impuestos, regulaciones,
protecciones, subsidios, licencias, permisos, concesiones, transferencias,
etc., plasmada por doquier en nuestra Constitución y leyes secundarias. Por
el contrario, debiéramos entender la ley,  igual que Bastiat, como un
concepto de naturaleza negativa. Esto es, el propósito de la ley es evitar
que reine la  injusticia. La verdadera justicia sólo se alcanza mediante la
erradicación de la injusticia. Cuando la ley impone por la fuerza una
restricción al trabajo de los individuos o transfiere riqueza sin el acuerdo
o compensación de los afectados, está actuando positivamente y la sociedad
entonces queda en manos del político de turno en el poder, abriéndose las
puertas de par en par a la corrupción.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Por ello, antes de crear una nueva legislación ineficiente, dirigida
combatir la corrupción, hay que revisar con honestidad y con precisión
jurídica todo ese cuerpo de leyes que han creado privilegios y de hecho han
concedido licencias para expoliar y saquear a los ciudadanos, bajo un
régimen de impunidad. Las recientes y escandalosas revelaciones de
corrupción son emanaciones de un pantano ya bien conocido por todos. Los
políticos y empresarios que han disfrutado por décadas los rentables frutos
del "me das, te doy", saben perfectamente cómo manejar ese sistema de
infinita complejidad en que se ha constituido la manera de hacer negocios en
México.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Podrán rodar las cabezas de prominentes miembros de la élite
políticoempresarial del país, según la guillotina desafilada de nuestro
sistema de justicia, si así lo determinan nuestros jueces -lo que falta por
verse-, pero si no se atiende el verdadero origen del saqueo al amparo de la
ley, que permite lucrar desde los puestos públicos mediante la manipulación
de leyes y reglamentos, con decretos que crean regímenes de excepción en
favor de un grupo o sector, con protecciones a la banca, industria y al
comercio, en perjuicio del libre ingreso de nuevos competidores al mercado,
la corrupción no cesará y la misma sofisticación de que ya goza el crimen
organizado hará que retoñe. Conclusión: La corrupción, como las escaleras,
se barre de arriba hacia abajo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Citemos finalmente a Montesquieu, quien en "El espíritu de las leyes",
nos dice: "Hay dos géneros de corrupción: una cuando el pueblo no observa
las leyes, y el otro cuando el pueblo es corrompido por las leyes, mal
incurable ya que radica en el único remedio que el mal tendría".

<h2>
LA INEFICAZ ESTRATEGIA CONTRA LAS DROGAS 
</h2>     
     
     
Agustín Navarro*
<p>

CIUDAD DE MEXICO <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- En 1919 fue ratificada la enmienda 18 de la
Constitución de Estados Unidos, conocida como la "Ley de la Prohibición" de
licores. La aplicación de esa ley fue desastrosa en términos de corrupción y
florecimiento del crimen organizado hasta su derogación en 1933. Los
efectos antisociales que tuvo la prohibición del licor se asemejan a los que
enfrentamos hoy con las drogas. Las autoridades internacionales, encabezadas
y presionadas por el gobierno de Estados Unidos, están concentradas en su
prohibición al costo que sea, tanto político, económico o social. El
fundamento conceptual es que ciertas drogas  -arbitrariamente seleccionadas-
son ilegales y sujetas a una persecución implacable.
<dd>	Se argumenta que las drogas son perjudiciales y por tanto se debe evitar su
uso. Fuera de la consideración básica sobre ¿quién tiene derecho a
determinar coercitivamente qué debe o no autoadministrarse un mayor de
edad?, conviene distinguir entre el uso y el abuso. Hasta los alimentos
pueden ser muy perjudiciales si se abusa de ellos. Por tanto, el simple uso
no es una justificación suficiente para considerar algo ilegal y prohibirlo. 
Para demostrar lo anterior y exponer el grave error conceptual comparo tres
alcaloides (drogas): la nicotina, la cafeína y la cocaína (dos legales y una
ilegal), que comprueba la arbitrariedad oficial en su clasificación.
<dd>	La nicotina es un alcaloide líquido muy alcalino que se obtiene de las
hojas del tabaco y es una de las drogas más tóxicas que existen. Actúa con
una rapidez comparable a la del cianuro de potasio. La dosis letal de
nicotina es de alrededor de 60 mg. y dosis tan pequeñas como 4 mg. pueden
producir síntomas alarmantes en individuos no habituados. A pesar de que un
cigarro puede contener hasta 30 mg., la inhalación de nicotina no resulta
tan tóxica como se esperaría y son las secuelas del tabaquismo las más
dañinas. La nicotina produce al principio efectos estimulantes (disminuye el
aletargamiento y la fatiga) y posteriormente deprime el sistema nervioso,
mediante bloqueo neuromuscular sobre el sistema cardiovascular y
respiratorio. Tiene efectos antidiuréticos severos, induce la liberación de
adrenalina, produciendo excitación, temblores y convulsiones, hipertensión
arterial, taquicardia, vasoconstricción y aumento del flujo coronario.
Incrementa la secreción bronquial y salival. Produce diarrea, náusea y
vómito. Su uso frecuente crea hábito y tolerancia. 
<dd>	La cafeína es un alcaloide soluble del grupo de las xantinas que se
encuentra en distintas variedades de los frutos y semillas de las plantas
del café, té, cacao, mate y en refrescos de cola. Es un poderoso estimulante
del sistema nervioso central. Mejora la asociación de ideas y el flujo en el
pensamiento. Es un estimulante vasomotor y un potente diurético, que también
contrae al músculo cardiaco y relaja al músculo liso bronquial e intestinal.
En dosis altas de cafeína predomina la vasodilatación periférica sobre la
vasoconstricción coronaria y pulmonar. Sin embargo, disminuye el flujo
sanguíneo cerebral por el aumento de la resistencia circulatoria. También
acorta el tiempo de coagulación. La dosis tóxica fatal humana es de 10 gr.
Sin embargo, los síntomas de toxicidad (insomnio, excitación, inquietud,
trastornos sensoriales en oído y visión, tensión y temblores musculares,
taquicardia, palpitaciones y aumento en el ritmo respiratorio) ya se
presentan a partir de ingestiones de 1 gr. Su uso frecuente crea hábito y
tolerancia. El té negro tiene un 2% de cafeína, una taza de café tiene entre
100 a 150 mg. de cafeína y en individuos no habituados una sola taza puede
producir efectos tóxicos. 
<dd>	La cocaína es un alcaloide que se obtiene de las hojas de la coca, que
contienen entre un 0,6% a 1,8% de este anestésico local que bloquea la
conducción nerviosa en donde se aplica y que tiene un importante efecto
colateral como estimulante del sistema nervioso central, produciendo
inquietud, excitabilidad y locuacidad. Aumenta la capacidad del trabajo
muscular, disminuyendo la fatiga y acelerando el ritmo respiratorio. A la
estimulación central le sigue una depresión. Su uso frecuente crea hábito.
Produce taquicardia, vasoconstricción, aumento de la temperatura, dilatación
de la pupilas. Se absorbe en todos los sitios de aplicación, incluso  en las
mucosas. Ingerida, la cocaína se hidroliza y es inefectiva. Se destruye
(metaboliza) más rápidamente que la mayoría de los alcaloides. La dosis
fatal es de aproximadamente 1,2 gr. Sin embargo, en individuos no
habituados, dosis desde 20 mg. tienen efectos tóxicos.
<dd>	Aún sin entrar a comparar drogas como el alcohol y la marihuana, no son
válidos los argumentos de toxicidad de unas sustancias o siquiera el de la
letalidad de las dosis para hacer ilegales a unas drogas (cocaína) y a otras
no (nicotina y cafeína). El abuso del alcohol (droga legal) está más
asociado a criminalidad, accidentes, destrucción familiar y daño corporal
que consumir marihuana (droga ilegal). Toda esta ingeniería burocrática
prohibicionista se ha hecho para sustentar ese fundamentalismo
anticientífico que prevalece en la legislación antidrogas y continuar
justificando que las drogas son un problema legal y criminal, en vez de uno
de salud pública, de medicina y educación preventiva, formas mucho más
adecuadas para disminuir su uso y especialmente su abuso.
<dd>	Se han llenado las cárceles de todos nuestros países de presos por "delitos
contra la salud" (en California más del 85%) y Estados Unidos ya ha gastado
más de $150,000 millones en esta guerra santa, pero el narcotráfico y la
corrupción siguen aumentando. Parecería  que los zares antidrogas y los
nuevos Elliot Ness esperan que se contaminen las fuerzas armadas de nuestros
países para intervenir en forma directa como ocurrió en Panamá y que
nuestros sistemas bancarios, financieros y empresariales se vean inundados y
controlados por el dinero lavado ¿No es, acaso, la ayuda tecnológica y
financiera antidrogas la nueva "zanahoria" y el nuevo "garrote" que
condicionan el otorgamiento unilateral de la "Certificación"? 
<dd>	Hay muchas formas de lucrar con las drogas. El crimen organizado -tanto en
su versión gangsteril y violenta, como en la de traje y corbata- bien sabe
que las dificultades impuestas sólo aumentan sus márgenes de
comercialización. Pero hay otros "sepulcros blanqueados" que también lucran
desde la burocracia, con un puritanismo anticientífico y un fundamentalismo
casi religioso, combatiendo a las drogas en forma tal que nunca se resuelva
el problema y si se empeora, mejor para sus intereses personales.  
<dd>	Utilizar con propósitos comparativos la nicotina y la cafeína no insinúa su
criminalización, sino probar lo discrecional y arbitrario de la
clasificación actual de las drogas. Uno de los grandes placeres de la vida
es tomarse un buen café  y  fumarse un buen tabaco. &copy;

<TITLE>Navarro: La Etica y el Mercado -- 8/7/96</TITLE>

<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>LA ETICA Y EL MERCADO</H2>
Agustín Navarro*<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- A menudo escuchamos críticas al mercado libre con
argumentos de que "la mano invisible" es impulsada por las más bajas
pasiones de hombres perversos, sin freno ético ni humanitario en la
consecución de sus aviesos fines de lucro. Tal crítica demuestra una
ignorancia monumental sobre la naturaleza del mercado, pero crea un ambiente
propicio para todo género de alternativas fantasiosas y dañinas en
regularlo, restringirlo o impedir de plano su funcionamiento.
<dd>
El mercado es simplemente un proceso de intercambio de información basado en
los precios como sistema de señalización, los cuales concertan y armonizan
ofertas de productores con las demandas de consumidores de bienes y
servicios. En la medida que las señales de los precios sean libres, sin
controles o artificios, la información será fiel y el mercado eficiente.
<dd>
Por tanto, al ser sólo un proceso, el mercado es éticamente
neutro. No requiere ni de egoísmo o maldad, como tampoco de altruismo y
caridad para funcionar. Lo que requiere la economía para funcionar no son
agentes éticamente calificados sino racionales. 
<dd>
El argumento central de la presunta inmoralidad del mercado
es la famosa "maximización de las ganancias" por parte de los participantes,
argumentando que no existiría en un mundo éticamente perfecto, donde lo
importante es ayudar al prójimo,  concluyendo que el mercado está
fundamentado en una expoliación utilitaria e inmoral. Sin embargo, la
realidad es que la maximización de las utilidades funciona tan bien en una
sociedad de santos como de diablos. La única diferencia es que los santos
aplicarán las utilidades a elevados fines filantrópicos y los avaros las
usarán para fines de diversión materialista y egoísta. La moralidad,
entonces, no radica en la obtención de ganancias sino en su uso. Las
ganancias claramente no son el último objetivo.
<dd>
No hay impedimento alguno para la plena convivencia del
mercado y la ética, bajo el funcionamiento del sistema de precios libres,
basado necesariamente en la maximización de las ganancias. Lo importante es
aclarar que el mercado es éticamente neutro, ya que promueve eficientemente
el logro de metas de todo tipo y, por tanto, es independiente de los
principios éticos o no de los actores que en él participan.
<dd>                
Al reconocer que en el libre mercado (capitalismo) pueden
coexistir individualidades y conductas inmorales con otras que no lo son
surge el requisito para su buen funcionamiento de un marco de derechos de
propiedad que elimine el daño social derivado de conductas repugnantes.
Cuando se respetan las reglas del sistema, los derechos de propiedad de la
mayoría no podrán ser violados como resultado del comportamiento inmoral de
algunos. Por el contrario, el sistema de mercado libre aísla y protege a los
participantes del perjuicio directo derivado de la conducta inmoral de algunos. 
<dd>                
No existe otro sistema socio-económico que ofrezca esta
protección y garantía. Además, el productivo y espontáneo "contrato" social
que ofrece el mercado, basado en la división del trabajo, especialización,
descubrimiento de oportunidades de servir a los consumidores y todo ese
proceso coordinado por el sistema de precios, permite que el nivel de vida
de la población se vea beneficiado involuntariamente, aún por aquellos que
actúan inmoralmente.
<dd> 	
Baste decir que aún los vicios privados pueden generar bienes públicos.
Esto, claro está, no nos exonera de denunciar y repudiar los comportamientos
inmorales, como la corrupción, el engaño y la avaricia. Al final de cuentas
todos somos humanos imperfectos, pero tampoco podemos argumentar que el
mercado y la ética se oponen, o que la inmoralidad es un requisito para que
el mercado funcione. Más bien, es en el mercado donde la ética tiene mayor
campo de acción y la inmoralidad es más inofensiva, en razón directa a la
multitud de opciones que el mercado libre le ofrece a la sociedad. ©

<h2>
SUICIDIO ELECTORAL REPUBLICANO
</h2>
Grover G. Norquist*
<p>
WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Imagínese por un momento ser el candidato a la cabeza en
la carrera por la nominación de su partido a la presidencia de Estados
Unidos. Entonces, un colega suyo, miembro de su propio partido, quien ha
anunciado su retiro del Congreso, introduce un proyecto legislativo que, sin
duda alguna, enemistará profundamente a 2,5 millones de votantes. Además,
esa misma legislación contiene aspectos extremadamente ofensivos para grupos
de fieles partidarios. Y, como si fuera poco, 1996 es el primer año de
elecciones desde tiempos de Eisenhower en que su partido tiene la
oportunidad de alcanzar la Casa Blanca y mantener la mayoría en el Congreso.
Pero, a la vez, necesita todo el apoyo posible para ganar la nominación y
luego las elecciones nacionales. ¿Por qué entonces permitirle a este colega
que ponga todo esto en peligro?
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ese es el dilema que enfrenta Bob Dole con su colega, el senador Alan
Simpson, quien ha introducido un proyecto legislativo sobre inmigración que
es un desastre en potencia para el Partido Republicano. Permitir que se
discuta en el Congreso es una pésima idea por multitud de razones.
Cualquiera que sea el resultado, se ofenderá a un grupo importante de
partidarios.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
El proyecto de Simpson le dice a 2,5 millones de ciudadanos estadounidenses
que se olviden de las peticiones para traer a sus familiares a este país.
Toda esa gente que ha cumplido con las leyes y ha estado esperando hasta 10
años verían que, gracias a los republicanos, el gobierno cambió las reglas.
Gran parte de estos 2,5 millones de votantes, quienes además viven en los
estados con más votos electorales (Nueva York, California, Illinois,
Florida, Massachusetts y Michigan), van a votar únicamente en razón de este
asunto en particular.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Visas para familiares no es un asunto que concierne a la gran mayoría de
los votantes. Se trata de un escenario único: si se aprueba la ley, los
republicanos perderán 2,5 millones de votos. Si no se aprueba, no perderán
ningún voto. ¿Están oyendo esto los candidatos republicanos?
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Este proyecto de ley contiene cosas aborrecidas por diferentes grupos de
republicanos. El Partido Republicano es el partido de quienes quieren bajar
impuestos, sin embargo esta ley le aumenta los impuestos a la clase media,
impone nuevos impuestos al cruzar la frontera y a las empresas que emplean
extranjeros. Tales aumentos se reflejarán en los precios que pagan los
consumidores.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Además, se planea darle a cada ciudadano estadounidense una tarjeta
nacional de identidad, con algún tipo de "identificador biométrico", tales
como huellas digitales o registro de la retina que tendría que ser revisado
por los empleadores. Por primera vez, en la historia de este país, nadie
podría conseguir empleo sin el visto bueno del gobierno federal. Todo
norteamericano que aprecie su libertad debe sentirse ofendido por tal
legislación, especialmente aquellos grupos que sufren de persecución oficial
y que tienden por ello a ser republicanos, como los dueños de armas y
quienes dan clases particulares a sus hijos por no gustarles las escuelas
públicas. Según el Servicio de Inmigración (INS), la instrumentación de una
tarjeta de identidad o registro nacional de trabajadores costaría no menos
de $6.000 millones.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Y, sencillamente, no funcionará.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Quienes quieran contratar a indocumentados lo seguirán haciendo. Sólo
servirá para estorbar a los ciudadanos que legalmente buscan trabajo. El INS
calcula que alrededor de 27% de su documentación está errada. Si
milagrosamente lograran que sólo 2% de sus datos estuvieran equivocados, a
1,3 millones de estadounidenses se les negaría arbitrariamente el empleo y
tendrían que introducir peticiones al gobierno. Cualquiera que haya tenido
tratos con el gobierno federal sabe cuánto tarda cualquier trámite y el
problema que ello representaría para quien tiene que pagar la hipoteca y
alimentar a la familia.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lanzarse a una elección habiendo apoyado el proyecto de ley Simpson
equivaldría a que Bob Dole le pidiera a James McDougal (el socio de Clinton
en Whitewater) que le financiara la campaña presidencial.

<H2>EL DEPORTE COMO MAESTRO</H2>
Michael Novak*<br>
<p>



WASHINGTON  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--  No es fácil ser buena gente. Honestidad, lealtad,
auto-control, disciplina y consistencia son atributos que tienen que
aprenderse para tener una buena y exitosa vida. Son también las cosas que
distinguen a los buenos atletas. Por eso las historias de dedicación al
trabajo, determinación, saber aguantar derrotas y no perder la cabeza con el
éxito son parte del buen camino.<p>
	Los atletas tienen que aprender a aceptar derrotas. Hay que aguantar el
calambre en la pierna y sobreponerse a las preocupaciones. El campeón
triunfa sobre las presiones. De esa manera los deportes nos enseñan a vivir.
Nos entrenan a cumplir con nuestras obligaciones y a obedecer órdenes. Pero
hay más en la vida moral que eso y el deporte nos da la visión grande. El
deporte nos entrena a dominarnos. Aprendemos a fomentar nuestras habilidades
y a controlar nuestros hábitos, a darle la cara a retos difíciles y a
convertirnos en mejores personas.<p>
	Lo esencial para convertirnos en personas morales es hacer el bien en forma
natural. Hacer las cosas bien, como parte de nuestra propia naturaleza. Eso
implica esfuerzo y dedicación. A menudo se comienza cambiando nuestra
actitud y buscando motivación. Uno debe querer cambiar y estar dispuesto a
trabajar por conseguir pequeñas mejoras constantemente, a través de mucho
tiempo.<p>
	En cierta forma, los deportes enseñan mejor la moral que las leyes. Con
demarcaciones, las leyes definen lo que no se puede hacer y, en ciertas
ocasiones, también definen lo que sí se puede hacer, al prescribir las
reglas. En el deporte también se tienen que aprender las reglas. Pero un
buen deportista tiene que ir mucho más lejos, tiene que añadir fortaleza,
exactitud y gracia.<p>
	Y hay otros aspectos morales en el deporte. El deporte es esencialmente
competitivo y el deportista con suerte es el que se enfrenta a otros grandes
atletas que lo empujarán a alcanzar lo más alto, de otra forma nunca
averiguaría cuán grande hubiera podido ser. Cuando no hay necesidad de
heroísmo, no surgen héroes.<p>
	Algo parecido sucede en la vida moral. Hasta que no confrontamos un grave
problema no se prueban nuestras virtudes. Entonces es que nos enteramos de
lo que la fuerza moral significa y si la tenemos o no.<p>
	Las olimpíadas nos recuerdan la tradición moral del deporte. Los griegos no
las concibieron simplemente como un gran espectáculo de entretenimiento.
Estaban más bien calibrando virtudes, hábitos productivos, logros; eran más
una exhibición de la belleza del espíritu humano que alguna distorsión
muscular del cuerpo. Aún hoy en día las olimpíadas siguen siendo una
celebración del espíritu y de los valores clásicos.<p>
	Me pregunto qué haríamos por la educación moral de nuestros niños si no
existieran los deportes. ¿En qué otra actividad los jóvenes de hoy aprenden
a resistir el dolor y la derrota? ¿Dónde más se esfuerzan por alcanzar
perfección? Algunas veces se fajan a trabajar en sus estudios, pero a menudo
hacen el mínimo posible. Y en cuanto a las obligaciones y trabajos en la
casa, en la vida moderna no tienen la urgencia de antes y es realmente poco
lo que ayudan. Pero en los deportes añoran hacerlo bien. Es bello verlo.
Nunca vi a mis hijos con caras más serias que cuando estaban compitiendo en
algún deporte.<p>
	Vale la pena tomar el deporte en serio. Cualquier labor que busca alcanzar
la excelencia ofrece un estupendo objetivo. No es fácil mantener presentes
las lecciones aprendidas en el deporte durante el resto de nuestras vidas,
pero cuánto más pobres seríamos si no tuviéramos al deporte como maestro. ©<p>

<h2>
UNA AGENDA PARA DESTRUIR A VENEZUELA
</h2>     
     
     
Jorge Olavarría*
<p>

CARACAS <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- En los dos primeros años de la segunda presidencia de
Rafael Caldera se formularon siete planes económicos de nombres llamativos,
presentados todos con una fanfarria publicitaria que prometía corregir el
déficit fiscal, estabilizar la moneda, reducir tanto la deuda interna como
la externa y abatir la inflación.  En cada caso, se nos dijo que tras un
sacrificio inicial, la prosperidad y la bonanza estaban a la vuelta de la
esquina.
<dd>	En dos años, el presidente Caldera ha acumulado el mayor déficit fiscal de
la historia venezolana, aumentado la deuda y producido las mayores y más
brutales devaluaciones. Ahora sus ministros anuncian que tendremos que
sufrir una inflación superior al 100%; le "cambiarán el perfil" a la deuda
externa, pero la seguirán aumentando para pagar con más deuda los "programas
sociales". En la historia mundial de la planificación no hay absurdo
semejante y en Venezuela no hay precedente para un fracaso de esta magnitud.
Como barco a la deriva en mar tormentoso, el gobierno de Caldera pasa de un
plan a otro. Sus objetivos se anuncian en cada caso con trompetas solemnes,
pero al poco tiempo los planes y objetivos se hunden en el olvido y nadie se
molesta en recordar las promesas ni contrastarlas con los resultados. No
hubo nunca una razón, una excusa o una explicación. Simplemente, cada  Plan
se enterró en silencio y al poco tiempo se produjo... otro plan. El último
es la "Agenda Venezuela". 
<dd>No podemos olvidar que seguimos gobernados por un presidente que en 1994 se
vio enfrentado a problemas económicos que no entendía y que hoy sigue sin
entender. Por fuerza de sus errores y omisiones, el gobierno ha sido llevado
a hacer en 1996 lo que en 1993 Rafael Caldera dijo que jamás haría. Y la
actual campaña publicitaria para vender la "Agenda Venezuela" es un insulto
a la inteligencia de los venezolanos, utilizando actores de la televisión
para mentirle al país acerca de su presente y su futuro. 
<dd>Especialmente irritante es la publicidad que empieza afirmando que un país
con $18 mil millones en ingresos anuales no es pobre y termina diciendo que
no es cobarde el país que libertó a medio continente. Es insólito que un
gobierno que ha tenido que acudir de rodillas ante el prestamista
internacional de última instancia, porque no puede pagar lo que debe, alegue
por boca de un actor en un mensaje pagado que no es pobre porque recibe una
enorme renta petrolera. La verdad de la magnitud de su ingreso petrolero es
precisamente lo que incrimina al presidente Caldera como incompetente para
administrarla. Hacer una propaganda falsa para generar un optimismo
mentiroso contradice los sacrificios que sus ministros anuncian. Apelar a
una emoción patriótica es comparar nuestro lamentable presente con nuestro
pasado heroico. 
<dd>Sólo un gobierno encerrado en el laberinto de su soledad es capaz de hacer
una campaña publicitaria que implícitamente presenta el último plan de
política económica como genial correctivo de los errores del mismo gobierno. 
Si en vez de los cómicos locutores y actores contratados se hicieran
anuncios con los ex ministros y demás responsables del caos, quizá los
venezolanos empezarían a creer en la Agenda Venezuela. Pues sólo la
sumatoria de tales talentos sería capaz de explicar cómo es bueno y porqué
está en buen camino un plan económico que le exprime a una economía
deprimida los recursos que necesita para volcarlos en mantener un aparato
burocrático parasitario, estéril, inepto y corrupto. Sólo ellos son capaces
de explicar la maravilla de devaluar la moneda para producir una "utilidad
cambiaria", con la cual nivelar este año el déficit fiscal y, al mismo
tiempo, garantizar que el año entrante se logrará acabar con la inflación. 
Ahora bien, cuando la "Agenda Venezuela" desemboque en inevitable
catástrofe, que no  vengan a decirnos que su fracaso se debió a las voces
agoreras, a los profetas del desastre que sembraron rumores y minaron la
confianza.
<dd>El "caso Venezuela" es la madre de todas las paradojas. La más importante es
que la economía venezolana ha logrado acopiar todos los vicios y pecados del
capitalismo sin obtener ninguna de sus ventajas, al igual que todos los
vicios y pecados del estatismo socializante sin  ninguno de sus logros. Como
lo han constatado los economistas extranjeros, las reformas tropiezan con
problemas similares a los que enfrentan los países del ex bloque soviético.
Aquella parte de su economía que podría llamarse "privada" o "capitalista"
tiene la moral flaca y los músculos fofos por proteccionismos, subsidios y
toda clase de malos hábitos que no la recomiendan para competir exitosamente
fuera de su invernadero, dentro del cual actúan con un mercado insincero e
imperfecto que anula las ventajas del capitalismo, mientras exagera sus
defectos. La economía privada venezolana es un muestrario vivo de los peores
vicios del mercantilismo inmoral y del socialismo inepto.
Winston Churchill decía que el vicio inherente del capitalismo es el reparto
desigual de la riqueza que genera y el vicio inherente del socialismo es el
reparto igualitario de la miseria que produce. Los venezolanos hemos logrado
llevar el defecto corregible del capitalismo a extremos obscenos y el vicio
del socialismo a magnitudes monstruosas. &copy;

<h2>
EL 'COMERCIALISMO' OLIMPICO DE ATLANTA
</h2>     
<P>
Filip Palda*
<p>
VANCOUVER, CANADA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).
-- Algunos de los burócratas que controlan losjuegos internacionales acusaron de "vulgar" y de "comercializada" las
recientes olimpíadas de Atlanta, prometiendo impedir su repetición.
Samaranch y su grupo prefieren el fuete gubernamental antes que la mano
invisible del mercado. Pero veamos lo que en realidad sucedió en Atlanta.<P>
 Los juegos fueron organizados por gente que se puso de acuerdo entre sí. La
belleza de los acuerdos y de los contratos es que obliga a la gente a pensar
y a hacer el mejor uso de la información. Si los organizadores quieren
construir un parque no emiten, simplemente, un cheque con cargo a los
contribuyentes de impuestos, sino que tienen que convencer a patrocinantes
como la IBM para que aporten el dinero. Entonces, esa empresa se pregunta si
el despliegue de su logotipo en ese parque justifica la inversión que los
organizadores exigen. Los ejecutivos tratarán de calcular si ello
representará un beneficio para los accionistas de la empresa, de manera
similar a como beneficiará a los espectadores y usuarios del parque. Sólo
cuando las dos partes resultan beneficiadas funciona el mercado. Por eso las
olimpíadas organizadas conforme al libre mercado, como la de Atlanta, son
democráticas y eficientes.
<P> Cuando el gobierno financia los juegos, los acuerdos sensatos son
reemplazados por imposiciones y tácticas de fuerza. Los contribuyentes
tienen que aportar el dinero, les guste o no. Ese tipo de financiamiento
produce una olimpíada tipo Montreal, donde se cometieron equivocaciones por
mil millones de dólares a costa del público cautivo.
<P> El financiamiento a través de impuestos impide que los organizadores hagan
uso de sus cerebros en inventar y desarrollar mejores maneras de servir a
los atletas. ¿A qué burócrata con una bolsa de dinero proveniente de los
impuestos se le hubiera ocurrido el concepto del Aro Reebok? El Aro Reebok
era el sitio en Atlanta donde los atletas rusos participantes en las
olimpíadas podían escoger equipos deportivos Reebok, por cortesía de la
empresa. En una olimpíada de libre mercado, las naciones que hasta hace poco
estaban dispuestas a destruirse mutuamente buscaban maneras de ayudar a sus
atletas.
<P> La prensa ignoró todo lo bueno que surgió al organizar los juegos con la
ayuda del comercio. Los periodistas más bien se quejaban de la lentitud de
los autobuses en el tráfico, de desperfectos en las computadoras y de los
agresivos vendedores de camisetas. Los reporteros no supieron detectar la
noticia más importante: cómo los atletas, los empresarios y los espectadores
obtuvieron algo sin obligar al distante contribuyente de impuestos para que
pagara la cuenta por su entretenimiento y disfrute. ©

CIUDAD DE MEXICO  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--  En un reciente viaje a Europa crucé por carretera
las fronteras de varios países y lo único que vi fueron instalaciones
abandonadas, donde antes detenían a los vehículos para pedir pasaportes y
revisar las maletas de los pasajeros. Ahora, esas garitas están polvorientas
y desoladas. Los autos y la gente circulan libremente.
El extranjero que llega a Europa solamente tiene que presentar su pasaporte
y visa cuando entra a alguna nación de la Comunidad Europea, pero una vez
dentro, se mueve libremente por todos los países integrantes de la unión.
En una de las obsoletas instalaciones fronterizas me detuve, tomé fotos y
pensé sobre todos los años que innecesariamente y sin ningún beneficio al
bien común los gobiernos de los diversos países que ahora integran la
Comunidad Europea obstaculizaron el libre paso de personas y mercancías en
nombre de la soberanía, el nacionalismo, la seguridad interna, la protección
al empleo, a las empresas nacionales, etc.<p>
	El camino para abolir las innecesarias y antieconómicas fronteras fue
largo, azaroso y controvertido, pero es un triunfo de la razón, el sentido
común y los principios económicos sobre el egoísmo, los intereses de ciertos
grupos y los mal entendidos conceptos de nacionalismo y de soberanía.<p>
	La ausencia de fronteras entre España y Francia no ha desdibujado la
nacionalidad francesa ni dañado la soberanía española. Los españoles siguen
siendo españoles, los franceses, franceses y los portugueses, portugueses.<p>
	Desgraciadamente, en México y el resto de Centro y Sudamérica todavía se
escuchan voces arcaicas que identifican los valores patrios y nacionales con
una burocracia que, con aires de perdonavidas, deciden quién entra o no
entra en un país y qué mercancías pasan.<p>
Las aduanas y las fronteras no nacen como consecuencia de una necesidad
social ni mucho menos para mejorar la convivencia entre los pueblos, sino
como un medio de recaudar dinero para hacer frente a los gastos de los
gobernantes, proteger a empresarios amigos en perjuicio de los niveles de
vida de los habitantes.<p>
	Actualmente se mencionan los más diversos argumentos para mantener las
fronteras entre los países de Latinoamérica o con Estados Unidos:
diferencias de ingresos, migraciones masivas, asimetrías de los mercados,
etc. Todas esas razones y argumentos también obstaculizaron durante muchos
años la integración Europea, pero al final se impuso la sensatez y el
sentido común ante el miedo, los intereses mezquinos y los burócratas que
buscan reglamentaciones, obstáculos y aduanas como una fuente de poder y
enriquecimiento.<p>
Después de dos guerras y de millones de muertos, los europeos se dieron
cuenta que la única forma de evitar una nueva confrontación es la
integración económica.<p>
¿Aparecerán líderes y estadistas en Iberoamérica que recojan la experiencia
europea y luchen porque en un futuro, lo más cercano posible, las fronteras
entre nuestros países se conviertan en similares vestigios de la
irracionalidad económica?  Fronteras que durante tres cuartos de siglo nos
han mantenido divididos y que han sido un factor determinante de nuestro
atraso y pobreza. © <p>

<H2>¿GASTO SOCIAL O DERROCHE FISCAL?</H2>
Luis Pazos*<br>
<p>
CUIDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
Una crítica frecuente de los partidos de izquierda
al gobierno es el insuficiente nivel de gasto social. Constantemente se
exige el aumentó del gasto público en obras sociales. 
<P>
El presidente Ernesto Zedillo, en referencia a la importancia del gasto
social en su administración, señaló en su segundo informe anual que "de cada
cien pesos que el gobierno programa gastar, más de la mitad, 54 pesos, se
destinan a mejorar las condiciones de vida de las personas, las familias y
las comunidades". Ese porcentaje, más de la mitad del gasto total del
estado, es similar a lo que teóricamente ha sido destinado por casi todos
los gobiernos mexicanos en los últimos 25 años a lo que llaman gasto social.
Las condiciones de vida de las personas, las familias y las comunidades,
teóricamente destinatarias de ese gasto social, lejos de mejorar en el
último cuarto de siglo han empeorado su situación. Aritméticamente podemos
concluir que los 54 pesos de cada cien de gasto social han sido casi en su
totalidad derrochados y desperdiciados.
<P>
Sobre el número de familias beneficiadas por los subsidios, el presidente
señaló en su último informe: "A través del sistema de abasto popular se
atiende a cerca de 30 millones de personas, principalmente del medio rural.
Se apoya a 2,8 millones de familias de bajos ingresos para el consumo de
tortilla y a 5,2 millones de niños para el de leche". El abasto popular que,
según dijo el presidente atiende a 30 millones de personas, se instrumenta
principalmente a través de la Confederación Nacional de Subsistencias
Populares (CONASUPO). Es un hecho conocido por el público que ese organismo,
representativo del gasto social, ha sido una de las principales fuentes de
enriquecimiento de la alta burocracia. Gran parte de lo subsidios al maíz y
a la leche han ido a parar realmente a cuentas en el extranjero de
familiares de funcionarios, no sólo bajo Salinas de Gortari, sino desde que
fue creada esa empresa estatal. 
<P>
Una cosa es ayudar a los más pobres y otra sostener que esa ayuda se dé a
través de la burocracia gubernamental que, como lo demuestra la experiencia
en todo el mundo, en poco beneficia a los marginados. La solución no es
cambiar los directivos de los organismos estatales de asistencia social cada
seis años ni encarcelar a aquellos que circunstancialmente se les descubren
manejos fraudulentos, sino buscar nuevas formas para que los recursos ahora
destinados al gasto social no se queden en el camino, principalmente en
manos de quienes los administran.
<P>
Si el gobierno dejara de gastar los 54 pesos por cada 100 pesos que destina
al llamado gasto social, que a la fecha en muy poco ha beneficiado a los
mexicanos pobres y recorta, a la vez, en 54% sus gastos, podría reducir, sin
crear un déficit, tanto el tope del impuesto sobre la renta a la mitad (a
17%),  como el IVA también a la mitad (a 7,5% ) y rebajar al mismo tiempo el
impuesto de la gasolina también en 50%. Esos cambios provocarían tal
actividad y bienestar económico, que los teóricos destinatarios del gasto
social encontrarían de inmediato oportunidades de elevar su nivel de vida. 
¿Por qué es difícil instrumentar tan favorables cambios?  Porque cientos de
miles de burócratas han sido por mucho tiempo los verdaderos beneficiarios
de gran parte del llamado gasto social y se oponen a perder sus prebendas.
La mayor parte del gasto social se queda en sueldos, prestaciones,
desviaciones, negocios y gastos de operación de la burocracia encargada de
manejarlo. Y aun lo poco que llega a los pobres es distribuido con criterio
de clientelismo político más que de acuerdo a verdaderas necesidades
económicas. 
<P>
Existe una clara contradicción entre quienes por un lado señalan la
inoperancia y corrupción del gasto social, pero al mismo tiempo exigen que
el gobierno incremente ese mismo gasto social. ©

<h2>
EDUCACION ESTATAL Y POBREZA
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

José Piñera*
</a>

<P>
SANTIAGO DE CHILE (AIPE).- Desde el tiempo de los conquistadores españoles,
la búsqueda de riqueza en Chile se dirigió hacia el suelo. Para algunos esto
significó la exploración en busca de minerales valiosos escondidos bajo
tierra: oro y plata, después salitre y finalmente cobre. Para otros fue el
cultivo de la tierra fértil que produce trigo, frutas y madera. Siglos más
tarde, las principales exportaciones de Chile todavía provienen del suelo.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Pero si la importancia económica de la tierra es un asunto en que existe
pleno acuerdo, la interrogante acerca de "cómo" debe generarse la riqueza en
Chile ha sido el campo de batalla de  doctrinas económicas opuestas. Ese
debate, que adoptó especial fuerza en los años 60, degeneró en un violento y
agudo conflicto que produjo una enorme crisis económica y la quiebra del
sistema democrático.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La doctrina socialista, ya sea en su variante comunitaria o marxista, no
comprendió que el verdadero capital productivo es aquel que deriva su valor
a través de la creatividad y diligencia de su propietario operando en
mercados libres. Por el contrario, erigieron al Estado como gran
redistribuidor de riqueza.	La esencia de esa visión estatista se encarnó en
la gran Reforma Agraria de 1966. El gobierno democratacristiano de la época
intentó demostrar que la riqueza se podía redistribuir tan fácilmente como
la tierra.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El concepto de propiedad reflejado en la Reforma Agraria se extendería
luego a la expropiación de la minería del cobre y a un ataque generalizado
al derecho de propiedad. Los estatistas creen que la propiedad no necesita
realmente un dueño y son firmes partidarios de la propiedad pública, pues
ella efectivamente significa que nadie es dueño.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Pero no sólo debe tener la propiedad un claro dueño; el dueño debe tener
la suficiente seguridad para que se interese por mantener e invertir en su
propiedad. Si el Estado puede disponer de la propiedad privada, quitándole a
unos y entregándole a otros, ni los ganadores ni los perdedores de ese
ejercicio del poder político se sentirán protegidos y seguros de su
propiedad, como para asumir riesgos e invertir capitales para incrementar su
valor.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En 1981, la Reforma Minera chilena enfrentó a la visión socialista que
había generado la Reforma Agraria y generó la ocasión para un claro y
dramático contraste. Al crear verdaderos derechos de propiedad en el sector
económico de mayor tamaño y de mayor sensibilidad política, el mensaje a los
inversionistas nacionales y extranjeros fue que la propiedad privada en
Chile era, desde ese momento, un derecho absolutamente seguro.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Así fue como, en 15 años, se llevaron a cabo en Chile dos reformas de gran
importancia y conceptualmente antagónicas, cada una ofreciendo su definición
del tipo de economía que sería preferible para el país. Un gobierno
demuestra coherencia en su política económica según cómo contesta una
pregunta básica: ¿Cuál es la llave del tesoro? La Reforma Agraria y la
Reforma Minera fueron dos respuestas distintas y contrapuestas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La Reforma Agraria produjo una crisis de la producción agrícola y la
quiebra de la fábrica social del país, mientras que la Reforma Minera ha
significado inversiones extranjeras por $7,153 millones, destinados a
desarrollar riqueza, crear trabajos productivos, transferir tecnología y
recursos sustanciales para invertir en capital humano.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El concepto de propiedad reflejado en la Reforma Minera de 1981 consolidó
una visión nueva acerca de cómo crear riqueza.  Aunque en Chile tal visión
ganó el debate de los 80, esta visión fundamental no ha sido todavía
aceptada ni adoptada en temas que serán de la mayor importancia en el siglo
XXI. En efecto, la contestación a ¿cuál debe ser el motor del progreso
nacional?, permanece indefinida en la ambigua respuesta de la economía mixta.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La economía mixta que postulan los estatistas es la que exprime con toda
clase de impuestos al sector privado moderno y eficiente para apoyar al
sector público anacrónico, ineficaz, politizado y crecientemente corrupto.
La doctrina de la economía mixta es la que condena a los niños pobres a
educarse en escuelas públicas mediocres, en vez de darles acceso a las
escuelas privadas que escoge, casi sin excepción, cualquier familia con
recursos suficientes, independientemente de su inclinación política.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Pero está ocurriendo un cambio trascendental. Si históricamente la riqueza
fue creada poniendo los recursos naturales al servicio del hombre, en el
futuro la llave de la creación de riqueza -la llave del tesoro- será el
cultivo de la inteligencia y el conocimiento humano.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Hoy la extracción de minerales o productos agrícolas del suelo se apoya
más en el uso de inteligencia que en fuerza humana. Pero aunque Chile ha
modernizado importantes sectores de su economía y de su sociedad, el sistema
estatal de educación se encuentra en una profunda crisis porque está basado
en la misma estructura conceptual que originó la Reforma Agraria y que
mantiene a  la mayor empresa  de cobre, Codelco, en poder del Estado.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es un trágico error postular que la preocupación especial por los pobres
exige que el Estado produzca cobre y educación. Todo lo contrario. No
podemos permitir que la mala calidad de la educación estatal los condene a
una pobreza perpetua, cuando existe una alternativa.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El meollo del asunto es que la definición de lo que es riqueza cambió y la
política moderna debe reconocerlo así. Hoy en día la riqueza fundamental es
el capital humano y el insumo básico es el conocimiento. Es probable que sea
menos perjudicial para un país tener empresas estatales produciendo acero o
explotando minas que escuelas administradas por la burocracia estatal. Una
profunda reforma educacional es la tarea más urgente e importante de nuestra
sociedad.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es absurdo seguir considerando a las escuelas como parte del gasto social
asignado para mitigar los efectos de la pobreza. Por el contrario, las
escuelas deben estar en manos de los más capaces en llevar adelante los
mejores proyectos educacionales -programas, metodologías, infraestructura-
que compiten entre sí, para ofrecer a los jóvenes las mejores alternativas.
Esto sólo pueden hacerlo empresarios privados dispuestos a desarrollar su
iniciativa y arriesgar sus capitales a cambio de una legítima ganancia. Los
profesores deben dejar de ser funcionarios públicos regidos por un estatuto
que uniforma la mediocridad, pasando a ser actores activos de los proyectos
educacionales y recibiendo mejor ingreso, ya sea por la prestación de sus
servicios o como dueños de las escuelas. El rol del Estado debe centrarse en
subsidiar la educación de los más pobres y asegurar la transparencia y
competitividad del sistema.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Así las escuelas podrán transformarse en los centros productivos
estratégicos del país porque allí se jugará la ventaja competitiva de las
naciones en el siglo XXI. La educación no sólo reemplazará al suelo fértil y
a los yacimientos de minerales como el recurso clave para el desarrollo y la
creación de riqueza, sino que también será el más significativo determinante
de la eliminación de la pobreza.

<h2>
EXITOSA REFORMA DEL SEGURO SOCIAL
</h2>

José Piñera*
<p>

SANTIAGO DE CHILE <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Está ocurriendo en el mundo una verdadera
revolución social ante el fracaso de los sistemas estatales de pensiones. La
crisis de la seguridad social sobreviene aún en naciones tan prósperas como
Estados Unidos, Alemania y Japón.
<dd>	La buena noticia es que América Latina ha sido pionera en lograr la
solución. Hace 15  años en Chile se instauró un sistema privado de cuentas
de ahorro individuales que conduce a una verdadera seguridad social. En
Perú, Argentina y Colombia se han creado sistemas similares y es posible que
también lo hagan México, Bolivia y El Salvador. Apostaría que casi todos los
países de América Latina ingresarán al siglo XXI con la ventaja competitiva
de un sistema de pensiones privado de capitalización individual.
<dd>	Es conveniente mantener lo esencial del modelo chileno, adaptándolo a la
realidad nacional, especialmente en la definición de la transición desde el
sistema de reparto al de capitalización. Siempre surge la siguiente
pregunta: ¿cuáles son las claves del éxito del modelo chileno de pensiones,
aquellos factores esenciales que deben preservarse en toda reforma?
<dd>	Al celebrar 15 años de funcionamiento del sistema de Administradores de
Fondos de Pensiones (AFP) es oportuno enumerar 20 factores esenciales:
<dd>                1. El sistema tradicional de reparto tiene una falla
estructural al basarse en una visión errada de la conducta humana. Al romper
la relación que debe existir entre esfuerzo y recompensa, el sistema de
reparto origina conductas que producen, tarde o temprano, graves
consecuencias económicas y sociales. El problema sólo se corrige cuando se
crea un sistema donde la pensión de cada persona resulta de su esfuerzo de
ahorro durante la vida de trabajo. Esto además permite ampliar la cobertura
del sistema a trabajadores independientes que quieran participar.
<dd>                2. El sistema de capitalización individual reemplaza
completamente al sistema de reparto. Siempre existe la tentación de
soluciones mixtas, pues algunos suponen que al introducir elementos de dos
concepciones diferentes obtienen lo mejor de ambas. Eso es un error.
Generalmente la solución mixta es un engendro que al carecer de coherencia
interna alimenta contradicciones que ocasionan daños graves. Si la
capitalización es mejor que el reparto, ¿por qué mantener un beneficio
universal entregado por el Estado y financiado con un impuesto a la
contratación de mano de obra?  La coexistencia entre el reparto y la
capitalización tiende a no ser posible, pues le permite a sucesivos
gobiernos mostrar preferencia por un sistema u otro.
<dd>                3. El sistema es administrado por el sector privado. En
Singapur hay un sistema de capitalización individual único administrado por
el "Central Provident Fund" del Estado. Ello tiende al mal uso de los
recursos y es contradictorio con una sociedad libre. 
<dd>                4. Las empresas privadas que operan el sistema de pensiones
-las AFP- son de giro único. No conviene confundir el producto del sistema,
que es una pensión al final de la vida, con los otros productos que ofrece
el sistema financiero. No debe mezclarse la administración de un ahorro
obligatorio y de largo plazo con la inversión de recursos que toleran
niveles de riesgos superiores. En muchos países los sistemas bancarios son
oligopólicos y no es conveniente reproducir esa estructura en el manejo del
sistema de pensiones. Entre las AFP y otras instituciones financieras pueden
haber relaciones contractuales, como convenios de servicios que reduzcan los
costos del sistema, pero se debe mantener la naturaleza única de su giro.
<dd>	5. Los ahorros de los trabajadores reciben la rentabilidad de las
inversiones. Esto es necesario tanto por razones de seguridad como de
estabilidad política del sistema. En efecto, si las AFP pactaran de antemano
una tasa de retorno, podrían quebrar al realizar malas inversiones, poniendo
en peligro los ahorros. Al distinguir entre Administradora (la cual se
financia con una comisión) y Fondo se logra el objetivo. El Fondo de
Pensiones puede tener oscilaciones de rentabilidad, pero en la medida que
esté bien diversificado, esa variación tiene los límites propios de lo que
son las rentabilidades nacionales o mundiales. Así un Fondo de Pensiones no
puede quebrar, aunque sí la Administradora, involucrando en este caso sólo
el capital del empresario. Y al comprender los trabajadores que el valor de
su cuenta de ahorro previsional depende de la buena marcha de las empresas y
de la economía, se logra su adhesión al sistema de pensiones y se estimula
un comportamiento responsable.
<dd>                6. Hay libre entrada de empresas del sector. Las condiciones
competitivas permiten optimizar la eficiencia en la oferta de cualquier bien
o servicio. Además, el sistema de capitalización individual es intensivo en
el procesamiento de información, área en la cual están ocurriendo
vertiginosos avances tecnológicos. La competencia de inversionistas tanto
nacionales como extranjeros asegura que estos avances sean incorporados y
que la reducción de costos sea traspasada a los trabajadores a través de
menores comisiones y mejor servicio.
<dd>	7. El tamaño de cada AFP lo determina el mercado y no límites arbitrarios
impuestos por el gobierno sobre el éxito de cada AFP. Si hay una AFP que
logre una fracción importante del mercado es porque es favorecida por los
propios trabajadores y no porque la autoridad así lo dispuso. Las
deseconomías de escala han impedido la monopolización del mercado.
<dd>	8. No hay AFP estatal, para lo cual no hay justificación. De existir se
produce una competencia desleal con las AFP privadas.
<dd>	9. El trabajador tiene libertad para elegir su AFP. El sistema está basado
en la capacidad de los trabajadores para tomar decisiones sobre la AFP que
le manejará su cuenta de ahorro individual. Australia tiene un sistema
privado, pero  las personas deben afiliarse según el gremio al que
pertenecen, creándose clientes cautivos que no reciben ni el mejor servicio
ni la mejor rentabilidad.
<dd>	10. Las comisiones que cobran las AFP son libres. Los precios son señales
fundamentales en una economía libre. Por lo tanto, las comisiones -el precio
de los servicios que dan las AFP- deben ser determinadas por el mercado
competitivo. En Chile se fortaleció la ley antimonopolio para impedir la
colusión entre empresas en fijar comisiones. Las autoridades deben asegurar
condiciones competitivas, pero no caer en la tentación de fijar los precios,
con todas las distorsiones y presiones que ello genera.
<dd>	11. La transición contempló la libertad para quedarse en el sistema de
reparto o trasladarse al sistema de capitalización. Ello hace más difícil
cuantificar los aspectos fiscales de la transición, pero tiene un gran valor
para las personas y crea confianza.
<dd>	12. Se les reconocen aportes hechos al sistema de reparto a los que optan
por el nuevo sistema. En Chile se aplicó una fórmula transparente y eficaz,
el Bono Reconocimiento que reflejó los beneficios ya ganados por el
trabajador en el sistema de reparto. Esta compensación debe existir para no
penalizar a las personas que ya han hecho aportes sustanciales en el sistema
estatal y prefieren que sus contribuciones futuras vayan a su cuenta de
ahorro individual.
<dd>	13. Los nuevos trabajadores entran al sistema de capitalización porque no
es responsable mantener abierta la puerta de un sistema de reparto que no es
viable en el largo plazo.
<dd>	14. Creación de un organismo fiscalizador tecnificado con los recursos
necesarios, tanto humanos como financieros, para cumplir su función. En
Chile tenemos un organismo altamente profesional y despolitizado, la
Superintendencia de AFP.
<dd>	15. La regulación del sistema ha sido crecientemente liberal. Nuestro
enfoque fue radical pero con una ejecución conservadora. Una vez establecida
la capitalización es prudente enfatizar  la seguridad del nuevo sistema,
mientras se adquiere experiencia. Se impusieron estrictas reglas de
elegibilidad y diversificación de las inversiones que se van liberalizando a
medida que el sistema madura.
<dd>	16. La transparencia es total. La confianza se gana con información plena.
Los trabajadores tienen derecho a saber quiénes son los dueños de las AFP,
en qué invierten los recursos, los niveles de comisiones, etc. Es importante
esta transparencia y posibilita a los dirigentes sindicales asesorar a sus
afiliados y a los analistas, consultores, clasificadores de riesgos e
instituciones financieras emitir opiniones sobre la calidad de los
portafolios de inversión. En Chile, la Superintendencia de AFP publica un
informe mensual que contiene toda la información relevante del sistema.
Además, las AFP están obligadas a proporcionar información periódica a sus
afiliados acerca del estado de sus cuentas.
<dd>	17. La reforma de las pensiones fue parte de un esfuerzo integral de
liberalización de la economía y la sociedad. La capitalización individual
funciona muchísimo mejor si opera en una economía abierta y con mercados
libres. La apertura del mercado de capitales permite a las AFP aprovechar
oportunidades de inversión en el exterior. 
<dd>	18. La reforma fue precedida por un gran esfuerzo comunicacional. Una
reforma de esta naturaleza afecta la vida de los trabajadores. La inquietud
e incertidumbre son inevitables por lo que las autoridades tienen que
explicar el sistema en términos simples pero veraces. Una vez operando, la
función informativa es asumida por las AFP, sus asociaciones y los medios de
comunicación.
<dd>	19. La meta fue lograr el sistema óptimo. Para ello se requiere liderazgo.
No se puede diseñar una reforma de este tipo basándose en encuestas y en un
consenso artificial que diluyen la reforma óptima. El verdadero líder es
aquel que actúa según lo que conviene al país, aun cuando sea impopular en
el corto plazo.
<dd>	20. Estado de "eterna vigilancia": siempre habrán personas, partidos,
corrientes de opinión, grupos de interés que aspiran torcer el sistema en su
beneficio y en desmedro del resto. Hay que defender los principios centrales
del sistema, rechazando cualquier propuesta que vaya en dirección contraria,
manteniendo el esfuerzo educativo y comunicacional.
<dd>	El sistema chileno de pensiones es mucho más que una manera de generar
buenos ingresos para los jubilados, crear ahorro para la economía y
estimular el crecimiento económico. En último término, es un acto de fe en
la libertad de los individuos y en las maravillas que los individuos pueden
hacer cuando son libres.&copy

<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>ESTADOS UNIDOS Y EL FUTURO DE COLOMBIA</H2>
Miguel Posada S.*<p>
BOGOTA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- 	El ingreso de dineros del narcotráfico a la pasada campaña
electoral en Colombia desató una crisis política interna en el país y generó
un deterioro notable en las relaciones del gobierno colombiano con Estados
Unidos. El gobierno norteamericano ha sido actor importante en el proceso
desatado, aplicando presión sobre el gobierno del presidente Samper en
varias formas.
<dd>
Primero vino la descertificación de Colombia como país comprometido con la
lucha antidrogas. Esta descertificación deja el camino abierto al ejecutivo
de Estados Unidos para aplicar las sanciones que estime conveniente contra
el país. Después del proceso en la Cámara de Representantes que absolvió al
presidente Samper, el gobierno norteamericano le retiró al mandatario
colombiano su visa de ingreso a Estados Unidos. Esta sanción, aplicada
además a otros personajes de la vida política nacional, es la última
actuación hasta el momento. Queda encima del gobierno colombiano y del país
la espada de Damocles de las sanciones comerciales. 
<dd>	
En la batalla contra el llamado Cartel de Cali, la policía y las fuerzas
armadas han sido exitosas. Con la excepción de Helmer Herrera, la cúpula del
Cartel está en la cárcel o fue dada de baja. Obviamente quedan muchos narcos
de menor jerarquía por detectar y capturar. Fue precisamente información
contenida en los documentos hallados en los muchos allanamientos realizados
la que aceleró la crisis al revelar la profundidad de la penetración que
había logrado el Cartel en la clase política colombiana. La presión
norteamericana, odiosa por ser externa, ha sido importante para mantener en
marcha este proceso de limpieza, vital para Colombia más que para los mismos
Estados Unidos. 
<dd>	
Indudablemente la incertidumbre causada por la crisis política ha tenido un
costo importante para la economía colombiana. Por otra parte, el daño a las
relaciones bilaterales que se ha producido, no sólo por las actuaciones
concretas, sino por las declaraciones imprudentes de funcionarios de los dos
gobiernos, especialmente las del ministro del Interior Horacio Serpa,
probablemente será subsanable en el mediano plazo. Pero queda el tema de las
sanciones. Aplicarlas sería un grave error por parte del gobierno
norteamericano. El retiro de preferencias arancelarias u otras sanciones de
tipo económico ocasionarían graves daños a la economía colombiana.
Afectarían precisamente a las exportaciones sanas del país. En el campo
político debilitaría a quienes apoyan la limpieza y se abriría el campo a
quienes, apelando a un nacionalismo malsano, conviven y apoyan a los
narcotraficantes y a la guerrilla, esta última convertida hoy en el Tercer
Cartel del narcotráfico.
<dd>	
Es probable que desde Washington sea difícil apreciar la realidad de la
situación política colombiana. El proceso de limpieza, como es apenas
natural, ha generado una polarización y un fraccionamiento político. Hoy no
se ven candidatos serios y competentes dentro de los partidos tradicionales
que tengan buenas probabilidades de tener éxito electoral. Es posible que en
los dos años que faltan para las elecciones presidenciales algunos
candidatos aceptables se puedan perfilar con más claridad, pero una actitud
arrogante y falta de tacto de parte del gobierno de Estados Unidos trabajará
en contra de los buenos candidatos y a favor de otros, populistas o de
ideología de izquierda, cuyo triunfo sería desastroso para el país. La
embajada norteamericana en Colombia tiene la gran responsabilidad de
asesorar bien al Departamento de Estado en la materia. En estos momentos se
requiere firmeza pero también discreción y paciencia de parte de Washington
para no generar una animadversión hacia Estados Unidos que haría difícil la
necesaria colaboración de dos países enfrentados a un enemigo común. ©

<h2>
CHILE: POLITICOS QUIEREN MONOPOLIOS
</h2>
Ciro Quintana*
<p>
SANTIAGO DE CHILE <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Los empresarios están pendientes de las encuestas
y estudios de mercado por la información que ofrecen sobre las orientaciones
y el comportamiento de los consumidores. No ocurre los mismo en el mundo
político, donde se reacciona frente a los sondeos de opinión pública según
sus resultados. Cuando éstos favorecen, las encuestas son un bocado. Por el
contrario, cuando dan en las narices, se acusan los trabajos de sesgados,
muestras mal estructuradas, encuestas no rigurosas o simplemente las ignoran.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Esto último está ocurriendo en Chile. Los políticos sistemáticamente han
venido ignorando los diversos sondeos públicos que reiteradamente reflejan
un creciente desprestigio de la actividad partidaria y desvalorización de
las tareas parlamentarias. La suma de pequeños factores han causado la
brecha, cada vez mayor, que separa a los políticos de la ciudadanía, de lo
cual ningún partido se escapa.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
El elemento que quizá ha ayudado más a construir la mala imagen política a
nivel de opinión pública es la tendencia de los dirigentes de tratar de
aprovechar la infraestructura del Estado para obtener ventajas más en
beneficio propio que en el de sus representados.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dentro de tal línea se inscribe el nuevo intento, esta vez propiciado desde
las propias filas del Poder Ejecutivo, de sacar adelante un proyecto de ley
que permita al Estado entregar recursos para que los partidos políticos
financien sus campañas electorales. Es cierto que la cantidad propuesta -12
millones de dólares- parece insignificante, pero ante la opinión pública
surge como un nuevo intento de escamotear fondos que deben ser destinados a
tareas socialmente más importantes, como por ejemplo mejorar la situación de
los pensionados del viejo sistema estatal (unas 500.000 personas reciben
menos de $100 mensuales) y ampliar las oportunidades de educación y de salud
para los sectores más desposeídos.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
El argumento de los partidarios del financiamiento público de las campañas
electorales es que hay que terminar "con el maridaje obsceno entre el dinero
y la política", es decir, la obtención de financiamiento por vías "oscuras",
ya que en la actualidad la militancia de los partidos es incapaz de
suministrar los fondos necesarios ni siquiera para el mantenimiento del
aparataje mínimo de estos. Otro argumento es que hay que transparentar el
financiamiento de las colectividades políticas.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ninguna de esas justificaciones aguantan el más mínimo análisis. Para que
los partidos se independicen totalmente del apoyo financiero de sectores
privados, o bien de los organismo oficiales, tendrían que recibir del Estado
un aporte financiero superior a los $100 millones. Y tal cantidad generaría
un proceso corruptivo al interior de los partidos que los conduciría al
descalabro moral y ético, como ocurre en otros países donde el Estado
financia la política. En cuanto a la transparencia, ¿alguien cree
ingenuamente que los partidos políticos van a dar a conocer todas las ayudas
recibidas?
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Hay que tomar también en consideración otras consecuencias derivadas de
encauzar recursos del Estado a los partidos políticos. La más relevante es
la monopolización de la representación popular por parte de las actuales
entidades. ¿Qué posibilidades tendrían candidaturas independientes en ese
escenario?  Incluso, ¿qué oportunidades encontrarían los movimientos nuevos
de insertarse en la política?  Sin exagerar, se trata de un camino que
demuestra que los grupos políticos no son amigos de la competencia ni del
libre mercado y prefieren mil veces un esquema oligopólico, donde solamente
puedan participar los ya conocidos o los apadrinados, aun cuando para
obtenerlo deban incurrir en gastos abusivos, financiados a la fuerza por
todos los contribuyentes.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Es sorprendente la actitud del gobierno de Eduardo Frei, la cual señala que
aún no ha comprendido la preocupación general respecto a que el Estado debe
reducir su nivel de gastos, factor que ha impedido que Chile pueda vivir con
tasas de inflación bajas, al nivel de las naciones desarrolladas. <&copy;p>

<H2>CHILE: REDISTRIBUYENDO POBREZA </H2>
Ciro Quintana*<br>
<p>


SANTIAGO DE CHILE (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
Uno de los aspectos más destacados de los dos
gobiernos de la concertación centroizquierda que ha tenido Chile en años
recientes ha sido su reiterada acción en beneficio de los sectores más
desposeídos del país. Ante estudios que sostenían, a comienzos de los 90,
que el 40% de la población sufría de pobreza, las administraciones de
Patricio Aylwin, primero, y ahora Eduardo Frei (hijo) han desplegado una
importante batería de medidas en todos los campos tras la meta de reducir al
mínimo este problema. Ello ha tenido, como contrapartida un incremento
sustancial de impuestos para financiar programas sociales, lo cual ha
catapultado a Chile a alcanzar uno de los primeros puestos en cuanto a carga
impositiva en América Latina (17% del PIB).<p>
Para sorpresa del gobierno, pese a los grandes esfuerzos redistributivos
desplegados, la distribución del ingreso en el país no ha mejorado ni
siquiera una décima en relación al panorama advertido al término del régimen
militar, según el informe de la Comisión Nacional de Justicia y Paz de la
Conferencia Episcopal de Chile. El quintil más rico de la población sigue
recibiendo 58,1% del ingreso, mientras que el más pobre apenas recibe 4,6%.
El gobierno chileno no sabe dónde ha fallado ni conoce el monto de las
filtraciones que impiden que los recursos lleguen efectivamente a quienes
están destinados, los más pobres.<p>
	En todo caso, la denuncia episcopal sirvió de base para reanimar a los
grupos que reclaman mayores impuestos. Para estos, la realidad demuestra la
injusticia de la actual estructura impositiva del país y, por lo tanto,
según ellos se debe acrecentar aún más el aporte de los sectores más
pudientes y lograr así una más justa distribución. Lo que no esperaban estos
sectores es que un estudio efectuado por dos importantes funcionarios de
gobierno, uno de ellos el Subsecretario de Desarrollo Social, reveló que no
había relación alguna entre la más pareja distribución del ingreso y la
proporción de población en situación de pobreza. El estudio se abocó a
investigar la situación de las diversas regiones del país y determinó que en
aquellas regiones donde la distribución es más desigual hay un cuadro de
pobreza menor que la detectada donde el panoramas es más igualitario. Toda
una paradoja que está obligando a replantear el problema de la pobreza y a
comprender que en aquellos lugares donde es permitido que un creciente
número de personas se hagan muy ricas, los pobres se vuelven menos pobres.
Como sostiene el Instituto Libertad y Desarrollo, fundación privada chilena
de estudios públicos, no se combate la pobreza imponiendo una distribución
más igualitaria de los ingresos, con lo cual sólo se logra redistribuir
pobreza, lo que por generaciones ha sucedido bajo todos los regímenes
socialistas de la historia, desde Europa oriental hasta Cuba.<p>
	Lo que se espera es que este segundo gobierno de la Concertación revise sus
métodos, rechace los viejos mitos socialistas y reconozca lo importante que
es construir un camino que motive y facilite la generación de riqueza, único
medio capaz de proporcionar nuevas oportunidades y expectativas a la
población que hoy vive en situación de pobreza. La experiencia demuestra que
aquellos gobiernos que han colocado en primer plano la erradicación de la
pobreza a través de programas del sector público siempre acaban con un
balance deplorable en este campo. ©<p>

<H2>UN NUEVO UNIVERSO MONETARIO</H2>
Richard Rahn*<br>
<p>

WASHINGTON  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--Movilizar dinero anónimamente, a la velocidad de la luz
y a cualquier sitio del mundo va pronto a ser tan fácil como oprimir algunas
teclas en su computadora. Las autoridades fiscales se sienten retadas y
amenazadas por esa nueva tecnología y, como era de esperarse, algunos
funcionarios de los departamentos del Tesoro y de Justicia de Estados Unidos
están proponiendo regulaciones que en esencia obligarían a cada ciudadano o
empresa estadounidense a reportar al gobierno cada ingreso y gasto efectuado
electrónicamente. Ni los nazis ni los soviéticos alcanzaron tal nivel de
entremetimiento. Felizmente, muchos en el Congreso están opuestos a tal
intento de negarnos lo que nos queda de privacidad financiera.<p>
	Estamos en una encrucijada. Mientras los gobiernos más traten de imponernos
impuestos, regularnos, controlarnos y confiscarnos, mayor es el incentivo
del empresario y del inversionista para marcharse. Las nuevas tecnologías
permitirán hacerlo electrónicamente.<p>
	Las transferencias electrónicas reducen drásticamente el costo de
transacciones y la posibilidad de pérdidas. Se adelantan varios
experimentos, uno de ellos en Amsterdam es operado por DigiCash y se llama
E-cash. Individuos podrán mover sus fondos de banco a banco, sin que los
bancos mismos se enteren sobre quién hizo el depósito o de qué país provino.<p>
	Claro que a la oficina de impuestos no le gusta eso, pero el asunto está
fuera de su control. La gente podrá escoger entre dos versiones del futuro.
La primera es la sociedad donde todas sus transacciones pueden ser
monitoreadas por el gobierno. La segunda le permitirá escoger cuáles de sus
transacciones estarán al alcance de ojos curiosos y cuáles se mantendrán en
el anonimato.<p>
	Funcionarios gubernamentales argumentarán que sistemas anónimos benefician
principalmente a los narcotraficantes, lavadores de dinero, terroristas y a
los que no pagan sus impuestos. Los libertarios, por su parte, alertarán del
peligro que presentan los gobiernos con total escrutinio sobre el ciudadano.
Los temores legítimos del gobierno se pueden apaciguar substituyendo el
impuesto sobre la renta con tasas bajas de impuestos a las ventas y
retenciones. De todas maneras, no hay duda que las actuales regulaciones
para acabar con el lavado de dinero están fracasando y ello no justifica la
imposición de restricciones adicionales a legítimas transferencias
efectuadas por ciudadanos honestos, en detrimento de nuestras libertades
civiles.<p>
	Esta revolución electrónica significa que los bancos y otras organizaciones
podrán crear su propio dinero. La definición de dinero como moneda de curso
legal creado por los gobiernos se volverá menos y menos relevante. La
distinción actual entre dinero, bienes, servicios y activos desaparecerá a
medida que se hagan intercambiables.<p>
	Los gobiernos no podrán detener esta revolución porque es mundial y
demasiada gente tiene los conocimientos necesarios. La censura y la
regulación no funcionarán porque el desarrollo de maneras de evadirlas se
mantendrá muy por delante de quienes intentan las restricciones. Por las
mismas razones, los gobiernos totalitarios han dejado de controlar la
información porque la nueva tecnología lo hace imposible de lograr. Los
gobiernos tendrán que admitir que el monopolio de su banco central en la
emisión de monedas desaparecerá de la misma manera que los coches tirados
por caballos.<p>
	La batalla por la libertad financiera no está perdida. Para ganarla hay que
involucrarse en la reforma del sistema impositivo, la abolición del impuesto
sobre la renta y su reemplazo por un sistema que no requiera del constante
escrutinio gubernamental. En la era de pagos cibernérticos no es posible
mantener el actual régimen de impuestos. ©<p>

<H2>SER NUEVAMENTE REELECTO</H2>
William Ratliff*<br>
<p>
 

LIMA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)-- El jefe maoista del norte del Perú, Pedro Sánchez Flores, fue
recientemente capturado mientras trataba de revivir la "guerra popular" de
Sendero Luminoso, el grupo guerrillero más sanguinario de la historia
latinoamericana.<p>
	Pero ese movimiento está moribundo y los grupos que sobreviven están más
interesados en el narcotráfico que en el tráfico de ideas. Esa ha sido una
de las victorias del presidente Alberto Fujimori, capaz de recuperar la
esperanza de la gente a través de cambios revolucionarios. Hablar hoy del
Perú es hablar de Fujimori. Desde que tomó las riendas del país en 1990, ha
acumulado poder en sus propias manos, retando a las élites tradicionales con
una democracia autócrata que es controversial tanto dentro como fuera del país.<p>
	En 1990, Fujimori heredó un país paralizado no sólo por la guerrilla sino
por una total ineptitud en el manejo de la economía, un narcotráfico en auge
y la generalizada desesperación de la gente. Durante su mandato, la
inflación se redujo de 7.500% a 10% anual y el crecimiento económico de los
últimos tres años le ha ganado al Perú el apodo de "jaguar suramericano" de
parte de un importante banquero internacional.<p>
	En una entrevista en el palacio de gobierno, el presidente me dijo que la
mayoría de los estadounidenses no entendían esta revolución, su efectividad,
durabilidad ni el sustento popular. "Profundas diferencias" surgieron entre
Estados Unidos y el Perú luego de 1992 -dijo-, cuando disolvió a un Congreso
elitista que se oponía al cambio. Fujimori insiste en que "la gente hoy
quiere acción, no retórica". La mayoría es "más realista, práctica y honesta
que los políticos" que prometen sin cumplir, ganándose el desprecio general.
Fujimori mantiene que el anterior Congreso había sido elegido bajo un
proceso tan fuertemente controlado por los privilegiados que difícilmente se
podía considerar democrático. Un nuevo Congreso fue electo en 1995,
controlado por quienes apoyan a Fujimori.<p>
	Las encuestas en junio colocaban la aprobación de Fujimori en 65% y muchos
quieren que busque de nuevo la reelección en el año 2000. Pero sus críticos
argumentan que al socavar las instituciones tradicionales, el populismo de
Fujimori ha despojado al país de su base institucional. Para el presidente,
fue más la obra de políticas discriminatorias y rentistas de las élites
políticas, económicas, sociales y religiosas -aún más que el evidente
fracaso del gobierno de Alan García- lo que en 1990 le entregó un país ruinas.<p>
	Como segunda generación de inmigrantes japoneses, Fujimori se identifica
con la ignorada mayoría indígena, la cual responde a su mensaje y liderazgo.
El mismo se sentía excluido "por razones étnicas", concluyendo que la única
manera de hacer que el gobierno sirva a la mayoría de la gente fue
"conscientemente enfrentando a la mayoría marginada contra esa élite". Para
ello, viaja incansablemente a todos los rincones del país. Los resultados
electorales y las encuestas muestran que sus más decididos partidarios son
los más pobres de Lima y del interior del país. Un reciente informe de Banco
Mundial muestra que esos son exactamente los que más se han beneficiado bajo.<p>

<h2>
COMO AYUDAR A LOS NIÑOS 
</h2>

Robert Rector*
<p>

WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Recientemente, el capitolio federal fue el escenario de
la manifestación organizada por el Fondo de Defensa de los Niños. El
objetivo anunciado era llamar la atención sobre la situación de los niños en
este país, mientras que el propósito no anunciado era lograr el continuo
crecimiento del Estado de Bienestar y criticar a los congresistas reformistas.
<dd>	Mientras que la manifestación tenía toda la razón en llamar la atención
sobre la situación de muchos niños estadounidenses, es irónico que los niños
están sufriendo debido a las políticas apoyadas por los organizadores de la
protesta. Los niños sufren porque el Estado de Bienestar izquierdista ha
destrozado los fundamentos morales de los barrios pobres, derrumbando el
matrimonio, destruyendo la ética de trabajo y dejando una estela de
patología social.
<dd>	El fracaso de la Guerra contra la Pobreza surge de su premisa falsa, la
creencia de que la pobreza material es el meollo del problema de los niños
de los barrios. Según este punto de vista, al reducir la pobreza se aumenta
automáticamente el bienestar de los niños, logrando su desarrollo. De igual
manera, como la pobreza es la "causa" del crimen, del fracaso escolar, de la
ilegitimidad, de las drogas y de la erosión de la ética del trabajo, el
aumento de la beneficencia pública reduce no sólo la pobreza sino al mismo
tiempo todos los demás problemas sociales. De tal lógica simplista surgió el
esfuerzo durante 30 años en aumentar los beneficios, expandir la
elegibilidad, crear nuevos programas y aumentar el presupuesto. La
manifestación del Fondo de Defensa de los Niños repitió toda esta vieja
cantaleta.
<dd>	Pero la historia impugna esa ingenua creencia. En 1950, casi una tercera
parte de la población de Estados Unidos era pobre (el doble de la tasa
actual). En 1920, más o menos la mitad de la población era pobre según el
estándar actual. Si fuera verdad que la pobreza material es la causa de los
problemas sociales, debiéramos haber tenido problemas muchos más graves en
esas épocas que ahora, cuando la realidad es todo lo contrario: el crimen,
la disolución de la familia y la mayoría de los demás problemas sociales no
eran la sombra de los que confrontamos hoy.
<dd>	Tanto la historia como el sentido común indican que los valores y las
habilidades existentes en las familias y no sus ingresos son los que
determinan el rendimiento de los niños. Las familias exitosas tienden a
tener valores sólidos en cuanto al autocontrol, postergar placeres, trabajo,
educación y matrimonio, todo lo cual traspasan a sus hijos. El intento de
aumentar artificialmente el ingreso familiar beneficia muy poco a los niños,
pero va lejos en su destrucción de los mismos valores que son claves para el
éxito. El punto que la izquierda rehusa reconocer es que la beneficencia
pública tiene efectos secundarios: engendra dependencia e ilegitimidad que
son nefastos para el desarrollo de los niños. Por ejemplo, entre las casi 5
millones de familias que reciben beneficios, el tiempo que están bajo esos
programas promedia casi 13 años. Según el informe en 1994 de June O'Neill,
la directora de la Oficina de Presupuesto del Congreso, aumentar el lapso en
que un niño recibe beneficencia pública puede reducir su inteligencia en
20%. O'Neill deja muy claro que es la dependencia de la beneficencia y no la
pobreza lo que realmente hace daño a los niños.
<dd>	Al pagar más a las mujeres para que tengan más hijos fuera del matrimonio,
la beneficencia pública juega un papel importante en la promoción de la
ilegitimidad. Nacer fuera del matrimonio y crecer en un hogar con una madre
soltera triplica los problemas emocionales y de comportamiento entre los
niños, a la vez que también triplica su actividad sexual, dobla la
probabilidad de que las niñas tengan hijos fuera del matrimonio y que los
niños incurran en actividades delictivas que los hará terminar en la cárcel.
<dd>	No es posible ayudar a los niños persistiendo en políticas equivocadas. El
sistema actual de beneficencia pública tiene que ser reemplazado y hay que
terminar con el crecimiento automático de los gastos en beneficencia. La
beneficencia no puede continuar siendo una calle de una sola vía; los
beneficiarios tienen que trabajar para recibir la ayuda. Hay que reducir la
ilegitimidad restringiendo las dádivas en efectivo a las muchachas solteras
con hijos.
<dd>	Las instituciones religiosas han sido dramáticamente exitosas en reducir la
actividad sexual de los jóvenes, el delito, las drogas y demás problemas.
Una manera de darle acceso a los pobres a tales fuentes de esperanza es a
través de vales que puedan ser utilizados por las familias pobres para
mandar a sus hijos a escuelas privadas, incluyendo escuelas religiosas.
<dd>	Pero la ciudadanía debe recordar que el bien intencionado gobierno grande
que quiere mantener una izquierda que apoda a los reformistas como
"anti-niños" está promocionando justamente todo aquello que daña a nuestra
juventud: la beneficencia pública.&copy

<h2>
LA CRISIS DEL SEGURO SOCIAL
</h2>     
     
     
Paul Craig Roberts*
<p>

WASHINTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Si los ciudadanos y sus representantes en el gobierno no
encaran la situación del Seguro Social, no habrá futuro para los
pensionados. El Seguro Social siempre ha sido una pirámide fraudulenta y se
está desmoronando.
<dd>	El Seguro Social "funcionó" durante medio siglo por dos razones básicas: el
programa se originó cuando la población trabajadora era muy grande en
proporción al número de retirados cobrando beneficios y los impuestos a la
nómina necesarios para financiar esos beneficios eran bajos.
<dd>	Al pasar el tiempo, la longevidad ha aumentado y la tasa de nacimiento se
ha reducido. La población en general se tornó más vieja y la proporción de
trabajadores a pensionados se ha reducido. Para compensar todo esto, el
impuesto a la nómina ha ido aumentando hasta alcanzar 15,3%. Y para mantener
la pirámide ese impuesto tendría que ser doblado para el año 2040. Varios
factores hacen eso imposible.
<dd>	Sería un peso impositivo imposible de aguantar y añadido al impuesto sobre
la renta y a otros impuestos no le dejarían gran cosa a las familias para
vivir. Otro factor es el impacto sobre el nivel de empleo. Los impuestos a
la nómina son impuestos al empleo. En el pasado, la combinación de alta
productividad, falta de competencia extranjera e impuestos a la nómina
relativamente bajos impidió que muchos estadounidenses perdieran sus
trabajos, pero la situación de hoy es diferente. Los impuestos ahora son
altos, la productividad ya no es tan superior a la de otros países y la
competencia extranjera ha crecido con la desaparición del socialismo.
<dd>	A partir del año 2012, el Seguro Social no podrá pagar los beneficios
prometidos a menos que el gobierno cubra el déficit pidiendo prestado. Pero
igual como hay un límite a los impuestos a la nómina, existe también un
límite a la habilidad del gobierno para endeudarse y pagar así los
beneficios del Seguro Social. El déficit se dispararía y prestarle
crecientes cantidades al gobierno sería visto como una mala y arriesgada
inversión.
<dd>	Pero la mayor barrera contra la continuación del actual sistema piramidal
del Seguro Social es la necesidad que tiene la economía de Estados Unidos de
nuevas inversiones para mantener su posición competitiva en el mundo. Un
verdadero sistema de pensiones aporta los fondos que le permiten a la
economía crecer, pero nuestro Seguro Social es un sistema de transferencias
diseñado para cubrir los gastos de vida y hospitalización de los mayores.
<dd>	Hay una sola manera de prevenir el colapso del Seguro Social y esa es
convertirlo en un verdadero sistema de jubilación. El monto proveniente del
impuesto a la nómina sería invertido en un fondo de pensiones a nombre de
cada trabajador. Esto le daría seguridad al trabajador y aportaría a la
economía los fondos requeridos para inversión.
<dd>	La transición sería difícil, pero se puede hacer si comenzamos ahora. La
transición tendría que ser financiada con un superávit fiscal para pagar los
beneficios de aquellos que se acercan a la edad de jubilación y cuyo dinero
fue utilizado para pagar a otros que se retiraron antes.
<dd>	El gobierno nos ha venido engañando. Nos promete una jubilación a cambio de
un impuesto de 15,3% a la nómina, pero no puede cumplir. A menos que se
privatice el sistema, la población va a quedarse con altos impuestos y sin
ningún beneficio. &copy;

<H2>ESPAÑA: EL CAMINO DE LA PROSPERIDAD</H2>
L. Jacobo Rodríguez* <br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
El nuevo gobierno español, elegido en marzo en reemplazo
de los socialistas que ocuparon el poder por 14 años y dejaron la economía
en estado caótico, se apresura a cumplir con las estipulaciones de la moneda
única europea. Estos requisitos, que los países de la Unión Europea deben
cumplir para finales de 1997 para poder ingresar como miembros fundadores de
la Unión Monetaria Europea (UME), exigen que la deuda pública no sobrepase
el 60% del PIB, que el déficit fiscal no pase del 3% del PIB y que la tasa
de inflación no sea más que punto y medio superior a las tasas más bajas de
los países miembros.
<P>Con una deuda pública equivalente al 65% del PIB, un déficit fiscal
estimado este año en 4% del PIB y una tasa de inflación de medio punto por
encima del objetivo, las posibilidades son buenas de que España cumpla. Sin
embargo, tratar simplemente de remendar el Estado de Bienestar no es una
alternativa viable, ya que dejaría a España en desventaja competitiva frente
a sus socios europeos. Por el contrario, el nuevo gobierno debe instrumentar
reformas de mercado que fomenten el crecimiento económico, aumenten la tasa
de empleo y atraigan de nuevo la inversión extranjera.
<P>Lamentablemente, los políticos españoles están poniendo demasiado énfasis
en alcanzar los requisitos de la UME, en vez de enfrentar los defectos
estructurales de la economía que condujeron a una tasa de desempleo del
22,4%.  Por ejemplo, en vez de eliminar programas públicos costosos e
innecesarios, el gobierno está tratando de reducir el déficit a 3%
congelando los salarios de los funcionarios públicos. Tales "soluciones"
pueden lograr que España entre precariamente en la UME a finales de 1997,
pero el nuevo presidente del gobierno, José María Aznar, debería más bien
reducir substancialmente el papel del Estado en la economía.
<P>Algunos pasos se han dado, incluyendo gestiones para privatizar algunas
empresas estatales. Pero hay que ir más lejos porque el Estado de Bienestar
español ha fracasado miserablemente. Aznar deberá afrontar con coraje la
crisis antes que ese Estado de Bienestar colapse por su propio peso. 
<P>Hay que reformar el sistema público de pensiones, liberalizar el mercado
laboral y simplificar el código fiscal. El actual sistema de pensiones
consume cerca del 10% del PIB y va camino a la quiebra. Si las pensiones se
mantienen a los actuales niveles, ellas de por sí producirán un déficit
equivalente al 4% del PIB para el año 2025. Y, dadas las tendencias
demográficas de España, reducir los beneficios de los actuales o futuros
pensionistas o aumentar las cotizaciones de los trabajadores (actualmente
28% de la nómina) no evitará la quiebra. Esta es la conclusión de un estudio
recientemente publicado por el Círculo de Empresarios.  
<P>Ese estudio muestra que tanto los trabajadores como los empresarios se
beneficiarían con la instrumentación de un sistema de capitalización
individual, fiscalmente viable y similar al exitoso sistema chileno.  Pero
el Sr. Aznar ha declarado que cualquier reforma de las pensiones se hará
dentro del marco del actual sistema público de reparto.
<P>Si la crisis del sistema de pensiones comienza ahora a hacerse evidente, la
crisis en el mercado laboral ha plagado a España durante años.  España tiene
la tasa de desempleo más alta del mundo industrializado. Las amplias
regulaciones estatales diseñadas para ayudar a los trabajadores y a los que
buscan empleos han resultado contraproducentes. Costosas leyes sobre
despidos y vacaciones han aumentado exageradamente el costo de la mano de
obra y disminuido la tasa de empleo fijo.
<P>También falta que la nueva administración fije una política fiscal clara.
El reemplazo de la tasa máxima del impuesto sobre ganancias de capital de
56% por una única del 20% fue seguida por aumentos de impuestos al tabaco y
bebidas alcohólicas, y  se esperan aumentos al agua y las medicinas.
<P>No se ha adelantado en las promesas electorales de reformar el código
fiscal. Más bien, el gobierno ha tratado de extraer más fondos del sector
privado combatiendo la evasión de impuestos. Habría mayor cumplimiento si la
estructura del código fiscal, que tiene 17 tramos, se simplificase y si la
tasa marginal del 56% fuera reducida.
<P>Si bien es cierto que la UME ofrece beneficios, hoy la economía española no
está en posición de disfrutarlos y probablemente tampoco lo estará a finales
de 1997. El nuevo gobierno servirá mejor al pueblo español si adopta
reformas de mercado, en lugar de tratar de salvar a un sistema
socioeconómico fracasado. Los españoles eligieron a Aznar porque estaban
cansados de la corrupción causada por la política estatista e
intervencionista del gobierno de Felipe González. Solamente un golpe de
timón permitirá a España satisfacer las aspiraciones de sus ciudadanos. ©

<h2>
VENEZUELA: CRONICA DE DOS AJUSTES
</h2>
Carlos Sabino*
<p>
CARACAS <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Los llamados "paquetes de ajuste" en Venezuela tienden a
parecerse mucho, como dos gotas de agua. Ello ocurre por motivos bastante
definidos. Los dos programas de ajuste económico -el que comenzó Carlos
Andrés Pérez en febrero de 1989 y tuvo que detener tres años después, y el
que se inició hace un mes bajo la presidencia de Rafael Caldera- se han
encaminado a resolver problemas fiscales y cambiarios apremiantes, que ya no
admitían dilación. Pérez se encontró con un régimen cambiario controlado que
generaba una disparidad enorme entre el precio del dólar oficial y el que se
transaba libremente, en tanto que Caldera volvió a imponer el control de
cambios para darse cuenta, año y medio después, que le resultaba imposible
sostenerlo; tanto en 1989 como en 1996 las arcas fiscales estaban
prácticamente agotadas y no había recursos para cumplir con los compromisos
más inmediatos del estado. En ambas ocasiones se han presentado amplios
"programas sociales" que, bien mirados, no son sino simples transferencias
indiscriminadas de dinero para reducir los costos políticos de quienes toman
las medidas.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
No extrañará por ello que ambos liberaran el mercado cambiario y que se
hayan levantado algunos subsidios que resultaba imposible mantener, como el
de la gasolina, por ejemplo. No hay en esto ninguna propuesta ideológica de
fondo, ningún modelo de sociedad que se trate de desarrollar. Cuando las
cuentas no salen es preciso reducir los gastos, aumentar los ingresos o
combinar de alguna manera ambas cosas. Se trata de una vieja receta conocida
desde el tiempo de los fenicios.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Este tipo de ajustes, importantes y necesarios como puedan ser, no bastan
sin embargo para definir una política económica de largo plazo, pues se
dirigen simplemente a resolver el problema coyuntural. Detrás de éste,
escondidas a la vista del observador superficial, se encuentran las
verdaderas causas que llevan a los países a situaciones de "desajuste" que
luego se hace imperioso remediar.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
En Venezuela, estas causas tienen directa relación con el papel asfixiante
que tiene el estado frente a la sociedad civil. Este no sólo posee el
petróleo y otras industrias fundamentales (acero, aluminio, electricidad,
etc.), así como una buena proporción de todos los terrenos existentes, sino
que emplea al 20% de la población activa total, regula y controla toda
actividad imaginable y se caracteriza por una ineficiencia descomunal.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Modificar esta maquinaria poderosa, pero incapaz de una acción efectiva, es
la tarea central que tiene la sociedad venezolana. No se trata entonces de
aumentar los impuestos, pues si bien con ello se mejoran las cuentas
fiscales se siguen ahogando y contrayendo las actividades productivas, ni de
vender algunas empresas públicas que están quebradas o dan pérdidas. Se
trata de emprender un verdadero cambio estructural, de privatizar todo
aquello que puede ser gestionado eficientemente por los particulares, de
modificar la arbitraria legislación que tenemos, de reducir drásticamente el
tamaño de la burocracia pública.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Si esto no se realiza volveremos, en poco tiempo, a una situación parecida
a la que teníamos hace un mes: el estado gastará los nuevos recursos que
reciba, volverá a endeudarse y sus cuentas, finalmente, se desequilibrarán
otra vez. De nuevo habrá que emprender un ajuste, devaluar, subir los
precios de los servicios públicos y aumentar los impuestos, empobreciendo
aún más a la sufrida sociedad venezolana.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Venezuela, otra vez, como hace siete años, está soportando la inflación y
la recesión que producen estos ajustes. El sacrificio de nada servirá, como
no sirvió en la ocasión anterior, si no se avanza una modificación
estructural de la economía del país. <p>&copy;

<h2>
SE CAE LA PRIVATIZACIÓN EN MEXICO
</h2>     
     
     
Roberto Salinas-León*
<p>

CIUDAD DE MEXICO <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- La polémica sobre la privatización de la
petroquímica mexicana se ha polarizado entre aquellos que celebran el
monopolio estatal de la industria petrolera como símbolo de soberanía
nacional y los que reclaman nuevas estrategias para capitalizar y modernizar
uno de los sectores más atrasados, pero con mayor potencial de crecimiento
en la economía mexicana.
<dd>	Este es otro de tantos dramas que ha sufrido nuestra economía desde el
estallido de la crisis financiera. La privatización es una forma de aumentar
la productividad de las empresas, de permitir que el gobierno elimine
derroches presupuestales y se logren atraer nuevas inversiones de capital
productivo. Sin embargo, la mayoría de los mexicanos ven la privatización
con malos ojos, más como un instrumento de amiguismo para privilegiar a unos
pocos a costa de un pueblo desesperado y empobrecido.
<dd>	Por otra parte, la ciudadanía percibe que la llamada soberanía nacional se
manipula a conveniencia,  para que líderes corporativistas y sindicales
mantengan su poder personal, ya que lo que se anuncia como propiedad de "la
Nación" no es en realidad propiedad de nadie. Los grupos de oposición
(sindicatos, intelectuales de izquierda, representantes de la burocracia
mexicana) proponen realizar un referéndum sobre si se debe privatizar o no
las plantas petroquímicas. Pero más que un referéndum lo que se necesita es
ampliar la propiedad de esas empresas entre numerosas personas y grupos. Así
se ha hecho con éxito en países como Chile, Inglaterra y la República Checa,
donde la venta de empresas a los trabajadores y entre las clases más
humildes produjo un fuerte apoyo a la iniciativa privatizadora.
<dd>	Es desafortunado que el debate se haya centrado sobre si se debe privatizar
la petroquímica o no, en vez de cómo se debe realizar una necesaria
privatización. La realidad es que las empresas llamadas "privadas" tienden a
ser más públicas que las empresas "públicas", las cuales tienden a estar
bajo el férreo control y funcionar para beneficio de burócratas y políticos.
La industria petrolera mexicana es un triste ejemplo de todo esto.
<dd>	Claro que si la privatización se concibe como PRI-vatización, es decir,
como medio para fortalecer el esquema mercantilista mexicano, donde el
precio y los ingresos para el fisco son las principales prioridades, como
sucedió con la privatización de la banca, entonces el referéndum debería dar
un voto negativo. Pero sería muy diferente si la privatización abarca un fin
popular, de privatizar la propiedad de la petroquímica entre el más amplio
sector posible.
<dd>	En realidad, el fiel cumplimiento de una privatización bien estructurada es
más importante que el precio en sí de la venta. Es fundamental usar la
privatización como medio de acceso universal a la propiedad, preferiblemente
por un número significativo de nuevos accionistas. En México, la motivacióndel proceso no es popular ni mucho menos de aumentar la tenencia de
propiedad entre un creciente sector ajeno a los corredores del poder
gubernamental. Se habla, más bien, de la "reestructuración" del sector
público y de la "racionalización de la participación estatal en la economía".
<dd>	El esquema que se pretende usar en el caso de la petroquímica no respeta la
necesidad de diversificar la estructura accionaria de las empresas entre la
población y la falta de apoyo obligó al gobierno zedillista a revocar la
participación de empresas extranjeras, aun cuando estas son las que podrían
contribuir más a la modernización del sector petroquímico. Ello significó un
triunfo parcial para los antagonistas jurásicos del falso nacionalismo que
tanto daño le han hecho a México. &copy;

<h2>
GUERRILLA COLOMBIANA JUEGA AL ANTISAMPERISMO
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Enrique Santos Calderón
</a>

<P>
BOGOTA (AIPE).- La guerrilla colombiana había estado sospechosamente
quieta. A lo mejor pensaba que atacar a Samper era hacerle el juego a los
gringos. O que si cayera este Gobierno se subirían los militares.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Pero ya no parece tener esas dudas. La masacre de los 11 policías en el
pueblo de Chalán mediante la utilización de un "burro-bomba" (lo único que
faltaba), marcó el inicio de una ofensiva que continuó el "paro armado", con
su trágico saldo de 25 muertos, buses y camiones incendiados, oleoductos
volados, puentes destruidos... 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Según un panfleto del ELN, el objetivo es presionar la salida del
presidente Samper, lo que indica que la guerrilla ya reconoce el acelerado
desprestigio del Gobierno y procura sacar dividendos políticos enarbolando
también la bandera del antisamperismo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Pero, no gracias. El país deliberante, que entiende la necesidad del
retiro del presidente, no acepta estos métodos, ni requiere a estos aliados.
Entre otras cosas porque el antisamperismo de la subversión es producto del
oportunismo de pescar en río revuelto, y no de una convicción sobre las
razones de índole ética y política que precipitaron esta crisis.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La guerrilla se encontró con una coyuntura que ahora piensa puede
resultarle favorable. No la buscó, ni la propició, y casi ni la entiende. Le
pegó tan de frente, a pesar de ella. Otra muestra de como no logra
conectarse con el país real. Para la subversión todos los gobiernos son
iguales. No diferencia, ni matiza. No le interesa la reforma, sino la
destrucción del sistema. Por eso no puede contribuir a la solución de la
crisis ni aprovechar siquiera una coyuntura que debería serles muy propicia
a quienes invocan la lucha contra la corrupción, la opresión y la injusticia
para justificar actos violentos.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;En efecto, con un gobierno desprestigiado y acorralado, sin credibilidad
interna ni externa, y sin recursos ya para el populismo social; sin una
oposición que esté en condiciones de movilizar a la gente o convertirse en
alternativa creíble, era de suponer que quienes llevan 30 años luchando con
las armas dizque por un país mejor fueran por lo menos capaces de formular
una propuesta realista.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pero, qué va. La crisis no ha sido sino nueva oportunidad para reafirmar su
vocación violenta y su naturaleza destructiva; para comprobar su grado de
despolitización y bandolerización; para seguir haciendo, en fin, lo que
mejor hacen: matar, secuestrar, dinamitar. Ya no parece interesarles nada
más: ni el poder, ni el bienestar popular, ni los intereses nacionales.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La guerrilla sigue manejando, claro, un discurso político. Ejerce control
sobre amplias zonas del territorio nacional donde el Estado brilla por su
ausencia. Y tiene la base social que le ofrecen la marginalidad y pobreza de
una población que nada tiene que perder. Y es que para un jornalero del
campo o un marginado urbano ingresar a la subversión puede significar
incluso una mejoría en sus condiciones de vida.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Mientras no cambien estas circunstancias objetivas, la guerrilla tendrá
siempre carne de cañón para alimentar sus filas. Y podrá camuflar la
impresionante perversión de sus ideales invocando motivos sociales y causas
patrióticas. Lo grave es que la situación del país, la parálisis del
Gobierno el agotamiento del presupuesto social, el deterioro de la economía
y demás signos de la crisis, indican que, lejos de mejorar, estas
condiciones pueden empeorar.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La guerrilla ya lo sabe y por eso promovió un "paro armado". Que fue una
forma de medir su fuerza y la del gobierno. Y si bien su poder de
convocatoria resultó escaso, porque carece de credibilidad política, si
demostró su poder de intimidación en muchas regiones del país.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Lo del paro representa un audaz paso en su estrategia de confrontación
total. Consciente de la debilidad del Gobierno, la subversión quiere ampliar
el escenario de la guerra. Y todo indica que es lo que puede suceder. Basta
ver cómo los grupos de autodefensa también se multiplican y anuncian que van
a incrementar sus acciones contra la guerrilla.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Sin capacidad de liderazgo en la cúpula del Estado; sin estrategia de
guerra ni política de paz, y con unas Fuerzas Armadas afectadas también por
el recorte presupuestal, no es nada halagador el panorama que se vislumbra
en materia de orden público en Colombia.

<H2>EL GRAN GOBIERNO EN RETROCESO</H2>
Chris Sarlo*<br>
<p>
VANCOUVER, CANADA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Se nota la tendencia hacia menos regulaciones y
gobiernos más pequeños. Aunque el tamaño y alcance del gobierno tienden a
subir y bajar, lo que Robert Nozick llama "el zigzagueo de la política",
podemos decir que una contracción gubernamental permanente se lleva adelante
en Canadá, Estados Unidos, partes de Europa, en el sur de Asia, Nueva
Zelanda y, más recientemente, en Israel.<p>
	Parecen haber tres razones fundamentales en la reducción del tamaño del
estado: filosófica, económica y pragmática. Filosóficamente se puede
argumentar que una vez dejado atrás los eufemismos, el estado es básicamente
un instrumento coercitivo que restringe la libertad individual y la
creatividad. En términos económicos, el caso es que la intervención
gubernamental reduce la eficiencia de la economía, lo cual resulta en menos
empleos y un nivel de vida más bajo. La razón pragmática es sencilla: una
inmensa deuda pública y la inconveniencia política de aumentar los impuestos
significa que el gobierno tiene que recortar sus gastos. En Canadá predomina
esta última razón. La deuda obliga a reducir el tamaño del estado.<p>0
	Cualquiera que sea la motivación, la contracción del estado se puede hacer
bien o mal. Un ejemplo de lo último es la llamada política de "contrato
social", donde se tratan de reducir gastos sin reducir el número de
funcionarios públicos. Ese camino confronta graves problemas. Primero, parte
de la causa de la deuda pública es que el gobierno es demasiado grande, hay
demasiada gente trabajando en el sector público. Se llega a esa situación
por creer que no hay problema que no pueda ser resuelto con la creación de
una nueva agencia, comisión o superintendencia.<p>
	En estos asuntos hay que preguntarse si lo que queremos que el gobierno
haga por nosotros lo podemos nosotros mismos hacer mejor. ¿Acaso en este o
aquel campo el mercado y los arreglos particulares de la gente pueden
producir mejores resultados que la acción estatal? De ser así, tenemos que
resistir la tentación de pedir que el gobierno lo haga. Todas las sociedades
deben hacerse periódicamente esta pregunta clave.<p>
	Probablemente habrá un consenso sobre las principales funciones del estado,
respecto a las funciones de la policía, justicia y defensa nacional. Habrá
también consenso sobre exclusiones. En Canadá, por ejemplo, cada día hay más
oposición a que el gobierno confiera subsidios a empresas privadas,
incluyendo la agricultura. Y el financiamiento gubernamental de grupos de
presión es cada día más criticado. También es ahora políticamente posible la
privatización de servicios públicos como el correo y el sistema de pensiones
del Seguro Social.<p>
	El verdadero debate surge en las áreas de salud, beneficencia, regulación y
ayuda extranjera. Mientras no está clara la necesidad de tener monopolios
estatales en esas áreas, no será fácil combatir los argumentos en favor de
la intervención estatal. Lo que sí sabemos es que los adelantos tecnológicos
hacen cada día más viable la privatización y la eliminación de regulaciones.<p>
	Una vez que hayamos decidido cuál es el papel apropiado para el gobierno,
hay que eliminar todas las demás funciones que no se justifican. Claro que
hay que proceder con compasión y ello incluye campañas de entrenamiento de
empleados públicos para que se puedan ganar la vida en otras actividades.<p>
	La reconsideración periódica del papel del estado, con el propósito de ir
pasando funciones al sector privado que éste pueda llevar a cabo con mayor
eficiencia, es algo esencial para todas las naciones que quieran evitar los
costosos errores del pasado. <p>

<title>Sheehan: Un Departamento de Estado Verde</title>

<h2>
UN DEPARTAMENTO DE ESTADO VERDE
</h2>     
     
     
James H. Sheehan*
<p>

WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- El secretario de Estado Warren Christopher ha declarado
la protección mundial del medio ambiente como principio fundamental de la
política exterior de Estados Unidos. En discursos recientes, el Sr.
Christopher anunció la "Iniciativa Ambiental para el siglo XXI", como agenda
ambiciosa de las iniciativas diplomáticas verdes que tiene la intención de
promover con renovado vigor por todo el mundo.
<dd>	Esta política ha sido "considerablemente influenciada" por el
vicepresidente Al Gore, de donde provienen muchas de las iniciativas
ambientales de la administración Clinton. Tal influencia comenzó con el
nombramiento de Tim Wirth al cargo de subsecretario de Estado para asuntos
mundiales. Más recientemente, Christopher ordenó el comienzo de la promoción
de una ideología amistosa hacia la Tierra por parte del Departamento de
Estado. Y en marzo hizo un peregrinaje a Brasil para demostrar su compromiso
con los bosques tropicales.
<dd>	La administración Clinton está usando el medio ambiente como tema para
atacar al Congreso Republicano y sus abortados planes de reformar la
política ambiental y de recortar el presupuesto en esta área. Creyendo que
el ambientalismo es un buen tema electoral, Christopher ha propuesto
restricciones internacionales a los bosques, océanos y al uso de materias
químicas. Los activistas ambientales aplauden estas propuestas como un muy
esperado adelanto. Pero no van a ser muy populares entre el público. Muchos
estadounidenses se voltearon contra Clinton en las últimas elecciones
parlamentarias porque medidas excesivas de este tipo dañan la economía y
devalúan sus propiedades. La terca insistencia en este tema muestra la
inconexión del gobierno con el votante común.
<dd>	Mientras los estadounidenses han señalado sus deseos de menores impuestos y
un gobierno más pequeño, el Departamento de Estado exige más dinero para ser
gastado en programas burocráticos de las Naciones Unidas y del Banco
Mundial. Los estadounidenses no quieren gastar el dinero de sus impuestos
para sostener a gobiernos extranjeros ni para subsidiar a las grandes
corporaciones.
<dd>	Luego de un invierno congelado, el Departamento de Estado apoya
restricciones a la utilización de energía a través del Tratado de las
Naciones Unidas sobre Cambio Climático. Se estima que las propuestas del
Departamento de Estado para regular el uso de combustibles como el petróleo
y el carbón costarán 600.000 puestos de trabajo y añadirán un dólar al
precio de cada galón de gasolina. La protesta pública por el costo de la
gasolina recientemente llevó al Congreso a tratar de rebajar los impuestos
aumentados por Clinton. Si la utilización de combustibles contribuye al
efecto invernadero, entonces el viento polar que sopla sobre Estados Unidos
durante el invierno debiera ser menos frío en vez de más frío.
<dd>	El Departamento de Estado quiere que el Senado ratifique el Tratado de
Biodiversidad, que contiene cláusulas sobre inventarios nacionales de la
flora y la fauna, reviviendo viejas propuestas de planificación central por
parte de los gobiernos sobre el uso de la tierra. Además de imponer onerosas
regulaciones a la biotecnología, la ratificación del Senado obligaría a los
contribuyentes a subsidiar restricciones similares en países extranjeros.
<dd>	La agenda verde del secretario Christopher incluye la participación de
Estados Unidos en la reciente Cumbre de la Ciudad, Habitat II, llevada a
cabo en Estambul. Esta fue otra de una serie de conferencias de las Naciones
Unidas sobre el ambiente, la población, la pobreza y los derechos de las
mujeres. En Estambul se trató de conseguir el consenso de que el "desarrollo
sostenible" se convierta en principio fundamental en el desarrollo de las
ciudades y, al igual que en las anteriores conferencias, las discusiones
tuvieron que ver con la redistribución mundial del ingreso y mayor
intervención de los gobiernos en la economía.
<dd>	El intento de la administración Clinton de mezclar cuestiones ambientales
con relaciones diplomáticas está destinado al fracaso. Los estadounidenses
no favorecen mayores gastos en programas internacionales. Aunque algunos
gobiernos extranjeros serán tentados a colaborar con el presidente Clinton,
con la esperanza de recibir asistencia financiera, otros se darán cuenta que
las consecuencias de tales imposiciones ambientales conllevan costosas
restricciones al crecimiento económico y al desarrollo. A fin de cuentas,
todo eso representa niveles inaceptables de intervención extranjera en los
asuntos internos de naciones soberanas e independientes. &copy;

<h2>
UNIVERSIDADES QUE ENGAÑAN A LOS ESTUDIANTES
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
spanbio
.html">
William E. Simon
</a>

<P>
NUEVA YORK (AIPE).- Actualmente hay casi 15 millones de estudiantes en las
universidades de Estados Unidos. Como nación gastamos anualmente casi
$170.000 millones en estudios superiores. El costo de una educación
universitaria de cuatro años fluctúa, según la universidad seleccionada,
entre $50.000 y $100.000 y los costos siguen en aumento.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A pesar del financiamiento de fuentes privadas y públicas, una buena
educación universitaria es una inversión considerable para la clase media y
conseguir el dinero requerido es una fuente de angustia para muchos padres.
Pero, ¿qué están recibiendo los estudiantes, los padres y el público a
cambio de esa inversión? La triste verdad es que mientras más jóvenes creen
que es esencial tener un título universitario, aunque signifique una pesada
deuda, más y más instituciones superiores ofrecen cursos de estudios que la
mayoría de los estadounidenses que viven en el mundo real encuentran sin
sentido y sin contenido práctico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Recientemente la National Association of Scholars (NAS), un grupo de
profesores que laboran en reforzar las normas académicas, presentaron un
informe desbastador, mostrando hasta donde las principales universidades han
desmantelado rigurosos requisitos que los estudiantes tenían antes que
cumplir para graduarse.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En su investigación sobre los programas de estudios de 50 universidades,
NAS reporta una disminución constante desde los años 60 en requisitos
específicos que antes introducían a los estudiantes a conocimientos básicos
en áreas claves.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En lugar de los requisitos básicos en los primeros dos años exigidos hace
una generación, que se fundamentaban en estudios de literatura inglesa,
historia de la civilización occidental, idiomas extranjeros, ciencias,
matemáticas y religión, a los estudiantes de hoy en las más famosas
universidades se les da entera libertad para que ocupen su tiempo asistiendo
a una variedad de cursos que están de moda y cuyo contenido consternaría a
estudiantes y profesores de una generación atrás. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;El requisito de un idioma extranjero ha sido abolido por muchas de nuestras
mejores universidades. En 1964, por ejemplo, 90% de las universidades
exigían cursos en ciencias naturales, pero para 1994 el número se había
reducido a 34% y en matemáticas la obligatoriedad se redujo durante el mismo
período de 36% a 12%.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;La duración del año escolar se ha reducido de 191 días de clases en 1964 a
156 en 1993. La proporción de universidades con clases los sábados cayó de
79% a 6% y hasta las clases los viernes son hoy poco frecuentes en algunas
universidades. La duración de las clases también se ha reducido.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Los profesores se han dado cuenta que a medida que se reducen los
requisitos, ellos tienen que dedicarle menos tiempo a los estudiantes,
dedicándolo más bien a investigación especializada. Al reducir normas
difíciles, los administradores mejoran la retención de estudiantes, lo cual
es importante a medida que aumenta la competencia entre universidades.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No hay duda de que todo este proceso comenzó durante las rebeliones
estudiantiles de los años 60, cuando los activistas se burlaban de los
programas tradicionales de estudios, tachándolos de irrelevantes en sus
grandiosos proyectos de cambio revolucionario.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Es irónico que cuando necesitamos de una educación rigurosa para competir
en un exigente mercado mundial, nuestras universidades están eliminando
requisitos y añadiendo cursos sin valor alguno. También es irónico que ha
medida que el resto del mundo adopta los ideales políticos y económicos de
la cultura occidental, nuestras instituciones académicas se ocupan de
repudiarlos.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Afortunadamente contamos con la ayuda de grupos como NAS, a la vez que
padres, estudiantes y funcionarios públicos comienzan a exigir un adecuado
retorno sobre la inversión en estudios superiores, rechazando cursos tontos
que no sirven para nada. Como siempre sucede en el libre mercado, el mal
servicio será rechazado y la gente votará con su dinero a favor de una
educación que prepara a la juventud para una vida productiva de ciudadanos
educados.

<h2>
FALSEDADES AMBIENTALES
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

S. Fred Singer
</a>

<P>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA (AIPE).- Cinco temas ambientales demuestran las
distorsiones y el mal uso de la ciencia en el diseño de políticas
gubernamentales, durante el último año:
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Recalentamiento de la Tierra: Durante 1995, cuentos de terror predecían
catástrofes por el "efecto invernadero", mientras que la evidencia sobre el
supuesto recalentamiento era cada vez más débil. En la primera Conferencia
del Tratado Climático Mundial, en abril del año pasado en Berlín,
descubrimientos científicos fueron ignorados, se procedió a establecer un
Secretariado Permanente y a preparar una megaconferencia. En septiembre, por
iniciativa del vicepresidente Al Gore, otra reunión en Washington promovió
un nuevo temor ligado al recalentamiento: la propagación de enfermedades
tropicales que afectarían a 3.000 millones de personas. En noviembre en
Madrid y en diciembre en Roma, el Panel Intergubernamental sobre Cambios
Climáticas, auspiciados por las Naciones Unidas, se las ingenió para aprobar
dos informes preliminares en borrador, ambos muy económicos con la verdad.
Presentaron los hechos en forma selectiva, mientras se abstuvieron de
incluir datos que indican cero recalentamiento.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Ante una burocracia desbocada a la que no le importa la evidencia
científica, Estados Unidos debe retirarse del Tratado antes de que las
Naciones Unidas nos lleven a la ruina económica.
<li>Ozono estratosférico y el cáncer de la piel: Desde el 31 de diciembre
está prohibida la fabricación de gases tipo freón y otras substancias
químicas bajo la errada creencia que es la manera de evitar una epidemia de
cáncer de la piel. La evidencia científica no existe y todo se basó en una
conferencia de prensa en 1992, donde se habló de un inminente "agujero de
ozono ártico" que nunca sucedió. No hay evidencia de que las radiaciones
ultravioletas que alcanzan la superficie terrestre estén incrementándose y
mediciones en laboratorios muestran que el melanoma mortal del cáncer de la
piel no es afectado por el nivel del ozono atmosférico.
<li>Humo de segunda mano: En noviembre el Servicio de Investigación del
Congreso encontró que no hay respaldo científico en la teoría que el humo de
fumadores causa cáncer entre los no fumadores, ya que hubo manipulación de
las cifras presentadas en las investigaciones de la Agencia de Protección
Ambiental (EPA).		
<li>La falsa alarma del gas radón: Antes de la Segunda Guerra, pequeñas
dosis radioactivas eran consideradas saludables. Los ricos disfrutaban de
baños termales con agua ligeramente radioactiva. Inclusive nuestros cuerpos
contienen radioactividad natural. Se sabe que dosis radioactivas por debajo
de cierto nivel no son dañinas. Sin embargo, la EPA insiste en que el radón
es "la principal amenaza ambiental contra la salud", causando que familias
gasten miles de dólares en detectar y erradicar el radón de sus casas.
<li>El ruinoso afán por "cero riesgo": La más costosa de todas las
regulaciones es la Cláusula Delaney de 1958 que impone el concepto de cero
riesgo. Cuando inmensas dosis de substancias como PCB, dioxín, ETS, alar,
etc. resultan fatales para ratones, se prohibe su inclusión en alimentos,
aunque el contenido sea ínfimo. Esto cobra significación cuando se toma en
cuenta que las regulaciones ambientales están costando $150.000 millones al
año, o sea $1.500 por cada familia estadounidense.

<h2>
SEGURO SOCIAL CONTRA LA FAMILIA
</h2>     
     
     
Robert A. Sirico*
<p>

GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Los votos que he tomado como sacerdote,
incluyendo el de pobreza y castidad, no son para todo el mundo. Otros tienen
la vocación de ser padres y madres, de proveer para su familia y sus
comunidades. Cuando el gobierno los despoja de su dinero, los está
desanimando de tener hijos y se les coarta artificialmente tal vocación.
<dd>	Sabemos que los gobiernos reducen la riqueza de la gente a través de
impuestos y de inflación. Gracias a programas como el del Seguro Social, los
hijos y las familias extensas han perdido su valor económico. Antes había un
contrato implícito de que los padres se ocuparían de sus hijos, quienes a su
vez se ocuparían de los padres cuando estos no pudieran seguirse ganando la
vida. Cada uno sería así protegido durante los años vulnerables. Hoy en día
a muchos padres les horroriza tener que depender de sus hijos y los hijos
-aun en tiempos malos- resienten tener que ocuparse de sus padres. Que lo
haga el gobierno.
<dd>	Mientras muchos jóvenes se lavan las manos en cuanto a la responsabilidad
que tienen con respecto a sus padres, también ponen en duda que van a
recibir un centavo en pensiones del Seguro Social. Y tienen razón. Para la
primera década del nuevo siglo, los impuestos a la nómina no serán
suficientes para cubrir los beneficios de los pensionados.
<dd>	Ha llegado el momento de dejar de hablar sólo de economía e introducir el
elemento moral al debate. Por falta de fuertes argumentos morales del lado
reformista, el intento de reformar la beneficencia pública fracasó el año
pasado. Una reforma económica radical necesita de respaldo moral. De otra
forma, la victoria siempre será de los demagogos.
<dd>	¿Hay argumentos morales contra el actual sistema de Seguridad Social? Claro
que sí. El Seguro Social fue originalmente establecido como una forma de
ahorro. El trabajador aportaba una parte de sus ingresos a cambio de
seguridad económica en la vejez. Esa es la promesa que el gobierno
cínicamente rompe. Y allí mismo está el poderoso argumento moral a favor de
la privatización del Seguro Social.
<dd>	Cuando el mercado aporta los servicios, la gente está en libertad de
participar o de retirarse del programa. Los administradores  de los fondos
tienen el incentivo de cumplir con sus obligaciones y con la palabra
empeñada. Los que no lo hacen, desaparecen. Pero no es así con el gobierno,
el cual se basa en un intercambio coercitivo, no voluntario. Desaparecen,
entonces, los incentivos para cumplir con lo ofrecido. Por eso es que el
gobierno utiliza los fondos del Seguro Social en gastos corrientes,
reemplazándolos con promesas de pago. Por eso es que se acusa al Seguro
Social de ser una pirámide fraudulenta.
<dd>	Los trabajadores no tienen manera de salirse aunque saben que se trata de
un fraude. La "promesa" ha dejado de parecerse a un contrato, convirtiéndose
en un sistema basado en el saqueo intergeneracional, con el botín
disminuyendo progresivamente a través del tiempo. Las nuevas generaciones no
sólo dejarán de percibir los intereses sino que ni siquiera recuperarán el
capital. Tampoco contarán con la ayuda de sus hijos cuando estén viejos. A
menos que hagamos algo se incrementarán las peleas y las recriminaciones
entre las generaciones
<dd>	Sin el Seguro Social, los jóvenes estarían nuevamente conscientes de su
obligación de pagar la deuda que tienen con sus padres. Cada uno planearía
su futuro, en lugar de depender de programas coercitivos del gobierno. Las
distintas generaciones comenzarían a redescubrir el valor de cada una de ellas.
<dd>	La moralidad del mercado es que los contratos son honestos y las promesas
se cumplen. Los gobiernos no están atados a tales valores morales.
Necesitamos de una seguridad social que le sea fiel a su nombre. &copy;

<TITLE>Smith: Sea Bueno, Produzca Utilidades -- 8/7/96</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>SEA BUENO, PRODUZCA UTILIDADES</H2>
Fred L. Smith*<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El fracaso del socialismo ha obligado a muchos de sus
partidarios a buscar nuevas maneras de alcanzar viejos objetivos. Ahora una
variante popular es la "responsabilidad social de la empresa". Los ex
socialistas ahora admiten que el capitalismo juega un papel importante, pero
ese papel debe ser limitado porque omite valores importantes, tales como la
"equidad" en el trabajo, las ramificaciones ecológicas de actividades
empresariales, el impacto sobre los niños y las minorías, las virtudes de un
trabajo seguro, etc. Alegan que si juntamos la eficiencia capitalista con la
justicia social, el mundo sería mejor. ¿Es eso verdad?
<dd>	
Es cierto que el capitalismo tiene sus problemas, aquellos que el
economista Schumpeter llamó "elementos destructivos creativos". Cuando una
gran empresa quiebra, causa el caos entre miles de vidas. Si un producto
está mal diseñado o se utiliza de manera no anticipada el resultado puede
ser desastroso. Una industria puede manejar mal sus residuos y desechos,
tirándolos a un río o al aire que respiran sus vecinos. A menudo la frialdad
impersonal del mercado amenaza los cálidos valores de una sociedad tradicional.
<dd>	
¿No sería maravilloso si los ciudadanos-trabajadores, motivados por una
cívica filantropía y laborando en empresas conscientes de sus
responsabilidades sociales se unieran todos para eliminar la pobreza, el
racismo, la contaminación y demás prejuicios e iniquidades del mundo? 
<dd>	
Cuidado. El resultado podría ser mucho peor que la realidad de hoy. El
movimiento en pro de la "responsabilidad empresarial" no comprende los retos
de la sociedad moderna: la necesidad de la especialización y de
interacciones anónimas. El altruismo es un atributo demasiado raro para ser
la base de una sociedad moderna porque no hay suficiente cantidad de Madres
Teresas para lograrlo. Como lo expresó Adam Smith, una larga vida apenas
genera un reducido grupo de amigos íntimos, pero todos los días tratamos
pacíficamente, a través del mercado, con un inmenso mundo compuesto de
extraños. El comunitarismo no es suficiente para organizar a una sociedad
moderna. Confiar en los más diversos intereses personales para organizar
tales relaciones no es el resultado de la maldad sino, más bien, de la
necesidad.
<dd>	
Una empresa junto con sus accionistas debe ocuparse de su "familia"
corporativa inmediata: sus empleados y vecinos, sus suplidores y sus
clientes. Esos grupos tienen un interés en la prosperidad a largo plazo de
la firma. Extender esa relación al resto del mundo es permitir que se
entrometa gente que no tiene ninguna razón para averiguar el valor de la
empresa ni importarle su supervivencia. La sociedad moderna es posible
porque la mayoría de la gente está excluida de la mayoría de las
actividades. Las instituciones del mercado -propiedad privada, contratos, la
compañía anónima- son dispositivos de exclusión. Estos crean esferas
circunscritas de responsabilidad y poder, en las cuales cada uno de nosotros
juega papeles especializados para mutuo beneficio.
<dd>	
Una empresa no se funda para resolver los problemas del mundo. Su formato
distingue a un grupo de personas como accionistas -los que aportan capital-
de todas los demás. La empresa contrata gerentes para administrar el capital
en beneficio de los accionistas. Inclusive, el interés de los accionistas
tiende a limitarse a si la empresa es lucrativa o no; a si su dinero estaría
mejor invertido en otra parte. No tomar eso en cuenta y pretender que "su
empresa" es "mi empresa" nos conduce al colectivismo, lo cual socava las
bases de la sociedad moderna y amenaza con devolvernos a un pasado tribal. ©

<title>Stelzer: Guerra Contra Fabricas LatinoAmericans -- 8/7/96</title>

<h2>GUERRA CONTRA FABRICAS LATINOAMERICANAS</h2><br>
Irwin Stelzer*
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columinsits/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Los altos ejecutivos estadounidenses están descontentos.
Primero fueron el blanco de críticas por sus altos salarios, enfrentan
incertidumbre en la Bolsa de Valores y, además, están siendo acusados de
explotar a mujeres y niños en los países en desarrollo.<dd>
	Las empresas estadounidenses dependen de contratistas y subcontratistas
extranjeros que manufacturan de todo, desde franelas para Gap hasta zapatos
Nike. Esto fue llevado a la atención del público cuando denunciantes
revelaron que la ropa vendida con el nombre de una conocida presentadora de
televisión estaba siendo producida tanto en Honduras como en la ciudad de
Nueva York bajo malas condiciones de trabajo.<dd>
	En el escándalo que siguió, Kathie Lee Gifford, la presentadora de
televisión, casada con un conocido atleta, pidió perdón con lágrimas en los
ojos ante una Comisión del Congreso, mientras su marido distribuía billetes
entre los oprimidos trabajadores en Nueva York y todo ello era filmado por
las cámaras de televisión.<dd>
	Simultáneamente, Michael Jordan, la estrella del baloncesto firmaba un
contrato por $25 millones, una cantidad que fácilmente doblará con su
patrocinio de Nike. Los denunciantes lo acusaron, entonces, de ganancias
inmorales, mientras los trabajadores que manufacturan los Nike ganan unos
pocos dólares al día.<dd>
	Peor todavía, algunas de las fábricas que producen marcas americanas
mantienen condiciones indeseables, por lo menos según el estándar de este
país, acostumbrado al aire acondicionado en las factorías. Así que además de
acusaciones de trasladar la manufactura de sus productos a otros países y
despedir empleados estadounidenses, a los ejecutivos ahora se les acusa de
explotar a niños del Tercer Mundo para aumentar sus ya groseras ganancias.<dd>
	Las acusaciones provienen no sólo de reformistas bien intencionados sino de
sindicatos empeñados en reducirle la competencia al obrero estadounidense.
Se trata de una guerra de los sindicatos en contra de la globalización de la
economía.<dd>
	Lamentablemente, los argumentos sobre la responsabilidad de las empresas
norteamericanas hacia los trabajadores extranjeros están dominados por
emociones más que razones. Una activista me informó haber logrado convencer
a una cadena de tiendas a dejar de utilizar muchachas para elaborar la ropa
que venden. Cuando le pregunté qué estaban haciendo ahora esas jóvenes
salvadoreñas desempleadas, me contestó que asumía habrían regresado a la
escuela. Es mucho más probable que estén ahora trabajando por salarios más
bajos y en peores condiciones.<dd>
	Es cierto que Nike se ha convertido en un gigante, pero que esté obligado a
hacer más que obedecer la ley de los países donde opera es una propuesta
dudosa. No es probable que los trabajadores de las naciones en desarrollo
estarían mejor si Estados Unidos restringe la fabricación en el extranjero.
Un ejecutivo me cuenta que él paga $25 mensuales a trabajadores chinos,
quienes se han convertido en los ricos del pueblo. En Honduras, los
trabajadores que cosen pantalones Levi's ganan $5,40 al día, el doble del
salario mínimo.<dd>
	Los que se la dan de protectores de los trabajadores mexicanos y
centroamericanos están tratando de acabar con puestos de trabajo que ofrecen
oportunidades escasas en esos países, sin aumentar los precios que los
consumidores pagan por tales productos. ©<p>

<TITLE>COSTA RICA:  ESTAFA LEGALIZADA -- 10/09/96</TITLE>

<H2>COSTA RICA: ESTAFA LEGALIZADA</H2>
Rigoberto Stewart*<br>
<p>
SAN JOSE DE COSTA RICA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
La deuda pública se ha convertido
mundialmente en un grave problema que amenaza destruir economías y los
sistemas democráticos. Sin embargo, pocos países encaran con seriedad el
problema y Costa Rica no es uno de ellos. 
<P>El problema es que los gobiernos gastan mucho más de lo que recaudan y
prefieren financiar el déficit con créditos y con emisiones monetarias, que
es un impuesto indirecto. Así, cada administración deja en herencia a la
siguiente una deuda mayor. Por tal razón, la deuda pública costarricense
crece como una bola de nieve.
<P>Entre 1993 y 1996, la deuda interna en Costa Rica se triplicó. En
1996 crece 26% sobre 1995 y en 1997 aumentará 27%. A finales de 1995, la
deuda pública total -interna, externa y no documentada a algunas
instituciones públicas, como el Seguro Social- era de $6.943 millones,
equivalente a 77% del PIB. Y en 1997 se espera que llegue a US$7.937. La
deuda total por habitante crece más rápido que la producción económica
(PIB). Esto indica que el país no se está endeudando para realizar
inversiones productivas, y que pronto un sector grande de la población
trabajará sólo para pagar la deuda.
<P>¿Es sostenible tal situación? El ministro de Hacienda dice que no hay
parámetros internacionales que indiquen el nivel óptimo de la deuda pública.
No obstante, el PIB es un buen indicador de la capacidad de pago. Los
estadounidenses han estado alarmados porque su deuda pública ha oscilado
entre 24% y 42% del PIB desde 1933, y porque el pago de intereses ha
representado entre 7% y 14% del presupuesto fiscal, y entre 1,5% y 3% del
PIB. En Costa Rica, la deuda alcanzará 86% del PIB en 1997, mientras que el
pago de intereses ya representa un tercio del gasto público anual y más del
5% del PIB. Además de alarmante, esta situación es totalmente insostenible.
Pero las autoridades, que siguen gastando a manos llenas, apenas dan
muestras de preocupación.
<P>Aparte de otros daños, la deuda pública frena el desarrollo. Al recurrir a
los mercados financieros en busca de recursos, el gobierno impide que muchas
empresas obtengan financiamiento, a la vez que hace subir las tasas de
interés. Esto conduce a menos inversión, menos producción, menos empleo
productivo y menos creación de riqueza. Y al tomar dinero de instituciones
públicas, como  la  Caja de Seguro Social y de telecomunicaciones, deja a la
ciudadanía con menos servicios públicos.
<P>En América Latina, los gobernantes suelen ejercer el poder
endeudando a la población sin ningún límite, y cuatro años después se van,
sin responder por sus actos. Además, casi todo el crédito público va a
gastos, no a inversión, lo que implica que los gobernantes se están comiendo
hoy la producción de generaciones futuras. Algo realmente inmoral.  
<P>En Costa Rica, además, la deuda pública ha sido un instrumento de estafa.
El 58% de la deuda interna es contraída con instituciones del Estado, o sea,
el Estado se endeuda consigo mismo; pero le cobra la factura a los
contribuyentes. En realidad, esta deuda también representa impuestos futuros
dilapidados hoy. Por otra parte, 42% de la deuda es con el sector privado.
En este caso, el Estado le pide prestado a los ricos para concederles
privilegios, pero recurre a los pobres para cancelar la deuda. Este esquema
es un mecanismo de transferencia de pobres a ricos. Una estafa legalizada.
<P>Hoy sabemos que no hay ningún servicio que no pueda ser
brindado por una entidad diferente al Estado. De ahí que, los libertarios
costarricenses han propuesto las siguientes tres acciones, para solucionar
definitivamente el problema de la deuda: Primero, vender los activos del
Estado y, con el dinero, cancelar la deuda. Para lograr el mayor precio
posible, los activos serían vendidos mediante subastas abiertas a todo el
mundo. Se ha estimado que la venta del Instituto Costarricense de
Electricidad (electricidad y telecomunicaciones) podría generar unos $1.500
millones, la mitad de la deuda externa. Segundo, retirar al Estado de todas
las actividades que no le competen. Tercero, prohibir, por medio de la
Constitución, el endeudamiento futuro del Estado. Esto último es esencial
para que la solución del problema sea permanente. ©

<h2>
SOCIALISMO VENEZOLANO SOCORRIDO POR EL FMI
</h2>     
     
     
Alejandro J. Sucre
<p>

CARACAS <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Con la ceremonia de la firma del préstamo de $1.400
millones, el Fondo Monetario Internacional está oficialmente de vuelta en
Venezuela desde el 3 de junio. El director gerente del FMI, Michael
Camdessus, nos recordó -lleno de orgullo- que a raíz del anterior acuerdo en
1989 el gasto social y la inversión gubernamental aumentaron. Los políticos
venezolanos respiran ahora aliviados por el auxilio del FMI y los
inversionistas extranjeros están alertas a oportunidades de negocios.
Irónicamente, el venezolano común fue quien salió perdiendo.
Se han dado algunos pasos positivos. En enero, el gobierno venezolano
reabrió el sector petrolero a inversionistas extranjeros. El nombramiento de
Teodoro Petkoff -un ex guerrillero comunista- como ministro de Planificación
ha sido bien recibido por su nueva retórica pro mercado.  El gobierno aceptó
las condiciones del FMI sobre la eliminación del control de precios y de
cambios, terminando también con el inmenso subsidio al precio de la gasolina.
Pero tales medidas en realidad significan muy poco. El FMI nos impuso sus
típicas medidas de austeridad e incremento de impuestos.  Peor todavía, el
préstamo del FMI sólo sirve para  financiar la crisis de balanza de pagos,
la cual debió haber sido resuelta a través de los mecanismos de mercado. Y
la apertura petrolera a inversionistas extranjeros lejos de significar la
privatización de la industria petrolera la aleja porque las utilidades
compartidas y los ingresos impositivos del nuevo esquema de explotación irán
directamente a engrosar el estado. Esos nuevos ingresos lejos de ser
herramientas de desarrollo serán el nuevo sustento de las corruptas
instituciones políticas.  
<dd>Venezuela sigue dándole la espalda a la solución a sus problemas: el
traspaso a manos privadas de los inmensos activos que el estado derrocha.
Por este camino seguimos avanzando hacia la desintegración económica,
mientras que los nuevos recursos petroleros y el acuerdo con el FMI
facilitan y financian esa fatal trayectoria.
<dd>Durante los últimos 20 años, el estamento político venezolano ha acumulado
control sobre los activos del país a una velocidad vertiginosa. Se estima
que 70% de los activos productivos pertenecen al estado, contra 25% en 1970.
Las propiedades del estado incluyen todas las minas, el petróleo, fábricas
petroquímicas, las industrias de aluminio y acero, playas, puertos, gran
parte de las tierras agrícolas, inmuebles, hoteles, 60% del sistema
bancario, compañías manufactureras, estaciones de radio y televisión, etc. Y
todas esas empresas estatales, a excepción de las petroleras, pierden dinero
a manos llenas. Sin el esquema de apertura petrolera y el financiamiento del
FMI, el estado venezolano se vería obligado a privatizar.
<dd>A pesar de los inmensos ingresos petroleros (más de $350.000 millones desde
1976), estos ya resultan insuficientes para los políticos, drenando su poder
de comprar elecciones. Según las últimas encuestas, ningún político ni
partido goza de más del 8% de las preferencias del electorado. Pero el
retroceso logrado ha sido dantesco. 
<dd>Desde 1976, el PIB per capita del venezolano ha caído en 39% y la inflación
se ha multiplicado 110 veces. Hoy el déficit fiscal equivale al 16% del PIB;
el servicio de la deuda externa absorbe 25% de las exportaciones; la deuda
es de $35.000 millones; el desempleo de 20% y  51% de  la población activa
trabaja en el sector informal de la economía. La clase media se ha contraído
de 25% a apenas 18% de la población.  
<p>
En lugar de correr la arruga endeudándonos más, aumentando impuestos y
tarifas de servicios públicos, el gobierno debió superar la crisis
instrumentando las reformas necesarias: 
<ul>
<li>  Privatización del 20% de la industria petrolera para pagar toda la deuda
externa.
<li>  Liquidación de $2.000 millones de activos bancarios asumidos por el
estado a raíz de la crisis del sector financiero de 1994, para reducir la
deuda pública interna y el costo de intereses.
<li>  Reducir el gasto público a través de un programa de capitalización que
coloque en manos de los ciudadanos todos los activos del estado socialista,
incluyendo escuelas públicas, hospitales y el 80% remanente de PDVSA.  Sólo
devolviendo a la ciudadanía la propiedad de los activos productivos de la
nación se cambia el rumbo económico. Los subsidios a la gasolina, los
impuestos ni las tarifas de los servicios públicos se han debido alterar
antes de traspasarle a la ciudadanía los recursos productivos del país.
El FMI ha tenido un papel vergonzoso en toda esta comedia de errores.
Financiar el déficit fiscal con nuevo endeudamiento y elevando impuestos se
sacrifica y se empobrece más al pueblo. Luego del alboroto propagandístico
de las últimas semanas, la Venezuela de hoy sigue siendo la misma de ayer.
La economía sigue en manos de políticos y burócratas ineptos y corruptos,
mientras que los burócratas del FMI parecen creer que el capitalismo sólo
funciona en las naciones del G-7y hay que evitar su contagio al mundo en
desarrollo.
</ul>
<dd>	Ningún plan del FMI ni pacto estatista con las grandes corporaciones
petroleras detendrá la devaluación, la inflación y el progresivo
empobrecimiento, a menos que el ciudadano común tenga los incentivos
necesarios para convertirse en verdadero motor de la economía. Por ahora,
los venezolanos estamos forzados a aceptar la Agenda Caldera-FMI: aumento de
impuestos y de los servicios públicos y seremos testigos de cómo esos fondos
son despilfarrados. &copy;

HAITI, EL GRAN ENGAÑO

<h2>
Haiti, El Gran Engaño*
</h2>
John Sweeney*
<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Hace dos años regresó a Haití Jean Bertrand Aristide
bajo la protección de 20.000 soldados estadounidenses enviados por el
presidente Clinton para restaurar la democracia en un país que nunca la ha
experimentado. La administración Clinton alega que su intervención militar
en Haití ha sido uno de los mayores éxitos de la política exterior en la
historia americana. La realidad es que no se diferencia mucho de las demás
aventuras extranjeras de Clinton: Bosnia, Irlanda del Norte, Corea del Norte
y el Medio Oriente.
<p>
Los contribuyentes estadounidenses han desembolsillado más de $2.000
millones para financiar la intervención en Haití y todavía ninguno de los
propósitos de la "Operación Rescate de la Democracia" ha sido alcanzado. No
se ha establecido una firme y duradera democracia. Continúan los asesinatos
políticos. Siguen las presiones económicas y políticas para que la gente
emigre a Estados Unidos. 70% de la población no sabe leer y 60% está
desempleada. Escuadrones armados están surgiendo en el interior de la isla.
<p>
La elección presidencial del 17 de diciembre de 1995 resultó ser ni justa
ni libre, según el Centro Carter y la presidencia de René Preval consolida a
Aristide como gobernante absoluto, ya que Preval hará el papel de títere por
cinco años hasta que Aristide pueda volver a ser candidato en el año 2000.
Gracias al apoyo de Clinton, Aristide es el líder político más temido y
poderoso de Haití desde tiempos de 'Papá Doc' Duvalier. Desde su regreso,
Aristide también se ha hecho millonario. Los tímidos intentos privatizadores
de Preval han sido bloqueados por Aristide y nada se ha adelantado en abrir
una economía que sigue estancada.
<p>
Bejamin Gilman, presidente del Comité de Relaciones Internacionales de la
Cámara de Representantes del Congreso de Estados Unidos afirma que la
administración Clinton "sabe desde principios de 1995 que escuadrones de la
muerte operan bajo la dirección de los jefes de seguridad del presidente
Aristide". El embajador de Estados Unidos en la isla, William Swing, informó
sobre el primero de estos asesinatos en un cable al Departamento de Estado
el 18 de febrero de 1995. Luego, en septiembre de 1995, Swing informó que el
gobierno de Aristide había obstaculizado las investigaciones del FBI de
estos mismos asesinatos políticos. Unos 24 líderes democráticos, opositores
de Aristide, fueron asesinados en 1995, mientras muchos soldados americanos
permanecían en la isla. Todos los asesinatos fueron relacionados
directamente a los jefes de seguridad del Palacio Presidencial y Aristide
rechazó las peticiones privadas del embajador Swing y del subsecretario de
Estado Strobe Talbott para que destituyera a los culpables.
<p>
Esa misma guardia palaciega, entrenada en Virginia a un costo para los
contribuyentes estadounidenses de $5,5 millones, sigue cuidando a Preval y
exterminando a la oposición durante 1996. El 13 de septiembre de este año,
el gobierno de Estados Unidos envió urgentemente a 46 agentes del
Departamento de Estado y del Pentágono a Puerto Príncipe al enterarse de
rumores de golpe contra Preval. Entonces fue cuando Preval destituyó al jefe
de la guardia de seguridad presidencial y a su asistente, tras una reunión
secreta con Talbott, Swing y Anthony Lake, asesor de Seguridad Nacional del
presidente Clinton.
<p>
El gobierno de Clinton está engañando al Congreso y al público con respecto
a Haití. La complicidad de la administración en la política interna haitiana
es tan sucia que el presidente Clinton se ha visto obligado a invocar
razones de estado para tapar el total fracaso de la Operación Rescate de la
Democracia. Aristide, un cura antiamericano que ahorcó los hábitos y
públicamente daba el visto bueno a los asesinatos de sus opositores, antes
de ser tumbado en 1991, tiene a la Casa Blanca agarrada por el pescuezo.
Clinton puede mantener el mito de una frágil paz en Haití mientras Aristide
se lo permita. Haití sigue siendo un polvorín que estallará poco después de
la retirada de las últimas tropas de Estados Unidos y de las Naciones Unidas. ©

Carlota Wigglesworth*<br>
<p>

LONDRES  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Un creciente número de mujeres latinoamericanas está siendo
atrapado en el terrible mundo de la pobreza y el vicio, al dedicarse al
sórdido transporte de drogas. <p>
Tengo tiempo  trabajando  con mujeres  latinoamericanas en cárceles de Gran
Bretaña, detenidas casi todas en los aeropuertos de Heathrow y Gatwick por
transportar drogas, principalmente cocaína. En los últimos meses he notado
un cambio radical y preocupante en la mecánica de esa importación. Venezuela
se perfila como el puerto de salida de la droga proveniente de Colombia,
Perú y Bolivia con destino a Europa. Por años, en el grupo de 94 latinas
encarceladas en Inglaterra, había una sola venezolana y la mayoría eran
colombianas. Este año, el número de venezolanas ha aumentado
considerablemente y aunque las detenciones son de nacionalidades variadas,
todas procedían de Venezuela. La edad promedio es de 22 años; casi todas son
madres solteras, sin medios para mantener a sus hijos.  Sin ningún tipo de
recursos ni de apoyo familiar, terminan siendo reclutadas por los
narcotraficantes, quienes se concentran en los sectores pobres. En
Venezuela, 84% de la población vive hoy en la pobreza y madres desesperadas
son especialmente vulnerables a las promesas de los narcotraficantes. <p>
	El reclutamiento de las llamadas "mulas" funciona de la siguiente manera.
Los agentes identifican a mujeres con deudas y desespero por cubrir las
necesidades básicas de su familia. Le ofrecen "amistad" y ayuda material.
Cuando la mujer se enreda, la obligan a pagar la deuda trabajando en el
transporte de paquetes con droga. Si la desdichada trata de salirse del
compromiso, la amenazan con maltratar y hasta matar a sus hijos y demás
familiares. Una vez que la mujer está atrapada, la obligan a tragar
cápsulas, burdamente preparadas, rellenando condones o dedos de guantes
quirúrgicos con cocaína. Algunas han tragado hasta 100 cápsulas o las
"embalsaman"; esto es, sujetan pequeñas bolsas de cocaína al cuerpo con
vendajes. Así las montan, generalmente por primera vez, en aviones. Otras
traen droga en tacones falsos, en el forro de la ropa, en maletines y bolsos
de mano, en cosméticos y hasta en alimentos.<p>
	Las autoridades británicas están muy bien equipadas para detectar
contrabando de drogas y los inspectores de aduana son muy competentes. Aquí
la ley es muy severa respecto al narcotráfico.<p>
En los aeropuertos de Londres presencio continuamente duras interrogaciones
a través de intérpretes. Las someten a exámenes de rayos X y las detienen en
celdas hasta que la droga ingerida sea evacuada. La droga se pesa y se
analiza para establecer su pureza y cantidad, de lo cual dependerá la
ulterior sentencia.<p>
	Del aeropuerto estas mujeres son trasladadas a la prisión de Holloway,
donde permanecen hasta ser sentenciadas, unos seis meses más tarde. Luego,
las transfieren a prisiones en el interior del país, donde cumplen condenas
de 7, 9 o 12 años. Sin saber el idioma ni conocer el sistema legal o las
regulaciones de la cárcel, estas mujeres ingresan a un infierno, donde el
peor castigo es no saber de sus hijos y familiares.<p>
	Tenemos varios casos de mujeres que dejaron hijos pequeños a cargo de una
amiga cuando salieron de viaje "por una semana", bajo promesas de $200 a
$600 por transportar cocaína con un valor en la calle de 30 a 45 mil
dólares. Los niños, quienes pronto dejan de estar a cargo de la amiga,
generalmente tan pobre como la "mula", seguidamente ingresan al implacable
círculo de la pobreza-vicio-droga-crimen.<p>
	La mujer una vez reclutada no tiene escape. Si cumple con éxito su primera
misión, vuelven a usarla; si la detienen, la familia es víctima de
represalias. Visito a tres  mujeres que les  mataron los hijos. Una
colombiana recibió en la cárcel la noticia del asesinato de su hijo de 16
años, a quien durmiendo en casa de la abuela lo ejecutaron de un tiro en la
sien. A otra colombiana le mataron la hija saliendo de una tienda en Cali y
a un tercer niño lo arrolló y mató un automóvil, mientras que al hermano de
otra detenida lo asesinaron a palos. Vi los certificados de defunción… tengo
las pruebas.<p>
	Una española, detenida al llegar de Venezuela, cuenta que para drogarse se
endeudó con el cartel y fue reclutada, "una vez que entras en ese circulo
-me dijo- no te puedes salir aunque lo desees y trates... después de uno de
mis intentos de escapar, mataron a mi hermano en represalia".  <p>
	No quiero sólo ayudar en lo que puedo a estas desdichadas mujeres, sino
también dar a conocer este horrible drama para evitar que otras muchachas
caigan en la misma tentación, creyendo que los narcotraficantes les van a
resolver sus problemas. Sólo lograrán destruir sus vidas y exponer a seres
queridos a la tortura y el asesinato. ©<p>

<h2>
POBRES PERO NO TONTOS
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Walter Williams
</a>

<P>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA (AIPE).- Entre 1965 y 1994, los programas gubernamentales
para eliminar la pobreza le costaron al contribuyente estadounidense
$5.400.000.000.000. Con esa cantidad se pueden comprar todas las fábricas,
toda la maquinaria industrial y todos los edificios de oficinas de este
país. Con el dinero que queda, se pueden comprar todas las líneas aéreas, de
transporte terrestre y marítimo. Y si todavía tiene ganas de seguir de
compras, podría adquirir todas las estaciones de televisión, de radio y
plantas de energía eléctrica, además de todas las tiendas al detal y todas
las empresas mayoristas. Y todavía quedarían suficientes fondos como para
comprar todo el sector agrícola, maderero y pesquero de la nación. La
tragedia es que durante los próximos cinco años se proyectan gastar
$2.800.000.000.000 en estos mismos programas.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
¿Acaso los pobres reciben todo ese inmenso caudal de dinero? En 1993
habían 40 millones de pobres en Estados Unidos y se gastaron $324.000
millones en programas para combatir la pobreza, lo cual equivale a darle
$8.100 a cada persona pobre o $34.400 a cada familia pobre. Lo que en
realidad sucede es que el grueso de ese dinero no le llega a los pobres sino
que queda en manos de los parásitos que forman parte de la "industria de la
pobreza".
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Además, la forma en que estos programas están diseñados simplemente le
impiden a la gente con ganas de ganarse la vida salir del círculo vicioso
impuesto por el gobierno. Por ejemplo, en el estado de Oregon, el "paquete"
de ayuda gubernamental que recibe una madre soltera con dos niños es de
$16.959 al año. Para que le quede esa cantidad neta, después de pagar
impuestos, esa misma mujer tendría que percibir un sueldo anual de $19,000,
o sea $9,23 por hora. En Hawai el "paquete" de ayuda social para esa madre
es $27.736, lo cual quiere decir que para mantener su nivel de ingresos
trabajando tendría que ganar $17,50 por hora. El monto de salario por hora
equivalente a los beneficios percibidos por una madre soltera con dos niños
es de $14,75 en la ciudad de Nueva York, $12,45 en Filadelfia, $11,35 en
Baltimore y $10,90 en Detroit.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Muchos de los beneficiarios de la ayuda social no tienen el entrenamiento
ecesario para ganar tales salarios. Son pobres, pero no son tan tontos como
para dejar de percibir beneficios que equivalen a $12 o $14 por hora para
esforzarse en conseguir un trabajo que les pague $5 o $6 por hora, además de
tener que levantarse temprano, cumplir con la disciplina de un trabajo,
pasarse ocho horas diarias recibiendo órdenes de sus supervisores y gastar
en transporte, ropa adecuada, etc. Las encuestas muestran que el 70% de los
beneficiarios de ayuda social gubernamental no buscan empleo. En el largo
plazo, esto tiene devastadoras consecuencias para el país.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Para mantener el Estado Beneficencia, el Congreso le saca del bolsillo a
cada familia estadounidense que paga impuestos un promedio de $3.400 al año.
Se trata de un nuevo tipo de esclavitud. El término es apropiado porque
significa que se está obligando físicamente a alguien a hacer algo contra su
voluntad, en beneficio de otro. Como descendiente de esclavos, eso es algo
que comprendo bien y que me convierte en abolicionista.

<h2>
MODERNISMO DESCONCERTANTE
</h2>

Walter Williams*
<p>

FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Tener 60 años significa pertenecer a otra
generación y tener problemas ajustándose a la vida moderna. No vivimos en
una época donde el sentido común y la responsabilidad personal se dan por
sentado.
<dd>	Hace unas semanas mi esposa me compró un mueble de madera sin pulir para mi
oficina, con la esperanza de que se viera más ordenada. Como persona
razonable procedí a leer las instrucciones en la lata del tinte para la
madera, antes de comenzar a aplicarlo. La etiqueta tiene la siguiente
advertencia: "No se ingiera". Y me pregunté, ¿hay gente capaz de agarrar una
lata de tintura para madera y empinársela? Alguien suficientemente estúpido
para hacer eso seguramente no sabe leer. ¿Por qué , entonces, tal
advertencia? Me imagino que los abogados de la firma fabricante temen que
alguien se tome el contenido y demande a la empresa, consiguiendo varios
millones con la decisión de un juez que la culpe por la estupidez del
demandante.
<dd>	También está el asunto de la juventud estadounidense. Me he pasado la vida
adorando a los niños, no a todos, pero sí a la mayoría. Ahora los niños se
han convertido en mis enemigos. Los niños permiten ser utilizados como
herramientas de un gobierno entrometido. Apenas alguien habla de dar menos
dinero del gobierno para los almuerzos escolares, alguien se monta con un
niño en el escenario y grita, "¡pretenden matar de hambre a este niño
inocente!" Cuando se hacen esfuerzos por reformar la beneficencia pública
haciendo trabajar a quienes sean físicamente capaces de hacerlo, lo primero
que oímos son gritos contra "los hambreadores de niños y madres indefensas".
Cuando los tiranos en el Congreso quieren restringir por la fuerza lo que
podemos ver en la televisión y en el Internet o prohibir a adultos que fumen
si les da la gana, de nuevo son los niños los que usan como instrumentos.
<dd>	Si los niños quieren recobrar mi cariño y mi fe en ellos tienen que dejar
de ser utilizados como armas por tales granujas. Los niños deben convocar
una rueda de prensa y decirle a la nación que si alguien quiere saber lo que
ellos piensan tienen que preguntárselo a ellos y no a quienes se han
autodenominado sus representantes y defensores.
<dd>	Otro problema de desajuste a mi edad es que no sé tratar a las damas como
si fueran hombres. Cuando viajo en transporte público, suelo ofrecer mi
asiento a una señora, si no hay otro puesto disponible. Cuando camino por la
acera con una dama, tomo instintivamente el lado de la calle y le abro las
puertas que encontremos. Algunas lo ven como caballerosidad, mientras que
ahora otras se ofenden, sintiendo que trato de insultarlas. ¿Cómo distinguir
de antemano a las damas de las mujeres?
<dd>	Además está el asunto de las razas. Los expertos ahora dicen que la
patología de la vida de muchos negros es el resultado de un legado de
esclavitud, segregación y racismo. Por eso muchos jóvenes negros no saben
leer ni escribir, prolifera entre ellos el delito y menos del 40% crecen en
un hogar con padre y madre. 
<dd>	Pero en 1950, cuando yo estudiaba en la escuela pública Benjamin Franklin
del norte de Filadelfia, no sabíamos de ningún niño que no supiera leer y
escribir. A partir de 1870, la mayoría de los niños negros vivían en hogares
con su papá y su mamá. Los barrios negros, incluyendo el vecindario de
viviendas gubernamentales donde yo vivía, eran suficientemente seguros como
para dormir con todas las puertas y ventanas abiertas durante los meses
calurosos del verano. ¿Cómo engrana eso con lo que dicen ahora los expertos
raciales en cuanto a que la esclavitud y el racismo son las causas de los
problemas actuales? La única explicación es que los efectos de la esclavitud
y el racismo saltan generaciones enteras, afectando a la de hoy, pero no a
la de ayer. Nada de eso suena muy lógico, ¿no es verdad?&copy

<TITLE> Williams: LAS REDUCCIONES DE PERSONAL -- 9/04/96</TITLE>

<H2>LAS REDUCCIONES DE PERSONAL</H2>
Walter Williams*<br>
<p>



FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Una de las estrategias utilizadas por los que
quieren controlarnos la vida es inventar una crisis. Las reducciones de
personal por parte de las grandes empresas, que a menudo se denuncian en la
prensa, es un ejemplo de esa estrategia.<p>
	Pongamos tales reducciones en su perspectiva correcta, preguntando si ello
resulta favorable para el país o si el gobierno debiera intervenir para
evitarlo.<p>
	Cuando nació este país, 95% de la población tenía de alguna manera que ver
con la agricultura. Hoy apenas 2% labran la tierra. Tremenda reducción de
personal, pero ¿ha resultado malo para la nación? ¿Ha debido el Congreso, en
el pasado, tomar cartas en el asunto para evitar la pérdida de puestos en el
campo?<p>
	Años atrás, la construcción pesada, de ferrocarriles, carreteras, represas,
puentes y túneles requería cuadrillas de hombres con palas y picos. Hoy,
unos pocos y muy bien pagados operadores manejan inmensos y sofisticados
equipos, apretando botones y moviendo palancas, logrando hacer en un día lo
que cientos no lograban hacer antes. La tecnificación de la construcción
destruyó miles de puestos de trabajo. ¿Qué ha debido hacer el gobierno para
evitarlo?<p>
	Son inevitables las reducciones de personal cuando las empresas encuentran
métodos más baratos de producción. La mano de obra tiende a ser el elemento
más costoso, por lo que hay incentivos económicos para automatizar. Cuando
se utiliza menos personal, el personal sobrante encuentra ocupación en otra
área de la economía. Si no se hubieran logrado formas de ahorrar mano de
obra en la agricultura, ¿de dónde hubiesen salido los trabajadores
necesarios para producir todos los demás bienes y servicios que han
contribuido a nuestra riqueza? Si el 95% estuviera todavía ocupado en
producir alimentos, no habría tiempo para obtener la educación y el
entrenamiento necesario para aumentar la productividad.<p>
	El año pasado Wal-Mart contrató 41.000 nuevos empleados, Motorola 5.000,
Intel casi 10.000. De hecho se crearon 9,5 millones nuevos puestos en los
último cuatro años. Si IBM y AT&T no hubieran encontrado la manera de
utilizar menos personal, en dónde hubieran las otras compañías conseguido
los empleados? La alternativa hubiera sido que se dispararan los sueldos y,
por consiguiente, los precios.<p>
	En una economía robusta, dinámica y en crecimiento, siempre habrá
alteraciones en el uso de la mano de obra. Unos puestos desaparecen y otros
se crean. La intervención del gobierno en este proceso sólo empobrece a la
nación. Seríamos más pobres si se hubiese mantenido por decreto al cochero y
al vendedor de hielo.<p>
	Nada de esto niega que las reducciones de personal causan penuria,
especialmente entre los padres de familia que tienen que pagar la hipoteca
de su casa y vestir a los hijos. Muchos tienen que aprender otros oficios o
aceptar sueldos más bajos. Pero una economía sana y robusta facilita esa
transición, mientras que todo lo contrario sucede en economías con leyes que
"protegen" el empleo con toda clase de regulaciones.<p>
	En cualquier momento, la inmensa mayoría está empleada. ¿Debemos aceptar
que se debilite la economía, extinguiendo toda innovación y progreso en
beneficio de un relativamente pequeño número de trabajadores que pierden su
empleo como resultado de adelantos tecnológicos, cambios del mercado y
reestructuraciones de las empresas? Pienso que no. © <p>

<H2>LA FALACIA DE LA VENTANA ROTA</H2>
Walter Williams*<br>
<p>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
Con cada leída de "Economía en una lección",
escrito por el ya fallecido Henry Hazlitt, quedo más impresionado por la
manera clara que este economista y periodista entendía los fundamentos de la
economía y con la agudeza de su ingenio.
<P>En el cuento de Hazlitt sobre la ventana rota, unos maleantes tiran una
piedra y rompen la ventana de una panadería. El panadero sale enfurecido,
pero alguien le dice que lo sucedido tiene su lado bueno. Los $250 que
cuesta reemplazar la vidriera le dará trabajo al cortador de vidrios.
Después de todo, si las ventanas nunca se rompieran, ¿qué sucedería con el
negocio de los vidrios? Al panadero también le recuerdan el efecto
multiplicador. El vidriero tendrá $250 para gastar en otros comercios y
estos comerciantes gastarán a la vez ese dinero, continuando la cadena. Uno
podría entonces concluir que los maleantes lejos de ser una amenaza pública
son benefactores de la sociedad.
<P>Hazlitt dice que la primera conclusión es correcta. El vidriero no va a
estar más apesadumbrado por el vandalismo de esos muchachos que el dueño de
la funeraria por la muerte de alguien. Al panadero, sin embargo, le va a
costar $250 que pensaba más bien gastarse en la compra de un traje nuevo. La
ganancia del vidriero va a ser a costa del sastre. Desde el punto de vista
de la comunidad, esta se empobrece por el valor de un traje que hubiera sido
confeccionado. Es fácil concluir que el vandalismo estimula la economía
porque se verá la nueva ventana, pero como el panadero no puede ahora
comprase el traje, el desempleo del sastre resulta invisible.
<P>Hay muchas maneras en que se nos engaña con diferentes versiones de la
falacia de la ventana rota. Algunos maestros enseñan que aunque la Segunda
Guerra Mundial fue espantosa, nos sacó de la Gran Depresión. No es así. Hubo
un incremento en la demanda por armamentos y Estados Unidos tenía los
recursos para fabricar el equipo de guerra. Pero esos recursos hubieran
podido ser utilizados en fabricar casas, automóviles y neveras.
<P>Una variante de la falacia de la ventana rota es cuando el alcalde, los
jefes sindicales y la cámara de comercio nos dicen que tenemos que gastar
dinero proveniente de los impuestos para construir un centro de
conferencias, un estadio o un puente, por los empleos que se crearían. Los
impuestos provienen de los contribuyentes. Si los contribuyentes no se ven
obligados a pagar esos impuestos gastarán su dinero en carros, muebles, la
remodelación de sus casas y demás cosas que también crean empleo. Así que al
igual que en el cuento de la ventana rota, algunos empleos se crean,
mientras que otros desaparecen o no se llegan a crear. La ventaja para los
políticos que fomentan el gasto público es que los empleos creados son
visibles, mientras los que se eliminan o no se llegan a crear resultan
invisibles.
<P>El Seguro Social es otra variante de la falacia de la ventana rota. Los que
apoyan el sistema se maravillan de los beneficios. No tienen idea cuánto
mejor estarían si hubieran colocado ese dinero en planes privados de
pensiones. Entonces, entre los beneficios tendríamos una tasa nacional de
ahorro superior, una tasa mayor de inversión, un producto interno bruto 18%
más grande, según algunas estimaciones. Todo eso es invisible, mientras que
los cheques del Seguro Social son visibles.
<P>Leer a Hazlitt lo convertiría a usted en una persona mejor informada que la
mayoría de los economistas. ©

ARGENTINA: PRIVATIZACION DEL SUBSUELO
-- 
11/14/96

<h2>
ARGENTINA: PRIVATIZACION DEL SUBSUELO
</h2>
Guillermo Yeatts*
<br>
<p>
BUENOS AIRES (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El Congreso argentino está debatiendo el tema de los
hidrocarburos, con el objeto de convertir en ley el decreto presidencial de
1989 que desreguló la industria petrolera, resultando en el aumento de 55%
de la producción. Lo que se pretende evitar es que un futuro gobierno repita
lo ocurrido en 1963, cuando por decreto se cancelaron las reformas
petroleras instrumentadas por la administración del presidente Frondizi en
1958. La historia de la actividad petrolera en la Argentina muestra
reiterados ejemplos de cómo los procesos aperturistas fueron neutralizados
por nuevas oleadas de intervención estatal.
<p>
Lamentablemente, el nuevo proyecto de ley reafirma la propiedad del estado
sobre el subsuelo, lo cual no evitará que se repita la historia. Mientras el
estado sea propietario de lo que está debajo de terrenos privados seguirá
siendo fácil regresar a la intervención estatal y se le cierran las puertas
al desarrollo agresivo de las provincias pobres.
Por el contrario, las leyes relativas al subsuelo en Estados Unidos siguen
la tradición inglesa: el dueño de la tierra es propietario de todo lo que
esté encima o debajo. Esto significa que la riqueza encontrada en el
subsuelo le pertenece al dueño del terreno. Ello incentiva la inversión y la
innovación tecnológica.	
<p>
Mientras en Estados Unidos la industria petrolera ya generaba riqueza a
fines del siglo XIX, nada parecido ocurría en la Argentina, donde regiones
enteras con gran potencial petrolero quedaban en el olvido y la pobreza. 
La conexión fundamental que existe entre las instituciones y el rendimiento
económico ha sido estudiada por el economista y premio Nobel Douglass North,
quien en 1993 escribió: "Las instituciones son las reglas del juego en una
sociedad o, más formalmente, son las limitaciones ideadas por el hombre que
dan forma a la acción humana. Por consiguiente, estructuran incentivos en el
intercambio humano, sea político, social o económico". La historia nos
enseña que cuando las instituciones crean incentivos positivos, la gente
actúa de manera productiva y cuando las instituciones reprimen los
incentivos se contrae la iniciativa privada.
<p>
En el caso argentino, las instituciones heredadas de España determinaron
que el subsuelo fuera propiedad del estado. Ya en el siglo XII, el rey de
Castilla se declaraba dueño de las riquezas minerales de su territorio,
tendencia que se acrecentó a partir del siglo XV, con el descubrimiento de
metales preciosos en América y simplemente lo que era del rey pasó a ser de
la nación. El Código de Minería de 1886 reconoció la propiedad pública del
subsuelo y la participación del sector privado quedó limitada a la forma de
concesión.
<p>
En 1865, apenas siete años después de que el negocio petrolero se iniciara
en Pennsylvania, en la provincia de Jujuy se gestaba el primer hallazgo de
este tipo en la Argentina. Leonardo Villa fue el empresario que intentó
explotar el petróleo en forma comercial para cubrir las demandas del mercado
de kerosene para alumbrado público, tal cual estaba sucediendo en Estados
Unidos desde 1858. Pero la iniciativa de este pionero chocó contra una
impenetrable muralla. Para comenzar la explotación, Villa se vio obligado a
solicitar autorización a las autoridades de la provincia y luego al poder
legislativo nacional, lo cual, tras infinitos vaivenes, le fue denegado. El
estado, dueño del subsuelo, no permitió que el negocio se concretara. Igual
suerte corrieron otros pioneros hacia fines del siglo XIX.
<p>
Paralelamente, en Titusville, Pennsylvania, el negocio petrolero -iniciado
en 1858- había alcanzado niveles insospechados. Contrariamente a lo sucedido
en la Argentina, el impulso de aquel grupo de visionarios que vio en el
aceite mineral una alternativa para reducir el elevado costo del alumbrado
no fue frenado por la intervención del estado. La leyes de Estados Unidos
alentaron la inversión, la toma de riesgo y la innovación tecnológica.
<p>
Con el correr del tiempo, la intervención estatal argentina se incrementó a
partir de la declaración de zonas de reserva para la exploración y
explotación, el incremento de las regulaciones y, finalmente, la creación de
Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) en 1922. Los años que siguieron
acrecentaron la voracidad de estado y restringieron aún más la limitada
participación del sector privado. El nacionalismo económico y su concepción
del petróleo como recurso estratégico excluyeron casi completamente a los
particulares de la actividad, lo cual alcanzó su punto máximo con la
nacionalización de los recursos energéticos en la Constitución de 1949. La
desregulación de la actividad petrolera iniciada con los decretos de 1989,
si bien constituyó un cambio radical dado que la producción se incrementó de
27 millones en 1989 a 42 millones de metros cúbicos en 1995, y liberó el
comercio petrolero, no concretó el cambio institucional de privatizar
totalmente este sector.
<p>
La mentalidad estatista condenó a las regiones no agropecuarias a la
marginalidad y a la pobreza. Hoy en día, 80% del subsuelo argentino sigue
sin haber sido explorado. Lo que habría que hacer es proceder a un cambio
institucional fundamental, traspasando la propiedad del subsuelo a los
dueños de las tierras. La privatización del subsuelo acabaría con el freno
artificial sufrido por la industria petrolera argentina por más de 100 años. ©

<H2>APRENDIENDO FUERA DE LA UNIVERSIDAD</H2>
Karl Zinsmeister*<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
Hace unos años, el autor George Gilder escribió en el
anuario de Harvard que una vez terminados sus estudios se había concentrado
"en un laborioso esfuerzo para redescubrir las verdades aprendidas de mi
madre… mi padre y que desaprendí en la universidad". De manera parecida, el
poeta Robert Frost dijo, en la conferencia dictada ante los graduados de
Dartmouth en 1955, que había hecho un particular esfuerzo "de pasar por la
universidad manteniéndome como soy para no ser cambiado completamente… es
una pobre clase de persona, creo yo, la que se siente satisfecha pensando
'me han transformado en una persona que ni mi madre reconocería'".
<P>Se trata de importantes críticas a la educación universitaria porque las
universidades no sólo difunden conocimientos sino que también los destruyen.
Y las instituciones de altos estudios se sienten cada día con más derecho a
borrar otros tipos de conocimiento.
<P>Alguna "deseducación" es valiosa, específicamente aquella que destruye
falsos prejuicios. Pero gran parte de la variedad contemporánea no va en
contra de falsedades sino en contra del sentido común que ha evolucionado a
través de la historia, lo mismo que contra nexos humanos naturales. En áreas
que van desde el sexo, el lenguaje, la estructura familiar y las creencias
religiosas, muchos profesores se empeñan hoy en corroer las costumbres
tradicionales, rechazando juicios inmemoriales y descontando la sabiduría de
los padres, extirpando las creencias fuera de moda.
<P>¿Dónde en el mundo académico de hoy se acepta la fe católica, judía
ortodoxa, evangélica protestante? Y ni hablar de la mormona o musulmana.
¿Cuán aceptado entre académicos es la creencia de la mayoría de los
americanos de que hay diferencias biológicas importantes entre el hombre y
la mujer? ¿Cuán tolerantes son las universidades de los puntos de vistas
mayoritarios en cuanto al crimen, la homosexualidad, la pena de muerte y el
servicio militar?
<P>Una reciente encuesta hecha por mi revista, The American Enterprise, mostró
que sólo entre 2% y 6% de los profesores de humanidades en las mejores
universidades de Estados Unidos son republicanos. ¿Adónde quedó la amplia
gama de perspectivas y la discusión de puntos de vista antagónicos que las
universidades dicen patrocinar? Más bien encontramos una vanidosa seguridad
y hostilidad contra las ideas "reaccionarias" que los estudiantes traen.
<P>El problema es que las universidades ejercen un monopolio en la educación
superior y se sienten con el arrogante derecho de cancelar las verdades
intelectuales o morales aprendidas fueras de sus muros.
<P>En la universidad donde estudié, perteneciente al Ivy League (asociación de
las ocho universidades más antiguas y prestigiosas de Estados Unidos),
recibí una menor exposición a las obras clásicas de la literatura y la
historia de la que considero merecen recibir los estudiantes. Los temas
religiosos se ignoraban y no aprendí nada útil acerca de cómo crear un
matrimonio feliz, una familia y un hogar. Por el contrario, recibí mucha
información contraproducente. Y si usted piensa que esos temas van más allá
de la esfera universitaria, recuerde que los sabios desde Platón hasta San
Agustín y Austen dedicaron el mayor interés intelectual a esos asuntos.
Lanzar a los estudiantes al mundo sin haber sido expuestos a la evolución de
la sabiduría en temas cotidianos es una grave falla educativa.
<P>No estoy predicando oscurantismo. El acceso a entrenamiento académico
formal es una gran cosa y obviamente es la misión principal de las
universidades. Pero debemos recordar que hay múltiples caminos hacia el
conocimiento y los profesores universitarios difícilmente tienen el
monopolio de la sabiduría. Hoy los más brillantes eruditos tienden a ser los
más grandes críticos del mundo académico. El recién fallecido Allan Bloom,
traductor de Platón y de Rousseau insistía que sus abuelos, quienes apenas
si sabían leer y escribir, eran mucho más sabios que sus nietos con
múltiples doctorados.
<P>Los estudiantes deben ingresar a la universidad con suspicacia en cuanto a
que las autoridades académicas representan la fuente final de la verdad. Y
deben balancear su educación formal con una disciplinada educación informal.
Si el entrenamiento personal y familiar es simplemente suplantado por la
educación oficial, el resultado será una comprensión deformada y falsa del
mundo, especialmente ahora que las universidades son tan "políticamente
correctas", izquierdistas y apegadas a lo que intelectualmente está de moda.
<P>Los estudiantes universitarios deben estar conscientes que en lo que tiene
que ver con muchos de los aspectos de la vida, su experiencia personal es
superior a lo que hoy ofrecen las élites letradas. ©

Nicomedes Zuloaga*<br>

CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
El bienestar económico de una nación se mide por el consumo
de bienes materiales. Los países más prósperos consumen más alimentos, más
servicios y más bienes durables. Podemos, por lo tanto, afirmar que
bienestar es igual a desarrollo económico. Y, desde luego, no se puede
con-sumir lo que no se ha producido, aunque no es indis-pensable producir
localmente todo lo que se va a consumir. Constantemente se intercambian
bienes producidos en el país por otros producidos en el extranjero,
aumentando así la eficiencia. Pero los extranjeros no entregarán sus bienes
sino a cambio de otros, ya sea mediante el procedimiento arcaico del trueque
o la moderna transferencia de divisas. Es por lo tanto indispensable
producir para intercambiar. Consumo es igual a Producción.
<P>Esto nos lleva a lo que llamo la ecuación del bienestar: Desarrollo o
Bienestar = Consumo = Producción. Esta ecuación es válida con independencia
del sistema económico y político imperante. Es igualmente cierta para Angola
y para Alemania, para Venezuela y para Rusia, para Estados Unidos y para el
Japón.
<P>Podemos, entonces, afirmar que la única manera de aumentar el desarrollo
económico, el bienestar de la comunidad, es haciendo crecer el consumo a
través de un aumento de la producción. Y no existe otra forma de 
El Premio Nobel de la Paz Lord John Boyd Orr, en el prólogo de la edición
de 1962 de la "Geopolítica del Hambre", afirmó que dos terceras partes de la
humanidad estaban muriendo de hambre, técnicamente calculada esa hambre en
razón del consumo de proteínas, y que la solución era la transferencia
masiva de recursos de los países ricos de Occiden-te hacia el Tercer Mundo.
Afirmación errada según el proverbio chino, pero repetida durante años,
hasta el cansancio, en todos los foros inter-nacionales y a través de los
medios de comunicación. 
<P>Resulta que en estos 34 años los países desarrollados han transferido al
Tercer Mundo, mediante dádivas o présta-mos del Banco Mundial y del Fondo
Monetario Internacional -que jamás cobrarán- la astronómica cifra de
$170.000 millones, sin que haya mejorado el consumo de proteínas. Pero
seguimos oyendo y leyendo sobre la "injusta distribución" de la rique-za
mundial.
<P>Esa transferencia de fondos del sector público de los países desarrollados
al sector público de los países subdesarrollados, a manos de gobernantes
casi siempre corrup-tos del Tercer Mundo, ha cumplido sólo con la primera
parte del pro-verbio chino. Ha sido una transferencia masiva y astronómica
de fondos al mundo subdesarrollado, pero está muy lejos de haber sido
inversión en el sentido económico. Ha sido capaz, eso sí, de producir en el
mundo subdesarrollado una kleptocracia que se enriquece, una nueva casta
parásita de demagogos populistas que gana elecciones y por lo tanto tiende a
perpetuarse en el poder.
<P>Para que una inversión aumente la producción, el bienestar y el desarrollo
de la comunidad, tiene que ser inversión privada, sometida a las reglas del
mercado y de la competencia, tanto nacional como internacional. Esa
inversión, cuando es extranjera, además trae consigo una cultura industrial.
Con la inversión verdadera de capital extranjero se produce, además del
traslado de fon-dos, el traslado de procedimientos productivos, de
entrenamiento de personal y de aplicación de sistemas de producción, de
tecnología y mer-cadeo casi tan valiosos como el propio capital. Es esa
verdadera inversión un elemento indispensable para acelerar el desarrollo
económico. ©

<title>"First Principles in the Public Arena" -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Heritage Lecture No. 543</b>
<p>

<p>
<h3>"First Principles in the Public Arena"</h3>
<b>By Governor John Engler</b><br>
<p>
Michigan Governor Engler delivered the first <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">Russell Kirk Memorial Lecture</a> on Tuesday, September 26, 1995, at The Heritage Foundation, Washington D.C.
<p>

	This weekend, Michigan Republicans held a leadership conference on Mackinac Island. For all practical purposes, we met in honor of Dr. Russell Kirk. After listening to the various presidential candidates and to Speaker Gingrich, it was clear that many of the ideas Russell had written about since the 1950s not only had taken root, but had blossomed. He always said it took about 30 years for a new generation of ideas to enter the public arena--and in this, as in so much else, he proved right.
<p>
	I am honored to be in this redoubt of conservative thought to inaugurate the Russell Kirk Memorial Lectures. It is a humbling experience for me to stand in this auditorium, knowing that I follow in the footsteps of giants. Russell himself must have given some 60 lectures within these walls. In 1986, at a landmark Heritage event, President Reagan paid a wonderful tribute to the Sage of Mecosta, calling him a pillar of post-war conservative thought.
<p>
	Who could have foreseen it back in 1952, when Russell submitted a manuscript to Henry Regnery called <i>The Conservative Rout</i>? Strange as it may seem to us today, that was the original title Russell proposed for the classic the world would know as <i>The Conservative Mind</i>. Back in the early 1950s, Russell was concerned that there was not a more spirited defense of what he and T. S. Eliot called "the permanent things." But he never put his pen down in despair. Over the course of four decades, he wielded the "Sword of Imagination" against an "antagonist world" and gave new strength to conservative ideas.
<p>
	How the battle had turned at the close of the day, for Russell could see the makings of a liberal rout. One can only imagine what mordant comment he would have made about last November's historic elections and the resulting confusion and chagrin in the Liberal Mind, which more than a few are characterizing as brain-dead. Michigan's own Jack Kevorkian--otherwise known as Dr. Death--could be the poster boy of latter-day liberals.
<p>
	If you have ever been to St. Paul's Cathedral in London, you may have seen Sir Christopher Wren's tomb. Wren designed the cathedral and is buried there. On his tomb is an epitaph, which in translation reads, "If you seek my monument, look around you." I think that epitaph is apt for our purposes today, because if you seek a monument to Russell Kirk, look around  you.
<p>
	This foundation, this audience, and in significant ways this city, which today is becoming an epicenter of conservative policies and ideas, all bear Russell's mark. As Ed Feulner eulogized at last year's Memorial Mass in Russell's honor, the Sage of Mecosta "made a real impact on Washington. In a city of constant change, Kirk reminded opinion leaders, journalists, legislators, and staffers...of prudence and of taking the long view."
<p>
	Not just in Washington, but on both sides of the Atlantic, conservatives looked to Russell for inspiration and guidance. Closer to home, I sought his counsel as well. We both lived in central Michigan's "stump country," just two dozen miles from each other, and Russell was a trusted friend. He and Annette, whose hospitality is known around the world, always kept the door at Piety Hill open, not only for the refugee, the hobo, and the scholar, but also for a young legislator just out of college and eager to learn from Michigan's pre-eminent man of letters.
<p>
	I don't think Russell ever held public office except for a brief time as Justice of the Peace. He was, above all, a man of ideas. Yet he was wise to the nature of politics. He always used to say--and it's good advice to remember in Washington these days--that "politics is the art of the possible." The trick is not only to fight for reform, but to live to tell about it.
<p>
	As an aside, let me say that the Republican Party today has a great advantage over Democrats. It is conservative Republicans and their ideas that are driving the debate. And I think the more Americans get to know Republican ideas, the more they will vote for Republican candidates. But whatever their party affiliation, Russell had much to say to the men and women charged with the responsibility of governing. Nobody was more eloquent than Russell in defending what he called the "first principles" of conservative thought. At the center of these "first principles" is the apprehension that order, justice, and freedom are mutually dependent on one another.
<p>
	Another way Russell used to put it: For there to be order in society, there must be order in the soul--and vice-versa. You cannot have one without the other. So it is not just freedom, but ordered freedom that we must strive to preserve. Otherwise, the barbarians will come crashing through the gates.
<p>
	There are a number of first principles that Russell wrote about and that have been important to me as governor. What I would like to do today is tell you how I have tried to apply one of them in the public arena. It concerns the importance of community and the need to respect state and local government because they are closest to our communities.
<p>
	Here, as in so much else, Russell followed the lead of Edmund Burke. The great British statesman wrote that the true wellsprings of community are "the little platoons we belong to in society." By that quaint term, Burke was referring to the groups that we voluntarily seek to associate with and that give our lives meaning. Our church and alma mater, the professional and civic organizations to which we belong, the volunteer charities and friendships we seek out--these are the little platoons that enrich our lives and humanize our relations with one another.
<p>
	Russell early perceived that the centrifugal forces of modern times were tearing apart these little platoons, which are the fabric of our communities. He wrote:
<blockquote>
We have more voluntary organizations than has any other nation.... But it is tempting and easy to let centralized power assume the burdens which necessarily accompany the privileges of community.... I may add that this disintegration of community, and its supplanting by centralized authority, commonly have been accompanied by a proportionate decay of culture and morality.... A nation is no stronger than the numerous little communities of which it is composed.1</blockquote>	These words, though written some four decades ago, ring truer than ever today. They certainly resonate with Marvin Olasky's landmark work, <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, which I am sure Russell would have applauded. For in the court of public opinion, the verdict is in: We have seen the unintended consequences of a horrendous, $5 trillion experiment in centralized authority known as the Great Society. After three decades, even liberals are beginning to concede that the Great Society was neither great nor good for society.
<p>
	In one of his last Heritage lectures, Russell said that the centralizing tendency of the Great Society, combined with the centrifugal forces of modem times, had helped create "a mass of people who have lost...community, hope of betterment, moral convictions, habits of work, sense of personal responsibility, intellectual curiosity, membership in a healthy family, property, active participation in public concerns, religious associations, and awareness of the ends of human existence."2 How could this tragedy come about?
<p>
	At the diseased heart of the Great Society there evolved more than 300 welfare programs, a number of which rewarded ignorance, idleness, and illegitimacy--the absolute antithesis of the qualities you want a free citizenry to possess. These programs have worked untold mischief on the American republic.
<p>
	As many of you know, the welfare debate is a battleground on which, as governor, I have fought from the beginning. Soon after I took office, back in 1991, I made a priority of getting the Michigan legislature to abolish a state version of the Great Society	known as General Assistance. GA provided a monthly check to almost 100,000 able-bodied adults without children. In essence, it paid them not to work.
<p>
	We put an end to the program with some dispatch and said we wanted these tax-takers to become taxpayers. And you know what? Despite bitter denunciations in the liberal media at the time, not one of the four Democrats who challenged me in my 1994 re-election campaign called for the restoration of GA. That is significant because abolishing GA was, I believe, the first tangible sign in America that the nation was serious about ending welfare as we know it. Nobody else had said, "Get rid of a $250 million government welfare program; it won't exist next year." But that's what we did--and it signalled the beginning of the paradigm shift that is currently afoot.
<p>
	As my friends at the Heritage Foundation know, I have some thoughts about Washington's role in welfare. I am not an advocate of pruning federal programs, because those of you who are gardeners know that pruning just makes things grow faster than ever. What I advocate is getting a firm grip on the system as we know it and pulling it up by the roots. That means pulling welfare's roots out of Washington and letting the states decide what to transplant and what to reject. To stick with my gardening metaphor--and to use the words in a recent issue of <i><a href="/nationalreview/welcome.html">National Review</a></i>--let 50 flowers bloom instead of the weed patch in Foggy Bottom.
<p>
	As a result of last November's historic elections, the relationship between Washington and welfare is undergoing radical redefinition. Under Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader Dole, the l04th Congress is taking an extraordinary step: It is beginning the process of relinquishing power and returning it to the 50 states. Getting Washington out of the way is the crucial first step in the long process of returning authority and responsibility to where they ultimately belong--to the "little platoons" of civil society, our families and neighborhoods, churches and charitable organizations.
<p>
	In the area of welfare, I and other governors are hopeful that this historic opportunity will result in no-strings-attached block grants. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: There is no devil in devolution. No-strings-attached block grants are the first crucial steps to meaningful reform. But I am not content to stop there. Ultimately, the goal of welfare reform is to cut federal taxes and return all the fiscal and policy initiatives to the states. This is consistent with America's heritage. There are both constitutional and historical grounds for removing the federal government from such programs as Aid to Families with Dependent Children.
<p>
	Two weeks ago, the Heritage Foundation teamed up with the Federalist Society to present a working conference on the Tenth Amendment. I do not know whether Russell's book <i>The Conservative Constitution</i> was cited, but it should have been, because in it we are reminded that the Constitution set up a federal government that was to be supreme in its sphere, while the states were to remain supreme in their sphere. Washington and the states were meant to be co-sovereigns, with a host of undelegated powers reserved to the states. Welfare is one of those areas in which the states were meant to be supreme.
<p>
	This point is buttressed by the fact that our Founders never gave any indication that welfare should be the responsibility of the federal government. America was at its founding, and still is in many ways, a nation of immigrants, and almost 100 percent of the immigrants who have come to our shores have been poor. The men who drafted our Constitution knew the face of poverty. Despite numerous innovations that came out of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, no one called for giving the federal government a role in alleviating poverty. Yet over the last 60 years, as we have moved from the social insurance system proposed by FDR to the massive giveaway programs enacted by LBJ, Uncle Sam has become Big Daddy. And a tragic number of American citizens have been hurt in the process.
<p>
	I would not be so adamant about getting Washington out of the way if I did not think the states could succeed. If given a chance, the states can and will succeed. Remember the classic by Jonathan Swift, <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>? We in the states are like poor Gulliver on the beach, tied down by small-minded Lilliputians who remind me of the army of federal bureaucrats in Washington. If, like Gulliver, we can extricate ourselves from the entanglement of federal rules and regulations, we will be free to experiment and find better ways of truly helping the needy go to work and become independent.
<p>
	In Michigan, for example, an array of welfare reform initiatives over the past three years is yielding dramatic results. One goal of reform has been to get people to work and thereby enable welfare recipients to accept more responsibility for their lives. Because Michigan recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children must sign a Social Contract, they are working, training for a job, or volunteering in communities at least 20 hours a week. As a result, the number of Michigan AFDC recipients earning income is up to an all-time high of almost 30 percent, compared to just 8 percent nationally.
<p>
	A second goal has been to shrink the size of welfare rolls and save taxpayers money. Again, because of our enforced Social Contract, over 67,000 cases have been closed since 1992 because families are earning enough to be independent. Consequently, Michigan's AFDC caseload has declined to its lowest level in over two decades--and that is saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars as a result.
<p>
	A third aim of reform has been to keep at-risk families intact. In Michigan, our family preservation programs have a proven track record of reducing foster care and helping troubled families work through their problems. Much of our success is due to the fact that we contract out to private agencies, many of them church-run, because they an important moral element in the battle against poverty.
<p>
	Finally, the most critical objective has been to lower the illegitimacy rate. Efforts of the public-private Michigan Abstinence Partnership have helped bring about the lowest teen pregnancy rate in the Great Lakes State in a decade. However, our task--and America's task--is far from finished. In Michigan, 70 percent of births to teen mothers are to unwed teen mothers. If you think that is shocking, in Detroit it is 95 percent.
<p>
	My friends, this is a crisis of unprecedented proportions. As a state we could move even more aggressively to tackle the problem were it not for one thing--and that thing is the federal government. Like Gulliver, the states have been tied down by Lilliputians in Washington who make reform difficult, if not impossible.
<p>
	I hope the people who complain about the lack of federal control over welfare reform will look at the example of states like Michigan. I also hope they will acknowledge that the 50 governors have at least one credential that nobody in Washington has: We governors must actually administer the welfare system. We are closer to the problem than any federal bureaucrat. We know what works and what doesn't. We know what needs changing and how to change it. And if our reforms are not working, we can tackle the problem quickly rather than wait literally years for the federal government to act. Fifty states experimenting will create what are tantamount to market forces that will encourage governors and state houses to be responsible to both tax-takers and taxpayers.
<p>
	Whatever the final shape of welfare when the 104th Congress adjourns, more is at stake than whether this group of conservatives or that wins the debate. At bottom, this is a fight for the freedom of the states to exercise their constitutional authority and responsibility. If the states lose and Congress insists it has the right to micromanage welfare programs among the 50 states, then an important principle of freedom will have been compromised.
<p>
	But I do not think the states will lose. And in this I draw strength from our good friend, Russell Kirk. One of the things I appreciated most about Russell was his ability, no matter what the challenges, "to let a little cheerfulness break in."
<p>
		I want to close on the last words of one of the last lectures he delivered here at Heritage. This passage summarizes both his belief in the "little platoons" and his indomitable spirit of hope:
<p><blockquote>
		Spritually and politically, the twentieth century has been a time of decadence. Yet as this century draws to a close, we may remind ourselves that ages of decadence sometimes have been followed by ages of renewal.
<p>		What can you do, young men and women of the rising generation of the 1990s, to raise up the human condition?... Why, begin by brightening the corner where you are, by improving one human...yourself, and by helping your neighbor.
<p>	You will not need to be rich or famous to take your part in redeeming the time: what you require for that task is moral imagination joined to right reason....
<p>	Shrug your shoulders at things indifferent; set your face against things evil; and by doing God's will...find that peace which passeth all understanding.3
</blockquote><p>
	<i>Requiescat in pace</i>, my friend.

 The Heritage Foundation's research in the area of health care has always underscored the importance of consumer choice and patient power in our health care system.  Individual ownership of health care insurance and individual control of health care spending are critical if we are to contain health care costs and preserve the high quality health care delivery Americans have come to expect. <p>
 In 1994 at the time of the debates over the Clinton Health Care Plan, Heritage formed a Physicians Council made up of doctors who were concerned about the increasing role and interference of the federal government in the practice of medicine and the prospect of the Clinton Health Care Plan becoming a reality. Members of the Physicians Council helped Heritage publicize the details of the Clinton plan, its costs, its complexities, and its unprecedented control of both public and private health care spending.

<P>

	Today, the Physicians Council of The Heritage Foundation continues to play an active role in informing the medical and policymaking communities about what's at stake in the health care policy debates in Washington.  The Council brings together physicians from all over the country and from many different specialties.  It has no fancy offices and no high-paid lobbyists like many of the large medical societies.  Its aim is simple:  To communicate with patients and physicians about what reforms would mean and to provide ways to let politicians know the views of doctors.  The Heritage Foundation provides for the research needs of the Council and keeps members up-to-date on what is happening in health care reform through a broad range of easy-to-read studies and regular mailings.
<p>
	The Physicians Council is chaired by Heritage Board Chairman, David Brown, M.D., a retired orthopedic surgeon from Oklahoma City, OK.  The more than 700 members of the Council help Heritage leverage our own research and marketing efforts through their use of Heritage speakers, their use of our materials in their own communications, and their distribution of our publications to colleagues and patients.  The membership dues of the Council members ($250/year) help to fund much of the work of our health care analysts, the publication of our policy papers, and distribution of our <i>Physicians Council Reports</i>.  
<p>
	The past year has been an active one in the area of health care.  In 1995 Heritage's model became the framework for the legislation to reform Medicare.  The Heritage plan called for the "voucherization" of Medicare so that seniors could choose private alternatives to Medicare.  Ultimately, legislation did not pass the Congress, but we continue to work with members of Congress and senior staff aides on this issue.   In fact, our June 1996 <i>Physicians Council Report</i> titled, "<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/pcr3.html">Average Household Faces $14,000 Tax Bill to Keep Medicare Afloat</a>," highlights the urgent and continuing need to reform our Medicare system.
<p>
	On lessening the daily regulatory burdens doctors face, one Heritage paper has proved especially influential:  "<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1056.html">Cutting Red Tape on Clinical Labs:  Why Congress Should Deregulate Doctors</a>."  Written by Physicians Council member Sandra Mahkorn, M.D., the report was used by Representative Bill Archer to convince fellow Members of Congress of the need for his crucial reform legislation.  And another paper, "<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1059.html">Reforming Medicare:  What Congress Can Learn From the Health Plans of America's Corporations</a>," by Brenda Fitzgerald, M.D., was circulated throughout Congress by Congressman Charlie Norwood of Georgia.

<h3>Activities -- Second Quarter 1996</h3>
<p>
	Second quarter health care reform activities focused on providing the medical community with a better understanding of the elements of the Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform legislation and the latest news on the Medicare Trust Fund.  
<p>
	An April 24 Physicians Council dinner in Chicago brought Heritage members and staff together with AMA President-elect Daniel "Stormy" Johnson to discuss the AMA's public policy activities and positions on the latest health care legislation.  At this dinner, Johnson credited Heritage's Bob Moffit with educating the AMA board of directors on the fundamental flaws of our health care financing system, and Heritage Vice President Grace-Marie Arnett shared an early copy of her publication, <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/pcr2.html">"Cops And Doctors, Part II"</a> which broke the story on the very frightening waste, fraud, and abuse provisions contained in the Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation.  At this meeting, Johnson pledged to review these provisions, and the AMA subsequently mounted a substantial lobbying effort to remove or modify this portion of the bill.  This publication was released as a <i>Physicians Council Report</i>, and copies were distributed to Physicians Council members, Hill offices, and the AMA.

	On May 17, physicians who are members of the Heritage President's Club met with Rep. Greg Ganske, M.D. (R-IA) to discuss managed care's "gag rule" on doctors and brief them on his pending legislation addressing this issue.  And, our June 20-21 Physicians Council meeting brought members together for a program of panel discussions on the current political debate over health care reform and Medicare.  For the first time, we asked that presentations at this meeting incorporate a message of how to communicate our message to patients and colleagues.  And, we used this meeting to learn more about how Heritage can better work with doctors to deliver the message of consumer choice and competition in health care.
<p>

	Rep. Dennis Hastert (R-IL), chairman of the Speaker's Steering Committee on Health and the Resource Group on Health of the Health Care Task Force in the House of Representatives, opened our meeting with a dinner address.  Morning speakers included:   Stuart Butler, Marshall Wittmann, Grace-Marie Arnett, and Mike Franc, now Director of Communications for House Majority Leader Dick Armey.  Sen. Robert Bennett (R-UT), chairman of the Senate Republican Health Care Task Force, closed the meeting with a luncheon address on "Why We Need Tax Reform to Truly Reform our Health Care System."  Sen. Bennett's speech provided such a thorough and understandable overview of the problems of our health care financing system and the reforms necessary that we plan to publish his remarks as a <i>Heritage Lecture</i> and distribute these to our Council members, medical societies, and specialty organizations.

<p>
	Upcoming Activities:  The next meeting of the Physicians Council is scheduled for December 3-4 in Washington, D.C.

<H3>Corporate Responsibility</h3>
<p>
<table border=2 width=75% cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td>
	On Thursday, May 16, President Clinton and Vice President Gore will convene a White House conference on corporate responsibility.  CEO's have been invited to participate in a program of panel discussions that will highlight "good corporate citizens" and emphasize behavior the President wants other companies to follow.  What will President Clinton and the White House team propose, and what will America's CEO's report from the front line?  The Heritage Foundation's Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy Mark Wilson's essay below highlights several key issues business leaders should keep in mind when politicians turn to the topic of "corporate responsibility".
</td></tr></table></center>
<p>
	After three years of talking about economic insecurity and pursuing government solutions, President Clinton is now trying to walk a fine line between encouraging corporate citizenship and mandating it.  Hence, we see the White House promoting principles of corporate responsibility, while members of the President's Administration and political party propose more government mandates and incentives.  Americans are concerned about their jobs and wages, but in an election year politicians would rather focus that concern on business instead of the real problem: the high cost of government.
<p>
	Do companies have obligations beyond the bottom line?  Of course they do, but <b>the primary responsibility of companies is to produce the best possible products and services for the best possible price.  This, in turn, will ensure the most secure jobs for workers at the highest possible wages, as well as the highest profits for shareholders.</b>
<p>
	Striving to be competitive in a global marketplace does not mean that companies do not care about their workers or communities.  In fact, it can be argued that it is the competitive market forces a business faces every day, not government regulations, that cause it to be responsive to its customers, shareholders, employees, and communities.  For example:
<p><ul>
<li>Between 1942 and 1970, before the creation of OSHA, companies steadily improved workplace health and safety on their own as the total number of work-related injuries in the U.S. declined by 45 percent.  
<p>
 <li>Companies also recognize the goodwill generated by community giving.  In 1994, corporate giving totaled $6 billion.  Thirty-seven percent went to education, 26 percent went to health and human services, 12 percent went to cultural and arts activities, and 10 percent went to civic and community groups.
 <p>
<li>Companies also recognize the importance of training their workers.  Virtually all large establishments, and 69 percent of small establishments, provide some formal training to their workers.<sup>i</sup>  Over half of all establishments that provided formal training made it available to all employees.
</ul><p>
	Companies that are downsizing are not undertaking these measures just to increase their profits.  Rather, they are fundamentally restructuring how they operate in response to competition and to better serve their customers.  In a competitive marketplace no company can be sure how its customer demands will change, what its products will be, or even exactly what business it will be in five years from now.  Moreover, customers are demanding more for less.  If one company can not meet their needs, customers will look for another that does.  So, companies must remain flexible and innovative.
<p>
	The recent pummeling that business has taken in the press is largely undeserved.  And the President should be applauded for highlighting the positive contributions that companies make to society.  In fact, the innovation and invention inherent in business rarely gets much press or attention, but it is crucial to social progress and improvements in American living standards.  
<p>
	The problem, of course, is that politicians are not elected for talking about good deeds.  They are elected to solve problems by passing laws, creating programs, and legislating benefits.  Hence, we see liberals pressing for another mandated increase in the minimum wage and hailing the passage of the Family Medical Leave Act as a great accomplishment.  The dichotomy between the President's recent statement that the government can't make all companies do good things, and his proposal to mandate that all businesses provide health care insurance to their workers is a troubling contradiction.
<p>
	The public, Congress, and the President need to keep in mind that there are no government programs that will make layoffs disappear.  Mandating benefits and training will not eliminate layoffs or increase real wages.  Shutting off imports and immigration will not guarantee everyone a well-paying, secure job.  And sending every American to college will not end economic growth and its accompanying dislocations.  For as long as there has been economic progress, there have been layoffs.
<p><ul>
<li>Although over the past 15 years an average of 20 million workers per year experience at least one spell of unemployment, the economy has managed to create 25 million <i>net</i> new jobs. <sup>ii</sup>
<p>
<li>Sixty percent of the companies reporting job cuts in the twelve months ending June 1995, were also creating new positions at the same time.<sup>iii</sup>  The net workforce change in companies reporting job cuts was only -1.1 percent, down from -5.2 percent the year before.  Because of concurrent job creation, job elimination is no longer synonymous with downsizing.<sup>iv</sup>
<p>
 <li>Of business layoffs that involved 50 or more workers from October to December 1995, most were due to seasonal jobs ending (41.6 percent), slack work (12.2 percent), or the completion of contract work (8.4 percent).<sup>v</sup>  Company reorganizations, business ownership change, and domestic relocation together accounted for 10.9 percent of layoffs.  Import competition and overseas relocation together accounted for less than 1 percent.
 <p>
<li>Those companies that are downsizing many have taken a variety of actions to avoid workforce reductions.  Forty-three percent implement pay cuts and transfers, 40 percent offer voluntary separations, 10 percent offer voluntary job sharing.<sup>vi</sup>  Further, most downsizing companies (75 percent) offer a variety of outplacement assistance to laid-off workers.  Forty-six percent provide extended severance pay, 40 percent provide extended health coverage, and 19 percent provide job retraining.
<p>
<li>Seventy-five percent of all displaced workers who lost their jobs between January 1991 and December 1992 found new jobs.<sup>vii</sup>  Only 11.5 percent remained unemployed.
<p>
<li>Most displaced workers (53 percent) who found new jobs were earning the same as or more than their old job paid.  Over 27 percent were earning 20 percent more.<sup>viii</sup>  And, 82 percent of workers who were previously covered by group health insurance were covered in their new jobs.  Median weekly earnings, however, were 8.2 percent less than the old jobs, and over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old.<sup>ix</sup>
<p>
<li>Although the overall distribution of job duration has not changed over the last two decades, the distribution of long-term jobs across the population has changed in two ways.<sup>x</sup>  First, individuals, particularly men, with little education (less than twelve years) are substantially less likely to be in long-term jobs today than they were twenty years ago.  Second, women with at least a high-school education are substantially more likely to be in long-term jobs today than they were twenty years ago. 
</ul><p>
	Competition and economic change are a source of America's strength and opportunity.  Government mandates limit innovation by requiring a one-size-fits-all solution, and they will only diminish economic growth. Employment security in the 1990s and beyond will depend upon business flexibility and individuals' ability to adapt to the changing demands of jobs and the job market.  Workers who will fare the best are those with a good basic education, a strong work ethic, sound communication skills, and a willingness to relocate. 
<p>
	Corporate citizenship can not be enhanced with complex tax code changes, trade restrictions, or job-killing increases in the minimum wage.  Instead, what is needed are policies that focus on the primary problems: high taxes on labor and capital, and job-restricting regulations.  Correcting these problems will increase economic growth, real wages, and job opportunities.

<H3>How Congress Won the Budget War</H3></center>
<P>It’s one thing when Democrats attack the Republican-controlled 104th Congress for failing to deliver on its promises; it’s quite another when Republicans themselves start believing the charge.  For the fact is, in the crucial area of making real cuts in the federal budget, the 104th Congress has rung up a remarkable record of success, according to a new Heritage Foundation analysis.

<P>	Consider: When the 1996 budget process came to a close, Congress had made real cuts -- not phantom "baseline" cuts -- in discretionary spending for the first time since 1969, says Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow in Economics Ron Utt.  All told, it eliminated 270 federal programs, agencies, offices, and projects, reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices, and helped reduce the deficit to its lowest level since 1982.  

<P>"Fiscal conservatives in Congress may have lost a rhetorical battle with the president over the budget," Utt says, "but they won the budget war."

<P>	Specific programs Congress erased from the federal landscape include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp., the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Office of Technological Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Bureau of Mines.  Spending for many programs and agencies Congress failed to eliminate -- such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the Legal Services Corp. -- dropped substantially.

<P>	Utt’s conclusion: Congress’s accomplishments were "far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint." For example, Reagan proposed cutting the NEA by 27 percent and achieved 20 percent, but this Congress slashed the arts agency’s budget by 39 percent.  The same applies to the National Endowment for the Humanities, where Reagan’s goal of a 23 percent reduction (he got 20 percent) pales next to Congress’s 35 percent cut.  Similarly, mass-transit subsidies, targeted by Reagan for a 10 percent reduction, were cut 43 percent by the current Congress.

<P>	Granted, there’s much more Congress could have done, and still should.  "As impressive as this Congress’s performance was," Utt says,  "it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervade the federal government." He says first on Congress’s cut list should be out-of-control entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.  And while Congress found many opportunities to privatize federal programs such as the Naval Petroleum Reserve, another $8 billion to $20 billion could be saved just from privatizing the country’s four "power marketing administrations."

<P>	With work well underway on the fiscal year 1997 budget, Utt says Congress’s goal should be to shave another $20 billion off spending totals.  "This Congress cut discretionary spending for the first time since 1969," Utt says. "There’s no reason it can’t cut spending a second time."

<H3>PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS ON KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY</h3><p> 
<table border=2 width=75% cellpadding=7 cellspacing=7><tr><td>
	President Clinton signed the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care reform bill on August 21, 1996, and the provisions of the bill will become effective on July 1, 1997.  The exception being the four-year Medical Savings Account demonstration project, arguably the most "controversial" provision of the bill, which will become effective January 1, 1997. The huge margins of support for the bill in both the House and Senate reflect the deep desire of Members of Congress from both parties to address the serious and continuing problems faced by workers and their families in getting and keeping health insurance coverage.  Despite the voting margins, many Members remain concerned that specific provisions, even though drafted with the best of intentions, could have unintended and seriously damaging consequences.
<p>
	Over the next several weeks, in the wake of the political conventions and into the election, analysts, aides, and members of the business community will analyze the legislation to determine its impact on employees and businesses, as well as its impact on the American health care system.  Legal teams from the various professional associations will pore over the new law, trying to ferret out the meaning of some of the more abstruse provisions of this highly technical document, and you can be sure that they will find a few surprises--the unexpected always happens in the legislative process.  Heritage's Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies, <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert Moffit</a> shares his "preliminary observations" of the legislation below.
</td></tr></table></center>
<p>
	With the number of uninsured Americans rising by about a million a year, the 104th Congress was anxious to pass some type of health care reform legislation that would begin to address the serious problems facing the health insurance market.  Provisions of the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation are designed to reform the employer-based health insurance market and guarantee portability of insurance coverage for workers.  Our analysts believe that its provisions for guaranteed issue, limitations on pre-existing condition exclusions, and guaranteed renewal of policies may make health insurance coverage more <i>available</i> in the individual market, but they will not make it more <i>affordable</i>.  
<p>
	The bill increases the deductibility for the self-insured, but not by much.  And the long-fought-over MSA demonstration project most certainly will disappoint those longing for a more open market in health care.  The government will dictate MSA policies instead of letting them develop in response to consumer demands, and the four-year trial is limited to 750,000 MSAs -- hardly an incentive for the private sector to compete.  How did this happen?  And what else can we expect from the bill?
<p>
<b>1. The bill is the lowest common political denominator. </b>
<blockquote><p>
	The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill was the only vehicle that Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives and moderates could agree to vote on and pass into law this year.  It passed the Senate by 98 to 0; the House 421 to 2; only liberal Democrats Pete Stark of California and Pat Williams of Montana voted against it in the House of Representatives.  (Many in the business community know Congressman Stark as a major congressional champion of a single-payer system.)
<p>
	In one respect, this is a limited bill.  It has a very narrow focus, namely, health insurance regulation.  And, regardless of the particulars of health insurance rules, they are not decisive in terms of the structure of the market.  What is decisive is the tax treatment of health insurance and medical services.  At best, and putting the very best face on it, this bill should only be seen as a down payment on real market reform--and real market reform will come only with tax reform.  In that respect, we have not even begun to reform the American health care system.  In fact, we have a very long way to go.  
<p>
	The good news is that the debate on the tax treatment of health insurance and health care services is unavoidable, precisely because the debate on tax reform, including a major overhaul of our tax code, is unavoidable.  
</blockquote><p>
<b>2.  The American people should not expect dramatic changes resulting from the President signing the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.</b>  
<blockquote><p>
	We will not see a drop in health care costs.  Unfortunately, we probably will not see a drop in the rate of uninsurance either. Also, we will not see <i>true</i> portability in health insurance, like we have in auto insurance or homeowners insurance or life insurance, the kind of portability that we take for granted in all of these areas.  The reason:  Americans will still not be able to own their own health insurance policies, like they can in other areas of insurance, and take it with them when they change jobs.  Policies will still remain the property of employers. 
<p>
	Once again, we should remember that insurance regulation, no matter how well- or ill-intentioned, does not and cannot fix the major distortions in the broken health insurance market.  Only changes in the federal tax treatment of health insurance can do that.  This bill does <i>not</i> do that. 
</blockquote><p>
<b>3.  There are certain features of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill that will help millions of Americans who already have insurance at their place of work. </b>
<blockquote> 
<p>
	The bill sets up unprecedented federal ground rules for the health insurance market, so that Americans who are working will be able to keep health insurance from job to job.  In this way the new law does address the very real worries of millions of Americans who will lose health coverage if they get sick or lose their jobs.  It does this by establishing rules to guarantee, through regulation, portability of health coverage.  With guaranteed issue, health insurance companies must sell you policies in the individual market after you have exhausted your COBRA coverage.  With a limitation on exclusion of pre-existing medical conditions, they cannot deny you or your employer a policy because of your medical status.  With guaranteed renewability, your insurance company in the individual market cannot drop you if you get sick.
<p>
	The bill, therefore, will make health insurance coverage more <i>available</i> in the individual market.  It will not, however, make it more <i>affordable</i>.
</blockquote><p>
<b>4.  In fixing <i>some</i> problems in the health insurance market, the bill could create others.</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
	The American health insurance market is one of the most highly regulated sectors of the American economy.  This regulation is overwhelmingly done at the state level, and state regulation imposes rules on insurance ranging from rate setting for doctors and hospitals to mandating that companies include very specific benefits, everything from in vitro fertilization to psychological counseling.  These state regulations are costly for individuals, families, and small businesses.  In the state of Maryland, for example, these mandates add about 25 percent to the costs of health insurance premiums.  Furthermore, the bill creates two potentially serious problems:
<p><ul>
<li><b><i>First, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill adds a new layer of federal regulation on top of the existing morass of state rules.</i></b>  The concern among analysts at The Heritage Foundation and elsewhere is that the new federal rules will drive health care costs up.  The reasons:  nobody, no matter how sick, can be denied health insurance; nobody's health insurance can be canceled, except for cause, such as fraud; your medical conditions are henceforth not a barrier to health insurance.  Of course, many medical professionals find these changes desirable. 
<p>
These new federal rules may establish equity of sorts among patients--which is what they are designed to do--but, taken alone, without any other offsetting market changes, they will add to the cost of insurance.  We don't all automatically win.  There will be losers with this bill: those who become uninsured because they can't afford the premium increases or because individual insurers in this new and even more highly regulated environment may withdraw from the market. 
<p>
How much will costs go up?  Nobody knows for sure but there are a range of estimates.  The American Academy of Actuaries says that it will be a modest increase, between 3 and 5 percent.  Individual insurers say we will see anywhere from 10 to 30 percent increases in the individual market.  The increases and adjustments are hard to predict in a rapidly changing employer-based market.  But, in any case, we should be going into this with our eyes open. 
<p>
<li><b><i>Second, the bill sets up a vast, federal data collection apparatus at the federal level, including the storage and sharing of patient records. </i></b>    Each person will have, under the bill, a "patient identifier" code, and this is designed to simplify the administration of the system.  In the text of the conference report, the Congress restates its good intention to protect privacy.  Good intentions are not enough.  As the <i>Washington Post</i> pointed out recently, unauthorized leaks could result in confidential data being sent into electronic mailboxes all over the country.  At The Heritage Foundation we are more than a little nervous about the potential for abuse. This is only the first controversial issue to surface with the passage of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.  There will doubtless be others.
</ul><p>
	A "technical corrections" bill will likely be introduced early next year to fix the glitches created by various provisions of  Kassebaum-Kennedy.  Two items should be at the top of the agenda:  First, further modification or elimination of unnecessary fines and penalties on doctors.  My colleagues at The Heritage Foundation have opposed, on sound federalist principle, the nationalization of criminal law, usurping or overriding the authority of the states.  There are today over 3,000 criminal laws.  The Kassebaum-Kennedy Bill has added a half dozen more of them.  While Members of Congress insist that they have heard the message from physicians justifiably angry over the imposition of new fines and penalties amidst the growing underbrush of thorny and complicated rules and regulations.  Members of Congress claim to have "fixed" the problem, but we believe that more can be done to protect honest physicians from overzealous bureaucrats.  If Congress remains conservative, the deregulation of the medical profession should be a top priority, just as the deregulation of agriculture and communications has been a top priority in this Congress.  
<p>
	Second, no personal medical record should be turned over to any public or private agency without the express, written permission of the patient. 
</blockquote><p>
<b>5. The Kassebaum-Kennedy Bill could have, but didn't, advance health care reforms that would have made the American system work better for individuals and families. </b>
<blockquote><p>

	<b><i>First, the bill is not nearly generous enough in providing tax relief to individuals and families, regardless of where they work or even the status of their employment.</i></b>  It increases the deductibility for the self-insured from 30 percent to 80 percent--by the year 2006!  While this is a step in the right direction, in itself it is no big deal.  It falls far short of tax equity for individuals and families--and there is not much pizzazz in waiting ten years for the full implementation of a measure that will approach a bare modicum of tax equity.
<p>
	Real tax relief either in the form of tax credits or vouchers for low-income persons, would be a far more generous approach.  It would expand personal choice for individuals and families, and make health insurance and health care itself more affordable.  In any case, tax credits would be more equitable than deductions, especially for lower-income and lower-middle income working families.  
<p>
<b><i>Second, a related item, the MSA demonstration program looks as if it were designed to fail.</i></b>  We hope it doesn't fail, but that's how it looks.  The four-year demonstration project imposes a cap of 750,000 policies that get tax equity, including the self-employed and individuals in firms with anywhere between 2 and 50 employees.  And it is hobbled by literally dozens of statutory conditions on employers and insurers, too extensive and intricate to enumerate here; and it requires a tight policing of these policies by the IRS. 
<P>
	With all of the attendant paperwork, two problems are immediately evident:  (a) small employers are wrestling with too much government paperwork now.  And this program, with its strict reporting requirements and conditions, is hardly designed to make it an attractive option for harried small businesses; (b) such an artificially small pool of potential policyholders--over a four-year period--is not likely to be inviting to a broad spectrum of commercial insurers.  This means that only a small number of insurers currently specializing in high-deductible polices, who are also willing to put up with the government's regulatory regime, will venture to participate.  The likely result: premiums will be higher than if the option were open to a much broader competition. 
<p>
	If you are interested in a demonstration of the dynamism of the market, the powerful and fruitful collision of the forces of supply and demand, designed to unleash free market forces, this is not it.  This is a political compromise.  Others can judge who got the best of the compromise; the market reformers or the regulators?  Furthermore, the very premise of a demonstration program for medical savings accounts also should be questioned.  Over 2,500 companies already have adopted MSA's, and we know that they are very popular with employees and have been successful in controlling costs in the companies where they are used.  And, as for adverse selection, employers have managed risks with managed care, and there is no reason why they can't manage risks with Medical Savings Accounts.  Moreover, they are popular with employees, even though their savings accounts are subject to federal and state taxation and thus are hobbled by an unfair discrimination in tax treatment.
<p>
	The opposition to individual tax relief and Medical Savings Accounts seems to be grounded in fear; not a fear that they are a bad idea or will fail, but rather that they are an excellent idea and will succeed.  Once individuals and families have individual tax relief, they will pick and choose their own plans and policies, their own doctors and medical treatments and procedures.  And, liberals in Congress know that once families start exercising this level of personal choice, they will never - politically -- be able to take that freedom of choice away.  Families with Medical Savings Accounts are hard, if not impossible, for regulators to regulate; huge, consolidated managed care networks, dominated by a few large insurers in any given area of the country, are comparatively easy to regulate.  It is also easy to transition from such a consolidated corporate system into a single-payer system.
<p>
	The short-term value of Medical Savings Accounts, even in the truncated form found in Kassebaum-Kennedy, is that it will give some employers another health care option that can help them hold down costs, and it will give thousands of individuals and families the power to choose their own physicians, medical treatments, and medical services.  And ultimately this is the kind of health care system Americans want.  
<p>
	Unfortunately, we still have a lot of work to do to get there.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
China's July 21-26 missile test about 100 miles north of Taiwan
was a blatant act of intimidation. Armed with nuclear warheads,
these Chinese missiles could be used to devastate American bases
or naval formations in Asia, which lack adequate missile defenses.
China's attempt to threaten the Republic of China challenges the
United States to provide its forces and friends with appropriate
defenses. Unless America responds, China's future nuclear intimidation
could destabilize Asia by driving others in the region to seek
their own nuclear deterrent.
<P>
To avoid this, the U.S. should incorporate missile defenses into
its strategy to deter aggression in Asia. At the same time, Washington
should emphasize missile defense cooperation as an effective alternative
to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Clinton Administration's
focus on short-range, theater-based missile defense (TMD) systems
is inadequate. The Administration can enhance security in Asia
by pursuing a strategy that defends Americans against missile
attack and extending that umbrella to America's allies and friends
in the region. Such a strategy should include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Building and deploying</B> a missile defense system for the United
States. In order to defend its allies, America itself must
be defended from missile attack.
<P>
<LI><B>Improving</B> the defense of U.S. forces in Asia by accelerating
development and deployment of the Navy's Upper Tier system to
the Pacific Fleet and the Army's THAAD system to U.S. forces in
South Korea and Japan.
<P>
<LI><B>Encouraging</B> Australia, Japan, and South Korea to acquire
advanced U.S. TMD systems and promote multilateral missile defense
cooperation.
<P>
<LI><B>Telling</B> China to live up to its nonproliferation commitments
and offering to share missile defense technology if China agrees
to verifiable nuclear missile limitation.
<P>
<LI><B>Selling</B> advanced theater missile defense systems to Taiwan,
consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act, and preparing U.S. naval
TMD forces to help defend Taiwan.
<P>
<LI><B>Offering</B> India and Pakistan a deal:  If they agree to negotiate
verifiable limits and reductions of their nuclear and missile
forces, the U.S. will offer them access to satellite intelligence
to verify agreements and technology to help defend against missile
attack.
</ul>
<P>
<b>ASIAN MISSILE THREATS AND PROLIFERATION DANGERS</b>
<P>
<B>China's Global and Regional Threat. </B>China's nuclear missile
program dates back to the mid-1950s and has grown to include several
classes of nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. China is believed
to have about 300 nuclear warheads for its missile force. <sup>1</sup> By
the year 2120, according to one estimate, China could have 50
to 70 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching
the United States from bases in China. <sup>2</sup>  Two mobile ICBMs are under
development  the 5,000-mile-range DF-31 and the 7,500-mile-range
DF-41. The DF-31, tested on May 29, 1995, could reach the Western
U.S. if fired from Northern China. China deploys four DF-5 missiles
which can carry a 4 to 5 megaton warhead over 8,000 miles and
10 DF-4 missiles with a 3,000-mile range. China has one to two
nuclear missile submarines which can carry 12 of the 1,000-mile
Julang-1 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). The 5,000-mile-range
<I>Julang-2</I>, a variant of the DF-31, is under development.
<P>
China also possesses several intermediate-range and tactical nuclear-capable
missiles. Since the mid-1980s it has build over 30 DF-21 missiles
with a 1,125-mile range. It also may have more than 60 older and
less accurate DF-3 1,700-mile-range missiles. Chinese nuclear-capable
tactical missiles include the 185-mile-range DF-11 (M-11) and
the 375-mile-range DF-15 (M-9). According to Chinese military
analyst Dr. Chong Pin Lin, China has hired Russian technicians
and may have purchased a complete missile plant from Russia, to
produce long-range cruise missiles similar to the U.S. <I>Tomahawk.</I> <sup>3</sup>
 China is developing Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) that
emit precise navigation signals. With such a capability, Chinese
ballistic and cruise missiles could acquire high degrees of accuracy. <sup>4</sup>

<P>
In 1993 China reportedly purchased 60 Russian S-300s, comparable
in capability to the U.S. Patriot missile, which can intercept
tactical ballistic missiles, such as the Russian Scud, in flight. <sup>5</sup>
 Thus, China already has a limited anti-tactical ballistic missile
(ATBM) capability.
<P>
China's nuclear strategy against the United States and Russia
is often described as one of &quot;minimum deterrence,&quot; targeting
its small number of ICBMs on U.S. or Russian cities. However,
Beijing clearly employs a more active strategy with its intermediate
and tactical missiles. The &quot;testing&quot; of DF-21s and M-9s
near Taiwan was China's first high-profile use of missiles to
intimidate an opponent. The M-9 missiles were fired from Leping
Military Base in the Jaingxi Province west of Taiwan; Taipei is
just at the edge of the M-9's 370-mile range from this base. <sup>6</sup> 
DF-21 missiles are deployed from bases where they can threaten
Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and India. <sup>7</sup>
 With the assistance of PLA Navy tracking ships, DF-21 missiles
also could be used to attack U.S. Navy carrier task groups. From
China's Hainan Island in the South China Sea, DF-21 missiles could
counter U.S. naval forces transiting the Straits of Malacca.
<P>
<B>North Korea's Current and Future Threat. </B>North Korea's
extensive missile program is often overshadowed by its nuclear
weapons development program. <sup>8</sup>  But its ballistic missile program
deserves equal attention. It was revealed in 1994 that North Korea
was developing two long-range missiles, dubbed the Taepo Dong-1
&amp; 2 with estimated ranges of 1,200 miles and 2,000 miles,
respectively. These missiles would give North Korea the capability
to target U.S. forces in Guam. According to recent South Korean
and Russian estimates, the Taepo Dong-2 could have a 6,200-mile
range, which would cover about half the continental U.S. <sup>9</sup>  At this
estimated range, the Taepo Dong-2 also could reach Europe, all
of East Asia, and Australia. Some U.S. estimates, however, give
this missile only a 2,500-mile range, and it is not expected to
be operational before the year 2000. In a June 1994 statement,
the head of U.S. Naval Intelligence estimated a North Korean missile
could carry a nuclear warhead by the year 2000, or possibly as
early as this year. <sup>10</sup>
<P>
North Korea tested a variant of the Scud in May 1993. Called the
<I>Nodong-1 </I>, it has an estimated 625-mile range and is capable
of threatening U.S. forces in Japan. North Korea was reported
to have had 12 to 18 <I>Nodong-1 </I> missiles in early 1994. <sup>11</sup>
 There are also reports that the North is developing a solid-fueled
930-mile transportable variant, the Nodong-2, with the help of
Russian technicians. <sup>12</sup> 
<P>
Pyongyang began producing the 185-mile-range Scud-B in the mid-1980s,
after gaining advanced missile design knowledge from China and
from copying a <I>Scud-B</I> obtained from Egypt, most likely
in 1981. <sup>13</sup>  Pyongyang began production of the improved 300-mile-range
Scud-C in 1991 and is now estimated to be producing that missile
at a rate of 100 a year. The Scud-C is a mobile missile capable
of carrying high explosive, biological, or chemical warheads.
It has a range enabling it to reach all of South Korea. The North
is believed to maintain a total of 24 to 36 Scud-Cs in its Army.

<P>
According to Robert D. Walpole, Deputy Director of the CIA's Nonproliferation
Center, &quot;North Korea is the largest proliferator [in the
world] of ballistic missiles.&quot; <sup>14</sup>   Pyongyang uses missile sales
to earn hard cash for oil. By one estimate North Korea has sold
Iran and Syria a total of 320 Scud-Cs. <sup>15</sup>  It also has enhanced Iran's
missile production capability. In turn, Iran may be providing
North Korea with missile test facilities. <sup>16</sup>  Although North Korea
has discussed missile sales with Libya, Walpole believes that
Iran probably will be the first to purchase <I>Nodong</I> missiles.
<P>
<B>India and Pakistan. </B>India and Pakistan have fought each
other in 1947, 1966, and 1971. In recent years both countries
have almost come to blows over the disputed state of Kashmir in
Northern India. Their nuclear competition dates from the 1970s.
Although claiming not to be a nuclear state, India is believed
to have exploded a 12-kiloton nuclear device in 1974, and Shekhar
Gupta, Senior Editor of<I> India Today</I>, estimates India has
enough fissile material to build 60 bombs. <sup>17</sup>  The opposition Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) is committed to building a nuclear arsenal
and may lead the government after national elections early in
1996. Meanwhile, Pakistan is believed to have enough plutonium
for seven crude nuclear weapons. <sup>18</sup>  Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD)
charged in April of this year that he believes Pakistan has five
nuclear weapons and India possesses between five and ten. <sup>19</sup>  The
inability of the Bush Administration in 1990 to certify that Pakistan
lacked a nuclear weapon triggered provisions of the 1986 Pressler
Amendment barring U.S. military sales to Pakistan.
<P>
Both states are developing missiles that could be nuclear armed.
India is deploying the indigenously developed 150-mile-range Prithvi
 to reserve Army units. <sup>20</sup>  This is a liquid-fueled, mobile missile.
India is estimated to have 40 to 50 <I>Prithvi </I> missiles,
with the intention of building up to 80. <sup>21</sup>  In 1992 India tested
a variant of the liquid-fueled and immobile <I>Agni </I> missile
that flew over 1,500 miles. It is now considering deploying this
missile, <sup>22</sup> which is capable of reaching most of Pakistan and many
targets in China. Additionally, India is developing an Advanced
Space Launch Vehicle (ASLV) for commercial purposes, and this
could become a 2,500-mile-range missile. In 1993 the United States
stopped Russia from selling ICBM engine technology to India but
did go ahead and sell complete rocket engines that could assist
India in building more powerful missile engines.
<P>
With China's assistance, Pakistan began the development of its
Haft missiles in the early 1980s. First tested in 1989, the <I>Haft-1</I>
has a range of only 50 miles. Also under development are the 185-mile
<I>Haft-2 </I>and 375-mile <I>Haft-3</I> missiles. In 1991 U.S.
officials revealed that Pakistan was purchasing the 185-mile Chinese
M-11. <super23></sup>  Pakistan received transporter-erector-launchers for the
M-11 in February 1991 from China. In July 1995, U.S. spy satellites
discovered over 30 M-11 delivery cases at an air force base in
Pakistan. <sup>24</sup> 
<P>
Future Indian long-range ballistic missiles may be capable of
reaching U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. However,
India's and Pakistan's potential nuclear missile arsenals are
mainly to deter each other, while India also seeks to deter China.
While it would not threaten the United States, a nuclear missile
exchange between India and Pakistan would create incalculable
destruction and loss of life, fuel religious and ethnic conflict,
and destabilize South Asia and the Persian Gulf for decades.
<P>
<b>DIPLOMACY ALONE WILL NOT PREVENT PROLIFERATION </b>
<P>
Washington has tried diplomacy and sanctions to prevent nuclear
and missile proliferation in Asia. While these attempts have been
worthwhile, they have not stopped proliferation. China signed
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1992 but continues
to export nuclear technology. Most recently China is reported
to have sold Iran a calutron for enriching uranium, a critical
missing link in Iran's nuclear weapons program. <sup>25</sup>  China twice has
promised but failed to abide by the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR), which forbids the sale of missiles with ranges
over 185 miles. <sup>26</sup>  However, evidence is accumulating that China
earlier this year shipped more than 30 M-11s to Pakistan. <sup>27</sup>
<P>
North Korea signed the NPT in 1985 but has failed to comply fully
with its terms. For example, it refused until 1992 to allow inspections
by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as required by
the pact and threatened to withdraw from the pact in March 1993
in reaction to IAEA requests to inspect a nuclear waste dump.
This dump, which would have yielded information on the extent
of North Korean plutonium production, still has not been inspected.
In addition, North Korea has yet to fulfill a pledge, made to
South Korea in 1991, to create a non-nuclear Korean Peninsula.
The threat of limited United Nations sanctions in 1994 forced
Pyongyang to agree to &quot;freeze&quot; its nuclear program.
In October 1994 North Korea agreed to freeze and then dismantle
its existing nuclear program in exchange for two light-water nuclear
power plants that would be financed and built by an international
consortium. However, the pact allows Pyongyang to delay full IAEA
inspections for five years or more and stipulates that these inspections
will not begin until &quot;significant components&quot; of the
reactors are delivered.
<P>
Pyongyang has challenged and will likely continue to challenge
the implementation of this complex agreement.<sup>28</sup>  Pyongyang's objections
to Seoul's role in building the proposed light-water reactors
heightened tensions and again led to a flurry of U.S.-North Korean
negotiations this Spring and to further delay in the agreement's
implementation. Meanwhile, it is possible that North Korea continues
nuclear weapons-related research and development in locations
unknown to the IAEA  which cannot undertake full-scope inspections.
North Korea also refuses to join the MTCR. North Korea's ability
to undermine the NPT and IAEA and flout the MTCR all demonstrate
the weakness of diplomacy in stemming nuclear proliferation.
<P>
Both India and Pakistan also have refused to sign the NPT and
join the MTCR. The Pressler Amendment sanctions against Pakistan,
which have barred U.S. military sales since 1990, have yet to
convince Islamabad to end its nuclear weapons program. The Bush
Administration tried, but failed, to convince India and Pakistan
to negotiate a South Asian Nuclear Free Zone.<sup>29</sup>  In 1994 Pakistan
rejected a Clinton Administration proposal that the United States
and NATO guarantee Pakistan's security if it denuclearized.<sup>30</sup>
<P>
<b>THE DANGERS OF A WEAKER U.S. DETERRENT IN ASIA</b>
<P>
America's extended nuclear and conventional force deterrent is
the foundation of security in the Asia-Pacific region. This American
commitment obviates the need for allies and friends to build their
own nuclear deterrent. The possibility of nuclear proliferation
in Asia increases when America's commitment is undermined, either
from Washington or by new nuclear threats. After China's threatening
July missile tests, in Taiwan's parliament on July 28, Taiwan
President Lee Teng-hui responded to a question from opposition
Democratic Progressive Party member Liu Jui-hsiung on whether
Taiwan should develop nuclear weapons. &quot;Whether [we] need
nuclear weapons would require long-term study,&quot; Lee said.
&quot;Taiwan used to have the capability to build nuclear weapons
but it caused international concern and damaged the country's
image.&quot;<sup>31</sup> 
<P>
Indeed, it was the Carter Administration's decision to end diplomatic
relations with Taiwan and its attempt to reduce U.S. troops in
South Korea that increased interest in nuclear weapons in both
countries. Washington convinced Taipei not to proceed with attempts
to acquire plutonium in the late 1970s and to end nuclear weapons-related
research in the late 1980s.<sup>32</sup>  A retired South Korean general has
disclosed that in the late 1970s South Korea almost completed
an atomic bomb, but the project stopped after pressure from Washington.<sup>33</sup>

<P>
Although, although Japan's national policy since 1971 has been
not to manufacture, possess, or allow the introduction of nuclear
weapons into Japan, in 1994 then-Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata unnerved
many with the comment that &quot;It is certainly the case that
Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons, but has not
made them.&quot;<sup>34</sup>  Only a series of cataclysmic events, such as
a rupture of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty combined with nuclear
proliferation on the Korean Peninsula, would likely move Japan
to build nuclear weapons.<sup>35</sup> 
<P>
Missile technology is also widespread throughout Asia. Japan's
H-2 commercial space-launch vehicle conceivably could be turned
into a 9,300-mile-range ICBM. The South Korean Army deploys the
150-mile <I>NHK-1 </I>tactical missile. In June, Seoul reportedly
asked Washington to scrap a 1979 agreement that bars South Korea
from building missiles that travel more than 180 miles.<sup>36</sup>  Taipei
is developing the 80-mile-range<I> Green Bee</I> tactical missile
and the 600-mile-range <I>Sky Horse</I> missile.
<P>
<b>MISSILE DEFENSES BENEFIT ASIANS AND AMERICANS</b>
<P>
Missile defense systems will increase the security of American
forces deployed abroad. At the same time, they can benefit the
United States and its Asian allies in other ways. For example:
<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Anti-missile systems offer a deterrent far less threatening
than nuclear weapons.</B>
<P>
Anti-missile systems are a less destabilizing way to deter attack
from nuclear missile-armed states.  Should a non-nuclear Asian
state build nuclear weapons, other non-nuclear states will be
inclined to follow suit. This is a recipe for further proliferation.
<P>
<LI><B>Anti-missile defenses reduce vulnerability to nuclear blackmail.</B>
<P>
China's July missile tests were intended to threaten Taiwan. With
appropriate anti-missile systems, Taiwan would not be as vulnerable
to future Chinese threats. Moreover, with adequate defenses, South
Korea and Japan could better withstand potential North Korean
or Chinese demands backed by nuclear missile threats.
<P>
<LI><B>Missile defenses are insurance against accidental nuclear
missile launches.</B>
<P>
China is undergoing a near-term leadership transition in which
the military could emerge as a nationalist force. Because political
stability cannot be assured, concerns that the political leadership
may lose control of China's nuclear weapons cannot be dismissed.<sup>38</sup>
 Control of some of China's nuclear weapons may have been contested
in 1967, as reports indicate that the commander of the Chinese
military region containing the Lop Nor nuclear test facilities
rebelled briefly against Mao Tse-tung.<sup>39</sup>  In North Korea, presumed
leader Kim Jong-Il's intentions toward South Korea remain unclear,
while accurate knowledge of his health and mental stability is
lacking. Were he to be replaced by a faction bent on heightening
tensions with South Korea, the chances of an accidental missile
launch would grow.
<P>
<LI><B>Cooperation in missile defenses can build political confidence
in Asia.</B>
<P>
As missile defenses are non-threatening and reduce threats to
Asian population centers, multilateral efforts led by the United
States can enhance security, promote defense cooperation, and
advance U.S. leadership with Asian allies and friends. These measures
would decrease mistrust and increase confidence between Asian
countries.
<P>
<LI><B>Missile defenses can create incentives to reduce both nuclear
weapons and ballistic missiles.</B>
<P>
For example, if both India and Pakistan possessed missile defenses,
there would be less incentive to launch missile attacks against
each other. A reduction in the utility of nuclear missiles could
enhance mutual confidence, opening the door to negotiations on
limiting and reducing nuclear and missile forces. Similarly, if
the ROC possessed adequate missile defenses, Taipei would have
a greater incentive to propose confidence-building measures with
Beijing. It could ask, for example, that Beijing join it in agreeing
not to deploy tactical or intermediate-range missiles within a
threatening proximity. If the U.S. and its Asian allies were to
create a regional missile defense system, they would have greater
credibility in approaching China, perhaps in the ASEAN Regional
Forum, about beginning a dialogue on shared missile defense systems.
This could serve as an incentive for Beijing to limit its short-range
and intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
<P></OL>
<b>MISSILE DEFENSES WILL STRENGTHEN ASIAN SECURITY</b>
<P>
American extended deterrence and forward deployment of conventional
forces serve as the foundation for Asian security. In order to
strengthen deterrence and security in Asia, the United States
must take the lead in dealing with Asia's emerging next threat:
 the proliferation of nuclear-armed missiles. The United States
is the only country with the technical and moral strength to counter
the growing missile threat in Asia.
<P>
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger in 1985 invited Australia,
Japan, and South Korea to participate in the Strategic Defense
Initiative.<sup>40</sup>  Only Japan responded positively, allowing private
companies in 1987 to participate in missile defense architecture
studies with the U.S. Department of Defense. The Clinton Administration
has built on this by seeking Japanese technological contributions
to missile defense systems more aggressively and by offering Theater
Missile Defense (TMD) systems on a commercial basis.
<P>
But the Administration's Asian missile defense architecture is
hobbled by its decision to abandon the Bush Administration's more
ambitious Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS) program.
The Clinton Administration is limiting the U.S. missile defense
program to theater-based, short-range systems. The Administration
refuses to build space-based missile defense systems, like boost-phase
interceptors, that have a better chance of defending the United
States and its allies from missile attack. An active missile defense
strategy toward Asia can strengthen U.S. leadership by:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Creating a major post-Cold War mission for the Asian-American
alliance system. </B>Building a regional missile defense architecture
is a service that only America can provide. A secure and stable
Asia will foster growth in job-creating U.S.-Asia trade. Equally
important, by cooperating with Washington to develop and fund
missile defenses, Asian nations for the first time will be able
to share the burden of defending the United States and other countries
from nuclear missile threats.
<P>
<LI><B>Confirming the benign and defensive intent of American strategy
in Asia. </B>American leadership in missile defenses would offer
allied and friendly Asian states the same protection from limited
nuclear attack or nuclear blackmail that  Americans enjoy. Such
defenses threaten only the offensive weapons of potential aggressor
states in Asia.
<P>
<LI><B>Reversing the growing impression in Asia of American retreat
and weak leadership. </B>
<P>
The Clinton Administration's policy flip-flops toward China, attempts
to manage trade with Japan, and inaction in response to aggressive
acts by China in the South China Sea and against Taiwan have reduced
American credibility in Asia. By exercising strong leadership
in missile defenses, Washington can regain lost political momentum
and begin to reverse diplomatic damage. A strategy to accomplish
this goal would entail:
<P>
<OL>
<LI><b>Building and deploying a missile defense system for the United
States.</b>
<P>
A National Missile Defense (NMD) system is needed not only to
defend Americans, but to demonstrate to U.S. allies and friends
that they too need not be vulnerable to nuclear attack or blackmail.
Such a goal is both feasible and affordable. Earlier this year,
a team of experts assembled by The Heritage Foundation recommended
a National Missile Defense system based initially on the Navy's
Upper Tier proposal. This is an advanced high-velocity version
of the Navy's <I>Standard</I> surface-to-air missile system deployed
in AEGIS cruisers and destroyers. Its guidance would be assisted
by the <I>Brilliant Eyes</I> early warning and tracking satellite.
The Heritage plan then calls for Upper Tier to be supplemented
by space-based defenses, to include space-based missile interceptors
and lasers. The cost of the Upper Tier, <i>Brilliant Eyes,</i> and space
based systems is estimated to be about $25 billion over 15 years.<sup>41</sup>
 At the same time, it is critical that the U.S. retain adequate
offensive nuclear systems, although NMD would allow the U.S. to
reduce its nuclear deterrent forces.<sup>42</sup>
<P>
Space-based missile defense systems also would enable the U.S.
to complement any future TMD capabilities of its Asian allies.
If U.S. space-based interceptors or lasers did not destroy hostile
missiles early in their flight, U.S. satellites could help direct
Asian-based interceptors to their targets. Some countries in Asia,
like Australia, oppose a U.S. National Missile Defense program
because it might lead to abrogating the 1973 Anti-Ballistic Missile
(ABM) Treaty. Washington should tell its friends that it seeks
ultimately to renegotiate the ABM Treaty with Russia to allow
for a limited national defense against missiles but that, in the
meantime, the ABM Treaty does not prohibit the United States from
deploying theater missile defenses in Asia.
<P>
<LI><b>Accelerating development and deployment of the Navy's Upper
Tier TMD system to the Pacific Fleet and the Army's THAAD TMD
system to U.S. forces in South Korea and Japan.</b>
<P>
The Clinton Administration should increase funding for the Navy's
Upper Tier TMD system, THAAD, and the Brilliant Eyes early warning
satellite. These TMD systems are needed urgently to defend U.S.
naval and ground forces in Asia.<sup>43</sup>  The Navy's Upper Tier system
is especially important because its mobility will enable the U.S.
Pacific Command to deploy a TMD system near South Korea or Taiwan.
This system also will protect U.S. naval forces within range of
Chinese medium-range missiles. The THAAD system is needed to defend
U.S. forces in South Korea and Japan against North Korean Scud
 and <I>Nodong </I> missiles. Accelerated development of Upper
Tier and THAAD would make these systems more rapidly available
for sale to U.S. allies.
<P>
<LI><b>Encouraging Japan, South Korea, and Australia to acquire advanced
U.S. TMD systems and promote multilateral missile defense cooperation.</b>
<P>
Washington should urge its major allies in Asia to purchase TMD
systems, enter into co-development programs, and then explore
multilateral cooperation in missile defense activities. Japan
is slowly developing a political consensus to purchase an advanced
U.S.-based TMD system. According to a recent study of potential
missile defense architectures for Japan, completed by private
U.S. and Japanese companies, a Japanese TMD system could include
advanced Patriot, THAAD, and naval-based Upper Tier systems guided
by missile targeting systems built into AWACS radar aircraft.
Washington should urge Tokyo to decide quickly on missile defense
architecture and to purchase those systems from the United States.
<P>
South Korea has a clear requirement to defend itself against North
Korean missiles. Therefore, it is interested in obtaining TMD
systems. Washington should urge Seoul to place a much higher priority
on purchasing TMD systems from the U.S. South Korea now relies
on the approximately 192 Patriot  missiles deployed in the Spring
of 1994, which mainly protect U.S. forces in South Korea and are
not enough to defend ROK forces or cities.<sup>44</sup>
<P>
Australia, which refused to join the 1985 U.S. offer of SDI international
cooperation, finally signed a missile defense research agreement
with the U.S. in June 1995.<sup>45</sup>  During the Gulf War, a jointly manned
early warning satellite downlink in Nurrungar, Australia, helped
target attacking Iraqi Scud  missiles. The U.S. should encourage
Australia to consider purchasing naval-based Upper Tier systems
and placing them in air defense frigates which Australia plans
to build. Washington should ask Canberra to consider hosting a
multinational missile defense early warning observation facility
at Nurrungar. The facility would be open to Western allies cooperating
in missile defense and to other states seeking neutral enforcement
mechanisms for missile control or reduction agreements.
<P>
Washington also should encourage missile defense cooperation between
South Korea and Japan. The major reason for this is to help South
Korea avoid any unintended damage from Chinese or North Korean
missiles destroyed on their way to Japan. When the Upper Tier
AEGIS cruisers are introduced to the 7th Fleet, the U.S. Navy
should demonstrate their capability to allies and friends in Southeast
Asia and make their use a regular part of multilateral exercises,
like <I>KANGAROO</I> in Australia and <I>RIMPAC,</I> conducted
bi-annually with most U.S. allies and friends in Asia.
<P>
<LI><b>Telling China to live up to its nonproliferation commitments
and offering to share missile defense technology if China agrees
to verifiable nuclear missile limitation.</b>
<P>
Washington should continue to urge Beijing to abide fully by the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and to join the Missile Technology
Control Regime. Washington also should urge Beijing to make its
nuclear weapons programs more transparent and to consider eventual
limitations on its nuclear arsenal. But added pressure on China
is needed. The Chinese should be told that if they do not curb
nuclear technology cooperation with countries like Pakistan and
Iran, and missile sales to Pakistan, China will begin to define
itself as an adversary.
<P>
The Clinton Administration should obey the 1990 Arms Export Control
Act that obligates the United States to impose trade sanctions
on China because of its sale of missiles to Pakistan. U.S. intelligence
agencies believe China has shipped over 30 M-11 missiles to Pakistan.
This charge cannot be swept under the rug. Failure to respond
to China's sale of missiles makes a mockery of the Administration's
nonproliferation policies. The Clinton Administration should devise
a graduated schedule of sanctions that will be ended when China
joins the MTCR.
<P>
Clinton should also explain to the Chinese that missile defenses
are a justified and moral response to China's continued nuclear
weapons buildup and its demonstrated willingness to engage in
nuclear threats. Washington should tell Beijing that if it agrees
to talks aimed at verifiable limits on its nuclear arsenal, the
U.S. will make available to China early warning data.
<P>
<LI><b>Selling advanced TMD systems to Taiwan, consistent with the
Taiwan Relations Act, and preparing U.S. naval TMD forces to help
defend Taiwan.</b>
<P>
The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) calls for the U.S. to &quot;provide
Taiwan with arms of a defensive character&quot; and to &quot;maintain
the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force
or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security,
or the social economic system of the people of Taiwan.&quot; 
Following China's missile &quot;tests&quot; designed to threaten
Taiwan, sale of missile defense systems to Taiwan is consistent
with the TRA. Raytheon Company is helping Taiwan build a variant
of the Patriot PAC-2 called the Modified Air Defense System.<sup>46</sup> 
Since this program does not respond to Taiwan's immediate defense
needs, Washington should offer Taipei the more capable <I>Patriot</I>
 PAC-2 GEM  the most advanced variant in the U.S. Army  and consider
offering THAAD if Beijing persists in threatening Taipei. Washington
should make clear to Beijing that the sale of missile defense
systems to Taiwan does not threaten China. Rather, the purpose
is to prevent China's nuclear blackmail of Taiwan. Washington
also should prepare to use 7th Fleet AEGIS cruisers and destroyers
armed with the Standard Upper Tier TMD missiles to defend Taiwan,
consistent with the TRA.
<P>
<LI><b>Offering India and Pakistan a deal:  If they agree to negotiate
verifiable limits and reductions of their nuclear and missile
forces, the U.S. will offer them access to satellite intelligence
to verify agreements and technology to help defend against missile
attack.</b>
<P>
To advance non-proliferation initiatives between India and Pakistan,
the United States should offer both countries missile defenses
and technology if they agree to limit and reduce their nuclear
and missile arsenals. A verifiable treaty to limit such systems
might be facilitated by giving Indian and Pakistani officials
access to a U.S. monitor that receives data from U.S. early warning
and reconnaissance satellites or a similar monitor placed in another
location. A monitor would enable both countries to observe each
other's military sites and provide warning of a first strike.
The agreement could be strengthened later by the sale of ground-based
TMD systems to both countries. After acquiring space-based missile
defense systems, the U.S. might help enforce an Indian-Pakistan
nuclear and missile reduction treaty by extending space-based
missile defense coverage to both countries. Space-based defenses
also could give Washington the option to intervene unilaterally
to prevent a disastrous nuclear exchange.

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
The United States must develop a missile defense strategy for
Asia. Missile defenses are needed to enhance the security of U.S.
military forces in Asia, to safeguard America's Asian friends
and allies, and to encourage multilateral missile defense cooperation.
This strategy is sorely needed to enable Americans and Asians
to reduce their vulnerability to Chinese and future North Korean
nuclear missiles. Both countries have demonstrated they are prepared
to disregard conventions like the NPT and MTCR. China's willingness
to use missiles to intimidate neighbors like Taiwan, in addition
to concerns about instability in China or North Korea, compels
Americans and Asians to plan jointly for appropriate missile defenses.
<P>
Only the United States has the technical capability and the moral
vision to prevent its allies from falling victim to nuclear blackmail
or engaging in destabilizing nuclear proliferation. By responding
to the threat of nuclear missiles in Asia, the U.S. can counter
perhaps the most critical emerging threat to peace in that region.
At the same time, by demonstrating determination to counter this
threat, Washington will be strengthening its extended nuclear
and conventional deterrent in Asia while lessening the possibility
that Asia could become destabilized by nuclear proliferation.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Buoyed by the dramatic outcome of the 1994 elections, conservatives had high expectations for the incoming Congress. For the first time in 40 years, conservatives assumed key leadership roles in both chambers. Particularly encouraging were the members of the incoming House freshman class, many of whom had based their successful campaigns on the Contract With America and its bold commitment to reforming Congress and reducing the size and scope of government.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although President Clinton repeatedly has vetoed major legislation, conservatives have achieved amazing success in transforming government and the way Congress does business. Despite setbacks and retreats, the 104th Congress has met the high expectations of conservatives in several key areas by beginning a revolutionary reversal of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture, and regulation.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The successes of the 104th Congress are particularly significant when measured against the records of previous Congresses. While this Congress adopted significant government reforms with only narrow majorities, the New Deal and Great Society Congresses had large liberal majorities. Moreover, the legislation passed by those lawmakers was championed and signed by liberal Presidents. Although the revolution remains to be completed, conservatives should appreciate the progress that has been made.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No assessment of the 104th Congress would be complete without a recognition of what could have been accomplished if the President had not vetoed critical legislation. The most important accomplishment of this Congress was a balanced budget bill which would have eliminated the deficit by the year 2002 while mandating $245 billion in critical tax reductions. American families would have benefited from a $500 per child tax credit.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This legislation not only represented the first balanced budget in 26 years, but also contained significant reforms in government programs which would have returned power to states and communities. In spite of the President's obstructionism, however, Congress succeeded in reducing discretionary spending for the first time since 1969. As submitted, the President's FY 1996 budget would have raised the deficit to $211 billion; Congress deserves the taxpayer's credit for cutting the Administration's projected deficit nearly in half.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the most notable achievement of the 104th Congress was its overhaul of the nation's welfare system. While the President twice vetoed welfare reform bills, he indicated that he would sign a third which differed from the first two bills only in minor respects. This historic legislation ends the federal entitlement to welfare, contains real work requirements and time limits, and fights illegitimacy. President Clinton promised to "end welfare as we know it."  But it was conservatives in Congress who made this promise a reality. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In many other areas, Congress succeeded in adopting conservative, commonsense alternatives to liberal approaches advanced by the Clinton Administration and its allies on Capitol Hill. Congress restored funding for important national security programs that were slashed by the Administration and its allies in Congress. Lawmakers deregulated telecommunications, stemmed the tide of costly new mandates, and stopped unjustified new regulations. Congress delivered on its promise to enact specific measures to improve federal crime-fighting efforts and help state and local officials combat violent crime. In addition, the 104th Congress gave the President the line-item veto.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Conservatives in the last Congress stopped the Clinton health care bill that would have led to socialized medicine; this Congress passed a scaled-down version of health care reform that had as its primary goal enhancing portability of health insurance. However, Congress did not address the flawed tax treatment of employment-based health insurance that produces costly distortions in the health care market, undermines consumer choice, and restricts access to health insurance.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In spite of its success in other areas, Congress has more work to do to complete work on other conservative objectives. Lawmakers failed to pass legislation to end racial preferences. They were unable to end government funding for left-wing political activities. They failed to close down the Energy, Education, Commerce, or Housing Departments. The National Endowment for the Arts and the Legal Services Corporation live on. But Congress did achieve cuts in all of these programs that were unthinkable before 1994.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It took 60 years to build the modern welfare state, and it will take more than just two years to do what is needed to reform it. The 104th Congress, however, has taken significant steps to reduce the size of the federal government and to empower states, local communities, and individuals. President Clinton has stated that "the era of big government is over."  The 104th Congress actually has done something to turn this rhetoric into reality.

<a href="/heritage/issues96/bud_2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Comparing of Deficit Reduction Plans
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After nearly 18 months of trying to block congressional efforts to enact a seven-year plan to balance the federal budget, President Bill Clinton is now jumping to take credit for the recent news that the FY 1996 deficit will fall to $117 billion -- some $29 billion below the Office of Management and Budget's March estimate and the lowest dollar level since 1981. But not only is the falling deficit none of Clinton's doing; the record shows that he repeatedly blocked Congress's efforts to enact an honest long-term plan to balance the federal budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's claim is especially surprising when one considers that in February 1995, he submitted an FY 1996 budget to Congress that would have raised the deficit to $211 billion, or $94 billion higher than is now expected.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is Congress that deserves taxpayers' credit for cutting Clinton's proposed $211 billion FY 1996 deficit nearly in half. This happened because Congress rejected Clinton's plan and acted to curb spending. According to Congressional Budget Office predictions, the Clinton policies would have perpetuated $200 billion-plus deficits well into the next century. Furthermore, had Clinton not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which included $17 billion in entitlement savings for FY 1996, this year's deficit actually would be less than $100 billion rather than the $117 billion for which Clinton now claims credit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But this has been the White House's pattern throughout the budget battle with Congress: First block congressional initiatives, then claim credit for the good news. Since Clinton sent his budget-busting FY 1996 budget to Capitol Hill, he has proposed seven "balanced budget plans."  Each of these plans -- including Clinton's FY 1997 budget -- proposed higher spending and higher taxes, and as a result, each would have added more to the national debt than the balanced budget plans produced by Congress.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There are a variety of reasons the deficit is now $173 billion lower than its peak of $290 billion in 1992. Clinton policies, however, generally are not among them. Some of the factors:<ul>

<p><li><b>Domestic discretionary cutbacks pushed by Congress.</b> Although Clinton blocked the entitlement reforms embodied in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Congress was able to reverse the growth of discretionary -- or annually appropriated -- spending. Thanks to congressional pressure for program terminations and major cuts, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969.<sup>1</sup>  More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. Many other programs, such as the National Endowment for the Arts, the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the Legal Services Corporation, were cut by more than one-third.

<p><li><b>The turnaround in the savings and loan program.</b> A significant contributor to the soaring deficits under George Bush was the high taxpayer cost of bailing out failed savings and loan institutions. In FY 1991, for example, $66 billion in taxpayer-financed bailout costs was added to the federal deficit. In FY 1992, these costs totaled $2.6 billion. This year, however, this program is expected to bring in over $15 billion in new revenue to the Treasury as assets acquired during the bailout are sold to the private sector. Between FY 1992 and FY 1996, this budgetary reversal (from a program adding to the deficit to one reducing the deficit by generating revenues) amounts to an $18 billion swing in the deficit -- 10 percent of the deficit change between FY 1992 and FY 1996.

<p><li><b>New revenues from selling the electromagnetic spectrum.</b> The White House currently estimates that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction of telecommunications spectrum to private industry will generate over $10 billion in new revenues in FY 1996. These new revenues are considered "offsetting collections."  This means they are subtracted from the expenditures column of the federal register rather than added to the tax revenue column, thus giving the appearance that federal spending is lower than it actually is. In 1992, when the deficit reached its record level, the government did not auction telecommunications spectrum; it simply gave it away at no cost, and therefore at no benefit to the Treasury. Clinton is reaping this windfall.

<p><li><b>Defense cutbacks.</b> The White House now estimates the government will spend roughly $266 billion on national defense in FY 1996 -- $37 billion less than in FY 1992. These cutbacks, initiated by the Bush Administration, reflect the fall of the Soviet Union. Under the Clinton Administration, defense spending has fallen to roughly 3.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and less than 17 percent of overall federal spending. Both levels are lower than at any point since before World War II. By contrast, when the young Bill Clinton had his picture taken with President John F. Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden, defense consumed 50 percent of all federal spending and about 10 percent of the nation's economy.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Combined, the last three items alone account for $65 billion, or 38 percent, of the overall drop in the deficit since 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>A Tax Revenue Windfall.</b> OMB currently projects that tax revenues will total $1.453 trillion in FY 1996, nearly $27 billion higher than was estimated in March. It appears that these new tax collections are a one-time windfall rather than a sign of improved economic conditions. According to OMB, "the Administration believes that most of this increase comes from higher-than-anticipated collections of non-withheld individual income taxes."  In other words, it is possible that this windfall is the result of investors cashing in on capital gains because of the rise in the stock market and the possibility of an agreement between Congress and the White House on a cut in the capital gains tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The rise in tax collections from the doldrums of the Bush recession is a significant factor in the declining deficit. Since 1992, tax revenues have grown by $363 billion, or one-third. During the Bush recession, however, tax revenues grew an average of only 3.8 percent per year, half the average annual growth rate between 1948 and 1996. The combined effect of tax collections returning to their historic year-over-year growth rates and Congress keeping federal spending from growing faster than these new collections has made a significant dent in the deficit picture.
<p>

<b>CLINTON'S RHETORIC VERSUS REALITY<sup>2</sup></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's record throughout the budget debate with Congress stands in stark contrast with his public rhetoric. At every turn during the past 18 months, Clinton stood in the way of smaller government and real long-term deficit reduction. The record is clear:
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #1:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In February 1995, the Clinton Administration responded to the 1994 election results by presenting a status-quo FY 1996 budget to the new Congress. This budget deviated little from "baseline" forecasts which projected $200 billion deficits through the end of the decade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

According to the CBO, the President's February budget would have increased the deficit from an estimated $177 billion in 1995 to $276 billion in 2000. Spending would grow an average of 5 percent per year, some $422 billion in all in just five years. On May 19, 1995, the Senate defeated Clinton's budget plan by a vote of 99 to 0.

On June 13, 1995, after months of criticizing congressional balanced budget efforts while offering no plan of his own, Clinton presented a second budget plan which he claimed balanced the budget in ten years, by FY 2005. This plan, barely 30 pages in length, fared no better than Clinton's first effort under CBO scrutiny. According to CBO, in addition to not balancing the budget, it would have produced $200 billion deficits for at least the next ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Due to revised economic forecasts, the Administration later said that this plan would balance the budget in nine years. However, the CBO maintained that it would never have balanced the budget. Indeed, CBO found less than $400 billion in legitimate deficit reduction in this Clinton offer -- $350 billion short of the total seven-year deficit reduction in the Balanced Budget Act.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #3:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 7, the day Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, he presented yet a third budget plan. The Administration claimed that this plan also would balance the budget in seven years but was more in line with the President's priorities than the one he had vetoed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Once again, CBO found that the Administration's numbers failed to reach a balanced budget by 2002. While this budget plan proposed larger savings from discretionary spending programs and welfare reform compared to the June budget, it also proposed smaller savings in Medicare and Medicaid. In total, Clinton's third budget produced only $385 billion in credible deficit reduction over seven years -- $365 billion short of the savings achieved by the BBA he had vetoed. Moreover, according to the CBO, instead of balancing the budget in FY 2002 as advertised, it would leave a deficit of $115 billion in that year.
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #4:</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


On December 15, after two weeks of negotiations with congressional leaders, Clinton presented a fourth budget plan. But this plan was mostly an iteration of Budget Plan #3 and contained no new policy recommendations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The CBO scored this plan as still $69 billion out of balance in FY 2002. The Administration tried to make up its shortcomings in reducing the deficit by challenging CBO technical and economic estimates. The Administration had been arguing for weeks that CBO's economic assumptions were too conservative and thus required excessively deep spending cuts to balance the budget. In making this argument, the Administration wanted to have it both ways. While claiming that it wanted to balance the budget, it actually wanted to spend more money as the budget was moving toward balance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 18, 1995, the House defeated this plan by a vote of 412 to 0.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #5:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On January 6, 1996, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan. This plan, largely adapted from a proposal by Senate Democrats, was certified by CBO to balance the budget in seven years, at least on paper. Though it mathematically balances the budget in seven years, however, the fifth Clinton budget fell far short of being a credible plan. The reasons: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Most of the heavy lifting of deficit reduction was required in the two years following the end of Clinton's possible second term as President. Indeed, 62 percent of the plan's $583 billion in deficit reduction falls in FY 2001 and FY 2002. For example, the plan called for $102 billion in Medicare savings over seven years, but 63 percent of these savings were to come in the last two years. Similarly, the plan called for $37 billion in discretionary spending cuts beyond the savings needed to achieve a "hard freeze" in these programs, yet 95 percent of these additional savings fell in the last two years of the plan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While the fifth Clinton budget plan called for $87 billion in gross tax cuts ($17 billion in net tax cuts) over seven years, these cuts were sunsetted in FY 2001 -- one year before the budget was to be balanced. This means taxes would have to be raised. Mathematically, such a ploy "boosts" tax revenues by at least $15 billion in FY 2002 and thus requires fewer spending cuts to achieve a balanced budget. The overall size of the tax cut proposal was reduced by the plan's call for $60 billion in new revenue from closing "corporate loopholes."  Some 43 percent of the revenues generated from these tax hikes would be received in FY 2002.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #6:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The sixth Clinton budget was submitted on January 9. This plan moved only slightly beyond the previous plans, modestly increasing the proposed savings from Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform while slightly boosting the size of the tax cuts. Overall, this Clinton plan would produce nearly $160 billion less in budget savings and nearly $70 billion less in deficit reduction than the last congressional offer. Moreover, the White House still avoided the fundamental reforms in Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare needed to achieve budget savings and restructure the programs.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #7</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The seventh Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on January 18. This budget plan was essentially identical to the January 9 plan except that it substantially increased the amount of new revenues it would generate from closing "corporate tax loopholes" and other such devices. Because of these new revenues, the net size of the tax cut would have been reduced to a mere $36 billion over seven years.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #8: The FY 1997 Budget</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Like the seven budget plans that preceded it during the past year, the FY 1997 Clinton budget, presented to Congress February 5, would have forced hard-working Americans to pay higher taxes in exchange for more spending on programs which have become old and obsolete, or which are ripe for termination, privatization, or transfer to state control. Indeed, compared with the FY 1997 budget resolution passed by Congress in May, Clinton's FY 1997 budget would mean nearly $1,500 in higher taxes and $3,500 in higher spending for every household in America over the next six years. Moreover, the Clinton plan ignores the fundamental problems facing the government's major entitlement and welfare programs. Clinton has shirked his responsibility to address, for instance, a Medicare program facing insolvency, a Medicaid program that is bankrupting state budgets, and a welfare system that perpetuates a culture of poverty.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Repeated gimmicks and ploys such as these indicate that the Clinton Administration probably never has been serious about reaching a balanced budget agreement with Congress. At every turn, President Clinton has fought attempts to cut spending -- or even to reduce the growth rate of spending. Incredibly, Clinton now claims credit for reducing the deficit to a 15-year low when, in fact, it would have been lower had he not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995. The truth is that Congress deserves credit for reversing Clinton policies which would have perpetuated a $200 billion deficit into the next century. The record is clear: Bill Clinton prefers keeping money in the hands of Washington bureaucrats to keeping it in the pockets of American taxpayers.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has kept its promise to the American people that it would begin to cut regulatory red tape and return common sense to regulation. It has reduced the size and cost of government and increased the health and well-being of all Americans. But alarmists have done a good job of convincing the American people that exactly the opposite has been true, seizing the moral high ground with rhetoric designed to convince the public that a reformed regulatory system would have disastrous consequences. Nevertheless, this Congress can point to a record of solid reforms and progress toward a more flexible and less burdensome regulatory system that will cost less and achieve the same or higher levels of public health, safety, and environmental protection.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is the reality?  Legislation passed by the 104th Congress and signed into law:
<p>
<ul> 
<li> Repealed the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit that had been on the books since 1974.
<p>
<li> Deregulated two major industries: agriculture and telecommunications. Farmers will now be able to grow what their customers want, not what bureaucrats demand.
<p>
<li> Stemmed the tide of costly new unfunded mandates on states and localities.
<p>
<li> Moved away from "one-size-fits-all" regulations by making it easier for the needs of small businesses to be taken into consideration.
<p>
<li> Established clear goals for agencies to reduce the paperwork burden, which will save Americans as much as 70 million hours of their time (valued at more than $1 billion) this year to use for more productive activities.
<p>
<li> Made itself directly accountable to the public by giving itself the authority to review and stop burdensome, unjustified new regulations developed by federal regulators.
<p>
<li> Forced a review by the Clinton Administration of all existing and proposed federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, Congress:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Passed and sent to the President the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act, which would have required federal regulators to follow a set of rational principles in deciding whether and how to regulate. These include the use of cost-benefit analysis, sound science, and risk assessment, as well as market-based alternatives and performance standards. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed and sent to the President with bipartisan support the Common Sense Liability Reform Act which would have curbed abuses of the legal system by relieving the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed legislation to reduce the existing burdens of the Safe Drinking Water Act, one the largest unfunded environmental mandates. Signed by President Clinton on August 6, 1996, the legislation will give states and localities the flexibility to target their resources more effectively to achieve greater levels of protection.
<p>
<li> Started an important national debate about how to resurrect commonsense regulation. This Congress, for example, introduced proposals to restructure the Superfund program in ways that would encourage faster cleanups, eliminate most of the need for lawyers and the courts, and reduce federal spending while improving public health, safety, and the environment. Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration so far has blocked reform, choosing to leave in place a program in which one-third of the money will continue to go to lawyers and transaction costs while failing to clean up many of the most hazardous waste sites.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Taken together, in just 18 months this Congress has accomplished and initiated the most significant changes in more than 20 years, and has changed the terms of the debate in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulation for decades.

<p>
<b>THE BOLDEST AGENDA IN 20 YEARS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Alarmists did a good job in this first round, convincing the American public that regulatory reform was just another term for the rollback of important public health, safety, and environmental protections. As a result, Congress has not yet seen many of its most ambitious efforts to reform the Superfund program, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, the Food and Drug Administration, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration signed into law. Many in Congress believe they lost the battle to reduce the burden of regulation and cut away the approximately $700 billion in red tape<sup>2</sup> that strangles American businesses and consumers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. In less than two years, the 104th Congress accomplished unprecedented and far-reaching reforms that impose discipline on the federal regulatory decisionmaking process, deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries, and fundamentally change the way the federal government and the American people think about public health, safety, and environmental regulation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Surpassing Reagan.</b> The regulatory agenda of the 104th Congress is the boldest of the past 20 years. The successful enactment of legislation to deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries is comparable to the transportation deregulation successes of the late 1970s.<sup>3</sup>  Although the Reagan Administration had bold intentions to reverse the growth of economic and social regulation, the completed action fell short. Other than modest steps to deregulate the energy and communications industries and a new administrative review process that enjoyed some success in reducing the rate and cost of new rules, for example, the Reagan Administration could not follow through with new versions of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and Superfund, or with FDA or OSHA reform.<sup>4</sup>  Thus, the 104th Congress stands alone in the scope and scale of its reform efforts. Until now, the deregulatory accomplishments of the last 20 years focused on freeing industries to rely on market forces. But the 104th Congress also has taken on for the first time the rapid expansion of major health, safety, and environmental programs which have increased steadily since the 1970s. The costs of these "social" regulations, particularly environmental regulation, has almost tripled over the last 20 years from about $80 billion in 1977 to more than $220 billion in 1995.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress needed to take such bold action because the problems have never been worse. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li> According to <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>, the total cost of government has been estimated at $3.38 trillion, nearly $1 trillion of which results from federal and state regulation. The federal government is responsible for imposing more than $700 billion in regulatory costs each year: more than $2,800 for every man, woman, and child in America. Of the 366 days in 1996, the average American will work 184.6 days for the government. More than 40 of these days will be just to pay for the cost of federal regulations.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li> As the number of regulations has grown, so has the number of federal regulators enforcing these rules. The number of permanent, full-time regulatory staff has increased from 69,946 in 1970 to 128,566 in 1994.<sup>7</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
 And more is not always better. A seminal new study from Harvard University reveals that roughly 60,000 lives are lost every year because of the current command-and-control regulatory system, which squanders billions of dollars on efforts to eliminate risks that are negligible or nonexistent while failing to protect the public from others that are much more serious.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has fought to bring common sense back to the way federal agencies make decisions about whether and how to regulate to improve the environment and public health and safety. Today, federal regulators are no longer giving Americans the highest levels of protection for the billions of dollars they take from taxpayers, consumers, and businesses. By making sure that regulators follow rational principles that tell them to evaluate risks sensibly and consistently, consider the costs and benefits of their actions, and use market-based solutions, policymakers can do an even better job of protecting the environment and public health and safety while spending less and with fewer rules.
<p>
<b>COMMONSENSE REGULATORY REFORMS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In just 18 months, the 104th Congress has put in place a number of important reforms that will provide significant benefits to the economy and the well-being of all Americans.
<p>
<b>The Telecommunications Act of 1996</b><br>
The 104th Congress succeeded in passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-104), signed into law by President Clinton on February 8, 1996. This is the most important industry-wide deregulatory initiative undertaken by Congress in over a decade. The Act removes unnecessary layers of federal rules governing telephone, cable, and broadcasting competition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Act eventually will eliminate restrictions that prohibit competition between local and long-distance companies, as well as cable companies, so that they can offer consumers a full range of communications and entertainment services.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One 1993 study estimated that complete deregulation would help create 3.6 million more jobs by 2003 and pass along savings of roughly $63 billion a year to consumers.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Telecommunications Act does not go quite as far as the more rapid, comprehensive deregulation this study envisioned, comparable gains can still be expected over time as a result of the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Deregulation also will mean the end of the Cable Act of 1992, numerous restrictions on beneficial merger and alliance activity, and many other needless Federal Communications Commission activities.
<p>

<b>The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996</b><br>
The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-127) eliminates federal programs that manipulate production and prices of major crops (wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice) through production subsidies and acreage reduction. This legislation will mean greater freedom and enormous opportunities for rural America. By dismantling much of the restrictive straitjacket on farmers, the new law will free the U.S. economy -- farmers and related businesses -- to take full advantage of the growing global market, which should mean huge economic benefits for Americans. According to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation,<sup>10</sup> the new law will mean that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Farmers will earn an additional $16 billion in net income between 1996 and 2002.
<p>
<li> Suppliers of the inputs used in agricultural production will sell an additional $14.6 billion in products during the same period.
<p>
<li> Taken together, the agriculture community will enjoy a rise of $30.6 billion in income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, the Act establishes an Environmental Quality Improvement Program to provide funds for a cooperative effort with farmers to protect wetlands, using a flexible, incentive-oriented approach while increasing wetland acreage under the conservation program. 
<p>
<b>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</b><br>
In response to the increasingly hostile reaction of states and localities to unchecked and costly federal mandates, Congress in March 1995 enacted the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-4). The Act requires Congress to take into consideration the cost to states, localities, and Indian tribes of new mandates. Federal agencies must assess the impact of new regulations both on state, local, and tribal governments and on the private sector; and the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations is tasked with a review of existing mandates.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One year later, states already feel the relief from new unfunded mandates.<sup>11</sup>  Thanks to this legislation, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is tasked with estimating the costs of these new legislative mandates. Now many Members of Congress can find out the costs of proposed mandates and reduce the cost to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some examples of how these additional consultations and deliberations have resulted in important policy changes that saved hundreds of millions dollars:
<blockquote><p>
<b>Immigration.</b> The benefits of CBO's input were evident in the development of the immigration bill. Originally, the Senate bill required that all drivers' licenses without valid Social Security numbers would be invalid immediately upon the date of enactment of the law. CBO estimated that this would cost from $80 million-$200 million for states that would have to purchase new equipment and make other necessary changes to handle the volume of people who suddenly would need to have new licenses issued. <sup>12</sup> This provision was changed in the final legislation to allow for a six-year phase-in period during which states could renew licenses when they normally would come up for renewal. This dropped the costs to states to around $20 million.
<p>
<b>Agriculture.</b> The House version of the farm bill contained provisions that would require milk sold for fluid uses to contain greater amounts of nonfat solids than currently required and lock in higher fluid milk prices under the archaic Milk Marketing Order System. CBO estimated the direct costs of this provision to dairy processors and manufacturers at somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion annually. The final farm bill did not contain a national higher fluid milk standard, and CBO's estimates were used to help make the case for its elimination.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Health Care.</b> The Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill initially included a provision that would have required insurers to provide the same benefits for mental health coverage as for other illnesses, and the case for dropping this unjustified mandate was greatly facilitated by CBO estimates of the cost. The CBO noted that imposing this mandated benefit on private health insurance would have huge public and private sector costs. It projected that the Senate mandate would impose $423 million in additional costs on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) between 1996 and 2002, rising to $739 million by 2005. If it was applied to Medicare and Medicaid, program outlays would increase by almost $80 billion for Medicare between 1997 and 2000, and by another $35 billion for Medicaid during the same period. CBO also estimated that the premiums for traditional fee-for-service plans would increase by 5.3 percent, while managed care plans would see an increase of 4 percent.<sup>14</sup>  The costly provision was taken out of the bill.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The National Highway System Designation Act (P.L. 104-59)</b> ended a burdensome, costly unfunded mandate requiring states to satisfy a minimum tonnage utilization requirement for asphalt pavement containing recycled rubber on federal-aid projects. According to the CBO, the Federal Highway Administration estimates that states would save up to $1 billion annually in paving costs by not having to comply with the crumb rubber requirements.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Amendments to the 1990 Clean Air Act employee commute option (ECO) program (P.L. 104-70)</b> make the program optional for states if they can undertake alternative methods that will achieve equivalent emissions reductions. While the EPA had estimated the cost of the ECO program at $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion annually,<sup>16</sup> it also called the impact of the program "minuscule" because it proved to be relatively ineffective at achieving emission reductions.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act (P.L. 104-119)</b> exempts waste determined to be non-hazardous under the Clean Water Act or Safe Drinking Water Act from regulation under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, since chemical compounds safe enough to drink presumably are safe enough to bury. Municipal solid waste landfills likewise are exempt from ground water monitoring requirements if they are small (waste disposals of less than 20 tons daily).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Repeal of the federal speed limit.</b> As part of the National Highway system bill that President Clinton signed on November 28, 1995, the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit was repealed unconditionally. Beginning on December 8, 1995, states were able to begin freely adjusting speed limits within their boundaries. Several states immediately took action to raise their limits in response to the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996</b> Small businesses are the engine of economic growth in this country. For small business owners, Washington looms as "public enemy number one." Small businesses want to get government off their backs so they can do what they do best -- create jobs and generate tax revenue -- without the excessive burden of reporting and regulatory compliance.<sup>18</sup>  Regulation also does not affect all businesses equally. "One-size-fits-all" regulations impose the heaviest burden on small and medium-sized businesses because they find it harder to spread the high overhead costs of paperwork, attorney and accountant fees, and staff time needed to negotiate the federal regulatory maze.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In response to the concerns of small business, Congress passed the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-121), which was signed by the President on March 29, 1996. This legislation:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Authorizes judicial enforcement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, which requires agencies to provide information on the impact of their regulations on small businesses and other entities;
<p>
<li> Allows small business to recoup expenses and legal fees incurred when agencies make excessive demands for penalties that cannot be sustained in court;
<p>
<li> Provides for an independent ombudsman to receive confidential complaints from small businesses about their dealings with federal regulators; and
<p>
<li> Requires federal agencies to prepare "Plain English" compliance guides spelling out in easy-to-follow language how small businesses can comply with federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress deserves credit for this modest reform in the face of the Clinton Administration's overwhelming opposition to more fundamental reforms that small businesses desperately need. For example, President Clinton vetoed a number of important regulatory, tax, and legal reforms proposed by the 104th Congress that were important priorities not just for small businesses, but for all businesses so they can promote economic growth and create more jobs. These included environmental and workplace reform, secure property rights, a reform of outdated labor laws, repeal of Davis-Bacon, capital gains tax reduction, estate tax reform, tax equity in health care reform, pension reform, and tort reform.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995</b> More than one-third of the costs of regulation -- about $200 billion -- in 1995 was due to paperwork.<sup>19</sup>  Thus, even a modest reduction in the total paperwork burden imposed on the public can save Americans thousands of hours of time and hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in lost productivity. Most Americans fill out some kind of paperwork, such as federal tax forms or forms to obtain some type of government benefit. Businesses also must maintain a myriad of records to demonstrate compliance with environment, workplace, and other rules.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Intent on easing the burden imposed by the federal government on individuals and businesses, the 104th Congress voted overwhelmingly to pass the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-13), and President Clinton signed it into law on May 22, 1995. The Act further amended and recodified the original Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The new law sets a government-wide paperwork reduction goal of 10 percent in each of the first two years after its enactment, and 5 percent from FY 1998 through FY 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The General Accounting Office (GAO) recently released a report showing that the number of hours of paperwork imposed by the government rose by 500 million in the one-month period immediately before the effective date of the Act, from 6.39 billion hours on August 30, 1995, to 6.90 billion hours on September 30, 1995.<sup>20</sup>  The estimated burden imposed by OSHA rose the most dramatically, from 1.5 million hours to about 208 million hours.<sup>21</sup>  These significant increases were due to the fact that the new law forced agencies to more accurately acknowledge the level of paperwork burden they impose on the public.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The GAO projects that federal agencies are expected to reduce the paperwork burden by about one percent in FY 1996.<sup>22</sup>  For the first time since 1989, Congress has managed to force a decrease of as much as 70 million hours in the government paperwork burden. This is equivalent to allowing 36,350 people now working full-time on paperwork each year to engage in other, more productive activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Congressional Review Act of 1996</b> For too long, federal agencies have blamed Congress for many of the burdensome regulations it has crafted, and often this blame is justified. The 104th Congress now has made itself accountable and responsible to the American public for all regulations. The Congressional Review Act, part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, allows Congress to review each new rule and consider a joint resolution of disapproval to overrule it. Under this Act, no rule may go into effect until it is delivered to Congress for its review. A "rule" is defined very broadly to include all general agency statements that affect the public, including "interpretive" rules, agency "policy statements," "guidelines," and "staff manuals."  Federal agencies will have to report to Congress on each rule, stating whether they have evaluated the costs of the rule relative to the benefits, whether the rule takes private property, and whether it affects the relationship between the federal government and state and local governments. Congress can reject a rule, which would then have to be changed substantially before it could be resubmitted to Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
More reform would have been achieved had President Clinton not vetoed other measures passed by the 104th Congress. Among them:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>The Common Sense Liability Reform Act (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> The Act would have curbed abuses of the legal system. It had strong bipartisan backing in Congress but was vigorously opposed by the trial lawyers -- incidentally, among the largest contributors to Clinton's presidential campaign. Liability reform is desperately needed to reduce the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. Unfortunately, Congress did not have the votes necessary to override Clinton's veto of May 2, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> In September 1993, President Clinton had revised and reissued the regulatory review executive order first issued by President Reagan. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, established a set of principles to guide federal regulators in developing rules and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in reviewing rules. These principles include consideration of costs and benefits and the use of market-based alternatives and performance standards. The Clinton Administration, however, did not appear very committed to making sure the regulatory principles it embodied were being taken into consideration by federal agencies. A review of EPA rulemaking between April 1994 and September 1994 showed that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Of 45 significant rules reviewed by OMB, only six contained a determination that the benefits justified the costs; only three contained a determination of a compelling public need; and only nine considered alternative approaches to regulating. Of the other 177 EPA rules issued during that six-month period but not reviewed by OMB, no rule determined that the benefits justified the costs.<sup>23</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress recognized that for regulatory reform to be truly effective, it must force regulatory agencies to behave differently, and a statutory change was the only way to achieve it. Federal regulators needed to be required to base their decisions on costs, benefits, and actual risks faced by Americans, and they need Congress to give them the roadmap to do it. Congress enacted such legislation as part of a temporary increase in the debt ceiling. But President Clinton vetoed this bill on November 13, 1995.

<p>

<b>THE BAND-AID APPROACH: THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S "REGULATORY REINVENTION INITIATIVES" </b>
<p><blockquote>
<center>	I am going to stop handing down mandates to you and regulating you to death.</center>

<P>
--Bill Clinton, remarks before the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Houston, Texas, June 22, 1992.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Despite campaign promises to cut red tape, the growth of regulation has continued during the Clinton Administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
At the end of 1992, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the annual accumulation of all federal regulations in effect, filled 199 volumes and 128,344 pages. By the end of 1995, the CFR had grown to 205 volumes and 138,186 pages -- almost 10,000 pages of new executive branch rules in just three years.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
To be sure, soon after the 104th Congress took office, the Clinton Administration initiated a number of steps that made it look as if it was really serious about slowing the growth of new rules. For example, on February 21, 1995, the White House directed federal agencies to conduct a review of their existing regulations to determine which should be eliminated and which should be streamlined, updated, overhauled, or otherwise improved.<sup>25</sup>  However, one year later, it is clear the Administration is making no real progress in reducing the overall burden of regulation. For example:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In June 1995, the Administration claimed that agencies had identified over 16,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations that they would be eliminating.<sup>26</sup>  But some of the pages being eliminated are for rules for which the underlying statute has long since been repealed, treaties that no longer exist, and the like. This alone easily could achieve a 10 percent reduction in the CFR without accomplishing any real changes in the way the federal government goes about regulating the public. So while it sounds impressive, it is not. At the same time, the Administration already has added 10,000 pages of new regulations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
While EPA claims to be streamlining various permitting, review, and reporting requirements for a number of programs, the Clinton Administration simultaneously is pushing forward with burdensome regulatory initiatives, such as expanding the universe of sources that must be reported as part of the Toxic Release Inventory. Critics argue that last year's expansion will mean as much as $331 million in compliance costs.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Administration, while asserting that it is committed to sound science, is pursuing federal guidelines on cancer assessment to make it easier to regulate or ban substances despite the lack of sound scientific evidence that they pose any risk. Virtually all scientists who conduct statistical analyses to determine cancer risks -- or any other analyses, for that matter -- use confidence levels to determine the likelihood that their results are accurate. But the EPA proposed new rules this April that would eliminate the current requirement that EPA use confidence levels in doing risk assessments. Under this new rule, EPA would be able to conclude that something is dangerous on the basis of evidence that would fail under any rigorous scientific study.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is consolidating a few rules and eliminating duplicative pages in the Code of Federal Regulations, it also is working on new regulations that will impose over $12 billion in compliance costs on consumers and businesses (indoor air quality and ergonomics) and increase the cost of a home by $1,000 to $5,000 (fall protection).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Clearly, the Clinton Administration's "reinvention" effort does little to curb the rising costs and inefficiencies of regulation. The Administration claims to be reinventing regulation but goes about implementing new burdensome regulations about as fast as it can take old ones off the books.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When the 104th Congress began in January 1995, the federal government's ever-expanding reach into the lives of Americans -- the food they eat, how they use their private property, how they run their businesses -- was a source of great concern to the American people. The 104th Congress has made historic progress toward fundamentally changing how the federal government regulates the lives of all Americans. And it has done so by applying a set of principles: free markets, competition, consideration of costs and benefits, sound science and risk assessment, priority setting, and assigning of property rights.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Clinton Administration will now attempt to take credit for regulatory reform through its "reinvention" efforts, but all it actually has done is try to play "catch-up" by repackaging the same old regulatory system and passing it off as something new. Making it easier for businesses to comply with regulations that were unjustified in the first place or claiming to take away rules while simultaneously adding new ones does not represent true regulatory reform. The American people are too smart for that. In the final analysis, they know that true reform gives them more freedom and incentives to take actions for their own benefit, and that the 104th Congress has delivered on its promise in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulations for decades.

<h3>WHAT THE 104TH CONGRESS DID TO COMBAT CRIME</h3></font>
</b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 104th Congress has delivered on its promise to enact specific measures to improve federal crime-fighting efforts and help state and local officials combat violent crime. Most of these anti-crime measures were initiated by conservative Members of the House of Representatives, based on promises made to the taxpayers in the Contract With America, and later incorporated into bills passed by the Senate. They include a solid program of truth in sentencing for violent criminals, effective death penalty provisions, restrictions on the power of federal judges to put criminals back on the streets, a reordering of federal funding from social programs to law enforcement efforts (including prison construction and police funding), and victim restitution.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two major vehicles for enactment of most of these measures were the comprehensive Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (S. 735), sponsored by former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS), and the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019). While more can be done at the federal level, more also needs to be done by state and local officials who bear the primary responsibility for fighting violent street crime.<sup>2</sup>  Nonetheless, the legislative record of the 104th Congress in combating crime is impressive and far-reaching.<p><b>KEEPING THE BAD GUYS OFF THE STREETS</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first duty of government is to protect the people. As a short-term measure, the most effective way to do this is to put more violent criminals in prison and keep them there. In fulfilling this duty, Congress enacted the following measures into law:
<p>
<b>Violent Criminal Incarceration Act of 1995 (H.R. 667).</b> A major failure of the criminal justice system has been the inability or unwillingness to identify, target, and incarcerate violent criminals for long periods of time. Violent criminals typically serve only one-third of their sentences.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under this new law, states will receive Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants for the construction of prisons on condition that they keep violent criminals locked up for at least 85 percent of their sentences. Already, more than 20 states have adopted such truth-in-sentencing laws,<sup>3</sup> and it is likely that many more will adopt such measures to keep violent criminals behind bars and off the streets.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bill passed the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995; was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019); and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</b> During the past three decades, federal judges have seized control of state and even local prisons, dictating conditions of confinement, promoting more comfortable living conditions for convicts, and releasing inmates as a way to ease overcrowding. Federal judges have been releasing inmates without finding a violation of a specific federal or constitutional right. Over 500 municipalities and 1,200 state prisons have been operating under judicial orders or consent decrees. Under Section 3626 of the 1994 federal crime bill, Congress attempted to stop lenient federal judges from imposing caps on the number of prisoners that can be incarcerated at a particular prison,<sup>4</sup> a judicial practice that has resulted in the release of violent criminals before their terms have been served.<sup>5</sup>  Liberal lawyers and judges quickly found ways to get around this provision.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act, originally sponsored by Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL), closes existing loopholes by imposing tighter restrictions on federal court-ordered prison population caps. It requires a three-judge panel to find that prison crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a prisoner's legal or constitutional rights. Moreover, it requires judges to find that there is no other remedy available before they impose a prison cap. State or local officials responsible for the prosecution or custody of criminals who could be released because of judicially imposed prison caps are granted standing to sue. The Prison Litigation Reform Act also specifies that court-ordered relief from incarceration is to be based on specific violations of a prisoner's constitutional rights and that federal judges must give substantial weight in their decisions to any adverse impact of such relief on public safety or on the operation of the criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure also reduces the burden of frivolous prisoner lawsuits, which include a wide range of often strange and bizarre complaints. Inmate lawsuits are estimated to comprise 25 percent of all civil suits filed in federal courts, and state officials are burdened with responding to them. Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon has compiled a "top ten" list of the most frivolous of these lawsuits, including complaints against officials who do not provide salad bars and brunches on weekends and holidays, officials who do not pay food allowances of $26 a day to inmates traveling from prison to the courthouse, and officials who do not permit male inmates to wear such female apparel as bras, panties, lipstick, and artificial fingernails.<sup>6</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the new law, federal courts are authorized to dismiss frivolous or malicious suits "without hearing."  Moreover, all administrative solutions within the corrections system must be exhausted before a lawsuit can be filed in federal court. The measure also limits the lawyers' fees awarded to successful inmate plaintiffs. In the past, trial lawyers have received as much as $300 per hour for representing prisoners.<sup>7</sup>  Under this Act, fees will be based on an hourly rate no higher than that for other court-appointed counsel, and any monetary damages awarded to a prisoner in a successful suit against state prison authorities must be applied to outstanding restitution owed to the victims of his crimes.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019) and signed into law as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>To disapprove certain sentencing guideline amendments (H.R. 2259/S. 1254).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI), requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission to submit new guidelines imposing higher penalties for crack cocaine than powder cocaine, and higher sentences for "high level" as opposed to "low level" drug trafficking. It rejects previous guidelines that would have lowered penalties for crack cocaine to those for powder cocaine. The law stipulates that new guidelines also should include stiffer penalties for drug traffickers who use a dangerous weapon, possess a firearm, or involve or injure children or other vulnerable individuals when committing an offense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill passed the Senate on September 29, 1995; passed the House of Representatives on October 18, 1995; and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-38.
<p>


<b>MAKING PUNISHMENT SWIFT AND SURE</b><p>
<b>The Alien Deportation Improvement Act of 1995 (H.R. 668).</b> Originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law would expedite deportation procedures for non-resident aliens convicted of serious felonies, as well as bribery, counterfeiting, trafficking in stolen vehicles, perjury or subornation of perjury. It also would permit deportation of a permanent resident alien who has been sentenced to five or more years for an aggravated felony.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure, originally titled the Criminal Alien Deportation Improvements Act of 1995, was passed by the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995, and later incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132).
<p>
<b>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 (H.R. 779).</b> While there is considerable debate over the ethics or wisdom of imposing the death penalty, the empirical evidence indicates that the death penalty in the United States is used sparingly. In 1995, there were 2,976 criminals on death row, but the states have executed 263 criminals since 1973. The abuse of <i>habeas corpus</i>, enabling those on death row to file petition after petition seeking to overturn their sentences or convictions, has been a major weakness of the American criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure reduces delays in carrying out capital sentences while preserving the right of those convicted of capital crimes to present valid claims in federal court. It also imposes time limits for the filing and judicial consideration of petitions; ends the practice of filing multiple petitions except in the rarest instances; requires that state prisoners seeking <i>habeas corpus</I> relief must exhaust all state remedies before bringing action in federal court; and specifies that if a state gives reasonable consideration to the petitioner's claim, the federal judge must deny that claim.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 was passed by the House of Representatives on February 8, 1995; incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as part of Public Law 104-132.
<p>


<b>HELPING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The central congressional approach to law enforcement assistance is the block grant, which allows local law enforcement officials to secure more funds, hire more police personnel, and have even more flexibility in using these monies to combat crime at the local level.
<p>
<b>Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants Act of 1995 (H.R. 728).</b> This measure authorizes federal grants for local law enforcement officers while giving them the flexibility they need to fight crime in ways they deem most appropriate for their communities. Unlike the police funding in the 1994 crime bill, these funds are targeted to communities with high crime rates. $503 million has been appropriated for FY 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill was passed by the House of Representatives on February 14, 1995; incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Anti-Car Theft Improvements Act (H.R. 2803).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, advances the investigation of car theft by setting up the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS). This system, to be managed by the Department of Justice and maintained by the states, is intended to serve as a reliable and accessible body of information on motor vehicle titling for law enforcement officials.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This law was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 20, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public law 104-152.
<p>

<b>JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS</b><p>

<b>Victim Restitution Act of 1995 (H.R. 665).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, requires judges in federal felony cases to order restitution to victims in cases involving violent crimes, offenses against property, or tampering with consumer products, as well as crimes in which an identifiable victim has suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss. The law also authorizes the federal courts to make restitution a condition of probation or parole.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This Act was passed by the House of Representatives on February 7, 1995; passed by the Senate on December 22, 1995, and incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-132.
<p>
<b>Sexual Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995 (H.R. 1240).</b> Sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law imposes strong sentencing guidelines for criminals convicted of creating or trafficking in child pornography and the interstate transportation of children with the intent to use them in such criminal activity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 1240 was passed by the House on April 4, 1995; passed by the Senate on April 6, 1995; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-71.
<p>
<b>Megan's Law (H.R. 2137).</b> Sexually violent criminals often are repeat offenders, and their presence in local communities is an obvious concern for families with children. Under this law, sponsored by Representative Richard Zimmer (R-NJ), criminals convicted of these crimes must register their addresses with state law enforcement officials, and communities will be informed when these offenders move into their neighborhoods.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill was passed by the House of Representatives on May 7, 1996; passed by the Senate on May 9, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-145.
<p>
<b>Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 3525).</b> This new law, sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL), makes it a federal crime to damage religious property or obstruct any person's free exercise of religion where the offense is in, or affects, interstate commerce.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 3525 was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 26, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-155.

<b>PENDING ANTI-CRIME LEGISLATION</b>
<p><b>Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 (H.R. 3814).</b> This bill provides $680 million for prisons and $571 million for block grants to local law enforcement. It passed the House on July 24, 1996, and currently is before a conference of the House and Senate.
<p>
<b>Interstate Stalking Punishment and Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 2980/S. 1729).</b> H.R. 2980 makes it a felony to cross a state line to stalk someone or to cross a state line in violation of a restraining order. The House of Representatives passed this bill on May 7, 1996. S. 1729, an identical bill sponsored by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), was passed by the Senate.
<p>
<b>Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 666).</b> This bill, sponsored by Representative McCollum, would establish an exception to the exclusionary rule, which bars the use at trial of any evidence gathered by police officers in violation of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. The narrow qualification created by this legislation would allow the admission of evidence obtained by police officers who, while they technically violated proper procedure, acted in the "reasonably objective belief" that their actions under the circumstances complied with Fourth Amendment protections. The bill classifies any information obtained pursuant to, or within the scope of, a warrant as evidence obtained in good faith.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The House of Representatives passed this bill on February 8, 1995. It has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
<p>
<b>Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996 (H.R. 3565).</b> This bill, also sponsored by Representative McCollum, would allow federal prosecutors to try violent juvenile offenders as adults. It also includes tough, mandatory sentences for juvenile criminals who use firearms in the commission of a federal violent crime or drug trafficking offense, and authorizes additional funding for juvenile justice programs and grants to states, allowing them greater flexibility in combating the growth of violent juvenile crime. The bill was marked up by the House Judiciary Committee on July 16 and 17, 1996, and referred to the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth, and Families, which approved sections under its jurisdiction.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the United States Senate, John Ashcroft (R-MO) introduced S. 1245, a similar bill. The Subcommittee on Youth Violence of the Senate Judiciary Committee has held hearings on the Ashcroft bill.
<p>
<b>Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996 (S. 1675/H.R. 3456).</b> This bill would enhance the federal effort to track convicted sex offenders. Cosponsored by Senators Phil Gramm (R-TX) and Joseph Biden (D-DE), the legislation would establish a federal tracking system, accessible to the public, to document the location of sex offenders, making it more difficult for these criminals to hide their records when applying for jobs, housing, or youth service programs. A version of the bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Zimmer. Hearings on the bill have been held before the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Judiciary Committee.

<h3>HOW CONGRESS REFORMED THE WELFARE SYSTEM</h3></font></b>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a><sup>1</sup><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>
</center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 104th Congress passed historic welfare reform legislation; and after vetoing two previous versions of welfare reform, President Clinton finally signed the congressional welfare reform bill into law on August 22, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Liberals have long opposed serious welfare reform, arguing that if the federal government continues its traditional practice of offering free handouts, children in particular will be better off, and the social maladies that characterize the life of low-income Americans in many of our urban and rural areas will decline or disappear. The liberal experiment in social policy has been tried and has failed.<sup>2</sup>  No scientific study has ever demonstrated that increasing welfare benefits to low-income persons improves the long-term prospects of the children of those persons. Indeed, children on welfare, compared to children whose families are poor but are not on welfare, do poorly: They do less well in school and earn less. The liberal welfare state has not helped children; it has hurt them.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The congressional legislation reforms the current welfare system in four major ways:
<P>
<b>1. It eliminates perverse financial incentives for state government.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, the major welfare program for unmarried mothers and children established in 1935, has been funded on an entitlement basis. Traditionally, this has meant that the more persons a state enrolls in AFDC, the greater will be the funds received from the federal government. Conversely, if a governor reduces the number of persons on welfare, federal funding to his state is reduced. Clearly, AFDC's entitlement funding structure creates perverse incentives for state government, penalizing states which reduce dependency and rewarding those which allow their welfare caseloads to grow.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new congressional welfare reform legislation eliminates these perverse incentives by creating a new funding system. Under this new system, each state will be given a fixed dollar grant which will be increased gradually from year to year. If a state reduces its AFDC caseload, its federal grant will not be cut. Instead, the state will be permitted to keep any surplus federal funds that are generated by caseload reduction and apply those funds to other efforts to aid the poor. On the other hand, if a state permits its AFDC caseload to grow rapidly, the state -- not the federal government -- will bear the added cost.
<p>
<b>2. It slows the growth of welfare spending.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to claims by liberals in Congress and certain reports in the press, the congressional reform bill will not cut welfare spending. It merely slows the rate of growth in spending. Seven major programs are affected by the legislation:<p><ul>

<li>Aid to Families with Dependent Children;
<li>Food Stamps;
<li>Supplemental Security Income (SSI);
<li>School lunch and other child nutrition programs;
<li>Foster Care;
<li>Social Services Block Grant; and
<li>Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under prior law, aggregate spending in these programs was scheduled to grow by nearly 50 percent over the next seven years (an annual growth rate of roughly 6 percent).  The congressional reform legislation will slow the rate of growth to around 35 percent over seven years (an annual growth rate of roughly 4.5 percent). Thus, the reform will permit future aggregate state spending in these programs to expand faster than the rate of inflation.
<p>
<b>3. It establishes work requirements.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under the new law, welfare no longer will be a one-way handout. The law establishes serious, correctly designed standards for the states and work requirements for welfare recipients; the goal is for states to reduce their caseloads, not to process greater numbers of persons through welfare. Specified percentages of AFDC recipients will be required to take private-sector jobs. If a state is unable to reduce its caseload through placements in the private sector, it will be required to place certain numbers of welfare recipients in community service work in exchange for welfare benefits. When working in a community service job, the welfare recipient must be in a "pay after performance" system: The beneficiary will not receive AFDC benefits until after the community service work has been completed satisfactorily. If the individual fails to work the prescribed number of hours, his welfare benefits will be reduced accordingly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One weakness in the reform legislation is that because of numerous loopholes, the number of recipients who will be required to work is quite low. By 1999, the typical state will be required to have only 18 percent of its AFDC caseload working. The new law, however, is still an improvement over the current system.
<p>
<b>4. It provides incentives to reduce illegitimacy.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the present time, nearly one-third of all American children are born out of wedlock. There is a growing consensus, among liberals and conservatives alike, that the growth in illegitimacy is a social catastrophe for the nation. The collapse of marriage and the rise in out-of-wedlock births encourage welfare dependency as well as crime and many other social problems.<sup>4</sup>  The welfare reform bill contains three provisions to combat illegitimacy. First, it will focus the attention of state governments on the illegitimacy problem by requiring each state to set numerical goals for reducing illegitimacy over the next ten years. Second, it will provide bonus funding to states which reduce illegitimacy without increasing abortion rates. Third, it will create a new program to provide abstinence education, funded at $50 million per year.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While it is not perfect, the congressional welfare reform legislation is a significant step in the right direction. It represents the largest change in federal welfare policy since the initiation of President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty in 1965.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Much more, however, has to be done. Congress must begin the job of rebuilding and revitalizing America's inner-city neighborhoods, promoting moral as well as urban renewal in the nation's most devastated communities and giving hope to millions of Americans trapped in environments whose principal distinguishing characteristics are broken families, crime-ridden communities, and economic and physical deterioration. Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and James Talent (R-MO) have introduced a comprehensive initiative, Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3467:">H.R. 3467</a>).<sup>5</sup>  Their goals are real enterprise zones in urban and rural areas to encourage business opportunities and job creation in the nation's poorest communities; scholarships for poor children to attend the schools of their choice, including religious schools that reinforce traditional moral virtues; a charitable contribution tax credit to any American who makes a contribution to any private charity engaged in providing direct services to the nation's poor; and the elimination of official discrimination against religious or faith-based drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers -- the very programs that most often use public funds for these purposes most effectively.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives in Congress have a full agenda in social policy. Serious welfare reform is only the beginning.

<h3> HOW THE 104TH CONGRESS REFORMED ITSELF</h3></font></b>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/mason.htm">David M. Mason</a><br>
Vice President of Government Relations<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>
</center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Imperial Congress was dethroned in 1994, and conservatives who had railed against an insulated ruling class in Washington had reason to celebrate. The switch in majorities alone deposed decades-tenured House and Senate committee chairmen who had frustrated Ronald Reagan's policy initiatives and hounded his appointees. But the new majority was far more than an ideological mirror image of the old. Beginning with its first day in January 1995, the 104th Congress instituted sweeping reforms of its own internal operations and budget, the legislative process, and congressional relations with the states and the executive branch.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The abuses of the old order were rooted out, not only with new leaders, but with new laws and rules which amount to the most sweeping changes in decades. More important, these changes likely represent an enduring and positive change in the way Americans govern themselves. As a result of reforms enacted in the past two years, future Congresses will be unable to perpetrate many of the abuses practiced by politicians in the past. The new Congress strictly limited gifts and perks, agreed to abide by laws imposed on the private sector, cut its budget and staff, limited its own spending and taxing powers, and agreed to avoid new impositions on state and local governments. By acting voluntarily to curb its own powers and privileges in this way, the 104th Congress has been truly revolutionary.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, the new Congress has received insufficient credit for these achievements. The reasons: They are not widely known to the public, many of the early reforms were forgotten during the political storms of last winter, and procedural reforms take time to bear fruit. Further, many Americans were disappointed that Congress failed, albeit narrowly, to approve the most popular and sweeping reform: term limits. But the blame does not lie with Congress, which advanced term limits farther and faster than nearly any previous constitutional amendment proposal. Votes in the House and Senate have laid the groundwork, making eventual passage of a constitutional amendment highly likely. The real culprit is the Supreme Court, which invalidated state laws imposing term limits on Members of Congress. Had the Court ruled the other way, a constitutional amendment would have been more swift and certain, and some Representatives would have been facing term limits as early as 1998.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Repairing the public's fractured trust in Congress will take a long time, but a simple listing of reforms implemented since January 1995 should cheer Americans who sometimes despair about whether politicians can ever get things right. Among its reform accomplishments, the 104th Congress:<ul>

<p><li>Applied laws imposed on the private sector to itself;

<p><li>Froze congressional pay;

<p><li>Cut its own budget and staff;

<p><li>Granted line-item veto authority to future Presidents;

<p><li>Banned most gifts to Members of Congress;

<p><li>Required lobbyists to register and disclose their activities;

<p><li>Restricted laws imposing burdens on states and communities (unfunded mandates);

<p><li>Reduced franking (free mail) and other perks;

<p><li>Imposed term limits on committee chairmen and top House and Senate leaders;

<p><li>Abolished an entire agency (the Office of Technology Assessment);

<p><li>Privatized support services;

<p><li>Eliminated government grants to nonprofit lobbying groups;

<p><li>Repealed a law that favored congressional staff in hiring for career government jobs; and

<p><li>Established a mechanism for Congress to review major new regulations.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to these reforms applying to the entire Congress, the House of Representatives, which had been subject to more severe criticism for its management and procedures, acted on its own to:
<ul>
<p><li>Require a supermajority (three-fifths) vote to increase taxes;

<p><li>Conduct its first comprehensive audit and modernized financial management;

<p><li>Reform the committee structure, eliminating three full committees and 25 subcommittees;

<p><li>Prohibit absentee (proxy) voting in committees;

<p><li>Open committee meetings and information to the media and the public;

<p><li>Create a new corrections day process to repeal unreasonable rules and regulations;

<p><li>Guarantee that the minority party would have more opportunities to amend legislation; and

<p><li>Compare spending proposals to existing spending (rather than to inflated projections).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The result of these reforms is a Congress that is less costly, less bureaucratic, and less insulated from the concerns of average Americans. It is more open, more responsive, and more accountable to voters. It is, in brief, a Congress more befitting a democratic republic, and unless these reforms are abandoned or reversed, Americans should discover a growing sense of confidence in their ability to govern themselves through Congress.
<p>

<b>THE FIRST DAY</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 104th Congress acted swiftly to change its rules and practices. The 1994 elections changed the partisan control of Congress and delivered a clear reform mandate. The Contract With America promised numerous changes in House rules, and the new leadership of the House of Representatives took this mandate and ran with it. On January 4, 1995, the opening day of the 104th Congress, the House voted to end procedures that had become increasingly arbitrary and secretive.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new House rules package largely achieved the goals of the institution's critics. The rules were designed to:<ul>

<p><li>Improve deliberation by banning proxy (absentee) voting in committees, ensuring minority rights in the amendment process, and requiring fuller reporting on spending bills;

<p><li>Streamline the legislative process by cutting the number of committees and subcommittees, abolishing joint referrals of legislation, and slashing committee staff;

<p><li>Promote accountability by requiring that committee meetings be open to the public and to the broadcast media, requiring roll call votes on major legislation, prohibiting alterations in debate transcripts, and conducting a comprehensive audit of House finances; and

<p><li>Increase responsiveness by imposing term limits on the Speaker and committee chairmen and providing for consideration of a measure to apply federal laws to Congress as the first legislative vote in the 104th Congress.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Republicans' Contract With America provided for eight specific first-day reforms that the House succeeded in passing, in most cases with large bipartisan majorities:
<ol>
<p><li><b>Staff Cuts and Committee Reforms.</b> The new rules package eliminated three House committees (Post Office and Civil Service, District of Columbia, and Merchant Marine and Fisheries) and 25 subcommittees. The committee reform provision also shrank House committee staff by one-third.

<p><li><b>Truth in Budgeting.</b> Appropriations committees are now required to compare new spending recommendations to the current spending level. Under the old system, tax-and-spend liberals had the upper hand because spending increases were judged not against what actually was spent last year, but against projected spending for next year. With these rules, even a spending increase could be called a "cut."

<p><li><b>Term Limits for Committee Chairmen and the Speaker.</b> House committee chairmen will be prohibited from serving more than three consecutive Congresses (six years). Limiting the tenure of committee chairmen begins to address some of the concerns of advocates of full-scale legislative term limits. A central problem of previous Congresses had been that committee chairmen, who set the agenda, had spent decades in office. In the 103rd Congress, for example, the chairmen of two of the House's three most powerful committees (Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce) had held these positions for over a decade; the chairman of the third (Appropriations) had just vacated his position after holding it since the 1970s.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, the Speaker will be prohibited from serving more than four Congresses (eight years), bringing the top constitutional officer of the legislative branch in line with the President, his executive branch counterpart.

<p><li><b>Elimination of Proxy Voting.</b> Elimination of the practice of allowing absent members of a committee to lend their votes to other members was critical to ensuring fairness and improving committee deliberation. Although House rules strictly prohibited one Member from casting votes for another on the House floor (indeed, ethics reprimands have been triggered by violations of this rule), proxy voting was the norm in most committees in the 103rd Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Proxy voting promoted committee absenteeism by ensuring that legislators who skipped meetings would retain their ability to cast votes in absentia, in addition to allowing legislators to abandon their deliberative responsibilities by voting for or against legislation without hearing any discussion or argument on its merits. Abolishing proxy voting will reduce the power of committee chairmen and force Members to show up and actually participate in the work of their committees if they want their votes to count.
<p>
<p><li><b>Open Meetings.</b> The 1995 rules changes also ensure public access to committee meetings. In previous Congresses, committees frequently closed their doors to the press and public, a step the panels could take for nearly any reason. In fact, the two House committees that most often operated in secret (Appropriations and Ways and Means) were the ones making controversial choices about federal taxation and spending.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Further, broadcast media are permitted to cover any open hearing or meeting (previously, media coverage was subject to a vote of approval). The new rules also require that committees publish recorded committee votes in their reports (most voting records previously were available only at committee offices) and that hearing transcripts not be altered other than for minor grammatical changes.

<p><li><b>Tax Hikes More Difficult.</b> The new rules require a three-fifths vote of the House to pass any income tax rate increase and prohibit retroactive taxation of income. The 60 percent rule has been particularly controversial, with some Washington commentators claiming the new rule is anti-democratic or even unconstitutional. Behind the heated rhetoric inside the Beltway is the conviction that new tax increases are needed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The supermajority requirement is similar to restrictions voters have imposed on numerous state legislatures. Among the most beneficial aspects of the 60 percent tax rule is that any future Congress desiring to raise taxes would have to alter or waive the rule, thereby signaling a potential tax boost. The provision also balances the burden of a 1990 budget law which effectively requires a 60 percent vote in the Senate to cut taxes (unless the reductions are offset by increases in other taxes or cuts in entitlement spending).
<p>
<li><b>House Audit.</b> Another 1995 rules change authorized a comprehensive audit of House records, assets, and facilities by an independent accounting firm. Some House accounts previously had been audited sporadically by the General Accounting Office, an internal congressional agency. Despite the fact that one such audit uncovered the House Bank scandal, most House accounts were not examined regularly, and some may never have been reviewed by an independent examiner. This audit -- the first complete accounting of the House's financial status ever made available to the public -- uncovered 14 material weaknesses (significant deficiencies) in House accounting and financial control processes and resulted in a complete overhaul of House financial management practices.

<p><li><b>Applying Federal Laws to Congress.</b> The last of the Contract reforms was the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA). This measure has both substantive and symbolic importance. It underscores the principle that no American should be immune from the law or receive special treatment in its application. The bill also should encourage legislators to review the burdens that federal laws place on American citizens and ensure that the benefits they bring exceed their attendant costs.
</ol>

<p>
<b>EARLY SUCCESSES</b>
<p>

<b>Congressional Accountability Act.</b> After being passed by the House on its first day in session, the Congressional Accountability Act was taken up by the Senate as its first item of business. The Senate added an eleventh law, the Veterans Reemployment and Training Act, to the ten the House had applied to Congress; it also strengthened congressional employees' judicial review and appeal rights. The House quickly approved the Senate changes and sent the bill to President Clinton, who signed it on January 23.
<p>
<b>Unfunded Mandates.</b> The second piece of legislation considered by the Senate bars unfunded federal mandates on state and local governments. This was also an item in the Contract With America, though not on the list of "first-day" reforms. As with the Congressional Accountability Act, the House and Senate speedily passed this legislation, which President Clinton then signed into law.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As the federal government essentially had run out of money over the past decade, Congress increasingly had resorted to laws requiring state or local governments to provide new services. Aside from upsetting the balance of federal powers, this allowed one agency of government (Congress) to expand services while leaving others to raise taxes to pay the bills. This was a sure formula both for expanding government and for increasing voter discontent. The new law requires congressional committees to assess and report the costs of any requirements imposed on states or localities. It also requires the House and Senate to vote explicitly to impose new mandates. As a result of this law, Congress has stopped even considering imposing new unfunded mandates. Rather than trigger scrutiny under the new law, congressional committees have rewritten communications, environmental, and other laws to avoid imposing new costs on state and local governments.
<p>
<b>Senate Reforms.</b> The Senate did not reform its internal procedures to the degree the House did, largely because a bipartisan tradition had allowed incremental reforms to be implemented over a number of years, making a large package unnecessary. The Senate did, however, echo the House by imposing term limits on committee chairmen and on the Majority Leader (the Senate's most influential member). The Senate also cut committee staffs by a substantial 15 percent and worked with the House to devise overall congressional budget cuts.
<p>
<b>Term Limits.</b> The new Congress also held the first-ever House vote on term limits, and provided the first serious consideration in the Senate. On March 29, 1995, as a part of the Contract With America, the House voted 227-204 in favor of a constitutional amendment limiting House and Senate service to 12 years. Though a majority favored term limits, the total was 63 votes short of the two-thirds majority necessary to send a constitutional amendment to the states. In a similar fashion, the Senate voted 58-42 in favor of a "cloture" motion on term limits, like the House, garnering a simple majority, but falling short of two-thirds support.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While supporters of term limits were disappointed by the failure to achieve the two-thirds majorities necessary to send a constitutional amendment to the states, at least members of the House and Senate are on record as publicly supporting or opposing term limits. Supporters now have a standard against which they can measure future Congresses, and voters will know -- unequivocally -- where their representatives stand on this important issue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Supporters of terms limits should remember that a majority in Congress voted for them; the real culprits are not in the majority, but among those Members still opposed, as well as on the U.S. Supreme Court. In a 5-4 decision on May 22, 1995,<sup>1</sup> the Court held that states may not impose term limits on their own representatives in Congress. At the same time, the Court indicated that Congress may not act on its own to impose term limits by statute. The impact of this decision was to invalidate 23 existing term limits laws and make a constitutional amendment essential to achieving term limits for Congress.<p><b>Budget Cuts.</b> The new Congress voted to slash its own budget. The FY 1996 legislative branch appropriations bill provided systemic congressional reforms as important as any yet enacted, including spending cuts, staff cuts, privatization, and abolition of unnecessary offices and functions. The FY 1996 and 1997 congressional budgets reduced spending in real dollars -- not phony "baseline" cuts -- by $161 million, or 9 percent below the 1995 level. Had Congress and the President made similar cuts in every other agency and program, the federal budget would be balanced next year. While cutting every program (including interest payments and Social Security) is clearly unrealistic, it is evident that Congress took its share of cuts and more.
<p>
<b>Pay and Pensions.</b> Members of Congress made personal sacrifices as well, voting in both the 1996 and 1997 appropriations cycles to freeze their own pay. Congress also approved reforms in the bloated congressional pension system. Congressional pensions far exceed most private-sector plans. Congress's pension system is up to twice as generous as those of most Fortune 500 corporations. Not only do these generous pensions burden the taxpayers, but they also promote political careerism by providing incentives for lawmakers to extend their tenure. Unfortunately, the pension reforms approved by Congress were part of the reconciliation package which was vetoed by President Clinton in November 1995.
<p>
<b>Perks.</b> Cuts in congressional perks contributed to budget savings, including a $20 million cut in franking (postage) costs achieved by cutting the budget for each Representative by one-third, bringing down the average annual allowance from $163,000 to $108,000 per office. The House achieved further savings by privatizing food services, mail handling, and other support functions.
<p>
<b>Agencies and Personnel.</b> Congress succeeded in setting an example for the rest of the government by slashing its staff and eliminating unneeded agencies, including the $21 million Office of Technology Assessment, which had provided redundant services to the national legislature. The reforms pushed the General Accounting Office to privatize its administrative functions, such as printing, mail handling, and library services. The GAO also will receive funds to contract out some of its auditing work so that it can benefit from the lower costs available in the private sector. The result is a cut of more than 25 percent in the GAO's budget.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In line with budget savings, Congress cut total employment by over 2,600 positions, nearly 10 percent of the total for Congress and its agencies.
<p>
<b>Lobbying Reform and Gift Ban.</b> In 1995, the House and Senate both enacted rules restricting the types and amounts of gifts lawmakers may receive. The Senate passed a complex rule that allows single gifts up to $50, with a $100 annual limit. Any item less than $10 falls outside the Senate's rules. The House chose to adopt a more sweeping proposal, offered by Speaker Newt Gingrich, to prohibit all gifts. Both the Senate rule and the House ban include exceptions for commemorative items and expenses related to official activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lobbying disclosure legislation was approved by both the House and Senate in late 1995. While this legislation would institute new reporting requirements and close loopholes in the original 1946 Lobby Reform Act, it carefully avoids many potential pitfalls. It protects legitimate grassroots organizing as well as incidental or small lobbying activities.
<p>
<b>Line-Item Veto.</b> Among the most potentially far-reaching reforms approved by the 104th Congress is the line-item veto, which will be available to the President who takes office in January 1997. The removal of presidential impoundment authority (the practice of refusing to spend all the money Congress appropriated) in the 1974 budget reforms was one factor in the continuing stream of high deficits from that year on. Despite partisan differences, the 104th Congress agreed that the President should be able to excise unneeded items from appropriations bills and send them back to Congress. Unless both houses can muster a two-thirds vote to override the President's objections, the spending cuts stand. This is a power used by 43 state governors and, effectively, by Presidents prior to 1974. Ronald Reagan repeatedly asked Congress for just this authority. The 104th Congress's approval of the line-item veto was an act of political magnanimity and unmatched institutional restraint.
<p>

<b>CONTINUING REFORMS</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As impressive as this list of reform accomplishments is, even more impressive is the fact that leaders and members of the 104th Congress remain committed to further reforms. House Speaker Newt Gingrich has vowed that a term limits amendment will be the first item of business for the House in the next Congress. Balanced budget and tax limitation amendments also will be brought back for consideration. Several House and Senate committees are considering changes in the budget process, which probably will be altered in 1997.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Newly installed Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is exploring ways to streamline Senate procedures, and separate Republican and Democratic task forces in the House have issued reports urging further changes in House procedures. These are likely to result in another opening-day package of House rules changes in January 1997. Among the most likely items for action is a Congressional Freedom of Information Act, which would make information about Congress more widely available on the Internet.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Other House rules changes which have widespread support are a truth in testimony proposal to require witnesses testifying before congressional committees to disclose the amount of federal grants and contracts they receive, and a proposal to require sponsors of legislation to cite specific authority from the Constitution to justify it. Following up on the Unfunded Mandates Act, Senator Ted Stevens and others are promoting legislation to enforce the Tenth Amendment and its reservation of powers to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Too often, revolutionaries who seize power become too much like the leaders they overthrew. Some Americans may even fear that this has happened to the 104th Congress. But a review of congressional reform accomplishments over the last two years shows that the reformers stayed true to their cause. They achieved most of their goals (and even exceed some) and remain committed to further political reform in the next Congress.

<h3>
HOW THE 104TH CONGRESS HAS PROTECTED THE NATION'S SECURITY</h3></font></b>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/moore.html">Thomas Moore</a><br>
Deputy Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nowhere has the failure of presidential leadership been more stark and disturbing than in defense and foreign policy. Failures in economic and domestic policy are bad enough. But negligence, complacency, incompetence, and self-delusion in national security are matters of life and death, as the terrorist bombing of the U.S. barracks in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, so tragically attests. When the Commander in Chief is not up to the job, lives are lost and vital national interests are injured.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The President, as Commander in Chief, has the primary constitutional responsibility for the conduct of U.S. foreign and defense policy. But the Framers of the Constitution wisely did not place all the responsibility in the President's hands: The constitutional system of checks and balances assigns much of the responsibility for national security to Congress. Under Article I, Section 8, "The Congress shall have Power to... provide for the common Defence and general welfare of the United States... ," including the power "To declare war... To Raise and support Armies... To provide and maintain a Navy; To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.... "

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress exercises oversight authority for the conduct of foreign and security policy through the authorization and appropriation of funds for executive branch agencies. The Senate also has specific national security responsibilities, both through its power to confirm Administration appointments and officers of the armed services and, most significantly, through its role in approving or disapproving the ratification of treaties, as spelled out in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The 104th Congress has performed with great credit in carrying out these responsibilities, though in some cases the results have not been commensurate with the quality or intensity of the effort. Indeed, there are limits to what Congress can do to protect the nation's security if the Commander in Chief persists in following misguided policies, or is guilty of slipshod execution of sound policies. In any case, the 104th Congress has mitigated the worst consequences of President Clinton's record on national defense and foreign affairs, and has provided balance against Clinton excesses, negligence, and irresponsible actions. Highlights of congressional accomplishments in national security include:
<ul>
<p><li>Making national missile defense a congressional leadership issue. Though the proposed Defend America Act of 1996 has yet to be enacted, it has given supporters of national missile defense the political initiative and has exposed the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the Clinton Administration on the most vital of all defense issues.
<p>


<li>As part of the missile defense effort, focusing attention on the need to withdraw or substantially modify the 1972 ABM Treaty and providing a statutory reminder that substantive changes in the Treaty must be brought before the Senate for advice and consent to ratification.

<p><li> Restoring needed funds to the defense budget to offset the severe, chronic budget shortfall inherent in the Administration's Bottom-Up Review force levels and its five-year defense plan.

<p><li> Allocating substantial new funds to modernize the forces and rebuild combat readiness.

<p><li> Acting to renew the NATO alliance by a series of votes calling for enlargement of the alliance to include newly independent democracies in Central Europe.

<p><li> Cutting foreign aid and instituting organizational reforms in the State Department and in foreign operations accounts to eliminate waste and duplication.
</ul>
<p>
<b>THE CONTRACT WITH AMERICA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration's misguided policies in foreign and defense policy were a prime target of the Contract With America. Alarmed over Clinton's defense budget cuts and failure to move rapidly toward a national missile defense system, Republicans and conservative Democrats committed to the Contract promised to restore America's military strength. And early in the 104th Congress, they worked to fulfill their promise.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

On February 7, 1995, the House of Representatives passed the National Security Revitalization Act (H.R. 7), which sought to establish a commission to eliminate the funding shortfall in defense, set a new policy for the development and deployment of missile defenses, expand NATO membership, and limit the authority of the President to subordinate U.S. troops to United Nations command.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Senate did not take up H.R. 7, but parts of the bill did find their way into different pieces of Senate legislation, such as the defense and foreign relations authorization bills. While not all of the original Contract items were included in final legislation reconciling differences between the House and Senate -- for example, Congress dropped the House demand for a commission to examine U.S. national security strategy -- conservative supporters of the Contract delivered on the majority of their promises to the American people.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress undertook a number of other foreign and defense policy initiatives that complement and supplement the national security planks of the Contract With America. For example, the new majority in Congress has endeavored to:
<p>
<b>Restore America's military strength.</b> Congress approved a defense spending bill that added $7 billion to the defense budget request submitted by President Clinton. This money was needed not only to keep America's armed forces trained and combat ready, but also to maintain a force with modern high-technology weapons in the 21st century. Because he needed congressional support for his Bosnia mission, President Clinton bowed to demands from the Hill and signed the defense appropriations bill for FY 1996, which provided the additional $7 billion above his original defense budget request.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, the President vetoed the accompanying FY 1996 defense authorization bill, which would have 1) provided more funds to maintain the technological superiority of U.S. forces; 2) authorized a pay raise and housing allowance increase for military personnel (including those deployed to Bosnia); and 3) mandated the defense of the U.S. homeland against ballistic missiles. The veto was narrowly upheld, and Congress found it necessary to weaken the missile defense provisions of the bill in order to secure its enactment with the President's signature.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the FY 1997 defense authorization bill, Congress has added more than $11.2 billion to the defense budget and has maintained a vigorous missile defense program -- or at least as vigorous as can be expected under the threat of another veto from a White House which gives lip service to missile defense while steadily undermining any real prospects for deployment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Move the United States closer to a national missile defense system. The FY 1996 defense authorization bill -- approved by Congress but vetoed by the President -- sought to establish a clear timetable for development and deployment of both national and theater missile defenses. Further, it sought to bar the application of Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty restrictions to theater defense systems. However, the President refused to sign the defense bill, giving as his primary reason the strong missile defense provisions it contained. He prevailed, forcing Congress to weaken missile defense in the final 1996 defense authorization bill. Once again, the President succeeded in blocking this country's ability to defend its citizens from nuclear attack, and Congress was not able to muster enough votes to override his veto.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the second session of the 104th Congress, both House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) sponsored the Defend America Act of 1996, which would mandate the development and deployment by a specific date of limited missile defenses of the U.S. homeland. This Act has not yet won approval, but the strong opposition of the Clinton Administration further illustrates the lengths to which the President is prepared to go to ensure the strategic status quo, which defends the 1972 ABM Treaty instead of defending Americans and leaves the U.S. vulnerable to the increasing proliferation of ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction.
<p>

<b>Cut foreign aid.</b> While the new Republican majority promised extensive cuts in foreign aid, little has transpired by way of revamping America's wasteful foreign aid programs. Federal spending on foreign aid will likely be only $2 billion less in FY 1996 than it was in FY 1995. However, under the umbrella of a balanced budget by the year 2002, further cuts are likely. While current cuts amount to nearly 30 percent for all programs except aid to Israel and Egypt, much still needs to be done. One step in the right direction is a new law requiring that the U.S. government report on the progress being made by foreign aid recipients developing free markets, the main engine of economic development. This effort was inspired by The Heritage Foundation's <i>Index of Economic Freedom</i>, a global comparison of economic freedom in 142 countries.
<p>
<b>End the Castro dictatorship in Cuba.</b> Congress passed, and the President signed, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act just a few days after Cuba downed two U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in international waters on February 24, 1996. This legislation, which tightens the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba and allows American citizens to seek compensation for property stolen by Castro, is another step toward hastening the end of Castro's dictatorship.
<p>
<b>Reorganize the State Department.</b> Congress proposed to cut waste in the State Department and foreign operations accounts by consolidating several independent foreign policy agencies within the State Department. This effort, led by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-NC), had the support of Secretary of State Warren Christopher until bureaucratic interests within the Administration persuaded him to oppose it. Key legislation to move the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), Agency for International Development (AID), and other foreign policy agencies into the State Department was approved by a House-Senate conference committee in March 1996. The President has vowed to veto this legislation if it is approved by Congress.
<p>
<b>Express reservations on sending U.S. troops to Bosnia.</b> In December 1995, the House and Senate passed resolutions to support the U.S. troops being deployed on the peacekeeping mission to Bosnia. These resolutions, however, did not endorse the President's decision to deploy them, and also raised questions about the wisdom of American involvement in a mission lacking clear goals. The House went so far as to vote to cut off funds for the Bosnia mission.
<p>
<b>Maintain America's trade relations with China by approving most-favored-nation trade status for China.</b> In June 1996, the Congress sustained most-favored-nation trading status for China. This decision reflects the belief, held by a majority in Congress, that increasing economic interaction is the best way to promote economic reform and advance political liberalization and human rights.
<p>
<b>Protect the U.S. relationship with Taiwan.</b> In the face of Administration resistance to granting Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui a visa to visit his alma mater Cornell University, Congress voted with near unanimity in May 1995 to support his visit. As a result, the President reversed course and granted the visa. Also, both the House and Senate have included provisions in the 1996 State Department authorization bill that would give precedence to the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act over U.S.-China government-to-government communiqu‚s when considering future weapons exports to Taiwan. U.S. China policy too often is framed by communiqu‚s that have no force of law, international or domestic. The Taiwan Relations Act, however, is the law of the land. The President has vowed to veto the bill if approved by Congress.
<p>


<b>UNFINISHED BUSINESS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the 104th Congress has done much to mitigate the Clinton Administration's negative impact on national security, much remains to be done. Working within its constitutional, budget, and oversight prerogatives, Congress needs to adopt a concerted strategy -- and initiate a legislative campaign based on that strategy -- to restore America's lost credibility abroad and dispel doubts around the world about U.S. leadership.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The first step is to continue the good work of the 104th Congress to reverse the neglect and decline of U.S. military strength that has characterized the Clinton Administration. Proper congressional action can encourage the development of a clear and coherent foreign and defense policy grounded in American principles and national interest, replacing the Clinton Administration's politicizing of defense and indifference to foreign policy, which have created only muddle and confusion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress must ensure that the U.S. preserves the capacity to act unilaterally when U.S. interests are threatened. This means rejecting the false notion that U.S. power must be "legitimized" by operating through some international or multilateral agency like the United Nations. Congress must make sure that the Clinton policy of "assertive multilateralism" does not subordinate clear national interests to the U.N. and other supranational entities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress needs to assert its prerogatives to prevent more dubious foreign interventions like Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia which turn the U.S. military into an international social work agency. Clinton's vague global utopianism has misused the military, gotten American soldiers needlessly killed, and wasted scarce defense dollars. If Congress does not intervene properly in such cases, American military strength and credibility will continue to be frittered away in "peace operations" which provide little or no benefit to the nation's security.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress needs to provide adequate funds and resources to preserve the core mission of the armed forces: to fight and win wars in defense of U.S. strategic interests and existing military alliance commitments. Under Clinton, American fighting forces are weaker and less able to deal with larger military contingencies in areas like Korea or the Persian Gulf.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In keeping with this duty, Congress must end the weakening of the armed forces caused by the imposition of a radical social agenda of "political correctness."  The President has imposed his radical vision on the military services by pushing women into combat positions before their effectiveness has been tested or their impact on combat effectiveness honestly evaluated. He has advocated the admission of acknowledged homosexuals into the ranks, contrary to the judgment of the nation's top military leaders. The result has been a corrosion of the mutual trust between leaders and those they lead that is essential to unit cohesion and combat effectiveness. Congress must intervene to protect the morale and combat effectiveness of America's fighting forces.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress must also continue to press for deployment of the most effective theater and national missile defenses possible. If the President and his advisors continue to use the 1972 ABM Treaty as an excuse not to defend Americans from the growing threat of ballistic missiles, Congress should remove the Treaty as the chief impediment to meeting this vital requirement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many in Congress are unnecessarily intimidated by the prospects of dealing with the ABM Treaty. The Constitution establishes treaties duly ratified as part of the "supreme Law of the Land."  But the law of the land consists of the U.S. Constitution; "laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof;" and then "all Treaties... which shall be made under the Authority of the United States" -- <i>in that order</i>. In other words, treaties are not supreme over statute law or provisions of the Constitution itself. Treaties, like the Constitution and other federal laws, are subject to change or amendment. They are not permanently unalterable like the laws of the Medes and the Persians. Congress may overturn the ABM Treaty by a simple statute declaring it null and void.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The mistakes, misjudgments, and missed opportunities that have characterized the Clinton Administration's approach to foreign and defense policy over the past four years are serious. They have weakened U.S. influence and credibility abroad and, unless rectified, could lead inevitably to America's decline as a great power capable of defending its values and interests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For America, it is either lead or be led. The first road leads to freedom, security, and greatness; the second, to weakness and submission. For America's own well-being, and for that of the entire globe, U.S. leadership must be restored. If the Administration cannot or will not provide this leadership, Congress must hold it publicly and politically accountable and then, insofar as the Constitution and good public policy allow, step into the breach to safeguard America's national security.

<hr width=50%></center>
<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Spend a little time in virtually any city in America and you'll see them -- in doorways, under bridges, poking through trash cans, begging for loose change. They are America's homeless. They no longer wear the face of the 55-year-old alcoholic man; they look more and more like young crack addicts, battered women and children, prostitutes, gamblers, and AIDS sufferers. On any given day, about 600,000 people are living either on the streets or in shelters trying to stay alive.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Americans are a compassionate people. But traditional approaches to the problem--promoted through government initiatives and many private charities -- have been so ineffective at treating the fundamental causes of homelessness that we must reconsider what it means to help our neighbors in need.
<p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">M</font>ost homeless programs fail because they protect lifestyles that produce homelessness and neglect the moral and spiritual means to overcome it. </h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Many government programs assume that homelessness is simply the absence of four walls and a roof. Usually it is not: The lack of affordable housing, though a problem, is not why most of these people have no permanent address. Most people in trouble economically have friends and families whose homes they could share temporarily if they choose to. The level of government spending on the problem likewise leaves deeper issues untouched. There are more than 60 separate federal programs that provide some form of help. The federal <a href="http://www.hud.gov/">Department of Housing and Urban Development</a> (HUD) now operates homeless shelters and drug rehabilitation programs in every major city in the United States. But the rates at which the able-bodied homeless graduate to independence from these programs rarely rise above single digits. </td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	America need not settle for this level of failure. If anyone can testify to that, we can.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <a href="http://www.iugm.org">International Union of Gospel Missions</a> -- whose staff members often emerge from the ranks of the formerly homeless -- has been helping the destitute break the cycle of dependence since 1913. Last year, our emergency services and long-term rehabilitation programs helped 14,000 homeless men and women achieve self-sufficiency. These were not "easy" cases. Thousands walked into our doors addicted to alcohol, heroin, crack cocaine, and other drugs. Many have been prostitutes, or veterans who couldn't adjust to civilian life. Many have committed crimes, served time in prison, and failed other rehabilitation programs.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our experience teaches us that America needs nothing less than a reformation in the way we think about homelessness. Many traditional and government-funded approaches fail not for lack of money but for a deficit of vision: They do not treat the whole person. They neglect the familial and moral aspects of a person's life. They refuse to challenge the homeless person's fundamental way of thinking. Says Rev. Mickey Kalman, the executive director of City Rescue Mission in Oklahoma City: "The philosophy of government homeless programs is to respect and protect lifestyles that produce homelessness."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Most significantly, these programs ignore the central dimension of the problem -- the spiritual. After more than 35 years of trying to help homeless people with every imaginable problem, I cannot escape this fact: Men and women who walk away from their jobs, their families, and their homes do so because, fundamentally, they are turning away God and His claim on their lives. But government-funded policies, by definition, must exclude this vital dynamic from the discussion. It is a prescription predestined for failure.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Not only are government approaches not working, but government regulations continue to impede or thwart the most innovative programs. Labor laws, zoning issues, licensing requirements are all getting in the way of private, religiously based efforts to deliver effective care. Authorizing block grants and returning power to the states will not by themselves make much of a difference, because it's state and local governments that throw up some of the most egregious obstacles to our faith-based shelter programs. Moreover, much of government's regulatory itch is aggravated by blindness to the moral and spiritual causes of homelessness.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What follows are some of the dynamics of change: We make sure that these elements are present in all of our 245 rescue missions in the 210 cities in which we operate nationwide. Though our missions offer various educational, job-training, relational, and other skills, these three principles establish an ethical and religious foundation without which all our other efforts would amount to nothing. <p><center><b>The Faith Factor</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is very difficult to overstate the importance of the spiritual aspect of this problem. <i>Spiritual renewal is the fountainhead for personal transformation</i>.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Enoch Walker was married and had a child he loved, a job he enjoyed, and a house in Washington, D.C. Then he began abusing alcohol and drugs, what he calls "the great removers" in his life, because they became more important to him than his family and friends. Soon his wife left him, taking their child. He became so abusive that even his dog left him. He lost his job, smashed his car, and started living on the streets.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Walker went through several rehabilitation programs. He doesn't know the precise number because he doesn't even remember some of them. Yet each time, he slipped back into addiction. "When I was functional, I would put on a nice three-piece suit and go and get the good jobs," he says. "But it was like putting a three-piece suit on a fish. Nothing would happen on the inside."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Then he checked himself into the Gospel Rescue Ministries of Washington, D.C. There, he received not only mental and physical counseling, but something else -- spiritual guidance. As he says, "They reached my heart and . . . gave me an awakening." He has now been clean for three years, and is a self-employed carpenter with two other men working for him.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Walker's story is important because his background is so typical of America's homeless population. Homeless advocates are quick to point out that many of the homeless suffer serious or acute mental illness. They are correct. There are no easy answers for how to help heal these people and restore balance and normality to their lives. Many of them may never leave an institutionalized or group-home setting. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The mentally ill, however, do not make up the majority of the people who walk into our centers. About 80 percent of the homeless who enter the City Mission in Cleveland, for example, show symptoms of substance abuse. At our Mel Trotter Ministries in Grand Rapids, Michigan, perhaps 90 percent struggle with addictions that have helped spawn and sustain a whole set of destructive attitudes and behaviors. There is simply no way to get at those behaviors without first helping the addict break his or her addiction for good. Most government and traditional shelter rehabilitation programs are notoriously poor in curing addictions. Many do not even try.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But those that do suffer from a crucial flaw. Although grounded in the best of intentions, federal programs by law can only administer to mental and physical maladies, not the spiritual. Any homeless programs that receive federal funds "must provide shelter and other eligible activities in a manner free from religious influence," writes Michael Stover, HUD's assistant general counsel for the Rocky Mountain region, in a 1995 legal brief. "It may not provide religiously oriented services to persons using the homeless shelter and must not hire only persons from a particular religious persuasion." There it is: an explicit rejection of faith as the crucial component of change. This is why the overwhelming majority of our mission directors steer clear of government funding.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We've seen countless people wander into our shelters with a mind-wrenching addiction to crack cocaine, for example, and it's obvious to us that it takes more than physical and mental counseling to break that grip. Simply telling that addict to eat his vegetables and study the multiplication tables just isn't enough. Ask any of our mission directors, many of whom have 20 to 30 years experience helping the homeless: The spectrum of addictions and difficulties from which the homeless suffer have no long-term cure outside of a heartfelt commitment of faith. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Skid Row is not a geographical location," says Kalman, a former drug addict. "It's a heart condition. Unless you change a homeless individual's heart -- not just his mind and body -- he will remain homeless."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For this reason, all of our missions instill in homeless people the reality of a God who loves them, cares for them, and wants to help change them. In our view, based not only on our theology but on our experience, it is Jesus Christ, not any program, who transforms a man's or woman's life, who gives them the strength to summon the courage to break their destructive habits.<p><center><b>A Moral Incubator</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Hand in hand with faith commitment is the sustained determination -- both from shelter staff and the homeless themselves -- to stay clean, hold down a job, or save a marriage. <i>The homeless need an environment in which they are challenged to acknowledge and consistently renounce unhealthy behaviors; otherwise, they won't acquire the practical or emotional skills they need to succeed</i>.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mouthing a religious commitment is not enough; there must be actions to match. Our shelters insist not on perfection, but on repeated, good-faith efforts to change. And with God's grace, and a disciplined environment, they do. "We not only place responsibility on our clients," says Rev. Carl Resener, the executive director of the Nashville Union Rescue Mission, "we demand that, as a condition of living at the mission and participating in its programs, these men and women change their destructive habits."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is one reason our shelter programs span several months. It gives the homeless time not only to rid themselves of their addictions, but also to build a foundation of faith, education, and social skills necessary to succeed in life. Consider our Regeneration Program at our Miami Rescue Mission. Rev. Frank Jacobs, the executive director, oversees an eight-month recovery program for 130 men. Bible study is mandatory. The men commit to memory biblical passages--they call them "arsenal verses"--that address behavioral problems such as drunkenness, laziness, and theft. The mission also offers a three- to four-month period of daily instruction on coping and social skills, with a heavy emphasis on relapse prevention.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Listen to Raymond Nastu, a drug addict arrested more than 80 times for offenses ranging from drug possession to brawling. He checked into the Bridgeport Rescue Mission in Connecticut. "I should have been dead so many times I can't keep track of them," he says. But the mission's strict regimen and climate of tough love turned him around. "I never had people care about me the way they do here, and that gave me the hope and courage to believe I could change." Today, Nastu is drug free and works as a carpenter. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now compare that to some of the larger shelters in the country that place virtually no conditions on their residents. The results have not been pretty. Take the Mitch Snyder Shelter, in Washington, D.C. It is named after the homeless activist whose 1983 hunger strike prompted the Reagan administration to renovate a federal building so that it could be used as a homeless shelter. As documented by a <i>60 Minutes</i> expose, this shelter has been a haven for the selling of crack cocaine and liquor, as well as misuse of charitable funds and general corruption.<P><center><b>Friends and Family</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our missions place a heavy emphasis on rebuilding relationships -- to one's family, friends, and religious community. <i>Positive relationships are a vital link between the homeless and lasting rehabilitation</i>.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"We don't always want to put our clients back with their old friends because sometimes the old friends are the problem," says Rev. George Verley of the Union Gospel Mission in St. Paul. "However, the worst thing in the world is for them to be alone, so we teach them to establish relationships. It's vital that they have this support structure when they leave us."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is probably one of the most overlooked elements of most traditional and government-funded shelter programs. The homeless typically are treated in utter isolation; little attempt is made to reconnect them to family members. Yet when caregivers don't know a person's family background, it often becomes much more difficult to discern the most effective ways to help. <p><table>
<tr width=80>
<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Many shelters, fearful of crossing church-state lines, do not even introduce the homeless to religious communities that could offer support. The Salvation Army shelters are a noteworthy exception here, but the majority of shelters have no process for helping a recovering addict plant roots in his or her community.</td><td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">T</font>he Department of  Housing and Urban Development says any shelter receiving federal funds must operate "free from religious influence." </h3><hr width=75></td> </td></tr></table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There may be no more important step for a formerly homeless person, however, than to be grounded in a community of caring, committed individuals. Listen to Enoch Walker again: "If you do not have people surrounding you who care about you and give you unconditional love and give you the time that it takes to work yourself through it and work with you, I do not really see too many people who can make it." The pressures of life, the temptations of the street, the siren call of old habits -- all can easily prove to be too much for the men and women struggling to get back on their feet.<p><center><b>The Government Albatross</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We know that these and other principles are crucial to effectively helping the homeless help themselves. Though we don't expect the people we serve to pay us a dime -- most couldn't -- that doesn't mean we have no expectations of them. "There are two root causes of homelessness," says Rev. Mike Edwards from the Los Angeles Mission. "Lack of relationships and lack of responsibility. Re-establishing a sense of both is key to our long-term success."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Success for us means much more than feeding people and keeping them safe, as important as those objectives are. Our aim is to help people break their addictions, learn basic life skills, and become honest, productive members of their communities. Over the last few years, we've conducted internal studies of our programs and the results are truly encouraging: The vast majority of our missions achieve success rates of more than 50 percent, with many achieving success rates of 70 or 80 percent. That means that most of the people who graduate from one of our programs become independent; a few slip back into old habits, but most remain addiction free, employed, and connected to family and friends.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Our success is also reflected in support from our communities. Eight years ago, the cumulative budgets of the 210 U.S.-based member missions in the International Union of Gospel Missions totaled $50 million. Today, IUGM counts 245 missions as members, and their cumulative budgets add up to more than $300 million. The overwhelming majority of our programs are funded privately, through individual donors, churches, and corporate sponsors. We don't require or expect government to lend a hand -- and it hasn't.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nor do we expect government to get in the way of our efforts -- but it has. There are several areas where government bureaucrats have been unsupportive or downright hostile to rescue ministries' efforts. These include labor laws, zoning issues, licensing, surplus food distribution, and disaster relief. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;v	Most of their objections stem from their reading (misreading, actually) of the First Amendment's religion clauses, designed to ensure citizens' basic religious freedoms. To which we respond: If we want a person to be truly free, that person must first be free of drugs. This is the promise rescue ministry fulfills.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Consider the following trouble areas:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Labor.</b> For years, rescue missions have struggled with the issue of whether homeless men and women who do work in the missions as part of rehabilitation qualify as employees under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/206.html">Fair Labor Standards Act</a>. In September 1990, the Labor Department determined that the <a href="http://w3.salvationarmy.org/saweb/home.htm">Salvation Army</a> had to pay the minimum wage to clients performing work as part of rehabilitation, unless the Army's location registered as a "sheltered workshop." (Sheltered workshops historically have been places handicapped people went for training, not live-in facilities.)<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After much political and legal wrangling, the Labor Department suspended enforcement pending further study. The policy remains in suspension, but has not been formally revoked.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Zoning.</b> City and county boards have stopped or interfered with mission programs across the nation. The Denver Rescue Mission is located in an area known as Lower Downtown or "LoDo." This was formerly Denver's Skid Row, an area where the destitute congregated. In recent years, however, the area has been redeveloped and now supports a burgeoning night life.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	That welcome development has had a most unwelcome side effect: City officials have ratcheted up their efforts to curb the mission's work. For example, on cold nights, the 110-bed mission used to set up about 40 cots in the chapel to meet the increased need. City officials never raised any objection because it took people off the street. Today, city officials flatly prohibit this practice.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;City officials in Daytona Beach, Florida, have not allowed the Daytona Rescue Mission to locate within the city. The mission has gone to federal court. In Albany, New York, the Capital City Rescue Mission has been trying to relocate in order to expand its services. Recently, the city rejected the mission's request to move to a previously agreed-upon property. Other missions that have encountered significant roadblocks include the Union Gospel Missions of Dallas, Spokane, and Yakima, Washington.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Licensing.</b> The licensing of faith-based programs, beyond issues of health and safety, has become a major impediment to many missions' spiritual integrity. Licensing has brought regulations such as a "client's bill of rights" in Tennessee, which originally included the right not to be presented with religious teaching. (That's somewhat like organizing a football team and including the right not to be touched!) <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Then there is the case of the City Mission in Schenectady, New York. It was cited by New York's Department of Social Services because it prohibited pornographic materials from its facilities. Only after three months of negotiation did the mission and state authorities reach agreement that the mission was within its rights to prohibit pornography. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"We determined that on health and safety issues, we would submit to government regulations," says Eivion Williams, the mission's executive director. "But this was an issue of morality -- what was right and what was wrong -- and we stood firm. And in the end, we wound up getting what we asked for."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Food Distribution.</b> For many years, rescue missions accepted federal surplus food and distributed it to the needy without excessive oversight or regulation. In December 1993, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture mailed a memo to missions in its Western region that stated that USDA commodities were not to be used in meals where individuals were required to attend religious services. This caused confusion among many mission directors who were uncertain how to interpret the new rules. On advice of counsel, some missions have turned down USDA commodities because they believe accepting the food would subject them to federal regulations that compromise religious teachings.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Indeed, one of the interesting contradictions of federal policy is that schools, day-care programs, and early childhood development classes operated by churches may serve surplus food -- even though their programs are grounded in religious beliefs. The government seems to believe that children in religious programs need good food, but homeless in religious programs do not.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Tonight 27,000 people in America are staying in rescue missions. Each is being fed, sheltered, and assisted. Last year, rescue missions served more than 28 million meals to the poor and homeless. That's enough to provide a meal to every resident in the state of California. Yet each person is also being challenged with hope and opportunity. Our rehabilitation programs involve over 11,500 men, women, and children. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Rescue missions are poised to continue their dramatic growth and success. Drug rehabilitation programs are expanding to meet the increasing need. Computer training and educational programs are now staples at many missions, providing GED preparation, core curriculum classes, drivers education, and job training. Missions are also setting up joint ventures with local businesses to give reformed addicts on-the-job training. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Unfortunately, our optimism at the progress of our missions is tempered by the cold realities of the street. The face of homelessness in America is changing. It is getting younger and more female. Children, once a rarity at shelters, are showing up with increasing frequency -- and this cannot bode well for American society.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There are other problems. As Rev. Tom Laymon, the executive director of Mel Trotter Ministries in Grand Rapids, observes, "There is an aging population in our prisons that will eventually be given back to society. Many will have spent decades in prison. This means a whole new generation of 'older homeless' will be out on the streets and in need of our services."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Amidst this trend, federal and state homeless and anti-poverty programs -- devoid of moral, spiritual, or religious counseling -- will continue to fail. The answer is not for government to get into the religion business, but, at the very least, to get out of the way of religiously based groups that are making a decisive difference in people's lives.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We have identified more than 100 American cities with populations of over 40,000 that are without a rescue mission. In 10 years, IUGM wants to have programs in each of these. Our hope and prayer is that missions around the country will demonstrate the power of a well-rounded program that nourishes mind and body, spirit and soul.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Rev. Stephen Burger</b> is the executive director of the <a href="http://www.iugm.org">International Union of Gospel Missions</a>. Also contributing to this article were Rev. Mike Edwards of the Los Angeles Mission, Rev. Del Maxfield of the Denver Rescue Mission, and Rev. Lee Schmookler of Goodwill Home and Missions in Newark, New Jersey.

<center><b>"Hey -- I'm Hungry."</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Those involved with rescue missions know the difficulties and dangers of inner-city life. Many, like Mickey Kalman, spent years on the street -- drifting, stealing, begging, and doing drugs -- until they reached out for help. Kalman, now the executive director of City Rescue Mission in Oklahoma City, was invited to speak at the 1996 Republican National Convention, in San Diego.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mickey Kalman's young life centered around alcohol. "I grew up with drunks and learned to drink," he says. He joined a gang. When he wasn't travelling and getting into mischief, he found trouble locally. At one point he pulled a gun on his teacher, threatening to "blow his brains out." By the age of 12, he was on probation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Later Kalman got involved with drugs. "Once I ran away with a shipment of dope, sold it, and hid out in Wyoming," he remembers. "When I didn't have money for gas, I siphoned it out of construction trucks."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One day he found himself in Stockton, California, alone and hungry. He'd been living on the streets for the better part of two years. He walked up to the door of a rescue mission and said, "Hey -- I'm hungry." The man at the mission offered Kalman some food and some work. He didn't usually get offers for work, but he agreed. Kalman decided to enter the rehabilitation program, where he found faith in God and the power to turn his life around.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today, Rev. Mickey Kalman oversees a mission budget of $1.4 million, with a staff of 21. Thousands are helped by his mission every year. "Rescue mission work isn't easy," he says. "It's hard to love some of the people who come to us . . . [but] when they knock, I say, 'Come on in. My name is Mickey Kalman. How would you like to stick around and do a little work?'"

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>The Fresh Start Program (Los Angeles Mission).</b> Fresh Start has become a beacon of hope for addicts on L.A.'s Skid Row. Designed at the Los Angeles Mission, this 12- to 18-month program offers personal counseling, work therapy, a computerized learning center, physical education, and Bible study. Approximately 200 men are enrolled. Graduates of Fresh Start have set up an Alumni Association to assist with the transition back into the community. Over the last four years, 68 percent of graduates have left the streets, have established a residence and gotten involved in a local church, and have gained employment and stayed with that job for at least one year. Cost: $35 per person per day.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>New Life Rehabilitation (Denver Rescue Mission).</b> New Life Rehabilitation is a 6- to 24-month program for approximately 100 men and women. This five-stage program focuses on setting and meeting goals -- personal, educational, and behavioral. To help with the transition to the outside, the mission has a manufacturing business, Harvest Industries, in which recovering addicts earn money assembling musical products for a local corporation, Ultimate Support Systems. For single mothers and children, there is Champa House, which teaches educational and parenting skills while allowing each mother to work through her own personal issues. Cost: Less than $30 per person per day.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Harvest Home (Haven of Rest Ministries in Akron, Ohio).</b> Harvest Home is an emergency shelter for homeless women and children. In addition to food and clothing, it provides a variety of rehabilitative services including computer-enhanced education classes, parenting and life-skills training, individual counseling, expressive art therapy, and Bible study. Roughly 80 percent of Harvest Home's clients are chemically dependent when they arrive. Cost: About $35 per person per day.

national-service program; <a href="#bandow">Doug Bandow</a> says it's hollow at the corps.</h3>

<blockquote><p>
<b>Habitat for Conservative Values<br>by Harris Wofford & Steven Waldman</b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Let's conduct what Charles Murray might call "a thought experiment." Imagine it's 1993 and Newt Gingrich has been sworn in as president. In his Inaugural Address, he pledges to "dismantle the welfare state and replace it with an Opportunity Society." He appoints a task force of the party's most creative conservatives to ensure that citizen action will fill the void left by the withdrawal of government. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There is, by no means, unanimity. The Cato Institute's Doug Bandow argues that as government recedes, charities and volunteer groups will naturally fill the gap. Arianna Huffington says that the nonprofit sector must become more effective and less bureaucratic. Gingrich agrees and advises the task force to look at <a href="http://www.habitat.org/">Habitat for Humanity</a> as a model for truly effective compassion -- inexpensive, nongovernmental, and faith-based. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	From Switzerland, William F. Buckley Jr. faxes in a chapter from his book <I>Gratitude</I> calling for a national-service program to engage young people in solving problems outside of government bureaucracies. Jim Pinkerton urges the re-creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps on a massive scale. Colin Powell reminds the group that the most successful race- and class-mixing program has not been busing or quotas but service in the U.S. Army. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a> argues that all government benefits ought to require something of the beneficiaries in turn, shattering the entitlement mentality created by years of Democrat-created welfare programs. Senator Dan Coats suggests that government's role should be confined to helping local community-based institutions solve their own problems. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The task force decides unanimously that there should be no big federal program, with armies of Washington bureaucrats telling communities what to do. Instead, Washington would give money to states to help local community groups help themselves. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And, inspired by Buckley, the members of the task force hit on an innovative idea. Instead of just giving grants to nonprofit groups, thereby creating nonprofit bureaucracies, they could model it after programs like the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, to which committed young people devote themselves for a year or two of service. The federal government would in turn provide that young person with a "service scholarship." This would, someone points out, establish a principle that the "educrats" in the higher-education lobby have always opposed: financial aid awarded not on need but merit, merit in this case defined as a willingness to serve one's country. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Pollster Frank Luntz tells Gingrich that even though it's a decentralized, community-based program, the young people it engages should be linked together with a national spirit -- and name. Haley Barbour suggests "RepubliCorps" but Gingrich believes that might deprive it of bipartisan support. He asks his advisors to come up with a better name and gives them one bit of advice, "Don't be afraid to make it sound patriotic. Unlike the other party, we are not embarrassed to be Americans." So Luntz has a brainstorm: Let's call it "AmeriCorps." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The reality, of course, is that Bill Clinton thought of <a href="http://www.cns.gov/americorps.html">AmeriCorps</a> first, and most Washington Republicans ended up opposing it as typical Big-Government liberalism. Republicans in Congress are now on the wrong side not only of the politics -- AmeriCorps is popular with voters -- but of their own ideology. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There is, however, a striking difference between the comments of Beltway Republicans and those in the rest of the country. New Hampshire governor Steve Merrill has called AmeriCorps "a great success in the state of New Hampshire." Michigan governor John Engler has said AmeriCorps "captures the promise found in all citizens." Arizona governor Fife Symington said he was "enthusiastic and impressed with the work of AmeriCorps." And Massachusetts governor William Weld called it "one of the most intelligent uses of taxpayer money ever." Let us explain why we think these Republican governors are right. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Readers of <i>Policy Review</i> will not need much persuading that government cannot solve many of our problems. But just as liberals have to be more realistic about the limits of government, conservatives need to be more realistic about the limits of the volunteer sector. One of the most common criticisms of AmeriCorps is that it is not needed in a nation in which 90 million people are volunteering. That is a weak argument. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	First, one-third of the volunteering done by those 90 million Americans consists of serving on committees, baby-sitting, singing in the church choir, or other activities that are beneficial but hardly a substitute for the welfare state. Second, while the potential power of the volunteer sector is awesome, the trend is in the wrong direction. Just as a social consensus against government solutions has begun to emerge, Americans have been volunteering less, according to estimates by the Independent Sector.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As women have moved into the labor market, the composition of the volunteer force has changed. Most people now are free only on weekends or evenings. That limits the types of volunteer work they can perform. Most important, harnessing the power of volunteers is not easy. Volunteers need to be trained, supervised, and deployed well to be effective. As former Michigan governor George Romney said, "There is no free lunch when it comes to volunteering." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some conservatives argue that even if the charitable sector has limits, governmental solutions will only make matters worse. "Paying" AmeriCorps members, the argument goes, subverts the idea of volunteerism -- labor given for love, not money. In an <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/walt.html">article</a> for the January-February 1996 issue of <i>Policy Review</i>, John Walters of the New Citizenship Project argued that AmeriCorps's "very premise -- using federal resources to promote voluntarism -- contradicts the principle of self government that lies at the heart of citizenship." Paid volunteerism, he wrote, would sap the strength of the nonprofit sector at precisely the moment when it most needs to flourish.
 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This argument ignores the experience of the past two years. Many of America's most respected nonprofits, from Big Brothers/Big Sisters to the YMCA to the American Red Cross, participate in and staunchly support AmeriCorps. A year ago, leaders of 24 volunteer groups wrote that AmeriCorps is an "enormously beneficial addition to the traditional voluntary sector. This program has not undermined our position, rather it has enhanced our efforts and strengthened our institutions."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To understand why, consider the case of Habitat for Humanity, one of the most successful faith-based volunteer groups. The founder, Millard Fuller, was wary of any involvement with AmeriCorps precisely because he feared a government program would distort the religious nature of his effort. But on the urging of his board, Habitat brought in some AmeriCorps members.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Fuller used AmeriCorps to solve a particular problem. Habitat was flooded with good people who wanted to help build houses but didn't have enough full-time crew leaders to organize the volunteers. They selected AmeriCorps applicants who they thought might help. These full-time AmeriCorps members dramatically increased the number and effectiveness of the unpaid volunteers. In Miami, for instance, two dozen Habitat-AmeriCorps members coordinated, organized, trained, and worked alongside about 5,000 unpaid volunteers, who together built 50 homes in a little more than a year.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now Fuller is a fan. "As AmeriCorps members gain in construction skill," he says, "our affiliates are able to expand the number of occasional volunteers through increased capacity to supervise and manage volunteers. We at Habitat for Humanity feel privileged and honored to have AmeriCorps people with us, and we want more of them."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Habitat's experience is instructive, not only because it is Newt Gingrich's favorite charity, but because it is a faith-based organization that did not have to alter its spiritual mission to make use of AmeriCorps members. This has been the experience of all the religious groups -- from the nuns of the Notre Dame de Namur mission to the Greater Dallas Community Churches -- that have brought on AmeriCorps members. The reason for their confidence is simple: they choose the AmeriCorps members, they train them, and if they're not working out, they send them home.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Habitat story is not unusual. One independent study has found that each AmeriCorps member has "leveraged" 12 unstipended volunteers. It was a recognition that volunteer groups need a cadre of full-time people to organize volunteers that led George Romney to refer to full-time stipended service and unpaid volunteers as the "twin engines of service."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even if one accepts the idea that volunteers need to be organized, why not just give the money to the nonprofit to hire its own full-time staff person? Because charities are quite capable of becoming bureaucratic. We need an infusion of people who plan to work only a year or two and have not, therefore, developed a careerist mindset. Besides, AmeriCorps members are much cheaper than full-time staff.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Service programs also provide a nonbureaucratic alternative to traditional government. One of the reasons the Peace Corps has enjoyed bipartisan support is that the money funds volunteers directly. Someday conservatives will view domestic national service as the antidote to bureaucracy. </td></tr></table>	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider what AmeriCorps members have accomplished in rural, impoverished Simpson County, Kentucky. Over nine months of service in 1995, 122 second-graders served by 25 AmeriCorps members saw their reading comprehension scores improve by more than three grade levels. Thirty-seven percent improved by four or more grade levels. The reasons for success are quite simple. AmeriCorps volunteers can develop intense, one-on-one tutoring relationships and become familiar with the academic and emotional problems of the child. Just as important, AmeriCorps members visit each student's home every other week to show parents their child's classroom materials and suggest ways for them to help. Parental involvement has increased dramatically. Would this have happened if the federal government had given the grant to the state education agency?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Simply put, the nonprofits that use AmeriCorps members can provide services more efficiently, humanely, and cost-effectively than government can.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There has been a great deal of confusion about the costs of AmeriCorps. The standard AmeriCorps living allowance is $7,945 -- about $160 a week -- of which $6,700 comes from the federal government. Those members with no health insurance also get a health plan valued at $1,200. So direct compensation is just more than $9,000. If they finish a year of service, they get a $4,725 scholarship.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	On top of that, the Corporation for National Service gives grants to local programs to help manage the AmeriCorps members. If the program builds low-income housing, that might include the cost of supplies. If the program establishes crew-based corps, that might include the cost of supervising them. If the corps helps a disaster-struck area, this would include travel costs. Then there are the administrative costs, which are distributed between the headquarters staff and the governor-appointed state commissions that distribute much of the money. The total cost to the Corporation per AmeriCorps member averages $18,800.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Programs are encouraged to raise outside money to supplement that provided by the federal government. Indeed, they can choose to add extra training, supplies, or supervision if they feel that enriches the quality--but only if they raise the money from somewhere else.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	At first blush, $18,000 "per corps member" sounds like a lot of money. But think about it. This is direct compensation plus all the other costs associated with the program. If you used the same calculus for Microsoft Corp. -- the total budget divided by the number of employees -- the average "cost per employee" would be about $150,000.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It's easy to see that this methodology has limited value, for it doesn't tell what you are getting for your money. We know what "benefit" or "product" the Microsoft investment produces. The truth is $18,000 could be a lousy deal -- or a real bargain -- depending on what the AmeriCorps members do.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>AmeriCorps members help solve problems.</b> According to partial results from a study by Aguirre Associates, an independent consulting firm, 1,353 AmeriCorps members in 12 states restored 24 beaches, enhanced 338 miles of river banks, planted 200,000 trees, constructed 440 dams, and cleaned up 139 neighborhoods. In all, they estimated these Corps members working on environmental issues in those states "affected the lives" of 469,000 people.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Three separate independent evaluations of the cost-benefit ratio of the program predict measurable returns between $1.54 and $2.60 for every AmeriCorps dollar invested. Each study concluded that AmeriCorps's full value is understated because the benefits of safer streets, better schools, stronger communities, and more active citizens are difficult to quantify and not seen immediately. The high return is part of the reason that more than 600 companies -- from Microsoft to G.E. to local grocers -- have supported local AmeriCorps programs. Stanley Litow, an officer of the IBM International Foundation, summed up his company's satisfaction by stating, "IBM expects a return on investment, and it bases its funding decisions on demonstrable results. . . . This program works."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider a program called L.A. Vets, which helps homeless Vietnam veterans become sober and independent. This nonprofit, established with the help of groups like the Disabled American Veterans, runs a 210-bed transitional home that provides 24-hour-a-day support, counseling, and job placement. Program managers conduct drug-testing regularly and expel those who flunk, a tough-love policy beyond the capacity of government bureaucracies. They require the veterans to maintain Westside Residence and pay $235 in rent, a demand that is both cost-effective and therapeutic. AmeriCorps didn't create this program but the 11 corps members at the Westside Residence, according to L.A. Vets' founders, have enabled them to start small businesses staffed by the veterans, stock a library, and make effective use of outside volunteers--including employees of a local computer business who teach the veterans how to repair computers. AmeriCorps members, in other words, have helped veterans become independent of government aid. As of this spring, only about one-quarter of the vets who moved in a year ago were back on the street. One-quarter were in treatment programs and half remained in transitional or independent housing, more sober and hopeful than they've been in years. And it's a good deal for taxpayers. The program has helped move more than 200 veterans out of veterans hospitals, where they would have cost the government $20,000 per year each.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
About two-thirds of AmeriCorps projects address the problems of the young. AmeriCorps members tutor, operate after-school programs, work with gangs to reduce violence, create safe havens and safe corridors, and organize students to volunteer. Our record in these areas is one reason Governor Pete Wilson turned to the California Commission on Community Service to help reach his goal of providing at-risk youth in California with 250,000 mentors by the year 2000.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>AmeriCorps changes those who perform the service.</b> Full-time service, whether in AmeriCorps or in the armed forces, is a rite of passage that helps create well-rounded adults and citizens. They are expected to be resourceful and show leadership. On a more mundane level, they might learn practical skills -- how to build a floor level, how to calm a crowd in an emergency, how to lead a team, or even how to show up on time.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For low-income youth, service provides a different experience than traditional government make-work jobs or training programs. AmeriCorps implicitly accepts conservative arguments against indiscriminate aid to the poor. All major religions teach that it is more blessed to give than receive. This is not only a moral instruction but a statement about human psychology: If you treat someone as a dependent, they will view themselves as such. Low-income citizens, who make up about a quarter of AmeriCorps volunteers, are earning a government benefit by serving, instead of being served. The principle was illustrated by a young high-school dropout, who left a street gang to join the Philadelphia Youth Service Corps. "Look, all my life people had been coming to help me," he said. "For the first time, this Corps asked me to do some good." <td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">H</font>abitat for Humanity did not have to alter its spiritual mission to make use of AmeriCorps members. </h3><hr width=75></td> </td></tr></table>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>AmeriCorps teaches the right values.</b> AmeriCorps challenges young people to give something to their community and country. It teaches them, in the words of William Buckley, to have "gratitude" for being given so much. It instills core values of hard work, discipline, and teamwork that make young people not only more productive workers but also better citizens.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>AmeriCorps combats balkanization.</b> By bringing people of different backgrounds together, AmeriCorps can combat ethnic and social fragmentation. Members who come to AmeriCorps from college quickly realize that the separatism they learned on campus has to be replaced by teamwork. Here again, the goal is to replicate some of the successes of the military. The World War II draft was the nation's most effective class-mixing institution. The modern army is the most effective race-mixing institution. Because they are so focused on staying alive or achieving a military objective, soldiers inevitably have to focus on individual characteristics rather than group traits. National service can be the most effective means we have for dealing with our nation's racial problems. National service may ultimately replace affirmative action as the primary means for bridging the racial divide.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>AmeriCorps expands educational opportunity.</b> This is often cited as the main benefit of AmeriCorps, but it really doesn't make sense to spend $18,000 per member if the only benefit is extra college aid. However, the education award is proving to be an effective way of drawing people into service. And the AmeriCorps experience expands educational opportunity in a more subtle way -- by raising the aspirations of those who serve. We have seen many individuals who decided to go to college because their service convinced them that they were capable of greater things. Many of them in turn impart this sense of broad horizons to elementary or high-school students they tutor.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some conservatives have argued that even if AmeriCorps does worthwhile things now, it will inevitably evolve into a bloated bureaucracy that smothers local initiative. This is the strongest argument against AmeriCorps. Many an enterprise, public and private, that started out lean and flexible eventually became ossified.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	AmeriCorps, though, will likely improve, not worsen, because of its basic structure. It is locally based and relies on a competitive grantmaking process. Two-thirds of the money goes directly to state commissions, which choose among competitive proposals from local nonprofit groups.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	AmeriCorps is nonpartisan. By law, the state commissions comprise an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, appointed by governors -- three-fifths of whom are currently Republicans. AmeriCorps supporters must acknowledge that the success of this program stems in no small part from the leadership of some Republican governors. And those who dislike this program must also recognize that "Bill Clinton's pet project," as it is so often called, is being shaped in large part by Republicans.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We at the Corporation have been willing to learn. The traditional government posture -- cover up problems as quickly as possible -- may work for a while, but it does not make for good programs. Among our mistakes:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We have taken too long to switch from an old-style government accounting system to a more rigorous, private-sector model. As a result, our books were recently found "unauditable" using the new accounting standards. We are now bringing in outside financial experts to make the Corporation a model of government financial accountability.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We funded a grant to Acorn Housing Corp., which is closely associated with an advocacy agenda. When we found out that Acorn had crossed the line into political advocacy, we pulled the plug. (Among our 400 programs and 1,200 sites we have found only a handful that have engaged in political advocacy.)<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We saw that some of our programs were spending too much money on management and overhead. So, we have told AmeriCorps's national and state grantees with above average costs that they must cut costs by 10 percent. And as part of our cost-cutting agreement with <a href="http://www.senate.gov/senator/grassley.html">Senator Charles Grassley</a> of Iowa, we've committed to specific average cost targets -- $17,000 per member next year, $16,000 the next, and $15,000 in 1999.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In our first years, the programs raised $41 million from the private sector -- $9 million more than the authorizing legislation required from all nonfederal sources -- but some programs were relying too heavily on school districts, police departments, and other units of local government. So this year, we have required all of our programs to raise some money from the private sector.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite our efforts to make all our programs models of excellence, some did not succeed. So the Corporation for National Service or the state commissions stopped funding them. Fifty of the first-year AmeriCorps programs were not renewed -- 15 percent of the total. We realize that such a statistic can be used against us by our opponents. However, since the difference between business and government is the willingness to correct mistakes, this is probably the most businesslike thing we have done.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Having argued the substance of national service, I would like to close on a political note. House Republicans last year put themselves in an awkward position on AmeriCorps. They placed themselves on the wrong side of their own ideology, and played right into the old Democratic argument that Republicans are heartless and uninterested in solving social problems.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Republicans need not compound the error by giving this issue to Democrats. Voters do not automatically associate civilian service with Democrats. If Republicans embrace it, and put on their own imprint, people will look back 10 years from now and say AmeriCorps was a program that Democrats created and Republicans improved. Republicans could then be known as tough <i>and</i> compassionate, skeptical <i>and</i> wise. And along the way, Republicans will have truly helped transform the country from one that relies on government to solve problems to one that relies on citizen service.<P><i><b>Harris Wofford</b>, a former Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, is the CEO of the Corporation for National Service. <b>Steven Waldman</b> is his senior advisor for policy, planning, and evaluation.

<b>National Service -- or Government Service?
<br>
by Doug Bandow</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Service has a long and venerable history in the U.S., and it remains strong today. Three-quarters of American households give to charity. About 90 million adults volunteer; the value of their time has been estimated by the Independent Sector at nearly $200 billion.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Impressive as this is, it isn't enough to meet all of the pressing human needs that face our society. For example, Harris Wofford and Steven Waldman worry that the entry of women into the work force will reduce the number of volunteers. Hence, in their view, the need for a government program like the Corporation for National Service. </td></tr></table><p>
 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The desire to give Uncle Sam a senior management position in the service business goes back at least a century, to <i>Looking Backward</i>, a novel by lawyer and journalist Edward Bellamy. He envisioned compulsory service for all men and women between the ages of 21 and 45, resulting in a peaceful and prosperous utopia. <i>Looking Backward</i> was the best-selling book of its time and inspired the establishment of some 165 Bellamy clubs to push his egalitarian social system. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two decades later, William James advocated the "moral equivalent of war," in which all young men would be required to work for the community. He argued that "the martial virtues, although originally gained by the race through war, are absolute and permanent human goods," and that national service could instill those same values in peacetime.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Most national service advocates today eschew such far-reaching utopian visions of social transformation. Nevertheless, the desire to create the good society through service lives on. Some advocates have seen national service as a means to provide training and employment, to encourage social equality, to promote civic-mindedness, or to expand access to college. Margaret Mead even saw it as a way to help liberate children from their parents. The legislative process always shrank such grandiose proposals into much more limited programs, such as the Peace Corps and, in 1993, the National and Community Service Trust Act, which established the Corporation for National and Community Service. But many of the grander goals remain -- and are expressed by Wofford and Waldman: transforming participants, teaching values, combating balkanization, and expanding educational opportunity.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	Thus, the heritage of national service -- this desire for government to promote ends other than service -- is critical to understanding today's program and recognizing the pitfalls of government involvement. When we evaluate the Corporation and the thousands of AmeriCorps members, we must ask: service to whom and organized by whom?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Americans have worked in their communities since the nation's founding. Businesses, churches, and schools all actively help organize their members' efforts. Service in America is so vital because it is decentralized and privately organized, addresses perceived needs, and grows out of people's sense of duty and compassion. Any federal service program must be judged by whether it is consistent with this vision of volunteer service. Wofford and Waldman think yes. I'm less sanguine.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The mandatory variants of service obviously do not share this vision. In fact, the explicit goal of advocates of mandatory service programs was (and remains) to create a duty to the state rather than to the supposed beneficiaries of service. Moreover, service is to fit into a larger social plan implemented and enforced by government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, AmeriCorps is not mandatory, and Wofford and Waldman amass an impressive list of testimonials from private groups that welcome the Corporation's support. But, no one should be surprised that volunteer organizations might welcome financial assistance and "free" help. Washington's funds, however, could prove almost as powerful as its mandates in reshaping the independent sector. Some voluntary organizations recognize the danger. David King of the Ohio-West Virginia YMCA has warned: "The national service movement and the National Corporation are not about encouraging volunteering or community service. The national service movement is about institutionalizing federal funding for national and community service. It is about changing the language and understanding of service to eliminate the words 'volunteer' and 'community service' and in their place implant the idea that service is something paid for by the government."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	King's fears are well founded. The history of the welfare state is the history of public enterprise pushing out private organization. The impact was largely unintentional, but natural and inevitable. Higher taxes left individuals with less money to give; government's assumption of responsibility for providing welfare shriveled the perceived duty of individuals to respond to their neighbors' needs; and the availability of public programs gave recipients an alternative to private assistance, one which did not challenge recipients to reform their destructive behavior. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Corporation, despite the good intentions of people like Wofford and Waldman, risks doing the same thing to philanthropy. A federal "service" program risks teaching Americans that the duty of giving, and the job of deciding who is worthy to receive charity, belongs to government and not average people throughout society. At some point service to society could become widely equated with work for government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Glimmerings of this problem have already surfaced. For instance, the Corporation treats "public" service as inherently better than private service. Service, however, comes in many forms. Being paid by the government to shelve books in a library, whether as an employee or as an AmeriCorps member, is no more laudable or valuable than being paid by Crown Books to stock bookshelves in a bookstore. A host of private-sector jobs provide enormous public benefits -- consider health-care professionals, medical and scientific researchers, entrepreneurs, inventors, and artists. Many of these people earn less than they could in alternative work; they have chosen to serve in their own way. Yet government programs that equate public employment with service to society effectively denigrate service through private employment.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This public-sector bias is reflected in the fact that 2,800 of the first 20,000 AmeriCorps participants were assigned to federal agencies. For instance, the Department of the Interior used AmeriCorps workers to "update geological and hydrological information for the U.S. Geological Survey" and restore wetlands and wildlife habitat. Jobs like these are respectable, but they resemble traditional government employment rather than "service." While AmeriCorps participants may do good work as government employees, such activities are not likely to promote volunteerism around the country.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A more subtle problem is the likely long-term effect of federal funding on the volunteer groups and those who normally support volunteer groups. It is, in the abstract, hard to criticize grants to organizations like Habitat for Humanity (which until now refused to accept government funding), Big Brothers/Big Sisters, and the Red Cross. These groups do good work and money given to them is likely to be well spent.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Who, however, should do the giving? It is certainly simpler for the IRS to empty pockets nationwide and hand a bit of the tax haul to the Corporation, which, in turn, gives it to charity. But the right way is for individuals to send their money directly to deserving groups. That Habitat for Humanity could use more full-time employees to supervise its ample private volunteers is understandable; that it should turn to the government for the resources to hire those volunteers is not.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Indeed, at its most basic level, real charity doesn't mean giving away someone else's money. As Marvin Olasky has pointed out, compassion once meant to "suffer with." Over time it came to mean writing a check. Now it seems to be equated with making someone else write a check. At least public welfare programs are theoretically accountable to taxpayers for their activities. But collecting taxes for private charities, especially those with philosophical or theological viewpoints that may conflict with those of many taxpayers, is especially dubious.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Nor is dependence on government healthy for private philanthropic groups. Although they get to choose and train volunteers funded by the Corporation, it seems inevitable that government will end up favoring some activities and disfavoring others. Such preferences may not be nefarious, but groups will be tempted to adjust their mission to become eligible for federal funding. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even if the Corporation eschews the natural temptation to meddle, the behavior of recipients is likely to change. Groups will be tempted to shift their fundraising from private appeals to "public education" and formal lobbying. After all, government checks tend to be much larger and cheaper to obtain than private donations.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Wofford and Waldman contend that government funding will prevent private groups from becoming bureaucratic by furnishing them with short-term volunteers, who won't develop "a careerist mindset." It's not clear why career volunteers would be a problem. In fact, some problems are better met by experienced volunteers. Surely volunteer groups, if they found careerism to be a problem, could, if adequately funded, hire precisely the sort of people who now join AmeriCorps. Money does not have to be funneled through government to ensure that private groups receive "new energy," as Wofford and Waldman put it.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Moreover, government's growing role in funding private groups, however worthy, is likely to encourage people to further abdicate their civic responsibilities. If we are serious about strengthening civil society and reviving a sense of individual duty to help those in need, we must emphasize contributing as well as volunteering. People will feel less pressure to volunteer time and money if the government not only provides public welfare programs but funds charitable groups. Wofford and Waldman cite private support for local AmeriCorps programs as evidence of their value. But AmeriCorps isn't necessary for IBM, G.E., Microsoft, and local grocers to support service programs. Private-sector funding should preempt, not follow, government involvement.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Boosting contributions will address one of the problems that Wofford and Waldman mention: the increase in women who have entered the work force and therefore have less time to volunteer. If they are working, they should have more money to contribute, and they should be encouraged to do so, thereby helping to fund full-time volunteers.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In fact, thoughtfully choosing which charities to support, and monitoring their activities are themselves important forms of volunteerism. Sending money off to Washington for distribution to private groups benefits the recipients, but no one else. By contrast, the sinews of community grow stronger when people stay informed, give voluntarily, and get involved. As we attempt to shrink the welfare state, getting more people to give more and to take more time considering where to give should be one of our highest priorities.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, AmeriCorps may have undesirable consequences on volunteers. Undoubtedly, many volunteers paid by the government really believe in what they are doing. But the Corporation has turned service into a job, one that, counting the tax-free voucher, pays more than other entry-level employment. Some participants have privately admitted that they see national service as a remunerative job option, not a unique opportunity to help the community. Indeed, much of the president's pitch during the campaign was framed in terms of naked self-interest: earning credit toward college tuition. There's nothing wrong with joining AmeriCorps to do so, of course. But doing so really isn't more noble than, say, pumping gas for the same reason.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Indeed, government-funded service plays into what some national-service proponents have denounced as an entitlement mentality -- the idea that, for instance, students have a right to a taxpayer-paid education. Some advocates of national service have rightly asked: Why should middle-class young people be able to force poor taxpayers to help put them through school? But public "service" jobs sweetened with a salary and an educational grant are no solution: they merely transform the kind of employment that a young person seeks to help cover his educational expenses. Some AmeriCorps volunteers do sacrifice, but there is no real sacrifice involved in, say, informing people about the availability of Federal Emergency Management Agency service centers, maintaining vehicles, surveying residents about recreational interests, cutting vegetation, and changing light bulbs in dilapidated schools -- all activities funded by the Corporation. In contrast, consider the sort of tasks envisioned by William James: young laborers would be sent off "to coal and iron mines, to freight trains, to fishing fleets in December."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 The real solution to the entitlement mentality is not to say that students are entitled to taxpayer aid as long as they work for the government for a year or two, but to rethink who deserves the subsidy. We also need to explore how federal educational assistance may have actually made it harder for students to afford college by fueling tuition hikes (the schools, of course, are the ultimate beneficiaries of most student aid). And we have to address the host of other "entitlements" that riddle the federal budget and sap people's independence.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, there is the more practical question as to whether taxpayers are likely to get their money's worth from the service provided by AmeriCorps members. Wofford and Waldman cite impressive statistics about trees planted and beaches restored, and there's no doubt that much good work has and will be done by AmeriCorps volunteers. But there is no guarantee that taxpayer-funded "service" will be worth its cost.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider the opportunity costs of national service. "Public service" has a nice ring to it, but a dollar going to national service will not necessarily yield more benefits than an additional dollar spent on medical research, technological innovation, business investment, or any number of other private and public purposes. Nor is hiring, say, a potential doctor to spend a year surveying residents, handling paperwork, or replacing light bulbs necessarily a good deal -- in terms of economics or service.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unfortunately, some waste is almost inevitable. Local organizations are not likely to use essentially "free" labor from the federal government as efficiently as if they had to cover the costs themselves, because staff members will be tempted to assign work they prefer not to do themselves to the subsidized outsiders. For example, in Orange County, California, the Civic Center Barrio Housing Corp. used AmeriCorps personnel to solicit donations and handle paperwork. Corporation critics have, in fact, generated their own roll of waste to counter Wofford and Waldman's list of successes.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another potentially important opportunity cost is the diversion of bright men and women from the military. The end of the Cold War has sharply cut recruiting requirements, but it has also reduced the perceived national need. As a result, the armed forces have had greater difficulty in attracting quality recruits. Yet various programs of educational benefits have always been an important vehicle for drawing college-capable youth into the military. Providing similar benefits for civilian service is likely to hinder recruiting for what remains the most fundamental form of national service -- defending the nation. Surveys have found that a majority of potential recruits would consider joining AmeriCorps rather than the armed forces because they see it as a better way to gain educational assistance.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If AmeriCorps is not the answer, what is? First, government barriers in the way of private individuals and groups who want to help should be torn down. Minimum-wage laws effectively forbid the hiring of dedicated but unskilled people; every increase makes this problem worse. Restrictions on paratransit operations limit private transportation for the disabled. Regulations also hinder other forms of volunteerism. Unnecessary health department restrictions prevent restaurants in Los Angeles and elsewhere from donating food to the hungry, for instance. In short, in many cases important needs are unmet precisely because of perverse government policy.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Second, leaders throughout society, from lawmakers to clerics to philanthropists to corporate presidents, need to emphasize that the ultimate responsibility to help those in need lies with individuals, families, and communities, not government. They need to create a more traditional sense of compassion, the idea that charity requires personal commitment -- both in volunteering time and exercising careful stewardship over charitable contributions. This requires highlighting the needs of the disadvantaged and groups seeking to help the disadvantaged, and emphasizing that people can no longer act as if they "gave at the office" through government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Third, policymakers need to consider tax incentives, particularly tax credits for charitable donations, to encourage people to volunteer their money. A goal of $500 million in new contributions--a mere $2 a person and more than now spent by the Corporation -- might be a reasonable start.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, to the extent that serious social problems remain, government should use narrowly targeted responses to meet the most serious problems. That is, it would be better to find a way to attract several thousand people to help care for the terminally ill than to lump that task in with teaching, planting trees, changing light bulbs, administrative work, and scores of other jobs to be solved by a force of tens or hundreds of thousands. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	AmeriCorps was created with the best of intentions. But the Corporation for National  Service cannot escape its statist heritage: it promotes service, but shifts the center of gravity in the volunteer community from civil to political society. What we need instead is a renewed commitment to individual service. People, in community with one another, need to help meet the many serious social problems that beset us. But private activism needs neither oversight nor subsidy from Uncle Sam. Some of the volunteerism can be part-time and some full-time; some can take place within the family, some within churches, and some within civic and community groups. Some may occur through profit-making ventures.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The point is, there is no predetermined definition of service, pattern of appropriate involvement, set of "needs" to be met or tasks to be fulfilled. America's strength is its combination of humanitarian impulses, private association, and diversity. We need service, not "national service."<p><i><b>Doug Bandow</b> is a senior fellow at the <a href="http://www.cato.org">Cato Institute</a> and the author of several books, including</i> The Politics of Envy: Statism as Theology <i>(Transaction)</i>.

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Of all the passions that distort one's view of politics, the greatest, I think, is the desire for closure, the yearning for some golden moment at which it can be said, "Well, that's the end of that." The jury announcing its verdict, the emissaries of a defeated power signing the papers of unconditional surrender, the poker player beating a full house with four of a kind -- decisive and final.<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">T</font>he 104th Congress has learned that in politics there are no permanent victories - that the fat lady never sings</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Perhaps it's understandable. Our politics does have built-in cycles with closure of a sort, namely, elections. Every four years, we have an opportunity to elect a new president or affirm the tenure of the one we have; every two years, we have a new Congress. And the outcome of these elections is rarely ambiguous. Candidate A wins or loses. The <a href="http://www.house.gov">House</a> has this many Republicans and that many Democrats. Moreover, the legislative process itself has various endpoints: the moments after the committee report and the floor vote and the conference and the bill-signing ceremony in the Rose Garden, just as the civics textbooks say.</td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even here, closure in politics is overblown. In politics, little is ever settled once and for all. The day after the election is the first day of the next election cycle. So you got a bill passed? Fine. Now an army of bureaucrats will begin writing the regulations and other means of enforcing it; the courts will begin pondering its meaning; the lawmakers themselves, aided by an army of lobbyists and other interested parties, will prepare for the next go-round. Politics ebbs and flows. Victory and defeat are never permanent. "Endism"--the yearning for closure--often amounts to substituting one's political fantasies for reality.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The essential fact of the 104th Congress is that, as the first GOP Congress in 40 years, it did not live up to the expectations it helped create. Many of its members rode into town two years ago promising nothing less than "revolution." But the budget is not balanced, nor is there a constitutional amendment requiring that it be balanced. There has been no tax relief for families with children, no cut in the capital-gains tax rate, no expanded Individual Retirement Accounts. Nor have we seen fundamental reform in Medicaid for the poor and Medicare for the elderly: Most of the vast entitlement apparatus stands untouched. Broad regulatory relief remains elusive.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Was the 104th Congress, then, a failure? The position of the Democratic Party sounds like this: The Republicans vastly misinterpreted the results of the 1994 elections that brought them to power. They claimed a broad mandate for change where none existed. Moreover, they were never candid about the specifics of the changes they intended to make. Once the details began to emerge, in the Democratic view, the American people recoiled from the Republicans' extremist positions. Popular opinion turned against this new Congress and its living embodiment, House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Republican expectations that their party would sweep the 1995 off-year elections turned out to be wrong. President Clinton stood up to the GOP legislative blackmail represented by two shutdowns of the federal government. The people responded by supporting him in opinion polls. The Republicans, reeling and desperate, finally gave up. Democrats prepared to take their case to the people in the fall elections, with an excellent chance, they say, of retaining the White House and regaining the Congress, as people think more about what GOP bombthrowers have been trying to do to American society and government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This telling is also the version offered by the establishment media. I will leave it to future historians to determine whether the Democratic line and the establishment media's analysis coincide so well because they simply reflect the truth of the situation, or for some other reason. You can also hear this interpretation in certain Republican circles, such as when Al D'Amato launched his celebrated screed against Gingrich, his Contract, and GOP extremism in the spring of 1996. Boiled down, the theme of this argument is: game over. Republicans had their chance, they blew it, and that's the end of that.<p><table>
<tr width=80>
<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But, in fact, it's not the end of that. Before too long, Democrats will likely be reminded of the fallacy of endism. Even if Republicans lose  this November, they are not going to fold their tent and go away. Novels may have a beginning, a middle, and an end, but politics is a perpetual middle.</td><td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">T</font>he essential fact of the 104th Congress is that it did not live up to the expectations it helped create</h3><hr width=75></td>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Republicans recently suffered their own brutal lesson in the fallacy of endism. Weren't the Democrats finished, kaput, toast, less than two years ago? Wasn't the Democratic president trying to persuade everybody (including, it seemed, himself) of his own relevance? Wasn't the juggernaut of popular opinion that swept the GOP in and the Democrats out going to overpower whatever feeble resistance might be offered by a weak, rudderless, scandal-plagued administration? And wasn't this all merely prologue to the completion of the, well, Revolution--in 1996, when Americans would surely elect a Republican to the White House and all good things would be in legislative reach? And doesn't that all seem a bit naive just now?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Surely it was unrealistic to expect a true revolution as long as President Clinton occupied the White House, Senate Democrats wielded the power of the filibuster, and House Republicans held only a slim majority. But judged by more modest standards, Republicans in the 104th Congress actually achieved a great deal. And the chief obstacle to the rest of their agenda was Bill Clinton and his veto pen. Didn't get your tax cut? Talk to Clinton. Budget not balanced? Clinton didn't want to balance it. Federal regulators and a legal system still out of control? Clinton vetoed changes. Medicare careening toward insolvency? Been there, vetoed that.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Republicans can also muster a fairly decent <a href="/heritage/congress">list of things</a> they did manage to get through. The biggest one was surely a welfare overhaul in the form of a broad "devolution" of responsibility to the states. This was, in fact, transforming legislation, an end to a federal entitlement program that was for 30 years <i>the</i> symbol of the promise and failure of the War on Poverty.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In addition, the president now has a line-item veto, which Democratic Congresses repeatedly refused to give Ronald Reagan. The candidate elected in November will be the first president with the power to use it. Congress also completed a massive revision of telecommunications law, which ought to open up some promising technological vistas and provide more competition in cable, broadcasting, telephone, and information services.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To everyone's surprise, the vast, centralized apparatus of American agricultural policy was significantly reformed in the Freedom to Farm Act. In lieu of the complicated formulas and procedures that determine how much wheat, corn, rice, and cotton -- the four major "program crops" -- farmers can plant and sell, growers will get a declining subsidy over five years (based on the level of their previous payments from Washington) and freedom to plant crops as they see fit.<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">W</font>as it realistic to expect a true revolution with Bill Clinton in the White House, Democrats filibustering in the Senate, and the GOP holding a slim majority in the House? </h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Congress overrode a presidential veto of securities-litigation reform designed to protect companies from unreasonable class-action lawsuits when their stock price declines. The antiterrorism bill provided a vehicle for streamlining the use of habeas corpus in federal death penalty appeals. And, of course, the national speed limit is history.</td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At this writing, there are a couple of other possibilities for significant legislation. Passage of an immigration-reform bill containing sharp restrictions on illegal immigration -- but surprisingly unnativist on legal immigrants -- seems imminent, and the president is widely expected to sign it. There is also a possibility of legislation designed to make health insurance more portable, including a provision for a small experiment with Medical Savings Accounts. And, ahem, how about that minimum-wage increase?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No, this record doesn't add up to a revolution. It hasn't transformed the policy landscape to resemble maps designed by Republicans. On the other hand, the 104th Congress has nothing to be ashamed of. This is a solid record of legislative achievement. And Republicans are right to say that the achievement would have been much greater had it not been for the president's rather sudden display of backbone, starting in the late fall of 1995. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	That resolve may have been precisely the quality Americans wanted to see in a president whose fecklessness had become something of a national joke, and they rewarded him with higher approval ratings. On the other hand, the president did pass up at least one historic opportunity. As Senator John Ashcroft, the freshman Republican from Missouri, has observed, every president goes to bed at night praying that Congress will announce some major entitlement reform the next day. Even modest changes in entitlement programs usually require blue-ribbon commissions to provide political cover. But this Congress offered two -- not only welfare reform, which Clinton would go along with only the third time a bill landed on his desk, but also a much more politically tricky Medicare fix. The president walked away from Medicare, even though he and his advisers knew the insolvency of the program is certain in the absence of program changes. The White House shamelessly protested the horrific Republican "cuts" in Medicare -- make that "gutting," "slashing," and "destroying" Medicare. The opinion polls favored the president. But they would likely have continued to do so even if he had actually chosen to behave constructively. Clinton could have split the rather small difference with Republicans and anointed himself the savior of Medicare--not only from bankruptcy, but also from heartless Republicans eager to slash it to pay for tax cuts for the rich. For the White House, though, relentless counterattack was the order of the day. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Besides welfare reform, the Republican Congress got the president to agree to something truly extraordinary in one other area: discretionary (that is, nonentitlement) spending. This is the part of government determined each year through the appropriations process--the 11 big bills that fund the operations of the government itself, and without which (or some other mechanism agreeable to Congress and the president) we get a shutdown. Clinton vetoed a number of these bills and signed only a couple, but the shutdowns led to the other spending mechanism, the "continuing resolution" that set spending levels for all programs where appropriations bills had gone unsigned. To that measure Clinton attached his signature.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Every year since 1969, spending in the domestic (that is, nonmilitary) discretionary category has increased. (Military spending has had its ups and downs and is now in a sharp decline that has been partially ameliorated by the GOP). That changed in fiscal 1996. The Republican Congress actually did cut spending--not reductions in the rate of increase, not "cuts" against a rising baseline, not "cuts" after adjusting for inflation, but genuine reductions. Domestic discretionary spending was $246 billion in fiscal 1995 and $223 billion in fiscal 1996.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; By contrast, the Clinton administration wanted to spend $30 billion more in 1996 than 1995, instead of $17 billion less. The proposed Clinton budget for the year would have yielded a deficit of $211 billion. Current projections from the Congressional Budget Office show a fiscal 1996 deficit of $117 billion. Economic growth that exceeded projections account for some of this difference. But more than half is the result of cuts in domestic discretionary spending.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As <a href="/heritage/staff/utt.html">Ronald D. Utt</a> of The Heritage Foundation has noted, appropriators achieved these savings in part by eliminating some 200 government programs and scaling back many others. The cynical conventional view of Washington has long held that the closest thing to eternal life in this world is a federal government program. Well, good riddance to the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (to say nothing of the welfare entitlement).<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The discouraging thing is that this $23 billion in savings came out of a federal budget totaling $1.57 trillion, up (thanks to entitlements) from $1.52 trillion last year. In short, the cuts amounted to less than 1.5 percent of total spending.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And yet this truly was a reversal of a course that had been followed for 26 years. Surely it means something when a Democratic president declares in his State of the Union address that "the era of Big Government is over." Surely, as well, it means something when that same president tacks sharply to the right as he takes his case for re-election to the voters.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This has been the real Republican solace in the face of frustration during the 104th Congress. The terms of the debate have changed, Republicans tell themselves. America is, undeniably, a conservative country now. Democrats recognize that the old-fashioned, liberal, Big Government agenda is now a loser, and they know that to survive politically, they must run as conservatives. They may, for a time, be able to get away with running right and governing left, as Clinton is trying to do. But eventually their own record will catch up with them, and voters will select the real thing rather than the ersatz version.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I think there is much truth to this analysis, but there is something about it that bothers me, and that is its endism. William F. Buckley Jr. once wrote, famously, that the conservative mission is "to stand athwart history, shouting 'Stop!'" I have long thought that the problem with this formulation is that history isn't listening. And now conservatives are erring in the other direction, rushing to the conclusion that they represent the future. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The spending cuts of fiscal 1996 and the advertised end of the era of Big Government are remarkable achievements. But there is nothing permanent about them, and Republicans are deluding themselves if they think otherwise. It is pleasant, in some sense, to think that large forces are at one's back -- certainly more pleasant than the experience of swimming upstream, with which conservatives are plenty familiar. And if public-opinion polls mean anything, the electorate is clearly more responsive to conservative proposals for solving problems than to huge new government bureaucracies. Yet this does not spare Republicans the responsibility and drudgery of fighting, fighting, fighting the daily battles of practical politics, against those who would like government to assume even more control over the lives of the American people. The measure of victory is not just the passage of vast, transforming legislation but also the extinguishing of the lights at the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The most compelling problem of practical politics for Republicans is that they are not as popular right now as they imagined they would be. Whether this decline in popularity threatens their hold on Congress, whether the Democrats have really gained at their expense, whether the electorate in 1994 saw its choices for Congress as a choice between national policies, and whether 1996 will also be such an election--these are all questions that will be "settled" in November. In other words, we will argue about them for years.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The question for Republicans is how to rebuild their popularity. To answer that question, Republicans must first understand why their popularity rose and fell in the first place. Republicans often claim that by the end of last year, their message had gotten lost--lost in the obsessive focus on balancing the federal budget within seven years. Republicans took popular support for granted and lost sight of the need to explain why the budget had to be balanced. Some add that the message got lost in a media culture that has never understood the Republican agenda and remains hostile to it. In addition, the Clinton administration lied about what Republicans were actually proposing. The solution, in this analysis, is to figure out better ways of both framing the message and communicating it to the people.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Others have argued that the message was fundamentally flawed from the outset. The supply-side faction of the party, for example, has excoriated the Contract With America for failing to articulate a Reagan-Forbes-Kemp message of hope, growth, and opportunity--and never mind the budget deficit. Still others have said that the message was wrong because it is, as Democrats charged, too extreme. Why make sweeping changes in regulatory policy in areas where most people have come to trust the government -- clean water, clean air, and safe food and drugs?<p>

<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But I think the biggest problem came from the heady sense of victory following the 1994 elections: We win, they lose; the people are with us, the people are against them. And that's the way it is. Republicans in the House worked very hard on a plan for governing if they should find themselves in power. They studied the House's Democratic masters with care, fashioned a strategy for seizing a majority, and crafted a legislative agenda that they believed reflected the wishes of most Americans. When they finally won, they did what they had set out to do. The Senate is a very different place, less a stranger to Republican control but at the same time less susceptible to control altogether. Yet the Republican Senate went along, too.</td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And then . . . they didn't win it all. They did not get everything or even most of the things they wanted. They faced an opposition that did not always fight fair. And the American electorate, whom they thought they had squarely behind them, turned out not to be. Republicans retreated, they regrouped, they recriminated, they refought the battles they had won and the battles they had lost to try to figure out why. And they returned to fight another day, with this change in strategy and that change in tactics, and they recognized that the pursuit of total victory is dangerous when it comes unmoored from the daily business of democratic politics, which is to keep things moving your way while pleasing people.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Republicans learned that there is always another day, that this is not a game of chess or a mystery novel, but rather politics, in which nothing is ever settled once and for all and in which the illusion that things are can be your undoing. And that was the greatest accomplishment of the Republicans of the 104th Congress. They learned that in politics there are no permanent victories, that the fat lady never sings. And whether they hang on to Congress in 1996 or return to power in 1998 or later, this wisdom will be essential if they are to govern.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What

can government do, if anything, to make sure that the overwhelming majority of American children grow up with a mother and father?" <i>Policy Review</i> asked a number of family experts across the political spectrum to address this question, considering state and local government as well as the federal government. <p><hr><p>

<b><i> Encourage Parental Involvement </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	In the classic movie <i>King Kong</i>, the giant ape lifts the tiny heroine into his hairy hands with a puzzled look on his face, as if to say, "She's small and cute, but now what do I do with her?" Similarly, what can or should that giant leviathan known as "government" do to provide children with parental guidance? My first thought is the same one I had when I saw the massive Kong delicately hold the fragile heroine: "I hope he doesn't hurt her."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	 Government should always keep in mind that no one loves children more than their parents. There are many in Washington who believe otherwise, and think that <i>they</i> know what's best for your children. The best thing that government can do to ensure children grow up with a mother and father is to recognize that parents -- both a mother <i>and</i> a father -- are fundamental to a child's upbringing in the first place.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	 Government needs to encourage and solicit -- not frustrate -- parental involvement in the education of children. In the early 1930s, there were more than 130,000 school boards in the United States. Today, there are fewer than 15,000. We need to encourage parental participation by restoring local school boards for each and every school and empowering them -- together with faculty and administrators -- to determine educational policies and curricula. We must also enact school choice and voucher plans to give parents more control over their children's education.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Finally, we must stem the tide of divorce, including so-called "no-fault divorce." Nothing harms children more than losing the support and involvement of either parent, a frequent result of divorce. We should give the institution of marriage greater respect and protection. A marriage ought to be difficult to enter and even more difficult to leave. How about requiring a waiting period before every wedding?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	We need to acknowledge that government -- in any form -- can never provide what children need most: love. Only two people are qualified for that -- Mom and Dad.

<b><i> Revive the "Marriage Culture"</i></b>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; A distressing number of children in this nation will go to bed tonight without the participation of both a mother <i>and</i> father in an important family ritual: reading a bedtime story, saying nighttime prayers, and being tucked in with reassuring goodnight kisses. This experience is more and more often a solo act for one reason: the slow death of a marriage culture. It is being replaced by a culture of divorce and illegitimacy, each of which now exists, for the first time in our nation's history, in equal proportion to their opposites. It is paramount that we re-establish an appreciation of the value and virtue of marriage, both for the individual and society. As recent history shows, this work cannot rest on the ever-expanding shoulders of government (also known to some as "the village").	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; When Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote his report on the declining health of the black family in America, few authorities took his warning seriously -- except his boss, President Lyndon Johnson. Largely influenced by Moynihan's work, Johnson's "Great Society" swelled a small government bureaucracy of 45 domestic social programs to a leviathan of 435 by the end of his administration. Yet for all this "help," things have only gotten worse since then. What can be done?

<td hspace=5>



&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; There are four obvious imperatives for government. First, it should clearly define marriage as a lifelong commitment between a man and woman. Second, states should reform no-fault divorce laws. Third, government should end our confiscatory tax structure, which undermines the financial stability of families. Our tax policy ought not merely level the playing field for married couples; we should actually <i>tilt it in their favor</i>. Fourth, the federal and state governments should reform welfare in order to end current incentives for conceiving children outside of marriage.
</td></tr></table>


	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; But the real recovery of a marriage culture requires tools that the government doesn't possess or even recognize. Our nation needs both a vision for the purpose of marriage and the personal and spiritual resources to build strong unions. These can only be provided by our faith-based institutions, which are divinely commissioned and uniquely gifted to undertake this work. Without this vital contribution, many children will never enjoy the irreplaceable benefits of a home with a mother and a father. Consequently, society will suffer.<p><i>James Dobson, a psychologist, is the founder of Focus on the Family, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.</i><p> 
<a name="engler"><b>Gov. John Engler</b></a><br>
<b><i> Acknowledge the Limits of Government</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government policy should follow the Hippocratic Oath. Government policies should in no way discourage the formation and preservation of families, nor add momentum to the powerful centrifugal forces breaking our families apart. Here are three reforms at the top of my list:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Tax reform. Government must reduce the tax burden on families and eliminate the marriage penalty in the tax code. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, real average weekly wages are 5.5 percent lower today than during the Reagan years. As a result, many families are in debt. Spouses are entering the work force to help make ends meet, and they raise total family income by about one-third. Yet these families must also pay almost 28 percent of their income to the federal government. In effect, mothers are having to work just to pay off Washington.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	It is useful to put the burden on our families in historical perspective. In 1954, the last year Republicans controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, federal taxes amounted to less than the tithe to your local church -- 8 percent of total family income. Often one parent chose not to work. Today, however, few families are free to make that choice, and government tax policy has burdened them unnecessarily.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Welfare Reform. Remember the stories about couples splitting up so welfare benefits would keep coming in? That was due to the "100-hour rule," which kept intact couples from working more than 100 hours per month. Unfortunately, it's still federal law. Michigan was one of the first states to apply for and receive a waiver from the federal government to exempt two-parent families from this destructive policy. The 100-hour rule is just one example of where federal welfare policy is wrong. Until states are free to undertake far-reaching reform, the system will continue to fail families.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Divorce reform. Because of the terrible impact of easy divorce on women and children, state lawmakers are taking a second look at their no-fault laws. In Michigan, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and a half-dozen other states, Republicans and Democrats alike are seeking to make the decision to get divorced a more considered one.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	A national leader in turning back no-fault divorce has been Jessie Dalman, a Michigan state legislator. She has sponsored 12 bills that would deny a divorce if only one spouse wants it -- unless that spouse could prove infidelity, desertion, alcoholism, physical or mental abuse, or other serious problems. Her legislation would also require participation in a pre-divorce program for all parties in an uncontested divorce where young children are involved.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	In addition, Dalman's legislation seeks to reduce the number of impulsive marriages by requiring a 30-day waiting period and encouraging every couple to receive counseling before their wedding day. A state marriage license would cost $20 for those who get counseling, $100 for those who do not.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	It is essential that our society rethink the no-fault revolution. Over the past quarter-century, easy divorce laws have helped tear apart American families. As a society, it is time to refocus more on the needs of children and less on the desires of parents. We must make it harder for children to be victimized by a no-fault system that gives all the legal clout to the party that wants to break the marriage.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	It is essential that Washington acknowledge the limits of government. It never has been, nor will it ever be, a substitute for the family. Family renewal must, in the end, come from within the family. Despite well-publicized divorce statistics, I am hopeful that our nation can slow down the forces of disintegration. The brisk sales of works like <i>The Book of Virtues</i>, the recognition that "Dan Quayle was right," the growing impact of groups like Focus on the Family and Promise Keepers -- all these signs give me encouragement.

<b><i> Praise the Two-Parent Family </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government's first and most immediate task is to stop undermining the two-parent family. Whatever government subsidizes, it will be inundated with. In the 1930s, when government subsidized pigs, the Midwest was up to its hips in pigs. Today, we are subsidizing illegitimate children, and the result is a social catastrophe.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government ought to dismantle every welfare program that promotes single-parent families. The litmus test is simple: Any program that encourages out-of-wedlock births and supplants fathers should be eliminated. Next, government should aggressively <i>promote</i> two-parent families. The Bible says that rulers have been established "for the praise of those who do good" (1 Peter 2:14, NKJV). Here are a few ways government can "praise" the two-parent family:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Make divorce more difficult to obtain. Reduce the tax burden on the family. Defend traditional (one man, one woman) marriage. Uphold parental authority over children. Empower parents with educational choice.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	A century ago, the Supreme Court called the traditional two-parent family "the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble in our civilization; the best guaranty of that reverent morality which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political improvement" (<i>Murphy v. Ramsey</i> [1885]). I pray for leaders at all levels to have the wisdom -- and the courage -- to stand on such principles today.

<b><i> Remove Perverse Incentives </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government must encourage families to come together and stay together through cultural, not governmental, pressures. The most important role for government is to remove the perverse incentives of the welfare state.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Current policy encourages parents to abdicate financial and moral responsibility for their children to the government. Our entitlement system induces some irresponsible fathers to abandon their families, cavalierly confident that government will step in. If we resist the temptation to cure every societal ill with more government programs, I believe parental influence and responsibility will fill the void. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	We must weed out invasive government policies, so that our culture can recuperate. Our current welfare system penalizes marriage and work and fosters dependency, and it must be reformed. We should also eliminate the marriage penalty in the tax code. In addition, we should modernize 60-year-old labor laws to grant working parents the opportunity for flexible work schedules, so that families can spend more time with their children.

<b><i> A Modest Role</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	We should be appropriately modest about the role of government in promoting family stability. Current rates of divorce and out-of-wedlock birth reflect deep cultural changes over which law and public policy have limited influence. Still, there are some responsible steps government at various levels should take.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Reducing out-of-wedlock birth. In the past decade, several promising programs to reduce pregnancy among unmarried young people have been developed at the local level. The federal government should create -- or help the nonprofit sector create -- a clearinghouse to inventory these programs, evaluate them rigorously, and provide reliable information to states, localities, and community-based organizations. Since recent research suggests a connection between the welfare system and out-of-wedlock birth, welfare reform should permit states to adopt new policies that reduce perverse incentives.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Making marriage pay. The federal tax code tilts against families. To correct this, we should dramatically increase the dependent exemption for young children and do what we can to eliminate the marriage penalty. In addition, tax credits for education and training should be made available to parents who leave the paid work force for extended periods to care for young children and then seek to return.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Restricting divorce. States should reshape their laws of divorce to make divorce more difficult when minor children are involved. I favor the elimination of unilateral no-fault in such cases, with the alternative of a five-year waiting period. In addition, as Maggie Gallagher, Elizabeth Scott, and others have suggested, states should stand behind the premarital agreements of couples who wish to make their own marriages harder to dissolve than state law requires.

<b><i> Find the Will </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Can government do anything to reverse the trend of fatherlessness? Yes. Reform no-fault divorce laws, eliminating the right to unilateral divorce on demand. Lengthen waiting periods for divorce. Create financial and other incentives for engaged couples to participate in marriage preparation and for couples with troubled marriages to get counseling.

<td hspace=5>



&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Reform school curricula that trivialize or denigrate marriage. Stop the practice of mainstreaming pregnant girls and teen mothers through the school system. Prohibit boys who impregnate girls from participating in sports and other extracurricular school programs. Enforce statutory rape laws. Put the current welfare system out of its misery and replace it with public and private efforts, including faith-based initiatives, that embody effective compassion and promote marriage.
</td></tr></table>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Eliminate the antimarriage bias in the Earned Income Tax Credit. Increase the value of the marriage deduction in the tax code. Calculate child-oriented tax exemptions and credits on a per-parent basis -- that is, permit households with two parents twice the exemption and credit value of one-parent households.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Give priority to married couples in public housing. Reform adoption laws and procedures so that more children will be adopted, sooner, by married couples. Appoint and hire people who will publicly insist that unwed childbearing is wrong, that our divorce rate is far too high, and that our society should dedicate itself to increasing the proportion of our children who grow up with their two married parents.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	The real question is not whether we know what would work, but whether we want to do what would work.<p><i>David Blankenhorn is the president of the Institute for American Values and the author of </i>Fatherless America<i> (<a href="http://www.harpercollins.com">HarperCollins</a>).</i><p><a name="quayle"><b> Dan Quayle </b></a><br>
<b><i> Preserve, Protect, Defend the Family </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	There is no question government has a role, albeit a minor one, to play in strengthening families. In recent years, the real problem in our society hasn't been so much that families have failed but that government has failed to act in the best interest of families. Some common-sense reforms would do much to correct the government's anti-family bias.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Taxes. The government could and should immediately repeal the marriage penalty, increase the tax exemption for children and index it for inflation, and repeal regulations prohibiting employers from paying "family wages." As a long-term solution, I support a modified flat tax that maintains the deductions for home mortgages and charitable giving.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Divorce. States should reassess their "no-fault" divorce laws, and make children's interests paramount in divorce proceedings.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Welfare. We should scrap our current system, which encourages illegitimacy and discourages work, in favor of new ways to help those truly in need. Senator Dan Coats's "Project for American Renewal" is a good place to start.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Adoption. The House of Representatives has passed reforms removing barriers to interracial adoption and making adoption easier in general. The Senate should pass this bill and send it to the president.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	We also desperately need help from nongovernment institutions like the media and the entertainment community. They have a tremendous influence on our culture and they should join in when it comes to strengthening families. <p><i>Dan Quayle, the 44th vice president of the United States, is the chairman of Campaign America.</i><p><a name="weyrich"><b> Paul M. Weyrich </b></a><br>
<b><i> Reverse an Anti-Marriage Bias </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	In 1987, the Free Congress Foundation pioneered the development of cultural conservatism with a book called <i>Cultural Conservatism: Toward a New National Agenda</i>, by William S. Lind and William H. Marshner. This book suggests that, to strengthen American families, government could:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Raise the personal exemption (for dependents only) to its original, 1948 value, which in today's dollars would be more than $6,000. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Make the child-care credit universal, so parents who care for their own children receive the same benefits as those who send their kids to day care.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Permit employers to offer a "family wage," that is, a higher wage to heads of families. The family wage was a major Victorian reform that was made illegal by a Department of Labor regulation issued in 1966.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Eliminate "no-fault" divorce.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Assign children their own guardian <i>ad litem</i> in any divorce proceeding. The guardian would represent the children's interest in having the parents stay together.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Limit cash welfare benefits to intact families and offer "matching grants" to heads of intact families with full-time jobs whose income is insufficient to support a family.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Fund programs in which volunteers build homes for sale (not rent) to the poor, with the proviso that these homes may only be sold to intact families.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Current government policies reflect a consistent bias against traditional families. The proposals above depend upon the willingness of those who make government policy to favor such families and regard them as essential to the nation's future. In the face of the influence of "political correctness" (which is to say, cultural Marxism) in both political parties, that most basic change will be the most difficult to bring about.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government's first obligation is to do no harm. For 60 years, Big Government has engaged in massive intrusion into the family -- with disastrous consequences. It is time to get out of the way. <p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	What the government should not do has been obvious to conservatives for many years. It should not maintain a tax system that punishes two-parent families and forces both parents to work; it should not grant "no-fault" divorces more readily than drivers' licenses; and it should not maintain a welfare system that rewards illegitimacy and punishes women who get married.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Ronald Reagan used to say that "government does not solve problems; it subsidizes them." Social engineering, whether done by liberals or conservatives, is still social engineering. Imagine the horrific programs the federal bureaucracy would create to "help" the family. First, it would redefine "family," then "mothers," then "fathers." Could they really even settle on a definition of a child? <p><i>Kay James is the dean of the Robertson School of Government at <a href="http://www.regent.edu/">Regent University</a>, in Virginia Beach, Virginia.</i><p>

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Judy Hooper has two passions in life: doughnuts and the <a href="http://www.osha.gov/">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA).Hooper loves doughnuts. That's one of the reasons she opened a bakery in Evanston, Illinois. It's a small shop, bringing in about $50,000 in profits annually. That's not enough to make her rich, but the challenge of running a small business and her talent for baking keep this 35-year-old Chicago native busy.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Ask Hooper about OSHA, however, and her face glazes over with disdain. A 1994 inspection of her 30-person bakery by OSHA officials left Hooper with $13,000 in frivolous fines. Her infractions included a failure to warn employees of the hazards of household dishwashing liquid. To recoup the cost of the fines, she would have to sell 260,000 doughnuts, or 10,400 cakes, or 1,040,000 cookies.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The national news media picked up her story, but OSHA refused to back down. So has Hooper. Though she paid the fine, she hopes to file a class-action suit against the federal agency, and is trying to enlist other OSHA victims to help her cause. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
She will find plenty of recruits. The bakery owner joins millions of women entrepreneurs across the country who are finding out just how intrusive Big Government can be. Indeed, one of the most overlooked issues in this campaign season is how the rising number of women business owners -- a third of all U.S. firms -- are being beaten down by Washington's overbearing laws, inflexible regulations, and arcane tax policies.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	If they mobilized, these women could be a potent force. The National Foundation for Women Business Owners (NFWBO) reports that the number of women-owned businesses in the United States will reach 8 million this year, employing more than 18.5 million people and generating more than $2.28 trillion in gross sales. Over the last nine years, NFWBO estimates, the number of women-owned firms has increased 78 percent. "The growth in the number of women-owned businesses continues to be dramatic across the nation," says Julie R. Weeks, NFWBO's director of research. But <a href="http://www.house.gov/myrick/">Sue Myrick</a>, a first-term Republican congresswoman from North Carolina and a former small-business owner, knows first-hand how Big Government threatens this growth: "Most government-imposed regulations are duplicative, expensive, and time-consuming," she says. "If not checked, regulations can cripple a small-business owner's ability to compete in the marketplace."

<p><b>Attack on Nurses</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Consider Arlene Kaplan's Heart to Home, Inc., a New York company that provides skilled nurses for patients needing home health care. To accommodate their unpredictable hours, Heart to Home hires nurses as independent contractors. That means the nurses pay their own state, federal, and Social Security taxes.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	For the 70 nurses working for Kaplan -- and the thousands of others who labor as independent contractors in health care -- their employment status buys them flexibility. They are free to schedule their work around their families and other commitments, working anywhere from 5-hour to 60-hour weeks as needed. For the home health-care industry, independent contractors deliver affordable, quality care on demand.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	But to the <a href="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/">IRS</a>, the independent contractors who find jobs through Kaplan's company aren't independent enough. Based on a 20-point litmus test, IRS officials determined in a 1990 audit that Heart to Home's nurses legally were not independent contractors, but employees. Kaplan's business was assessed $250,000 in back taxes and fines for misrepresenting her workers to the IRS.
<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3>In the last seven years, the IRS reclassified 439,000 independent contractors as employees and collected more than $750 million in fines</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	According to Sandra Abalos, a CPA, the test is "so vague and so subjective" that even tax law practitioners cannot determine who is an employee and who is an independent contractor. Heart to Home's lawyer Barry Frank believes the IRS is "targeting small businesses" by frequently auditing those who hire independent contractors. In the last seven years, the IRS reclassified 439,000 independent contractors as employees and collected more than $750 million in fines.
</td></tr></table><p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	So far Kaplan's business has accrued $20,000 in legal fees and expects another $40,000 in court costs when she goes up against the IRS later this year. Unlike most people engaged in legal jousting with this federal agency, however, Kaplan is the plaintiff: Through a complicated financial maneuver, she managed to sue the IRS.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"If the government wins, they put me out of business," Kaplan says. "I don't own enough things in this entire world to pay off what they want from me." Even if Kaplan is successful, there is little hope she'll be reimbursed by the IRS for her legal fees. But forcing the agency to retreat would be a moral victory for her, and might make IRS agents a little less eager the next time around. Says Kaplan, "Maybe they will get off someone else's back in this business."<p><b>Tripping up Toddlers</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The IRS, of course, retains no monopoly on crippling regulation. A few years ago, Virginia resident Tanya Wallace started a small business called Toddlin' Time, a playgroup for stay-at-home moms and their kids. When she decided to franchise her idea, however, she ran up against <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) regulations intended for larger companies.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The FTC's "franchise rule" requires all companies, regardless of their size, to meet the same franchising requirements. So Toddlin' Time, which simply brings mothers and children together at dance studios and karate centers to play games, must meet the same auditing requirements as McDonald's, a company with billions of dollars in sales and operating costs, expensive equipment, and trained staff. 
<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3>It's just easier to walk away from the business, says Tanya Wallace, than to deal with all the government regulations</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	With just a few hours a week in administrative work, Toddlin' Time franchise owners can earn around $14,000 per year by enrolling 50 kids for six-week sessions at $36 per child. Wallace sees her idea as an excellent opportunity to combine family and business in a way that "feels comfortable to home-based women." The business gives kids a regular time and place to play together while stay-at-home moms get to know each other. </td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It's an easy concept to market. But FTC franchising rules have stopped Wallace cold. To comply, she had to expend $15,000 in auditing and lawyers' fees just to become a licensed franchiser. But Wallace couldn't pass these high start-up costs along to the moms interested in Toddlin' Time, so she marketed her franchise below cost. That meant selling four franchising chains just to break even. Yet the fees did not end when her start-up was complete. The FTC requires franchise operators to update their financial statements every year and demands yearly audits to verify the changes.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"We're not a big company," Wallace explains. "We can't afford the two or three or four thousand dollars each year to [prepare] FTC financial statements."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	After six years and 10 successful Toddlin' Time franchises, Wallace is putting the brakes on further expansion. She says she simply can't afford the fees and regulations. Despite these setbacks, Wallace has not totally given up on the idea of Toddlin' Time. She is pursuing a consulting practice to spread her idea, though not her logo, to moms around the nation.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"There is little that you can do when you're up against Big Government and government regulations," she says. "It's easier to walk away, unfortunately, than to deal with all the regulations and expectations they have for you."<p><b>The Disablers</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	When it comes to federal regulations like the Americans with Disabilities Act, however, walking away is not an option. Ask Karla Hauk. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	She and her husband and business partner, Richard Hauk, opened a 32-room Days Inn franchise in Wall, South Dakota. That was on July 1, 1993, about six months after the ADA went into effect. They thought they were ready: Following their franchiser-approved plans, they made two of their 32 rooms accessible to handicapped patrons and made the entrance of their motel accessible to wheelchairs. When they opened their doors, they became the first motel in Wall to provide rooms with accommodations for the handicapped.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Their reward? Karla, Richard, their architect, their contractor, and their franchiser all are being sued by the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">U.S. Justice Department</a> for failure to comply with ADA regulations. They are charged with "unlawful discrimination" toward individuals with disabilities.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It all started with a whirlpool. According to the Justice Department's suit, the Hauks' two-story motel became a three-story facility when they installed a whirlpool in the basement. ADA regulations require that their motel have an elevator so that handicapped customers can reach every floor, as well as a ramp leading to the whirlpool. According to Karla Hauk, installing the elevator alone would cost more than $100,000, not including the increase in property taxes. Even if the owners removed the whirlpool and left the basement empty, they would still be required to build an elevator for handicapped access, because the Justice Department has declared the basement "occupiable space."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	In addition to the elevator, the ADA requires the Hauks to widen all of the bathroom doors in the nonhandicapped rooms. "If someone who uses a wheelchair . . . visits another guest in a non-accessible guest room, he or she will not be able even to enter the bathroom in that room," according to the suit.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Changing the building's design after the fact looks nearly impossible. "Structurally we don't know how you can do it," says Hauks' lawyer Kim Ruckdaschel-Haley. "What do you do, just knock the place down and start over?"<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Karla Hauk says she believes there should be provisions for the handicapped, but that "a lot of this is unreasonable." She says if they had known then what they know now, they never would have built the motel. "We wish to God we never had. They will bankrupt us."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Because the Hauks' business is dependent upon the seasonal tourist traffic at nearby Badlands National Park, they bring in profits of only $20,000 to $25,000 a year. "If Karla and Richard have to fight this, they'll have to go out of business," says their lawyer. In addition to substantial costs to comply with the ADA regulations, the co-owners could each be fined $50,000 by the Justice Department. When the ADA went into effect, it was unclear how the law would be implemented, says Ruckdaschel-Haley. "Karla and Richard in good faith thought they were doing everything they could."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	For ADA bureaucrats, it seems, everything is not enough. So says Debbie Shaffer, owner of an interior design firm in Walla Walla, Washington. Shaffer wanted to move her eight-year-old company, DGS Interiors, out of her home and into a downtown storefront to expand her business. The proposed Main Street site consisted of a 1,500 square-foot main floor for retail sales, with a raised mezzanine to serve as both a design studio and an administrative office.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The problem? Contractors familiar with ADA regulations informed Shaffer that she had two options in bringing the bi-level facility up to code: either build an elevator to make the second floor accessible to the handicapped, or illogically and wastefully duplicate the design studio on the showroom floor.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	If a handicapped client wanted a design consultation, Shaffer says, she could easily accommodate their needs by bringing her portable decorating samples down to the lower level. But this was not good enough: According to the ADA, this special treatment would unfairly discriminate against the handicapped.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	To comply with the ADA codes, Shaffer would have to spend $150,000 to install an elevator, build handicapped bathrooms, and widen all of the building entrances and doorways. These costs were in addition to her other remodeling expenses. "I have a great amount of support for people with any kind of disability," she says, having grown up with a sister who is deaf. "But the government steps in and takes it too far."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The results? "As a small business owner, it was black and white," Shaffer explains. "I couldn't afford it." Shaffer believes the downtown location could have increased her business by 50 percent, but because the regulations were "too overwhelming, with too many hoops to jump through," she was forced to scrap her plans to expand.<p><b>Doughnut Holes</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	If the ADA's regulatory reach can be breathtakingly broad and intrusive, its rival in the universe of federal agencies is <a href="http://www.osha.gov/">OSHA</a>. Over the last two fiscal years, OSHA has recorded 234,409 violations and assessed over $158 million in fines.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Responding to complaints by a disgruntled employee, OSHA held a three-hour inspection of Judy's Bakery, the Illinois mom-and-pop operation cited above. Nothing could have prepared Judy Hooper for OSHA's report, which cited her for, among other things:<ol>	<p><li>Failing to have a written "Material Safety Data Sheet" for "hazardous" chemicals used at the bakery. The only chemicals used at Judy's Bakery are household bleach and the sort of pink dishwashing liquid used in many homes. Both "chemicals" have clearly marked warning labels. OSHA was unmoved. Fine: $2,500.	<p><li>Failing to have a written plan for emergencies such as a fire. Hooper's shop, which is on the first floor and has four clearly marked exits, is inspected twice a year by the Evanston fire department. Local fire officials had never found any potential safety problems. Fine: $2,500.	<p><li>Failing to have an accident log on the shop's wall. At the time, her company had never had an accident requiring a workmen's compensation claim. The officials said this was irrelevant and argued that even if the log contained all zeroes (one for each day without accidents), it must still be hung on the wall. Fine: $500.	</ol><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
At her informal settlement hearing with OSHA officials, Hooper was able to negotiate the fines down from $13,000 to $5,450. The catch was that Hooper was required to spend the balance of the fines due--approximately $7,500--on safety and health programs for her employees and to present proof that she had complied. Ironically, none of the citations was related to the employee's complaints, which were found to be baseless.<p><b>The Gentle Scrub Jay</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It was not the safety of employees that concerned the government officials who intruded into Anita Cragg's business, but the safety of the Florida scrub jay.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	 Cragg, the owner and president of Space Coast Management Services, Inc., bought an existing subdivision in Country Cove, Florida, in 1992, with plans to expand and build new homes adjacent the previously developed site. Cragg's permits were in order and some buyers were waiting to build and settle in.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Enter the scrub jay. While surveying for waterline extensions in 1993, officials from the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> (USFWS) noted two jays flying onto Cragg's lots. Under the Endangered Species Act, the scrub jay, a 12-inch-long, blue and gray crested jay, is listed as threatened. The officials claimed that Cragg's planned development posed a potential hazard to land "suitable for occupation by scrub jays" and suspended construction on the site.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	According to Cragg, neither the USFWS, nor an independent environmental engineer hired by Cragg, could locate any scrub jay nests on her property. Her four-person company fought with officials from the USFWS for 18 months. Construction was frozen in the meantime, while Cragg's buyers had to continue paying real-estate taxes on the land.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The Fish and Wildlife Service pushed Cragg into a corner. The agency forced her firm to purchase four acres off-site for every one on-site to compensate for the loss of potential scrub jay habitat. That little bargain cost her more than $100,000. It "didn't really help the scrub jay," she says, "because we really weren't hurting it in the first place."<p><b>An Irresistible Offer</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	From 1964 until 1979, most of the commercial garbage in Seattle was hauled to one landfill located on the Tulalip Indian reservation. The site was closed and cleaned up in 1979, getting a clean bill of health from the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a>. For the next 16 years, there wasn't a whiff of trouble from Seattle's former commercial dump.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	And then the EPA started talkin' trash: In 1995, the agency placed the Tulalip Landfill on the Superfund's National Priority List, a list reserved for the country's most serious hazardous waste sites. EPA Project Manager Cindy Colgate admitted that "sometimes we think a problem is taken care of when it's not."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Apparently, this was one of those times. Superfund legislation allows the EPA to retroactively assess liability for environmental clean-ups. So the agency is asking Seattle's commercial businesses for approximately $40 million to clean up the landfill a second time.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The EPA has made what it calls "settlement offers" to 208 Seattle companies, each of which hauled more than 200 tons of waste to the site. These offers allow companies the chance to "resolve their liability" by making payments of $11,070 to $185,497 to the EPA, according to Colgate. The official insists this "is not a fine," but instead an "agreement between the EPA and the parties which says we won't sue them regarding the site." It also protects the firms from third-party suits. Many attorneys are advising firms to pay the EPA and move on. So far, 187 parties have decided to settle rather than face EPA lawsuits.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	For some women-owned firms, the experience has been a primer on the power of federal agencies to impose their will. One such firm in Seattle, an import-export company whose owners asked not to be identified, agreed to pay their  $11,070 fine. In total, Seattle's business owners are forking over $8,130,610 to the EPA--at least $30 million short of its goal. Suzanne Burke, the president of the Fremont Dock Co., which was not named in the settlement, says she believes the 208 letters are "just the beginning," and fears her company may be next on the list. She says the $40 million Superfund cleanup is "an absolute horror for small businesses."

<p><b>Fighting Back</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	There may be some legislative help on the way for business owners. Congress is seeking to clarify the ambiguity over the tax status of independent contractors versus employees, which bedeviled business owner Arlene Kaplan. Congressman <a href="http://www.house.gov/christensen/welcome.html">Jon Christensen</a>, a Nebraska Republican, is sponsoring a bill to simplify IRS rules for independent contractors. A spokesman for Christensen says the bipartisan bill could pass this year. Oklahoma Republican <a href="http://www.senate.gov/member/ok/nickles/general/">Don Nickles</a> has introduced similar legislation in the Senate because, according to his spokesman, "hassle from the IRS" is the principal complaint from his constituents. 	<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	But as more women start their own businesses, they are becoming more cynical about government's helping hand. Forty-seven percent of the women business owners surveyed in 1995 by the United States Trust Company believed that government policies had made things "a little worse or much worse" for their businesses. When asked to rate specific government policies, almost all of the female respondents (91 percent) said they feel most threatened by government-required paperwork, while 90 percent feel threatened by taxes on businesses, raw materials, final products, or services.

	The bureaucrats contend they're changing the system. Several officials separately claimed OSHA's new and improved agency has purged archaic enforcement procedures, yet all cited the same case to prove their reform: "Instead of fining someone for not hanging one of our posters about workers' rights," they say, "we offer them a poster to hang." While this may be a first step in dismantling the adversarial relationship between employers and OSHA, it demonstrates how federal agencies are not getting the message from business owners across the country. What happens, one might ask, if they don't hang the poster?<p>

	Women business owners are bumping against a ceiling all right. But it isn't made of glass -- it's made of red tape.<p><i>Sheila A.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	California's Yuba County is getting ready to spend $12,000 this November on election materials that nobody will use. That's because the federal government forces local officials to print voting information in Spanish for every election.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Bilingual ballots are an enormous waste of county resources," says Frances Fairey, Yuba County's registrar of voters. In last March's primary election, this county north of Sacramento was forced to spend $17,411 on Spanish-language election materials. But, according to Fairey, "In my 16 years on this job, I have received only one request for Spanish literature from any of my constituents."

<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The biggest problem with bilingual ballots, however, is not that they go unused in Yuba County, but that they are used in so many other places. Thousands of Americans are voting in foreign languages, even though naturalized citizens are required to know English. The National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium estimates, for instance, that 31 percent of Chinese-American voters in New York City and 14 percent in San Francisco used some form of bilingual assistance in the November 1994 elections. Though these figures may be overstated, proportions anywhere near this magnitude are devastating to democracy. As Boston University president John Silber noted in congressional testimony last April, bilingual ballots "impose an unacceptable cost by degrading the very concept of the citizen to that of someone lost in a country whose public discourse is incomprehensible to him."</td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A nation noted for its diversity needs certain instruments of unity to keep the <I>pluribus</I> from overrunning the <I>unum</I>. Our common citizenship is one such tool. Another, equally important, is the English language. It binds our multiethnic, multiracial, and multireligious society together. Not everyone need speak English all of the time, but it must be the <I>lingua franca</I> of civic life. Since the voting booth is one of the vital places in which citizens directly participate in democracy, it must be the official language of the election process.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It is not, however, and political jurisdictions ranging from Yuba County to New York City can pin this mess on the perversion of voting-rights legislation. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 guaranteed blacks the right to vote in places, particularly the South, where they had been systematically blocked from electoral participation, often through the use of bogus "literacy tests." But as Manhattan Institute scholar Abigail Thernstrom has shown in her comprehensive book <I>Whose Votes Count?</I>, it did not take long for this important piece of civil rights legislation to expand in dangerous ways.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After the Act's passage in 1965, civil rights groups toiled to expand its authority. When the law came up for reauthorization in 1975, Hispanic organizations argued that English-language ballots were the equivalent of literacy tests. People whose first language was Spanish needed special protections in order to vote, they claimed, citing low turnout among Hispanics. This was sheer quackery. Literacy tests in the South were used for the fraudulent purpose of keeping blacks away from elections. Low Hispanic turnout was mainly due to the fact that so many Hispanics were not citizens and therefore ineligible to vote.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nevertheless, Congress sided with the activists. It required bilingual ballots in any political district where "language minorities" made up at least 5 percent of the total population and less than half of the district's citizens were either registered to vote or had voted in the 1972 presidential election. It also required that bilingual election materials be made available to voters in every county in which the language-minority population had an "illiteracy rate" -- meaning "failure to complete the 5th grade," a trait that includes many immigrants--above the national average. Interestingly, "language minorities" were not defined by language (a cultural characteristic), but by ancestry (a genetic one). The category included only "persons who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Natives, or of Spanish heritage." French Canadians living in Maine, the inhabitants of Little Italy in New York City, and the Pennsylvania Dutch received no special assistance. By the early 1990s, the foreign-language ballot provisions of federal voting-rights law applied to 68 jurisdictions in the United States.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The bilingual-ballot mandate bloated even further in 1992, when Congress said that counties with more than 10,000 residents who speak the same language and who are not proficient in English must provide bilingual voting ballots, even if their potential users make up less than 5 percent of the overall population. This applied to heavily populated areas with large numbers of non-English-speaking residents, such as Chicago, New York City, and San Francisco. To comply, New York City had to purchase new voting machinery because its old equipment did not have enough space for all the Chinese characters that the law said it must provide. Los Angeles County now offers ballots in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese. In the three elections between November 1993 and November 1994, the county spent more than $1.2 million to print voting materials in these foreign tongues. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund has called this "a particularly small price to pay." This "small price" could have paid for a year's tuition at UCLA for 308 Los Angeles residents.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Ballot initiatives are often worded very precisely. Will translations always convey the exact English-language meaning of every initiative? In a deliberative democracy, they must. On a 1993 New York ballot question, translators printed the Chinese character for "no" where it should have said "yes." More important, immigrant voters should not even need bilingual ballots. We have required naturalization applicants since 1907 to demonstrate English-language proficiency. In order to become citizens -- and thus gain the right to vote -- the foreign-born have to demonstrate the ability to speak, read, and write simple English. A handful of them are granted exemptions. Naturalization applicants who are over the age of 50 and have lived in the United States for 20 years do not have to meet the English requirement. But they only make up about 7 percent of all citizenship applicants. The other 93 percent have to pass the test. So why do we assume they lose their English skills on Election Day? Meanwhile, foreign-language voting sends one more message to immigrants that assimilation is not an important part of civil society.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A popular antidote to bilingual ballots is declaring English the official language of the United States. But that is like declaring the bald eagle its official bird -- it's essentially symbolic. Many self-proclaimed official-English advocates in Congress have no intention of repealing foreign-language ballot laws or federal funding of bilingual education. When Senator <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~stevens/">Ted Stevens</a> of Alaska opened hearings on an official-English bill last December, he proudly announced that "the bill does not affect existing laws which provide bilingual and native language instruction. Those statutes are integral parts of our national language policy." Message to civil rights activists: We're not going to change a thing.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In a speech to the 1995 American Legion convention in Indianapolis, Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole announced that "English must be recognized as America's official language." But he said nothing about bilingual ballots. As a senator in 1992, Dole voted to expand their use.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In August, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would repeal the federal government's unfunded bilingual ballot mandate by amending the Voting Rights Act. It would not deny local communities the right to print non-English voting materials, should they choose to pay for it themselves. Nor would it stop voters from taking punch cards into the election booth. No companion bill, however, has been introduced in the Senate. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is a long tradition in the United States of ethnic newspapers -- often printed in languages other than English -- providing political guidance to their readers in the form of sample ballots and visual aids that explain how to vote. In the absence of bilingual ballots, this practice could continue and expand. Perhaps we should also allow voters to bring a friend or relative into the booth, just as blind voters can do. The polling place would remain open to people who have trouble with English, but it also would remind them that English -- or even broken English -- is the common language of American democracy.

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	A year ago, a 16-year-old constituent of mine, Jeff Gardner, died from a lethal combination of "huffing" gasoline and smoking marijuana. After Jeff's death, his mother, who was aware of a much larger drug problem in the community, called a parent's meeting at the local high school. No one came. She told me her story and asked how her representative in Congress was going to help address the growing drug problem. It was a fair question, but I was not satisfied with the response I could give her. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Members of Congress take seriously their responsibility to represent their constituents in Washington -- by legislating, by voting, and when appropriate, by securing federal funding for state and local concerns. Despite spending $13 billion annually on drug-control programs, however, drug abuse is rising dramatically among our youth.
<p>
<table width="160" align="left" cellpadding="4">

<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>We'll continue to lose the war on drugs until national politicians show local leadership</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A big part of the problem has been the president's failure to show any leadership on this issue (until his wise appointment of General Barry McCaffrey as the new drug czar). In fact, President Clinton hurt the antidrug effort by cutting the Office of National Drug Control Policy from 147 to 25 full-time positions, by hiring a surgeon general who advocated legalization of drugs, by cutting funding for interdiction efforts, and by sending confusing messages about the stigma of illegal drug use. It is no surprise, then, that after dramatic reductions in drug use during the decade before Clinton took office, drug use has nearly doubled among teenagers during his administration. The evidence shows that <i>national leadership</i> is critical in reducing drug abuse.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Jeff's mother wanted that leadership, but in a manner that would help her in Goshen, Ohio. Spending more federal dollars on drug-control programs was unlikely to directly touch this mother's life. Neither would it encourage other parents in her community to address the drug problem. How could I really help? By rolling up my sleeves and providing leadership where it matters most--at the local community level.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Members of Congress are in a unique position to mobilize people in their own communities. By the nature of our jobs, we deal with every sector of the districts we represent. We can also bring statewide and nationwide expertise and resources to bear on a problem. And we can draw the attention of news media that is so critical to educating and mobilizing neighborhoods to solve their toughest social problems. What I've initiated -- and what I'm challenging my colleagues in Congress to embrace -- is a new model of governance that recognizes the limitations of Washington-based solutions, while drawing on the resources of citizens locally.
<p>
<b>Cause for Alarm</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	If there is any public-policy area that demands a new, more effective approach, it is drug abuse. Recent Gallup polls show that crime and drugs are Americans' top concerns. When you ask parents and children what is the most serious issue facing youth today, both groups cite drug abuse.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
National statistics show there is indeed cause for alarm. After a decade of progress in the war on drugs, the number of young people using drugs began to increase in 1992; use among young kids showed the sharpest increase. LSD use is now at its highest level since 1975, when it was first measured. Since 1992, the number of children between 12 and 17 using marijuana has nearly doubled. To put the problem in perspective, in the average class of 25 eighth-graders (13- and 14-year-olds), five are now using marijuana. And drug abuse is implicated in other social problems -- violent crime, dropout rates, and domestic violence, to name a few. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Greater Cincinnati has a drug problem that mirrors the startling national statistics. This region of the country experienced a similar decline in drug use in the 1980s. But by the early 1990s, it began to skyrocket. Why?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I'm convinced that the resurgence stems in part from the disappearance both of effective national leadership in the fight against drug use and of the media attention that usually follows such leadership. This attention is vital to teaching children that drug abuse is both dangerous and wrong.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	No one makes this point more authoritatively than Jim Burke, the chairman of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. It was Burke's group in the 1980s that launched the most extensive and successful public-service campaign in the country. Burke also believes strongly that, while the message must emanate from our national leaders and engage the opinion shapers at every level, this issue is best addressed at the community level.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I decided we could not afford to wait for another tragedy to prompt us to action. Over the last year and a half, I have spearheaded an effort to establish the Coalition for a Drug-Free Greater Cincinnati. This effort is not about flashy press conferences and slick brochures. It's a serious, long-term initiative that brings together for the first time community activists already involved in the antidrug effort, key business figures, religious leaders, the media, parents, young people, law enforcement officials, and others. Our aim is to develop and implement a comprehensive, community-based strategy to reduce drug abuse in our region.
<p>
<b>Mobilizing Citizens</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	How do you start a coalition? First, you do a lot of listening at all levels -- to kids and parents, grass-roots activists, and state and national leaders in the field. Over an 18-month period, we led or helped organize countless meetings in all sorts of settings, from living rooms to classrooms, and from boardrooms to community centers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We made it clear through the amount of time we devoted to the effort--more than 1,000 man-hours over 18 months -- and through our inclusive, nonpartisan approach that this was not about re-election campaigns or shallow publicity. The reaction from the community to this new kind of leadership has so far been very positive. Every television station, every major radio station, the two daily newspapers, and our largest outdoor advertising company are all running antidrug public service announcements and ads. Some of the radio spots are from a popular local rock band. We know that such messages help reduce drug abuse, and Greater Cincinnati now has one of the most aggressive antidrug media campaigns in the country.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Such messages, however, are not enough. The data shows that most people who use drugs go to work every day. Also, work is a good place to find parents who need counsel on dealing with teenage drug use. So we had to engage businesses. We took an idea proposed by one of our national prevention experts and brought it to our coalition in Greater Cincinnati. The result? One of our largest health-care providers and the Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation will offer, for the first time ever, financial discounts to businesses that adopt certified drug-free workplace programs. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The program makes sense. Businesses like it because health-care and workers' compensation coverage costs less. Health-care providers and the bureau like it because drug-free workplace programs do result in a healthier work force and fewer medical and workers' compensation claims. Communities like it because it helps keep workers drug free, encourages drug abusers to seek treatment, and educates people about the dangers of drug abuse. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We also brought PRIDE, a premier national parents' group, to one of our school districts to train more than 600 parents in taking practical steps to keep their kids drug free. This training will be replicated in every school district in the region. Parents are signing up in droves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We mobilized our local clergy to incorporate an antidrug message in their sermons every six months and to follow up with an educational slide presentation that we developed. We have established a speakers' bureau to supplement the D.A.R.E. program in the schools, and to help get the message out in community centers and student clubs. The list of initiatives proposed by the local community, brought to the coalition by state and national leaders, and facilitated by congressional leadership, goes on and on.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In addition, I have brought to Greater Cincinnati national and state prevention experts to bolster the local effort, including the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, and Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education. I have also brought the president's drug czar, Senator Bob Dole, and Speaker Newt Gingrich to Cincinnati to see the coalition's work firsthand.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The public rightly expects the federal government to do something about drug abuse, which diminishes and threatens the lives of so many of our young people. And the federal government clearly has an important role in combating drug abuse: protecting our borders and interdicting drugs from other countries, strengthening our federal criminal-justice system, and providing federal assistance for the best prevention and treatment programs.	
	Despite a significant federal effort, however, our country is still seeing dramatic increases in drug use among our teenagers. In the last t<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
wo years alone, use of illegal drugs has increased 50 percent. We need a new approach.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Many of my colleagues are beginning to agree. At least 15 other members of Congress are establishing, or supporting, similar community coalition efforts in their regions. The entire House of Representatives -- in an unusual show of election-year bipartisanship -- recently endorsed this community-based initiative.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's a much more significant step than cynics imagine. Although the public has become disenchanted with the federal government's ability to address our worst social problems, there's still an abiding faith in a community's ability to fashion solutions close to the needs of ordinary people. And members of Congress can still be a catalyst. Although the public seems to distrust Congress as a whole, individual members are generally well respected in their districts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The point is that members of Congress <i>can</i> and <i>should</i> inspire citizens to action. We've heard about the need to revitalize civil society. Well, here's a concrete example of how members of Congress can do that in a way that actually touches people's lives -- not by passing more laws in Washington, but by using their bully pulpits to engage their communities back home. This is how we as national leaders can best exert--and sustain -- national leadership over the long haul. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And for the sake of the Jeff Gardners in our communities, we'd better get started.

With some 15,000 programs nationwide serving 500,000 people, this is a $3-4 billion industry, funded mostly by federal and state taxpayers. Despite all this money, roughly two-thirds of people with disabilities remain unemployed. Yet, astonishingly, there are no industry-wide measures for judging how well individual programs are doing.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"When you're choosing between different mutual funds, you can compare their performance in Morningstar," says Terry Etling, the CEO of the National Results Council (NRC). "But if you have a disability and want a job, you don't know which rehab programs have the best track record. And if you're a legislator trying to get the most bang from the taxpayers' buck, you don't know which programs to expand or scale down." Etling ought to know. As a former top official at the Ohio Rehabilitation Services Commission, he used to hand out money to service providers.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To fill this void, the NRC will compare every vocational rehabilitation program in the country according to two measures of performance:<ul><p><li>	Four months after graduation, what percentage of participants have been employed for at least 30 days earning at least $180 per week? (For some kinds of programs, the earnings threshold will be lower.)<li>	How much does the program cost per beneficiary?</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The NRC will then rank the programs according to the benefits delivered and the cost per beneficiary. Rank order will be adjusted according to labor market conditions and barriers to employment, so that programs are rewarded for serving consumers with the greatest difficulty finding jobs. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The NRC will test its methodology in a pilot study of 90 rehab programs at Goodwill Industries International. Kenneth Shaw, Goodwill's research director, says his organization has conducted internal studies of its programs, "but we think an independent third-party evaluation will have more credibility."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Shaw thinks the NRC study will help Goodwill do its job better. "We want to know if some of our programs aren't achieving industry standards, and then figure out why," he says. "We also want to identify which of our programs work best, so that we can learn from our own success, and transfer those lessons to our other operations." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	That's exactly what the NRC hopes will happen throughout the rehab industry. Robert Walker, the organization's president, is a program-evaluation specialist who used to run a Minneapolis rehab center. He estimates that the industry could improve its cost-effectiveness by 20 to 25 percent, simply by bringing low performers up to the standards of the best in the business. "For the same amount of money, we could help 25 percent more people get jobs."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The big question is how consumer information will transform the industry. "Simply pointing to models of excellence isn't enough," says Chris Olander, an NRC board member. "We have to change incentives." Olander is the executive director of New York City's JM Foundation, which conducted a seven-year search in the 1980s to identify the nation's most effective vocational rehab programs. "Guess what? The winners were exemplary but nobody cared. Government and private funders didn't reward the best performers, or punish the worst ones. That's because we don't pay for outcomes in this industry, we pay for quantity of services. We have to start paying for results."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After vocational rehab, the NRC's next target for evaluation will be the larger world of employment and training--a $20 billion industry. It is also considering programs for alcohol and drug treatment, mental health, and teen-pregnancy prevention. One issue the NRC may be able to resolve is whether faith-based alcohol and drug addiction programs have much higher success rates than medical therapies or secular counseling programs. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The NRC hopes it can reach five audiences with its information: consumers who can make more informed decisions; service providers who can compare their results with similar programs; government officials who can better direct tax dollars for maximum benefit; researchers and trainers who can help improve programs; and private funders who can invest their charitable contributions for greater impact.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Our mission," says president Robert Walker, "is to help human services achieve higher success rates while reducing costs and serving more people."<p>

<h2>Don't Brake for Big Government</h2>
<b>by Tyce Palmaffy</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
        <font size="+1">I</font>n 1974, in the wake of the OPEC oil embargo, the federal government imposed the 55 mile-per-hour "National Maximum Speed Limit" (NMSL) on American motorists to conserve gas. But long after the fuel crisis had abated, the federal speed limit remained, backed by advocates who touted its supposed safety benefits. Even as these benefits were soon cast into doubt and drivers' compliance with the law began to erode, its supporters continued to lobby for the federal maximum. And for more than 20 years, Congress followed their lead. The Democratic leadership of the Congress blocked all efforts to overturn the national speed limit.
<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">C</font>ongress has finally repealed a law that defied popular will and common sense - the federal speed limit</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5> 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Then last year, with their robust commitment to limiting government, the newly elected House and Senate freshmen pushed for a repeal of the federal speed limit. In the fall of 1995, despite the resistance of old-guard Republicans Bud Shuster and John Chafee, chairmen of the key committees in the House and Senate, legislation repealing the national speed limit passed both chambers by chasmic margins -- 419-7 in the House, by voice vote in the Senate. On November 28, 1995, President Clinton reluctantly signed the legislation. The endurance of this anachronism is but one sign of Washington's bureaucratic paternalism; its demise, however, may augur a new era of limits on federal authority. </td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The federal maximum was not, technically, mandatory. It was enforced through the power of the purse -- federal highway funds were withheld from states refusing to post the new limit. Naturally, every state capitulated. Building on legislation in 1987 and 1991 that allowed states to raise the limit to 65 m.p.h. on rural interstates and freeways designed for high speeds, the repeal removes the threat of reduced funding, freeing all states to set their own speed limits.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Since the repeal, more than 20 states have raised their limits, including seven within a week of the effective date of the repeal. Four of those states -- Oklahoma, Wyoming, Nevada, and Arizona -- posted a top speed of 75 m.p.h., while Montana eliminated its daytime speed limit for passenger vehicles, reverting to its pre-1974 law requiring drivers to maintain a "reasonable and prudent speed." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Once liberated, state legislatures ushered in these increases by lopsided margins. Missouri's House and Senate, for example, voted by 122-34 and 28-2, respectively, to raise the maximum limit to 70 m.p.h. Idaho's lower and upper chambers voted to increase limits by 56-12 and 28-7, respectively. Higher speed limits were voted down in Ohio, Connecticut, Kentucky, Virginia, and Louisiana. That's the beauty of a federal system. States can now set their own speed limits after assessing local conditions; some will increase their limits and some will not.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The swift actions of these legislators were bolstered by the support of motorist advocates. "We believe that the states will do as good a job, or even a better job, at setting and enforcing the limits," says Bill Jackman, a spokesman for the <a href="http://www.aaa.com">American Automobile Association</a>. "In many states the federal limits were really disdained. . . . All of the state departments of transportation are responsible institutions with respectable people working in them. We trust them to do their jobs well." With 39 million members nationwide, AAA represents the interests of almost a quarter of all licensed drivers.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	State traffic engineers and highway patrolmen, whose reputations depend on drivers' safety, added their applause. "Putting the decision up to the individual states was a good idea," says Ken Howes of the Florida Highway Patrol. "Our Florida Department of Transportation has done excellent research on what speeds are appropriate. We are very comfortable in Florida if a speed is raised, because we know it is not done haphazardly." Adds P.D. Kiser, the chief traffic engineer at the Nevada Department of Transportation: "The repeal was way overdue; the 55 m.p.h. speed limit was an experiment that failed miserably."<p><b>Easy Riding</b>	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Patrolmen and engineers supported the repeal because it permits states to set more reasonable and safe speed limits. According to traffic engineers, the proper method of determining speed limits is to measure the speed of traffic under ideal conditions. The limit should be posted at the speed at or below which 85 percent of traffic is traveling. In effect, <i>drivers</i> set the speed limit. What engineers call "the 85th percentile speed" --  the proper speed limit -- is the safest speed to travel. "People who drive at the 85th percentile speed are least likely to be in motor vehicle crashes," explains engineer Tom Hicks, of the Maryland State Highway Administration. "It's the people who drive much slower or faster who are most at risk."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unreasonably low speed limits exacerbate the risk posed by these slower and faster drivers. Says Alan Soltani, the chief traffic engineer at the Oklahoma DOT, "When the 85th percentile speed was at 75 and the speed limit was set at 55, drivers weren't comfortable-some drove at 55, some at 65, some at 75. There was so much variance that accidents increased." When the limit is raised to its proper level, the evidence shows, these dangerous variances in speed start to disappear. Hicks reports that ever since Maryland increased the limit on some roads to 65 m.p.h., "We're seeing more tightening of speeds; the slower drivers are catching up while the faster drivers are slowing down."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	On many highways, the federally mandated 55 and 65 m.p.h. speed limits were unreasonably low -- often 5 or 10, and sometimes 15 m.p.h. below the 85th percentile speed. In Minnesota, engineers report, the 85th percentile speeds were 73 m.p.h. on rural interstates and 69 m.p.h. on urban interstates. In <a href="http://www.mt.gov/">Montana</a>, the 85th percentile speed was 72 m.p.h. In Oklahoma, it was 75. Drivers in essence voted for repeal with their feet -- by pressing down on the accelerator.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Such rampant disregard for the law made the situation even <i>more</i> dangerous. Says Maryland's Hicks, "There are many traffic engineers, myself included, who think that the 55 m.p.h. speed limit caused a degradation of respect for traffic laws and contributed to what we call aggressive driving. For the last five years, everybody has been going 15 to 20 m.p.h. over the speed limit, including the police. It's terribly harmful to have a law and not enforce it."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Efforts to enforce unreasonably low speed limits also unduly influence the effectiveness of police. In 1978, Congress started requiring the states to certify drivers' compliance with the 55 m.p.h. limit or face cuts in their federal highway funds. So highway patrolmen were told to enforce a law that the majority of motorists were breaking and that threatened rather than improved safety. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Indeed, in a 1984 study of the effects of the 55 m.p.h. speed limit, the National Research Council found that 29 percent of highway patrol hours were devoted to rural interstates, where only 9 percent of traffic fatalities occurred. This means more dangerous roads -- undivided country highways, high-speed two-lane roads, and highways running through congested commercial areas -- received less attention. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Charles Lave, an economist at the University of California at Irvine specializing in traffic issues, says that researchers must take into account these changes in police and driver behavior by studying overall fatality rates instead of just rates on the interstates. In his 1992 study, "Did the 65 m.p.h. Speed Limit Save Lives?" he found that the stepped-up enforcement of the 55 m.p.h. speed limit did reduce fatalities on interstates after the national limit was enacted. But, he says, the reduction was illusory. To avoid the extra policing of the interstates, drivers switched to the scenic but more dangerous country roads, thus decreasing both traffic and fatalities on interstates.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	So by requiring states to prove they were enforcing the 55 m.p.h. speed limit, the federal legislation effectively reduced patrol presence on non-interstates while increasing the traffic on these roadways. This substantially endangered safety. Says Jackman of AAA, "People move off and onto interstates depending on the speed; if the speed limit is only 55 or 65, they will move onto a country road that will get them there just as fast. The problem there is that the fatality rate is three times higher when you get off the interstates. Interstates are the safest highways we have." Now that the federal limit has been repealed, states can post more realistic limits that will attract drivers to the safer interstates.<p><b>Straw Men</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The repeal of the federal mandate encourages better use of police resources, greater respect for the law, and safer roads. If one adds overwhelming support from motorists, the state legislatures, the highway patrol, and state departments of transportation, the case for repeal seems airtight. So why the opposition?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Well, they're wrong," scoffs Judie Stone, the president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, an organization funded by insurance companies. "I am not an engineer, but it is just common sense. . . . It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that if you raise speed limits, speeds go up." Higher speeds, Stone contends, mean greater chances of crashing.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Changes like these that increase the severity of injuries mean higher health-care costs, more expensive insurance claims, and higher premiums for everyone," adds Richard Retting, the senior transportation engineer at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These arguments held sway in Congress for 20 years. Safety advocates also often point to statistics that indicate fatalities rose 30 percent in 1987 on roads where the speed limit was increased to 65 m.p.h. This proves, they say, that raising the speed limit costs lives. But Lave's study concluded otherwise. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By concentrating solely on the number of interstate fatalities, Lave says, opponents of repeal fail to account for the safety benefits of setting more reasonable speed limits: police allocate their resources more efficiently and drivers switch to the less dangerous interstates. These benefits can only be accounted for by studying overall fatality rates. Lave calculated that from 1986-88, overall statewide fatality rates actually <i>fell</i> by 3.4 to 5.1 percent in the 40 states that adopted the new 65 m.p.h. maximum.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Moreover, engineering studies by Samuel Tignor, Davey Warren, and Martin Parker for the Federal Highway Administration show that average speeds increase negligibly when highway speed limits are raised. Indeed, Tignor and Warren write, "Raising the speed limit by various amounts up to 15 m.p.h. has little or no effect on speeds over a broad range of road types and speed levels."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This would seem to indicate, as traffic engineers like to say, that motorists tend to ignore posted limits, instead picking a speed at which they feel comfortable. But advocates like Retting and Stone see it differently. "If you let drivers set a speed that is reasonable and prudent, as Montana has," Retting says, "they can't do it." Adds Stone, "Yes, it's true that people were exceeding 55 before, but at least they were staying below 65. Now, with states raising limits to 70 and 75 m.p.h., the percentage of drivers exceeding 70 is going up, average speeds are going up. In Kansas and Missouri, fatalities have gone up."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	True, April 1996 traffic fatalities in Kansas and Missouri <i>did</i> increase 20 and 28 percent, respectively, from the same period last year. But in Missouri, fatalities in May <i>dropped</i> by one from last year. And in Kansas, fatalities rose from 25 in April 1995 (before repeal) to 30 in April 1996 -- but in April 1994, Kansas highways claimed 37 lives under the former speed limit. Since the repeal of the federal limit, troopers and engineers in California, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas report that average speeds have not increased significantly -- 1 to 2 m.p.h. in most states -- and fatalities have actually decreased in some states. Says Kiser of the Nevada DOT: "I think the only thing that really changed out there was the numbers on the signs."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To drivers, though, the changes are far more significant. Under the old federal limits, drivers seldom knew how far over the speed limit they could travel without receiving a ticket. Now, report many patrolmen, the limit is higher but enforcement is stricter. Says Howes of the Florida Highway Patrol, "70 is 70 is 70." Patrolmen can concentrate on ticketing the dangerous drivers -- those traveling over the highway's design speed -- and law-abiding citizens can relax and drive.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"[The police and I] are not adversarial anymore," says Raymond Kasicki, an independent truck owner-operator in Ohio. "Before you looked at them as someone who was out to get you. Now we're both looking for the same thing: people who are driving dangerously."<P><b>The Bureaucratic Disposition</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It is easy to dismiss the repeal of the federal speed limit as token legislation, more of a statement of principle than legislation that improves our standard of living. The benefits, however, are palpable. In the Western states, motorists may drive hundreds of miles on flat roads with no other cars in sight. Why shouldn't they be allowed to pick a speed at which they feel comfortable? Why shouldn't the police be allowed to distribute their resources as they see fit? Why shouldn't state departments of transportation, working with the highway patrol, be allowed to set the speed limit according to local conditions? The repeal allows all of this to happen.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	More importantly, the repeal of the national speed limit may signal new attitudes in Washington. The law was a typical Washingtonian notion: a one-size-fits-all rule that usurped state responsibility. Restoring the states' authority on this issue means trusting them to form safe and responsible policies. Says Soltani of Oklahoma, "I strongly believe that there is no relationship between higher speed limits and higher fatalities. If I did not believe that, I would not have recommended [speed limit increases] to the legislature." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And if we can trust the states in this area, why not others? The repeal recognizes two principles at the core of any argument for limiting the federal government: that federal legislation can be extremely inflexible, and that states will seek to protect their citizens. This renewed faith in local officials and doubts about the wisdom of federal solutions may be a bellwether of further devolution.

<b>Targeting Teen Pregnancy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	In his 1995 State of the Union address, Bill Clinton challenged parents and leaders "from all over the country . . . [to] join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy." A new private, nonpartisan group has emerged to accept that challenge. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy notes that more than 40 percent of American girls become pregnant by age 20, the highest teen pregnancy rate in the industrialized world. Eighty-five percent of these pregnancies, according to the group, are unintended. The premise of the Campaign is that teenage pregnancy contributes mightily to many social problems, that national leaders shy away from declaring that it is wrong, and that initiatives to reduce teen pregnancies are disjointed, little noticed, and poorly supported. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The Campaign's goal is to reduce the U.S. teen pregnancy rate by one-third by 2005. Its strategy is to help organize local coalitions of community-based groups to confront the problem at the local level, prod political leaders to raise the public profile of the issue, evaluate the successes and failures of various teen-pregnancy programs, and enlist the news and entertainment media in the effort to change cultural norms.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Perhaps the most significant feature of the Campaign is its acknowledgment, rare in public policy, that "part of a strategy for reducing teenage pregnancy should be a more overt discussion of religion, culture, and public values." To pursue that goal, the campaign is dedicating one of its four task forces to "religion and public values." This task force is chaired by William Galston, a former domestic policy adviser to President Clinton, and includes Heritage Foundation analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, Mary Rose McGeady of Covenant House, scholar Jean Bethke Elshtain of the University of Chicago Divinity School, and a representative of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, among others. Former New Jersey governor Thomas H. Kean and Urban Institute scholar Isabel Sawhill are the board chairman and president, respectively. The Campaign will accept no government funding.<p><i>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Leading a coalition of scientists, business groups, property-rights advocates, and conservationists, the National Wilderness Institute recently released its "American Conservation Ethic." The document comprises a set of principles for protecting the environment and managing resources without recourse to "old-style environmental thinking" that relied on federal mandates. Sound environmental policy, says executive director Rob Gordon, should enlist "liberty, free markets, property rights, scientific inquiry, technological advancement, and a realistic understanding of the natural world." Among its principles: <ul><p><li>Renewable resources are resilient and can be used and managed wisely;<p><li>Efforts to control pollution should measure both benefits and costs in a scientific fashion;<p><li>Management of natural resources should take into account the conditions of particular situations and sites;<p><li>Public policy should be guided by science;<p><li>The most "promising new opportunities" for conserving and improving the environment lie in protecting private property and "unleashing the creative powers of the free market."</ul><p><i>

<P> <b>School Choice in Milwaukee</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Supporters of school choice generally frame their argument in economic terms. They compare public schools to "monopolies" that can get away with a shoddy "product'' -- substandard education -- because poor parents have nowhere else to go. By giving these "consumers" more educational choices, it is said, vouchers will introduce an element of "competition" into public education, thereby forcing public schools to raise their educational standards or risk losing their "customers."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	In <i>Break These Chains</i>, former presidential speechwriter Daniel McGroarty looks at the school-voucher controversy through the eyes of a journalist, not an economist. He offers a "battlefield account" of the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, which claims to be "the first ever 'voucher' plan, providing public funds for private school choice." In the process, he makes some important modifications to the standard arguments for school choice.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
For example, McGroarty challenges the view that public schools are not responsive to incentives. On the contrary, he argues, the problem is that they're <i>too</i> responsive: "Not only is there no penalty for failure, the objective fact is that <i>poor schools prosper</i>. When funding follows failure, bringing underachieving schools more social workers and school psychologists, special 'stay-in-school' programs, an army of 'at-risk' coordinators and early intervention experts, schools faithfully produce the failure that begets funding. Failure, in this Orwellian inversion, is success. Schools, predictably, sink to the challenge."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	McGroarty also points out that choice in practice is sometimes very different from choice in theory. "At an abstract, theoretical level," he notes, "one can champion freedom of choice and condemn, for example, the faddish focus on multicultural curricula without confronting a simple fact: Some parents, given a choice, will choose multicultural schools." In McGroarty's view, the "Afrocentric focus" of many choice schools constitutes a positive aspect of the school culture. "Voucher advocates," he argues, "must have the courage of their convictions to accept choice in practice."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	For McGroarty, the decisive argument for school choice is not an "economic" one -- promoting competition -- but a moral one: parental empowerment. He quotes the principal of one Milwaukee choice school who, when asked what made her school so special, cited parental involvement. "Choice parents are more active than our tuition parents are," she said. "Choice parents want the opportunity to get involved with their child's education."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	When parents become involved, the results are near-miraculous, as McGroarty demonstrates by comparing the educational effervescence at choice schools like Urban Day School and Messmer High School with the apathy and hopelessness of their public-school counterparts. All these schools are located in the same square mile of Milwaukee's poverty-stricken Near North Side, yet are worlds apart in their ethos and record of achievement.<p>
* Break These Chains: The Battle For School Choice <i>by Daniel McGroarty (Prima Publishing).</i><p><b>Technology and Home-Schooling</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"A concern for independent thought, a longing to strengthen family, and a frustration with the bureaucratic limits of conventional schools" are leading some families to opt for home-schooling, according to Britton Manasco, writing in <i>Reason</i>. "Home schoolers are a statistically small but rapidly growing and increasingly influential force in America. Their numbers have jumped from 15,000 to 20,000 in the late 1970s to perhaps 600,000 today (some estimates put the number above 1 million.) The trend is likely to continue, as new products and institutions develop that make it easier for parents to educate children at home."<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Home-schoolers have a powerful ally in the new information technologies that "make it possible for students to learn at their own pace and in their own way, with the teacher serving as a mentor and an intellectual coach -- guiding, supporting and questioning individual learners. . . . [Information technologies] decentralize learning, no longer tying it to the physical infrastructure and administrative overhead of schools."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Critics of home-schooling argue that "individualized learning" fails to develop social skills such as cooperation, collaboration, and communication, but Manasco disagrees. "No one is arguing that technology be employed to the exclusion of human contact and personal warmth. Individualized learning hardly implies learning in isolation. Communications technologies and networks can enlarge one's set of possible associations and even allow for collaborative learning projects that cannot be replicated in the classroom. In a proper setting, they can help facilitate both individual <i>and</i> interpersonal skills."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Equally important, the new educational technologies will also empower parents. "Whether or not political efforts to encourage taxpayer-funded alternatives to government-run schools ultimately succeed, families already have the option of withdrawing from the educational system. . . . As leaving or supplementing traditional schooling becomes more attractive and less costly, the egalitarian ideology and assembly-line pedagogy that dictate one-size-fits-all education cannot remain unchanged."<p><i>
* <a href="http://www.reasonmag.com/9607/Fe.MANASCO.html">"Special Ed,"</a> by Britton Manasco, </i>Reason, <i>July 1996.</i><p><b>The Catholic School Edge</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Studies have consistently shown that Catholic schools are educating minority students better than their public-school counterparts, despite the fact that per-pupil expenditures in Catholic schools are only one-third those of tax-funded public schools. "Catholic schools succeed where state schools fail," writes Sol Stern, "because they have virtually no central-office bureaucrats telling principals how to do their jobs. In public schools, teachers almost automatically get tenure -- a lifetime job guarantee -- after three years. Most Catholic schools around the country have no tenure system whatsoever. . . . And there is no rigid credentialing system: Principals can select teachers for their talent and commitment."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Given Catholic schools' success in educating minority youth, "you might expect that liberals, self-styled champions of disadvantaged children, would applaud [their] commitment and sacrifice," writes Stern. "You might even expect them to look for ways to get government money to these underfunded schools. Instead, they have done their best to make sure the wall of separation between church and state remains impenetrable. Liberal child-advocacy groups tout an endless array of 'prevention programs' that are supposed to inoculate inner-city children against delinquency, dropping out of school and teen pregnancy -- yet they consistently ignore Catholic schools, which nearly always succeed in preventing these pathologies."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Stern attributes the lack of liberal interest in Catholic schools to the fact that liberal opinion leaders are closely allied to the teachers' unions, "which have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of liberal candidates around the country." As a result, we are ignoring an inspiring laboratory of reform. "Catholic schools are a valuable public resource not merely because they so profoundly benefit the children who enroll in them. They also challenge the public school monopoly, constantly reminding us that the neediest kids are educable and that spending extravagant sums of money isn't the answer."<p><i>

<b>Age Will Be Served</b>	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
According to economist Thomas J. DiLorenzo, "establishment seniors groups" like the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC), and the National Council on Aging (NCOA) are little more than tax-supported advocates for Big Government. "They have a vested stake in maintaining the status quo," he writes in a <a href="http://www.capitalresearch.org/crc/books/elderly.html">new book</a> published by the <a href="http://www.capitalresearch.org/">Capital Research Center</a>, "even if it leads to the bankruptcy of programs that seniors depend on." As Baby Boomers age, two programs of critical importance to senior Americans -- Social Security and Medicare -- are certain to suffer financial collapse in the near future unless they are reformed now. Yet the "dependency lobby," as DiLorenzo calls the AARP, NCSC, and NCOA, steadfastly opposes needed changes.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	According to DiLorenzo, the AARP is "the nation's second-largest nonprofit organization after the Catholic Church. It is perhaps the most influential political organization in America, devoting vast resources in efforts to expand welfare and entitlement programs for seniors. AARP has supported a higher minimum wage, more rent control, 'motor-voter' legislation, higher gasoline taxes, higher alcohol and tobacco taxes and higher capital gains taxes." AARP "continues to assure its members that the Social Security system is financially sound," and its lobbying for higher Medicare and Medicaid spending "has helped bring these programs to the point of bankruptcy." About a quarter of its revenues come from federal funding.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The NCSC, which in 1993 received 96 percent of its funding from federal revenues, supports "income tax increases, cuts in defense spending, 'motor-voter' legislation, a national health-care plan including long-term care, more government housing, and expanded government programs for seniors." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	In contrast to these groups, DiLorenzo reports that millions of seniors are joining "a new generation of seniors groups that emphasize voluntarism, consumer choice, and fiscal responsibility. They understand that the welfare-state policies championed by the groups comprising the so-called dependency lobby are as harmful to seniors as they are to younger Americans." Although the combined budget of these organizations -- The Seniors Coalition, the United Seniors Association (U.S.A.) and the 60 Plus Association -- is about $20 million, compared to the $450 million budget of the "Big Three" seniors groups, the influence of pro-market seniors groups is growing. Unlike their counterparts in the "dependency lobby," notes DiLorenzo, these new seniors groups recognize that Social Security and Medicare are in trouble, and favor market-oriented reforms to avert a crisis.<p>

<p><b>The Crisis of Fatherlessness</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"If present trends continue," writes David Popenoe, a professor of sociology at Rutgers University, "the percentage of American children living apart from their biological fathers will reach 50 percent early in the next century." This "massive erosion of fatherhood contributes mightily to many of the major social problems of our time. . . . Fatherless children have a risk factor of two to three times that of fathered children for a wide range of negative outcomes, including dropping out of high school, giving birth as a teenager, and becoming a juvenile delinquent."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	In his new book, <i>Life Without Father</i>, Popenoe attributes the erosion of fatherhood to two causes: the "divorce revolution" and the sharp increase in nonmarital births. These two trends, in turn, reflect a dramatic change in American culture over the past 30 years -- a shift away from any sense of communal responsibility towards a radical individualism.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Until quite recently, Popenoe argues, American individualism was "tempered by a strong belief in the sanctity and importance of social units such as families, neighborhoods, schools, religious organizations, local communities, and the nation as a whole."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	But today's "radical, expressive, or unencumbered individualism is devoted much more to self-aggrandizement at the expense of the group. In place of group purposes serving as personal goals, self-expression, sexual freedom, and even impulsiveness have been substituted. . . . No longer having a strong institutional repository, moral authority has become increasingly centered within the psyche of each individual. At the extreme, we are becoming a nation of asocial hedonists and narcissists."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The crisis of fatherhood, then, is ultimately a cultural crisis, a sharp decline in the traditional sense of communal responsibility. It therefore follows that to rescue the endangered institution of fatherhood, we must regain our sense of community. Popenoe offers several "community-building guidelines designed to promote marriage and family life." These include the fostering of "residential stability," the revitalization of "community moral standards," the "development of smaller cities and towns," and the protection and promotion of "family-oriented neighborhoods." "Without violating the Bill of Rights," Popenoe concludes, "local communities should have more autonomy in establishing and enforcing their own values and moral standards," and "homogenous neighborhoods made up of families with children, possibly up to the size necessary to support neighborhood schools, should be protected and encouraged."<p>

        <font size="+1">T</font>he 288 most dangerous convicts in Maryland are incarcerated in "Supermax," the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Supermax is a prisoners' prison, one in a growing class of "supermaximum security" facilities that take the worst of the worst--murderers and rapists who have continued their violent behavior while on the inside -- and lock them away in a redoubt of fortified walls and high-technology surveillance equipment. Supermaxes exist to isolate "bad" prisoners from the general population, and in turn, these incorrigibles from each other.<p>

<td hspace=5> 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While some see supermaxes as civilized society's last line of defense against its most violent predators, others see them as cruel and unusual punishment. This latter group includes the ACLU's National Prison Project, the National Campaign to Stop Control Unit Prisons, and, most recently, the Clinton <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov">Justice Department</a>. 
</td></tr></table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Deval Patrick, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, has threatened to sue Maryland for alleged violations of prisoners' civil rights at Supermax. Maryland officials vehemently deny the charges. The Clinton administration, they claim, is conducting a quiet campaign on behalf of prisoners that belies its tough-on-crime rhetoric. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even as President Clinton proposes a constitutional amendment to protect the rights of crime victims, these officials charge, his Justice Department is trying to expand the rights of prisoners by singling out Supermax. And although the president has signed legislation to liberate state prisons from activist federal judges and groundless prisoner lawsuits, his political appointees are attempting to micromanage the incarceration of the states' most dangerous convicts. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Rico Marzano is one such convict. In a 1987 drug deal that went bad, Marzano shot and killed four people, including two pregnant women. He was convicted of first-degree murder and placed in a maximum security facility. After his second escape attempt, he was sent to Supermax.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maryland's highest security prison houses three kinds of inmates: "serious institutional rule violators" (typically inmates who have assaulted or killed guards or other inmates); serious escape risks, like Marzano; and prisoners awaiting death sentences, like Anthony Brandison, who paid a man $9,000 to kill two witnesses scheduled to testify against him in a 1983 federal drug case. In all, 105 murderers and 19 rapists spend their days in Supermax in what the corrections system calls "restricted confinement."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Inmates remain alone 23 hours a day in their 65-square-foot concrete cells. They are allowed no physical contact with other prisoners or guards; meals are passed through a narrow slit -- a "beanhole" -- in solid metal cell doors. Out-of-cell time is spent alone, in a windowless prison dayroom. "When we were letting them rec [recreate] together they were killing each other, so we had to stop," said William Sondervan, Maryland's assistant commissioner for security operations.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite such concern for the safety of inmates -- not to mention the prison staff -- the Clinton Justice Department insists that the isolation of inmates at Supermax is "the mental equivalent of putting an asthmatic in a place with little air to breathe." But the staff must maintain order among prisoners who regularly hurl "correctional cocktails" of feces, urine, and other bodily fluids and often have to be forcibly removed from their cells. It is obviously frustrating, then, that prison officials must also fight a legal battle to protect what they see as a valuable -- and legal -- correctional tool. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Each year, the 50 states spend $81 million defending themselves against prisoner lawsuits seeking redress for civil rights "violations" ranging from insufficiently stylish footwear to faulty television reception. This epidemic of prisoner litigation -- one-fourth of the civil cases filed in federal trial courts last year were initiated by prisoners -- is complemented by federal judges who impose "voluntary" consent decrees on states. In 1990, more than 1,200 state prisons were operating under judicial edicts covering everything from inmate population caps to how many electrical outlets each cell must have. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This litigation explosion has greatly circumscribed the control of states over their own prison systems. Some states have passed legislation curbing prisoner lawsuits, but attorneys general from Tallahassee to Phoenix have looked to Congress for federal relief. Congress responded earlier this year by passing the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:S.866:">Prison Litigation Reform Act</a>. The legislation, which forces prisoners to pick up the tab for lawsuits and limits the ability of judges to impose consent decrees, was signed by Clinton as part of a larger spending bill last April. But the ink had barely dried on Clinton's signature before his Justice Department stepped in to substitute for the liberal federal judges  whose meddling in state prison systems had been curtailed by the legislation. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In a 13-page letter to Maryland governor Parris Glendening, Deval Patrick charged that Supermax was violating inmates' constitutional rights through a range of offenses from inadequate exercise equipment to lukewarm meals. He gave the state 49 days to comply with a three-page list of "necessary remedial measures," or else face a federal lawsuit. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Thirty states, the federal government, and Canada all have supermaxes -- one-third of which have been created since 1991. These facilities have already established a track record of success as pressure-release valves for overburdened state prison systems. In the 1970s, before California built its supermax, one out of every 1,200 prisoners was murdered by a fellow inmate. Today, that rate has shrunk by tenfold, to one in 12,000. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Tom Coughlin, a former New York State Corrections Commissioner, says he saw a "dramatic reduction" in violence in his prisons following the construction of the New York supermax a decade ago. Despite their success -- or perhaps because of it -- supermaxes have become the target, many corrections officials believe, of a systematic bias within the Department of Justice. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maryland prison commissioner Sondervan says he is  "shocked" and "insulted" by the charges leveled against Supermax by Patrick. Department of Justice investigators, he believes, came into the facility with their minds already made up. "They came in with a political agenda," Sondervan says. "Their charges don't reflect the truth" about conditions at the prison. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Prisoner litigation typically germinates in the expansive environs of the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits "cruel and unusual punishment." Federal civil rights investigators, Maryland officials charge, seem to believe that supermaximum facilities by their very existence are cruel and unusual. In his letter to Glendening, Patrick admitted he was "unable to find evidence of a pattern of physical abuse by Supermax staff against inmates." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What he did find, however, was a host of violations of prisoners' "rights." Among them were the "rights" to outdoor exercise, piping hot meals, and daily visits by medical personnel. In a sharply worded rejoinder, the Maryland attorney general's office told Patrick that his charges reflect his civil rights division's "philosophical opposition to 'super maximum' facilities without regard to constitutional criteria." They noted that the law allows the Department of Justice to redress only "egregious" constitutional violations, a standard, they argued, that was not met by the charges leveled by Patrick. Former New York prisons commissioner Coughlin agrees that the Justice Department too often acts without legal cause. "Look up the word 'egregious' and the meaning is not lukewarm food," says Coughlin. "There is no constitutional right to rehabilitation. You have to protect people from harm -- that's the constitutional right. The Department of Justice says isolating prisoners is causing harm. But as far as I'm concerned, if officers are not hitting individuals with sticks, there is no constitutional harm being done." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maryland officials suspected Department of Justice investigators of a broader political agenda because Patrick's letter referred to Pelican Bay prison, a notorious facility in California that has been referred to as a "neo-Orwellian hell." Conditions at Supermax, Patrick wrote, were "similar" to those found at Pelican Bay, a supermax that had been the object of a huge 1991 class-action suit alleging physical and mental abuse of prisoners. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maryland officials believe that the Department of Justice has set out to expand prisoners' rights by building on the case law established by Pelican Bay litigation. A federal judge found extensive abuses at that prison and ruled that the severe isolation of inmates there could exacerbate and even cause psychosis and other mental problems. Maryland officials strenuously object to the comparison. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the state's Democratic lieutenant governor, told the <i>Baltimore Sun</i> that it was "outrageous" and "inflammatory" to compare Supermax with Pelican Bay. "The fact that they have to reach so far to make the comparison makes you suspicious of the people who wrote this," she said of the Justice Department report.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Such an agenda, officials admit, is perplexing given the anticrime sentiment prevalent this election year. And the timing of the investigation of Supermax -- coincident with the president's approval of the Prison Litigation Reform Act -- only muddies the Clinton administration's message on criminal-justice issues. "Deval Patrick has painted himself into a box on this one," a Maryland prison official says. "The Prison Litigation Reform Act really captures the national view of how people feel about prisons." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Meanwhile, Maryland corrections officials remain in a tense standoff with federal officials over the future of Supermax. Unfortunately, they can't look to the Prison Litigation Reform Act for relief; it spares states the tyranny of liberal federal judges and litigious inmates, but not federal regulators.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<a href="http://www.senate.gov/~hatch/">Senator Orrin Hatch</a>, one of the authors of the Act, recently decided to try the direct approach: He appealed to the Clinton administration to drop its insistence that inmates at Supermax have a constitutional right to fresh air. "Many, if not all, of the murderers in this group are lucky to be breathing indoor air at all," the senator says, "which is more than their victims are doing right now."

<h2>A Solution Waiting to be Adopted</h2>
<b>by Charmaine Crouse Yoest</b>

</center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
        <font size="+1">W</font>hen 48-year-old Hillary Rodham Clinton confessed to <i>Time</i> magazine recently that she wanted to adopt a child, it set off a small tempest of controversy. Her comment was hailed by supporters as evidence of her bona fides as a child advocate and decried by detractors as yet another reincarnation of the First Lady as First Mother. Some dismissed the remark as an effort to minimize the fallout from her husband's veto of the bill to ban partial-birth abortions. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Interpretations aside, the incident highlights the unique position adoption occupies in our political firmament. Although many in the adoption community wish it were otherwise, adoption is closely tied to the abortion question. And as abortion politics grow more heated, adoption demands attention as the nearest thing to middle ground in a polarizing issue.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But adoption is enmeshed in politics of its own. It continues to suffer from the controversy over transracial placements and from the bureaucratic delays of the foster-care system. President Clinton, for example, says he will support a House bill that would prohibit states from denying adoptions based on race, but the proposal faces intense opposition from special interest groups attached to the Democratic Party. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This complex issue has two sides: infant adoption and adoption out of foster care. For many years now, only 1 to 2 percent of women faced with unwanted pregnancies have made adoption plans. At the same time, the number of couples waiting to adopt is usually estimated at around 2 million. The tragic paradox is that while many families desperately wait for children, many children wait for families. According to the Institute for Children, state welfare agencies have adoption plans for 100,000 foster-care children nationwide, and 50,000 are legally free to be adopted but are languishing in foster care.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The National Association of Black Social Workers has for years decried adoption of black infants by white families as "racial genocide." Accepted social-work practice holds that a child be held in foster care until an "appropriate" -- read "racially correct" -- family is found. This sometimes occurs even when a white family is waiting to adopt a particular minority child. In theory, race-matching of infants and adoptive parents makes sense; in practice, it means that minority children in some states typically wait two to three years longer for new homes than white children.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Meanwhile, children are often trapped in foster care by the false hopes of the "family preservation" philosophy. With misguided compassion, social workers and judges work to preserve families broken apart by drug addiction and physical abuse, when the children need loving, stable homes. Moreover, the foster-care system is sustained by monetary incentives to keep children in care: Federal money comes into the system based on each day a child stays in foster care. The hurdles to get a child into a permanent adoptive home are high, while the incentives are low. As a result, children can drift in the system for years, waiting for the elusive "family reunification."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Eva is one of those children. She last saw her biological mother 10 years ago, when she was eight. Her biological father is not involved in her life in any way. But 1996 was a year of exciting milestones for Eva. She graduated from high school, and a court finally approved her adoption by her long-term foster parents. It took the law a long time to sanction the family they'd already formed--eight and a half years ago.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why the delay? Eva's biological father refused to consent to the adoption. Eva wants her story told because it isn't over. Her two younger brothers have been living in a residential placement center for nearly nine years, even though her new family would like to adopt them as well. Compassion and common sense say yes; red tape says no. Eva's story is much too common. The time that children spend in foster care before their situations are resolved can be excruciatingly long. Ten percent of children in foster care stay more than 7.4 years. And the number of children in state care keeps increasing. Between 1982 and 1992, the number rose 69 percent, from 262,000 children to 442,000.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Behind the statistics are thousands of Evas yearning for homes. Fortunately, reform is in the air. Frustration with lengthy stays in foster care, rising incidents of child abuse, and concern over persistently high abortion rates are helping to focus renewed attention on adoption. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Various efforts -- by private groups, state governments, and Congress--aim to reform the system to let needy children connect with a loving family. The following are some recent initiatives:<p><b>The Texas Model</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Texas governor George W. Bush presides over one of 10 states in which 75 percent of the nation's foster-care population resides. Texas currently has 12,000 children in foster care, of whom 1,400 are available for adoption. But even the children ready for permanent homes may face a long journey: It usually takes the state two years after termination of parental rights to place these children in permanent adoptive homes. Most important from a child's view, foster care itself is a pretty bumpy ride: children average four different placements before they get a permanent adoption.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The 1996 annual report of the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services found that, since 1991, the average length of stay for children who were ultimately adopted was 40.8 months. It took 15 months to terminate parental rights after entering foster care, another 18 months to be placed for adoption, and another seven months to finalize the adoption.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	Bush wants to cut the time kids spend in foster care in half, and has established the Governor's Committee to Promote Adoption to help make Texas a model of adoption reform. The 13-person committee includes several adoptive parents, pastors, and representatives of private adoption efforts such as One Church and One Child. It is due to hand the governor a report in September identifying state policies that hinder adoption. State adoptions, for example, are subject to challenge up to two years after the finalization of the adoption decree -- leaving families and children in a legal limbo.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	So far the committee has targeted two areas for reform: judicial and administrative. Beverly Jimmerson,  Policy Advisor to the governor, notes that courts waste a lot of time when they fail to schedule prompt hearings concerning a child's adoption status. In addition, the committee has discovered that state agencies providing social services to adults fail to prioritize parents who need mental services or addiction treatment. Parents may wait months, or even years, for treatment while their children languish in foster care. The committee's goal is to propose a legislative reform agenda for the 1997 legislative session. <p><b>Kids and the Race Card</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A significant reason for adoption delays in Texas and other states is the ongoing debate over leaving minority children in foster care until suitable minority parents can adopt them -- even though white families are willing and able to take the children in. That battle is now being waged in Washington in the form of the Adoption Promotion and Stability Act. The bill, which passed the House and remains in Senate committee, proposes three significant policy changes:
<ul><li><b>	Give a $5,000 tax credit to middle-class families that adopt children.</b> The bill provides a tax credit for families with income under $75,000 to offset their expenses in adoption. Agency fees, court costs, and attorney fees can create an insurmountable hurdle for many families that might otherwise be able to adopt.<p>
<li><b>	Prohibit the practice of denying adoptions based on race.</b> The goal is to stop state agencies from using racial considerations to delay or prevent adoption of children under their care. In 1994, former senator Howard Metzenbaum shepherded to passage the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to eliminate racial barriers to adoption. In designing regulations to implement the bill, the Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Donna Shalala essentially nullified its race-neutral intent.<p>
<li><b>	Amend the Indian Child Welfare Act to prevent tribes from nullifying adoptions.</b> The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), a federal law passed in 1978, grants Indian tribes the legal standing to contest the adoption of any baby with any Indian ancestry. At the time, the law was necessary to halt unethical adoption practices that preyed on Indian babies. But the act, which assigned the tribe a legal interest in the child "on a parity with the interest of the parents," has strayed into reverse racism. 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A current Ohio adoption case illustrates how convoluted and damaging this mindset can be. The Rost family adopted two twin girls. Subsequently, the birth-grandmother decided she wanted the babies. Grandparents do not have standing to contest an adoption; under the ICWA, Indian tribes do. The grandmother then retroactively enrolled herself, her son, and the twins in the Pomo Tribe of California. The tribe is now contesting the adoption on the grounds that three of the twins' 32 great-great-great-grandparents were Pomo Indian. Courts have previously decided that as little as one-256th of Indian blood (that's one great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparent) qualifies a case for consideration under the ICWA.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The ramifications for adoption could be enormous. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado informed the Senate Indian Affairs Committee that, although there are just over a million people officially enrolled in tribes, at least 15 million Americans can claim Indian ancestry. Echoing the National Association of Black Social Workers, Congressman Don Young of Arkansas told the committee that adoption of Indian children outside the tribe amounted to "a form of brain drain and genocide." While adults argue over rights and racism, children are the ones who wait and suffer.<P>

<b>Casey Goes to Bat for Kids</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A new private project to promote both infant adoption and adoption out of foster care is the Fund for the American Family, founded last summer by former Pennsylvania governor Robert Casey. A prominent pro-life Democrat, Casey is marshaling his political clout to raise the profile of adoption, which he believes is a cornerstone in rebuilding the American family. He is lobbying heavily on adoption reform and recently testified before Congress in support of the adoption tax credit.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Making adoption a national priority is one of the group's top four projects. It has already sponsored two adoption summits, bringing together leading experts to discuss ways of breaking down the barriers to adoption. Casey expects to publish a set of reform proposals this fall to spur state and federal officials to reform the system.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Our goal is to see 100,000 adoptions each year for the next five years," up from 50,000, says Chris Casey, the executive director of the fund. To realize this goal, Casey is trying to bring together all 50 governors for a summit similar to the 1989 governor's conference on education.

<b>A Memo for Reform </b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In 1993, the Cambridge-based Institute for Children began Assignment Adoption to change foster-care and adoption practices in all 50 states. In the first 12 months after Massachusetts governor William Weld signed on to the initiative, adoptions from foster care increased by about 47 percent. The Institute is now working with Texas governor George Bush and recommended to his Adoption Committee the following plan for reform:<p>1. Make foster care a truly temporary form of caring for vulnerable children; enact policies and practices that have as their goal a 12-month maximum stay for children in substitute care. <p>2. Grant biological parents no more than 12 months to prove their fitness to resume custody of their children.<p>3. Give biological fathers 30 days from the birth of the child to formalize paternity, or forfeit the right to contest adoption.<p>4. Prohibit any race-based delays in adoption.<p>5. Terminate parental rights for abandoned children after 30 days, and allow them to be adopted through a private agency--without placement in long-term foster care.<p>6. Find adoptive homes for children within 30 days after the termination of parental rights or contract the process out to a private agency.<p>7. Make entrance requirements for foster families as stringent as those for adoptive families.<p>8. Hold the state Department of Human Services accountable for reporting its progress in finding homes for children in foster care.<p>9. Encourage private-sector involvement in improving components of the substitute-care system.

<h2>Who Owns the Sidewalks?</h2>
<b>Stephen Goldsmith</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
        <font size="+1">I</font>t does not take a legal scholar to recognize that transferring authority to the federal government undermines the whole constitutional structure designed by our Founders. Few realize that this shift is also destroying local self-government in towns and cities all across America.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Ours is a national government whose only powers are those delegated to it by the people. These powers are enumerated and therefore limited by the Constitution, the <a href="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/const/bor.html">Tenth Amendment</a> of which specifies that "the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the People." Jefferson called the doctrine of reserved powers "the foundation of the Constitution" and said that "to take a single step beyond the boundaries thus specially drawn . . . is to take possession of a boundless field of power, no longer susceptible of any definition." The resulting federalist system meant that most political activity in America would occur at the local and state level, rather than at the federal level. <p><table width="160" align="left" cellpadding="4">

<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Today, of course, the opposite is true. Over the course of the 20th century, the federal government has vastly grown in size and power. This expansion occurred largely because Congress, with the acquiescence of the Supreme Court, has long acted beyond its authority and outside the limited powers granted to it. The Tenth Amendment has become, in the eyes of the Supreme Court at least, "but a truism."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But my complaints are more practical than theoretical. Never before have local authorities exercised less control over local life. Federal judges run our jails, bus our children, manage our schools, determine the rights of municipal employees, detail the conditions under which art can be displayed on city property, and the list goes on. The weakening of the Tenth Amendment directly and unduly circumscribes my authority, as the mayor of a large American city, to perform my legitimate duties. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Several recent statutes, in my opinion, are in clear violation of the Tenth Amendment. Consider the Americans with Disabilities Act. Although it was passed with good intentions, the ADA mandates compliance with some of the most minutely detailed specifications ever issued by Congress. Under this statute, we are now negotiating with the Justice Department the precise angle of slope on sidewalk ramps we want to construct for the wheelchair-bound. If we don't even control our sidewalks anymore, what exactly is left of local authority? What Congress views as "good deeds" often undermine both the principles of federalism and the value inherent in a government that is close to the voter. By mandating another set of federal laws, the much heralded Motor Voter Act denies states and local authorities discretion in how best to register their own voters. And it all but orders the use of local tax dollars to achieve this federal objective.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Perhaps the most pestiferous offender is the federal judiciary itself. A recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling had the effect of extending the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to state and local governments. This decision raised eyebrows among even the most liberal interpreters of constitutional law. FLSA rates do little more than "protect" our cities' strongest unions by mandating generous overtime rates and work weeks. (I was recently sued by a police captain I had prosecuted for theft back when I was the D.A.; he argued that his punishment entitled him to overtime pay.) The practical effect of this ruling is that nonfederal units of government must negotiate employee compensation and overtime rates in the fashion that Congress demands--however minute the level of detail.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	American tax policy is being increasingly decided by unelected federal judges, rather than by elected local representatives. By delving even deeper in state and local matters, federal courts are increasingly mandating nonfederal tax hikes by requiring things like new prison construction or huge property-tax increases to pay for federal social experiments like forced busing. The first time an unelected authority in a faraway place imposed taxation without representation on this country, our forefathers declared independence from England.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Yet, despite our best chance in a generation to right this constitutional wrong, conservatives have focused their collective energies on preventing unfunded mandates. Although unfunded mandates allow Congress to avoid tough decisions, this crusade misses the point. Let's concentrate on reducing the federal government, not making sure its excesses are well funded.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Disregard for the Tenth Amendment endangers the very notion upon which the whole American experiment is based. If the design of the Framers is to survive into the next century -- if local authority is to be preserved in the face of an ever-expanding national government -- the federal government's focus must be readjusted to concentrate on its national role and purpose. Weaving the limited government principles of the Tenth Amendment back into the basic fabric of American politics is a good place to start.

<a href="fyi63_3.gif">Chart 3</a>: States With More Than 50% Increase in Medicaid Payments Supported by Their Own State Revenue, 1990-2002<br><p>
While attention recently has focused on the problems of the Medicare system, Congress shortly will try to tackle another health care financial time bomb in the form of Medicaid, the health care program serving the nation's poor. If significant reforms are not enacted, states will face a heavy increase in spending and a rise in the proportion of their projected revenues that must be dedicated to Medicaid. And because the rate of growth in state Medicaid spending will exceed the rate for total state spending, states will be forced either to increase taxes or to divert money from other programs.
<p>
Medicaid is a state-administered program that operates under federal guidelines. Federal and state governments jointly fund the program. Federal reimbursement to the states is based on a statutory formula designed to give a higher matching rate to states with lower per capita incomes. Matching rates for these services range from 50 percent to 83 percent and are adjusted annually.
<p>
	The cost of Medicaid to the federal government has been growing at double-digit rates in recent years. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that annual federal Medicaid costs will almost double by 2002.
<p>
	Although the financial impact on the federal government under current law is alarming, the future impact on states could be even more severe:  a remorseless growth in the share of their own projected revenues going to Medicaid. States can make some cost-saving reforms in the program, but only subject to federal rules requiring that certain levels of coverage be provided to certain populations.
<p>
	To examine the probable future budget impact on states, The Heritage Foundation analyzed the likely trend using certain assumptions to forecast the state share of Medicaid payments for the period 1995 through 2002. First, the Heritage analysis assumes no change in the current Medicaid program. Hence, the following charts and tables project the future state-level Medicaid burden if Congress does nothing to reform this program. Second, where possible, a state's Medicaid spending trend is adjusted by expected changes in state economic activity, by forecasted changes in the eligible population, and by the trend in federal Medicaid transfers to the state.
<p>
	The forecasts for future state Medicaid spending were prepared jointly by Heritage and by Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates (WEFA), a nationally known economic consulting firm that maintains detailed models for each state. For 47 states, WEFA found a significant relationship between historical Medicaid spending changes and fluctuations in the state's economic activity and Medicaid-eligible population. In four cases, however, the relationship was sufficiently weak that WEFA simply projected the historical trend in spending; these are identified with an asterisk on <a href="fyi63_1.gif">Table 1</a>. This table shows the additional state revenues or program cuts needed if the states are to meet their projected Medicaid expeditures.
<P>

Highlights
<p>
	Between 1995 and 2002, if no reforms are enacted, states will have to spend $688 billion of their own money on Medicaid. Total state Medicaid spending over this period is projected to be $1,730 billion, of which $1,042 billion will be supplied by the federal government (if CBO's forecasts of federal spending prove correct). The difference between federal and state spending on Medicaid means that states will have to devote an average of 8 percent of their non-federal revenues to the program. Among the hardest hit states, Pennsylvania will have to devote 19 percent of its revenues to the health care program.
<p>
	As <a href="fyi63_1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows, the amount of state Medicaid payments alone steadily increases between 1995 and 2002. In 1990, the states spent just $32 billion of their non-federal funds on Medicaid. These unfunded payments are projected by our analysis to grow to $69 billion by 1995 and $104 billion by 2002. In other words, the Medicaid amount paid by the states will have increased by 225 percent over the twelve-year period between 1990 and 2002.
<p>
	Some individual states will be particularly hard hit. For example, California will need to raise $21.5 billion in new revenues or in budget cuts to pay its part of Medicaid growth between 1996 and 2002. Similarly, New York will need to raise $20 billion; Florida, $15.2 billion; Pennsylvania, $13.7 billion; and Texas $8.6 billion. If these states choose to raise taxes to meet their Medicaid obligations, then California will have to increase the average taxpayer's bill by $294 per year; New York, by $427; Florida, by $441; Pennsylvania, by $427; and Texas by $211.
<p>
	This rapid growth in the state's Medicaid share is reflected in the annual percentage change in state-level Medicaid spending as compared with total state spending, which includes support of such things as education, crime control, and transportation infrastructure (see <a href="fyi63_2.gif">Chart 2</a>). The Heritage analysis anticipates 1995 state Medicaid spending that is growing at a rate of 11 percent, while total state spending should grow at an 8 percent rate. This higher rate of change for Medicaid means that states either must raise taxes or must take funds away from other state programs. The forecast suggests that state spending on Medicaid will continue to keep pace with total spending. Over the forecast period (1995-2002), Medicaid spending is projected to grow at an 8 percent rate.
<P>
	Again, some states will be hit particularly hard. <a href="fyi63_3.gif">Chart 3</a> shows those states that are forecasted to have increases in Medicaid spending from their own revenues that are greater than 50 percent.
<p>

Technical Assumptions
<p>
	The Heritage Foundation and Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates used state models of economic activity to develop state-by-state estimates of Medicaid spending and the additional funds states would need to raise to meet their future Medicaid obligations.
<P>
	We assumed no change in the current Medicaid eligibility rules and allowed federal Medicaid transfers to the states to grow at the rates implied by the history of this program. Total Medicaid program spending in each state is a function of that state's historical Medicaid expenditures and expected demographic and economic change. We used this as the basic structure of future Medicaid spending.
<P>
	These baseline forecasts of state Medicaid spending were adjusted upwards by Heritage to reflect the higher federal Medicaid program spending projected by the Congressional Budget Office. The difference between our initial baseline for total (federal and state) spending and the CBO adjusted estimates is $98 billion over the period 1996 to 2002. We distributed the state portion of this additional amount by each state's annual percentage of total national Medicaid spending for each of the seven forecast years following 1995. Estimates of additional taxes that would be raised to meet each state's additional funding requirement were calculated by dividing the additional funding requirement by the estimated number of taxable individual federal income tax returns in 1995.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Terrorism is a cancer that has plagued the Middle East for
decades. It is now metastasizing into new and more deadly forms that
pose grave challenges to the United States and the West. Middle
Eastern terrorists are striking outside their home region, boldly
attacking high-profile targets, and killing in a more indiscriminate
manner. Last year the U.S., which had never suffered a major terrorist
attack on its soil by Middle Eastern terrorists, was rocked by the
bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City, which killed six
Americans and wounded over 1,000. This was the highest casualty toll
ever recorded for a single terrorist incident. A subsequent bombing
campaign against targets in New York City was stopped in its tracks in
June 1993 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
<P>
     The World Trade Center bombing embodies several ominous trends in
Middle Eastern terrorism. It epitomizes the drift toward large-scale,
indiscriminate violence. It also underscores the degree to which
radical Islamic extremists have supplanted radical nationalists, such
as the Palestine Liberation Organization, as the chief Middle Eastern
terrorist threat to the U.S. Moreover, radical Islamic groups are
inciting Sunni (orthodox) Muslims to support revolutionary terrorism
in Egypt and Algeria, just as radical Shia Muslims were incited by the
Iranian revolution. Finally, the Sudanese connection of several of the
bombers demonstrates how Sudan has become the "new Lebanon" -- a host
for a wide variety of terrorist groups and an important bridge between
Shia Iranian radicals and the new wave of Sunni Arab radicals.
<P>
     The United States cannot afford to ignore the wake-up calls
presented by the World Trade Center bombing and the foiled Iraqi-
sponsored assassination attempt against former President George Bush
during his April 1993 visit to Kuwait. The taboo against international
terrorist attacks inside the country and against important national
symbols has been broken. Washington must lead a concerted
international effort to make such terrorist attacks more difficult,
more costly to the perpetrators, and more risky for the states that
back them.

<P>
     The Worldwide Spread of Middle Eastern terrorism. The U.S. is by
no means the only country to feel the wrath of Middle Eastern
terrorists in recent months. In July, 117 people were killed in a
series of four bombings in nine days that swept Argentina, Panama, and
Britain. Most, if not all, of this carnage is believed to be the
handiwork of the world's most deadly terrorist organization --
Hezbollah (Party of God), an Iranian-sponsored and Syrian-backed
terrorist group based in Lebanon that perpetrated the October 1983
bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. In August, radical
Islamic terrorists seeking to overthrow the Algerian government killed
two Chinese and five French citizens in Algeria, as part of a
terrorist campaign against foreigners that has claimed 60 lives since
September 1993.
<P>
     Yet, the U.S. and its citizens have been the world's foremost
targets of international terrorism in recent years. The FBI estimates
that 32 percent of terrorist attacks worldwide from 1982 to 1992 were
targeted against Americans or American property. (FBI Terrorist
Research and Analytical Center, "Terrorism in the United States:
1982-1992" (Washington D.C., 1993), p. 11.) Middle Eastern terrorism
remains the greatest terrorist threat to the United States. Although
some 20 percent of all international terrorist incidents from 1982 to
1992 have been traced to Middle Eastern quarrels, these incidents have
accounted for about 35 percent of terrorist-related fatalities.
(Testimony of terrorism expert Brian Jenkins before the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, Subcommittee on International Security,
International Organizations and Human Rights, March 12,1993.) Middle
Eastern terrorist incidents repeatedly have drawn the U.S. into
international crises. State-sponsored terrorist attacks against
Americans have triggered U.S. military retaliation against Iran, Iraq,
and Libya. 
<P>
     Iran has been the foremost state sponsor of terrorism since the
1979 Iranian revolution. But terrorist attacks against Western targets
dropped off after the 1989 election of President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, who was more interested in rebuilding Iran with Western
help than in exporting revolution. Now that Rafsanjani is steadily
losing ground to more radical leaders in a bitter internal power
struggle, there could be an escalation of Iranian-sponsored terrorism.
Indeed, this may already have started to happen with Hezbollah's July
bombing campaign.
<P>
     Despite the growing danger, the Clinton Administration has failed
to mount a credible effort to stem the tide of terrorism. Although it
pays lip service to counterterrorism, the Administration unwisely
remains wedded to a State Department reorganization plan that would
downgrade the Office of Counterterrorism and signal friends and foes
that fighting terrorism is not a high priority. To more fully protect
American citizens from the scourge of Middle Eastern terrorism, the
Clinton Administration should:
<P>
Make counterterrorism a top priority in American foreign policy. 
  <P>   The Administration should shelve its plan to downgrade the status
of the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism and make
terrorism a top permanent agenda item at the annual G-7 summits.
<P>
Tackle international terrorism as a form of low-intensity warfare.
<P>     Treating it as a purely criminal matter does not effectively
address the issue of state-supported terrorism.
<P>
Punish state sponsors of terrorism on as many fronts as possible.
 <P>   Raise the diplomatic, economic, political, and military costs of
state terrorism to the point where they exceed the expected benefits.
<P>
Mobilize reluctant allies to maximize pressure on terrorist states and
groups. 
 <P>    Washington increasingly should apply public pressure on allied
governments, particularly in Europe, that appease terrorist states.
<P>
Maintain the option to retaliate unilaterally for terrorist attacks
with decisive military force. 
 <P>    The use or threat of force is an essential deterrent to state-
supported terrorism.
<P>
Stand firmly behind states threatened by Middle Eastern terrorism.
 <P>    Algeria, Egypt, Israel, and Turkey require firm U.S. support and
close cooperation against international terrorism.
<P>
Upgrade counterterrorism intelligence. 
 <P>    The FBI, CIA, and other intelligence agencies need to expand
their sources of human intelligence on international terrorism and
consult closely with allies and other concerned states.
<P>
Reform immigration laws to improve internal security.
<P>     Deportation proceedings should be streamlined, political asylum
requests should be screened more quickly and decisively and visas
should be denied to members of groups that use, support, or advocate
terrorism. Federal criminal penalties for visa and passport forgeries
should be toughened.
<P>
Work to restore order in anarchic areas where international terrorist
groups thrive. 
  <P>   The U.S. should back efforts by the governments of Lebanon and
Afghanistan to roll back the influence of Islamic radicals and
dismantle terrorist training camps.
<P>
THE UPSURGE IN RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM OUTSIDE THE MIDDLE EAST
<P>
     Middle Easterners are the prime suspects in a series of four
terrorist attacks against far-flung Western targets in July. On July
18 a car bomb destroyed a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires,
killing 96 people and wounding more than 200. The next day a bomb
destroyed a commuter plane in Panama, killing 21, most of them Jewish
businessmen. A car bomb exploded outside the Israeli Embassy in
Lebanon on July 27, wounding 13 people. The next day another car bomb
demolished the London offices of a Jewish charity organization.
<P>
     A previously unknown group calling itself Ansarallah (Partisans
of God) claimed responsibility for the Buenos Aires and Panama
bombings. American intelligence specialists believe that the group is
a subsidiary of Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based radical Shiite terrorist
organization. Sheik Sobhi Toufeili, the leader of Hezbollah's most
militant faction, is suspected of being the leader of the group.
(Louise Lief, "Partisans of Terror," U.S. News and World Report,
August 8, 1994, p. 36.) There has been speculation that the attacks
were meant to derail the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, because the
bombings straddled Jordanian King Hussein's July trip to Washington to
sign a non-belligerency accord with Israel. A more likely explanation,
however, is that this spate of terrorism was a spillover of the
intensifying fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in southern
Lebanon. 
<P>
     Hezbollah undoubtedly was smarting over Israel's capture of one
of its leaders, Mustafa Dirani, in Lebanon on May 21. The radical
Islamic terrorists also may have been angry over Israel's June 2 air
strike that killed some 45 of its cadres in Lebanon. Israeli and
American intelligence officials are said to have little doubt that
Iran also was behind the July 18 Buenos Aires bombing. (Testimony of
Steven Emerson, before the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
Subcommittee on International Security, International Organizations
and Human Rights, August 1, 1994.) Up to 20 Iranian Revolutionary
Guards, who train and equip Hezbollah forces, apparently were killed
in the June 2 air strike. (Michael Parks, "Bombings Underscore World's
Vulnerability," The Los Angeles Times, August 1, 1994, p. A3.) Iran
was implicated in a similar terrorist operation in Argentina that took
the lives of 29 people in March 1992. Hezbollah claimed responsibility
for that bombing, which destroyed the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires,
possibly retaliating for an earlier Israeli attack that killed its
military chief. Electronic intelligence intercepts and an extensive
forensic investigation revealed that Iranian officials had helped
acquire the plastic explosives used in that 1992 bombing. (Steven
Emerson, "Diplomacy That Can Stop Terrorism," The Wall Street Journal,
July 22, 1994, p. A10.) Iran also has been implicated in the July 18
Buenos Aires bombing by an Iranian defector questioned by Argentine
criminal investigators. (Gabriel Escobar, "Iranian Diplomats Said to
Be Suspects in Blast at Argentine Jewish Center," The Washington Post,
July 29, 1994, p. A27.) 
<P>
     The string of bombings in July greatly concerns U.S.
counterterrorism officials. They are worried about the ability of
Hezbollah terrorists to mount a sustained, coordinated, and well-
organized terrorist campaign against targets all over the globe. (The
car bomb used against the Israeli Embassy in London was delivered by a
woman, a fact that has led some experts to doubt involvement of
Hezbollah in that particular attack, because the organization
previously has condemned the use of women in terrorist actions.
Nevertheless, the possibility that a secular terrorist group carried
out that attack does not necessarily let Iran off the hook, because
Tehran has used secular groups such as the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine - General Command.) The attacks apparently
were planned well in advance and utilized local support networks for
reconnaissance and preparation. (Michael Parks, "Bombings Underscore
World's Vulnerability," The Los Angeles Times, August 1, 1994, p. A3.)
The July 19 mid-air bombing of a Panamanian commuter plane is
especially troubling because it may be the first suicide terrorist
attack on an airliner. (British counterterrorism officials secretly
have warned British airlines to be on guard for suicide bombers. Jamie
Dettner, "Airlines Warned of Suicide Bombers," The Washington Times,
August 8, 1994, p. A15.) 
  <P>   

 THE CONTINUING MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING
<P>
     The February 26, 1993, bombing of the World Trade Center was a
curious terrorist operation. On the one hand it was well-planned and
professional; the terrorists were able secretly to construct and
deploy a massive truck bomb. On the other hand, it was a surprisingly
amateurish operation. The four terrorists convicted of the attack took
unnecessary risks, such as giving a correct name and address when
renting a vehicle for delivering the bomb.
<P>
     So far, no foreign state has been found responsible for the World
Trade Center attack. But there are disturbing shreds of circumstantial
evidence that point to possible Iranian or Iraqi involvement. Sheik
Omar Abdul Rahman, the radical Egyptian cleric who inspired and
possibly directed the bombers, long has been on the Iranian payroll,
according to Vincent Cannistraro, the former head of CIA
counterterrorism operations. (Bill Gertz, "Iran Backs Terrorist
Networks in U.S., Canada," The Washington Times, March 17, 1993, p.
A7.) Sheik Omar regularly was given large sums of money by Iran's
intelligence service, using Iran's delegation to the United Nations as
a conduit. ("Washington Whispers," U.S. News and World Report, May 31,
1993, p. 23.) U.S. government investigators discovered that about
$100,000 was transferred to the suspects before the bombing from banks
in foreign countries, including Iran, but it is not known if this was
payment for the attack or for other activities such as propaganda or
recruitment. (Ralph Blumenthal, "$100,000 Is Linked to Trade Center
Suspects," The New York Times, April 25, 1993, p. 41.)
<P>
     Other signs point toward Iraq. For instance, the attack took
place during the second anniversary of the ground offensive against
Iraq in Operation Desert Storm. Terrorist attacks launched on
anniversaries historically have been a common means of seeking
vengeance in the Middle East. Another troubling circumstance is that
Ramzi Yousef, who apparently set the plot in motion, entered the U.S.
in 1992 on an Iraqi passport on a trip that began in Iraq. Moreover,
Abdul Yasin, an Iraqi suspect who cooperated with the FBI and was
released from jail, later flew back to Iraq and is now believed to be
living in Baghdad. Many New York law enforcement officials reportedly
believe that Iraq was involved, although they can not prove it.
(Laurie Mylroie, "World Trade Center Bombing -- The Case of Secret
Cyanide," The Wall Street Journal, July 26, 1994, p. A16.)
<P>
     Iraq also would seem to have more to gain from such a terrorist
operation than Iran. Saddam would have had a strong incentive to
punish the U.S. for its role in Desert Storm. Iraq also may have
wanted to provoke a confrontation between the U.S. and its arch-rival
Iran by casting suspicion on Tehran for the bombing. This would
strengthen Iraq's perceived value in the Middle East as a bulwark
against revolutionary Iran, an argument Iraqi diplomats have made in
attempts to persuade members of the United Nations Security Council to
lift the U.N.-mandated sanctions against Iraq. (Iraq also had
sponsored a similarly deceptive terrorist operation in June 1982, when
it ordered the Abu Nidal Organization, a renegade Palestinian
terrorist group, to shoot the Israeli Ambassador to Britain, an act
which provoked Israel to punish the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) by invading Lebanon to destroy its base camps. The payoff for
Iraq was that the Israelis dealt Iraq's rival Syria a sharp military
setback in the course of the Lebanon War, and precluded Syria from
joining its ally Iran in its 1980-1988 war with Iraq.)
<P>
     A final disquieting consideration was the nature of the World
Trade Center bomb itself. Not only was the bomb huge, loaded with
1,200 pounds of explosives, but it was customized with compressed
hydrogen to magnify the blast and sodium cyanide to create a poisonous
cloud after the explosion. (The sodium cyanide apparently burned up
completely instead of turning into a gas. See Mylroie, op. cit., p.
A16.) A bomb that big and sophisticated has never before been
detonated by a terrorist group that did not have state sponsorship or
long-standing experience in building explosive devices.
<P>
THE NEW BREED OF RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS
<P>
     The World Trade Center bombers are a new breed of terrorist.
Unlike the tightly disciplined cells that dominated terrorism in the
past, they functioned in a loosely organized ad hoc manner. Three of
the six charged with the bombing were dedicated followers of Sheik
Omar Abdul Rahman, the fiery spiritual leader of the Islamic Group, a
radical fundamentalist movement that has waged a terrorist campaign to
overthrow the Egyptian government.
<P>
     At least three of the six bombers had fought in the war in
Afghanistan against Soviet and Afghan communists. The Sheik also made
at least three visits there since 1980 and two of his sons reportedly
fought there. Thousands of Muslims from roughly 40 countries flocked
to Afghanistan following the 1979 Soviet invasion. (Pakistani
officials estimated that at least 2800 foreign Muslims remained in
Afghanistan in 1993. Edward Gargan, "Where Arab Militants Train and
Wait," The New York Times, August 11, 1993, p. A8.) Radicalized
veterans from the Afghan war -- called by some journalists the
"University of Jihad"(Holy War) -- have returned home and have become
the spearheads of radical Islamic movements in Algeria, Azerbaijan,
Bosnia, Egypt, Sudan, and many other places around the world. (Tim
Weiner, "Blowback From the Afghan Battlefield," The New York Times
Magazine, March 13, 1994, p. 53.) Hundreds of these "Afghanis" are
being trained by Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Sudanese training
camps.
<P>
     Radical Islamic movements have mushroomed not only in the Muslim
world, but also among Muslim immigrants in the West. The World Trade
Center bombers were all either recent immigrants or illegal aliens.
Although they may have been drawn to America by economic opportunities
and political freedoms, these terrorists rejected America's values and
what they considered to be its degenerate culture of materialism and
secularism. Rejecting assimilation into the resented society of their
host country, they were susceptible to incitement by Sheik Omar. What
they did mirrors what happened in several other terrorism cases, such
as Hezbollah's 1985-1986 bombing campaign in France and its bombings
in Buenos Aires in 1992 and 1994. In all three cases, small portions
of local immigrant communities provided support for the terrorist
operations. 
<P>
     Ironically, many radical Islamic movements outlawed in their own
countries have found sanctuary in Western countries. So long as they
are in the West, they cannot be arrested by the police back home. Like
Sheik Omar, leaders of these radical movements lambaste their host
countries while taking advantage of their open political systems to
travel freely, organize politically, raise funds, recruit new members,
support underground opposition movements in their home countries, and
sometimes to direct terrorist activities. Germany long has been a base
for Islamic extremists. (German intelligence officials estimate that
about 700 Arab extremists live there, along with over 42,000 other
foreign extremists. Jim McGee, "U.S. Pledges Global Pursuit in
Bombing," The Washington Post, March 13, 1993.) The U.S. has become a
safe haven for Hezbollah, the Islamic Group, Algerian fundamentalists,
and Palestinian fundamentalists. Israeli officials claim that Hamas
(Islamic Resistance Movement), the radical Palestinian Islamic group
that is using terrorism to undermine the nascent Palestinian-Israeli
peace, actually is directed from a headquarters in the United States.
(Ehud Yaari, "A Safe Haven for Hamas in America," The New York Times,
January 27, 1993.) 
<P>
     The support networks that these terrorist groups are forming
inside the U.S. for fundraising, recruitment, and propaganda
activities could become the nucleus for terrorist attacks on American
soil. These potential terrorists are dangerous because, unlike hit
teams dispatched from the Middle East, they are now blending into
Western societies where they have established personal and communal
roots. U.S. counterterrorism officials worry that "sleeper cells"
already established inside the U.S. could lie dormant for many years
until activated for specific terrorist actions. (The FBI discovered a
sleeper cell of the Abu Nidal organization inside the U.S. in 1986 and
arrested four Palestinian members in April 1993 after one member of
the group murdered his daughter. See William Carley, "A Trail of
Terror," The Wall Street Journal, June 16, 1993, p. A1.)
<P>
     Moreover, the decentralized structure of many of the radical
Islamic movements makes it difficult for host governments to detect,
defend against, or apprehend terrorists lurking within these
movements. The loosely linked informal webs of Islamic militants,
often organized in small groups around a charismatic cleric, are
harder to track and infiltrate than the more rigidly organized
Palestinian terrorist groups that have been a major threat for
decades. The Palestinian groups had a more straightforward
organization and often were corrupt and therefore susceptible to
bribery. They also were easier to penetrate because infighting between
rival organizations led them to provide information on each other.
<P>
     The new breed of radical Islamic terrorist is more intractable,
less likely to betray other terrorists, and more unpredictable. In
contrast to long-established Palestinian terrorist groups who had more
predictable targets and objectives, Islamic radicals have more unclear
motives and a wider variety of targets. They not only attack Israel,
secular governments in Muslim countries, and states that support the
secular regimes they oppose, they also target reporters with whom they
disagree, intellectuals they despise (such as Salman Rushdie, the
author of The Satanic Verses), and Western cultural institutions such
as the American University in Beirut. 
<P>
     Most Palestinian terrorist groups refrained from assaulting
Americans or launching attacks on American soil. The reason: they
wanted to influence American public opinion to change U.S. foreign
policy and to drive a wedge between Israel and America. They made the
cold-blooded political calculation that killing Americans would hurt,
rather than help their political cause. 
<P>
     This self-imposed restraint often is not as strong among Islamic
militants. This new breed of terrorist is hostile not only to American
policies, but to many American values. For example, they reject
secular law and democracy and the separation of church and state. They
view American culture as a threat to Islamic piety and revile what
they perceive to be the degenerate secular and materialist bias of
American society. To Islamic radicals, the U.S. is the villainous
successor of the European colonial empires that have sought to
dominate the Middle East since the time of the crusades. In their holy
war against the West, terrorism is an acceptable instrument for
carrying out the will of God. Because they are motivated by
apocalyptic zeal, and not sober political calculations, their choice
of possible targets is much wider and more indiscriminate than that of
other terrorists. Since they are less predictable, they can be more
dangerous than Palestinian or other Middle Eastern terrorists.
<P>
     Islamic radicals also often have a different audience in mind
than Palestinian nationalists. Instead of using terrorism to influence
Western powers to change their policies, they often use terrorism to
punish Western powers and inspire other Muslims to rise up against the
West. This focus on the Muslim audience rather than an American
audience helps explain how the bombers of the World Trade Center could
rationalize their bloody actions. The bombing was meant to demonstrate
the power of Islamic radicals and the vulnerability of the U.S., not
to lead the U.S. to rethink its Middle East policy.
<P>
THE PERSISTENT THREAT OF STATE-SPONSORED TERRORISM
<P>
     The Middle East is a hotbed of state-sponsored terrorism. Five of
the seven states that have been branded by the U.S. government as
sponsors of international terrorism-- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, and
Syria--are located in the region. (Cuba and North Korea are the other
two on the State Department's list of states that sponsor terrorism.)
Moreover, 22 of the 41 major international terrorist groups described
in the State Department's annual report on global terrorism are based
in the Middle East. (See U.S. Department of State, Patterns of Global
Terrorism: 1993, April 1994, Appendix B.) The region not only is
infested with more terrorist groups than any other region, but these
groups subscribe to a wider variety of ideologies and causes, ranging
from Marxism to secular Arab, Armenian, Kurdish, and Palestinian
nationalism to radical Islamic fundamentalism. Each year the Middle
East is the world's foremost exporter of terrorism, with most of the
spillover afflicting Western Europe. (Between 1980 and 1989 over 400
terrorist actions spilled over from the Middle East to other regions,
with 87 percent of these actions occurring in Western Europe. Paul
Wilkinson, "Terrorism, Iran and the Gulf Region," Jane's Intelligence
Review, May 1992, p. 222.)
<P>
     Because of the heavy concentration of terrorist states and
terrorist groups, most new trends in terrorism develop in the Middle
East, then spread quickly to other regions. Radical Palestinian groups
such as the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
(PFLP) pioneered the tactic of airline hijackings after the 1967 Arab-
Israeli war. When improved airport security measures made hijacking
more difficult, Palestinian groups such as the 15 May organization
were in the forefront of the trend of airline bombings. 
<P>
     Most terrorist groups prior to 1970 were autonomous organizations
of indigenous dissidents that pursued their own agendas without
outside support. (Neil Livingston and Terrell Arnold, eds., Fighting
Back: Winning the War Against Terrorism (Lexington, Mass: D.C. Heath,
1986) p. 12.) During the 1970s the Soviet Union and its satellites
greatly expanded their support for terrorist groups. Moscow often used
Middle Eastern client states such as Iraq, Libya, Syria, and the
former People's Democratic Republic of South Yemen as intermediaries
to mask Soviet arms, training, intelligence, and logistical support
for a wide variety of terrorist groups. 
<P>
     The radical Arab states, which regularly used terrorism as a tool
of repression against internal opposition, sought their own terrorist
surrogates to wield as weapons against Israel, Western powers, and
other Middle Eastern states. Libya, Syria, and Iraq courted
Palestinian splinter groups or created their own Palestinian puppet
organizations to buttress their claims to Arab leadership. These
puppets also were used as proxy terrorists who, if caught, would not
bring down retaliation on the head of the state sponsor.
<P>
     The 1979 Iranian revolution brought Iran into the forefront of
international terrorism. Iran organized, trained, equipped, and
financed Shiite revolutionary movements such as Hezbollah in Lebanon
and Ad Dawa (The Call) in Iraq and the Gulf States. Under Iranian
supervision, Hezbollah unleashed a lethal terrorist campaign in 1983
to drive the Western peacekeeping forces out of Lebanon, bombing the
U.S. Embassy in Beirut in April and the Marine barracks in October.
After Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was elected President in 1989,
Iranian support for international terrorism was toned down and the
Western hostages held by Hezbollah in Lebanon gradually were released
by the end of 1991. But assassinations of Iranian exile leaders
continued at an alarming pace. Government-sponsored terrorism also was
supplemented by terrorism financed by Iranian so-called charitable
foundations, many of which are controlled by radical clerics opposed
to many of Rafsanjani's policies. One of these, the Fifteenth of
Khordad Foundation, has put a $2 million bounty on the head of Salman
Rushdie, condemned to death as a blasphemer by Ayatollah Khomeini in
1989. (Rushdie's publishers, translators, and bookstores that sell his
books have been targeted for terrorist attacks. In the last five years
113 people have died in violence related to the Rushdie affair in more
than 20 countries. See Bizhan Torabi, "The West, Iran Deadlocked Over
Rushdie," The Washington Times, February 16, 1994, p. A13.) 
<P>
     President Rafsanjani's power steadily has been eroded by radical
rivals who have gained dominance over the Iranian parliament. He is a
lame duck, prohibited by the Iranian constitution from running for re-
election for a third term in 1996. As the struggle to succeed him
intensifies, there is a good chance that Iran's support for terrorism
will escalate. The West and the U.S. make convenient targets for hard-
liners in their fight to seize power. In fact, Iran already has become
more aggressive in supporting terrorism. In addition to suspected
Iranian involvement in the July bombings in Buenos Aires and London,
three Iranians await trial in Thailand for an attempt to bomb the
Israeli Embassy in Bangkok in March. In April, the British government
charged that it had clear evidence of growing contacts between Irish
Republican Army terrorists and Iranian embassies in Europe. (In
addition to providing money and possibly arms to the I.R.A., London
charged that Iran also was building links to the Syria-based Japanese
Red Army. Stewart Dalby, "Iran Accused of Terrorist Links," Financial
Times, April 29, 1994, p. 1.) In May, more than 300 Iranian
Revolutionary Guards arrived in Bosnia to organize Muslim militias and
terrorist groups, according to U.S. intelligence sources. (Bill Gertz,
"Iranians Move into Bosnia to Terrorize Serbs," The Washington Times,
June 2, 1994, p. A1.)
<P>
TOWARD A MORE EFFECTIVE U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY
<P>
     The U.S. has an historic opportunity to crack down on Middle East
terrorism. The end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet Empire
have deprived Middle Eastern terrorist states of superpower backing.
The embryonic peace agreement between Israel and the PLO has reduced
one source of terrorism, although Palestinian rejectionists both
within and outside the PLO continue their terrorist war against
Israel. Iraq's defeat in the Gulf War and subsequent isolation has
constrained state support from that quarter, particularly as long as
Baghdad moderates its policies in an effort to wriggle out of U.N.-
sponsored economic sanctions. Iran and Libya are isolated and beset by
substantial economic problems caused in part by low oil prices.
Sudan's radical Islamic regime is drained by a long-running civil war
and a grim economic situation. Syria faces a precarious future as
President Hafez al-Assad, not in the best of health, plots his
personal political endgame. 
<P>
     All of these Middle Eastern regimes, which have exported so much
terrorism-related misery, are simultaneously vulnerable on a number of
different fronts. In the past they have been able to shrug off Western
demands to halt their support of terrorism. But now that they have
lost Soviet backing and have become increasingly dependent on the West
for economic support, that is no longer true. The West now has more
influence and leverage over these states. Moreover, many of these
regimes are threatened by internal political opposition, or the
prospect of such opposition in the near future. The U.S. and other
Western powers, therefore, gain potential leverage by supporting or
threatening to support opposition groups hostile to terrorist regimes.
<P>
     While the threat or actual use of force is the ultimate deterrent
to terrorism, experienced terrorist states and groups often are
successful in concealing their responsibility for terrorist outrages
to avoid military reprisals. To deter terrorism, Washington must
convince its allies and other concerned states to increase the
diplomatic, economic, military,and political costs of state-supported
terrorism. A unified Western campaign to curtail Middle Eastern
terrorism now has a greater chance for success than ever before. Only
the U.S. can forge and lead such a coalition. To build an
international consensus to combat terrorism and to follow through and
act on that consensus, the Clinton Administration should:
<P>
Make counterterrorism a top priority in American foreign policy. 
<P>
     The Clinton Administration must drop its short-sighted plan for
downgrading the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism. This
reorganization plan would fold that office into a new Bureau for
Narcotics, Terrorism and Crime and demote the Coordinator for
Counterterrorism from the current equivalent of an Assistant Secretary
of State to the level of a Deputy Assistant Secretary. L. Paul Bremer,
a former Ambassador-at-Large for Counterterrorism, noting that the
office would be "gutted," charged that: "The Clinton Administration
has neglected the terrorist threat, with our public officials paying
only lip service to the problem." (L. Paul Bremer, "With Assad, Talk
About Terrorism," The Wall Street Journal, January 14, 1994, p. A10.)
   <P>
	Congress has temporarily blocked the Administration's plans.
Under the leadership of Representative Benjamin Gilman (R-NY), the
House voted on April 18, 1994, to retain an independent Office of
Counterterrorism. But the Administration has not given up on its
reorganization plan, which originated in the Bush Administration as a
cost-cutting measure. 
<P>
     Congress will again have to wrestle with the reorganization plan
after April 30, 1995, when the Gilman amendment expires. At that time,
Congress should consider insisting that the Administration permanently
shelve its plans to downgrade State's counterterrorism office. This
office instead must be given the bureaucratic clout to champion tough
anti-terrorism policies against other bureaus in the State Department,
or in other departments, that have little or no interest in combating
terrorism. Therefore, the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, who is the
U.S. government's senior full-time counterterrorism official, must
have direct access to the Secretary of State, and not be relegated, as
the Administration plans, to the bottom of a cumbersome reporting
chain. To secure the diplomatic clout that is needed to impress U.S.
allies and terrorist nations, the Coordinator should be restored to
the status of ambassador-at-large, as was the case during the Reagan
Administration. 
<P>
     Washington should aggressively raise the profile of the
counterterrorism issue by injecting it into every multilateral
diplomatic forum and every high-level bilateral meeting with officials
from allied governments or terrorist regimes. The U.S. should ensure
that the issue of terrorism appears automatically on the agenda at
every G-7 summit. The Coordinator for Counterterrorism should become a
permanent fixture at the summits as the prime mover in a multilateral
working group on counterterrorism.
<P>
Tackle international terrorism as a form of low-intensity warfare. 
<P>
     Terrorism is the most ubiquitous kind of low-intensity conflict.
Yet, it is too often treated primarily as a law enforcement issue.
While bringing the rule of law to bear on terrorists is desirable, it
is not always possible, particularly when terrorists are being
protected by a state sponsor. In cases of state-supported terrorism,
which the CIA estimates comprise up to 80 percent of all international
terrorism, it is not realistic to rely solely on law enforcement
agencies to fight terrorists. 
<P>
     State-supported terrorism is in effect an act of war and should
be approached as a form of surrogate warfare. The U.S. should not
unnecessarily hobble itself in this war against terrorism by treating
state-sponsored foreign terrorists the same as it treats domestic
terrorist groups. Counterterrorist forces should not require courtroom
standards of evidence before they take action. Adopting a narrow
legalistic approach to fighting terrorism would lead to American
paralysis and terrorism would proliferate unchecked. 
<P>
     The U.S. should make use of the full arsenal of its weapons
against terrorism by relaxing self-imposed restrictions on special
operations. For example, Executive Order No. 11905, signed in 1976,
was designed to prohibit assassinations of foreign leaders, but it
also has been interpreted as prohibiting commando assaults on
terrorist groups. This executive order should be refined to permit
such special operations, particularly against terrorist groups that
have killed Americans in the past, such as Hezbollah or the Abu Nidal
organization. Counterterrorist teams also should be deployed to
apprehend terrorists in anarchic areas such as Lebanon or Afghanistan,
and not just in international waters or airspace.
<P>
     The U.S. should also make greater use of non-violent covert
actions, such as the dissemination of disinformation to create
dissension inside terrorist groups and psychological warfare to
aggravate the terrorists' sense of vulnerability and to encourage
distrust of their state sponsors. Agents of influence, wherever they
can be inserted, would help to disrupt terrorist operations and turn
terrorists against each other. Sabotage operations also should be
launched against the safehouses, logistics support networks, and
financial assets of terrorist groups. 
<P>
Punish state sponsors of terrorism on as many fronts as possible. 
<P>
     Middle Eastern states have relied heavily on state-sponsored
terrorism because it is a cost-effective tool to their foreign
policies. The U.S. should work with its allies and other concerned
states to raise the diplomatic, economic, political, and military
costs of supporting terrorism so high that it outweighs the strategic
benefits.
<P>
Diplomatic sanctions. 
<P>
     Countries victimized by terrorism in the past have broken
relations or reduced the size of the diplomatic mission of the state
sponsor. This helps limit the threat of terrorism, because much of it
is directed, supported, and financed by intelligence personnel
operating under diplomatic cover. But diplomatic sanctions usually
have been unilateral, ad hoc responses that have had little effect on
terrorist states. Washington should propose an agreement among the G-7
and NATO allies that would require all of them to expel large numbers
of diplomats, if not break diplomatic relations completely, with
states that support terrorist attacks. Moreover, diplomatic personnel
of these states should be expelled for each confirmed terrorist attack
by a surrogate terrorist group. 
<P>
     This measure would raise the public uproar over terrorism and
increase the costs of each attack. This may give pause to some
terrorist states, particularly those such as Iran and Sudan, that want
the West to bail them out of dire economic predicaments. At a minimum,
reducing the diplomatic presence of terrorist states will make it
harder for them to support terrorism out of their embassies. For
example, the expulsion of diplomats greatly undermined Iraq's ability
to export terrorism during the 1991 Gulf War. 
<P>
     Regardless of whether it can gain G-7 support for such an
agreement, the U.S. should pressure its allies to pare down the
diplomatic presence of Iranian and Sudanese diplomats in their
countries. Diplomats from Iran and Sudan have been implicated in the
July bombing in Buenos Aires and in the 1993 bomb plots in New York
City. The Iranian diplomatic presence particularly should be cut back
in Germany and Venezuela, which are centers for Iran's intelligence
and terrorist networks.
<P>
     Economic sanctions. Washington should persuade its allies to
participate in developing a multilateral version of the State
Department's list of states that support terrorism. Once placed on the
list, a terrorist state should be denied economic assistance, arms
sales, and preferential trade privileges from all participating
states. Further, the allies would be committed to voting against
financial aid for that state in international financial institutions
such as the World Bank. If Western Europe and Japan presented a united
front in threatening to impose sanctions, it could have a sobering
effect on the five Middle Eastern terrorist states. All, with the
possible exception of Libya, will require Western or Japanese economic
assistance, loans or renegotiation of existing loans in the near
future. Iran already is staggering under the financial burden of its
$30 billion foreign debt. Iraq owes foreign creditors more than $14
billion, Syria owes $16.5 billion, and Sudan's foreign debt is in
excess of $16 billion. Now that the Soviet Union has dissolved, they
have no place else to go. The U.S. should convince its allies to take
advantage of their financial leverage and elevate counterterrorism to
the forefront of economic aid and loan renegotiation decisions. 
<P>
     Trade sanctions against terrorist states will be more difficult
to extract from the Western Europeans and Japanese since they see
Iran, Iraq, and Libya as potentially lucrative export markets and
important sources of oil supplies. France and other countries already
are impatient to lift the U.N.-sponsored economic sanctions on Iraq.
To block this, Washington should make Iraq a high-priority test case
for Western anti-terrorism cooperation. The U.S. should stress Iraq's
abortive plot to assassinate former President George Bush during his
visit to Kuwait in April 1993 (For more on Iraq's assassination plot,
see James A. Phillips, "Punish Saddam's Terrorism With Military
Action," Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum No. 358, June 11,
1993.) and Baghdad's continuing terrorist attacks on the Kurds and on
U.N. personnel in northern Iraq. To test Baghdad's intentions,
Washington should request the extradition of Abdul Yasin, an Iraqi who
participated in the plot to bomb the World Trade Center, who returned
to Iraq. (Yasin was seen outside his father's house in Baghdad by an
ABC News reporter earlier this year. Mylroie, op. cit.) If Baghdad
balks at observing the terms of the extradition treaty that it signed
with the U.S., then it clearly will be in violation of U.N. Security
Council Resolution Number 687 (April 1991), which called on Iraq to
abandon its support of terrorism. This violation could become a
justification for maintaining the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
<P>
     The Europeans have been more cooperative in imposing economic
sanctions on Libya for its refusal to extradite two suspects in the
1988 Pan Am flight 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. But these
U.N.-imposed sanctions have fallen short of an embargo on Libyan oil.
The U.S. should expand the sanctions to include Libya's oil exports.
Washington should work through the U.N. Security Council to impose an
oil export regime similar to the one imposed on Iraq: oil revenues
would be funneled into a U.N.-administered escrow account that could
be used to pay reparations to the families of victims of Libyan
terrorism. This could be a model to punish other terrorist states that
block international efforts to apprehend terrorists.
<P>
     Another terrorist state that is extremely vulnerable to concerted
international economic sanctions because of its crumbling economy is
Sudan. It already has sought to appease the West by turning over the
notorious Venezuelan-born terrorist Illich Ramirez Sanchez, alias
"Carlos the Jackal," to France on August 15. (Carlos was a terrorist
playboy who had outlived his usefulness to Syria, which had harbored
him until 1991. Carlos's leftist politics did not endear him to
Sudan's radical Islamic regime.) 
<P>
     Iran will be a more difficult case because of the reluctance of
America's allies, particularly Germany and Japan, to sacrifice their
short-term commercial interests in exporting to Iran. Now that Iran is
having difficulty repaying its debts, foreign creditors may be more
willing to consider trade sanctions against Tehran. In any case, the
U.S. could strengthen its case for economic sanctions against Iran if
President Clinton blocks the proposed $750 million sale of up to 20
Boeing 737 jetliners to Iran and prohibits U.S. oil companies, the
largest purchasers of Iranian oil, from buying Iran's oil exports.
(American oil companies currently are prohibited from importing
Iranian oil into the U.S. but are allowed to buy it for resale
elsewhere. See James Phillips, "Containing Iran," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 980, March 9, 1994.)
<P>
     The U.S. should drive up the prospective political costs of
state-sponsored terrorism. This can be done by supporting opposition
groups in countries that engage in international terrorism. All Middle
Eastern terrorist states have generated domestic opposition.
Washington should provide diplomatic, economic, and even military
support to the most viable opposition groups in terrorist states. The
Kurds in Iraq, the resistance movements in southern Sudan, pro-Western
exile groups and the increasingly restless Azeris, Baluch, and Kurds
in Iran, and Libyan dissidents all merit increased American and
Western support. The Assad regime in Syria has brutally eliminated
most domestic opposition, but President Assad's persistent health
problems and the recent death of his son and heir apparent, Basil, has
increased uncertainty about the political durability of Syria's
minority Alawite regime. Although there may be no viable opposition
inside Syria in the short run, the U.S. should increase its diplomatic
support for an independent Lebanon free from Syrian domination. 
<P>
Mobilize reluctant allies to maximize pressure on terrorist states and
groups.
<P>
     Western Europe has borne the brunt of the spillover of Middle
Eastern terrorism, yet historically has been reluctant to take
determined action against it. Too often, European states have sought
to appease terrorist states and cut separate deals with them, rather
than take a unified stand against terrorism. Last October, Germany
hosted a visit by Iran's Minister of Intelligence and Security, Ali
Fallahiyan, the overseer of much of Iran's terrorist operations.
France appeased Iran last December by expelling two suspected Iranian
terrorists whose extradition had been sought by Switzerland for the
1990 assassination of an Iranian opposition leader in Geneva. 
<P>
     The U.S. must drive home to its allies that appeasement of
terrorism is a self-defeating policy that only encourages more
terrorism. France may be ripe for persuasion, now that an upsurge in
terrorist attacks against French citizens in Algeria led Paris to
crack down on exiled Algerian radicals in France in early August.
France now criticizes the U.S. and Germany for allowing exiled
Algerian radicals to continue to operate freely within their borders.
Washington should cooperate with France and closely monitor the
activities of Algerian radicals in the U.S., while pressing Paris to
support greater international cooperation in isolating terrorist
states, particularly Iran.
<P>
     Germany and Japan, the two biggest exporters to Iran, are the
weak links in Western efforts to isolate Iran. Both states argue that
they aid Iranian "moderates" by maintaining good trade and diplomatic
relations with Iran. This rationale has grown increasingly threadbare
in view of Iran's continued support of terrorism. Besides, Iran's
"moderates" are losing ground to more radical elements in Tehran who
are likely to escalate terrorism unless confronted with firm
international pressures. The U.S. should strongly warn Germany and
Japan, first privately and increasingly in public, that appeasement
only encourages Iran and other terrorist states to believe that
terrorism is cost-free. Worse, by conducting preferential trade
relations with Iran and granting it foreign aid and loans, Germany and
Japan are subsidizing Iran's terrorism. 
<P>
     Washington also should press its allies to establish a high-level
central office for coordinating counterterrorism policies. These
offices could act as liaisons with allied counterterrorism agencies.
Modeled on the U.S. Office of Counterterrorism, these offices would
help raise the profile of counterterrorism as an international issue
and make international cooperation more effective and timely.
Washington also should lobby all its allies to adopt stiffer penalties
for terrorism, including longer jail terms and the seizure of the
assets of terrorist groups or states. The Europeans, in particular,
should be pressed to stop releasing terrorists before their sentences
have been completed.
<P>
     Washington also should press Saudi Arabia to halt the flow of
financial aid to radical Islamic movements. Substantial sums of money
from private Saudi religious foundations and individuals have
bankrolled Sheik Abdul Rahman and other radical fundamentalists.
Riyadh placed restrictions on the flow of these funds outside the
country in 1993 but needs to more carefully control the activities of
the Islamic foundations to prevent them from meddling in the internal
affairs of other Muslim countries. 
<P>
Maintain the option to retaliate unilaterally for terrorist attacks
with decisive military force. 
<P>
     The use or threat of use of military force is essential for
punishing and deterring state-sponsored terrorism. The military
response should be designed to raise the cost of terrorism above the
price a terrorist state is willing to pay. The U.S. should not get
bogged down in a tit-for-tat exchange by limiting its attacks merely
to terrorist training camps. Instead, it should strike targets that
the terrorist state highly values, such as its internal security
forces and secret police. For example, if Iran or one of its
surrogates, such as Hezbollah, lashes out at an American target, the
U.S. should not content itself with destroying a few easily
replaceable terrorist camps in Lebanon or Iran. Rather, the U.S.
should attack Iran's Revolutionary Guards which train terrorists and
provide internal security, as well as Iran's Ministry of Intelligence
and Security.
<P>
     A sharp and decisive military reprisal not only can have a
deterrent effect on the terrorist state attacked, it also can have a
strong demonstration effect on other states that support terrorism.
For example, the April 1986 air strikes against Libya had a
significant impact on Syria as well as Libya. According to the State
Department, Libya reduced its involvement in international terrorism
from 19 incidents in 1986 to six in 1987, while Syrian involvement
fell from 34 in 1985 to six in 1986 and to one in 1987.
<P>
     Special operations are an important option for fighting
terrorists close to innocent civilians, in hostage rescue operations,
and in efforts to apprehend terrorist leaders. The Pentagon must make
an effort to maintain the strength and readiness of the Special
Operations Command which includes the elite "Delta Force," Army
Special Operations Forces, Navy Seals, Marine Reconnaissance teams,
and a special assault unit from the 101st Air Assault Division. These
forces should be periodically dispatched on anti-terrorism training
exercises in friendly Middle Eastern states to give them familiarity
with the region and experience with desert warfare. 
<P>
Stand firmly behind states threatened by Middle Eastern terrorism. 
<P>
     Middle Eastern terrorists pose much more of a threat to secular
and moderate regimes in the Muslim world than to the West. Islamic
revolutionary movements have used terrorism to undermine and
demoralize ruling governments, polarize societies, and intimidate
secular opposition. Terrorists have become the shock troops of Islamic
revolutionary movements seeking the overthrow of the governments of
Egypt and Algeria. The U.S. has a major stake in both countries. A
radical Islamic revolution in either of them would send shock waves
throughout the Arab world.
<P>
     Washington should steadfastly support the governments of Egypt
and Algeria in their efforts to reach an accommodation with political
opposition groups while firmly suppressing terrorists. American
diplomats should not meet publicly with radical Islamic leaders
because this could undermine the existing government. Nor should
Washington permit radical Islamic leaders, such as Tunisian
revolutionary Rashid el-Ghanoushi, to visit America unless they reject
terrorism. Nor should it pressure any government to enter talks with
any group that supports terrorism. Whenever possible the U.S. should
share its intelligence on terrorist groups and their supporters with
the governments battling revolutionary terrorists.
<P>
     In addition to supporting moderate Arab regimes threatened by
terrorism, the U.S. should cooperate closely with Turkey and Israel in
combating terrorism. Both countries are valuable sources of
intelligence on international terrorism and should be furnished with
American intelligence on terrorist activities in a timely manner. The
U.S. also should maintain relentless pressure on Syria to halt its
support for the Kurdish Workers Party and the Armenian Secret Army for
the Liberation of Armenia, two terrorist groups that have killed
scores of Turks. Moreover, Washington should strongly back Israel's
demand that any Syrian-Israeli peace agreement must include guarantees
that Syria will cease its support for Palestinian terrorists and help
end Hezbollah's rein of terror in Lebanon. 
<P>
Upgrade counterterrorism intelligence. 
<P>
     Fighting terrorism effectively requires detailed and timely
intelligence about the operations of terrorist groups, their support
networks and their state sponsors. The FBI has made effective use of
intelligence information to pre-empt at least 78 terrorist plots since
1982. (Estimate provided by Kevin Giblin, Senior Intelligence Officer
for Counterterrorism, FBI, in an August 3, 1993 Forum of the U.S.
Global Strategy Council entitled "Terrorism: The Next Phase?") But the
new breed of radical Islamic terrorists, organized in informal
amorphous groups, presents a new challenge for intelligence-gathering.
To maintain and expand its intelligence network, the FBI should make a
systematic effort to recruit Arab-Americans and American Muslims.
<P>
     The CIA needs to upgrade the volume and quality of its human
intelligence on terrorist groups and states. It must develop a more
extensive network of agents dedicated to counterterrorism intelligence
and infiltrate terrorist groups on a long-term basis. The CIA should
make every effort to recruit American and foreign personnel with
extensive knowledge of and experience in the cultures and societies of
their terrorist adversaries. The CIA's Counterterrorist Center,
created in 1986 by President Reagan after the hijacking of TWA flight
847, should be expanded and devote more resources to surveillance of
the new breed of radical Islamic terrorists. The National Security
Agency and various defense intelligence agencies should be directed to
give counterterrorism a higher priority in their intelligence-
gathering efforts. The Defense Department also should consider
dedicating more of its reconnaissance satellites to gathering
information on possible military targets related to terrorism, such as
terrorist bases and training camps in terrorist states and the Syrian-
controlled areas of Lebanon.
<P>
     In addition, the U.S. should improve its efforts to reward
informants who provide useful information about terrorist activities.
The State Department's International Counterterrorism reward program
provides monetary awards of up to $2 million for information on
terrorist activities against Americans. It has led to the defection of
more than ten terrorist informants and the prevention of nearly a
dozen acts of terrorism against Americans. This program should be
publicized more widely in the Middle East. A recent report that a
valuable informant was treated shabbily by the U.S. government is
disconcerting because it could lead the trickle of informants to dry
up. (See Jill Smolowe, "A Hero's Unwelcome," Time, May 9, 1994, p.
50.) Informants who risk their lives to provide important intelligence
should be promptly rewarded for their efforts.
<P>
Reform immigration laws to improve internal security. 
<P>
     Sheik Abdul Rahman and two of the World Trade Center bombers
entered the country illegally. They eventually were caught but were
allowed to remain in the country pending subsequent legal proceedings.
This situation is intolerable. Congress should reform the immigration
laws to accelerate deportation proceedings and simplify and
consolidate the lengthy procedural hearings and appeal system that
permit illegal and undocumented aliens to evade immigration controls.
Applicants for political asylum should be screened to weed out and
immediately deport those without a credible basis for asylum.
<P>
     Tougher penalties should be imposed on the production or use of
fraudulent passports and visas. Nine of the original 35 indictable
counts in the 1993 New York bombing plots involved visa or passport
offenses. The recently passed crime bill contains a measure that will
double the maximum prison terms for such crimes from 5 to 10 years
(and increase to 20 years if the documents were used to facilitate
terrorism) and boost fines from $2,000 to $250,000. A companion
measure sponsored by Representative Gilman, which currently is under
consideration by the House Judiciary Committee, would allow the
government to seize the assets of criminals convicted of creating or
using false documents for terrorism or drug smuggling. If passed, this
measure would make it harder for terrorists to obtain false documents.
<P>
     Finally, the U.S. government should automatically deny visas to
members of groups that advocate, support, or participate in terrorism.
Unfortunately, the 1990 Immigration and Naturalization Act killed the
provisions of the 1952 McCarran-Walter Immigration and Nationality Act
that allowed the U.S. government to restrict the entry into the U.S.
of members of a group deemed a threat to U.S. security. The State
Department now wrings its hands over denying visas solely because of
membership in a terrorist group. This loophole, which puts the nation
at risk, needs to be closed. Congress should pass legislation that
enables the U.S. government to deny visas to foreigners because of
membership in terrorist groups rather than requiring proof of personal
involvement in terrorist acts, as is now the case.
<P>
Restore order in anarchic areas where international terrorist groups
thrive.
<P>
     Many of the World Trade Center bombers were supporters of the
radical Afghan group Hezbi Islami (Party of Islam) led by Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, a virulently anti-Western Islamic militant. Some reportedly
were trained in Hezbi Islami camps and fought in the Afghan war. The
U.S. should drop its short-sighted hands-off policy in Afghanistan
that has led it to remain neutral in the fighting between Hekmatyar's
Islamic zealots and the provisional government of President
Burhanuddin Rabbani. With a limited commitment of financial aid, the
U.S. can greatly strengthen the ability of the moderate Afghan forces
to defeat Hekmatyar's drive to transform Afghanistan into a
revolutionary Islamic state. By bolstering Rabbani's regime, the U.S.
could help end the anarchy that gives terrorists a foothold in
Afghanistan. (See James Phillips, "Winning the Endgame in
Afghanistan," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder Update No. 181, May 18,
1992.)
 <P>
    In addition, Washington should press Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to
end their support of Hekmatyar.
<P>
     The U.S. also should revive its efforts to build a stable and
independent Lebanon. Syria has sought to keep the Lebanese weak and
divided to assure its own dominance there. It has vetoed the efforts
of the Lebanese government to extend its control into southern Lebanon
and disarm Hezbollah. The U.S. should insist that Syria abide by the
terms of the 1989 Taif agreement, which require Syria to withdraw its
40,000 troops to eastern Lebanon and permit the Beirut government to
extend its control over its own territory. Only then will Lebanon
cease to be a staging area for international terrorism.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Middle Eastern terrorism has become more unpredictable and
audacious. Radical Islamic terrorists inspired by Iranian, Algerian,
and Egyptian revolutionary movements have overshadowed Palestinian
nationalist terrorists as a threat to the West. These new terrorists
often are supported by networks of radical Islamic activists who live
in Muslim communities in the West. Even more worrisome is the
training, arms, financial support, and guidance which radical Islamic
terrorists receive from such states as Iran and Sudan. 
<P>
     International terrorism is not likely to be eradicated, but it
can be weakened considerably if increased diplomatic, economic,
political, and military pressure is brought to bear on the state
sponsors of terrorism. The U.S. must lead an international campaign to
raise the costs of terrorism. This will require a coordinated, firm,
and relentless international effort. This kind of cooperation paid off
in disarming Iraqi terrorism during the Gulf War, and it can work
again. The U.S. must convince its allies that they now are involved,
whether they want to be or not, in an international war against
terrorism.
<P>
     To do so, the Clinton Administration must do more to stop
international terrorism. It must shelve its misguided plan to
downgrade the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism, toughen
its approach to terrorist states, and remain vigilantly on guard
against terrorist movements. Only then will its allies sacrifice their
short-term commercial interests to advance the long-term security
interests of the West and other targets of Middle Eastern terrorists.

 There was uncertainty over how  much this addition would restrict the White
House actions. While OMB Director Alice Rivlin  speculated that &quot;imminent&quot;
could rule out  funding of the Air Traffic Control System or  prison guards, for
example, the White House  finally decided that the ATC was a critical function.

<center><b>THE TOP FIVE REGULATORY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE 1995 WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SMALL BUSINESS</b></center><ul>
<p><li><b>Congress should amend the Regulatory Flexibility Act,</b> making it applicable to all federal agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Defense, to include cost-benefit analysis; grant judicial review of regulations; require small business representation; and require the use of negotiated rulemaking with small business representation.
<p><li><b>Congress should reform the Comprehensive Environmental Response,</b> Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) to apply prospectively as well as retrospectively to clean up sites. This includes eliminating retroactive and strict liability prior to January 1, 1987; and requiring sound science and realistic risk assessments to assess health and environmental hazards.
<p><li><b>Congress shall mandate a complete review of current laws and regulations relating to public health and safety,</b> such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act.
<p><li><b>Congress and the President should propose and enact legislation that reforms civil justice and product liability legislation</b> that include: 1) returning to a fault-based standard of liability; 2) eliminating joint and several liability; 3) limiting non-economic damages to three times the economic damages or $250,000 which ever is greater; and 4) providing for periodic, instead of lump sum payments for future medical or lost income.
<p><li><b>Congress shall enact legislation and appropriate enforcement</b> that includes: 1) requiring that all agencies provide a cooperative/consulting regulatory environment; 2) requiring that fines take into consideration the severity of the infraction; 3) requiring that regulatory agencies put the fines that they impose and collect into the general treasury fund to be used toward retiring the national debt; and 4) requiring that enforcement actions comply with American due process concepts.

important to note that the  company which buried the chemicals in the area, 
Hooker Electrochemical Company, encased them in a  thick protective tube of
impenetrable clay with  the intent of maintaining ownership of the land.
Unfortunately, the Niagara Falls Board of  Education, through threat of eminent
domain, effectively forced the company to sell the  land (for $1), despite the
company's warnings that the land was contaminated and not fit for  public use. A
public elementary school was built on the site, and city construction crews 
bulldozed through the clay seal, allowing the  chemicals into the surrounding
soil. Additionally, some of the land was sold off for  residential housing.
Thus, the problems at Love Canal  were the direct result of government
interference.

( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
Congress likely will consider legislation this year to reauthorize the 1980 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Superfund, as CERCLA is popularly known, only is one of the most complex laws now in force, but also is widely regarded as both wasteful and ineffective.  Even the Clinton Administration admits the program does not work.  One reason for is that, despite expenditures of between $20 billion and $30 billion, Superfund has failed to clean up more than a small fraction of the nation's worst hazardous waste sites.  Under the current law, cleanup of the remaining current and potential sites could cost additional tens of billions of dollars.
<p>
Fortunately, there is an opportunity for substantive reform in Congress this year. Senator Robert Smith (R-NH), Chairman of the
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Subcommitee on Superfund, Waste Control, and Risk Assessment, and Representative Michael Oxley (R-OH), Chairman of the House Committee on Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Hazardous Materials, early this session decided to undertake a top-to-bottom review of the program.<Font Size="-1">1</Font>  "If you recognize [Superfund] when we are done," declared Oxley recently, "we won't have done our jobs."<Font Size="-1">2</Font> 
<p>
Congress must correct the fundamental flaws in the current program,
not merely tinker with the statute as last year's bills would have done.<Font Size="-1">3</Font>  Reform should address the core elements of the Superfund structure that fuel litigation, slow cleanups, raise costs, and, most important, encourage the cleanup of sites that pose little risk to human health and safety and divert scarce economic resources from sites that may pose real dangers.
<p>
Specifically, Superfund reform should:
<ul>
<li>Encourage faster cleanups;
<li>Eliminate most of the need for lawyers and courts;
<li>Reduce total spending on CERCLA compliance;
<li>Be fairer to those who now pick up the tab for other people's pollution;
<li>Prioritize risks so that the most public safety possible is bought for the money spent;
<li>Encourage similar reforms at high priority state sites;
<li>Give states authority over a local problem;
<li>Give states funding to pay for their new responsibilities;
<li>Ensure public safety by continuing to allow immediate cleanup of sites that pose an imminent threat to human health;
<li>Reduce taxes on businesses;
<li>Encourage competitive bidding for cleanup work;
<li>Reduce total federal spending;
<li>Reimburse firms that have cleaned up sites under the current law for a portion of their costs; and
<li>Reduce potentially responsible parties' (PRPs)<Font Size="-1">4</Font> annual costs substantially.
</ul>
<p>
<b><a name="costs">LARGE COSTS AND FEW RESULTS</a></b><br>
( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
Superfund program was enacted after widespread press attention
to the exposure of residents to high levels of dangerous chemicals
Canal near Niagara Falls, New York.<Font Size="-1">5</Font>  Intended to force companies to clean up hazardous waste sites, the law also established a government fund to pay for cleanup of "orphan sites," which are contaminated properties where no responsible party exists -- where the polluter, for example, has gone out of business.<Font Size="-1">6</Font>  The law was hurried through Congress in the final days of the Carter Administration, and many provisions were ill-considered. Although estimates vary, most experts agree that the program has cost at least $20 billion while utterly failing to clean up most hazardous waste sites. Explains Carol Browner, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), "A lot of time and money is taken up with companies suing each other they owe to clean up a particular site."<Font Size="-1">7</Font>
<p>
Congress authorized $15.2 billion for CERCLA's trust fund during
the 1990 budget deal. Of this amount, $10.8 billion was spent
by the federal government through fiscal 1994.  The amount spent by companies and individuals to comply with CERCLA overall price tag by many billions of dollars.<Font Size="-1">8</Font>
<p>
Much of this cost has been spent not on cleanup, but on legal
fees and other "transaction costs."  And while program costs have ballooned, cleanups have proceeded slowly.  Only 291, or about 24 percent, of the 1,238 "worst" sites placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) -- have been cleaned up.<Font Size="-1">9</Font>  To clean up the remaining sites already on the NPL will cost the EPA alone an estimated $40 billion. A similar amount is estimated to be spent for state sites. If  the cost of cleaning up federal facilities is added to the equation, the total could exceed $750 billion, or about $7,800 per household.<Font Size="-1">10</Font>
<p>
<b><a name="super">SUPERFUND'S FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS</a></b><br>
( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
Superfund's combination of heavy cost and modest impact results
from four fundamental problems with CERCLA:
<p>
<ol>
<li>As written, the law is designed to reduce chemicals in the ground, not reduce risks to people;
<li>The program's unreasonable standards require that hazardous waste sites be cleaned up to a pristine level no matter what the location, resulting in a poor return on the investment;
<li>Hazardous wastes by their very nature are local problems, but listings, cleanup decisions, and program federal bureaucracy; and
<li>The law's retroactive, strict, joint and several liability scheme results in endless legal battles as potentially liable parties fight EPA, then each other, and shoulder the costs of cleanup.
</ol>
Each of these characteristics drives up costs while blunting the
effectiveness.  The reauthorization legislation must correct these flaws.
<p>
<b>Flaw #1: Cleaning up chemicals takes priority over protecting health.</b>
<p>
The most important question that should be asked in the reauthorization has not been asked in Superfund debates:  What should be the basic intent of the law? CERCLA was enacted amid fears that some Americans were at risk from hazardous wastes.  Yet the law was not designed specifically to reduce risk to the public. Rather, the goal was cleaning up spilled chemicals.

To be sure, cleaning up chemicals does help protect public health
if the sites being cleaned would expose the public to real risks.
But if there is no threat of risk to the public -- and there would be none without a land use change -- then money is squandered
that could have been used elsewhere to save more lives. Policymakers
take into account such "opportunity costs" spending decisions. As Heritage analysts have noted, "Policy makers generally fail to recognize the simple truth that using resources one way means not using them in other ways that could results....[T]hey ignore the benefits, including much greater possible reductions in risks to individuals, that could be achieved by using these purpose."<Font Size="-1">11</Font>
<p>
From a public health perspective, poor choices are made routinely
in the Superfund program. According to the Office of Technology
Assessment, the listing of most Superfund sites is based on hypothetical risks.<Font Size="-1">12</Font>  Economists Kip Viscusi and James Hamilton found similar results.<Font Size="-1">13</Font> Their study found that hypothetical potential future risks account for 90 percent of "risk-weighted pathways"
at Superfund sites.  For one-third of the sites studied, there is no current risk but only future risks. Moreover, for most of these hypothetical future risks, future generations would be at risk only if homes are built on sites that are not currently residential.<Font Size="-1">14</Font>
<p>
While it would seem prudent to protect against such potential
occurrences as the likely loss of clean aquifers or threats to
human health, actions to avoid hypothetical threats to life should
not have the same claim on already scarce resources.<Font Size="-1">15</Font>  Unfortunately, because Superfund is designed principally to clean up chemicals, the program costs a great deal but achieves little improvement in public health.<Font Size="-1">16</Font>
<p>
<b>Flaw #2: Overly stringent cleanup standards divert resources from more effective uses.</b>
<p>
The extremely high cost of cleanup is closely related to the question
of reducing risk. For the average site, the estimated cost is about $25 million, even though, as a category, hazardous waste considered by EPA to be a medium to low health risk.<Font Size="-1">17</Font>  The cost is so unnecessarily high because of overly stringent and inflexible cleanup standards for hazardous waste sites.
<p>
In addition to requiring expensive cleanups of sites that pose
little or no risk to the public, the standards require that sites
posing a real risk be cleaned up to a level that goes beyond what
is needed to reduce the risk to acceptable levels. For instance,
polluted soil at industrial park sites must be cleaned up to a
level that makes it essentially clean enough to eat. But while
may ingest contaminated dirt accidentally, or even purposefully,
few are likely to be found playing in the dirt at an industrial
park. 
<p>
Cleanup standards should reflect the real risk to a person likely
to be found at the site based on expected exposure, not on some
hypothetical and very unlikely scenario. An industrial park does
not need to be as pristine as a playground.
<p>
 In other instances, no risk exists unless there is some change
in how the land is used.<Font Size="-1">18</Font>  Often, the owners have no plans for development or current use.  Yet
rather than simply require a deed restriction that forbids change unless the site is cleaned up to a level appropriate for any proposed
change in use, the Superfund program requires the PRP to clean
up the site even if it poses no real risk as currently used.
<p>
Real risks also are not addressed in the most cost-effective manner.
instance, CERCLA's preference for permanent cleanup, as opposed
to ongoing treatment or containment, drives up costs for remediation
by discouraging containment and isolation. Blanketing layers of
plastic and clay on the soil, surrounding the property with a
fence, and posting guards might eliminate exposure to the public
for a small fraction of the cost of remediation. But this option
usually is not used.
<p>
Moreover, Superfund is structured so that states have a strong
incentive to demand unnecessarily strict cleanup standards. States
pay only 10 percent of remedial construction costs at fund-led
sites, but the law requires them to pay 100 percent of the Operation
and Maintenance (O&M) costs of such Superfund sites. Even
though periodic, ongoing treatment may be cheaper and may reduce
public exposure equally well, therefore, the states have a built-in
incentive to demand one-time, permanent, and extremely strict
cleanup standards so they can avoid future O&M costs.  Meanwhile,
companies responsible for paying for cleanup needlessly pay more.
<p>
<b><h4>Flaw #3:  The law does not permit local problems to be handled locally.</b></h4>
<p>
Perhaps the most puzzling feature of Superfund is that it is a
federal program. Indeed, CERCLA is not delegated to the states,
unlike all other major environmental laws. But hazardous waste
sites are, at their core, a local problem. If there is any federal
environmental law for which a legitimate case can be made for
devolving authority back to the states, it is CERCLA. Contrary
to the usual argument put forth by those who oppose shifting to
jurisdiction -- that states cannot be trusted to protect their
population -- state and local officials are far more accountable for local risks under their control than are distant federal officials. It is highly unlikely that states would neglect public health and safety concerns, especially given the general awareness and level of knowledge that exist today.
<p>
To deal with any possible problems associated with devolution,
certain safeguards could be built into the system. For instance,
emergency removals that target sites posing immediate and substantial risks could continue at the federal level. Since the EPA has extensive experience and is relatively efficient at emergency response to sites that are truly hazardous, it could maintain the capacity emergency responses.  This is not to say that the EPA emergency program is without its critics, but experience with this program generally has been better than with other parts of Superfund. Of course, safeguards would be needed to prevent abuse of what constitutes an emergency and to curtail the well-known problem of "bureaucratic creep."
<p>
There is another very important reason for returning authority
over hazardous waste sites to the states:  The Tenth Amendment to the Constitution reserves to the states all powers not explicitly granted to the federal government.The federal government should assume responsibility only for issues that are national in scope and interest. Federal involvement in the cleanup of local hazardous waste sites does not meet this standard. In fact, it is hard to imagine anything better suited to the exercise of state leadership and authority than local problems associated with the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.
<p>
<b><h4>Flaw #4:  The determination of liability leads to endless legal battles.</b></h4>
<p>
One of the most damning, though inaccurate, criticisms of Superfund
is that 80 percent of the money has gone to lawyers rather than
for cleanup.  This figure, commonly cited in the press, overstates the litigation costs severalfold, but the substance of the criticism is correct: Superfund's liability scheme encourages litigation and other transaction costs. Further, numerous "horror stories" of individual citizens and small businesses subjected to millions of dollars in potential liability for what most people would consider innocent acts, some of them committed generations ago. For instance, Russ Zimmer was named a PRP for a Superfund site at a battery
cracking plant in Torrington, Wyoming. His contribution to the problem? He sold a bag of dog food in 1977 and a bag of seed in 1984, and took a third-party check as payment for the items. Since the checks had issued by the now-bankrupt company that had owned the battery cracking plant, Zimmer was sued as a PRP by another company caught in CERCLA's liability scheme. Zimmer decided, on advice of counsel, that he should settle to avoid even more in legal costs. He agreed pay $3,500.<Font Size="-1">19</Font>
<p>
One of the major causes of such legal woes is the concept of joint
and several liability, under which even minor contributors to
a problem (for example, someone who tosses a car battery into
a landfill) can be held responsible for the entire multi-million
dollar cost of cleanup.<Font Size="-1">20</Font>
<p>
The concept is designed to find somebody -- anybody -- to pay for cleanup of hazardous waste, even if the "responsible" person has only a tiny part in creating the waste problem. In practice, this means that a firm with "deep pockets" ends up paying for the cleanup of wastes created by someone else.  Naturally, any person or institution identified as a PRP has a strong incentive to show that others are liable as well, in order to spread the costs among more PRPs. Litigation is virtually assured.
<p>
Faced with large and uncertain liability, PRPs typically protect
themselves by hiring lawyers. Thus, rather than quick payments
from "polluters," the liability scheme encourages legal gridlock, cleanup delay, and enormous legal costs. A recent report estimated total government, PRP, and insurer transaction costs of about $1.3 billion at NPL sites.<Font Size="-1">21</Font>  Although EPA Administrator Carol Browner has admitted the need for reform, she also claims that "a lot of come from the program.  The polluter-pays
concept that was first adopted in the Superfund law has changed
the way businesses deal with their waste."  But, Superfund "polluter-pays" system.  Joint and several liability merely guarantees that people like Zimmer pay for cleanup instead of those who are really responsible. In short, it works against the idea of making polluters pay the that their actions impose on others.<Font Size="-1">22</Font>
<p>
Perhaps the most controversial part of the liability scheme is
its retroactivity.<Font Size="-1">23</Font>  Retroactive liability
means that owners, operators, and other individuals and companies
otherwise liable under the strict, joint and several standards
are held responsible for pollution that took place before it became
illegal. For example, a company could be held liable for any pollution
that occurred before the Superfund law was passed in 1980. If
company made jeep parts during World War II, and during production some chemicals seeped into the ground, it would be legally responsible for cleaning up those chemicals though the manufacturing activity was legal at the time. Because of a law passed more than 35 years later, the company may face tens of millions of dollars in cleanup costs.<Font Size="-1">24</Font>
<p>
While retroactive liability is considered by many to be a violation
that "No... ex post facto Laws shall be passed," it also is simply unfair. Under the law as enforced, for instance, a farmer his grandfather -- or even some intervening owner of whom he has
never heard  -- fouled the sub-soil 50 years earlier using then state-of-the-art equipment.  The farmer must fix the entire problem, no matter how much it costs. But if he caused the problem himself back in the he be expected to know that his actions -- considered
legal and time -- might destroy his children's inheritance of
the family farm? Both environmental sensitivity and environmental knowledge have increased exponentially since that time.
<p>
Retroactive liability has triggered an avalanche of litigation
which probably is the biggest contributor to Superfund's failure
to achieve its primary objective of cleaning hazardous waste sites.
Perhaps the most important practical problem is that retroactive
liability increases the number of PRPs for any given site. Numerous
individuals and companies may have owned the land over the decades, each owner typically dealing with others who might also be considered liable. Since many owners and other potentially liable parties have poor records or no records at all for activities several
decades ago -- it is little wonder that those already targeted by the EPA challenge EPA about the remedies selected to keep costs down, pursue other PRPs to spread costs, and sue insurers to recover costs under old policies. 
<p>
In all, transaction costs account for approximately $1.3 billion
annually from all sources. According to the Rand Institute for
Civil Justice, the average cost for PRPs varies from 17 percent
depending on the size of the party held liable.<Font Size="-1">25</Font>  Reform of the Superfund program, however, should eliminate most of these huge transaction costs.
<p>
<b><a name="craft">CRAFTING A PROGRAM THAT WORKS</a></b><br>
( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
The political key to real reform is to end the infighting between
industry sectors over which will win and which will lose with
changes in the law.  The focus should be on benefiting all government  industry sectors so that, even if the mix of benefits is uneven, the least benefited sector or company is substantially better off under the new law. And to encourage states to accept responsibility for the program, a state fund should be created that is sufficiently attractive to motivate them to extend these reforms beyond National Priorities List sites to high risk state sites.
<p>
An effective Superfund reform proposal should increase fairness,
accelerate cleanups, reduce costs across the board, and more fully
protect the public from real risks. It also should reduce costs
so that no tax increase is necessary to fund the new Superfund
law -- even though retroactive liability would be eliminated for waste disposal at NPL sites before 1987.
<p>
Congress can accomplish these objectives by incorporating certain
features into this year's reauthorization legislation:
<p>
<b>1)  States should have authority over current "orphaned"  sites -- with funding.</b>
<p>
Rather than have the federal government clean up sites for which
no one else is liable, state governments should be responsible
for these costs.These sites, by their very nature, are local problems. Moreover, state governments likely are far more efficient than EPA in conducting cleanups. 
<p>
A revolving loan fund -- or direct payment fund -- or direct payment fund -- should pay for most of the projected cleanup costs transferred
to the states. Initially, the federal share could be perhaps 90
percent, to be scaled down over time. A revolving loan would constrain
the natural tendency to require that sites be restored to pristine
conditions. A higher state share, however, likely would have the
same beneficial effect.
<p>
States should be allowed to dedicate the funds to any of their
most serious hazardous waste sites, not just NPL sites transferred
government.  The condition would be that they enact the changes specified below, the most important being that they prioritize sites without regard to who for cleanup and spend the funds according to that prioritization.  Moreover, they should not use retroactive liability for financing at those sites where federal funds are used. They could continue, of course, to use any liability system they chose for other sites.  This would encourage flexibility and prioritization of cleanup.
It would also help states reach what should be their main objective:
reducing health-threatening risks to their citizens as effectively
and comprehensively as possible.
<p>
A revolving loan fund also should be available for cleaning up
sites.  Typically, businesses locate at abandoned industrial sites -- or
brownfields -- because of their legitimate fear of having to bear the cost of cleaning up hazardous wastes they did not create. So they tend to locate their new facilities sites that have had no previous industrial activity.  This neither makes economic nor environmental
sense.  For sites not currently on the NPL, states could use the revolving to encourage development whenever the need for cleanup causes the land to have a negative worth. In addition, EPA should be
prohibited from second-guessing state remedy and liability decisions
at such sites.
<p>
<p>
<b>2)  EPA should retain emergency cleanup capacity.</b>
<p>
Since the EPA is both experienced and relatively efficient at
emergency response to truly hazardous waste problems, it should
to conduct emergency responses.  To prevent abuses, each state would have the authority to decide whether a site constitutes an emergency. Either the state or a liable PRP would be required to pay for such cleanups through a cost recovery action.
<p>
<b>3) Standards for cleanup should be determined by the states, limited only by certain provisions of law that would be required to adopt to qualify for funding.</b>
<p>
Remedy and site selection standards generally should be left to
the states.
<p>
The states would have to agree, however, to prioritize sites according
to their real risk of human exposure, and to prioritize spending
risk reduced for every dollar spent.  This would give them the "biggest
bang for the buck" in protecting public health.
<p>
The states would be required to not use retroactive liability
(discussed in the following section) for all sites for which federal
funding is provided. Otherwise, they would have an incentive to
transfer costs to the private sector.
<p>
The states should be allowed to spend the new funds on cleanup
of non-NPL sites, provided they agree to extend the new liability
standards to that class of sites.
<p>
Adopting flexible performance standards and other remedy selection
changes would mean enormous savings on the cleanup portion of
total costs. Cost savings of 35 percent typically are estimated
by industry, although some experts believe the real savings could
be twice this amount. Adoption of these standards, however, should
not be made a condition of funding; responsibility for cleanup
costs without the use of retroactive liability, combined with
the funding condition of site prioritization, would encourage
state flexibility without specific standards.
<p>
<b>4) Reform the liability system.</b>
<p>
A more rational standard for assessing liability would:
<p>
<b>Eliminate joint and several liability.</b>  The courts generally have interpreted CERCLA to mean that anyone who has even a slight interaction with the site is liable for the whole cleanup costs.  This
creates a situation where a person or company whose actions caused little or no harm can be pursued for the whole cost of cleanup. Reform would make clear that liability is not joint and several, but instead proportional to a PRP's contribution. This would send the right economic and behavioral signals to the market, and liability would harness fight market forces. For the first time, the "polluter pays" principle actually would be put into practice.
<p>
<b>Repeal retroactive liability.</b>  Retroactive
liability makes people or firms responsible for activities that
took place in the past when they were legal.  Thus, for instance, a landowner is responsible for cleanup of hazardous at the turn of the century by a previous owner.  While the U.S. Supreme Court has not found that retroactive liability violates the Constitution's prohibition of ex post facto laws, holding people liable for actions taken before 1980 is patently unfair to those caught in its web and contrary to American notions of justice. Moreover, it is largely unnecessary. Repeal of retroactive liability, however, need not interfere with a private party's rights to sue for damages. Under the common law, if an action causes harm to a neighboring property, or a party contributes to a public nuisance, the party is liable under tort.
<p>
The date before which no liability would exist could either be
1981, when the original Act took effect, or 1987, when substantial
changes took effect. Even though the fairness argument is not
as obviously compelling for disposals before 1987 as it is for
before 1981, 1987 is preferable for a number of reasons.  The most important is that CERCLA is only a liability statute. It does not set rules for disposal. That is done by RCRA and other laws. These laws primarily took effect or were modified from 1980 through 1986. For example, RCRA's disposal and record keeping rules were extended to 175,000 more entities in 1986.  Unfortunately, many, if not most, companies reasonably believed or were legally advised that if they were in compliance with RCRA and the other laws, they could continue their disposal practices.  Yet these same companies are now liable under CERCLA for their innocent conduct. The 1987 date also is preferable for the sake of efficiency and lowering society's total CERCLA cost burden.  Until 1987, disposal rules for all parties were not clear and records under CERCLA are scanty. If the 1981 date is adopted, protracted court battles and slow cleanups would remain at a large of sites. State governments -- with funding -- would become responsible for cleanup of old "orphan" sites where PRPs are not liable under the new standard.
<p>
<b>Exempt remediation firms and trustees from liability negligence or willful neglect.</b>  These firms can become liable for problems associated with cleanup, "construction" firms willing to assume the risk of cleaning up problems caused by others.  While these firms
should be exempt from strict liability as a matter of law (using the common law standard of gross negligence and willful misconduct), PRPs also should be allowed to contract a greater degree of liability to
those cleanup firms willing to take the additional risk for higher
pay.
<p>
<b><a name="pay">WHO SHOULD PAY</a></b><br>
( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
One of the most contentious issues in the Superfund reform debate
concerns who should pay for cleanups. If retroactive liability
and joint and several liability are repealed, some level of government
responsible for those newly "orphaned" sites where contamination occurred before the cutoff date -- 1987 under this proposal.  For sites that the government cleaned up, the costs no longer
PRPs, but by the government entity -- state government under
proposal -- that decided the site ranked high enough to merit timely cleanup.
<p>
Since few states would rush to embrace reform that saddled them
with hundreds of millions of dollars in additional costs, a federally
supported state fund would seem reasonable if the program is devolved back to the states.  Where would the federal government obtain this money, and how large a fund would be necessary?
<p>
Currently, the trust fund has about $1.9 billion in annual revenue
and a  prior, unappropriated balance of about $2.5 billion that
is not obligated.  This fund has been raised through a variety of mechanisms, including annual taxes on petroleum (%557 million) and chemicals ($250 million) and a Corporate Environmental
Income Tax of $653 million.<Font Size="-1">26</Font>  These taxes
are set to expire at the end of 1995. In addition, Congress generally
has appropriated $250 million annually for Superfund, and federal
agencies have significant PRP liability at these non-federal facility
NPL sites.
<p>
Covering the expected additional costs to the states for accepting
for this program will require more than the unappropriated
currently in the trust fund. One solution would be to reauthorize
collection of taxes at current levels for the next several years,
slow phaseout of the federal fund could begin.  The costs to states should reduce over time in any event, since the number of NPL sites transferred to them would be fixed.  But there is intense debate over whether current tax levels could finance cleanups with retroactive liability repeal for all current PRPs.  The question is important
because taxes are not likely to be raised. Nor should they be. Indeed,
reform eventually should phase out taxes. But that does not preclude
reexamining either the current mix of funding or the budgetary
vehicle for collecting and spending this revenue stream.
<p>
Lawmakers should note that current Superfund taxes have been used
to fund programs unrelated to Superfund. Funding substantive reform
will require using these revenues to clean up hazardous waste
sites. If the financial flows into and out of the fund are sustainable,
program should be able to "pay for itself," the budgetary process.<Font Size="-1">27</Font>
<p>
The financial implications of repealing retroactive liability and joint and several liability were analyzed by National Strategies,
(NSI).<Font Size="-1">28</Font>  The Barents Group of Peat Marwick, which the study independently, found the analysis to be "carefully conducted, well documented, and to represent a fair assessment of the financial flows...."<Font Size="-1">29</Font>  NSI's conclusions help make the case for a substantive overhaul of Superfund.
<p>
One of the NSI report's key conclusions is that repeal of retroactive
liability for waste disposal that occurred before 1987 is achievable
with the current revenue stream without using the unappropriated
$2.5 billion currently in the trust fund.  The main reason is that significant inefficiencies would be eliminated through reform.<Font Size="-1">30</Font>  The report does not factor in the substantial benefits to be realized through risk prioritization or remedy selection improvements. Savings estimates vary from about 25-70 percent of cleanup costs, but even the more conservative estimates indicate that the amount would be significant.  These savings, as well as about $2.5 billion now in the fund, could be used for other purposes, such as a revolving loan fund for cleanup of state sites that are not on the federal NPL list.
<p>
The NSI report's financial conclusions suggest that, far from
being saddled with additional costs, states could be given access
to a loan fund for addressing waste sites now handled and financed
solely at the state level, since the current fund and expected
future savings not factored into the report would create a significant
pool of funds.<Font Size="-1">31</Font>  Under the proposal here, the only strings attached to the funds would be that states would have to prioritize state sites according to risk and not use their onerous liability laws, if applicable, for the sites high on the list for which federal funds would be provided. Put another way, no funds could be used for sites lower on the priority list unless retroactive,  joint and several liability is not applied to sites higher on the list.<Font Size="-1">32</Font>  A revolving loan fund would be available for cleaning up old industrial sites as well.<Font Size="-1">33</Font>  
<p>
Although the level of funding required to support reform would
depend largely on its structure, the total needed to implement
fully the recommendations outlined in this paper would be around
$2 billion annually. After several years, however, taxes or user
fees could be reduced to reflect anticipated savings. It is critical
that Congress appropriate to the reformed program all Superfund
tax revenue, the current general revenues appropriation, and at
least the annual interest on the current unappropriated trust
fund balance.
<p>
<b><a name="conl">CONCLUSION</a></b><br>
( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
Superfund is broken. If it is to be repaired, it must be completely
overhauled. Federal agencies, state governments, municipalities,
and the private sector must be relieved of the ill-conceived,
unnecessary, and expensive burdens of the program. Specifically,
the reformed CERCLA should at least:
<ol>
<b><li>Turn authority for current NPL sites over to the states  -- with the necessary funding.</b> To qualify for funds, states should be required to meet two conditions.
<ul>
--Prioritize sites and expenditures based on real risks. <br>
--Eliminate joint and several liability completely and retroactive liability for wastes disposed of before 1987 for sites cleaned with federal funds.
</ul>
<b><li>Allow states to use funds for any of their most serious hazardous waste sites, not just NPL government.</b>  These conditions would have to apply, or states would be tempted simply to spend the money on sites for which they were responsible rather than on those that are most dangerous.
<p>
<b><li>Create a revolving loan fund for cleaning up old industrial sites.
</b>
<p>
<b><li>Allow EPA to retain emergency cleanup capacity.</b>
</ol>
If substantive reforms of this nature are not enacted, Superfund
will continue to be an ineffective and expensive drain on the
American economy. But if proper reforms are instituted, Congress
can achieve its original goal of protecting Americans from hazardous
wastes at reasonable cost.

<li>It is important to note that the company that buried the chemicals in the area, Hooker Electrochemical Company, buried them in a thick protective tube of impermeable clay with the intent of maintaining ownership of the land. Unfortunately, the Niagara Falls Board of Education, through threat of eminent domain, effectively forced the company to sell the land (for $1), despite the company's warnings that the land was contaminated and not fit for public use. A public elementary school was built on the site, and city construction crews bulldozed through the clay seal, allowing the chemicals into the surrounding soil. Additionally, some of the land was residential housing. Thus, the problems at Love Canal were the direct result of government interference. <p>

<li>Retroactive liability is not expressly provided for in the text of CERCLA, but it is clear from the usage of the past tense that Congress intended it to be retroactive.  Moreover, the courts have interpreted that the intent of the law was to impose retroactive liability.<p>
<li>For many defense contractors, liability has amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars.<p>

<li>NSI, <i>The Costs of Superfund: A Financial Analysis</i>.<p>
<li>Budgetary barriers such as "pay go" should be avoided.  Since taxes expire at the end of the year, future revenues should be raised as user fees applied primarily to industries which have generated pollution.  Not only would this be more consistent with the original reason for raising revenues from corporations -- to finance the cleanup of problems caused by their industries -- but it would avoid unnecessary and arbitary budgetary barriers that would threaten reform.<p>

<li>Barents Group of Peat Marwick, "Review of the National Strategies, Inc.  Report:  <i>The Costs of Superfund: A Financial Analysis</i>," June 13, 1995.<p>
<li>For instance, repealing the liability scheme as well as devolving authority back to the states would mean shifting the costs of cleanup to the government, but saving from this shift also would occur.  With repeal of retro active, joint and several liability for pre-1987 sites, PRPs could expect to save $1.8 billion per year, much of which would not be passed on to government because fully 32 percent of current expenditures -- ranging from 17-60 percent depending on the size of the firm -- are wasted on leagal and other transactionco.  Yet the vast majority of these transactions costs would disappear since they are caused primarily by the liability scheme.  Transaction costs amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars incurred by EPA and the Department of Justice could be reduced and redirected to cleanup.  Similarly, other EPA overhead could be cut and redirected to cleanup.<p>
<li>The amount of anticipated savings could be withheld from the initial fund payments, which is not done now.<p>
<li>Some 40 states adopted CERCLA's liability scheme.<p>
<li>The NSI analysis specificaly assessed and compared the "financial flows" of Superfund under current law and the proposal crafted by Superfund '95(SR '95), a coalition of 600 local governemnts, small and large businesses, and insurers.  The NSI reported simply examines the financial flow of of implications of repealing joint and several liability and retroactive liability proir to 1987, but its financial analysis aupports the more dramatic reforms proposed here because the costs indentified would decrease substantially after a few years with remedy selection reform.  However, the costs under SR '95 and the Heritage Foundation approach would not differ significantly since both propose repeal of the liability scheme, which is a driving cost factor, inaddition to sharing some other key components.  Indeed, the proposal here should be less costly.<p>

Bureau  of Labor Statistics CPIUX1. It should be noted that the Senate Finance
Committee Advisory  Commission To Study the Consumer Price Index has determined
that the CPI overestimates the  increase in the cost of living from 0.7 to 2.0 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  percentage points. This in turn
has misled Members of Congress and President Clinton  into thinking that GDP,
productivity, and real  wages have grown more slowly than they really  have.
Indeed, without the upward bias in the CPI, real wages would have grown
significantly  since 1983 instead of stagnating.

Bill Pierce employed 25 salaried  professionals in his midwestern engineering
consulting business. Mr. Pierce also allowed  his workers to work flexible
schedules. During an investigation, the Department of Labor  declared that the
opportunity of flexible  schedules transformed Mr. Pierce's salaried workers 
into hourly employees subject to the FLSA's overtime provisions. DoL then
demanded that  Mr. Pierce pay his workers back overtime pay and penalties. The
result: Mr. Pierce had to  declare bankruptcy, and his employees lost their
jobs.

<b>AN EXAMPLE OF THE BREAKDOWN OF SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS: WASHINGTON, D.C.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Because Washington, D.C., is a unit on which federal statistics are available, and because of the city's out-of-wedlock birth rate with all its concomitant costs and effects, it already illustrates where the rest of the country is heading. These statistics -- some of the best available on any of America's urban areas -- dramatically illustrate the breakdown of our social institutions.
<p><b>Illegitimacy:</b><ul>
<li>In 1990, the percent of births to unmarried women in Washington, D.C., ranked as the very highest in the nation -- 64.9 percent of all births, 25 percentage points higher than Mississippi's second highest ranking of 40.5 percent.
<p><li>In 1990, the percent of births to teenage mothers in Washington ranked as fourth in the nation -- 17.8 percent of all births. For the highest-ranking state, Mississippi, the figure was 21.3 percent.
</ul><p><b>Abortion:</b>
<p><li>In 1988, the abortion ratio -- the number of abortions per 1,000 live births -- in Washington, D.C., was 1,248, the highest in the nation. In the second-highest state, New York, the number was significantly lower: 629 abortions per 1,000 live births.
</ul><p><b>Infant mortality:</b><ul>
<li>In 1990, the infant mortality rate in Washington, D.C., was the highest in the nation: 20.7.</ul><p>
<b>School performance:</b><ul>
<li>Per pupil public primary and secondary education expenditures: $8,057 - Rank: 2
<p><li>Pupil to teacher ratio: 14.4 to 1 - Rank: 1
<p><li>High school graduations: 60.2 - Rank: 49th out of 51
<p><li>SAT combined scores: 849 - Rank: 49th out of 51
</ul><p><b>Poverty:</b><ul>
<li>In 1989, Washington, D.C., ranked ninth in terms of individuals living below the poverty line with 16.9 percent.
</ul><p><b>Public welfare expenditures:</b><ul>
<li>Washington's 1991 per capita public welfare expenditures ranked as the very highest in the nation at $1,156.57.
<p><li>The city's per capita public welfare expenditures also exceeded those of other major U.S. cities:<ul>
<li>Washington, D.C.: $1,156.57
<li>New York City: $891.44
<li>Boston: $220.53
<li>Chicago: $34.68</ul></ul>
<p><b>Income tax:</b><ul>
<li><b>Top personal income tax rates:</b> Washington, D.C.'s top personal income tax rate ranks seventh-highest in the nation at 9.50 percent.
<p><li><b>Total taxes:</b> Overall, Washington's 1991 per capita taxes ranked second-highest in the nation at $4,036.83.<ul>
<li><b>Sales Tax:</b>  Rank: 3 - $755.15
<li><b>Income Taxes:</b> Rank: 1 - $1,253.08
<li><b>Property Taxes:</b>  Rank: 1 - $1,474.71
</ul></ul><p><b>Crime:</b><ul>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Nothing illustrates the nature of the breakdown of communities better than a story from Mrs. Elayne Bennett, who runs a very successful program for young girls in the poorer part of Washington D.C., that helps them get their lives on track and avoid teen pregnancy. One of the young women working in her organization, Best Friends, was being courted by a good young man. Mrs. Bennett was looking forward to the wedding so that the girls could be invited to the church. None of them had ever seen a wedding. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	With illegitimacy rates so high for so long, a high proportion of the District of Columbia's young men have no fathers at home, or grandfathers at their grandmother's home. The boys have no real men in their lives. It is no wonder they end up in jail and out of work. The same story is repeated in all of America's major urban centers.

from an analysis of adoption studies. Clinical  studies traditionally have shown
adopted adolescents to be overrepresented in  psychiatric settings. The same
occurred here, but the  adolescents were found not to have emotional or
psychological problems. Adopted adults are  less likely to receive treatment
than the general population. This seeming contradiction  occurs because adoptive
parents are more likely to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  refer their adopted children for
possible treatment. Of all adopted children referred by  parents for clinical
treatment, only 27 percent had a clinical diagnosis. The remainder   almost 75
percent  received counseling for normal adolescent issues. Kathleen S.  Marquis

</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="4">4</A></B></TT>     Clearly,
not all persons in the  lowest income quartile will receive welfare  benefits,
and some benefits will go to individuals  in higher income groups. Overall,
however, a reasonable estimate would put the total number  of recipients of
meanstested aid at about one quarter of the U.S. population. Thus, Charts  3 and
4 give a reasonably accurate picture of welfare spending relative to the
recipient  population.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="5">5</A></B></TT>     For
purposes of consistency,  federal meanstested education aid is included with
welfare spending in the comparison. This  sum equaled $17.3 billion in 1993, or
5 percent of total welfare spending; shifting these  funds out of welfare and
into education would not materially affect the comparison in Chart 6.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="6">6</A></B></TT>     For
purposes of consistency, Medicare  spending on poor persons has been included in
the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  welfare category rather than in
the Medicare category. See the discussion under Medicare  in Rector and Lauber,
<CITE><U>America's Failed $5.4  Trillion War on Poverty,</U></CITE> Appendix
One. This  sum amounted to $15.5 billion in 1993; it represents 4 percent of
combined Medicare and  Social Security payments and 5 percent of total welfare
spending. Shifting it from the  welfare category to the Social Security and 
Medicare category would not significantly affect  the comparison in Chart 6.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="7">7</A></B></TT>     The cost of
military production and  military and civilian personnel in World War II  was
$315 billion (in 1940s prices). See Alan S. Milward,

Angeles: University of  California Press, 1979), p. 64. Slightly lower war cost

<P><TT><B><A NAME="8">8</A></B></TT>     The figure
on business infrastructure  in Chart 8 equals the net value of tangible
nonresidential fixed assets in  privatesector business and industry in 1993. The
figure  includes the value of all plant, structure, and equipment in the
following industries: all  manufacturing, all construction, all transportation,
all utilities, all communications,  all

retail trade, all business real estate, all hotels and  lodging, and all other
service industries. Agriculture, forestry, and fisheries have not  been

equals the value of welfare  benefits from different programs for the average
mother on AFDC.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="17">17</A></B></TT>    
Technically, the mother may be married  to a husband who works parttime at very
low wages and still be eligible for some aid under  the AFDCUP program. However,
if the husband works a significant number of hours per month,  even at a low
hourly rate, his earnings will be sufficient to eliminate the family's 
eligibility for AFDC and most other welfare.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="18">18</A></B></TT>     One
simplistic solution to the  dilemmas presented above would be to allow a 
welfare mother to retain all or most of her  welfare benefits after she has
taken a job or married  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  fully employed male. But this
approach would be unfair to working single mothers  and lowincome working
married couples who never went on welfare in the first place.  Moreover, low and
moderateincome parents would have  a huge incentive to enroll in welfare, at
least briefly, to become eligible for the  longterm continuing benefits. Such a
system would  devolve inevitably into one in which the majority of low and
moderateincome single  and twoparent families received substantial welfare
payments, raising the overall cost  of welfare by hundreds of billions of
dollars per year. Realistic welfare reformers must seek  to alter welfare
incentives in a more practical manner.

</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="42">42</A></B></TT>     For
example, modest work requirements  on males in the food stamp program have been
shown to reduce welfare rolls significantly,  cutting welfare costs by nearly a
third and immediately saving several dollars in welfare  expenditures for every
dollar spent operating  the work program. See data on the San Diego food stamp
workfare program in U.S. Department  of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service,
Office of Analysis and Evaluation,

</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="43">43</A></B></TT>     There
should be no blanket twoyear  exemption from work requirements. Work
requirements which are imposed when a recipient  initially enrolls in welfare
are likely to have the strongest possible effect in reducing  welfare rolls
because they dissuade individuals from enrolling in welfare in the first  place.
Thus, serious work requirements mandated at the time of initial welfare
enrollment  are likely to be the most costeffective workfare programs.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Philadelphia, federal judge Norma Shapiro prevents judges from detaining many violent defendants before trial by prohibiting them from considering a defendant's prior criminal record, mental-health history, or drug dependency. The federal court also refuses to allow any pre-trial detention for such "non-violent" crimes as stalking, carjacking, robbery with a baseball bat, burglary, drug dealing, vehicular homicide, manslaughter, terrorist threats, and weapons violations. State and local judges in Philadelphia are prohibited from forcing defendants to appear at trial, and the city now has 50,000 fugitives from justice. Instead of being in jail, these individuals have gone on to commit numerous other crimes. Between 1994 and June 1995, Philadelphia police rearrested 9,732 of these criminals (previously released under federal court orders) for 79 murders, 959 robberies, 2,215 drug deals, 701 burglaries, 2,748 thefts, 90 rapes, 14 kidnapping charges, 1,113 assaults, 264 gun-law violations, and 127 drunk-driving incidents.

<a name="chicken">CHICKEN LITTLE IN REVERSE</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bad news to the contrary notwithstanding, a small group of educators who are getting increasingly favorable play in the media are beginning to argue that the bad news is not bad news at all -- what is bad are the people (mostly conservatives) who report the bad news. A full-length book devoted to this subject, The Manufactured Crisis, was reviewed by the New York Times as though it were accurate (suggesting that even Times reviewers do not always read the books they are asked to review).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On December 22, 1995, The Washington Post ran an op-ed, "US Students: Better Than Ever." Author Gerald A. Bracey, a professional critic of the critics, argues that things have never been better, that "scores on many commercial achievement tests" and "the proportion of students scoring above 650 on the SAT mathematics test (on the old scale)" are "at an all time high." He does not tell the reader that commercial achievement test scores are the classic example of the "Lake Woebegone effect," named for Garrison Keillor's mythical town where the "children are all above average." Nor does he tell the reader who is pushing the SAT math scores higher (mostly Asian and Asian-American students). The real issue, of course, is not whether scores are higher or lower, but whether they are high enough. To say that higher is better is no different from saying that a 1970 Ford is better than a 1950 Ford; it may be true, but it is irrelevant.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
No responsible educator or policy analyst believes that today's academic performance is good enough. Indeed, the sharpest critic of American academic performance is none other than Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Candidates for public office should not be fooled by fatuous assertions that test scores are "climbing" or that "kids today know more than kids did a generation ago." The problem is they still do not know enough. Today there is much more to know, which is all the more reason to demand more of the system.

<p>

<a name="anyone"> ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS SCHOOL DISCIPLINE AND HIGH ACADEMIC STANDARDS CAN'T BE ALL BAD </a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Albert Shanker, President of the American Federation of Teachers, has launched the AFT on a high-profile national campaign in support of high academic standards for all children and school discipline, primarily to protect the integrity of the learning environment. According to recent surveys and analyses by the Public Agenda Foundation, most Americans support straightforward academic standards and discipline. They believe increasingly that the problem is not in "somebody else's school" but in the school their children attend.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Incredibly, other elements of the education establishment not only refuse to support Shanker, but actively oppose him and the AFT program. The Council of Great City Schools sent a letter to Shanker denouncing his program, asserting that members would not support such initiatives in their districts and arguing that "if these concepts are the unpinning's of educational [sic] reform... we seriously doubt that the national education goals will ever be met." According to Teacher Magazine, Shanker said the letter is "a justification of the current, failing system," adding that "the reasoning embodied in this letter is exactly what has given us school systems where children fear to come to school." The AFT deserves to be criticized for its position on school choice but should be commended for its position on discipline and standards.
<p>

<a name="isthe">IS THE EDUCATION CRISIS A FRAUD?</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<I>"A small group of outraged revisionists charges that a cabal of highly placed conservative leaders has conspired, with the help of the media, to destroy America's public schools."</I>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus opens the lead article on a new book, <I>The Manufactured Crisis,</I> by David Berliner and Bruce Biddle in <I>Teacher Magazine</i> for November-December 1995. The article shows why modern education is in so much trouble. It has been taken over by people like Berliner and Biddle, who apparently cannot think, write, or even develop a convincing conspiracy theory.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Berliner and Biddle charge that former U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennet and former Assistant Secretaries Chester E. Finn and Diane Ravitch, among others, have conspired to defame and ruin American public education through "organized malevolence." Such charges utterly trivialize a serious and well-intentioned debate by trying to demonize serious reformers. The book embodies a major irony, too subtle to be apprehended by its authors: As Ron Wolk, editor and publisher of <I>Teacher Magazine,</I> notes, "By defending the present system against an imaginary conspiracy and demolishing straw men they created, Berliner and Biddle distract attention from the central question ... and may make it harder to bring about the fundamental change needed if the system is to survive."

<a name="vouchers">VOUCHERS IN MILWAUKEE</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Milwaukee is the home of a nationally recognized voucher plan for low-income children. Spearheaded in 1990 by State Representative Annette "Polly" Williams, a Democrat, and signed into law by Governor Tommy Thompson, a Republican, the plan permits up to 1,000 low-income Milwaukee students to use an annually adjusted amount ($2,967 for the 1994-1995 school year) in state funds to attend a private, non-sectarian school of their parents' choice. The Milwaukee program began operation during the fall of 1990 with 300 children using vouchers at 6 private schools. In 1994, the program expanded to 832 students attending one of 11 participating private schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	In response to an August 25, 1995, Wisconsin State Supreme Court injunction halting Governor Thompson's expansion of the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program to include religious schools, residents of Wisconsin donated more than $1.4 million, as of September 22, 1995, to help give the children of Milwaukee the ability to stay in the private schools chosen by their parents. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The campaign to keep these children in school was led by Partners Advancing Values in Education, Milwaukee's privately funded scholarship program. Of the $1.4 million raised for the fund, $1 million came from the Bradley Foundation in Milwaukee and $75,000 was donated by the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The court's ruling left more than 2,300 children stranded after they already had signed up for classes in religious schools. They await the court's final ruling on the lawsuit that brought on the injunction, which was backed by the state and local teachers' unions and the American Civil Liberties Union.


<p>
<a name="charter">A CHARTER SCHOOL IN ACTION</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yvonne Chan, founder of the Vaughn Street Next Century Learning Center in Los Angeles, runs one of the most promising charter schools in the nation. Once part of the burdensome bureaucracy of the Los Angeles City Unified School District, the old Vaughn Street School won a $750,000, three-year, RJR Nabisco Next Century School Award five years ago. Thus empowered to act independently, Chan began significantly improving the education of her students and drawing the community into the life of the school. In 1994, Vaughn Street enjoyed a $1.2 million "windfall," the administrative overhead that the central office-HQ used to claim. The per-pupil allotment now goes directly to Vaughn Street, which spends the money on program improvement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of Chan's most dramatic accomplishments was the removal of a crack house next to her playground. Before Vaughn Street became a charter school, all Chan could do was call the police. Dealer and users would scatter, only to return within hours. As head of a charter school, Chan was able to buy the crack house, and, with the PTA's approval, hire a bulldozer and level it one Saturday afternoon. She plans to extend the playground into the newly vacant lot.

of American elementary and secondary education, there is not a single  columnist
who writes a regular column about it for  the national media or news services.
Yet elementary and secondary education spends more  than $280 billion a year,
enrolls 44 million youngsters, and employs 3 million teachers (and  an equal
number of janitors, cooks, crossing guards, and so on). At the same time, the 
only nationally circulated magazines for and about education (other than union
magazines)  have tiny circulations. The best, <CITE><U>Education  Week</U></CITE>,
hovers around 60,000 subscribers a year.  The AFT's Shanker communicates with
