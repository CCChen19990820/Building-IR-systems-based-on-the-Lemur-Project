MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>.  I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight 
on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are presenting some very important facts 
about homosexuality and marriage.  You will hear from 
experts who have examined the ramifications of destroying 
marriage to reshape it with same sex unions.  From 
psychiatrists to educators, Family Research Council brought 
experts together in a briefing on Capitol Hill to present 
their findings to the media and our country's legislators.

<p>

We will also see a clip from the news conference 
where grass roots leaders presented their views on changing 
marriage.  Why is this an issue?  Because aggressive 
homosexual activists have tried to change America through a 
court case now pending before liberal judges in Hawaii.  
That case could come down in August.  If you want to 
understand this radical change, stay tuned.

<p>

But first we bring you Gary Bauer, president of 
the Family Research Council, a long term expert on values 
discussions and a leading conservative political analyst.  
Let's here Gary's opening remarks.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing,  broadcast July 
2, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. BAUER:  As the 20th century draws to a close, 
the United States finds itself in the middle of some fairly 
profound debate on a whole host of issues, and I suppose 
that is the way it should be in a democratic republic like 
ours.  The people ought to be debating the most important 
issues of the day.

<p>

We all are aware of the great debate taking place 
on the size of government and how big Washington ought to 
be.  As conservatives, we believe that Washington is too 
large and that bureaucracy is too extensive and it ought to 
be cut back.  There is a great debate taking place on the 
question of taxation, and once again, I think the issue is 
pretty clear.  I believe that the American people, American 
families, American workers, are overtaxed and that 
Washington, D.C. is overfed and needs to tighten its belt.

<p>

We are having a gigantic debate at the end of this 
century on the question of America's role in the world.  We 
were reminded of that again this week when once again flag-draped 
caskets came back from Saudi Arabia.  Whether it is 
Bosnia or Haiti or Somalia or Saudi Arabia, Americans will 
be debating for a long time our proper place in the world, 
where it is we should show the flag, and for what we will 
ask young men and women to pay the ultimate sacrifice.

<p>

These are all important issues.  They are all 
things that in a democratic republic the people must debate.  
But there is also a whole group of issues that are also 
important and profound, and I would argue in many ways even 
more profound than the issues I just mentioned to you.

<p>

They are issues that relate to values and to 
virtue and how it is that free men and women ought to live, 
what the purpose of our liberty is.  A little over 200 years 
ago, our founding fathers meeting in this week of the year 
debated these issues, and to a man they believed, whether 
they were Christian or agnostic or deist, they all believed 
that only a virtuous people could remain free.  There is a 
lot of evidence that in the last 30 years in the United 
States, we are setting out to prove the founding fathers 
wrong.  The culture mocks virtue in many ways.  Many people 
in Washington think that virtue is an outdated concept.

<p>

I am always marveling in events around the world 
how Americans will with great pride begin to chant "we are 
number one."  I have chanted that myself watching Olympic 
events or other events, but the fact of the matter is that 
the United States has become number one in a lot of things 
that ought to bring shame rather than honor.  Whether the 
issue is half of our marriages ending in divorce or a third 
of our children being born out of wedlock or the incredible 
amounts of pornography or child abuse or drug addiction, by 
many, many measurements the United States has moved away 
from virtue, and as a result, I think, is in deep, deep 
trouble.

<p>

One of those issues related to the role of liberty 
and the role of virtue is this issue of marriage and how 
define it.  For over 5,000 years of civilization, marriage 
has been defined as the bringing together of two individuals 
from opposite sexes.  It has always been defined that way in 
civilizations that are influenced by the Judeo-Christian 
value system, and I believe that clearly in America today 
the overwhelming majority of the American people, by most 
polls 80 percent, still understand and believe marriage to 
be the bringing together of a man and a woman.  Yet, we find 
ourselves in 1996 needing to debate this basic idea.  We 
need to debate it because the cultural elite of America 
seems confused about it.  We need to debate it because a few 
unelected judges in Hawaii are in danger of redefining a 
marriage for the whole country.

<p>

I would like to spend my time discussing and 
debating other issues, and I think it is terribly 
distressful that in the latter years of this century we have 
to debate such a basic concept.  But debate it we will.  We 
believe that this issue of how marriage is defined and the 
broader issue of the nature of our liberty and how it should 
be used are the most profound issues facing the United 
States as we go into the next century.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Act press 
conference held June 24, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. HEKMAN:  We are kind of forced into this 
particular arena, not because this is a choice on our part 
that we have to glom onto this particular issue at this 
time, but because there is a decision in Hawaii, far-off 
Hawaii, of an obscure court there that has the implication 
or the possibility of impacting laws across the states, the 
other 49 states.  So we would suggest to you that without 
one vote being taken in the state of Michigan by the 
legislature, without even a court decision in the state of 
Michigan, that Michigan's laws that have existed since we 
were a state would significantly change in a very 
undemocratic method.  There is no more undemocratic method 
than such as this where an obscure court makes a decision 
significantly impacting the law in the state of Michigan in 
a particularly important area.  Few people deny that the 
definition of what marriage is is incredibly important to a 
culture.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.  In FRC-sponsored Defense of 
Marriage briefing, Dr. Jeffrey Satinover, a psychiatrist and 
author, stated some key findings that have a great impact on 
society's view of homosexuality.  Dr. Satinover is a former 
fellow in psychiatry and child psychiatry at Yale, past 
president of the C.J. Young[?] Foundation, and holds degrees 
from MIT, the University of Texas, and Harvard University.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing follows.]

<p>

DR. SATINOVER:  There is certainly no instance 
anywhere in history, including ancient pagan cultures, where 
the proposition has been put forward that there is a 
reasonable basis for society in anything other than the 
union of a man and a woman for the purpose of establishing 
the family.  Now the fact that that has been historically 
true, of course, speaking as a scientist, does not mean that 
it inevitably must be true.  It is conceivable that we may 
be holding onto dearly cherished opinions for 3,500 years 
which are in fact mistaken, but the burden of proof rests 
with those who would in fact alter traditions such as those.

<p>

Central to this debate is the question of 
homosexuality and what it is, and it has long been known 
among proponents of an activist agenda that it is crucially 
important to alter public opinion and public sentiment on 
the question as to the nature of homosexuality before one 
can successfully make an argument to alter the family 
structure so as to include homosexuality as a reasonable 
part of it.

<p>

Thus, quite some time ago, 15 or 20 years ago, a 
series of studies were done to examine a key point.  Let me 
read you a portion of one of these studies.  To measure the 
relationship between beliefs about the determinance of 
homosexual orientation and attitudes toward homosexuals, 745 
respondents in four different societies were queried about 
their beliefs, and the following point emerged.

<p>

Analysis indicated that subjects who believed that 
homosexuals are born that way held significantly more 
positive attitudes toward homosexuals than subjects who 
believed that homosexuals choose to be that way and/or learn 
to be that way.  There is a well-known public relations 
effect to be had from making the claim that homosexuality is 
innate, genetic, and -- the key point -- therefore 
unchangeable.

<p>

Now there have been in the last 6 or 7 years a 
series of studies.  There is a broad awareness of three 
different kinds of studies that have been put forth, largely 
by the media, as demonstrating the fact, the supposed fact, 
that homosexuality is innate, genetic, and unchangeable.  
Those studies fall into three categories.  One are brain 
changes.  The other are family or so-called twin studies, 
and the third is the search for chromosomal linkages.  The 
nature of all of these studies that have been done on 
homosexuality demonstrate a biological component to it that 
is intrinsically no different than the kind of biological 
component you would find if you examined basketball players.

<p>

Now here is how that works.  First of all, brain 
changes.  Most people presume that the brain does not 
physically change as a consequence of behavior, and that is 
an old idea.  The truth is the brain changes dramatically as 
a result of behavior.  When this was first put forth as an 
argument against brain changes, studies, the studies that 
were done, a wisecracking commentator made a remark about 
only fundamentalists believing that. 

<p>

However, the editor of <i>Nature</i>, probably the 
world's premier scientific journal, commenting on that 
research himself, said plainly the neural correlates of 
genetically determined gender are plastic structures in the 
hypothalamus and could allow the consequences of sexual 
arousal to be made permanent.

<p>

A clear example of how this happens:  in 
individuals who become blind as adults and then learned 
Braille, the part of the brain governing the right index 
finger became progressively enlarged.  What we do with our 
lives not only changes our character and our personality, it 
will also have an effect in the brain.

<p>

Second, twin studies.  The most widely touted set 
of studies supposedly show that among identical twins there 
is an increased incidence of either both being homosexual or 
both being heterosexual such that it points to a genetic 
determination of homosexuality.  Now, first, I am going to 
read you two paragraphs from the very study that is cited as 
evidence.

<p>

The opening paragraphs:  these studies were 
designed to detect heritable variation, and if it was 
present, to counter the prevalent belief that sexual 
orientation is largely the product of family interactions 
and the social environment.  Now you will notice that this 
is a scientific study being done for a political purpose, 
which of course is not right to begin with.

<p>

Nonetheless, this is what the authors concluded:  
although male and female homosexuality appear to be at least 
somewhat heritable, environment must also be of considerable 
importance in their origins.  Now that paragraph from their 
study is never quoted in public.  In fact, other 
commentators, other scientific commentators, have said very 
clearly -- for example, two authors from Harvard and the <i>MIT 
Technology Review</i>; both are geneticists; one is the head of 
the largest genetics faculty in the country.

<p>

While the authors -- referring to the same study -- while 
the authors interpreted their findings as evidence 
for a genetic basis for homosexuality, we think that the 
data, in fact, provide strong evidence for the influence of 
the environment.  Now there are science writers currently 
going around saying that there is absolutely no argument on 
the point that homosexuality is genetic, and that is flatly 
wrong.  The majority of well-informed behavioral geneticists 
understand that the current research only shows a heritable 
influence, which is not terribly specific, and that most of 
the research actually demonstrates the opposite of what is 
being claimed.

<p>

Now heritable influence is something that I will 
explain very briefly, but before I do, let me also quote you 
from the author of the most widely cited study on 
chromosomal leukogens[?].  This is the study about which 
major news weeklies headed across their cover "Gay Gene," 
and you may have seen another one on a related topic about 
adultery, "Adultery, In Our Genes?"

<p>

When pressed by scientists to explain the 
discrepancy between the way his findings were being reported 
and what his findings actually demonstrated, this author 
said the following:  the relationships among genes and 
environment probably have a somewhat different effect on 
someone in Salt Lake City than if that person were growing 
up in New York City, i.e. liberal Manhattan, conservative 
Utah, difference in outcome as to whether an individual is 
or is not going to be homosexual.  The bottom line of that 
statement is a clear acknowledgment that the social 
environment has a dramatic effect on the incidence of 
homosexuality.  What does it mean for something to have 
genetic influence or genetic linkage or genetic association 
or heritable influence?  It does not mean what most people 
think it means.  Most people do not understand enough about 
behavioral genetics to realize that that phrase means almost 
nothing, and a good behavioral geneticist will tell you that 
heritable variation is a meaningless finding.

<p>

Here is what it means.  If you look at a group of 
basketball players, you will find, first of all, that their 
brains are different than the brains of non-basketball 
players, because those areas of the brain responsible for 
repeated basketball playing will have grown larger.

<p>

Point number two.  If you look at family studies, 
you will see that if one identical twin is a basketball 
player, even if the second twin is raised in another family, 
the second twin is also likely to be a basketball player, 
not because there is a gene for basketball playing, but for 
the simple reason that height and athleticism are factors 
which are inherited and which will make basketball playing 
more likely.  Therefore, if the one is, the other is.  The 
principle here is that heritable variation points only 
toward intermediate traits which themselves need not have 
anything to do with the subject you are studying.  So for 
example, it is quite possible that the intermediate trait, 
which predisposes to homosexuality or intermediate traits, 
would include such things as sensitivity, shyness, a 
tendency to be more interested in the world of the mind.  I 
would not be surprised, in fact, if intelligence itself, to 
the extent that it has a heritable component, correlates in 
the same way with homosexuality.

<p>

I cannot give you evidence to prove that, because 
the political process has prevented the kind of reasonable 
scientific studies that should be done on this subject, 
especially considering how many people struggle with it.

<p>

Change.  There were about 50 years of outcome 
studies on treatment of homosexuality using a variety of 
modalities.  Some of those methods, we have come to believe, 
are inappropriate and should not be used, but the majority 
of methods are simply psychotherapeutic.  They involve 
nothing more than talking and exploring the underlying 
sufferings that help give rise to homosexuality in 
vulnerable individuals.

<p>

Here is an example, just one study, with long-term 
follow-up.  Of 49 patients who were able by a previous 
therapy to control their homosexuality, 63 percent were 
contacted for follow-up.  The average period since the end 
of treatment was 4 years.  Nineteen -- 61 percent -- have 
remained exclusively heterosexual.  There are more details 
of this.

<p>

If you look at outcome studies up until the 
American Psychiatric Association basically killed off the 
field by removing homosexuality from the DSM as a diagnosis, 
you find a consistent result of anywhere from 25 to 75 
percent success rate, with an average rate of success of 
over 50 percent.

<p>

Now I will close by making the following 
observation.  If you look at the heavily funded program 
aimed at changing high risk sexual behavior among at-risk 
homosexual males, you find a long-term success rate just in 
changing the dangerous behaviors which is actually somewhat 
worse than the results for changing sexual orientation 
altogether.  Given that epidemiologists now acknowledge from 
multiple studies around the country that among 20-year-old 
men who identify themselves as gay, 30 percent will either 
be HIV-positive or dead of AIDS by the time they are 30, 
even if a success rate of 10 percent were available, it is 
in my view morally reprehensible that we are not making a 
determined effort to do everything possible to help people 
leave homosexuality who wish to.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Act press 
conference held June 24, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. MANSFIELD:  Public opinion drives public 
policy, whether it is in Washington, D.C., or in Boise, 
Idaho, or New Jersey.  It does not matter where you are at.  
Public opinion drives public policy.

<p>

In fact, the New Jersey ACLU just this past week 
stated it is a shame that we have some radical heterosexuals 
who are activists who want to create special rights for 
straight people.  We felt in Idaho that if moms and dads who 
attend soccer practices, who put their babies to sleep, who 
wake up every morning and take care of things, that if they 
are radical extremists, then somebody somewhere is out of 
line.

<p>

Now ladies and gentlemen, supporting the 
prohibition of same sex marriage, it is not unkind and it is 
not uncompassionate.  From the heartland of Idaho, it just 
makes sense.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are presenting 
the recent Defense of Marriage Briefing on Capitol Hill.  
Dr. Hadley Arkes, professor of jurisprudence at American 
institutions at Amherst College and contributing editor to 
major national publications, takes a look at what would 
happen if we changed the definition of marriage in the 
context of the law.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing, 
broadcast July 2, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. ARKES:  I want to take a moment to remind the 
press and the public about what it is that created a certain 
urgency for the Defense of Marriage Act.  It was not merely 
the litigation percolating in Hawaii, because that had been 
going on for along time.  Matters had to move along quickly 
because there was an awareness of <i>Romer versus Evans</i>, the 
Colorado case then pending before the Supreme Court.  When I 
testified on May 15, we were expecting that case any day, 
and it turned out it was decided on May 20.  It was quite as 
bad as many of us anticipated it would be.

<p>

The court in that case struck down a 
constitutional amendment in Colorado that refused to treat 
gays and lesbians as a protected or favored class.  We will 
hear, of course, many different accounts of that case, but 
in my own reading, that case will be read by many activists 
among the judges to produce this lesson, that a state may 
not incorporate anywhere in its laws or public policy an 
adverse judgment on homosexuality, and it may not refuse to 
accord to homosexuality the same standing or legitimacy that 
attaches to that sexuality imprinted in our natures.

<p>

With this move, the court may have armed federal 
judges to tie up any legislation in a state that refused to 
honor homosexual marriages.  After all, the argument could 
run that the state refuses to credit this marriage only 
because of the gender or the sexual orientation of the 
couple.  Would this not be then on its face but another 
discrimination directed at gays and lesbians?

<p>

When we look at <i>Romer versus Evans</i> and how that is 
complicating the situation, we do not have to be confined to 
speculation.  We simply follow the precise warning cast up 
by Justice Scalia in his dissenting opinion.  As Scalia 
pointed out, the Association of American Law Schools now 
require all of their members to extract this pledge from law 
firms that are interviewing candidates that the employer 
would be willing hire homosexuals.

<p>

At the same time, the Supreme Court has now 
declared in the <i>Romer</i> case that the people who hold to the 
traditional Jewish and Christian teaching on sexuality are 
fueled by an irrational animus.  Now as far as I know, no 
moral court has managed yet to refute the traditional Jewish 
and Christian teaching on this ancient problem, and yet the 
court has now pronounced that teaching to be vacuous, to be 
connected to no plausible or defensible purpose.

<p>

As Scalia has observed, the court now declares 
serious Christians and Jews to be nothing less than bigots.  
So as we put these strands together, they start pointing in 
this direction.  Is there not an incentive now for law firms 
to gauge whether senior partners or young associates harbor 
views that may put the firm at odds with the regulations 
bearing on the law schools.  While affecting no prejudice, 
mind you, toward people who are serious about their 
religion, the law firms may nevertheless screen out people 
who acknowledge their seriousness as Christians and Jews.

<p>

And the incentives will not emanate simply from 
the conventions of the law schools.  After all, if the 
Supreme Court itself has now declared that a moral objection 
to homosexuality is indefensible, irrational, the 
distillation of an unreasoned prejudice or animus, does the 
court not in fact install the predicate for grievances and 
litigation?

<p>

If the young gay associate is denied standing as a 
partner, could it not be claimed now that the climate in the 
firm was poisoned from the outset or set in a discriminatory 
cast by the presence of senior partners who bore moral 
reservations about homosexuality, and what could be said 
about the law firms could be said even more forcefully about 
the colleges and the universities, and given the litigious 
experience these days in the academy, we can virtually count 
on the fact that grievances will be filed.

<p>

What if a member of an academic department has 
simply done what I have done, given testimony in public or 
published an article staking out a position, reaching a 
moral judgment on some of these questions, on gay marriage?  
Might that supply a prima facic[?] route for a grievance 
later?  Might it not be argued -- in fact, won't it be 
argued that the situation was at least biased or tilted from 
the very outset by the presence of that member of the 
faculty?

<p>

Can we not then expect certain kinds of pressures 
to suggest that his presence during the process of tenure 
would be inappropriate?  Perhaps his presence during the 
hiring process would be inappropriate.  In fact, being 
prudent about these matters, it might be better simply to 
forestall the problem at the root by failing to hire people 
of this kind who generate problems later.  Some of what you 
have here in <i>Romer versus Evans</i> is a rather clean device for 
purging from the professions and the universities those 
people who are overly religious, overly serious about the 
traditional teachings of Judaism and Christianity.  It is a 
very powerful weapon.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Act press 
conference held June 24, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  When Missouri found itself in the 
unconscionable position of having to defend marriage in 
response to the situation in Hawaii, the legislators began 
to hear such things as this legislation is unnecessary, or 
come on, guys; we do not need this shameful hate-mongering 
in our state, and as the debate began to rise, the same 
issue began to come up time and again, and we also began to 
hear things like this is not a gay issue, this is not a 
homosexual issue, but this issue is being brought to the 
forefront by this radical right.

<p>

I am here to submit to you today that those two 
components come straight out of the pages or the playbook, 
if you will, from the same sex marriage proponents.  In its 
manual <i>To Have and To Hold</i>, the National Gay and Lesbian 
Task Force sets forth their legislative agenda, and it reads 
rather simply:  stall the bill, shepherd it into less 
hostile committees, define the bill to the press and 
politicians in terms of benefits or strategy, and they go on 
to say to urge politicians to say the bill is unnecessary or 
that we do not need this shameful hate-mongering in our 
state.

<p>

In addition to that, the other side of the 
argument was that this issue was not being brought up by the 
homosexuals.  In fact, several testified that they were not 
really ready for same-sex marriage, that they had not really 
had a chance to think this out.  In its manual Lambda puts 
forth in the marriage project, it calls the case in Hawaii 
and several other cases, its case.  They go on to say that 
for the last 5 years they have been working on these cases, 
forum shopping for judges, working with law students, 
lawyers, and people across the states to bring this back and 
make it a state by state issue.

<p>

So as we began to look at that in Missouri -- it 
is the old don't tell me show me state -- we began to look 
more and more at some of the things that were occurring 
across the United States, and we were not alone, and as 
people began to step up to podium you began to hear things 
like history proves that no society which has ever redefined 
sexual morality outside of one man one woman marriage has 
ever survived, and we began to look around us and to see 
things in our own culture that led us to believe that the 
culture in Missouri and perhaps the culture in America would 
not fare any better than any prior civilization's.

<p>

So as a result, the Missouri General Assembly 
overwhelmingly passed language in defense of marriage.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We will now hear from Robert 
Knight, FRC's Director of Cultural Studies.  Bob examines 
the legal, social, and cultural ramifications of same sex 
marriage on our society.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing, 
broadcast July 2, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Most Americans believe in the 
philosophy of live and let live.  I do not think there is 
any widespread sentiment for persecuting homosexuals in this 
country.  As a matter of fact, they have achieved an 
enormous deal of tolerance.  But what they are trying to do 
now is go beyond that tolerance and to harness the power of 
the law and of corporations increasingly to force 
affirmation of homosexuality on those who disagree with the 
idea that it is healthy and normal and moral.

<p>

If homosexual marriage is legalized -- and I use 
marriage in quotes, because it is a non sequiter; there is 
no such thing as homosexual marriage, marriage being the 
union of a man and a woman -- this would create a situation 
where people who are of devout Christian, Jewish, or Muslim 
beliefs, or if they are atheists who just happen to think 
that marriage ought to be between a man and a woman, find 
themselves outside the law.

<p>

We will have the prospect of business people being 
forced to subsidize homosexual relationships or face legal 
sanction.  We will face the prospect of children being 
taught that homosexuality is normal in school, because how 
could they be taught otherwise if the state sets aside 
status and privileges that make homosexual relationships on 
a par with marriage?  The reason marriage has special 
benefits built in at the legal, cultural, and social levels 
is because it is indispensable to the survival of 
civilization.  No other institution does for civilization 
what marriage does.

<p>

While homosexuals say they only want tolerance, 
they are being dishonest, I believe, about that.  They are 
quite intolerant with anyone who disagrees with them, and if 
you do not think that is true, ask the Boy Scouts of 
America.  They are under legal attack in states where the 
gay rights laws are already on the books, and the Scouts are 
basically being told you abandon the moral traditions that 
you have had for 80 years in raising boys to be men, and you 
have place homosexuals over young boys on camping trips, or 
we will see that you face legal ruin.  We will litigate and 
litigate until you cry uncle.

<p>

Mind you, the Scouts are a private organization, 
and that parents in a free country ought to be able to 
entrust their children to an organization that reflects 
their most deeply held beliefs.  One would think in a free 
country they could do that, but gay activists do not think 
so.  They want to force their agenda right into the Boy 
Scout troops.  That is tyranny.  That is not tolerance.

<p>

Here is an example of where we are headed if the 
gay rights movement is not turned back.  In Hamilton, 
Ontario -- and I got this out of an article by David Fromm 
in a Canadian magazine -- in Hamilton, Ontario, gay 
activists came to the mayor, and they said, look, we want 
you to issue a proclamation to celebrate Gay Pride Week.  
Now Hamilton is a blue collar Catholic town, and the mayor 
has no ax to grind with gays, but he said, look, I don't 
think this would sit well with most of my constituents, and 
I just don't want to do it.

<p>

He was hauled before a Human Rights Commission 
under the gay rights law, and he was fined personally 
$5,000, and the charge was that he was sowing hatred and was 
gay-bashing, merely for not celebrating what most of the 
people in Hamilton considered something immoral.  That is 
where we are headed with gay rights.  That is the real 
agenda.  You celebrate it, you affirm it, or we will bring 
legal sanctions against you.

<p>

Homosexuality has been discouraged in all cultures 
in all eras, because it is destructive.  The truth should 
finally be told about it, but what you read in the media is 
not what the gay lifestyle is all about.  I was in the media 
for 15 years as a reporter and editor, 7 of them at the Los 
Angeles Times, and I can tell you that in those news rooms 
all across America, there is a reluctance to deal with the 
behavior of homosexuality, with scientific studies that 
contradict the major claims of gay activists, particularly 
in the genetic area, and to propagate certain myths that 
move the agenda along.

<p>

In a brief time, I would like to go through some 
of those myths.  The 10 percent myth, that 10 percent of the 
population is homosexual.  That stems from the discredited 
Kinsey studies of the 1940s.  It has not been replicated, 
and there are 30 reliable studies from around the globe 
showing that it is under 3 percent and more probably under 2 
or 1 percent, and yet you still see it used.

<p>

The genetic studies.  Dr. Satinover addressed 
them.  Suffice it to say you can drive a truck through these 
studies.  The twin studies, in particular, for identical 
twins show that if half of them are not gay, then how can it 
possibly be genetic.  If you know what identical twins are, 
it is the exact same genetic material.  These studies, if 
anything, undercut the claim that there is a genetic 
component.

<p>

Gay teen suicide, and you will probably hear more 
about this later from Pete LaBarbara[?], there is this claim 
that one in three teen suicides is gay.  That came out of a 
single report in 1989 by a gay activist named Paul 
Gibson[?].  His report was repudiated by Louis Sullivan, the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services, and it has been 
criticized deeply by experts in the field like David 
Schaeffer[?] of Columbia University, and yet you see it used 
constantly to justify programs in public schools.

<p>

Psychological studies.  In the 1950s, a UCLA 
psychologist named Evelyn Hooker[?] gathered 30 homosexual 
men and 30 heterosexual men and put them through some 
psychological tests.  She was trying to prove -- and she 
told interviewers later -- trying to prove that gays were no 
different from non-gays.  In two of the three tests, the 
gays were picked right out by the independent judge.  They 
sexualized everything in the tests.

<p>

Yet, that is never revealed in the media.  The 
media keeps saying, well, these studies of Evelyn Hooker 
show that gays are no different; they are normal.  That 
study was the major piece of evidence cited in 1973 when the 
American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from 
its list of disorders.  This is bad science, and it has been 
used in a very political way.

<p>

Finally, gay parenting studies.  We hear them all 
the time in the quest for expanded adoption opportunities 
for gays.  If you look at all of these studies, they have 
tiny sample sizes, 8 or 9 people.  Most of the people know 
each other in the other study groups.  The people were 
recruited by gay activist publications, and the studies are 
done by lesbian activists.

<p>

But even with all of that, if you add up the 
children in all these studies, the weight of evidence shows 
that the children are four times as likely to either have a 
homosexual orientation later in life or to experiment with 
homosexuality.  Doesn't that make sense?  Children model 
their behavior after their parents.  Why would we be 
surprised that kids in gay households might try homosexual 
sex?  After all, if mom and mom are doing it, or dad and 
dad, why not the kids?  This is a threat to children.  It is 
a way to lead them into a destructive behavior that will 
diminish their lives.

<p>

The language of gay rights is tolerance.  We just 
keep hearing that word.  We hear diversity also misused.  
But the aim is raw power, to basically criminalize dissent 
on this issue.  If you are identified as an opponent of gay 
rights, you are going to have a rough time.  That is across 
the board in this country now, and it has to stop.  The 
truth should be told about homosexuality, and that is that 
it is changeable; it does not lead to a happy life; there is 
a way out; and more people should know about it.

MS. DEALY:  Society has long recognized that men 
and women are different.  They bring different strengths, 
different perspectives, different ideas, and different 
insights into relationships, and when they are combined as a 
unit, there has the strongest building block for all 
society, but especially for the effects that that has and 
what that brings to children, and even in California, where 
anything goes and there is rare consensus on public policy 
issues, there is overwhelming support for traditional 
marriage.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.  We now bring you the impact 
legalizing same sex unions would have on your children at 
school.  Linda Page, a former school principal, education 
consultant and writer, presents what she has already seen 
take place due to homosexual activism and her prediction on 
what that would look like nationally.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing 
broadcast July 2, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MS. PAGE:  As we look at what the education scene 
is about, without being denigrating or without in any way 
diminishing the role of dedicated caring teachers, we see 
that we have folks that jump on bandwagons right and left.  
We see a culture in education that is driven by whatever the 
latest thing is.  That comes from the fact that teachers are 
the kind of people who want to make a difference with 
students.  They go into education because they want to 
prepare them to have better lives.  So they are always 
looking for better ways of doing things, and they are always 
looking for more effective things that will work.

<p>

Why do we have these people who find themselves in 
situations that really actually bring harm to students?  We 
have state and federal mandates that educators are bound to 
fulfill.  We have local mandates that educators are bound to 
fulfill.  Take, for example, the Rainbow Curriculum in New 
York City a few years ago.  That caused a major public 
outcry, because we had activists there who wanted to make 
certain that every child had positive self-esteem regardless 
of the kind of family they came from.  That relates very, 
very specifically to same sex marriage.

<p>

I brought a copy of one of the books that I would 
like to share a few pages with you from.  This book is 
called "Heather Has Two Mommies," and this is the kind of 
thing as we move toward a bandwagon which would ensue if we 
have federal mandates or state mandates that would result 
from same sex marriage being legalized and having the force 
of law behind it.  This is the kind of thing that we could 
expect in our primary children's classrooms.

<p>

This is Heather.  She lives in a little house with 
a big apple tree in the front yard and lots of tall grass in 
the back yard.  Heather's favorite number is two.  She has 
two arms, two legs, two eyes, two ears, two hands, and two 
feet.  Heather has two pets, a ginger colored cat named 
Ginger Snap and a big black dog named Midnight.

<p>

Heather also has two mommies, Mama Jane and Mama 
Kate.  A long, long time ago before Heather was born, Mama 
Jane and Mama Kate were very good friends, only they weren't 
mommies then; they were just Jane and Kate.  Kate lived on 
one side of town with Midnight, and Jane lived on the other 
side of town with Ginger Snap.

<p>

After they were friends for a long, long time, 
Kate and Jane realized that they were very much in love with 
each other.  They decided they wanted to live together and 
be a family together.  So Jane and Kate and Midnight and 
Ginger Snap all moved into the little house with the big 
apple tree in the front yard and the tall grass in the back 
yard, and they were all very happy, except for one thing.

<p>

Kate and Jane wanted to have a baby.

<p>

I am not going to finish reading this, but this is 
the kind of book that we could expect in our classrooms for 
primary readers if we have same sex marriage legalized.  
What we can expect overall if this situation takes place is 
a complete overhaul of curricula in general, staff 
development programs, teacher training programs, textbooks.  
We can expect an erosion of parental rights.

<p>

What we will see are kids who have already been 
instilled with values clarifications notions, which says 
that all values are equal, which is a totally ludicrous 
thought when we consider the horrific Saudi Arabian bombing 
last week.  All values are not equal, but our kids will be 
indoctrinated and immersed in a culture and in rhetoric and 
in education curricula which completely changes their view 
of themselves and of the world, and it is absolutely 
essential that we protect our kids who are very, very tender 
and very pliable from this danger.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Act press 
conference held June 24, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. CLARK:  Same sex marriage is now prohibited in 
the state of Illinois.  It has been signed by the governor.  
The majority vote in the House was 83 in favor of this bill 
prohibiting same sex marriage and 12 against.  In the 
Illinois Senate, 43 to prohibit same sex marriage, and 7 
against.

<p>

Any time we have gotten into debates about welfare 
reform, criminal justice, inevitably these kinds of issues 
look back to what are the causes of some of the problems, 
and it is broken families time and time again.  So the kinds 
of issues that had sensitized our general assembly had 
already been talked about.  Intact families are the best 
place for kids, and to think that all of a sudden we are 
going to destroy this concept of marriage that has been the 
basis of our societal stability for hundreds, probably 
thousands, of years, was outrageous.

<p>

MR. OSTRANDER:  The fact is that each of us and 
each of us in the context of our families live in a cultural 
ecosystem, and this ecosystem, I think, is more fragile than 
we care to note.  The fact is several years ago William 
Bennett did shed some light on it in his index of leading 
cultural indicators, and with that report, what we saw was a 
kind of toxicity in our culture.  What I am referencing is 
the rate of divorce.  I am referencing promiscuity of all 
kinds.  I am referencing spousal abuse, child abuse, 
substance abuse, illegitimacy, poverty, any number of 
things, all of which should be looked at as a toxicity to 
the health and well-being of our families.

<p>

When an ecosystem is threatened to this degree, 
the environmentalist is not content with a redefinition of 
the ecosystem or a redefinition of what we use to measure 
the health of that ecosystem.

<p>

We must not at this time redefine marriage and 
redefine family.  We must, instead, put our efforts to 
strengthening the family, the tried and true, the 
traditional, that which has for generations given us layer 
of leadership after leadership that could move freely in the 
realms of government, in the realms of business, in the 
realms of the spiritual, in all realms.

<p>

We simply cannot allow a small handful of judges 
whose ideas about the family are different, far different, 
from the average American's to dictate to the rest of 
America what the American family is and what it should be 
and what it will be for generations to come.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we continue the presentation of 
our recent FRC-sponsored Defense of Marriage Briefing, which
took place in the Capitol Building before a distinguished
Hill audience.

<p>

This is especially timely because of the House's 
critical vote in which the Defense of Marriage Act passed by 
a vote of 342 to 67.  Now the battle moves to the Senate.
To understand the issues at play, we will show some experts 
who present crucial information regarding the impact 
legalizing same-sex marriage would have on children, their 
development, school curriculum, adoption law, and our places 
of worship.

<p>

You will be introduced to a former homosexual who 
now devotes his life and his ministry to helping those who 
would like to escape the homosexual lifestyle, and we'll 
hear from leaders of grass-roots organizations talking about 
the impact changing marriage would have on the states.

<p>

Tonight's show promises to be an informative one, 
full of exclusive information and facts that the media does 
not usually divulge.

<p>

We will begin with Anthony Falzarano, executive 
director of Transformation Christian Ministry.  Anthony, a 
former homosexual, truly understands the destructiveness the 
lifestyle brings into a person's life.  Let's hear what he 
had to say about his own experience and views on same-sex 
marriage.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Briefing, 
Capitol Hill, July 2, 1996 follows:]

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  My name is Anthony Falzarano.  I 
am the executive director of Transformation Ex-Gay Christian 
Ministries in Washington, D.C.  We are the Washington, D.C., 
affiliate of Exodus International, which is the largest ex-gay 
network in the world.  We have over 120 ministries 
worldwide, and we offer hope to the repentant homosexual 
community.

<p>

We are one of four ex-gay networks in the world, 
and currently there are over 200 ministries to help 
homosexuals who desire to leave the gay lifestyle behind.

<p>

The United States of America has taken a dangerous 
moral nosedive in the last 35 years, and it is time to say 
enough is enough to the enemies of this country that have 
been allowed to infiltrate the halls of Congress with their 
voices of destruction.

<p>

The politically motivated homosexual community in 
this country has stepped over the line.  This movement is 
extremely well funded and well connected.  It has been 
working for the last 30 years like an army of termites, 
secretly eating away the floorboards of moral integrity in 
this country.  It is time to expose the agenda of these gay 
political organizations.

<p>

The gay community shocked us in the 1970s by 
coming out of the closet.  They gained our sympathy in the 
1980s with the horrible pandemic called AIDS.  And they are 
now trying, in the 1990s, to force our acceptance of this 
lifestyle using the legal systems of this country.

<p>

I speak to you today not as an observer of the 
homosexual community but as one of them.  I am a former 
homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle from the time I was 17 
until the time I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle 
thinking that there really wasn't any choice for me.

<p>

What I didn't realize is that although I didn't 
choose to be homosexual, I did not have to be gay; that I 
had a choice; that I could change my orientation from gay to 
straight, and that is what Exodus did for me nine years ago. 
I am now happily married and I have two children, and only 
by the grace of God, after having over 400 sexual partners, 
I am HIV negative.

<p>

My healing process was a long and difficult one.
However, change is possible.  The four national ex-gay 
networks are currently ministering to over 10,000 former 
homosexuals, and our phones are literally ringing off the 
hooks.  We are growing in leaps and bounds.

<p>

Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle that 
initially seems very freeing but eventually puts us in all 
kinds of bondage and eventually kills us.  I have lost over 
35 of my friends and acquaintances to the disease of AIDS, 
and I don't want to see one more person contract this deadly 
disease.

<p>

The organized gay community in this country is 
telling us that AIDS is no longer a gay disease, and 
although it is spreading into the heterosexual population in 
this country very quickly, the facts are, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control, that 61 percent of people that 
have AIDS are homosexual men.

<p>

America needs to start helping homosexuals recover 
from sexual brokenness.  Eighty percent of the people that 
come to Transformation have been sexually molested and/or 
raped as children.  Homosexuals are victims.  Homosexuals in 
most instances do not bond with their same-sex parent, and 
we need to start helping homosexuals.  We must love the 
homosexual and hate the sin that they are involved in.

<p>

Putting a stamp of approval on this lifestyle by 
legally recognizing it and even calling it marriage is not 
really helping homosexuals; it is perpetuating a false myth 
of happiness.  Many people believe that if I can marry, then 
all of my problems concerning homosexuality will be over.
That is a myth.

<p>

QUESTION: I have a question for Mr. Falzarano.
What brought about your personal transformation, if you 
don't mind going into that, and a little bit more about the 
transformational ministries and what they do to help the 
homosexual transform?  I am curious about that.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  My past life is very public, so I 
don't mind sharing any detail of it.

<p>

Basically, one of the strong motivations, 
obviously, was my conversion to Christianity.  I began to 
look at the Holy Scriptures and see that Jesus says, if you 
love me, you will refrain from all sexual immorality, and, 
obviously, I was highly promiscuous.  Not all homosexuals 
are, but there were a large amount of my friends that were.

<p>

So I began to look at my personal life and 
realized that I had to clean up my act.  And then I got 
married 12 years ago, thinking that that would cure my 
homosexuality, because there was not help like there is 
today and I had no one to go to, so I thought, well, I would 
do the right thing and get married, and that would surely 
cure my homosexuality.

<p>

One third of the people we help at Transformation 
are married men and women, so we know that marriage does not 
cure homosexuality.  I needed to look within myself, and 
that is what Exodus helped me look at.  I was a victim of 
sexual abuse as a child; I was sexually molested five times 
as a child.

<p>

I had a physically present father but a 
psychologically absent father.  He was there every night.
My parents were married for 50 years.  On the surface it 
looked like a great marriage, and it was a decent marriage, 
but my father was psychologically unavailable to me.  Those 
were some of my root causes.

<p>

So when I came to Exodus, I had to deal with a lot 
of those issues, a lot of anger inside, especially directed 
to my perpetrators.  Forgiveness -- I had to look at my 
father and my mother, look at the reality that with seven 
children they had a full plate and that he did probably the 
best that he was able to do.  So a lot of forgiveness in 
that area.

<p>

I had to stop my physical acting out.  I was 
addicted to masturbation and pornography.  Many homosexuals 
are, male homosexuals.  I had to put aside all of my 
addiction and get some therapy for that to understand why I 
was falling into that kind of behavior.

<p>

And as I began to lay all of that aside in my life 
and deal with those issues, I began to have proper sexual 
attraction to my wife.  I can say now that we have quite a 
successful marriage after 12 years.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Press 
Conference, National Press Club, June 24, 1995, follows:]

<p>

MR. PAULTON: Why are South Dakotans so decisive 
about this issue?  First, they understand that, throughout 
the course of history, marriage has been the foundation of 
society.  It uniquely brings the sexes together to form the 
foundation, the framework for the family.

<p>

In South Dakota we believe that our most precious 
resource is the family.  As Joe mentioned, with all of the 
dysfunctions, the social dysfunctions that we see around us, 
this is no time to toy with the very building block of the 
family.

<p>

Secondly, this is also a state's rights issue.  As 
has been said very well here, this is a decision that should 
be left to the people of each individual state.  The people 
of South Dakota have spoken clearly on this issue, and their 
elected officials have spoken clearly.  That decision should 
rest with each individual state, not with a few people in a 
far-away Hawaii court.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. In the FRC-sponsored Defense 
of Marriage Briefing, Dr. Brenda Destro focused on the 
potential ramifications that same-sex marriage would have 
upon teen sexuality.  Dr. Destro, who served as a social 
work consultant for the U.S. Department of Health and 
Services, shares her experience regarding child sexual 
identity development and the same-sex debate.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Briefing of 
July 2, 1996, continues:]

<p>

DR. DESTRO:  Before I talk about the relationship 
between sex education and homosexuality, I want to just give 
you a little background on sex education, which was 
originally a product of the public health community as a 
method of primary prevention or education to help sexually 
active teens prevent pregnancy, usually using medical 
technology.

<p>

Even though these programs and the evaluation 
studies that have overseen them for the past probably 20 
years have continually shown that sex education has little 
or no impact on teenage pregnancy, it has continued to 
expand in both its approach and its audience and is now 
widely available in public and private schools throughout 
the United States.

<p>

So the sex education programs that many, many, 
many, many teenagers are participating in now happen to be 
the primary mechanism with which most teens learn about 
sexuality, learn about pregnancy, very little about 
marriage, and now homosexuality.

<p>

Those political people who are advancing a 
homosexual rights and the same-sex relationship rights 
agenda actually have very little regard for the 
developmental needs of the preteens and teenagers in our 
society, and it is very evident in these widespread sex 
education curricula which are offered to 10- all the way 
through 18-year-olds in most of the public schools 
throughout our country.  The subject of homosexuality, along 
with other topics, is included in most sex education 
curricula, more as a politically correct thing to do and not 
necessarily balanced with the cognitive, emotional, social, 
and moral needs of the children who participate, and, I 
believe, having harmful results.

<p>

As homosexuality and same-sex relationships are 
further sanctioned, these topics will be given even greater 
recognition and higher profile in sex education curricula, 
and I believe this will result in even more harm.

<p>

I am going to talk about maybe the work of the 
developmental theorists, Pieget(?), Erikson, Kohlberg(?), 
all people whose work is probably the basis of most of what 
is learned in the public education system.  But they believe 
that there are distinct differences in personality and the 
way we think and the way we socialize and even in our 
morality, and that is true among children and even adults of 
different ages.

<p>

The pattern by which each of us goes through these 
stages is an individual and interrelated and interdependent, 
basically a very complex process.  But for most of us, we 
acquire these skills, especially socialization, in a fairly 
sequential manner, and we move from one stage to the next if 
we are able to complete the tasks that are required from the 
previous stage.  If we don't complete those tasks or there 
are certain skills that are absent, it makes learning new 
behaviors or more mature behaviors a little bit harder.

<p>

Before I discuss the issue of homosexuality and 
sex education, let me give you an example of another, 
actually, a less controversial topic in sex education that 
is not consistent, let's say, with the cognitive development 
or the learning needs of preteens and teens, and that is the 
notion of including a decision-making model.

<p>

Many sex education curricula teach decision-making 
to children -- again, this 10- to 18-year-old age -- so that 
they make appropriate decisions regarding their sexual 
behavior.  They learn a model that helps them to identify a 
problem, develop a set of options to solve that problem, 
assess those options, and then eventually make a decision or 
pick one of the options that they consider to be the best.

<p>

Now, my first reaction when I looked at these 
programs -- and, I am sure, any parent's first reaction -- 
is, well, this sounds like a good thing.  You know, getting 
children to make responsible choices sounds like a great 
thing.

<p>

But when you balance that against the actual 
characteristics of these same children, you find that many 
of them are not able to think ahead, they are not able to 
assess risk, and they don't really fully consider the 
feelings of others.  Instead, as is characteristic of most 
preteens and teenagers, they are self-centered, they are 
idealistic, they are very present-oriented and impulsive.  
And the result is that these children may be able to 
memorize a decision-making model, but they are not likely to 
use it.

<p>

But the problem runs a little bit deeper than just 
using or not using this particular model.  It is a problem 
of adults expecting preteens and teenagers to act like 
adults when they should be acting like teenagers.  And as 
much as none of us like a lot of the behavior of teens, they 
are actually supposed to be self-centered, they are supposed 
to be idealistic, and they are supposed to be very grounded 
in the present.  And these characteristics actually provide 
a kind of protection for them in the process of 
experimenting with new ideas and new behaviors.

<p>

The role of parents and adults or teachers, then, 
is to provide a structure that allows teens to do this 
experimentation, to experiment, but making it consistent 
with their capabilities, but also be available to help them 
learn from this experience.

<p>

What is taught in sex education really asks the 
child or the preteenager or teenager to skip an important 
stage of development, to make critical decisions without the 
skills and guidance that are needed.  This expectation can 
and does lure many preteens and teens into high-risk 
situations that are really beyond their current 
capabilities.  Some of those risks can include pregnancy and 
now even AIDS.

<p>

Now let's turn to the topic to the homosexuality, 
which is usually addressed in a very similar manner, just 
presented, put forth out there to the same age group of 
children.  The homosexuality and, to a lesser degree now, 
same-sex relationships are actually commonly found in sex 
education curricula as a result of this growing debate about 
homosexuality.

<p>

But as that is being taught, these preteens and 
teens are entering a phase in their psychosocial development 
where it is very characteristic for these young girls to 
have a very close girlfriend or these boys to have a very 
close boyfriend.  And that is very normal.  That again is a 
stage.  That is an important developmental stage, which I 
will explain in a minute is a building block in terms of 
learning emotional intimacy and closeness.  But in these 
curriculums there is absolutely no distinction made between 
these two, I will say, events -- homosexuality and this 
normal stage of development.

<p>

All of us as children learn emotional intimacy and 
closeness starting in the family, and as we bond with 
mothers and fathers and siblings, et cetera, but as we reach 
puberty, we go outside the family and we develop these 
bonds, first with friends of our own sex; then we sort of 
move into sort of group situations with the same sex and 
then the opposite sex; and eventually, we develop a healthy 
level of intimacy that becomes an important element in 
developing romantic relationships and sexual relationships 
in marriage.

<p>

Now, if they skip a stage or experience a crisis 
in a stage, the negative aspects of that stage will 
predominate, making it difficult for them to handle the 
tasks of the next stage.

<p>

So now, what happens to preteens and teens who 
receive information about homosexuality and same-sex 
marriages at the same time they are going through this 
normal bonding with friends of the same sex, say around the 
ages of 11 to 14?  Well, what generally happens is probably 
not much harm for children who have a large support system, 
a good family and friends, and are kind of on track 
developmentally.

<p>

But for those children who are experiencing, who 
don't have a good family support, have not done well 
developmentally, either emotionally, cognitively, or 
whatever, they are more likely to be confused or seek out 
help to resolve the confusion between these two events.  
Now, that confusion can turn into fear, and that may be a 
fear that I am, indeed, a homosexual, when they are not.

<p>

Unfortunately, I have found as a social worker 
that there are very many well-meaning but misguided 
counselors out there who would actually try to engage this 
child as young as maybe 11 or 12 years old in considering 
whether they are indeed homosexual or not, engage them in 
that kind of conversation, when they are not experiencing 
any kind of sexual maturity whatsoever.

<p>

So as this debate continues about homosexuality 
and same-sex marriages and it gains more legitimacy, I 
foresee that these topics again will just gain greater 
visibility in sex education; and if it is not presented in 
the best interest of the child but rather in the best 
interest of the homosexual rights movement, there is 
potential for great harm to these children.

<p>

MR. HEATH:  -- and the Christian Civic League of 
Maine is not proud to stand here in support of the Defense 
of Marriage Act because we wish that it were not necessary. 
But it is.  It is necessary because our Nation and our 
State, the State of Maine, is considering a radical cultural 
redefinition of marriage, and it is the obligation of all 
Christians in this Nation and in our State of Maine to stand 
publicly and to say, "This is not healthy, this is not a 
good, this is not an appropriate course upon which to 
embark."

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are presenting 
the recent Defense of Marriage Briefing.

<p>

Peter LaBarbera, executive director of Accuracy in 
Academia, talks about how the homosexual activist community 
has impacted the way schools teach our children, and he 
looks at how a pro-homosexual viewpoint is advanced.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Briefing, Capitol Hill, 
July 2, 1996, continues:]

<p>

MR. LaBARBERA:  With all the discussion about gay 
marriage in the headlines, what is really an interesting 
thing that has been transpiring across the country is the 
rush to push pro-gay measures in the schools.  It is moving 
so far and fast that I really don't think the average parent 
with children in the schools is aware of what is going on.

<p>

Ironically, just as we are meeting here right now, 
the National Education Association is meeting across town, 
and one of the things they will be debating is reversing 
Resolution B-9, which called for the celebration of Gay and 
Lesbian History Month.  Inside word from the NEA is that 
they will repudiate B-9 because it created such a stir 
across the country when parents found out that the Education 
Association was calling for this, but it will be replaced by 
another resolution which calls for increased tolerance and 
respect for gays and lesbians.  And so we are kind of seeing 
a watered-down version of the same thing, which is the 
imposition of one moral view on homosexuality in the name of 
tolerance.

<p>

I think that what people don't realize is that the 
guy activists have a big advantage over the pro-family 
movement when it comes to education and other issues.  They 
are promoting one single, radical goal, which is the 
promotion of homosexuality, while parents and others and 
just generally even conservatives are fighting a 
multiplicity of goals, and I think studies have shown that 
when you are pushing one thing, you are concentrating 
heavily on one thing, almost like a religion, it is easier 
to push that through.  And that is what we are seeing.

<p>

There is an organization that I just learned about 
a few months ago called GLISTN.  That is the acronym.  It is 
the Gay and Lesbian and Straight Teachers Network, which 
already has, by its own claims, over 3,000 members.  The 
entire purpose of GLISTN is to campaign against homophobia 
in schools and defend openly homosexual teachers in the 
classroom.

<p>

So I think it is something that is going on.  It 
is happening rapidly, and there are a lot of suppositions 
that are being made that our parents are not aware of, and 
that is the supposition that there is such a thing as a gay 
kid, gay youth.  There's a certain percentage out there of 
kids who are gay, and now they are actually using the terms, 
also, "lesbian," "bisexual," and "transgendered."  They are 
talking about gay and lesbian and transgendered youth as if 
this is a natural identity to these kids, and they are just 
assuming it to be true.

<p>

There has been no societal debate on this.  I 
don't think there has probably been much of a debate in 
educational circles about gay identity.  And yet, all over 
the country, kids are being confirmed in homosexuality.  The 
gay activists and their allies are assuming the existence of 
gay identity, and then they are saying, "Look, we have to go 
out and we have to find these kids and we have to support 
them in the midst of this homophobic society."  You actually 
see more and more focus on eradicating homophobia at even 
the K-6 level, and there is even a call, I think by a gay 
activist group called GLAD, there has been a call to use 
children's television, PBS, to eradicate homophobia.

<p>

And so we are seeing it go earlier and earlier, 
and it is all based on this supposition of born gay.  If 
they are born gay and it's fixed, you can't change it.  
Well, then, get out there and find them and support them in 
this homophobic society.

<p>

I think that what we have to realize is that so 
much of the homosexual activist agenda is based on this 
victim concept, in this whole huge field now of promoting a 
pro-gay, a gay-affirming message in the schools.  We have 
the Gay History Month which is being debated by the NEA.  
Frequently you will have somebody like Eleanor Roosevelt, 
where there are claims on one side that she was a lesbian, 
but the students are given her name, Eleanor Roosevelt, 
without any corresponding getting the information on the 
other side.  There is a debate over this.  There are two 
sides to this debate.  And so they are told somebody like 
Eleanor Roosevelt was a homosexual; they are just told that 
as a fact. 

<p>

In the more extreme cases, they are told that 
people like St. Paul and Florence Nightingale were 
homosexual as well, as this is stated as fact.  And so this 
is highly politicized history that the students are getting.

<p>

Another strategy -- this is really promoted 
heavily by GLISTN -- is the creation of gay-straight youth 
alliances in high school.  These frequently become the 
conduits of pro-homosexual politicking and propagandizing 
within the schools.

<p>

In Massachusetts, these gay-straight alliances are 
actually getting state funding.  An incredible development 
has happened in Massachusetts.  Although there is a 
Republican governor, Governor William Weld, he is also the 
most pro-gay governor in the Nation.  He has instituted 
something called the Commission on Gay Youth, which is 
promoting this victimization strategy to the point where 
they are funding these gay-straight alliances in the 
schools.

<p>

In one instance, in Dedham High School in 
Massachusetts, a gay-straight alliance got $2,000 and they 
ended up creating -- without parents knowing anything about 
it, they created a questionnaire which was passed out to all 
students in their home rooms.  One of the questions on the 
questionnaire was, "Do you feel lesbian or gay people should 
be allowed to marry?"  So we are seeing the politicization 
through the students, and of course, students like to rebel 
and they like to do things that their parents don't like, so 
it is a natural for even the talented students to go along 
with these gay-straight alliances.

<p>

Another thing that they are doing is they are 
affirming the right of openly homosexual teachers to proudly 
affirm their identity in class.  The National Educational 
Association again has defended this very much, and we will 
see more and more of this, the right of teachers to be 
openly homosexual in the classroom.  There was actually a 
teacher who declared her classroom a safe zone for gay 
students.

<p>

And lastly, again, we see the new effort now -- 
there are whole videos out within the gay activist movement 
to combat homophobia in K-6.  So they are going all the way 
down to the preschool level to start teaching about 
homosexuality.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Press 
Conference, June 24, 1995, continues:]

<p>

MR. BARBEE:  There is just a plethora of economic
impacts that haven't been talked about hardly at all. For
example, within just federal law, within the law and the
regulations, there are over 800 sections that refer to
marriage.  With the word "spouse," there are over 3,100
references to the word "spouse" within federal law.

<p>

Now, within the beltway mentality, that tends to 
be thinking that that is all of it.  It's not all of it.
There are 50 other states that also have laws and
regulations and local governments that have ordinances that 
state and have to do with the rights that proceed from the 
definition of marriage and family and the word "spouse."

<p>

These would all be set in disarray.  Can you 
imagine the number of court cases, lawsuits, that would 
arise out of this, and the impact on businesses all across 
this country?

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We will now hear from Mary 
Beth Style, a social worker who is a former vice president 
of the National Council for Adoption.  Mary Beth's 
experience with the world of adoption is crucial to 
understanding why pairs of women or men do not trump a 
married mom and dad.

<p>

[Segment from July 2, 1996, Defense of Marriage 
Capitol Hill Briefing continues:]

<p>

MS. STYLE:  Whenever I talk about adoption, I like 
to start with reminding people what adoption is all about.  
Adoption is all about children.  It is all about the best 
interests of children and meeting the needs of children, 
creating families for children, replicating the biological 
families that children would have when their own biological 
families cannot or will not raise them.

<p>

As such, we make sure at this point that children 
have a mother and a father, which is why we terminate the 
biological parents' rights.  It is not foster care, it is 
not guardianship where biological parents retain rights and 
a child may have two mothers or two fathers.  It is adoption 
in which you have one set of parents.

<p>

One of the things that we do see is that in the 
states were adoption law occurs, there is a lot of variation 
when you are looking at time frames of when you can sign 
consents, when you can revoke consents, when you can 
overturn an adoption and things like that.  But the one 
thing that everybody is unanimous about is that an adoption 
cannot occur unless it is proven to be in the best interest 
of the child.

<p>

So one of the things that has concerned me about 
people who are trying to reform adoption laws, as they say, 
whether we are talking about gay rights or any other thing, 
is that we stop talking about children all of a sudden and 
we start talking about the rights of parents or of adults 
and the needs of adults that want to adopt, as if we can 
create a right to adopt.

<p>

There is no right to adopt, and I think we need to 
look at that rights language, because if you have a right to 
adopt, then you have a guarantee to adopt, and the state 
would have to guarantee you a child. Now, it is absurd.
It is absurd on its face, and I think we need to remember 
that.

<p>

A judge cannot grant an adoption unless it is 
shown to him that it is in the best interest of the child.
Now, there may be some differences of opinion on what is in 
the best interest of a particular child, but it still has to 
go back to that child.  Placement decisions have to be made 
on the child, and I think we need to keep that in mind.

<p>

Currently, the states do not generally say who can 
and cannot adopt, with a few exceptions where they may have 
that people with a history of abuse or are criminals, 
felons, cannot adopt.  And I am not sure I want to put on 
the books who can and cannot adopt.  Now, we do have two 
states, New Hampshire and Florida, which say that 
homosexuals cannot adopt.

<p>

I think we need to leave that open to the 
practice, because I think you need to look at each 
individual case to determine what is in the best interest of 
the child.  In most states currently -- now, we do have some 
case law that is changing this -- is that a married couple 
or a single person can adopt, but two single persons cannot 
adopt the same child.

<p>

The reason for that -- and I think that that is a 
sound policy -- is that the state believes that in order for 
two adults to parent a child, they have to have a legal 
commitment to each other.  You cannot form a family through 
a child.  The family has to be there and the child comes 
into it.

<p>

And so one of the things that we have seen is that 
the Court of Appeals in New York has just granted a 
homosexual couple and an unmarried heterosexual couple the 
right to adopt, which is a first time that that has 
happened.  Well, it is not the first time it has happened, 
but it is an exception to the rule.

<p>

One of the more celebrated cases we had where we 
had two unmarried people adopting was Woody Allen and Mia 
Farrow, and they had gotten a special exemption from a 
particular court, and we have seen the disaster of that.
Now, obviously, not all will end up like that, but it is 
important to recognize that there is a legal family, a 
committed family there, before a child goes into it.

<p>

We also, I think, don't want to allow people who 
are making placement decisions to be arbitrary in their 
decision making, but I think that we need to look at that as 
far as what is in the best interest of the child.  People 
will argue that a policy by an agency which says that an 
individual over 60 cannot adopt is arbitrary and that that 
should not happen.

<p>

But we have to remember that in adoption, we are 
responsible for the child; we are going to stack the deck 
for the child, so that while we cannot guarantee that a 35-
year-old is not going to get hit by a car, the odds are that 
there is more chance for a 35-year-old to still be around 
for that child to reach the age of maturity than for a 60-
year-old adopting that child.  And so there are some 
policies that can be discriminating in selecting individual 
families that we need to keep in place because, again, there 
is no right to adopt but there is a right for a child to 
have the best opportunity to a family.

<p>

Now, I think as far as the issue of gays and 
lesbians that we have plenty of evidence that children do 
better in a two-parent family which is a mother and a 
father.  There has been a lot of emphasis in the last year 
or so on what happens to kids without fathers.  We haven't 
paid as much attention about what happens to kids without 
mothers, but I think that all of us can understand what that 
would be.

<p>

And it is not a matter of quantity.  It is not a 
matter of two parents, because children that are raised by a 
grandmother and a mother are not doing as well as the kids 
who have a mother and a father.  Kids needs mothers and 
fathers, and I think that as we develop adoption policies, 
we have to keep children in mind rather than being concerned 
about the needs and wants of adults.  Kids don't care about 
being politically correct; they just want a mommy and a 
daddy.

<p>

[Segment from June, 24, 1995, Press Conference continues:]

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  It has been mentioned here today that 
one of the things that we are most concerned with is our 
children.  Everyone always is concerned about the next 
generation that is coming along; what are we going to teach 
our children?  And quite frankly, as this legislation moved 
through North Carolina and we heard from, in both houses in 
the committee meetings, a number of homosexual activists, 
particularly from several lesbians who talked about raising 
children in their families and how some of their children 
were becoming homosexuals and some of their children, a few 
of them, were not, it really did a lot to let legislators 
understand that this is a critical issue; that in fact who 
raises these children is an important part of where we going 
to be down the road.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

We now bring you some intriguing questions from 
those who attended the recent Defense of Marriage Briefing, 
and the answers, not often heard beyond a quick sound bite, 
from the experts who spoke.

<p>

[Segment from July 2, 1996, Defense of Marriage Briefing continues:]

<p>

QUESTION: Dr. Satinover, when you were talking
about the evidence that is there stating what you had (said)
in your opening statement, what do you see as the primary
barrier for getting that evidence to mainstream America?
You mentioned the media.  Is it more than just the media?
And if it is the media, what does it have to gain by
precluding that evidence?

<p>

DR. SATINOVER: I think probably the major reason 
that that evidence doesn't get out there is because of the 
tremendous reservoir of sympathy and good will that most 
Americans harbor for people who are in any kind of trouble 
and who are put upon.

<p>

The truth of the matter is that homosexuality 
afflicts a very small minority of the population.
Obviously, that figure itself has been the subject of some 
dispute.  Probably 3 percent is a good scientific, 
replicable percentage.  And there is no question that 
homosexuals suffer tremendous emotional distress both in 
their early personal lives and also in the way that they are 
frequently treated by others.

<p>

When they began to organize as a group and made a 
plea for sympathy, I think most people felt that, yes, that 
is right, we owe it to them.  And it became very, very
difficult, as the whole picture began to change and
determined efforts were made to paint a portrait of the
scientific evidence that was different than the truth, it
really became very difficult for people to be motivated to
take the time and trouble and argue against it. The
majority of people really didn't care about it. It didn't
affect them, and so why make trouble?

<p>

And the truth is that you can get into a 
considerable amount of difficulty by crossing gay activism, 
especially within the professions.  They have made an 
attempt within the American Psychiatric Association to make 
it an ethical violation for a psychiatrist to help treat a 
homosexual who wishes to change, even if that is what the 
person himself wants.  So a lot of people have been 
basically intimidated into just walking away from it.

<p>

However, it has gone too far, and in my view, the 
real problem that we need to look at is not so much gay 
activism as it is the very, very large number of people who 
wish to leave homosexuality.  The relationship -- there is a 
strong correlation between broken families and the next 
generation's incidence of homosexuality.  We are witnessing 
now the problems that began in this society 20, 30, 40 years 
ago, and there are a tremendous number of people out there 
who need our help, and it absolutely will do no good 
whatsoever for us to say, "This problem doesn't really touch 
me.  I'm just going to deal with it on a political level.
Let 'them' have what they want."  Because that will teach 
the younger rising generation precisely the wrong lesson.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Gay political activists say that 
they are really for exclusions in discrimination concerning 
the churches in America, the temples and churches in 
America.  But if gay marriage is accepted into the civil 
government in America, what would stop the gay political 
activists from coming up now to the church level and saying, 
"Hey, you know, it's accepted in the civil government, and 
unless you accept active homosexuals into the churches, then 
we are going to withdraw your 501(c)(3) status, your tax-exempt 
status"?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, I think that is a very real 
threat.  A lot of the gay activists have said, "Look, we'll 
allow ministers to perform the usual type of wedding and to 
bar homosexual weddings."  I think what they are leaving out 
is, "for now."  Because once you are outside the civil law, 
once the churches' rules are said to be immoral, because the 
law says they are wrong, this situation cannot hold for very 
long.  We have seen other situations in which religious 
exemptions once granted were taken away once the government 
felt there was a compelling interest to do so.

<p>

I can foresee a time when there will be -- if all 
these gay rights laws are in place, and some churches 
perform same-sex weddings -- that the ones that do not will 
be seen as suspect, as churches themselves, and we may find 
ourselves in the situation that the people of the Soviet 
Union were in where these churches might be allowed to 
perform their own ceremonies and have services behind closed 
doors but have no public life at all.  They will be 
outcasts.

<p>

So when you put gay rights into the law, you are 
slowly and surely ghettoizing the churches and saying that 
you're no longer part of the civil code here.  That's very 
dangerous.

<p>

QUESTION: I think it was you that mentioned that 
most gay activists don't really intend to harm the family.
Mr. Knight, you were using words like "tyranny" and "aiming
to achieve raw power."  Is there any way to assess if there 
is an aim or a goal of this body?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  We may disagree.  I think they are 
out to harm the family based on their own statements.
Michelangelo Signorelli(?) is not alone.  Paula 
Edelbrich(?), who is legal director of Lambda Legal Defense 
Fund, which is bringing many of these cases, is not even a 
fan of marriage because she said it isn't radical enough.
"We want to completely, radically alter the institution of 
the family."  And other activists have said so.

<p>

I am not saying that homosexuals feel that way; I 
am saying homosexual activists are aiming at that. A lot of 
homosexuals are sitting on the sidelines just saying, "Leave 
me alone.  I don't want to get involved in this."  That's 
not who I am talking about.  I am talking about the activist 
movement here.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: I think it is very important to 
point out that most homosexuals are not activists.  I was in 
that myself for nine years, and many of us were not really 
involved.  The homosexual activists seem to be speaking for 
the majority of homosexuals.  Most homosexuals don't even 
want to be associated with the political movement in this 
country.  I don't think it is more than 5 percent of the 
homosexual population in this country that are connected to 
the gay political movement, and I think that needs to be 
addressed.

<p>

[Segment from June 24, 1995, press conference continues:]

<p>

MR. ZANOTTI:  If we liken marriage to a kite in 
the wind, we could observe that over recent generations the 
string that holds it in the sky has been fraying.  Sometimes 
the kite doesn't look that good up there.  Sometimes it is 
not as shiny and as brilliant as we once thought it was, and 
we wonder how far it can eventually travel, if our culture 
does not deal with this issue today, if we do not pass DOMA, 
if we do not hear the cries from across the Nation, of state 
after state after state, if we permit marriage to be 
redefined according to the proponents of same-sex marriage 
who define it accordingly.  It is best understood as a 
relationship of financial interdependence between two people 
who make a public commitment.  If this happens, we will cut 
the string of marriage forever, and our culture will drift 
off with no control.

<p>

Mark the hour.  It's somewhere around 10:17.  Mark 
the day.  This is the 24th of June.  In 16 years in the 
public policy business, we have taken quite a practice to 
studying history.  If you are a student of history, you will 
have noticed the different dialects, the different 
geography, the different approaches, and it will sound a lot 
like debates that have happened before in this Nation, and I 
would caution you to note this day in history, because this 
is the kind of debate that rents the soul of a nation.  It 
rips the soul of a nation; it tears it.  This is the kind of 
debate that gets out of hand.

<p>

"These are the times that try men's souls," has 
been once before stated in our culture.  Mark the hour and 
mark the day, because this sounds like places our Nation has 
been before, places that have cost huge human sacrifices in 
life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are discussing what once
was the foundation of families and cultures: marriage.

<p>

Unfortunately, the institution of marriage battles 
daily for the esteem it once held, and the reasons for this 
erosion range from the breakdown in values to the laws which 
allow individuals to hastily rid themselves of a difficult 
situation.

<p>

Is it possible to have both love and marriage?
We'll be talking to columnist and author Maggie Gallagher, 
whose most recent book, <i>The Abolition of Marriage</i>, takes 
a look at why marriage is collapsing and some ways to rebuild 
cherished lifelong relationships.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Gary Bauer, president 
of the Family Research Council.  Gary takes an analytical 
look at the approaching elections and the strategy political 
parties are employing.  It has already been an interesting 
road to election day.

<p>

So let's hear from Gary to see what he foresees 
for the journey ahead as Straight Talk takes you Behind the 
Headlines.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

You know, there has been a lot of conversation 
lately by media and political analysts about the way in 
which the Republicans are playing their hand versus the way 
the Democratic Party is playing its hand.

<p>

You've got Bill Clinton with the issue of the week 
and Bob Dole saying, you know, "Look, I'm going to bring my 
strategy out later."  You've got the Democrats on the Hill 
bringing forward new legislation even in the ninth hour of 
the legislative session, and the Republicans sort of trying 
to clean up old business and doing a lot of behind-the-scenes, 
quiet negotiating that we're not hearing about.  Do you think 
this is an effective strategy?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I think the Republican Party has 
a problem right now.  I think a lot of folks around the 
country are really hoping that they'll get a little bit more 
aggressive in putting the program out for the American 
people to examine.

<p>

It's kind of ironic, because I think most 
Americans are close or closer to where the Republican Party 
is on these issues, whether it's lowering taxes, smaller 
government, traditional values, or whatever.  The polling 
data is pretty overwhelming.  And so it's sort of ironic 
that the party seems to not be able to find its legs right 
now to be promoting those things.

<p>

I would love to see and hope that Bob Dole, for 
example, will emphasize in the weeks ahead the need for 
massive tax cuts.  The American people want tax cuts.  It 
will get the economy moving strongly, which is what we all 
want.  And yet the issue seems to not exist right now 
because the party hasn't brought it up.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Tax cuts are a great example.  As 
you know, Bill Clinton talked about the middle-class tax 
cut, and one never appeared; and the Republicans, in their 
Contract with America, said, "Look, we're going to go for a 
$500-per-child tax cut," and there's a lot of quiet again 
behind the scenes negotiating.  Maybe it will be on one 
appropriations bill, maybe another.

<p>

And yet Bill Clinton, who has raised taxes, is 
talking a lot about tax cuts; Bob Dole again saying very 
little.  What's the problem here?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Yes, this is really bizarre.  I saw a 
poll the other day that just was unbelievable to me.  It 
asked the question, "Who do you think is most likely to 
lower your taxes?"  And Bob Dole and Bill Clinton were 
basically tied on that question.  Now, this is absurd.  Bill 
Clinton put through one of the most massive tax increases in 
the history of the country right at the beginning of his 
administration.  As you just alluded to, he promised a 
middle-class tax cut which never materialized.

<p>

Senator Dole has advocated tax relief for years.  
And yet to the general public, the two candidates right now 
are indistinguishable.

<p>

I think that kind of a poll ought to be a reminder 
to the Republican National Committee that you cannot assume 
that people out of Washington understand these differences. 
We've got to remind them every day.  And certainly Senator 
Dole and the Republican Party need to remind the American 
people every day that they're the party of lower taxes and 
tax relief.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems like Bill Clinton has taken 
a page out of Newt Gingrich's playbook with his issues of 
the week, and Newt had, of course, the Contract with 
America, talking about this is what I'm running on; Bill 
Clinton bringing forward his own agenda items.  Do you find 
some irony there?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, yes, there is a lot of irony 
there. In fact, Senator Dole, I think, suggested the other 
day that maybe Bill Clinton just ought to get a big sign 
that says "Me, too," and then every time Senator Dole takes 
a position, Clinton could stand up and hold up the sign. I 
think the point that Senator Dole was trying to make is that 
the President has been co-opting many of these issues.

<p>

There's an interesting thing here to notice.  The 
issues that the President is going out on are not really 
federal issues.  In the last couple of weeks, we have had 
the President say he is for school uniforms.  We've had them 
introduce a federal initiative on school truancy.  I mean, 
however much one might be happy that the President is saying 
these things, they have almost nothing to do with 
Washington, D.C.

<p>

Truancy, the problem of school truancy, is a 
problem for local school districts.  The decision of whether 
students will wear uniforms to class or not is a decision 
for local school districts to make.

<p>

But the President is very astute.  By taking a 
stand on these positions, he sends a message to voters that, 
culturally, he is traditional, the way they are.  And he 
avoids needing to do anything about these matters because 
they really aren't Washington or Presidential issues.  

<p>

So he gets the advantage of talking about them 
without really having to take any sort of action.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It would seem as though the 
Republicans are keeping their powder dry for some future 
date.  Would that be your advice to them?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, my good friend George Bush kept 
his powder dry for what appears in retrospect to have been 
an entire campaign, and unfortunately, instead of getting 
reelected, he ended up losing to Bill Clinton.

<p>

I have never understood what happened during that 
campaign.  George Bush was and is a good and decent man.  He 
had a great program he could have run on, and it just never 
seemed to get explained to the American people.  I hope that 
Bob Dole is not going to make the same mistake this year.

<p>

Bill Clinton is an incredible campaigner.  You've 
got to take your hat off to him.  He really makes his case 
and does it well.  I don't think they should wait till the 
convention.  I don't think they should wait till Labor Day, 
which some advisers are [suggesting].  I think the campaign 
is going on now and that Bob Dole needs to outline his 
vision for the future of the country and how to take the 
American people into the next century.

<p>

You have to say the things you are for, the things 
you believe in, and you've got to do it over and over and 
over again.  It's like telling your wife you love her.  You 
can't say it too many times.  It takes that to get through 
all the din and noise that the American people are subjected 
to.

<p>

So I would urge Bob Dole and the Republican Party 
every day to bring up taxes, to bring up the need for 
smaller government, to bring up the need for a strong 
defense, to bring up traditional values, family issues, and 
to do that right through the campaign, through the summer, 
through the conventions, through the campaign, and begin to 
explain to the American people the differences between that 
party and the party that Bill Clinton heads up, which tends 
to believe in higher taxes, big government, more regulation, 
and so forth.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One of Clinton's advisors said that 
the way that you know what America really understands and 
talks about in terms of a campaign is by watching the late 
shows; Jay Leno and David Letterman are an indicator of what 
people understand about politics.  And we've heard a lot 
lately about seances and Hillary Clinton talking with 
Eleanor Roosevelt, and it has been quite a big joke.  And 
yet the Clinton White House struck back very quickly, 
saying, "Look, other people have done it.  Nancy Reagan has 
done it.  Jackie Kennedy talked with Lincoln," something 
that I don't think most people had ever heard before.  Do 
you think that that is an effective way of dealing with it?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know the old saying, the 
best defense is a strong offense.  The Clinton team really 
nailed this down four years ago, again in the Bush campaign.  
They formed a quick-response team whose job it was to 
literally respond within hours of any Republican attack, and 
they did that consistently through the campaign.  If George 
Bush made a point in the morning, by the time the evening 
news played that night, there was a response from James 
Carville and Stephanopoulos and the other wordsmiths around 
the President.

<p>

They are doing the same thing now, and it is very 
effective.  Again, I think my Republican friends could take 
a page out of this handbook and realize that no charge 
against Bob Dole ought to be allowed to linger for days 
without somebody in the party responding to it.  We are 
living in a media age where the attention span is very 
short.  Stories come and go literally within a matter of 
hours, and I think it is very important for the Republicans 
to be just as quick on the response as the Clinton White 
House is.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Lately there has been some analysis 
by conservative media critics talking about the incredible 
barrier that a Republican has to overcome in terms of 
getting any kind of positive echo from the media, while a 
Democratic candidate or official really does have a 
resonance with the media on a lot of issues.

<p>

David Fromme(?) from <i>The Weekly Standard</i> said 
lately, "Well, sure, the President gets some negative press. 
But wouldn't anybody if they were accused of womanizing and 
skirt-chasing and bad loan deals and campaign finance 
problems?  I mean, how much do you have to go through before 
you get a couple of bad press stories?"

<p>

But do you think that these character issues are 
going to have a negative effect?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, first, let me address the 
question about the media.  This city is still talking about 
a study that was done earlier in the summer that showed that 
only 4 percent of Washington-based reporters said that they 
were registered Republicans.  Now, are we really to believe 
that that has no impact on the way the news is reported?  It 
has to have an impact.  People are normal human beings.  
Their biases, their prejudices inevitably are going to seep 
into the coverage.  So Republicans and conservatives do have 
a higher bar to jump, and it is something that they are 
going to have to deal with for years into the future.

<p>

The character issue is a troubling one because, as 
you indicated, there are certainly a lot of character 
problems evident in the Clinton Administration.  I was 
talking to Senator Nickles the other day after he had just 
come off the floor of the Senate, where he was attempting to 
summarize in a half-hour, in a floor speech in the Senate, 
those character issues, and he said, "Gary, the half-hour 
was over and I hadn't gotten through half of them."  And he 
could not think of any recent administration, certainly any 
administration in the 20th century, that had this many 
character issues or values-related issues to deal with.

<p>

Will it make a difference on election day?  I 
don't know.  I certainly think character issues and value 
issues can weaken the standing of the President.  But I 
think, at the end of the day, probably, unfortunately, 
Americans go into the voting booth and vote on who they 
think has a vision for the future.  I think they are 
troubled by scandal, they are troubled by somebody that 
might have engaged in inappropriate activities.  But at the 
end of the day, they want to know which candidate is going 
to build an America that is going to be better for them, 
their jobs, their children, their families.

<p>

And so while I would encourage the Republicans to 
keep talking about character, I don't think, when the 
election is over, that that will be a substitute for putting 
forth a coherent vision of how you want to govern the 
country and what you hope for the American people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Democratic Party -- and Bill 
Clinton in particular -- has very much pursued alternative 
media strategies.  They have gone to MTV, they have done the 
late shows, they have looked at where the counterculture is. 
The Republicans, on the whole, have stayed with a more 
traditional approach, doing network television advertising, 
sticking with the weekend news analysis shows, much more 
standard in their approach.

<p>

Do you think that the Republicans would benefit 
from pursuing an alternative media strategy?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I think they need to be aware 
that there are obviously a lot more choices now for the 
American people than there used to be in the media, and 
you've got to get beyond just the three major networks.  But 
I wouldn't advise them to do what Clinton did in the early 
years of his Presidency and during the 1992 campaign, where 
he went on MTV and answered questions about what kind of 
underwear he wore and went on stage with Al Gore as the 
blues brothers, and so forth.

<p>

You will notice that in the last couple of years 
you don't see that anymore, that in fact the President tries 
to act Presidential, which is a good thing for a President 
to do.

<p>

I would not try to kowtow to the cultural values 
of MTV.  I would use MTV for regular ads to present the 
Republican message and the conservative message.  But I 
don't think you've got to do the sorts of things that Bill 
Clinton did that I thought were, quite frankly, rather 
embarrassing for a President of the United States.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: At the end of the day, Gary, what do 
you think will determine who our next President will be?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know, this is really a very 
basic issue.  Every public opinion poll shows that America 
is basically a conservative country.  We just saw a study in 
the last couple of weeks where literally 20 issues were 
outlined, and I believe on 17 of the 20 the American people 
came down on the conservative side.

<p>

That being the case, the most conservative 
candidate ought to win the election, and there is absolutely 
no doubt to anyone in this city that Bob Dole is the 
conservative candidate and that Bill Clinton is the liberal 
candidate.  Around the country, however, the public, the 
voter, seems confused about that.

<p>

So I think the election will rise and fall on who 
is able to make the articulate case for conservative values. 
That ought to be Bob Dole, and I hope that he will meet that 
challenge and outline that vision.  If he doesn't do that, 
then I think the American people, out of confusion, may in 
fact reelect the President.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you, Gary, so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
introduce you to a nationally known author, Maggie 
Gallagher, who discusses her book, <i>The Abolition of 
Marriage</i>, and provides key insight into what has caused the 
marriage foundation to crumble.  Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segment from the Heritage Foundation's "The Collape of 
Marriage" Panel Discussion held May 15, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. ADAM MEYERSON: The collapse of marriage is 
the number one cause of poverty in this country.  It's the 
number one cause of crime.  It's a major cause of suicide.  
It's a major cause of our educational breakdown.  The 
collapse of marriage also threatens the very future of 
democracy.

<p>

Our republic is based on the self-evident truth 
that all men and women are endowed by our Creator with the 
right to pursue happiness.  Do we have that right if our 
most important institution for providing happiness is 
crumbling before our eyes?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER:  I really don't believe that we are 
going to be a society characterized by faith, hope, 
optimism, and upward mobility if we live in a society in 
which marriage, as it is rapidly becoming, ceases to be the 
normal way in which we raise children.

<p>

The giving of yourself in a lifelong commitment to 
another human being is the most extraordinary thing most of 
us will ever do.  With the abolition of marriage, that last 
possibility for heroism is being taken from us.

<p>

[End of segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We saw a bit of Maggie's insight 
regarding marriage and the struggles men and women face 
today.  But now let's meet the woman of the hour, Maggie 
Gallagher, a syndicated columnist whose most recent book, 
<i>The Abolition of Marriage</i>, has received acclaim in 
publications across the country.

<p>

Maggie, thanks so much for being with us today.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And I want to hold this up, <i>The 
Abolition of Marriage</i>. We are going to be certainly talking 
about it throughout the hour.

<p>

I think what is interesting to me about it is the 
subtext, "How We Destroy Lasting Love," because I think the 
idea is that Cinderella, throughout all the great women of 
mythological American history, that somehow you find your 
love and you have your love, and then they lived happily 
ever after.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Well, and it is also about, too 
often, the divorce culture that we live in is portrayed as a 
great good, you know, that we are freer, we are better off, 
we are happier.  And I don't really think so.  I don't think 
that the kind of culture that we are building, that a 
society where your spouse is no longer trustworthy, that we 
can't really count on those marriage bonds for something so 
basic as helping us raise our children, I don't think that 
women, in particular, are freer or better off, and I think 
that we are losing something very precious.  It's a false 
gain.  We're not really more free, but what we are is much 
more anxious, and we have much less faith in the possibility 
of lasting love, and that is what I really wanted to get 
into with this book.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that the culture of 
divorce itself is a self-fulfilling prophecy?  Divorces 
happen, divorce is easy, divorce could happen to me; 
therefore, maybe my marriage isn't good?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER:  Yes, I do.  I think we're on a 
downward spiral.  I don't think that, by itself, the 
situation will turn around.  You see this in kind of social 
science research that shows that children of divorce are 
both more likely to divorce, themselves, and more likely to 
become unwed parents.  And it is very obvious when you talk 
to these kids why that is true.

<p>

A society which tells people, and tells women in 
particular, that they have a right to be a single parent 
through divorce is going to have a hard time telling the 
next generation that it's important to be married before you 
have children or that a father is a very important part of 
the family, if they didn't have a father as part of their 
family.

<p>

And what everyone experiences, whether they have 
ever divorced or their parents ever divorced or not, is a 
much higher level of anxiety and fear of betrayal.  You 
know, if you do trust your spouse, there's a part of you 
that always ends up wondering, Am I being a fool?  And there 
a lot of people out there telling you that you are a fool if 
you depend on your husband or your wife in any way, because 
the message we're getting is you can't count on anyone, and 
that's not a recipe for a healthy society or a happy person.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think that is a really interesting 
point, being married now almost four years myself.  When my 
husband and I first got married, you would think that people 
would be congratulating you and be very excited about your 
marriage.  And yet I would have to say that the most 
consistent message is, "Now you're going to have problems.  
You think you're happy now.  Give yourself six months, give 
yourself a year."  And since we have made it four years, and 
I would have to say that it has been better every year, I 
guess I don't know when the magic now comes.

<p>

But I was very fascinated by that, about the 
negative way in which everyone encourages you to get married 
and then, on the brink of engagement and married life, tells 
you, "Ah, you're going to have real problems."

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: I think probably even more common 
on the part of the watchers, anyway, if not the 
participants, instead of any person's marriage being a kind 
of reaffirmation, this one moment where we watch something 
extraordinary happen -- two people become one -- there is 
this kind of subtext which is always, well, is this going to 
last?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER:  You know, here we are; we're going 
to give the gifts; we're going to rearrange all our 
relationships.  But is it all going to fall apart or not?

<p>

I do think what you say about happiness, 
everything we know is that marriage is very important for 
people's happiness; that people who don't marry or who are 
divorced as a group are not, by their own accounts, very 
happy people.  They have many more problems, health 
problems, both serious and those that are related to stress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER:  You know, having a person in your 
life that you can count on, that kind of commitment, which 
is the marriage bond, is very important, and we are made to 
be -- not all of us will marry, but we were really clearly, 
the two sexes were made for each other and made for the kind 
of relationship that marriage contains.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  One thing I wanted to ask you, in 
particular, was certainly almost every culture has come from 
a setting in which marriages were arranged, in which 
marriage was not, per se, a romantic adventure, but it had 
the potential to become that, and many people -- actually, 
as a matter of fact, I had an interesting conversation with 
a cabbie on a very long ride not too long ago, telling me 
about how much he loves his wife, whom he met on the day of 
his wedding, and they are from Pakistan.

<p>

What I wanted to ask you was, if you look at that 
historical perspective in which so many marriages have not 
arisen out of romantic candlelight dinners and have a much 
more lasting quality than marriages in America today, why do 
you think, even from our own history -- are these women 
afraid to divorce, or is there something really different 
about marriages in some other cultural contexts?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: I think there is a difference.  I 
want to say, first of all, that we should not underestimate 
how unique the Christian/Western tradition is, and in fact, 
the idea of the consent of the bride, the idea of connecting 
love and marriage, is actually quite old in our own culture, 
and certainly for as long as America has existed, people 
have been making what they saw as love matches, even though 
they may not have placed as much attention to some of the 
romantic frou-frou in those days.

<p>

But I do think there is something important to be 
learned from that.  We tend to think that as marriage 
collapses and we get this high divorce rate that the answer 
is just -- some people say, Make marriage harder, and the 
idea is, just look really, really carefully for the exact 
right person.  And the fact that arranged marriages work so 
well is a hint to me that how you love after you are married 
is probably more important to the success of your marriage 
than finding someone whose personality exactly fits yours, 
because the reality is, even if you found that perfect match 
at the moment that you married, life changes and people 
change, and if your marriage is going to last, it has to 
come from some kind of commitment to that whole person.

<p>

And the other thing about that is that our 
mentality is very consumerist.  It is like, who is exactly 
the right person for me?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: And for marriage to work, both 
people have to be at least equally and hopefully more 
concerned with how can I be the right person for my spouse; 
how do I love this person well?

<p>

I think that that kind of image of marriage, 
recognition that it is not really about our own internal 
feelings, it is about a real other person that we are 
willing to commit to, to care for and take care of in the 
ways that husbands and wives do, is part of what we need to 
recapture more fully.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think Hollywood certainly 
contributes to that flavor-of-the-month mentality about 
marriage:  Well, I am sure another good wife is coming along 
any moment.

<p>

But I want to talk more about how we love after 
marriage when we come back.  And when we come back, we will 
hear more from Maggie and the reasons why marriage seems to 
be crumbling.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are continuing 
our discussion about marriage and, most importantly, what 
makes a successful marriage, with Maggie Gallagher, author 
of Enemies of Eros(?), and her most recent book, <i>The 
Abolition of Marriage</i>. Welcome back, Maggie.

<p>

We were talking before the break about how people 
do love after marriage, and it seems so many books talk 
about, especially, you know, even bag(?) books for a second, 
because people aren't always as good readers as we wish, but 
you've got Cosmopolitan and El Magazine and everybody 
telling you, if you have sex in this way or you have this 
kind of food or whatever, that you're going to catch the 
right man, but not a lot of conversation about what do you 
do once you have this man.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: I am also struck particularly in 
the messages that have been sent to women and what I call 
women's culture, and you are talking about things from Oprah 
and the whole set of daytime shows to People magazine and 
the women's magazines, and for many years they have been 
very, perhaps unconsciously, anti-marriage.

<p>

You look at how many -- go to your supermarket 
sometime and just think about how many covers of People 
magazine in the last -- that you have seen have been about, 
I'm 40, I dumped the geek, I'm free, I'm happy, right?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: And the message that you're 
sending women there is that if you haven't dumped the geek 
and you're still staying in a struggling marriage, there 
must be something wrong with you.  Obviously, the first 
thing you need to do to be happy is to get rid of your 
husband.

<p>

I think that there has a little bit of a turn more 
towards marriage as we see how difficult divorced life can 
be for women, particularly women with children, and for men, 
too, for that matter.  But still there has been directed 
particularly at women, I think, a lot of very hostile 
messages.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You know, what is funny about that 
is at Family Research Council I certainly field hundreds of 
media calls sometimes even in a day, and one of the things 
that has come up as there has been sort of a reemergence of 
marriage is, don't I think that the culture of AIDS has 
really encouraged the reemergence of marriage?  Everyone is 
afraid to get a deadly disease, so they're going to make it 
work.

<p>

But, you know, I don't agree, and I am interested 
in your reaction to this.  I think marriage has reemerged 
because so many people recognize that divorce is not the 
easy answer that it has been made to be, that you can be 
very unhappy and realize that that husband or wife wasn't so 
bad.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: You know, I think that AIDS gave 
some well-educated women who perhaps weren't religious an 
acceptable reason to say no, which they were dying for, but 
it isn't the prime impetus.  It is partly the ongoing 
research literature, which now shows very clearly that 
divorce is very harmful for children, on average; that you 
have two to three times the risk of a whole host of things, 
from psychological disorders, education failures, risk of 
becoming a criminal; and that when you follow these kids to 
adult life, they are, on average, less happy.  They are less 
successful and they are less happy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And they are very much more 
stressed.  There is a lot of uneasiness.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Yes, and we have come to this 
theory that you have just a short crisis and then kids 
adjust and it doesn't really matter whether they have both 
of their parents cooperating and raising them together in a 
married family or not.  I mean, that was a lot happy talk 
which has nothing to do with reality.

<p>

I think that the research confirmation, the expert 
opinion, but really, what you are talking about is people's 
experience.  I mean, we all now have been living in this 
culture for 30 years.  Those happy myths about how divorce 
is better for the kids, et cetera, et cetera, if I am happy, 
my kids will be happy -- we know how hard it is when 
marriage breaks up on both the adults and especially on the 
children, and we are looking for answers.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would like to ask you -- and I 
will throw out some of my own -- what you consider to be 
some of the worst myths about marriage right now.  I think, 
from my perspective with a lot of friends at the beginning 
of their marriages, I think one of the worst myths is that, 
having gotten married, you have finished something, when I 
don't think you have finished anything.  You have begun 
something, and making your marriage is a constant renewal.  
You know, having gotten my job, I am not done.  I am 
actually expected to go and accomplish something.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: There are very few novels that are 
about being married; they are mostly about getting a 
spouse --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, they are.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: -- a husband or a wife, and 
living happily ever after.  Yes, I think there is something 
to that, and it feeds into, again -- the way I think about 
this, Kristi, is marriage basically a creative or productive 
institution or act, or is it a consumption item?  I think it 
is what we produce in life that makes us happy and that it 
is important to recognize that what we're doing when we're 
getting married is building something.  We are making 
something, a relationship with our spouse and a new family 
in most cases; and that in the long run it is our success at 
achieving that, at making that, which is going to make us 
happy, even if we're not happy all the time in the middle of 
that; and that, if we turn around and say, well, "Am I being 
made happy enough to stay married?" what you have done is 
turned your spouse from your principal responsibility, your 
vocation in life, to being just a thing, an object that you 
use up, and if you are not getting what you want, you trade 
them in.

<p>

That is very destructive to love.  It is a habit 
of the heart which is very destructive to both human 
happiness, human virtue, and the ability to love.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: How important is marriage to children? 
You see a lot of conversation today in many contexts, 
whether it be homosexual marriage discussions or 
cohabiting people talking, that if you have one or two or 
three loving people, you know, as long as there is love, 
that children are okay.  But how important is marriage to 
children?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: There have been so experiments in 
the last couple of hundred years, really, with alternate 
family forms, and they all end up dissolving at sort of even 
greater rates than marriage, whatever its imperfections.

<p>

Marriage is key.  It's the way we give children fathers. It's 
the way we teach children that the family is important, that 
family relationships can be counted on. Every person -- and 
I know there are tragic situations where a divorce or a 
separation is necessary -- but every time you divorce as a 
parent, one message you are sending your children is that 
family relationships can appear and disappear, you can be 
related and unrelated, and that in some way, then, love is not 
reliable.

<p>

That message, even if your child doesn't become a 
drug user or depressed or a juvenile delinquent and gets 
good grades and goes to a good college, when you talk to 
children of divorce, that comes out very, very powerfully.  
When they go to love, to marry, to form families, they carry 
with them this enormous burden of fear of betrayal, because 
the lesson their life taught them is that love is not 
reliable, and that is a very hard less to teach a child.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would think that the social 
repercussions of that are going to affect us for many years, 
and I would like to ask you a little bit more about that in 
just a moment.

<p>

Please stay tuned for more words of wisdom 
regarding marriage, divorce, and love from Maggie Gallagher 
when <i>Straight Talk</i> returns.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome once 
again Maggie Gallagher, who is sharing her research and 
insights from her latest book, <i>The Abolition of Marriage</i>. 
Welcome back, Maggie.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We were talking before the break 
about people carrying into marriage, children of divorce, 
even if they have managed to successfully complete school, 
this sense of I don't know what is going to last, what ties 
are real.

<p>

I was wondering if you could sort of look at that 
from a societal benefit. We were talking before. At the 
movie <i>Braveheart</i>, I was watching it and was kind of struck 
by the fact that these men and women were bound by their 
clan, by kinship and these blood lines, and because of that, 
they were going to fight and die together; and how, today, 
we have sort of made kinship optional.  Maybe you're 
related, maybe you're not.  I mean, these ties are very 
breakable.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: And that is the biggest change, 
really, in the post-marital family, is that you don't have 
one family where everyone has the same ties and the same 
loyalties.  It is like you have certain relationships, your 
children have -- and some of your children may have 
different ones, and the only tie that still remains 
reasonably firm is the tie between mother and child.  Even 
for fathers, 10 years after divorce, two-thirds of fathers 
have virtually no regular contact with their children.

<p>

We are raising children, increasingly, in a world 
where all relationships are temporary and disposable, and it 
is very difficult for children to prosper or really for 
anyone to prosper in a world that is that really emotionally 
chaotic.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems to me that that really has 
implications from a national perspective.  There has been a 
lot of talk lately in pro-family circles about a need to 
rebuild a sense of American citizenship or of what does it 
mean to be an American, and yet we are talking there about a 
national consciousness. about a national tie, when what we 
have really communicated through a divorce-prone country is 
that ties are optional.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Yes.  I don't think, as I said, 
that either the conservative ideal of a limited government 
and a strong nation or the more general American dream of 
upward mobility, each generation better off than the last, I 
don't think it is going to happen unless we begin to deal 
with this.

<p>

Kristi, in just 10 years from now, if current 
trends continue, half of our children will be born outside 
of wedlock.  Half of the remainder will lose their fathers 
through divorce.  That means marriage is going to become, 
almost as a lifelong family-forming union, is going to 
become almost a cult practice, a rare minority.  And I don't 
think we as a nation will survive that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Is everyone equally likely to 
divorce?  You know, we see half of all marriages do this, 70 
percent of the population does that, and that is very 
chilling to many.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Yes. No, it isn't. It is not 
spread uniformly, and there are a lot of different variables 
that affect it.  If you and your husband are both married 
for the first time, you will have a significantly lower 
divorce rate than if one of you has been divorced before.  
People who attend church or synagogue or temple regularly -- 
it actually doesn't seem to matter from the standpoint of 
holding marriages together what your religious denomination 
is -- if you're active in it, you have a lower divorce rate.

<p>

In general, educated and relatively affluent 
people have lower divorce rates than the poor, except for 
one very interesting exception.  Marriages in which both 
partners work full time have much more income, but they are 
also much more divorce prone.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why do you think that is?  Because 
you can't pick up the newspaper today without seeing a rise 
in two-income families.  And, frankly, at the Family 
Research Council we have been concerned about that, not 
because women shouldn't work but because a lot of women work 
to offset the tax burden on the American family.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Oh, sure. I think that it 
reflects a lot of disappointment. I mean, when women get 
married and have babies, it's a lot of work, and one of the 
reasons you undertake that work is because you want to spend 
time with your kids, you want a family life, you want to 
build a family life, and if, instead, you are having to 
spend all of your time working, it makes all of the 
frustrations of family life seem a lot worse to you.

<p>

Basically, I think a lot of women aren't getting 
what they wanted, which may be not necessarily working or 
not working but not being the primary breadwinners for their 
family.

<p>

It also, frankly, partly reflects, Kristi, 
sometimes when couples both become very career-oriented, 
there is not a lot of time left for the marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: They are just two people who are 
both more invested in their careers than their family life, 
and people like that are more prone to divorce.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have actually seen a lot of data 
on that in which people say that the give point is the 
marriage.  I mean, you can look at that statistically.  If 
you have home, husband, children, career, outside activities 
-- outside activities do tend to dissipate, depending on 
whether they are connected to your job -- but that, 
ultimately, it is that primary relationship between husband 
and wife, that is the easiest to put aside and say, "Well, 
we'll spend quality time later.  We obviously need to take 
care of our job and kids."

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Right. Well, those are the not 
optional, I guess.  They won't give you the pay check if you 
don't show up, and kids have a way of making themselves 
felt, so people often feel -- and again, I think it is 
worse, either if you are family-oriented and frustrated in 
that desire, you are going to be more frustrated with your 
spouse in your life and feel like you're not getting what 
you're supposed to be.

<p>

And then there is the opposite: if you are not 
family-oriented, if you primarily get your sense of self-worth 
from your job, you are going to be a prime candidate 
for divorce, anyway, and working doesn't cause it; it just 
reflects that orientation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, that is an interesting point 
that you bring up because, I mean, if you read again 
feminist literature or even your average glamour magazine, 
you are certainly going to get the message as a woman that 
your career -- don't let anything interrupt your career.  
That above all things is sacrosanct.  You know, you can put 
your children in day care and you can get another husband, 
but your career is the center.

<p>

And you are saying that the more connected your 
self-worth is to your career, the higher your possibility of 
divorce?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Well, I am not saying this is a 
fact.  I mean, it is a fact that two full-time working 
couples are more likely to divorce -- it does not apply, by 
the way, to part-time working wives -- but I mean, I think 
that if you talk to therapists and to couples who have 
divorced, it is an issue that comes up.

<p>

The question in a marriage is, What is first 
priority?  If the answer is your kids, that can cause some 
problems, but they are both of your kids, so that can be an 
acceptable answer.  If the answer is my job is more 
important than you are, your marriage is in trouble.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So you were talking -- one of the 
things I like about your book is, after it sort of outlines 
a very shaky foundation our society rests on because 
marriage is so stressed by kind of a divorce mentality, you 
are saying, Look, there are some answers.  So how can people 
build a lasting love, or what could society do?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Well, you know, we have to change, 
as I say -- these things did not happen in a vacuum, and we 
have been talking a lot about some of the cultural changes 
and the changes in our ideas of marriage and love and the 
kind of commitment we need to make, and all those are very 
important.

<p>

But something else happened, too, Kristi.  Around 
1970, our government became, for reasons that are difficult 
to fathom, very hostile to marriage as an institution, and 
in a lot of ways, people -- if you go back, there is no one 
saying, "Oh, I want to undermine marriage; I'll do this."  
But a whole series of changes came, passed through our -- 
which have really, I think, been very hostile to marriage.  
They range from, for example, the shift to unilateral no-fault 
divorce.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So the laws became a problem.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Which is responsible for -- maybe 
as much as 25 percent of the increase in divorce rates came 
from that change in the laws, which -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I am going to have to hear more 
about this in two seconds.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Okay.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: After this break, we will bring you 
more interesting revelations regarding marriage and its 
standing in today's society.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are trying to 
understand how our government has had an impact on divorce.

<p>

Maggie, you wrote about this really brilliantly in 
the book, and I certainly want to encourage people to buy 
the book and to read it.  But one of the problems that you 
are uncovering in terms of fixing the divorce problem was 
that some structures had gotten in the way of marriage.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Yes. The government has been very 
hostile.  You know, what unilateral no-fault did is really 
say we're not going to enforce the marriage contract 
anymore.  We're not going to let you get married.  When you 
get married, what are you doing?  Well, you're promising to 
live with someone until you feel like doing someone else.  
Well, guess what, Kristi?  That is rather like cohabitation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is true.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: And one reason why I think 
cohabitation is on the rise is we have reduced marriage from 
a legal standpoint to where it is rather like living 
together with a license.

<p>

But there are a lot of ways government has drained money 
from families that is desperately needed.  Married couples 
are struggling.  They are not having children they want to 
have because they have to pay for subsidies to Amtrak and 
Dole Corporation, and it has been a very low priority, 
protecting family income.  That has had an effect.

<p>

And then we have rewarded in the form of welfare policies 
very destructive behavior, and I am particularly concerned 
with this whole issue of children having children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Then there are other things that people 
don't know about at all, which is, there are federal laws which 
have basically prevented local communities from enforcing 
basic moral standards.  If you, in your school, would like to 
deal with getting pregnant teens out of the classroom and put 
them in a special program and teach them what they need to 
teach and send the message that it is wrong to be 16 and 
having a baby out of wedlock, the reason you cannot do that 
is that the Federal Government has defined that as pregnancy 
discrimination, and you cannot have it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Public housing used to give a 
strong preference to low-income married couple, very 
important support for marriage in the working class, and 
again, that was abolished because the Federal Government 
said that was discrimination on the basis of marital status.

<p>

So there is a lot of work to be done.  There are 
terrible cultural trends.  But a lot of them are, if not 
driven, at least being reinforced by the government, and 
they are frustrating the desire of ordinary Americans to 
have control over their homes, their families, their income, 
and their community life, and that has to change.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have about a minute left, Maggie, 
and I really appreciate your joining us today.  But what one 
or two things can you tell us in this brief amount of time 
about marriage to help people have success in their own 
marriages?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Well, I guess what we really need 
-- people say we need to be less romantic.  But I don't 
believe that, Kristi.  I think we need to be more 
idealistic.  We need to recover a vision of marriage as 
being really heroic and extraordinary and worth making 
sacrifices for.  We need to say to people who are in the 
middle of troubles in their marriages that we think their 
struggles are valuable, that they are doing something 
important, and that we have faith for them when they don't 
have faith themselves that they can work their problems out 
and that the reward for doing so is worth waiting for, and 
that reward -- we are not trying to punish people; we are 
trying to help couples achieve their objective, which is a 
happy family.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is a phenomenal book.  I want to 
hold this up, <i>The Abolition of Marriage</i>.

<p>

Maggie, thank you so much for being with us, and I 
think you are right, you know, and I have to say for myself, 
marriage is the best thing that I have ever done, and I know 
you feel the same way about your family.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we are going to share 
more information regarding issues affecting you and your 
family.  Stay tuned.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are going to discuss so-called 
easy answers to pregnancy, sometimes called the morning 
after pill, emergency contraception, or RU-486.  It all 
sounds like a worry-free procedure when described by the 
activists who are pushing its approval by the Food and Drug 
Administration, but some disturbing facts about the 
complications of those drugs are beginning to come to light.
According to pro-life groups, this two drug abortion method
could lead to severe physical, emotional, psychological, and
legal troubles if it receives FDA approval.  So we will hear
from some experts about the possible complications of this
so-called simple solution.

<p>

But first, a preview of an innovative part of the 
upcoming Republican National Convention.  I spoke with Gus 
Pace, the RNC's Co-Director of Internet Services and FRC's
own Internet expert, Loralei Gilliam, about the
opportunities in Cyberspace for all of those who want to
participate in the convention from their own home. In fact,
FRC president, Gary Bauer, will be available during the 
convention for a cyberchat. Let's here more about this 
exciting opportunity as <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you Behind the 
Headlines.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you so much, Gus and Loralei,
for being with us today on Behind the Headlines. You all 
are involved in a very exciting and revolutionary new way in 
which people can get involved in the Republican Convention.
You know, for the most part people watching conventions were
very passive, watching it on television, reading about it in 
the newspaper, but the Internet has offered some very 
exciting new opportunities.

<p>

Gus, I know you have been working on that.  Can 
you tell us a little bit more about what is going to happen?

<p>

MR. PACE: Well, I think what we are doing with 
the Internet and what the Republican Party is doing with the 
Internet is very exciting right now.  You know, the term 
there that you used, passive, is a very key term.  Always 
before, our participation in political conventions and in 
political activities and in campaigns has been very passive.
We read what is in the newspaper.  We see what is on 
television, and that is it.

<p>

The Internet, I think, has revolutionized that.
It gives us the ability to actually participate -- two-way 
communication.  You know, you can email the platform 
committee this year for the first time.  You can participate 
in live chats with members of Congress and senators and 
governors and elected officials and delegates at the 
convention.  This is a complete new way for the American 
democracy to become involved in the electoral process like 
we have never seen before.

<p>

You know, in 1962, the debates that were televised 
revolutionized the electoral process.  In 1996, I think this 
is sort of the test drive year for the Internet. I think we 
will see a lot of participation on the Internet. It gives 
us the ability to put all of our information, provide all 
the press releases, provide all the speeches, complete on 
the Internet, and you as an active participant or a person 
wanting to participate in the electoral process, can call 
this up from your local computer.

<p>

It does not matter if you are in a small town or 
in a large city or at a public library or at a friend's
house.  You can call up the home page.  You can read the 
speech for yourself.  You are not reading a two-paragraph 
clip that someone else has put together.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: No middle man.

<p>

MR. PACE: No middle man. So I find that very 
exciting.  I mean, I believe that when our message is out 
there and when people see our message complete that we have 
a good message, and it will sell itself.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Loralei, for those people who are 
watching our program and are not familiar with the Internet, 
how would they find this exciting opportunity and the Family 
Research Council connection?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: The best way that I would suggest is 
to participate in FRC's home page.  By accessing our home 
page, we will have what is called a hot link that will link 
our page directly to the convention site.  So that way they 
are able to get FRC's input from the convention, in addition 
to looking at our news releases on what is going on at the 
convention, but at the same time linking to the convention 
site and seeing directly what is going on there.

<p>

The convention site is very innovative in what 
they are able to do with live footage.  You can actually 
click in and see exactly what is going on on the convention 
floor.  From my understanding, this is the first time that 
this has ever happened.  This is going to be real exciting 
for folks to be able to click in and then go into a chat 
room and talk with folks in California, Texas, Missouri, and 
be able to talk about what is going on and see if they are 
in agreement and turn around and use that input and send 
emails to their members or send emails to the platform and 
put their input in on the convention.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gus, I know you have been working 
very long and hard hours developing a lot of things for 
people to enjoy and connect with.  Could you tell us a 
little bit more about what is going to be available?

<p>

MR. PACE: Sure, if I could just follow up a 
little bit with what Loralei said about the Family Research 
Council being a key component, and your home page is a key 
component.  You know, we have designed a very unique 
interactive home page that will exist during the two weeks 
of the convention.  It will be unveiled on the fifth, the 
day the platform discussions take place.  It will be active 
and continue through the entire convention.  The chat rooms 
will all be up and live during the platform.  You will have 
the ability to participate in platform discussions.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And there are going to be some news 
makers participating in that.

<p>

MR. PACE: We will have some news makers scheduled 
during the evening to chat live with you, answer your 
questions.  I will give an example of on Tuesday night the 
state of Missouri has organized a Missouri Night on the 
Internet, and as part of their grass roots organization, the 
local clubs are being encouraged to host their own 
convention parties where they invite their friends in.

<p>

You know, everyone does not have Internet access.
I mean, as I mentioned, this is the test drive year.  So 
they are being asked to invite their friends in or go to a 
library or a public place where there is Internet access, 
and they will have the ability to chat with all the Missouri 
elected officials that are at the convention.  They are all 
going to be on-line for an hour-and-a-half, and this is just 
one example.  There are other states that are doing that, 
also.

<p>

I know that your group, for example, several of 
your members may decide that there is one night that they 
want to have friends over and participate in the convention.
This is something that has never happened before.  To get 
groups together before, you called them around the kitchen 
table, you opened up the newspaper, you read the newspaper, 
and then you discussed what was printed in the newspaper.
This gives you the ability to click on one icon on the home 
page and watch the podium live, like you are on your 
television, or if you do not have that software, you can 
click on another icon and get the printed textual update.  
Then if you want to go into a live chat room and ask some 
questions of your elected officials, you have the ability to 
do that all at one time.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So, Gus, to ask a quick question, 
Gus, are you all working with the Internet site going to be 
monitoring the input and the email to pass along to Haley 
Barbour and the GOP leaders what people are saying?

<p>

MR. PACE: Yes, we will.  We will have a 
continuous content update.  As quick as a speech is given 
from the floor, it will be updated to the home page.  There 
are a couple of really neat things.  Haley will be calling 
in and providing an audio update to the RNC home page about 
once an hour, just sort of a this is what is taking place.  
The week of the platforms, all official platform positions 
will be updated immediately.

<p>

So people will have the access to that 
information.  They can read the complete platform.  They can 
read the complete speech that was given.  They will know who 
is on the platform talking right then.  You are not relying 
on a news anchor or someone else sort of to give you a 
synopsis of what is taking place.  You get the complete 
picture as it is occurring, or you can go back and see what 
was said yesterday.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A wonderful opportunity like this 
that has opened two-way communication is, of course, going 
to open the GOP up in the convention to hearing some 
critical voices and some people who have different kinds of 
opinions.  How are you guys prepared to deal with that kind 
of feedback?

<p>

MR. PACE: Well, you know, our founding fathers 
wrote of a truly informed and participatory democracy.  I 
mean, I think the Internet gives us the ability to do that.  
I am sure there will be some people that will participate 
that will probably express opinions that are a little 
contrary, but our biggest advantage is an informed 
electorate, and I think that once the electorate sees our 
message complete and reads it that they will see we do have 
the best message.  You know, we are not relying on small 
clips of a message.  We have a complete package here.  We 
have a complete party and a complete package.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: I think that is one of the most 
exciting things for our constituents, because so many times 
they feel that they are not able to get all of the 
information, that they are restricted to the media that 
tends to give a liberal bias to the information that is out 
there.

<p>

This way they are able to actually see word-for-word what is 
happening and what is said, and then they can 
make their own informed decision about what was spoken, and 
they are able to participate and get involved, and that was 
part of what was so exciting in 1994 was the grass roots 
actually were able to make a difference, and this is going 
to give them the tools to continue to be involved in 
politics.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: If you are sitting down at the 
computer and you are going to pull up some kind of search 
engine, what kind of words could I type in to get to the 
convention or to FRC's site?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: For FRC's site, it would be www.frc.org.  Easy.

<p>

MR. PACE: And you can go straight from the FRC 
site to the RNC site.  There will be a hot link.  But I 
would encourage everyone to participate.  I mean, we have 
developed what I consider is a phenomenal on-line presence 
this year.  The thing that will make it successful is if 
people come and participate.  Never before have they had the 
opportunity, and we have given them the opportunity this 
year. So I encourage everyone to participate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to be highlighting this 
exciting opportunity on the program and supering it 
throughout, because we want people to make this important 
connection.  Is there anything else you can add so that our 
viewers can really get something different out of this 
special convention?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM:  Well, this allows our constituents 
to get involved, and I think this is very important for them.

<p>

MR. PACE: And I would just say come join us in San Diego.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you so much, both Gus and Loralei, for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will begin our 
discussion about RU-486, the most vogue method of abortion 
today:  how simple is it?

<p>

Please stay tuned to find out.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Videotape of National Right to Life Conference follows.]

<p>

DR. GLASOW: The RU-486 site-detect prostaglandin 
technique is the first first-trimester chemical abortion 
method to seek licensing in the United States and is the 
first chemical abortion method of any kind to be seeking 
licensure in over 20 years.  Dr. David Kessler, the 
Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, President 
Clinton's appointee to that position, has put this RU-486 
abortion method on a record-breaking fast track approval for 
U.S. marketing.  The licensing application was filed a mere 
4 months ago, and Kessler promised that the whole process 
would only take 6 months, which is about one-third of the 17 
months that fast track drugs usually take.

<p>

Based on our concern for both the mother and her 
child, tomorrow we will testify before the only public 
hearing that will be held before the FDA makes its final 
decision on approval.  RU-486 is not a contraceptive or a 
morning after pill and is being licensed only for abortion.

<p>

DR. HARRISON: Proponents of chemical abortion 
claim this is almost a swallow a pill and poof, the 
pregnancy disappears. This is pure medical fantasy.
Chemical abortion requires a four to six step procedure 
taking place over weeks.  The woman has not one but two 
drugs to take on two separate occasions, requiring at least 
three separate pelvic exams until the woman finally passes 
the fetus, and she may pass the fetus any time any place 
over those two weeks.

<p>

DR. FRANZ: RU-486 abortions are marketed as 
providing benefits over surgical abortions because they are 
supposed to be private, patient-controlled experiences that 
are somehow more natural.  These characteristics may 
actually predispose the woman to having greater 
psychological problems.  It is possible for the woman to be 
alone at home when she aborts.  Since it is important that 
she identify the contents of her womb, she must look at the 
results of the abortion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The facts regarding RU-486 are more 
disturbing than many would like the public to believe, so 
tonight we have some special guests to present the rest of 
the story.  I would like to introduce you to Olivia Gans, 
who is head of American Victims of Abortion, a long-time 
Washington activist, and also Gracie Hsu, a policy analyst 
with the Family Research Council, who has worked extensively 
on the RU-486 issue and shares with us some of her findings 
tonight. Thank you both for being with us.

<p>

I would like to start first with Gracie, and I 
know, Olivia, you have been working on this issue at 
National Right to Life for quite a while, but the thing that 
we always hear about chemical abortion is that this will be 
a simpler process.

<p>

We have this surgical procedure in which you go 
and have the baby taken out by a vacuum suction method or a 
new thing, partial birth abortion, some extraction 
techniques at the end of abortion, but is a chemical 
abortion -- first of all, let's take their claims -- simple?

<p>

MS. HSU: No, it is not. As you know, a surgical 
abortion requires maybe a 15 to 30-minute procedure, and it 
is a surgical procedure.  So there is not bleeding 
prolonged.  But when you talk about RU-486, there is 
actually a lot of prolonged bleeding, and this is a 
procedure that takes over the course of 2 weeks to 30 days, 
and you have to go into the doctor's office the first day to 
be administered the drug, two days later to receive a 
prostaglandin, which actually induces labor.

<p>

So you are actually going through the process of 
labor, and because it is a poison -- it is a hormonal change 
in your body -- your body reacts pretty violently, and so 
there is a lot of nausea and vomiting and a lot of bleeding 
involved, and in fact, we know that many women have had to 
seek hospitalization, narcotics for pain killers.  Some have 
even had to undergo transfusions because of the hemorrhaging.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One thing I found startling -- I 
thought I was pretty informed about this -- but when I was 
reading up for the show, that anti-inflammatory drugs like 
Advil or Aleve or some of the typical ibuprofen kind of 
drugs, you know, like a woman in that kind of pain who might 
take an Advil, that is actually a bad decision, that there 
are counterindications for all kinds of drugs that a woman 
in that kind of pain might even take on her own.  What are 
the dangers of some of these drugs?

<p>

MS. HSU: Well, I cannot speak to the narcotics --

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, there are different 
complications.  We do know that certain types of drugs like 
the ones you have mentioned can increase bleeding, can 
increase other complications.  The drugs are synthetic 
drugs, after all.  They are very powerful synthetic drugs.  
They are being introduced into an otherwise healthy and 
normal condition of female bodies -- that is, pregnancy.  
Pregnancy is not a disease.  There is nothing abnormal about 
a female body being pregnant.  It might be uncomfortable at 
certain times, but it is not abnormal, and it certainly is 
not a disease.

<p>

So you have these two powerful synthetic drugs 
being introduced into a healthy body.  Then you are asking 
perhaps for other interactions from different types of 
drugs.  If she does, for instance, use narcotics to try to 
numb the pain or to stem the bleeding, all kinds of further 
complications, because you are not then talking about one or 
two drugs, but maybe three or four different drugs, all 
going into an otherwise healthy body.  There is just no 
sanity in that, and it makes no logical sense to people on 
both sides of the issue to insist that this is a reasonable 
and logical course of action.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I want to ask more about that later, 
because what is interesting about RU-486 and the morning 
after pill is you see feminists and actually pro-abortion 
advocates saying, look, I am concerned about this chemical.

<p>

But Olivia, you understand abortion from a 
personal angle, as well. Can you tell us a little bit about 
your experience?

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, I am a mother of an aborted 
child. I did have an abortion in 1981, and I am very 
conscious of the ramifications of making that decision and 
also the dynamics that go into finding a woman in the 
position where she would even consider abortion a reasonable 
thing to do. I have also been working for 15 years now in 
the pro-life movement, for 10 of those years as the director 
of American Victims of Abortion, and I have worked with 14 
countries outside the United States, where I have had the 
opportunity to listen to other women like myself who have 
experienced surgical abortions and who recognize that 
abortion is always an act of violence committed against 
unborn children and their mothers, that both of us are 
harmed.  Our children lose their lives, and we may lose our 
lives, and here now we are talking about another effort on 
the part of abortion providers to expand the number of 
abortions being performed, to come up with yet another way 
to destroy our children, and leave women without the real 
life-affirming options that they seek.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you think from your 
experience and from working with women overseas, and 
obviously a lot of the RU-486 and chemical things have taken 
place in France and testing there, and other countries have 
been more aggressive in pursuing it.  How do you think women 
are psychological going to react to a surgical procedure 
versus something that could take a month, a month of 
bleeding, a month of pain, a month of doctors' visits? What 
is your assessment to date of the psychological trauma that 
that could give a woman?

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, unfortunately, as with all post-abortion 
syndrome complications, there has not been enough 
significant research, and what is present is anecdotal at 
best.  Now anecdotal research is valuable, because it sets 
the criteria for statistical research, but the evidence is 
pointing to serious trauma, the most powerful part of the 
trauma coming from the mother of this child actually having 
to identify the unborn child that she has passed and making 
sure that she has in fact passed her baby, that the baby has 
not remained inside, and she has simply experienced 
hemorrhaging.

<p>

She must, therefore, look at the result of having 
taken this drug with her own hand, and for many 
psychologists who work in the area of post-abortion 
syndrome, it is that dynamic, asking this woman to take with 
her own hand the drugs that are intended to kill her unborn 
child and then to identify that in fact her child is dead.  
That will be -- and I can tell you, as the mother of an 
aborted child, that will, in fact, I believe be the most 
profoundly affecting thing that occurs during the entire RU-486 
process.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, you do not really hear 
about that at all, Gracie.  You and I deal with this at 
Family Research Council, and we know that one of the biggest 
complications of this is if the child does not pass.  There 
can be infection.  There can be incredible bleeding, as the 
body attempts to follow through with the chemical process, 
but women must examine then everything.

<p>

MS. GANS: What they have been told is a product
of conception.  Remember that they have been told up to this
point you will be passing a clump of tissue, a lump type of
substance may pass from your body, and then what she sees is
what some people refer to as the teardrop baby.  Many people
may be familiar with the picture of a two-month-old child in
what is the shape of a teardrop, the amniotic sac, and there
inside is a perfectly formed tiny child whose eyes you can
see, whose tiny little developing hands are quite visible.
The spinal column is visible at that point.

<p>

All of these things can be seen if when she passes 
the amniotic sac it is more transparent than bloody, and 
that is what I believe is the height of cruelty to women to 
ask them to believe the unbelievable at that point.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gracie, this has been highly 
politicized by the FDA.  As we noted on the tape before, 
this has way been escalated beyond what we are looking at 
for other drugs.  Why are we looking at taking something not 
to deal with disease or injury?  Why are we escalating a 
chemical that causes an abortion when it is not as if there 
are not other abortion procedures available if that was what 
you wanted to choose?

<p>

MS. HSU: Well, that certainly is the question of 
the hour.  We know that President Clinton in one of his 
first acts of office removed the ban that would allow RU-486 
to be imported into the United States, and furthermore, Dr. 
David Kessler, who is the commissioner of the FDA, has also 
said on record in congressional hearings that he wants to 
see this put on a six-month fast track, and that, again, is 
purely political, and when we spoke to the population 
council on the day of the hearing itself, they said that the 
reason why they were pushing this, even with incomplete 
data, even with incomplete analysis of the U.S. clinical 
trial, they said that the reason why they are doing this now 
is because they want to do this before the presidential 
elections, because if on the small chance that President 
Clinton does not get reelected, then they will not have an 
advocate in the White House any more, and RU-486 would be 
dead in the water.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. We are going to have to 
hear more about this.  When we come back, we will hear more 
from our experts regarding RU-486 and the damaging effects 
it can have on children.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are continuing 
our discussion about RU-486.  We are joined by Dr. Camilla 
Hersh, an obstetrician and gynecologist who has worked on 
this issue, a long-time activist; Olivia Gans, director of 
American Victims of Abortion; and FRC policy analyst Gracie 
Hsu.  Welcome back, and welcome, Dr. Hersh.

<p>

DR. HERSH: Thank you, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, I have known you for a while 
now.  We were talking a little bit before about why this 
drug is coming quickly, kind of the political motivations, 
but one thing that has been problematic in the discussion is 
that as it is being discussed as so simple, and they are 
doing it in France, so why can't we do it here?  But what 
would be different about the way it is being discussed in 
application here than France?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Well, Kristi, I am really concerned 
about that, because, for one thing, in the French trials the 
whole procedure was very, very strictly controlled.  Each 
patient had to be registered by name, her address, where to 
find her, and France, compared to our country, is a 
relatively small place, and I have a lot of concerns about 
compliance in any trials or the release of this, the 
potential release of this terrible medication in our 
country.  We are a much bigger place.  We already have a 
much bigger problem with compliance.

<p>

One of the things that my patients often say to me 
when they describe their abortion experience is that halfway 
through, they really wish they could have changed their 
mind. They asked the doctor to stop.  They pleaded to stop.
But of course, things were so far along they could not stop, 
and I do not think it takes too much imagination to realize 
that once a woman takes the handful of drugs that they give 
her at the first visit and then she leaves, a lot of those 
women are not going to come back.  They are going to get on 
the plane and go back to Kansas City and see if Mom and Dad 
can help them out.  They are not going to complete the 
process.  We are going to have a large number of children 
deformed by this horrible drug.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What are some of the deformities 
that can take place?  I have read a vast amount of 
information about complications, but what first and foremost 
are the complications to any children that might result, and 
then what are other complications for the woman?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Well, of course, Kristi, it depends on 
what week in pregnancy the woman takes this medicine.  A lot 
of major organs are under formation at that point.  At the 
very end of the time that would be allowed to be given, the 
heart has been beating for three weeks, the little fingers 
are formed, but a couple weeks earlier, the midline facial 
features are coming together as the baby is being formed in 
the uterus.  Children that have been born that have had 
similar medications given at that point in pregnancy are 
missing limbs, missing the completion of their fingers, 
missing -- midline facial defects would be more common.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Like cleft palates?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Cleft palate, cleft lip, where the 
nose does not come all the way together in the center,
holopresencephaly[?] -- that is a long word for those
things.  And frankly, no one really knows, because there of 
course are not any studies where you could ethically test 
medicines that act at this point in pregnancy.  You just 
have to anticipate from the organs that are forming, and 
every two or three days, something major during that time in 
pregnancy is being formed.  All of our major organs are 
formed and in place by eight weeks from the last menstrual
period.  So it is a very critical time.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gracie, what has been the response 
of the Clinton administration and the FDA when groups like 
yours and Olivia's say we do not know enough about what is 
going to happen in RU-486, and frankly, we are pretty sure 
that American women are not going to comply as French women 
have?

<p>

MS. HSU: Yes, that was the most interesting 
result of this hearing.  A lot of the doctors on the 
committee did make reservations, and they did say we do not 
have complete U.S. data, we do not have all the information 
that we need, especially when it comes to compliance in the 
inner city and the low-income people who may be taking this 
drug and who may even be targeted because of this drug, but 
interestingly enough, they chose to gloss over it.  The 
chairperson of the group said, okay, with these reservations 
then, let's take these serious reservation under 
consideration, and let's vote anyway.  It was silly.  I 
mean, I think everybody who was in the audience, especially 
the press, could see that there were some major questions 
that were left unanswered but that they chose to continue in 
this process because they really wanted to get this through 
the FDA as soon as possible.

<p>

MS. GANS: If I may interject at this point, with 
relationship to what we know and don't know about RU-486, 
and I am sure Dr. Hersh can amplify this, but one of the 
things that is completely unknown really is the long-term 
effect on different population groups, which often have 
different health needs, different circumstances, dealing 
with their own biology because of different ethnicity 
sometimes, different issues. To say that we know what we 
need to know based on the experience of France or Sweden or 
Great Britain is completely erroneous, because one of the 
population groups, for instance, which has to be seriously 
considered separately from the general population are Native 
American women, and to my knowledge, there is a very small 
number of Native Americans living in Sweden.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

So it is incredibly scandalous, actually, that the 
FDA would suggest that we know what we need to know about 
this non-homogeneous population, which is the United States 
population, and we can go ahead and unleash this into an 
unsuspecting female population.

<p>

DR. HERSH: It is really a mockery of the 
standards that we expect to be in place to protect us as 
women in this country.  There are a number of population 
groups that are at greater, incredibly greater risk of 
complication with RU-486.  You mentioned Native Americans.  
African Americans, Asian Americans, and again, what portion 
of the populations of France and Sweden have any significant 
number of those individuals?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What percentage of the women in some 
of the testing had to have a surgical abortion because the 
follow-up showed that the abortion had not been completed 
with the chemicals?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Well, it varies. Depending on which 
of the studies you look at, anywhere from 2 to 13 percent.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And that is in a very controlled 
setting with a doctor checking you and with them being very 
able to ascertain that.

<p>

MS. GANS: But take that to its nth degree.  Two 
percent of what could be as many as 300,000 RU-486 abortions 
a year is upwards of 20,000 women requiring surgical 
abortions per year.

<p>

DR. HERSH: And that does not factor in that you 
can guarantee a certain percentage of women are not going to 
even comply to the point of coming for that second 
appointment. It is really frightening that the FDA can just 
gloss over. Imagine if our FDA had glossed over the 
complications, say, of thalidomide, which was a medicine 
used for nausea.  It was a wonderful medicine for nausea and 
pregnancy.  It was released in France and in Europe with a 
very minimal amount of testing, and there is a whole 
generation of thalidomide affected individuals who have no 
arms, have no legs. They are mentally intelligent, healthy 
people, but without any limbs it is hard to get along.

<p.

Our population was saved from that disaster 
because the FDA did not approve it.  There were not 
sufficient studies for use in pregnancy, and when there is 
something that is going to be used in such large numbers in 
this country, it is going to have tremendous repercussions, 
and who is going to bear the emotional, the financial -- 
name your risk.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to ask more 
about that in a moment.  Please stay tuned for more facts 
surrounding the newest in abortion methods, RU-486, when 
<i>Straight Talk</i> returns.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome once 
again our experts who are discussing the most recent pro-life 
battle, RU-486.  With us are Dr. Camilla Hersh, Olivia 
Gans, and Gracie Hsu.  Welcome back.

<p>

Gracie, one of the things that kind of is an 
interesting counter-melody to this entire discordant 
discussion about RU-486 is there have been a lot of people 
saying, look, we really do need to reform the federal Food 
and Drug Administration; the FDA has been too slow; we have 
not done enough for high risk people with AIDS and cancer.
So maybe the speeding up of RU-486 is a good thing, because 
it shows that the FDA is being more sensitive.

<p>

MS. HSU: Well, obviously not. It has shown that 
their priorities are all out of whack.  If you consider 
something like an AIDS patient or a cancer patient who has 
no other option and an experimental drug could do some good, 
the FDA should put that on a fast track.  The FDA should see 
that that gets first priority, not an abortion drug that has 
not cleared its final testing in the United States, that has 
not cleared a lot of the standards that the FDA normally 
recommends.

<p>

But beyond that, I think it is interesting that 
Congress right now is putting forward an FDA reform bill 
that would speed up the process for a lot of these life 
saving drugs, and this obviously is not -- RU-486 is not a 
life saving drug by any means.  Not only is it harmful for 
the child in question, but it is also harmful for the 
mother.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And in fact, there is a lot of -- 
one of the things that I have not read anything about except 
in pro-life literature is that some women would really be at 
high risk to take that.  It is not a one size fits all drug.  
What are some of the risk factors for women that would say, 
look, you in particular should not use this drug.

<p>

DR. HERSH: Kristi, there are several risk factors 
that are actually pretty ordinary.  Anyone who has asthma.  
Now a lot of people who have asthma do not think they have 
asthma.  They call themselves exercise wheezing or wheezing 
when they have allergies or wheezing when they have a cold, 
but in fact, they have low-level asthma.  Women who have 
asthma are at great risk for exacerbations of their asthma 
and cardiac arrest with these kinds of drugs.

<p>

Women who have recently taken anti-prostaglandins, 
which you think, well, I do not take any anti-prostaglandins, 
but how many times in the last week have you 
taken an Advil, a Nuprin, an Aleve.  Hello!

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

That makes you at increased risk for hemorrhage 
afterwards.  Anyone who has had uterine surgery, a recent 
cesarean section, anyone who has a history of ectopic 
pregnancy, anyone who has a history of pelvic infection, 
anyone who has a history of uterine fibroids.  Probably half 
of women by the time they reach age 40 have at least one 
fibroid.

<p>

The list goes on. Those are pretty common things 
for women to have. Women of Asian ancestry have a much 
higher risk of hemorrhage afterward.  There is no logical 
explanation for that; it needs to be studied, but they pick 
up a higher incidence of that.  One of the reasons that 
women of Native American descent have a higher problem is 
that they often have undiagnosed diabetes. Women with 
diabetes have a much higher complication. Women who smoke.

<p>

So you put together someone who is nervous, she is 
bleeding and passing clots, she took the second dose of 
medicine.  She does not know what to do.  She usually 
wheezes with stress.  She is starting to wheeze.  She quit 
smoking three weeks ago, and so she wrote on the form that 
she is not a smoker, but really she just has to have a 
cigarette, and maybe if she just took some of those Advil in 
the closet she would feel better.  You put those things 
together, and that is not an unusual thing, that scenario 
that I just put together. That is a person who may have her 
complications coalesce into a death.

<p>

Another thing that is very scary to me is in the 
few studies that have been done in this country, it seems 
already that the complications are being swept under the 
carpet.  There is the woman in Iowa --

<p>

MS. GANS: Perhaps the most -- that is Dr. Lavier's[?] case?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Right, hemorrhaged.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tell us about some of those complications.

<p>

MS. GANS:  Well, Camilla probably could explain it 
far better, but the simple story is that one of the women in 
the trials did begin to hemorrhage.  She lost a full half 
volume of her body content of blood before going to the 
emergency room.  The surgeon who was brought in was Dr. Mark 
Lavier, who was at the testimony the other day at the FDA 
hearing, and his concern was brought to the fore because 
shortly after treating this woman and saving her life -- she 
was on the verge of death when she was brought to the 
emergency room by her distraught husband -- he saved her 
life only to read in the papers just shortly thereafter the 
reports of Iowa Planned Parenthood that there were no 
complications in the Iowa trials.

<p>

DR. HERSH: When they were questioned, they said 
that complication was not outside the expected realm of 
complications.

<p>

MS. GANS: So death is expected.

<p>

DR. HERSH: Major hemorrhage requiring transfusion 
and near death is within the expected range of complication.  
As a woman, I find that frightening.  But that is not 
reported.  As a doctor, I find that frightening, that it is 
not reported as a complication.

<p>

MS. GANS: That is the most dangerous thing about 
the case with Lavier, as Dr. Hersh points out.  They tried 
to back up, once Dr. Lavier brought it to the presss 
attention.  There was no offer on their part to admit that 
there were complications.  It was only when Dr. Lavier 
brought it out and said wait a minute, you are telling half 
truths, because I treated one of the women who almost died 
in your trials.  Then they tried to back pedal and say that 
this was a reasonable complication which we can live with.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So death is a reasonable 
complication.  I mean, where are the women's rights
activists who are supposed to be champions of what is good 
for women?  I mean, we have lived through thalidomide.  We 
have lived through IUDs and the Dalkon shield and toxic 
shock and everything else. I mean, breast implants. You 
can't open a women's magazine without seeing a story on how 
horrible corporate America has been toward women.  Why 
aren't we worried about the implications of a drug like 
this?  Gracie, what are feminists saying?  Where are our so-called 
advocates on this?

<p>

MS. HSU: Well, they certainly are not on the side 
of women's health.  They are on the side of abortion and 
abortion alone. NARAL, NOW, all of these pro-feminist 
groups have come out saying that women want this drug, that 
women want to abort their children this way, and that this 
is a good thing, and unfortunately they have had to sweep 
aside the data, because the data clearly show that there are 
so many questions, so many complications that will occur.

<p>

DR. HERSH: And there is no information whatsoever 
about long-term complications from this drug.  If you simply 
look at the organ systems that this drug affects -- a 
person's uterus, her fertility -- what happens to someone 
who has maybe two of these kind of abortions within a 6-month 
period?

<p>

If you think about it, 40 percent or so of all 
abortions are repeat abortions.  What if someone uses this, 
as many people use with abortion, as basically a family 
planning method?  What happens when this builds up in your 
system?  What happens to your breast tissue?  The breast 
tissue is also in an incredible growing phase during early 
pregnancy, and this drug is going to act on the progesterone 
receptors in the breast tissue.

<p>

What is going to be the impact on breast cancer?
There are already some clues with other studies that the 
risk of breast cancer may be increased with just an ordinary 
-- if you can call any abortion ordinary -- surgical 
abortion.  What happens to the rest of our bodies? What 
happens to the fat storage where medicines build up? What 
happens to your risk of other long-term malignancies? There 
is no study.  There is not even any animal data on long-term 
complications.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, I am sure the animal rights would be better 
organized than women.

<p>

DR. HERSH: You can just count on it.

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, I think the bottom line here is 
who is organized on this issue are the pro-abortionists.
The abortion agenda is highly organized, totally mobilized 
on this front, and as we have said already, Bill Clinton's
agenda is part and parcel of their agenda. Probably the
only promises Bill Clinton has not broken are his promises 
to the abortion lobbying groups, and here we see the end 
result of that.

<p>

Bottom line here, what the abortion providers want
to see are more physicians performing abortions. They are
upset that doctors are getting out of the abortion business.
They want to see abortionists increased. They do not care 
at the end of the day whether women's lives are hanging in 
the balance, and they certainly do not care that their 
unborn children are dying.  So for many of these groups, as 
was stated at the trials, it was admitted that more 
physicians would perform abortions if this drug was 
available.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.

<p>

After this break, <i>Straight Talk</i> continues our 
discussion of RU-486.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are wrapping up our 
discussion of RU-486 with tonight's special guests, Dr. 
Camilla Hersh, Olivia Gans, and Gracie Hsu.

<p>

Olivia, I would like to ask you, working with the 
National Right to Life and certainly being long-term in this 
particular field, one of the success stories has been fewer 
and fewer physicians being willing to participate in 
abortion.  RU-486 kind of deals with that.  How does that 
work together?

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, let's understand why doctors 
don't want to be abortionists. Doctors do not want to be 
abortionists because they recognize that there are two 
people involved in every abortion decision, the mother and 
her unborn child, and of course, with the advent of all of 
what we know from ultrasound technology, the science of 
fetology, these doctors are now able to actually treat in 
the most minute ways this second patient, and suddenly now 
you are seeing young physicians, and older physicians, 
saying no, we will not be a part of this violent horrible 
act.  This is not why I became a doctor.  So these 
individuals are dropping out like flies, and thank Heavens 
they are.  They are not staying in the abortion business.

<p>

But the increase in RU-486 abortions precedes for 
some people what has been a problem with actually having to 
participate in a hands-on way killing the second patient.  
So the abortion providers presume that if the doctors do not 
actually have to lay hands on the second patient, more of 
them will become abortionists.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They would be willing to write a 
prescription and do what they would not do with their own 
hand.

<p>

MS. HSU: Data actually shows, for polling data, 
that a greater number of family practitioners and not 
surgical abortionists would choose to use RU-486, but beyond 
that, it is interesting, because family practitioners do not 
have necessarily the medical knowledge and the training to 
undertake the complications of an RU-486 that does not 
result in a complete abortion.  So what has happened is that 
the population council said in the testimony itself, oh, it 
is okay.  Any doctor, any medical student, is trained to do 
the gestational age, to do complications of pregnancy, and 
every single committee member shook their head and said no, 
you have to be trained to do surgical abortions.

<p>

DR. HERSH: It does bring up a different kind of 
compliance problem.  We have talked some about the 
compliance problem of the patient who changes her mind or 
doesn't follow the directions or doesn't come back, but the 
compliance of the abortionist, the chemical abortionist, if 
you will, is that unless you are experienced in the use of a 
particular procedure or a protocol, the chance of mistakes 
is going to be very high -- giving the wrong amount of 
medication, giving it at the wrong time, diagnosing how far 
along in the pregnancy the woman is, knowing how to follow 
basically the management of an intentional induced 
miscarriage, whether the woman has passed all the parts of 
the baby, whether she is developing an infection afterward, 
how much bleeding is a normal amount of bleeding, how much 
bleeding is a non-normal amount of bleeding.

<p>

If you did then need to do a surgical abortion 
after a partial abortion, whether it is spontaneous or 
induced, the uterus is a much more fragile organ at that 
time, the chance of perforation and further damage, 
lacerating the cervix.  I could probably go on and on, but 
you are right.  There is much more chance of basically 
medical malcompliance as you have fewer trained people 
following the patient carefully.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure. You even have the abortion 
advocates almost bragging that you could have nurses or 
physicians assistants involved.  We can cut the doctor out 
totally.

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, you have to look at what has 
happened to those of us that have had abortions.  Since 
abortion was legalized, we have seen the casual disregard of 
the woman as patient, let alone -- obviously the baby is 
invisible, completely irrelevant in this experience, but now 
women are --

<p>

DR. HERSH: But these babies will not be so 
invisible.  We are going to see thousands and thousands of 
birth defects entering our society as a result of 
incompleted chemical abortions.

<p>

MS. GANS: The only thing I would say is that in 
fact they are claiming that doctors will have more attention 
to their patients and more understanding, and they cannot 
possibly, because as women have been treated more and more 
like cardboard objects on the table, as the abortionist 
kills their children, and the assembly line of the abortion 
industry has continued, this is just another way to speed up 
the assembly line process and to once again remove all 
connection and all responsibility for the decision that is 
actually being made.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gracie, we have about 20 seconds 
left. This could come up quickly. Tell me how quickly.

<p>

MS. HSU: We can see this within the next 2 months 
perhaps. The full agency of the FDA will come out in favor 
of recommending this for marketing in the United States.
One of the most problematic things is that the one
manufacturer that is going to do this, this RU-486, is 
called Advances in Health Technologies.  They are a brand-new 
corporation.  We do not know whether they are going to 
be manufacturing here or overseas, and they do not have any 
assets.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to get phone 
numbers, and we are going to invite our -- thank you to my 
guests, and I certainly hope people will call, and when 
<i>Straight Talk</i> returns, you will hear how you can receive 
more information regarding the issues affecting you and your 
family. Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us here at

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we are live from the Republican
National Convention.  It has already been an exciting few
days, and you have probably seen Gary Bauer, Family Research
Council's president, on many networks and on news shows. We
hope you have been watching the national policy debate and
seen Gary fighting for family issues during the Republican
platform hearings and on the floor of the convention.

<p>

Tonight we bring you more about those issues and
what the Republican Party promises for your family in the
future with some very special guests, including former 
Republican Presidential candidate, Ambassador Alan Keyes.

<p>

But first, let's go to Family Research Council's 
Kristin Hansen, who is live on the convention floor.
Kristin, I know that they have started the coverage. What 
do we have to look forward to this evening?

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Hi, Kristi. We are going to have so 
much fun this evening.  We have a great lineup of 
interviews.  We are going to be first talking with Rick 
Santorum and, hopefully, Senator Dan Coates later on.  We 
have the Young Republicans behind us.  So it is sure to be a 
fun evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Kristin, I can't wait to hear more, 
and we are going to be talking to Kristin throughout 
tonight's show.  But first I would like to introduce a key 
player in pro-life policies and the platform hearings, 
Colleen Parro, Executive Director of the Republican National 
Coalition for Life; and I am also joined by Marty 
Dannenfelser, who is Family Research Council's leader of our 
government relations.  Welcome, both of you.

<p>

Colleen, you all have been working for a long time 
getting us to this point.  The convention means, really, 
your work is done.  What has gone into getting us here, 
especially those interested in pro-life policies?

<p>

MS. PARRO: Well, a lot of hard work. We have 
reached out to pro-life Republican primary voters for the 
last five years, letting them know that the threat to the 
pro-life plank was real and that there was something that 
they needed to do about it.  We encouraged them to get 
involved in their precinct and county and state conventions; 
to get elected a delegate to the Republican National 
Convention, if possible, and many of them have done so; and 
in addition to that, to try to get on the Platform 
Committee, and many of them did that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So the pro-life platform that we saw 
come together last week was a five-year process.

<p>

MS. PARRO: Well, yes, actually. We have had a 
pro-life plank in the Republican Party platform since 1976 
calling for a human life amendment to the Constitution.  But 
the effort to overturn that really started in earnest by 
Republicans for Choice in 1992, and they have continued 
their efforts to try to strip the pro-life plank from the 
Republican platform.  We expect that they will continue to 
do that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would think so.

<p>

MS. PARRO: And that is why it is so important for 
people to get involved in the process and to be here every 
four years to make the statement that this is the pro-life 
party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty, you have been on Capitol Hill 
for 20-some years and now with Family Research Council.  How 
important is the platform in GOP politics?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it is particularly 
important when you have a Republican President.  I can 
remember when Reagan and Bush were both in the White House 
and there were some staff who might have tried to steer them 
in one direction or another.  It was very helpful to be able 
to go back and say this is the position that is in the 
platform, and there would be letters signed by Members of 
Congress, and so on, that would reinforce that point.

<p>

So it is very important because it is a point at 
which people really get focused on policy.  You do hear a 
lot of people say, "Well, it is ignored after the 
convention."  But that is not really the case.  It really 
does set the blueprint for the policies that are in effect 
by the Congress but more particularly when you do have a 
President of the same party in the White House.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I know it hasn't escaped your 
attention, Colleen, that Vice President Al Gore and 
President Clinton at one time said they were both pro-life.
How do you help people remember their pro-life grass roots,
you might say?

<p>

MS. PARRO: Well, what is important for us to 
remember is that the platform is an excellent platform, and 
it is pro-life, but it takes grass-roots pressure from the 
bottom up to make sure that elected officials attempt, at 
least, to turn the principles in the platform into public 
policy and law.

<p>

We are seeing somewhat of an erosion of that 
support among the Republican leadership in Congress.  We 
cannot afford to let down on our job, which is to hold them 
accountable to the platform and to not be afraid to stand up 
to your local Congressman and say, "Hey, wait a second.  We 
want to restore the right to life in this country.  What are 
you doing to get that done?"

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, as somebody who has been on 
Capitol Hill, Marty, that kind of pressure, does that work?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: It does. Like I say, we would 
get Members of Congress to sign letters.  You might get 20, 
30, 40, 50 Members of Congress to point out in a letter to 
the White House, this was the position in the platform; this 
is the position that we expect to abide by.  It has been 
helpful to have that in there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Standing by with Kristin Hansen, we 
have Senator Rick Santorum, a pro-life fighter, a real 
leader.  Senator, thank you so much for being with us on 
<i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: Well, thank you. It's good to 
be with you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Kristin, have the Senator talk to us 
about the importance of the kind of policy debate that we 
have seen take place over the last week.

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: Well, I think what we have come 
out and done in this convention with this platform is we 
have stood up for principle; that we have made very direct 
statements as to what the Republican Party believes in.

<p>

You know, I am a conservative who was elected in 
Pennsylvania, in a state where they say you cannot elect a 
conservative. What I found out, and what Spence Abraham 
found out in Michigan, and Mike DeWine in Ohio, is that what 
the voter wants is someone who is going to provide a clear 
vision for this country, who is going to stand up and fight 
for what they believe in.

<p>

They don't expect to agree with you on every 
issue.  But what they do expect you to do is to stand up and 
be honest, be forthright, and to deliver what you said you 
were going to do.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, I am sure that you have 
seen that Jack Kemp is our new Vice Presidential candidate, 
used to represent New York, right on the border of 
Pennsylvania, a big football player.  Tell us, how do you 
think the Jack Kemp selection plays in Pennsylvania?

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: I think it will be very 
helpful.  Northwestern Pennsylvania, which obviously borders 
the Buffalo area and in fact gets a lot of the Buffalo 
television, is going to be a very strong area for us.  We 
just elected a governor from up in that area, and it is a 
swing area which we are going to do very well in now as a 
result of Jack.  Jack played football in Pittsburgh, frankly 
not very well. He only played five games for the Steelers.
But, you know, he lived there, he is known there a little 
bit, people remember him, and I think it will be a plus for 
him.

<p>

And just his message. I mean, Jack has such an 
inclusive message that is really going to help us in cities 
like Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, where we are going to 
reach into communities that frankly are not traditional 
Republican areas. So I think, overall, that vision, that 
energy is going to be very helpful in Pennsylvania.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One last question, Senator, and I 
really appreciate your taking the time to be with us.  There 
has been a lot of talk about inclusiveness in the big tent, 
but would the Republican Party be a pro-life party?  How 
would you describe its commitment on that issue?

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: Well, I don't think there is 
any question that the platform is clear.  I mean, we are a 
pro-life party, and the Democratic Party is a pro-abortion 
party. I don't use the term "pro-choice" because what the 
Democratic Party platform is, abortion on demand at any time 
during the pregnancy for any reason.  I mean, that is the 
extremist plank on abortion.  That is the plank on abortion 
that is well out of the mainstream, and I think we contrast 
very well with a party that says life is important, and that 
we stand up and we respect the right to life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Fantastic!

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Senator, we had read that Dan 
Quayle, in his draft comments for this evening, was going to 
mention President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth 
abortion ban.  Have you heard anything more up to date on 
that?

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: I am not, but I am working 
very, very diligently on trying to override that veto.  I 
mean, the President allowing that barbaric procedure to 
occur is just -- what a horrible commentary it is on the 
moral leadership of this country, and frankly, if we don't 
override it in the House and Senate and the American public 
doesn't mobilize behind this, I think it is a horrible 
commentary on this country as a whole if we allow that to 
continue.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. PARRO: Senator, I have a question for you.  I 
am wondering, since Senator Dole the other day said that he 
had not yet read the platform and that, if he did, he would 
not feel bound by it, what efforts do you think are going to 
be made among Republicans to see to it that the Dole-Kemp 
ticket actually runs on the platform?

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: Well, you know, I think Bob 
Dole is making the statement like you would about a piece of 
legislation.  I haven't read every word of it, but I 
generally agree with its direction, and he is going to run 
on the themes and issues that were in the platform.

<p>

Bob Dole's record on the pro-life issue is 100 
percent; his record on most of the issues in the platform is 
right in line with that platform.  I mean, I think we 
shouldn't worry too much and picket our candidate.  I think 
what we should do is recognize that with a Bob Dole 
Presidency and with a Republican Congress, we are going to 
move forward on a lot of fronts that Bill Clinton is 
stopping us on right now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, as a former Pennsylvanian, 
I have to tell you that my parents are always telling me 
what a champion you are.  We really appreciate your being 
with us on <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

When we come back, we are going to have more, live from San Diego.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are very excited to have you back 
with us at <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>
where we are broadcasting live from the 1996 Republican 
National Convention.

<p>

We have Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell at the 
podium.  A lot of you may be watching.  There are a lot of 
issues that we are talking about here that affect you and 
your family, and we have been going to a lot of trouble to 
bring you some of the best in the business to give you 
insight into pro-family issues, other family issues.

<p>

I am joined by a very special guest, Ambassador 
Alan Keyes, and also Marty Dannenfelser from the Family 
Research Council.  Thank you.  It is a privilege to have you 
here with us.

<p>

How does it feel?  You obviously were making your 
way to San Diego, thinking perhaps that you would be 
candidate, and now you are here watching all this take 
place.  What kinds of thoughts are going through your mind?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, actually, my campaign, as 
I said repeatedly on the trail, was not so much about Alan 
Keyes becoming the nominee as it was about making sure this 
party stayed on track with its moral principles, its pro-life 
principles, that we had a strong pro-life plank in the 
platform, that we had a ticket in which the Vice 
Presidential candidate and others were not pro-abortion.

<p>

I think we have achieved all those objectives at 
this convention. I feel very pleased about that. I think 
there are, obviously, still some problems.  The convention 
organizers want to project, for reasons best known to 
themselves, an image of the party as a pro-abortion party  
that is not committed to the principles of the platform.  I 
think that is a great mistake.  But I think that we did 
succeed in making sure that the delegates who come to this 
convention are true to Republican principles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I mean, it is quite a pendulum if 
you think about it.  We started with maybe Christine Todd 
Whitman and maybe Colin Powell as a Vice Presidential 
candidate and let's get rid of the platform to Jack Kemp and 
a strong pro-life platform.  Do you think that a lot of what 
you were talking about maybe might have changed that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, I think it had an impact.
A lot of people were doing a lot of hard work in that
regard:  Phyllis Schlaffly, Gary Bauer, Jim Dobson, others
who had the courage and heart to speak up and to send a
clear, strong signal to Bob Dole, to the Republican Party
leadership, that the grass-roots Republicans were not going
to tolerate an abandonment of the pro-life principle and
that that would not be the best route for the Republican
Party.

<p>

I think, in any case, this fear of the pro-life 
issue on the part of the leadership is inexplicable, since 
the pro-life position has been our position, as we have 
gained strength all around the country, won Presidential 
elections, taken back the Congress.  I think if they pretend 
that there is some political liability involved here, it is 
a lie and they know it, and that some of them are doing it 
simply because they are not really committed to the moral 
principles that then lead to the pro-life position.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty, you have seen the impact of 
Presidential races on Capitol Hill.  What happens as leader 
like Ambassador Keyes speak out on the life issue?  What 
kind of buzz happens on Capitol Hill?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it emboldens people who 
support the pro-life position, and it is very encouraging to 
those pro-life Members of Congress who sometimes get 
discouraged by their own leadership's lack of willingness to 
speak out on the issues.  So it is important to have people 
with the moral courage of Alan Keyes out there speaking 
forthrightly to the issues and speaking with clarity as to 
why this is so central to our national purpose.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have been talking to a lot of the 
delegates about why they are here, and it was interesting 
that more than half, almost 60 percent of the delegates, are 
first-time delegates.

<p>

As we have been doing some of the pro-life 
activities through RNC for Life and, obviously, Gary Bauer 
at Family Research Council talking to them, a good many of 
them got into this just because of their concern for the 
unborn.  And yet, earlier today, I was in Voice of America 
in a debate where a gentleman from Republicans for Choice 
was telling me that the abortion issue is a killer for the 
Republican Party.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, you know, that is, as I 
say, the simple lie that has been spread.  I don't believe 
that even the people who tell that lie think that it is 
true, since all of the polling that was done after 1992 
showed pretty clearly that the pro-life position did not 
hurt George Bush; it was his stand on taxes and his failure 
to keep his no-new-taxes pledge that hurt him.

<p>

It is also clear that, in 1994, overwhelmingly, 
pro-life, moral Republicans accounted for our ability to 
take the Congress from the Democrats.  How can that be a 
political liability?  It makes no sense.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have standing by Kristin Hansen 
on the convention floor.  Kristin, whom do you have with you 
now?

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Hi, Kristi. Right here with me I 
have Mr. Marco Gillam(?).  Mr. Gillam, where are you from?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: San Antonio, Texas.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: San Antonio, Texas?  And why have you 
come here to the convention?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: I am an alternate from the 20th 
Congressional District.  We don't have a Congressman there 
because his name is Henry D. Gonzalez.  We want to get more 
Republicans in the Congress.  We want to get a Republican in 
the White House.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: And what have you got here?  Oh, 
you're wearing a hat.  What does the hat say?

<p>

MR. GILLAM:  The hats are distributed by the 
Republican National Coalition for Life, a pro-life 
organization, and most of the Texas delegation is wearing 
it.  Fortunately, they go with our ties and our Texas 
accents.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: How do you think the Dole-Kemp ticket 
will do in Texas?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: They will carry Texas easily.  We are 
very excited that Jack Kemp is aboard.  I feel we are going 
to go forward together now and defeat Bill Clinton.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Mr. Gillam, how do you feel the life 
issue plays in Texas?  Do you see any kind of a drag on the 
ticket?  Certainly a lot of media coverage this week has 
indicated that it has been a bad thing for the GOP.  What is 
your position?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: What, the pro-life issue, did you say?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is correct.

<p>

MR. GILLAM: I think the majority of Texans are 
pro-life.  I know our delegation and the grass roots we 
represent who elected us up the line are opposed to 
abortion, especially partial-birth abortion.

<p>

It is an exaggerated issue. The pro-abortionists, 
I feel, are basing their arguments strictly on emotion.  I 
don't think it is going to be a drag.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty, how have you seen -- as the 
different delegations have been put together, some have 
tried to say that it is not that the majority of Americans 
are pro-life but that they control the process.  Do you 
think that is accurate?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, the pro-life people have 
been very committed to getting their people elected during 
this process.  That part is true.  But I think you see all 
too often that the network camera people and the talking 
heads in the news booths are very much out of step with the 
American people on the life issue, and they repeatedly frame 
the issue in a way that is not really representative of the 
true pro-life position.  But the grass roots do oppose most 
abortions in most circumstances, and the polls have been 
showing that repeatedly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Mr. Gillam, you are standing by, I 
know.  Have you seen the life issue to be the majority 
position of your fellow statesmen, or do you think it is 
that you have been more involved in the process?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: Could you repeat the question?  I 
could barely hear you, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure. Do you think that the pro-life 
position is that of the state of Texas, or do you think 
you guys have just been more active in the process?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: I can't hear hardly at all.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Okay.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, Mr. Gillam, thanks so much for 
being with us, and I am going to ask that same question to 
Ambassador Keyes.  Ambassador, what is your perspective?  Do 
we control the process or do we have the philosophy on our 
side?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, two things are true.
One, I think it is true that pro-life moral conservatives 
are more active in the process.  That also means, of course,
come election day, they are going to be more active in 
distributing the literature, more active in carrying people 
to the polls, more active in knocking on doors, more active 
in spreading the word.  So their activism goes beyond the 
pro-life issue and really becomes the key asset for 
Republicans on election day, the activism of that moral 
conservative core of the party. Without them, I don't think 
we can win victories.

<p>

I also think that the election results would 
suggest that this business of pro-life being somehow not the 
view of the people is wrong.  If that is the case, why is it 
that pro-life conservatives can stand up, run for office, 
and win?  Why did they win overwhelmingly in the course of 
the 1994 election?  Why is it that not a single pro-life 
incumbent in the Congress was defeated on the Republican 
side in that election?

<p>

So I don't understand where these arguments come 
from when the facts simply don't track with this notion that 
the pro-life position is a political liability.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: You know, yesterday there was 
another primary in the state of Colorado, and the pro-life 
candidate in the Republican primary won a very decisive 
victory against a pro-abortion candidate.  A week earlier, 
there were three pro-life candidates in the states of 
Kansas, Georgia, and Michigan that won their victories, and 
it was a clear-cut challenge between pro-life and pro-abortion 
in all three cases.

<p>

So time after time we have seen this. We saw Pete 
Wilson and Arlan Specter run in the Presidential race.  
Their candidacies went nowhere, and it came down to 
competition between several pro-life candidates.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have a call on the line.  It is 
Nancy from New York.  Nancy, do you have a question for 
Ambassador Keyes or a comment about what we are watching 
right now?

<p>

CALLER FROM MILESSES, NEW YORK: Well, Ambassador 
Keyes, I think you're great.  I love you.  I would have 
voted for you or a libertarian, but I don't like the 
libertarian view on a strong defense.  I think that is 
imperative.

<p>

But I wanted to say is I don't know why you give 
the courtesy to the Democratic Party to say they are pro-choice. 
They are pro-death.  To me, pro-choice is my choice 
between abstinence and free sex.  When you get under that 
umbrella, it is either pro-life or pro-death.  It is the 
guilt of the women in America.  We don't understand there is 
grace for us, and the inability of us to say, "We were 
wrong.  It's death.  I'm guilty.  Forgive me."  That's it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Nancy, that is a very interesting 
point that you raise, and I want to make a point for all of 
you watching that you can call if you call 1-800-5000-NET 
with a question for Ambassador Keyes, who is going to stay 
with us through the show.

<p>

But, Ambassador, what is your response to Nancy's point?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think she is correct.
Generally speaking -- I mean, I don't know if I said 
something to the contrary just a few minutes ago -- but I 
use the phrase "pro-abortion," not "pro-choice."  I think 
that the pro-choice slogan was a very shrewd one.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: In one way it does raise an 
issue, because I think what these people represent is the 
view that freedom consists of making any choice you please, 
and we know that if you define it that way, it then becomes 
a curse because it implies that there is no responsibility, 
no moral discipline, and that in turn undermines your 
ability to maintain a decent society and strong institutions 
in that society like the family.

<p>

So I think in that respect the notion that they 
are pro-choice does convey something about their 
irresponsibility.  But the truth is, in this context, they 
are pro-abortion and pro-death, just as the caller says, and 
generally speaking, I use that phrase "pro-abortion" because 
I think that this notion that I am against abortion but, 
which then leads to a tolerance for the sanctioning of this 
as a legal matter, that basically is a cop-out, and it 
leaves the evil abroad, which means that you support its 
existence.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have another caller on the line.
1-800-5000-NET for you to call and participate in this to 
ask a question for Ambassador Keyes or make a comment about 
what is going on behind us.

<p>

Again, we are live from San Diego.  We are going 
to look forward to talking with you.  Stay tuned as <i>Straight
Talk</i> brings you more of the national GOP convention.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are live from the 
Republican National Convention, where we are talking to a 
true warrior for America's families, Ambassador Alan Keyes, 
and Marty Dannenfelser, our Director of Government Relations 
at Family Research Council.

<p>

Behind us, former Governor Carroll Campbell is 
talking, but I understand that Kristin Hansen has a special 
guest with her.  Kristin, you have Senator Coates with you?

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Yes. Hi. I am down here on the 
floor with Senator Dan Coates of Indiana, definitely a 
champion of the pro-family movement.

<p>

Senator, we have been here with the Family 
Research Council working with the platform hearings, and we 
were definitely happy with the way things went last week.
And now I know definitely people in the pro-family movement 
are interested in the Dole-Kemp ticket, and how are they 
going to stick to the platform in the next couple of months 
and in their campaign?  What do you think we are hoping to 
see with the Dole-Kemp ticket and the platform?

<p>

SENATOR COATES: You know, we were all pretty 
happy with the way the platform came out, and it is a 
document that I think forms the foundation of our party, 
what we believe and where we think the party ought to go, 
where America ought to go.

<p>

But the reality of it is not that piece of paper.
It is the translation of that paper into the reality of 
action of legislation, of carrying out the basis for all the 
various agendas and programs that are incorporated in that 
document.  That has to be a decision of the President, the 
Vice President, and the party to say we are going to take 
that piece of paper and we are going to turn it into 
reality.  That is our job, to make sure that that happens.

<p>

I really believe that the Dole-Kemp ticket and the 
people they will surround themselves with will advocate what 
we believe and share in our beliefs in terms of 
demonstrating to the American people that we care about the 
values, the underlying fundamental values that are important 
to the future of this country.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: What do you think people in Indiana 
are looking for in action under the Dole-Kemp ticket, 
especially families?

<p>

SENATOR COATES:  Well, I think they want to see a 
recognition of the fact that the family is the most 
important building block of society.  There is no government 
agency that will replace the family.  And, therefore, what 
we can do to strengthen the family, both through the tax 
code, through government policies that don't impact 
negatively on the family but rather encourage family 
formation, a strong declaration that the family is the 
essential foundation of America and we are not going to 
broaden that definition to include all different forms of 
what some people think constitutes a family, I think those 
are essential elements of what ought to be done in the next 
four years.

<p>

Also, I think we have to recognize that the family 
is torn asunder these days in many of our communities, in 
many of our neighborhoods.  And to the extent that we can 
reach out with proactive, conservative social programs, many 
of which I have outlined in my Project for American Renewal, 
to strengthen the family, I think that we need to take an 
active voice.

<p>

So there is a lot that we can do to change the 
definition and the direction that this current 
administration has taken in regard to the family and bring 
us back to a traditional base.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Kristin, if you can hear me, or 
Senator Coates, Senator, you are well known for working on 
welfare reform and on compassionate and community 
involvement.  How do you think welfare reform is going to be 
a part of this coming election battle?

<p>

SENATOR COATES: Well, the resolution that we have 
come up with in Congress and that Bill Clinton has signed is 
a recognition that the American people's voice has been 
heard as far as the White House, and Bill Clinton 
politically could not afford not to sign that.

<p>

I have defined this as step one of the welfare 
revolution.  We have taken the important step of 
transferring power out of Washington back to the states.  We 
have taken the important step of telling people that we are 
no longer going to allow them to live a lifetime of 
dependence on the Federal Government paying the bills; that 
they are going to have to get a job, they are going to have 
to take responsibility for their children, they are going to 
have to take responsibility for their lives.  We will help 
them in the transition, but it is a transition, and there is 
an endpoint to it.

<p>

But the second step ought to be to energize those 
institutions like the church, like the family, like 
volunteer associations, like Habitat for Humanity, church- 
or faith-based organizations to deal with some of these 
social problems that break down the family that government 
has not successfully dealt with.

<p>

We have spent trillions of dollars at the federal 
level with lousy results, terrible results, so we have 
condemned people to lifetimes of dependency.  And yet there 
are organizations across America that don't rely on 
government for their funding and for their ideas that are 
just reaching out with Christian love, reaching out with an 
involvement of themselves in other people's lives and 
bringing the transforming power that spiritual renewal can 
bring to lives, and that is where our future is in terms of 
how we deal with a lot of these problems.  They will not be 
solved in Washington.  Washington can feed the body, but it 
cannot feed the soul.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, thank you so much for being 
with us today on <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>.

<p>

SENATOR COATES: Sure.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We really appreciate that, and 
thanks for your leadership on welfare reform.

<p>

SENATOR COATES: Thank you very much.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Ambassador Keyes and Marty both, how 
do you think welfare reform debate and those kinds of values 
issues are going to play and have been playing?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think that it is kind of hard 
to see how welfare reform is going to be an issue in this 
election campaign given that the Congress and the President 
just agreed on a welfare reform effort which they passed, 
and you saw it.

<p>

That, by definition, kind of knocks the issue off 
the table as a point of difference, unless Bob Dole can 
define a bold proposal that would take things further than 
they have been taken as yet by the Republican Congress 
working with the President.

<p>

I think that is one of the dangers of progress in 
terms of reaching agreement on an issue just before an 
election.  Sometimes people say that prevents any progress 
from taking place before election time, but clearly, both 
the Congress and the President in this case thought that it 
was smarter for them to be seen doing something in an 
election year than just fighting about it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But, Marty, we at the Family 
Research Council, and you in particular, have been working 
on things like the family cap and dealing with not extending 
additional benefits as more children are born out of wedlock 
into the home.  Why have you seen the family cap as being 
important in welfare reform, and where is that right now?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, the parliamentary process 
in getting the bill passed prevented that family cap from 
being included in the final product.  It was in the bill 
that was passed by the House of Representatives, but it got 
knocked out under a parliamentary objection in the Senate 
because of the process they were using to get the bill 
passed.

<p>

However, the bill does take away the need for many 
of the states to go hat in hand to the Federal Government to 
get waivers to implement that family cap and other similar 
proposals at the state level.  So that will probably be a 
boost that the states can do these things more on their own.

<p>

I think another interesting question is going to 
be what happens down the road, because some of these 
programs are going to remain in place for a few years and 
then be phased out, and there was a battle between the 
Clinton White House and the Congress about whether or not to 
extend the benefits after five years, and they did allow 
them to use federal funds through some other programs other 
than welfare after five years.  So that is still going to be 
something to see if there is an effort to maintain this 
federal support for welfare, or will it truly be turned over 
to the states at the end of that time period?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems like family tax relief has 
been the favorite theme of the Republican convention to 
date, but a lot of moral issues -- life, welfare reform -- 
have been very hard-fought and hard-won.  We are going to 
talk about what other issues we think are important in this 
next election cycle.

<p>

Remember, if you are watching at home, you are 
welcome to call us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we are going to hear 
more from Alan Keyes and Kristin Hansen and Marty 
Dannenfelser, more here live at the Republican National 
Convention.  Join us after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i> is back with more live coverage of the 
Republican National Convention.  We are talking to you from 
the convention floor, and we are joined by a man who has his 
own followings of supporters amongst the Republican Party, 
Ambassador Keyes.

<p>

We have Kristin Hansen on the convention floor,
but we also have a caller on the line from Vermont. Hi.
Welcome to <i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

CALLER FROM FAIRLEE, VERMONT:  Hi.  Ambassador 
Keyes, it is a distinct honor to address to you two short,
interrelated questions:  If abortion is considered a woman's 
private choice, then why is it paid for with public funds?
Isn't this taxation without representation?  Thank you very 
much.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think it is a very good 
question.  I think it really makes us all, as supporters of 
the public treasury, complicit in a choice that many people 
regard as immoral and that they are saying is entirely the 
private choice of that individual.  But if it is entirely a 
private matter, why should it be supported with public 
funds?  There is a contradiction there, and I think that 
contradiction actually points to the fact that this is not a 
private matter at all; that it is in fact a matter of 
concern because it violates an important public principle of 
justice, which is that all men are created equal and endowed 
not by their mothers' choice but by the Creator God with 
their unalienable rights.

<p>

So I think you are right; that is a contradiction 
that shows that within that pro-abortion position there is a 
self-confessed error where they try to say it is a private 
thing and then want to support it with public funds.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take another call now, Ed from 
Pittsburgh.  Ed, are you with us?

<p>

CALLER FROM PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA:  Yes, I am here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And what is your question or comment?

<p>

CALLER FROM PITTSBURGH: First of all, it is a 
distinct honor to speak with you, Ambassador Keyes. The 
first question I have is, were you or would you consider 
being a running mate for Senator Dole?  And the second 
question is, are we going to see you back on track in the 
year 2000?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, as I often told people, 
the man who thought that Colin Powell might be his first 
choice didn't have Alan Keyes second on his list.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And I think it took, to tell you the honest truth, 
a lot of honest pressure from moral conservative groups to 
make it clear to Bob Dole that that pro-abortion temptation 
was a bad idea, and he finally ended up with Jack Kemp, who 
doesn't emphasize the pro-life issue, is not really a pro-life 
leader but at least has a solid record of support for 
the pro-life position.

<p>

So I think that that is about the best we could 
have hoped for, given the strong temptation that Bob Dole 
seemed to have in the other direction, and that, 
unfortunately, is also exemplified in the lineup at this 
convention, which seems to be afraid of standing forward and 
presenting to the American people the clear argument for the 
pro-life position, which I think is a unifying argument that 
inspires Americans.  It is not, as they are trying to make 
us believe, a divisive argument.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you very much, Ambassador.

<p>

We have another caller, Heather, in Fayetteville, 
Tennessee.  Heather, thanks for joining us on <i>Straight Talk</i>.
Your question or comment?

<p>

CALLER FROM FAYETTEVILLE, TENNESSEE: Yes. I
would like to know why, every time I turn on the TV and 
watch the convention, all I see is pro-abortion speakers.  I 
don't see any pro-life speakers.

<p>

I will say I cannot vote for Bob Dole, I will not 
vote for him, I don't trust him, and you know, as they say, 
to get elected you run conservative, and once you are in 
office, you govern liberal.  Bill Clinton did it.

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, that's what they say: run right and govern left.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think the caller puts her 
fingers on something that I have been disturbed about, that 
many others have pointed out, have been disturbed at.  As I 
say, they are putting a pro-abortion face on the Republican 
Party in spite of the fact that the body is strongly pro-life, 
and they claim that this is because there is some 
political liability in the pro-life position, but that claim 
is not supported by the facts.

<p>

That would lead me to think that some of the 
leaders who are pushing us in this direction are doing it 
because they want to jettison the pro-life position because 
they do not believe in pro-life principles and because they 
are looking, I think, to form an immoral coalition between 
the forces of unbridled greed and the forces of unbridled 
lust, and I don't think that is going to be good for the 
country or good for the Republican Party, and I think they 
should stop it, and I will be recommending as much as I can 
to Bob Dole, to Jack Kemp, and to others that they 
understand the winning position for this slate is going to 
be one that points to Bill Clinton's anti-moral, anti-family 
positions and really drives home the fact that we need a 
better alternative, not one that emphasizes economics to the 
exclusion of morality.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to take some 
more callers in a moment, but first let's go to the 
convention floor. Kristin, you are standing by with Senator 
Rod Grams.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Yes, we have Senator Rod Grams from 
Minnesota.  Senator, thanks so much for joining us.

<p>

SENATOR GRAMS: Thanks, Kristin. My pleasure to be here.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: I would like to ask you, we have 
heard a lot about hope, growth, and opportunity in the last 
couple of nights.  I would like to ask you, can we 
realistically cut the taxes 15 percent and reduce the 
deficit?  How will that help families, and how should 
families be watching that?

<p>

SENATOR GRAMS: Well, when we talk about cutting 
taxes, what are we really saying?  We are saying that we are 
going to let families and individuals keep more of the money 
that they work so hard for rather than sending it to 
Washington, so that they can be in control and make the 
decisions how best to provide for their children and their 
family needs. So we need to cut taxes to give them that 
opportunity.

<p>

Second, we need to reduce taxes so that we can 
have economic growth.  I mean, that money is going to be 
spent.  It is going to be spent by families and not by the 
government.

<p>

So it is not a question of either balance the 
budget or give tax relief; that is not an either/or.  The 
question is, we can increase this pie through economic 
growth so we can give tax relief, provide more revenues, 
because we will have more workers and lower taxes, and we 
can balance the budget.

<p>

So it is something that goes hand in hand. It is 
like a hand-in-a-glove type of mentality.  But when the 
Democrats say that we cannot afford to do it, what they are 
saying is the era of big government isn't over, and we want 
that money in Washington rather than in your pockets.

<p>

So it is very important.  There is a big 
difference between our agenda and theirs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, thank you so much for being 
with us.  Unfortunately, we have to go to a break shortly.
But do you think we will get that $500-per-child tax credit?

<p>

SENATOR GRAMS: Well, we have been working on it 
since 1993.  Bob Dole has made it a very important part of 
his tax package, and we have a lot of support both in the 
House and in the Senate.  So will we get it?  If Bob Dole is 
President, you can bet that that will be a part of our 
budget in 1997.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Senator, thanks for everything you 
are doing for the family.

<p>

SENATOR GRAMS: Thank you very much.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares 
more about family issues being addressed here at the 1996 
Republican National Convention. Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are watching Olympic 
heroes come out to the podium.  We are live from San Diego, 
where Washington, D.C., has been transplanted at the 
Republican National Convention, and we are reporting from 
the convention floor and talking with our special guest, 
Ambassador Alan Keyes, along with Marty Dannenfelser, who is 
leading government relations in Family Research Council.

<p>

First we have a caller. Caller, are you there?
Do you have a comment or a question? Steve, I understand.

<p>

CALLER FROM SAN PEDRO, CALIFORNIA: Right. Yes, I 
do.  First of all, I would like to thank you all very much, 
especially Ambassador Keyes, for taking this call.

<p>

I have a statement to make, then a recommendation, 
and then I am soliciting your comments.  The statement is, 
I am pro-choice, the choice being sex versus no sex, 
protected versus unprotected sex, which is then followed by 
personal consequences.

<p>

My recommendation is that if there is then a fetus 
or any other consequences, that the issue be framed in terms 
of pro-life versus pro-death.  And now I am looking for your 
comments.  Thank you.  But the pro-choice issue is sex 
versus no choice.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Ambassador, your response?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I have to say that there is a 
bumper sticker out there that I have always found a very 
good one, and it says, "I am pro-choice until after 
conception."

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And I think that that is 
exactly right. It emphasizes the fact that, unlike what 
they try to make us believe, there is an element of choice 
involved in this, but it is the element of sexual 
responsibility, and you are exercising a choice when you 
decide that, outside of marriage, you are going to engage in 
sexual activities; and if, as a consequence of that, a new 
life is coming into the world, that is not the point at 
which you get to make your choice.  That child is not a 
choice; it is an obligation.  And it does not belong to you, 
because it belongs to God, and God has determined both its 
life and its rights, and you are supposed to respect them.

<p>

And that, by the way, is not a personal statement 
of Alan Keyes; it is a statement of American public 
principle which we should respect as a people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A powerful sentiment, and one we 
haven't heard much of yet from the podium.

<p>

Theresa from Louisiana, do you have a question or 
a comment for us?

<p>

CALLER FROM SUGARTOWN, LOUISIANA: Yes. I want to 
tell Alan Keyes that I really admire him and that I agree 
with everything he says.  But I would like to hear his 
comments on this subject.

<p>

I just turned from CNN, and they were really
bashing the Republicans for Jack Kemp's flip-flop on
affirmative action and on the Prop 187 in California, and
they say that he is doing -- well, they quoted "Empower
America" as saying that he had switched on his own volition,
but they really bashed the Republicans for putting that spin 
on it, saying that he is being a good VP, and why don't they 
just admit that he is following Bob Dole's lead?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, you know, I guess I would 
have to say that it probably is of his own volition but that 
he has decided of his own volition to follow Bob Dole's 
lead, and that it is good to be honest about that.  I saw 
that headline and said, "Well, Jack is acting like a Vice 
President already," and that is exactly what he has to do, 
and he knew that when he accepted the position.

<p>

So I don't think it should come as a surprise to 
us or to anybody else.  George Bush had to do the same thing 
when he decided to accept the Vice Presidency with Ronald 
Reagan on some issues, and I think that is what it means to 
run as Vice President.  That is why you have to ponder it so 
hard before you accept that position.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Hold someone's hat and agree with them.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, the positions that Bob 
Dole and now Jack Kemp have on those two issues are 
consistent with the positions that are espoused in the 
Republican platform. So I think it is a good thing that the 
two candidates are now running in sync with the Republican 
platform.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We have a special guest standing by.
Kristin, I understand that you are down there with Senator 
James Inhofe.  Senator, thanks so much for being with us.

<p>

SENATOR INHOFE: Well, thank you. It's nice to be 
with you.  It's kind of fun here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, I'm glad to hear it.

<p>

Tell us, Senator, as you take a look at a lot of 
the discussion of unity, I am sure there is a lot of 
excitement about the tax policy.  Do you think that pro-family 
conservatives are going to have a lot to be excited about, too?

<p>

SENATOR INHOFE: Well, yes. Oh, I think they 
ought to be really excited. You know, I gave a talk today 
to a group that is sponsored by Coke Industries, a very 
large group, and by coincidence I was to be on the platform 
speaking with Jack Kemp.  That was set up before Jack Kemp 
became the nominee for Vice President.  So we had a chance 
really to talk about these things in a spirited way.

<p>

I think when you look at the tax cuts that are 
right out of the chute that Bob Dole proposed, that is very 
pro-family, you know, the $500 tax credit per child and the 
reduction in taxes, the whole idea.

<p>

I was at a town hall meeting in Sapulpa, Oklahoma,
the other day, and a gal named -- a real good friend of mine 
who came -- her name is Beverly LaHaye(?) -- she said, "You 
know, government has deprived me of my opportunity to be 
charitable."  That is what we are going to change in this 
country.

<p>

I am very excited about what is happening here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, we so appreciate your 
taking the time to be with us.

<p>

Marty, you have been working on welfare policy.
Do you think that a change will allow people the chance to 
be more charitable?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think so, and I think 
that Senator Coates earlier really touched upon it, that 
that is what we should be looking towards, is to give people 
at the local level the opportunity to do more within their 
own communities, and that is the type of charitable help 
that will really make a difference in people's lives, 
because it is much closer to home, and they know exactly 
where it came from, not from a faceless bureaucrat in 
Washington.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you see any connection, 
Ambassador Keyes, in the welfare state, where we are kind of 
dehumanizing people in a way, and the abortion mentality?  
Has there been a seepage over of our philosophy, kind of 
downgrading people?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, I think that both of them 
come, ultimately, from a failure to recognize that what 
defines human beings is their moral capacity, and I think 
that denying that moral capacity means that you set up 
programs that treat human beings as if they are ripe for 
dependency, have no initiative, can take no responsibility, 
and will not be accountable for their own lives and actions.

<p>

And so you hand them a handout, you don't ask that 
in exchange they show some respect and work and try to build 
up their lives, which, of course, is what is done at the 
charitable level by churches and by community groups where 
people work one to one and really have to deal with one 
another as human beings, showing respect for that moral 
capacity and that sense of responsibility.

<p>

And, of course, abortion rests on that same utter 
denial that we must be responsible for the consequences of 
our actions and that same radical selfishness which looks to 
someone else to bear the burden for your condition and 
situation.

<p>

In the case of the welfare state, it is some 
faceless taxpayer through some faceless bureaucrat from whom 
you get support, and in the case of abortion, it's the 
innocent life of that child that is going to be taken rather 
than having you take on the responsibility you should.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tough issues.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: But the spirit is the same in both cases.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would like to thank you so much, 
Ambassador, and so much, Marty.  We look forward to having 
both of you on <i>Straight Talk</i> again. I know our viewers 
will, too.

<p>

<i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  We 
have been coming to you live from San Diego.  Some things 
you saw on television; some things we showed you -- 
convention highlights when the Republicans were here in 
California.  The Democrats are in Chicago right now, but 
there are still more highlights, some more things that you 
didn't get to see on the networks or on some of your 
favorite programs.  So please stay tuned for more convention 
highlights from San Diego while we talk to you about what's 
going on Behind the Headlines. 

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thank you so much for taking
time out of your busy convention schedule to meet with us.

<p>

You have been here now for almost two weeks.  You 
came for the platform committee, and now we are in the 
middle of the convention.  As you evaluate the last two 
weeks, how would you describe what has happened?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, Kristi, first of all, it has 
been extraordinary to run into just literally hundreds of 
delegates that are at a Republican convention or any 
convention for the first time in their lives.  I have run 
into teachers and home-schoolers and just typical mothers 
and professional people that, over the last couple of years, 
have gotten into politics because they care about family 
issues or the sanctity-of-human-life issue.  And now here 
they are at a major party convention representing their 
states.  So that has been really exciting. 

<p>

The other thing is that these folks have 
accomplished some things here.  They have a good, 
conservative platform, because so many of them were elected 
as delegates.  I think they have had an indirect influence 
on Bob Dole's choice of a running mate.  I think the Dole 
campaign knew that they had to go with a running mate who 
was a solid conservative and also had a pro-life voting 
record. 

<p>

So I am impressed, and I think the delegates here 
ought to feel pretty good about themselves. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Again, in fact, the delegates really 
-- that story is one that confirms some things that you have 
said all along.  About 50 to 60 percent of the delegates 
describe themselves as being pro-family, pro-life 
conservatives.  Do you think that that reflects the kind of 
energy that you have seen nationwide? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: No question about it.  The real growth 
in the Republican Party all around the country is coming 
from pro-family and pro-life activists.  I mean, the 
economic issues are extremely important to the Republican 
Party, and the economic issues are also family issues in the 
sense that American families are working harder and harder 
and they are falling further and further behind on the 
treadmill.

<p>

But when you really go out around the grass roots, 
it is not so much the economic issues as it is the sense 
that there is something that has gone wrong with the 
culture, that the family has broken down -- the 1.5 million 
abortions a year that we have.  That is what is generating 
all this energy and excitement and growth in the Republican 
Party, and I hope the people at the top of the Republican 
Party understand that that is where all the new blood in the 
party is coming from. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But if you think about where we have 
come on Vice Presidential selections; I mean, rumors of 
Colin Powell and Christine Todd Whitman, and now Jack Kemp 
is the selection --

<p>

MR. BAUER: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  -- what do you think was the impact 
that a lot of these pro-family Americans had on that 
pendulum swing? 

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I actually heard through the 
grapevine that the Dole campaign did some polling of 
delegations before they got to San Diego and discovered that 
they would have a major problem on their hands at this 
convention if they had gone with a pro-abortion running mate.

<p>

So you are right; we went from a point six or 
eight weeks ago where literally almost every name on the 
list was pro-abortion and from the more liberal wing of the 
party to the point where, I think, over the last 10 days, 
even before the Kemp selection, almost every name was pro-
life and pro-family.  Whether it was Senator Nickles or 
Senator Mack of Florida, Governor Engler, or Jack Kemp, the 
ultimate choice, every trend line within the Republican 
Party is in a pro-life, pro-family direction. 

<p>

We saw it again just recently in the three Senate 
primaries in Georgia, Kansas, and Michigan.  I think we are 
going to see it this November in races all over the country.  
We saw it two years ago in the congressional races, where 
every pro-life incumbent won and no pro-life challenger lost.

<p>

So I think the trend line is pretty clear.  I am 
glad that Christine Todd Whitman and Colin Powell and 
Governor Wilson find other parts of the Republican agenda 
compelling enough that they want to be Republicans, but I 
think they are going to have to content themselves to be in 
a party that is pro-family and pro-life. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to see throughout the 
show, Gary, some of the scenes from San Diego.  But what do 
you think the untold story is that our viewers may not know 
about what has been happening here in the last two weeks? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: I think the untold story at this 
convention is the one that we have already talked about.  
There is a lot of cynicism in the media about people being 
turned off on politics, that nobody trusts the system 
anymore, and yet here there are literally several thousand 
people, most of whom are new to politics, just getting 
involved at the grassroots level. 

<p>

Time and time again, they came up to me and said, 
"I'm just starting.  This isn't a one shot for me.  I'm 
going to be in this four years from now and eight years from 
now."  That's exciting.  That's good for American democracy 
and good for America and good for the Republican Party. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, as we have gone from place to 
place throughout the convention and the platform hearing, we 
have seen crowds form, instantaneous news conferences, a 
tremendous outpouring of public support.  We are going to 
show some of that throughout the show. 

<p>

One reporter called it Christian Woodstock, 
watching the kind of reaction of people to you as you have 
come here to the platform.  What is your response to this 
incredible outpouring of really affection and interest in 
what you're doing? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, it's humbling, actually.  I 
mean, I am flattered by it and pleased by it.  But whatever 
I do in Washington, I am able to do only because I have the 
proxy of all these folks that have been coming up to us this 
week.  And so my hat goes off to them rather than them 
thinking that I am the important person in this movement.  
They are the important people, and I am just trying to speak 
for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, take a look at the next four 
years and the next eight years.  Where is the balance of 
power going to lie between the economics and the social 
issues, and how will they work together? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: I think that a Republican Party that 
will be at its peak effectiveness will be a Republican Party 
where the economic issues and the social issues are seen as 
being equal -- equal of attention, equal of energy, et 
cetera.  And when the Republican Party really finds its 
voice, not only on the need for economic reform and lower 
taxes but also on the issues of cultural renewal and the 
respect for life, then I think it's going to be an extremely 
difficult party for anyone to overcome and anybody to 
dislodge as the majority party in the United States.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to San Diego, 
California, where we are bringing you more pro-family 
highlights from the convention.  Let's take a look. 

<p>

[Clips from convention and related events follow:]

<p>

CONVENTION ATTENDEE:  Well, I think the families 
of America have a great ticket, they have a great platform, 
and now they've got a great party.  It's called the 
Republican Party. 

<p>

[Segment from Tribute to Patrick J. Buchanan,
Escondido, California, August 11, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. BUCHANAN: Friends, what are we doing to our 
own people?  During this campaign, I went down to a tiny
town in Louisiana, central Louisiana in the bayou country.
It is called Rayne, Louisiana.  I went there because I had
just heard that a Fruit of the Loom plant was shutting down.
The plant had been built in 1992.  And so I went outside 
that plant where 600 women worked, and they were bewildered, 
and some of them were crying, and they didn't know what 
happened, because the plant was brand new, and they were 
making $6 an hour, and they were told that the plant was 
being shut down and one just like it was opening up in 
Mexico.

<p>

So, you know, in Washington, the think-tank 
scholars, foundation-fed, will get up and tell you, "These 
are sunset industries, these are dead-end jobs.  Let them 
all go."  But to those women of Rayne, Louisiana, those $6-
an-hour jobs were how they were raising their kids.  They 
were the best jobs they ever had, and they are not going to 
be making computers when they lose those jobs; they're going 
to be on welfare and they're going to be on unemployment. 

<p>

Across America, company towns are becoming ghost 
towns.  Behind this surface prosperity, families are being 
uprooted, forced to move out to find new work.  Young women 
who want to stay at home with their preschool children are 
being forced into the labor market to make the money to keep 
up the family's standard of living. 

<p>

You know, I am a conservative.  I have been a 
conservative all my life.  But if preserving and protecting 
neighborhoods, families, and communities, if conservatives 
aren't doing that, what is it we conservatives are trying to 
conserve? 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Friends, either we Americans go forward together 
or we are not going forward at all.  The American people are 
crying for deliverance.  Let us join forces with men and 
women of all parties to clean up our politics.  Let's put an 
end to all corporate contributions to political parties and 
all PAC payoffs that have put America the beautiful on an 
auction block and corrupted the democratic politics of the 
greatest republic on Earth.  Let us put an end to it all, my 
friends. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We need a party that not only preaches but 
practices a conservatism of the heart, that looks out for 
all of our people, but especially for those who have no one 
else to look out for them and no one else to speak out for 
them. 

<p>

Friends, we are in the process; the job is not 
done of making the Republican Party that kind of party 
again.  When no one else dared, back in 1991, we walked off 
a little TV show and challenged the President of the United 
States.  Look how far we have come. 

<p>

Read that party platform of 1996.  Whole sections 
that stand for life, protecting our borders, immigration 
reform, economic patriotism, fair trade, equal justice under 
law, restoring America's lost sovereignty, and putting 
America first.  They are right out of the speeches of Pat 
Buchanan, speeches we have been giving for 18 months. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I know and I have heard the sentiments in this 
hall tonight, and I respect them, and I appreciate them. I
think I know they are born of love for our cause and 
affection and love for me and Shelly.

<p>

But, you know, the other night -- I have been 
thinking and praying over this, and something came to me 
from the grammar school history books of my childhood.  In 
the Middle Ages, there was something they called the Truce 
of God.  During the 40 days of Lent, the warring nobles and 
knights of the kings, they suspended their battles with one 
another, and there was no fighting during Lent.

<p>

I believe that today this disputaceous and, yes, 
divided party of ours needs such a truce, a temporary truce, 
a truce of San Diego.  Let us, at least for the next 10 
weeks, nobles and knights and even peasants with pitchforks, 
suspend our battles with one another and join together in a 
common cause to defeat Bill Clinton and Prince Albert.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to San Diego, 
California, where we are bringing you more pro-family 
highlights from the convention. 

<p>

[Segments from the convention follow:]

<p>

CONVENTION ATTENDEE:  We are really impressed.
We, of course, are very excited by the announcement that 
Jack Kemp will be on the ticket, and we think, frankly, it 
has been a shot in the arm that the Republicans have needed, 
and we're looking forward to great things as a result. 

<p>

CONVENTION ATTENDEE:  The party now has a platform 
[unintelligible] for open opportunity, low taxes, higher 
economic growth, higher standard of living. 

<p>

CONVENTION ATTENDEE:  Well, I'm excited about the 
prospects coming up in November.  I think we're going to do 
very well in the House and the Senate, and I think that 
there's now -- people are very optimistic about our chances 
of winning the White House as well. 

<p>

[Segment from Pro-Family Briefing, August 12, 1996, follows:]

<p>

AMBASSADOR ALAN KEYES: We have, I believe, to 
stand before the American people in order to represent what 
we believe to be true about the heart of this nation's 
identity.  There are issues that go to that heart, and we 
must speak to them with integrity, and we must understand 
the priorities implied by that integrity, or two things will 
be true:  first, we will not win; and second, we will not 
deserve to win.

<p>

And I know that's hard for folks to understand 
right now, because in the midst of all of the things that we 
do with victory in mind, we sometimes forget that victory is 
not our purpose.  It is the result of serving our purpose 
well.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

When I fought against the Communists during the 
course of the 1980s in the Reagan years, it was my 
understanding that one of the reasons we fought them was 
that they were people who believed that the end justified 
the means; that it did not matter what moral principles you 
violated so long as, in the end, your partisan cause, 
whether in a country or in the world, was triumphant. 

<p>

This cannot be the Republican way.  It cannot be 
the American way, or the battle we fought in the 1980s will 
be meaningless. 

<p>

Now, why have I said all of that?  I say all of it 
because it is true.  I, along with others, want and have 
worked very hard to make sure that the appeal of the 
Republican Party would be as broad as possible in terms of 
the kind of formal groupings that the media and others try 
to impose on us:  Are we going to attract enough Hispanics 
and enough blacks and enough women and enough other 
divisions to our division to make it the majority division? 

<p>

This is important, except that those groupings are 
all wrong.  In the end, human beings are not fundamentally 
divided on the basis of these superficial differences.  We 
are fundamentally divided, most importantly of all, on the 
ground of what we think is right and what we think is wrong.  
That is the true division. 

<p>

And that determines, or ought to determine, our 
priority as individuals and as a party.  If it does not, 
then our ambition has corrupted our purpose, and even if 
that ambition succeeds, the corruption will fail. 

<p>

I think that is very important here in this room.  
I presume you're here because of your commitment to the 
necessity of addressing the issues that affect our moral 
character and moral life. 

<p>

We are being told these days that that is one 
special-interest group among many.  But I don't believe it 
is, because these issues are the heart of the matter.  When 
the nation was founded, it was founded on the basis of moral 
principle. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

When we went forward in the face of the wars and 
the adversities, starting with the Revolutionary War, what 
inspired and encouraged our people was that commitment to 
moral principle, that sense that as a nation we not only 
stood for something that would be successful -- see, this is 
what everyone wanted us to believe is the optimistic view of 
the American future:  We are optimistic because we're going 
to achieve success. 

<p>

But in the end, success is an empty word unless we 
know the standard by which that success is to be measured, 
and I think that success for America has to mean what it 
meant in the beginning, that we hold these truths to be 
self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, 
and that that phrase is not just a statement of abstract 
principle; it is the definition of liberty.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And if we abandon that definition, then in the end 
our success will be no success at all. 

<p>

And the cause that brings us together, the cause 
of the family, the cause of our defense of life, these look 
like discrete causes(?), but they're not.  In the end, there 
is only one principle at work here:  either we accept that 
first definition of our liberty, which sees it as a gift 
from the hand of God dependent on our respect for His 
authority, His will, His standards, His law, or we do not. 

<p>

And I think that for all the polls -- I see polls.
This morning I was reading a poll about abortion, and the 
footnote in the USA Today thing was, you know, the vote 5 to 
4 in the Casey(?) decision seems to have achieved what all 
of these parties cannot.  It has gotten to the position 
where the majority of the American people are, according to 
our poll, and that is a position that is a little bit this 
way and a little bit that way about abortion, doesn't treat 
it as an issue of principle.

<p>

But haven't we in our history learned that there 
are certain issues that do not depend on majority vote, that 
there are certain issues that cannot depend on majority 
rule?  And was it not the wisdom of the founder of the 
Republican Party that there are times in history when you 
must stand for those principles regardless of what may seem 
to be the majority opinion, because the purpose of 
leadership is not merely to be the puppet of every majority 
whim; it is, rather, to be the representatives of those 
principles by virtue of which the majority assumes the right 
to rule, by virtue of which every individual assumes the 
right to demand respect for their vote and for their consent.

<p>

And the principles that we champion and defend in 
the cause of the unborn are not only the principles of 
respect for innocent life in every particular case; they are 
the principles of respect for that truth that the source of 
human rights is not a human decision.  It is not the 
mother's choice; it is not the Constitution's words; it is 
not the Supreme Court's decision.  The source of human 
rights is a will beyond our will, a choice beyond our 
choice, and we must respect that or lose all sense of right.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Everything else we do, by the way, flows from 
that.  That includes our economic agenda.  When people stand 
in front of us as they sometimes try to do and they say, 
"Well, you've got fiscal conservatives and moral 
conservatives; they're at odds with each other."  Not in 
principle, because if I believe that by respecting So-and-So's 
right to control his $100,000, I am going to have to 
conclude that they have the right to own slaves and build 
death camps, is that understanding of individual rights 
accepted? 

<p>

See, we are not a party that believes in the 
untrammeled promotion of selfish interests.  We are 
committed to respect for individual rights because we 
believe in the capacity of human beings for moral choice and 
moral responsibility. 

<p>

And, therefore, we must be committed to doing 
those things and sustaining those things that build up that 
capacity for moral responsibility.  An educational system 
that understands that the ground of decent education is 
motivated and grounded in morality, and an economic system 
that understands that the ground of risk-taking and 
initiative and all of the things that are needed to sustain 
the free enterprise system we are dedicated to is a moral 
character capable of self-discipline and self-control and an 
individual will that acknowledges that there are limits to 
individual choice that come first in our responsibilities 
toward our children, toward our spouse, toward our 
community. 

<p>

This, I know, is what we all profess to believe.  
I hear it all the time.  During the course of my little 
campaign, even now as I walk the halls of this convention, 
everyone acknowledges this is what we believe. 

<p>

You will not hear this articulated from the podium 
at this convention, because the connection between our 
economic hopes and our moral identity is being denied here.  
But it is the truth of our Republican creed.  And regardless 
of what the consequences are for the moment, those who truly 
believe in that creed will have to stand for it, come what 
may. 

<p>

I am put in mind of the fact that Ronald Reagan 
spent 20 years in the American political wilderness 
championing what was right before, in the 1980 election, he 
finally was able to achieve success.  He stored up all that 
integrity so that, at a moment of our great international 
crisis, it would be there in reserve. 

<p>

Some of us still have to store up the integrity of 
this nation's truth, and in the moment of our real crisis, 
which is coming, which has come, it will be there in reserve.

<p>

GOP convention in just a moment.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to a look at more pro-family 
highlights from San Diego, California, and <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

[Segment from Republican National Coalition for 
Life's "A Whale of a Party," August 13, 1996, follows:] 

<p>

MR. BAUER:  For millions of Americans, life is not 
about judicial decisions and executive decrees in 
Washington.  It's helping hands and good neighbors.  It's 
nighttime prayers and lovingly packed lunch boxes.  It's 
hard work and a little put away for the future. 

<p>

Those are the things you believed in.  Those are 
the things the American people, even in 1996, believe in.
Fight for those things.  Teach your children about those
things.  And if you do that, we will have this meeting again 
on the floor of the Republican convention in the year 2000. 

<p>

God bless you all.  Thank you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MRS. BEVERLY LA HAYE:  You know, we're really the 
pro-life world right here.  You are the men and women of 
America that really count and will make a difference.  We 
dare not let our voice be silent; we must speak out. 

<p>

PARTICIPANT: -- three leaders who have brought 
the pro-life cause to the national audience through the 
Presidential debates. 

<p>

MR. BUCHANAN:  The platform of the Republican 
Party reflects the views and values of right to life all the 
way, and that's our victory.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES:  I believe that it is essential, 
given the evil that we fight, that we come together and 
unite, dwelling not so much upon our failings, our foibles, 
our inadequacies, as upon the fact that however hard the 
journey was, however great the temptations may have been, 
the Republican Party at this convention has reached the 
right conclusion, we have made the right choices, and we go 
forward now to represent once again the right alternatives 
for this great nation. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE DORNAN:  All of you remember 
Clinton, on the disgraceful day, 20th anniversary of Roe v. 
Wade, Phyllis and I and some of you and Gary Bauer were all 
out on the Ellipse.  He looks through the window at us and 
signs five executive orders, death orders, what Billy Graham 
and the Pope and Mother Teresa called the culture of death, 
five executive death orders:  RU 486, human pesticide; what 
Chris fights on, the Chiro(?) policy crushing the Mexico 
City policy.  It went on and on.

<p>

One has been reversed; four to go.  The one that 
is reversed, with your help, with Chris speaking on the 
floor with me, and Henry, no abortions in military 
hospitals. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I won it last year.  I held the line this year.
One down, four to go.  God bless you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE DORNAN: Here we are.  That's 
pretty good.  Hey, William, look up here, buddy.  Come on,
Molly, look around here.  There we are.  Here's all my gang.
This is why I'm for life.  Any questions?  There it is. 

<p>

[Segment from Christian Coalition's Faith and 
Freedom Celebration, August 14, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. RALPH REED:  We are to proclaim loud and clear 
that this country was made great not by taxing and spending 
bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., but by faith in God and the 
traditional family. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And in case you haven't heard it from the podium 
the last two days, let me say it so that there can be no 
doubt:  the Republican Party is a pro-life party, and as 
long as we're here, it always will be. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We are inclusive.  We are open.  We exclude no 
one.  But lest there be any doubt, we will never walk away 
from the innocent sanctity of human life in the mother's womb.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I have in my hand your 1996 Republican platform.  
There have been some this week that have said they haven't 
read the platform yet.  I don't intend on reading the whole 
thing this morning, but let me just go through a few of the 
things that are in here that this ticket and this party 
stand for. 

<p>

First of all, this platform calls for a human life 
amendment to protect all innocent human life:  born, aged, 
disabled, infirm, and elderly.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It calls for a constitutional amendment to ensure 
that every single child in America has the same right that 
every member of Congress and every member of the Supreme 
Court has, and that is to be able to bow their head and 
begin their day with prayer in the public schools. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It calls for a massive, $500-per-child tax cut, 
the largest tax cut in history directed at the family, to 
strengthen the most successful department of health, 
education, and welfare ever conceived, and that's the two-parent, 
intact family. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It calls for returning control of education to 
parents and families, where it belongs, and abolishing 
outcome-based education, Goals 2000, and the Department of 
Education. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And it calls for not one more dime to go to 
Planned Parenthood to use our tax dollars to take the lives 
of unborn children. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

You know, to those who say that religious 
conservatives are an albatross hanging around the neck of 
the Republican Party, let me remind them of something.  This 
party was founded not simply to balance the budget, not 
simply to cut taxes.  It is not just a party of accountants.
This party, unique among all political parties in the 
history of Western civilization, was founded to right a 
wrong, to combat an evil, and to remove the stain of the sin 
of slavery from this land.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And just as it once stood for those who had been 
left behind who were of a different color and a different 
ethnic background, today it must stand for other 
marginalized people:  it must stand for the unborn; it must 
stand for the minority adolescent in the inner city who is 
walking through a metal detector into a school that is a war 
zone.  We must be a voice for the voiceless and a defender 
for the defenseless.  That's our mission. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  More pro-family highlights coming up 
in just a moment.  Please keep watching. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segment from U.S. Taxpayers Party National 
Convention Platform Hearing, August 15, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I want to start by just reading some 
copy that the Family Research Council had in an ad that we 
ran in the <i>Washington Post</i> about the Defense of Marriage 
Act.

<p>

As you know, in Hawaii, the Hawaii court could 
rule that a marriage of two men or two women is a marriage, 
and we have been very aggressive in fighting this.  This is 
the way that we began our conversation on the issue: 

<p>

"The institution of marriage was built to last.
It was made in heaven, recognized by the state, sanctioned 
by faith, and honored by the community.  It has gone hand in 
hand with the rise of civilization.  Marriage has survived 
Marxism, outlasted free love, outlived Woodstock, toughed 
out the Playboy philosophy, and even endured radical 
feminism." 

<p>

As one of six children from a large and boisterous 
extended family, I understand that family is more than a 
word.  You know, it's joyful; it's a great experience.  But 
it is concrete. 

<p>

Family is that unit which is bound by marriage, by 
blood, by birth, and by adoption.  It is not a fill-in-the-blank 
phenomenon.  It is not something that we define based 
on the way that we feel today and not tomorrow.  It is a 
firm foundation for raising the next generation, and it is 
specific, concrete, and has long-lasting benefits. 

<p>

The reason why our government recognizes family is 
not because the founding fathers were a well-organized 
interest group and were very effective in institutionalizing 
their world view until, thank God, you know, the homosexuals 
of log cabin came along to enlighten us, and I say that 
facetiously, of course. 

<p>

Family has created the world in which we all 
survive.  In the same way in which water is a bond of 
hydrogen and oxygen, and it creates something that has a 
unique and specific life-giving value to everyone, marriage 
is the union of a man and a woman.  And if we call every 
fluid water, that does not mean that everything you drink is 
going to have the same benefit.  And if we call every 
relationship marriage, we do not create the same foundation 
for our children, and we can bring the same poison into our 
society by pretending that all things are created equal if 
we pretend that they are.  Marriage is specific. 

<p>

That is one of the things that we're fighting and 
one of the things that we have to actually worry about 
today.  I marvel at the fact that in my 10 years in 
Washington, we go from talking about whether or not we 
should do more for the family to whether we even know what 
family is at all, and that we actually have to fight this.  
It's a chilling circumstance today. 

<p>

The Family Research Council was created to be a 
voice for the family at the federal level, and I presented 
to the Taxpayers Committee a whole family catalog of 25 
platform positions.  But I just want to kind of go through 
some touch points on things that we consider critically 
important at the Family Research Council. 

<p>

The American family is in crisis, and government 
cannot solve all the crises of the family.  But it can take 
positive steps to restore the integrity of the family and 
its vitality.  We can oppose the marriage penalty in which 
it is more financially profitable for us to live together 
rather than to marry, and under the Clinton Administration, 
that marriage penalty has increased. 

<p>

It is an overtaxed family that we are seeing 
today, and we have commended the 104th Congress for 
supporting a $500-per-child tax credit.  In fact, if the tax 
credit per child had kept pace with inflation, rather than 
the $2,500 that you have today, it would be about $9,200.  
And, ironically, when Bill Clinton was a governor, he was 
part of a national family coalition that said, Gee, we need 
a $1,000 tax credit; and the $500 one is still hard-fought 
and not yet won. 

<p>

Forty years ago, the average American family spent 
one in 50 dollars in taxes.  Today it is one in four.  And 
the second earner in a family, normally it covers about 30 
percent of the overall budget, which is exactly the kind of 
income that Uncle Sam is taking home.  We have a nation 
today in which one member of the family works for the 
government and one member of the family works to support the 
family.  And that's pathetic.  That's absolutely pathetic. 

<p>

We are not talking about women who say that they 
want to work or women who have -- I am sure we all remember 
that the Proverbs 31 woman had a thriving real estate 
business and was managing to trade with the merchant ships.  
You know, it is not a matter of saying we think that women 
should not be involved in their community.  What we are 
saying is that, statistically speaking, the vast majority of 
women would prefer to stay home when their children are 
young and cannot afford it because Uncle Sam has a voracious 
appetite for their funds, and we need to cut him off.  He 
needs to get a job. 

<p>

[Laughter and applause.]

<p>

One of the places that we can turn to on that 
front is welfare.  We believe that the failure to form 
stable families is at the heart of the welfare crisis, and 
we have in fact instituted a system which pays you not to 
name the father of your child, not to marry the father of 
your child, not to save any money, and not to work.  And if 
you manage to do these four things, yes, there's a raise in 
it for you.  And if you have another child, more money is on 
the way. 

<p>

We have created a series of disincentives that is 
destroying people, and I know that is not news to you.  The 
Family Research Council, among the policy that is supported, 
has been in favor of the family cap, and a lot of people 
have talked about this as a cruel thing.  But let us be 
honest.  We have created an incentive for you not to marry 
and for you to have more children as the best way to ensure 
that you see a raise in your income. 

<p>

My husband and I, as we contemplate our own 
family, know full well that, much as Family Research 
Council, I am sure, loves me, I don't think Gary is going to 
give me a raise every time I have a new child. 

<p>

Every family has to make its own decisions, and 
that is the strengthening process of family, people working 
together to survive, and we have destroyed families by 
pretending like certain of us are so inept or so incapable 
or must be spoken down to in such a way that we will believe 
little of them but that they bear more children, that they 
have no self-control and no capability, when in fact they 
are very intelligent people.  They are making the only 
decision available to them in which their income is 
automatically guaranteed to go up. 

<p>

And so we see that welfare reform is key.  But the 
most important kind of welfare reform is that which gets the 
community involved with people. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We have to make our programs community-centered, 
church-centered, private initiative-centered.  We have to 
provide tax credits for those kinds of programs.  We can't 
be afraid to acknowledge that the most successful drug 
treatment programs are faith-based, that the most successful 
child care programs are faith-based, that the most 
successful alcohol programs are faith-based, that the best 
way to deal with out-of-wedlock pregnancy is faith-based. 

<p>

And instead, once again, we have a tremendous 
disincentive in our tax structure.  We're not going to help 
the people that are doing the job.  And you may have seen it 
in Texas.  There has been a lot of controversy over a drug 
program that actually works and got some money, some federal 
monies, and a very secular humanist set of lawyers went 
after them to take that money away because they actually 
mention God.  They actually mention God in the treatment of 
drug abuse. 

<p>

So, apparently, it's all right for us to have 
recidivism that leaves people dying in the streets, and it's 
not okay for us to get the community engaged in ways that we 
know will work. 

<p>

Welfare spending has increased from $57.6 billion 
in 1960 to $400 billion today.  We have gone during that 
period from 5.3 percent in out-of-wedlock births to 30.1 
percent in out-of-wedlock births.  We have gone from 22 
percent among African-Americans to 68.1 percent. 

<p>

You know, I believe frankly, I don't think we are 
hard-hearted, green-eyeshade people here -- I mean, I don't 
think anybody would have problems with a welfare state that 
was successful.  This is not a monetary discussion.  This is 
about true compassion.  And we are ruining people's lives 
with our federal dollars because we refuse to do the things 
that help them. 

<p>

We are not experimenting with "wedfare," in which 
we help people establish homes.  We are not allowing the 
church to get involved in matters of broken lives.  And 
isn't that what the church is for? 

<p>

Our goal has to be effective compassion and to get 
Uncle Sam out of the job as being the gluttonous middle-man.
On the critical moral issues of our day, we have got to have
the church involved in helping to solve our problems. 

<p>

But let us be clear that all of these programs and 
all of the tax benefits that we could think of are 
meaningless if we do not have life itself.  We hold these 
truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal 
and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable rights, and among those are life. 

<p>

We have got to appreciate the fact that we as a 
nation are funding, to the tune of some $245 million, the 
efforts of Planned Parenthood.  We are funding in the 
millions of dollars the U.N. conferences on the woman and on 
the child.  And we are spending millions and millions of 
dollars on condom handouts. 

<p>

I found it very ironic that my Federal Government 
made dancing condom ads.  I mean, at the very least, if 
you're going to allow such tasteless things to take place, 
can't they make them themselves?  Why am I forced to make 
these kinds of ridiculous and immoral ads and then pay for 
the air time to run them?  We are funding immorality. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Last week, we brought you some convention highlights,
Republican GOP convention highlights, from San Diego.  But 
there were a lot of pro-family events we didn't get a chance 
to show you, so please stay tuned for more convention 
highlights while we talk to you about what's going on Behind 
the Headlines.

<p>

[Segment from behind the scenes at the Republican National 
Convention follows:]

<p>

INTERVIEWER: This is Gary Bauer, president of the 
Family Research Council.  Mr. Bauer, first of all, I guess, 
a comment on everything preceding the convention.  We're 
kind of rolling, we're kind of all on one page, it seems 
like, but are you satisfied with what happened in the
platform hearings?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think a broadly conservative 
message is emerging from the convention.  Certainly the 
platform is a Reaganesque platform:  low taxes, small 
government, family values, respect for life.  Those are the 
key issues that I think we can get 51 percent of the 
American people to rally around.  It's what worked for 
Ronald Reagan, and if Bob Dole and Jack Kemp run on that 
platform, I think we'll have a real competitive race.

<p>

INTERVIEWER: Are you convinced that they will run 
on that platform?  Are you convinced that they will take the 
social issues to the people?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I'm hoping that they'll spend a 
lot of time at this convention actually getting to meet 
real-live delegates and finding out what they think, instead 
of listening to all those high-paid Washington consultants 
that often tell politicians what they're supposed to do.

<p>

I think Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are both bright
men.  I certainly think they understand -- I hope they do --
that this is a new Republican Party that believes in family
values, and I think if they spend some time with these
delegates, they will realize that that's the ticket for this
campaign and those are the issues they ought to emphasize,
along with economic growth and lower taxes.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * </center>

<p>

[Segments from FRC booth area of convention follow:]

<p>

GENTLEMAN: Thank you. Appreciate everything 
you're doing for the country.  Take care.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Good to 
meet you both.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER: . . . the party of Lincoln ought to be 
arguing for the protections of our Constitution for our 
unborn children.  That seems to me to be a good and right 
thing to do, even if occasionally the polls may show that 
most Americans are either confused about the issues or can't 
make up their minds.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

INTERVIEWER: Speaking of Dole, he had some 
critical remarks about you not too long back.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Right.

<p>

INTERVIEWER: How's the situation now?  Have you 
spoken with him since that time?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Only through intermediaries.  You 
know, Bob Dole is an opinionated guy, and so am I, and it's 
not unusual in Washington that you occasionally get into the 
ring with somebody and spar a little bit.  But at the end of 
the day, I think it's going to be a pretty united team, and 
I certainly don't have any ill will.

<p>

INTERVIEWER: Dole's selection of Kemp.  Your comments about that?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, Jack's a personal friend of 
mine.  His daughter worked for me at the White House, so I 
guess I'm a little biased.  But he had a solid pro-life 
voting record when he was in Congress.  He brings the ticket 
some needed energy and optimism.

<p>

I suppose he is probably the biggest, most natural 
heir to the Reagan legacy.  So I think it's going to help a 
lot.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER [upon autographing a copy of his book, 
Our Hopes, Our Dreams]:  I hope they enjoy it.

<p>

GENTLEMAN:  They will.  Thanks a lot.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  It was really good to meet you.

<p>

GENTLEMAN:  Nice meeting you.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Thank you.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

GENTLEMAN:  . . . and our eight-year-old son says, 
"Because of our values."

<p>

MR. BAUER: Fantastic.  You're obviously already 
doing something real right at home.  That's fantastic.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

GENTLEMAN:  I think everybody will be leaving San 
Diego at the end of this week with a whole new situation.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

LADY:  . . . I really like Jack Kemp.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  He's a good man.

<p>

LADY:  Yes.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  He's a good man.

<p>

LADY:  He is.  Thank you very much.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  A lot of enthusiasm, which the ticket 
really needed.

<p>

LADY:  I know.  It really did.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  It's good to meet you, Gerri.

<p>

LADY:  Nice meeting you.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER [autographing his book]:  You said Richard?

<p>

GENTLEMAN: Richard.

<p>

LADY:  . . . really appreciate the fact that 
you're able to succinctly articulate the things we believe 
in.  It takes me half an hour to say what I want to say, and 
you say it so well.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We'll be right back with more 
convention highlights here from San Diego, California.
Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to San Diego, 
California, where we're bringing you some pro-family 
highlights of the GOP convention.  Let's take a look.

<p>

[Segment from Pro-Family Briefing held August 12, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. BAUER:  You know, for most American families, 
life isn't about executive decisions in Washington or 
judicial decrees and all the things in the headlines.  It's 
helping hands and good neighbors.  It's nighttime prayers 
and lovingly packed lunch boxes.  It's hard work and a 
little put away for the future.

<p>

This platform understands those things and stands 
for those things.  First of all, the platform has a solid 
commitment to economic growth and to economic opportunity.  
The platform writers understood that no American family has 
ever been held up by pulling another American family down.  
The platform writers knew that the idea is not to make the 
rich poor but to give the poor opportunity to accomplish 
everything that they can.

<p>

It calls for significant tax cuts across the board 
for all Americans.  It has specific tax cuts for American 
families with children.  Those are key points of differences 
between this ticket and the White House, and I think it will 
be a difference that will loom very large in this 
Presidential race.

<p>

The second key area in the platform is education 
reform.  The platform begins with the knowledge that parents 
are the first and most important teachers that a child has. 
It calls for a cutting back of the educational bureaucracy 
so that more of the money that the taxpayers give can get to 
the teachers and the children for whom it was intended.  And 
it makes a strong statement for educational choice so that 
all parents, not just suburban parents and well-off parents 
but inner city parents, can choose the schools they send 
their children to.

<p>

A third important area is the area of cultural 
renewal.  My hat goes off to Bob Dole for having the 
courage, in the last year or so, to take the message of 
cultural renewal to Hollywood and to say what all the 
American people instinctively know; that is that our culture 
in recent years has become debased, has emphasized violence 
and sexual exploitation, and that that culture is having an 
impact on our children.

<p>

Too many American families feel today as if they 
are surrounded by hostile territory, and this platform calls 
for a reinstitution of the idea of shame so that men and 
women that are making a fast buck, whether it's in Hollywood 
or Madison Avenue, will recognize their responsibilities as 
citizens to create a culture that is family-friendly.

<p>

And finally, this platform is, without shame or 
embarrassment, pro-life, and it should be, since this is the 
party of Abraham Lincoln.  Over 100 years ago, this party 
argued to the American people that the most defenseless 
members of our society then, African-American slaves, 
deserved the full protection and promise of our Declaration 
of Independence and Constitution; that they were in fact 
included in the words that said, "all men are created 
equal."

<p>

Today and over the last 20 years, the Republican 
Party has stood for the sanctity of human life, for the fact 
that today the most defenseless among us, our unborn 
children, are in fact included in those words, "all men are 
created equal."

<p>

I believe this platform is a noble and good 
platform, that it can inspire the American people to listen 
to the angels, the better angels of their nature, and I 
believe that if Bob Dole and Jack Kemp run on it, that we 
will all be at their inauguration in January 1997.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

SENATOR DON NICKLES: I want to thank everybody 
for their help, and I saw my friend Gary Bauer just spoke, 
and let me just say what a delight it has been to know and 
work with Gary and Family Research Council and other friends 
on really trying to help protect America's families.

<p>

I have heard lately Bill Clinton is talking about 
family values. I thought, well, wait a minute, is that Bill 
Bennett or is that Dan Quayle?  No, it's Bill Clinton.  One 
story did a kind of analysis that talked about the number of 
times he said "family values" and so on.  He mentions it now 
in his speeches. He knows it sells.

<p>

But, folks, you have to look to the facts.  Look 
at the history.  What about family values?  Bill Clinton's 
record doesn't comport with real family values.

<p>

You say, "What do you mean by that?"  Well, 
families are concerned about drug use.  And you look at the 
White House; they've been AWOL in the war on drugs, totally 
AWOL.  President Clinton takes off, he cuts off drug 
enforcement in the White House 80 percent.  Eighty percent. 
Makes jokes about, "Oh, well, yeah, I used -- well, I 
didn't break the drug laws of this country -- I did that in 
England -- and then I didn't inhale," and all this kind of 
cavalier attitude on drugs, and then we find out just 
recently, due to the fact that a couple of the FBI agents 
that were in charge of background investigations, that 
several people in the White House had used drugs fairly 
recently, some maybe as late as on inaugural day.

<p>

And yet this administration continues to push -- 
maybe that's the reason it took them so long.  They had over 
100 people that were a year late in having their FBI 
clearances done.

<p>

And then what did they do?  Well, they pulled out 
900 files of people who worked on cases years before in the 
Bush Administration, some even going back to the Reagan 
Administration, and they pulled out their files.  Why did 
they want to clear those files instead of the people that 
were working in the White House?  Those people had no reason 
whatsoever to be going into the White House, and this was 
for access purposes.  That's a real abuse of power.

<p>

And then you get into a real issue, too, and that 
is of character.  Who is telling the truth?  It bothers me. 
Mack McLarty -- I think very highly of the former chief of 
staff in the White House.  He said as recently, I think, or 
it just became public about eight or nine days ago that he 
was pressured into firing people in the travel office.

<p>

I remember David Watkins had a memo we found some 
time ago that said something about there would be hell to 
pay from Mrs. Clinton if they weren't fired.  Well, 
Mrs. Clinton said she didn't have anything to do with it.

<p>

Wait a minute. Truthfulness is an important 
family value. Family values are important.  Integrity is 
important. When you find people, either the President or 
Mrs. Clinton, not telling the truth, I think that undercuts 
family values. I think there is a real problem there, and 
we have seen scandal after scandal, almost a scandal a week, 
from this administration.  That undermines family values.  
That undermines discipline.

<p>

And then you look at some of the appointments this 
administration has, when they are talking about family 
values, and I remember leading the fight in the Senate 
against Dr. Elders, the surgeon general.  You know, if you 
believe in family values and then you look -- and no one can 
say that President Clinton didn't know Dr. Elders, because 
she came from Arkansas.  He appointed her originally in 
Arkansas, and then she was making comments, "Well, maybe we 
should legalize drugs."  He didn't fire her for that 
statement.  She made it once and then she made it again.  He 
didn't fire her again.  Finally he did fire her because she 
started talking about other things maybe even worse about 
what we should teach in school, and I didn't want Dr. Elders 
-- you know, she had one comment, "Well, we teach kids what 
to do in the front seat; maybe the government should teach 
them what to do in the back seat."  I don't want Dr. Elders 
teaching my kids what to do in the back seat.

<p>

But that's the kind of family values, and federal 
judges and so on, that you see that this administration has 
put in.  So their new allegiance to family values is 
rhetoric because some poster said we need to talk about 
this.  But it's not where their heart is.  It's not where 
they have been governing.

<p>

As a matter of fact, they don't have a surgeon 
general today.  They tried another one who was advocating 
abortion or had involvement in abortion, had actually 
performed them and so on -- he couldn't decide if it was one 
or 49 or 100 or what -- and so, well, now they just don't 
have one because they know it would be another hotly 
contested issue, my point being family issues are vitally 
important.  Families are the best level of government.  We 
need to protect the family structure.  We realize that when 
kids don't have two parents that those kids have a lot 
higher tendency to end up in trouble or on drugs or in 
broken families or maybe even in jail.  And so we owe it to 
America's society to protect American families, but this 
administration has almost declared war on families.

<p>

There is only one group that is really radical on 
abortion, and it's President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton, and the 
Democrats.  They are the ones that vetoed a bill that 
passed, a bipartisan bill, overwhelming majority, that would 
have banned partial-birth abortion.  It's as close to 
infanticide as anything you'll ever find, and an 
overwhelming majority in both the House and the Senate said, 
let's stop it.  Let's stop it.  It is about the only bill, I 
think, I have ever voted that would actually ban some 
abortions, and this President vetoed it, and he was wrong.

<p>

This President, too, has made a lot of statements.
He is the one that is in favor of funding abortions,
funding the termination -- funding and actually subsidizing 
the termination of innocent, unborn human beings. The 
Republican Party and most Republicans say we don't think we 
should subsidize; we don't think taxpayers should have to 
pay for that type of activity.

<p>

So there is a big difference, and people should be 
aware of it, and I am very proud of the fact that our party 
and the American people are saying, we want to stand and 
protect the lives of innocent children.

<p>

Some people say, "Is that banning all abortion?"  
No, it doesn't to do that.  We just don't think the Federal 
Government should pay for it, and we feel pretty strongly, 
and we think the American people, by an overwhelming 
majority, 80 percent or more, agree with us on that issue.

<p>

We also think states should be able to have the 
right to pass laws such as parental notification or parental 
consent, and this administration doesn't agree with that, 
either, and they happen to be wrong.

<p>

So I just want to compliment you for your efforts. 
I thank you for your efforts.  Let's work very, very hard 
and have a great victory in November.  Thank you very much.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: More convention highlights coming up 
in just a moment.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to a look at the things 
you couldn't see on network television.  Let's take a look.

<p>

[Segment from National Federation of Republican 
Women's Salute to Elizabeth Dole follows:]

<p>

SENATOR DOLE:  . . . and I would just take a 
moment just to share a few memories that made a difference 
in my life.  It was the day we met.  It was on Tuesday, 
March 14, 1972.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Now, I am not one for horoscopes, but I brought 
the one along (from) that morning.  It's turning a little 
yellow, but otherwise it's all right.  And the horoscope 
said, and I quote:  "Find the right solution to governmental 
and other problems that face you."  End of quote.

<p>

[Laughter and applause.]

<p>

Well, at 11 o'clock that morning, the solution 
walked into my office.

<p>

[Laughter and extended applause.]

<p>

She was there with her boss, a great lady, 
Virginia Knauer, who had been alluded to before, for a 
meeting on consumer issues.

<p>

Now, normally, I don't like meetings -- normally.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But this was a pretty good meeting.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

It was so good, we're still meeting 24 years later.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I don't think Elizabeth knows this.  You don't 
surprise her very often, but I do have a little surprise for 
you, Elizabeth.  I initiated a search through the Senate 
archives last week and located the schedule for that week we 
met in 1972, and I brought it with me.  It says right here, 
"Eleven o'clock, Mrs. Virginia Knauer, appointment in Senate 
office.  If I have any questions, call Nora Joel(?), 
secretary, 456-2645."  I didn't have any questions before 
the meeting, but I had a number after the meeting.

<p>

[Laughter and extended applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. BIZELL:  My name is Lisa Bizell, and I am 
somebody because of Elizabeth Hanford Dole and the Mary 
Cathy(?) Hanford Fund.  The Mary Cathy Hanford Fund was 
started by Mrs. Dole and her brother, John Hanford, as a way 
to honor their mother on her 90th birthday.  The fund has 
sponsored the Youth in Action group at the Elizabeth Hanford 
Dole Chapter of the American Red Cross in Salisbury, North 
Carolina, Mrs. Dole's home town.

<p>

Youth in Action is a program that helps teens 
develop self-esteem and learn more important skills like 
first aid, CPR, and HIV and AIDS prevention.  We also learn 
the importance of volunteering in our community.

<p>

I have been a part of Youth in Action for three 
years.  Everyone, like my family, my friends, and my 
teachers have said that being in Youth in Action has changed 
me, and I know that's true.  The things I've learned and the 
experiences I've had in Youth in Action changed my attitude, 
my willingness to accept responsibility, and my ability to 
work with others.  I have never been around so many people 
who really cared about what happens to me and my future.  
Thanks to those people, I am planning to continue my 
education by going to college.  Some day I hope to become a 
coach and teacher so I can help young people just as I have 
been helped.

<p>

I don't think Mrs. Dole realizes how many young 
people she has inspired.  All of us in Youth in Action look 
up to her, not because of the government positions she has 
held or the important people she knows but because of how 
she has shown that she cares about us.

<p>

Thank you, Mrs. Dole, for the difference you have 
made in my life and the lives of so many other young people, 
and you are the first lady to us.

<p>

ROBIN DOLE: . . . and just as Dad and Elizabeth's 
love has grown stronger throughout their marriage, so, too, 
has my friendship with Elizabeth.  I will always remember 
the first Mother's Day after they were married.  I dropped 
by with a bouquet of flowers for Elizabeth, and her eyes 
filled with tears as she realized the special role she would 
play in my life.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Elizabeth, you are very special to me.  I am proud 
to call you my stepmother and my friend, and it is my great 
honor to introduce to all of you the next First Lady of the 
United States of America, Elizabeth Dole.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MRS. DOLE:  Oh, my.  Thank you so much, and Robin, 
thank you so much for your beautiful, beautiful 
introduction.  That really touched my heart.  In fact, the 
whole program has been incredible.  I sat there with tears 
welling in my eyes, and this is just a day that I will 
cherish the rest of my life.  I don't deserve it, but I 
certainly appreciate it very, very much, everything that has 
been said and done today.  Bless you all.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

In speaking of women and opportunities for women, 
I recall especially at the Department of Transportation, 
when I was very new as Secretary, and I must tell you it is 
sort of male bastion, you know, because you are involved in 
highway construction and shipbuilding and air traffic 
control, and I said, "How many women do we have at the 
Department of Transportation?"  And they said, "Nineteen 
percent are female."

<p>

And I said -- now, this is 1983 -- I said, "When 
the Department was established in 1967, how many women were 
there?"  Do you know what the answer was?  Eighteen and a 
half percent.  We had come up half a percentage point from 
1967 to 1983.

<p>

So we decided to set up a program to help women 
enter the field, move up the ladder, and receive 
opportunities in this important area of transportation, 
because, frankly, a lot of the higher paying jobs in the 
private sector are in this area.

<p>

So Jenna(?) was the one who helped put the program 
together, and it may not sound like a lot.  We got the 
percentage up four percentage points while we were there.  
But when you have 100,000 people in your work force, that's 
a lot of women, so we were kind of proud of that record.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I knew we were making progress when a pilot told 
me one day, he said, "Mrs. Dole, the strangest thing 
happened.  I was flying into a major city, and there were 
three different voices on the air traffic control system, 
and all three were female."  And I said, "Right!  The 
program is working!"

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: More pro-family highlights from the 
GOP convention in just a moment.  Please stay tuned.

[Segment from Christian Coalition's Faith and 
Freedom Celebration held August 14, 1996, follows:]

<p>

VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE: Do you remember several 
years ago, like 1992, where I made a speech about the 
American family and where I talked about too many of our 
children were being born into fatherless homes?  Bill 
Clinton said that my speech about the family and family 
values was divisive.  Well, today he gives that speech.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And, friends, it shows, if you have the courage of 
your convictions, if you're willing to stand firm for 
principle, if you're willing to stay in the kitchen and take 
the heat, if you're willing to stand up for the family and 
stand up for what is right, we will prevail.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CAPT. SCOTT O'GRADY:  I will have to tell you what 
Scott O'Grady thinks a hero is.  A hero is somebody who 
helps somebody else.  The only thing I was doing was 
surviving, saving myself.  But I'll let you in on something. 
It doesn't take a 19-year-old Marine to go out there under 
hostile fire to save somebody's life to be considered a 
hero.  Every single person here in America can be a hero 
when you help somebody else.

<p>

The reward doesn't come from being recognized.  It 
should come from within, knowing that you did the right 
thing.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE J.C. WATTS:  Let me tell you 
something.  There is nothing more in all the world that I 
enjoy and appreciate talking about more, and that is my 
faith and my relationship with the true and the living God.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And, friends, let me tell you something.  I don't 
apologize for it.  I don't apologize for it if I'm in the 
halls of Congress.  I don't apologize if I'm on the football 
field, on the basketball court.  I don't apologize for it.

<p>

Back in 1994, when I decided that I was going to 
run for Congress, a guy called me from Washington, D.C., a 
reporter, and he asked me, and he talked to me about a lot 
of different things, and he finally, after about 30 minutes, 
got around to asking me the $64,000 question.

<p>

He asked me, he said, "Well, Commissioner" -- I 
was a corporation commissioner at the time -- he said, 
"Commissioner, let me ask you, are you going to accept the 
help from the radical Christian right in your party?"

<p>

I said, "Sir, since you put it like that, I'm a 
Baptist minister, so I am the radical Christian right in my 
party."

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It's so amazing to me that you would think that 
the society wants the Christian community, the faith 
community, to just kind of stand on the sidelines and 
twiddle their thumbs while the nation goes to pot.  I say 
no.  We've got a role to play in this country.  We love our 
country just as much as anyone else.  And I say, Keep your 
chin up.  You fight the good fight, accept the challenge to 
go out and be the very best that we can be and sustain the 
greatness of being the greatest, the freest, most 
prosperous, most wonderful country on the face of the Earth.

<p>

God bless you, and let's go get 'em on November 5. 
Thank you very much.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

REV. PAT ROBERTSON:  . . . but we're not going to 
rest until the time comes when, once again, we are proud of 
the occupant of the White House and not ashamed.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And we're not going to rest until once again 
America is that bright, shining light set on a hill, when it 
is considered the hope of freedom of all the nations of the 
Earth, when that Statue of Liberty is once again held high, 
without the stain that has been placed upon it by certain 
occupants from Arkansas and others that need to go home.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

But beyond that, we're going to see a time, my 
friends, and if we continue to work and this organization 
continues to grow and people of the grass roots continue to 
come out of their churches and out of their pews and into 
the polls and into the precincts and into the political 
process, we're going to see a time in America when once 
again it can be said, "There is America.  We give her to our 
children and our grandchildren, free, strong, proud, and 
truly one nation under God."

<p>

God bless all of you, and thank you.  God bless you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

HOUSE SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH:  There is a moral 
basis for lower taxes, and it is the belief that parents are 
superior to bureaucrats as the source of a family -- 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It is the belief that if you get up and you go out 
and you work, you have a legitimate first claim on your own 
money, and the government has to earn the right to raise any 
of your money in taxes.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And it is the belief that in a healthy, free 
society, if America has been good to you, you have an 
obligation to be good to your fellow Americans by reaching 
out a helping hand.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

When liberals say compassion, they mean write a 
check to the IRS so they can hire a bureaucrat.  When we say 
compassion, we mean find a neighbor or a friend or a family 
member who needs help, and you help a person who needs help 
in a direct way.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And this morning, we went to two houses where 
Habitat for Humanity, working with the family, had helped 
build a house, and we said a prayer of dedication, and a 
family which had earned the ability to be buying their own 
home had the proud moment of knowing that they and their 
children would become homeowners and citizens and involved 
in their community.  And that, not the government 
bureaucracy, is the right way to help America.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MRS. KEMP:  We are so honored and excited to have 
been given this awesome responsibility.  We thank you for 
your help.  We solicit your prayers.  We are so thrilled as 
a family to be behind Bob Dole, and we thank you for your 
support that is going to make this ticket a winning one.
Thank you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We'll be right back with more 
highlights from the GOP convention in San Diego. Please 
stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thanks for joining us on <i>Straight
Talk</i>. We have more highlights coming up.

<p>

[Segments from Dole/Kemp Kick Off Rally held 
August 16, 1996, follow:]

<p>

ANNOUNCER:  . . . the next President and Vice 
President of the United States, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I have a couple of jerseys that I would like to 
present to the "Dream Team" -- the Dream Team.  I have to 
tell you, and I want to start off with our next Vice 
President, Jack Kemp.  Jack?  There you are, number 15.  I 
want you to know, we got number 15 . . . number 96 for 
Victory '96.   Victory '96, the Dream Team.

<p>

MR. KEMP: I'm thrilled to be on Bob Dole's ticket.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I want you to know, it is with great humility, 
awesome responsibility, incredible excitement, that Joanne 
and I and our family join the Dole team.  Let me say it 
again today in front of our friends in the press, in front 
of our San Diego family and in front of all those 
Republicans with whom we feel such comradeship, it ain't for 
the Republican Party, with all due respect.  This is for 
America.  Bob Dole wants this country to be restored and the 
dream of America for all people.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I've got to tell you, if I had known when 
Spanos(?) gave me this jersey with 15 on it that that was 
going to be the tax cut for America, I wish I was Jim Brown 
and was 32.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But I'll tell you what.  Fifteen is the down 
payment on a new code for America that Bob Dole and I will 
design with the family in mind, with growth and opportunity 
as our goal, and with that equality of opportunity for which 
we as a party -- and Bob Dole spoke last night, too, that 
Lincoln founded the Republican Party in 1860 on one simple 
yet profound predicate:  that all men are created equal; 
that there is a Creator, and He created us equal, and there 
is only one system designed on this Earth to unleash the 
potential of the human spirit to which I talked, and Bob, 
last night.  I want you to know with all my heart that's 
what Kemp, that's what Bob Dole, Elizabeth, Joanne, and this 
whole team are all about.

<p>

I'll close with this thought.  You can imagine, as 
I said earlier, my emotions coming back to San Diego as a 
candidate for the Vice Presidency of the United States.  I 
want to thank Bob for saying in his speech last night, we do 
not look at the other party or those in power today as 
enemies.  They are opponents.  I learned on the football 
field that you can be a good opponent and walk off that 
field, shake hands, and be friends, and I can tell you, my 
best friends in professional football are not just my 
teammates but the guys who used to try to knock my head off 
on Sunday.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I respect that.  I respect that.  It is going to 
be tough, it is going to be long, it is going to be 
incredibly competitive.  And I will just say this to close, 
my second closing -- 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

The Democratic Party, bless their hearts, are not 
democratic.  They are elitist.  That party of Roosevelt and 
Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy has turned into a party 
that wants to run our lives, run your business, manage your 
farm, tell you where to send your children to school.  They 
want to control your money.  They think that if Bob Dole 
cuts their taxes, that it's taking away from the government.

<p>

We are not going to deny the government the 
resources it needs to do what Bob Dole talked about last 
night, to provide a net, a safety net, under which people 
will not be allowed to fall.  There is no man in America who 
cares more about the disabled, the left behind, low income, 
than Bob Dole.  I just want you to know we are going to save 
the net, make it stronger, but we are going to build a 
ladder of opportunity out of poverty upon which all American 
men and women can climb, and that is the Dole-Kemp message.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. DOLE:  I think I did accept the nomination 
last night, so I am proud to be your nominee for President 
of the United States.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

How many think I made a good pick in choosing Jack Kemp?

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And Joanne, too, of course.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Fifteen percent tax cut.  Keep that in mind.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Jack and Joanne have 4 children and 11 
grandchildren, 15.  Fifteen, keep that in mind.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And let me say to my friends -- I know the press 
may not be listening, but let me just say to my friends -- 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I didn't mean it that way.  I mean, I just want to 
tell you a little secret.

<p>

AUDIENCE:  It was an A-plus.

<p>

MR. DOLE:  All right.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

If I have anything at all in dealing with my 
colleagues in the Congress of the United States over the 
past many years, it has been credibility.  Democrats and 
Republicans -- the Democrats may have to take a little leave 
of absence here for a while -- but I would not propose a tax 
cut, and I would have not proposed the economic package had 
I not been certain that we could achieve it without hurting 
social security, without hurting Medicare.

<p>

But I really believe that we have an obligation to 
families with children and taxpayers all across America to 
make our tax code flatter and fairer and simpler, and we're 
going to get the job done.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

So we're excited.  I said when I arrived in San 
Diego it was getting exciting, and Elizabeth said, "Well, 
it's about time."

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And I'm now leaving full of excitement and full of 
enthusiasm and full of confidence.

<p>

I did call President Reagan yesterday about 4 
o'clock.  When I got him on the phone, I said, "Mr. 
President, tonight I will give my acceptance speech, and I 
want to say as I do that I have talked to you, and that out 
of great respect from all Americans for you, Mr. President, 
I want to be able to say that we're going to win because we 
have the right agenda, because we are the party of ideas, 
and because we want to complete the Reagan revolution."

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And he said, "That's fine."

<p>

And then I said to him what a great job Nancy 
Reagan had done in her tribute to him just two nights 
before.  And then Nancy came on the line and we had a good 
visit.

<p>

But the bottom line is, Ronald Reagan certainly 
was a man for his time.  He provided great leadership for 
all Americans regardless of party --

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

-- followed by my good friend, George Bush, who 
did the same and should have been reelected.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

So I want to make the same plea that Jack did.
When you go back home -- some of you are already home, but 
the message is the same.  Contact your neighbors, people you 
go to church with, people you go to service clubs with, 
people you work with, whether it is in the hotel, whether it 
is somewhere else.  Let them know about the Republican 
Party.  Let them know that we're looking ahead.

<p>

I see all these great young people here this 
morning.  That's the future of our party.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And if we don't keep our word, if you can't trust 
us, then throw us out.  But I trust the American people.  I 
believe you will trust us, and together we will make America 
a better place as we go into the next century.

<p>

Thank you.  God bless America.

<p>

[Applause.]

MS. HAMRICK:  We'll be right back with more 
convention highlights here from San Diego, California.
Please stay with us.

headlines, issues, controversies when you join us here on 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Thanks for 
watching.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I want to know why you're here, "Mr. President."

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  Apparently -- I don't 
know if you heard -- this is a late-breaking story -- but I 
believe the Republicans snuck into the White House and 
removed some personal effects, papers and things, from the 
top of the shredder in, I mean top of the file cabinet in 
Hillary's private quarters.  I don't know if you've seen 
this or not, but Hillary was never in Hanoi with Jane Fonda.
Never, ever was she in Hanoi with Jane Fonda.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A lot of things were said, Mr. President.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  I was nowhere near 
Gary Hart and Miss Rice, Donna Rice -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I see.  It's all a lie.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR: All a lie. And there 
is absolutely, positively no truth whatsoever to the rumor 
that Newt and I are in any way, shape, or form related, not 
even halfway.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I see.

<p>

Mr. President, what brings you to the Republican convention?

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR: Well, what I'm trying 
to do is right this terrible injustice to myself and my 
administration and my family. I'm going to ask Bob Dole, 
Jack Kemp, and Newt Gingrich to 'fess up to this, basically.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I see.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  And if need be, I will 
take it to the convention floor.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Any thoughts about the fact that now 
they seem to be 9 points away from you instead of 20?

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  You know, any time you 
get somebody new on board, obviously, there's going to be a 
little bit of excitement.  And not only that; he's got nice 
hair.  We all know that the American public -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Nice hair sells.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  Nice hair sells.  So 
it'll wear off in a few weeks.  I'm not concerned.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for your time, Mr. President.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR: Thank you very much. 
God bless you.  God bless America.  Don't forget, a party in 
the Presidential suite.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we are taking a look at the 
Democratic National Convention and how the Democrats face 
the problems affecting American families.  We will talk 
about Family Research Council's role at the convention and 
how the pro-life and pro-family message plays to a key group 
within the Democratic Party.  You won't want to miss seeing 
some of these DNC highlights.

<p>

But first we bring you Robert Knight, FRC's 
director of cultural studies. Just yesterday, I spoke with
Bob about the historical Senate vote which protected 
marriage as it has been defined since the beginning of time:
as a union between one man and one woman.  In fact, the 
Family Research Council provided key information to those 
drafting the Defense of Marriage Act, also known as DOMA, 
and spearheaded an ad campaign to inform the public of the 
importance of protecting marriage.

<p>

Bob and I discussed the influence gay activists
asserted in their attempts to redefine marriage and to pass
a gay civil rights bill, also known as the Employment Non-Discrimination 
Act, or ENDA.  Let's hear what Bob had to say
as we bring you insights we're sure you didn't hear on the
national news, as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

As you well know, yesterday there were some very 
historic votes in the Senate, first on the Defense of 
Marriage Act and then on ENDA, the gay civil rights bill.  
It is amazing that we are talking about whether marriage is 
really a man and a woman.

<p>

We are going to talk in a couple moments about the 
implications of that, but first, could you tell us what was 
the chain of events that led us to actually debate what is 
marriage and how sex should be interjected in the workplace.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, it all started several years 
ago in Hawaii when three homosexual couples came to the 
state and said, look, we want marriage licenses.  The state 
said no, you can't, because it is reserved for men and women 
together.  And they took their case to court, and it wound 
its way up to the Hawaiian Supreme Court, which sent it down 
to the lower court with instructions warning them that 
they're going to legalize same-sex unions as marriage if the
state can't find a compelling interest.

<p>

That case has wound its way back up to the 
Hawaiian circuit court level, where it began yesterday, on 
September 10.  That case could result in the legalization of 
gay marriage, so called.

<p>

Now, this presents a conflict for the rest of the 
states, because they are supposed to recognize each other's 
marriage licenses and driver's licenses, and so forth, under 
the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution.

<p>

And so people who are concerned about this being 
forced on other states drafted the Defense of Marriage Act 
at the federal level, which does two things.  It defines 
marriage as the union of a man and a woman as husband and 
wife, for federal purposes, because it is in the Federal 
Code hundreds of times -- you'd better know what it means -- 
and it gives the states protection against being forced by 
the Full Faith and Credit Clause from having their marriage 
laws radically redefined.

<p>

It doesn't impose a federal definition of 
marriage.  I mean, it would be nice if it did, but then 
again, that's not really the Federal Government's role.  But 
the Federal Government does have a role under the Full Faith 
and Credit Clause.  Congress is ordered to interpret the use 
of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.

<p>

So this is entirely constitutional, and it is
necessary, because gay activists have said they plan to fly
couples from the 50 states to Honolulu, get the marriage
licenses, come back, and raise the issue in the courts. So
we needed this kind of protection.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So the Defense of Marriage Act is an 
attempt to stop what the gay activists have said that they 
are going to do, which is break down the definition of 
marriage and the institution of marriage in all the 50 
states by forcing it through the courts rather than 
legislatively.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, exactly, and some of the gay 
activists have been very candid about this.  Michelangelo
Cignorilli(?), who writes for the <i>New York Times</i>
periodically, wrote in <i>Out</i> magazine that same-sex marriage 
-- quote, unquote -- was the final tool to get rid of the
rest of the sodomy laws -- and there are sodomy laws in 18
states -- teach children about homosexuality in the public
schools, and, in short, usher in a sea change about how the
public views homosexuality.

<p>

He also said gay activists should acquire "same-sex 
marriage" not as a way of living up to society's moral 
codes but as a way to destroy this "archaic institution" 
which, as it is, "serves to keep us down."  In other words, 
it's not about two people yearning to get a marriage license 
out there; it's about an organized group of very well-heeled, 
very aggressive homosexual activists who are trying 
to use marriage as a weapon in a larger struggle, which is 
to force society to affirm homosexuality as good and normal.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As you know, Bob, the polling 
numbers on marriage and support for the Defense of Marriage 
Act have risen volcanically.  In Hawaii, which is a liberal 
state, you've got numbers now close to 80 -- they have risen 
about 15 points or so -- and nationwide above 80 percent in 
favor of defense of marriage.

<p>

And so you take this really popular bill, and 
we've seen some gutting techniques and amendments added, in 
particular from Senator Kennedy.  Could you tell us a little 
bit about that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. This was interesting, the way 
the gay activists saw this coming as a steamroller and said, 
well, we have to throw something in front of it.  They got 
Senator Ted Kennedy to throw the Employment Non-
Discrimination Act in front of it, and that is what we call 
the gay jobs bill. It would be an historic restructuring of 
civil rights, because it would add a behavioral component 
for the first time. Sexual orientation would acquire the 
same status as race, gender, and religious rights.  It has 
never been accorded that at the federal level.

<p>

So they hoped that this would be what we call in
Washington here a poison pill, where you attach something to
a bill you don't like, hoping that people won't swallow it,
and thus you kill the whole bill.

<p>

In negotiations with the Senate leadership, Trent 
Lott and Don Nickles, who is the chief sponsor of DOMA, they 
agreed to bring up four amendments on each side.  One of 
them was this gay jobs bill. When Senator Kennedy saw the
Republicans' amendments, he didn't like them, canceled the 
whole deal, and they ended up with a deal allowing a 
straight vote on DOMA and ENDA separately. That cleared the
way for a clean vote on DOMA.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One thing that is a little 
confusing, I think, is whether or not the Defense of 
Marriage Act can be canceled out by the gay civil rights 
bill, ENDA. Is that possible?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: ENDA would apply only to workplaces.
So it really wouldn't affect the marriage law that much.
What it would do is send a signal that the Republican-controlled 
Senate, in an election year, is talking about a 
national gay rights bill. I think the gays have to be happy 
about that, that they have gotten us to this point, that 
there hasn't been enough serious opposition among the 
leadership of the Republican Party, in particular -- because 
the Democratic Party is behind this -- and that is why it 
has become an issue.  If they had been steadfast, I don't 
think we ever would have seen this. We didn't even see this
under the Democratic Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to talk a couple of 
minutes, Bob, live about the implications of the two 
historic votes. But in terms of the gay civil rights bill,
would it inject sexuality into the workplace?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Right. It is supposed to reduce 
intolerance toward homosexuality and bisexuality; it is in 
the bill.  Actually, it would increase sexual tension in the 
workplace, because how would an employer know who is 
homosexual and who is not, unless the employee makes a point 
of it?  That has been the case all along.

<p>

I see a great threat to religious freedom, freedom 
of speech, freedom of association, because laws like this 
are not passed in a vacuum.  You've got the whole realm of 
sexual harassment laws to deal with that are kind of coupled 
to it.  What if a person has a Bible on his desk and a gay 
employee says, "Look, that book is homophobic and it says 
homosexuality is wrong.  That creates a hostile atmosphere 
to me, and I feel threatened."  What if the employer to do? 
Tell the guy to put the Bible away?  Now he's trampling on 
religious freedom.

<p>

How about the provision in ENDA which says there 
can be no consideration at all based on sexual orientation? 
So what if an employer prefers to hire a person that he 
thinks is morally straight, like a good boy scout would be? 
A homosexual would-be employee can say, "Well, you hired 
that person because he was heterosexual."  And the employer 
would say, "No, I didn't. I did it on qualification."  And 
the gay would-be employee will say, "Well, prove it."  And 
you could see where this can go. With a couple of activist 
lawyers and a couple of liberal judges, you've got a big gun 
aimed at American business' head.

<p>

So I cannot understand why more people who should 
know better don't see this as what it is, a massive 
expansion of federal power over America's workplaces.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, Bob, we'll be back in just a 
couple moments to talk with you about the Defense of 
Marriage Act and the gay civil rights bill. Please stay 
with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are joined by Robert 
Knight, director of cultural studies for FRC.  Bob played a 
key role in relaying information pertinent to the Defense of 
Marriage Act and the gay civil rights bill.  Bob, thanks so 
much for being with us on the show.

<p>

Yesterday, before the vote, you and I were talking 
about how we got to this situation, the court case in 
Hawaii, in which arguments started yesterday, and all the 
different states getting concerned.  But now we've had the 
votes.  Why don't you quickly first tell us the results of 
the two votes, and then let's start talking implications.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, DOMA was a resounding victory.
The Defense of Marriage Act passed by a vote of 85-14.
There was one Senator missing, David Pryor, who was out of 
town because of a son's medical emergency.

<p>

What was most interesting, though, was the vote 
following that on what we call the gay jobs bill and Senator 
Kennedy calls the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.  What 
that act does is add sexual orientation to civil rights law 
in the workplace, therefore giving it the highest possible 
protection, right along with ethnicity or race.

<p>

We squeaked by.  They defeated ENDA by one vote, 
50 to 49.  Now, that's the first time the U.S. Senate has 
voted on a gay rights bill, and we just saw it go down by 
one vote, and I think that is very significant.  It shows 
that the homosexual activist lobby was very active in 
promoting that.  It is almost as if they gave up on DOMA 
because millions of people, frankly, were hammering the 
Senate on DOMA.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Calls and phone calls and letters 
and talk shows and -- 

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Oh, yes. Even many liberal -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A lot of energy.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, a lot of energy on DOMA.  People 
just saw the threat to marriage and reacted.

<p>

ENDA wasn't on their radar screen.  It is almost 
as if the homosexuals did an end run.  In fact, ENDA 
originally was attached to DOMA as a killer amendment by 
Senate Kennedy, and then through a series of parliamentary 
maneuvers, it was stripped off DOMA so DOMA could have a 
clean vote.  But then the compromise that Kennedy extracted 
was to have a vote on ENDA straight up, which was 
unprecedented.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think one of the things that we 
have to mention is, even though the gay civil rights bill 
was defeated, Senator Pryor said that he intended to vote in 
favor of that, and in a 50-50 split, I think we have to 
anticipate that the Clinton Administration, with Vice 
President Al Gore having the tie-breaker, probably would 
have voted in favor of gay civil rights, given some of their 
other policies and their discussion of gay civil rights.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Every vote counted, and I 
didn't know whether ENDA would go through or not.  A very 
good sign was when Nancy Kassebaum, the Kansas Republican, 
took the floor against it.  She is not exactly a big 
opponent of gay rights; in fact, she prefaced her remarks 
saying, "Well, I support rights for gay people," and so 
forth.

<p>

But this bill would shackle businesses with 
another layer of federal regulation.  It would be an 
unprecedented intrusion into the workplace.  And it would 
interfere with the beliefs of millions of Americans.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have to jump on that for a 
second, because everyone understands in their workplace EEOC 
regulations, equal opportunity regulations, that say perhaps 
we need a percentage of so many women or so many of a 
certain minority, or we are looking at a community; we have 
to have this kind of mixture to legally qualify for federal 
grants or even to avoid prosecution.

<p>

So to take a look at something that talks about 
sex in civil rights legislation, doesn't that mean we would 
have to ask every person, "How do you have sex?" when they 
are hired?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, that would protect an employer,
I suppose, under ENDA.  ENDA has a non-quotas provision in 
it. They say specifically you cannot base quotas on sexual 
orientation.  But we have seen similar promises before in 
the 1964 Civil Rights Act when Hubert Humphrey said, "Don't 
worry, this won't lead to quotas."  And we know what 
happened.  We got racial quotas, we got gender quotas, we 
got the whole ball of wax.

<p>

You know what would happen.  Employers would try 
to find out the sexual orientation of their employees so 
they could be seen to be complying with the act.  Quotas 
follow civil rights laws as naturally as day follows night. 
It is the only way they can prove they are complying.

<p>

And, as you said, it would inject sex into the 
workplace.  Right now most employers really don't care if 
their employees are homosexual or not.  There really isn't 
this great problem. In fact, Ed Mickens(?), a writer for 
<i>The Advocate</i> magazine, a gay national magazine, wrote two 
years ago that gays aren't being fired from their jobs in a 
big way.  In fact, because the Cracker Barrel had fired a 
lesbian, the fact that it was so sensational pointed out the 
larger fact that it just isn't happening.  You have a case 
here or there, but there is no great national upsurge in 
rooting out homosexuals from their jobs.

<p>

And so they have manufactured this issue.  And had 
they prevailed, we are talking about a threat to religious 
freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of association.  How 
about a Christian employee who puts a Bible on his desk, and 
a guy in the office who maybe he didn't know was gay says, 
"You know, that's a homophobic book.  I feel threatened.  
You have created an atmosphere of sexual harassment here."

<p>

What is the poor employer to do?  If he tells the 
guy to take the Bible out, he is just trampling on religious 
freedom.  If he leaves the Bible in, the gay goes to the 
EEOC and says, "Hey, I feel put upon; I feel harassed."  I 
mean, this is a lawyer's dream, this kind of legislation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems that the only way that you 
can deal with it is to talk openly about it.  In the Sunday 
<i>New York Times</i>, there was a fascinating article on the front 
of the national section about people who cross-dress and 
bisexuals saying that they are not, to use a phrase, 
"straight homosexuals," where they are not just all guys or 
just all girls; they like to be a mixture of all, so that 
they need their own separate classification.

<p>

So we are going to have, I guess, straight 
straight and straight homosexual or lesbian and then people 
who cross-dress, and it seems like the checkoff for man, 
woman, minority, sexual, occupation, is going to be pretty 
intense.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, it has got to be.  And the 
whole problem with sexual orientation is, it's in the mind. 
And the law concerns human actions, not thoughts.  This 
would be an unprecedented attempt to inject fortune-telling 
into the law.  I mean, how would you know what is in 
somebody's mind unless they tell you?

<p>

A friend of mine, Paul Mirro(?), who works for Bob 
Dornan, wrote a funny piece just yesterday called <i>My
Favorite Martian</i>. It's about an employer who sits down with 
an employee, a long-time employee, and the employee says to 
the employer, "I need to talk to you.  I have to tell you 
something."  He says, "I'm a Martian."

<p>

The employer says, "Well, I didn't know you were a 
Martian."  The employee says, "Well, I've kept it secret."
It goes into a parody, and he uses all the language the gay 
activists use.  When it comes down to it, the employer says,
"Well, since nothing you have done is Martian and I didn't 
know you were Martian, why are you making it evident to me?" 
The employee says, "Because I want to be recognized for 
what I am."

<p>

The employer says, "Well, then, aren't you 
imposing your Martianness on the rest of us?"  And the 
employee says, "Well, yeah, but why not?  What's wrong with 
being a Martian?"  And again, he could never nail down 
exactly what a Martian was.  He said his parents weren't 
Martians, but he just knew he was a Martian.  I knows this 
sounds silly, but it shows how silly the whole thing is.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One of the things that has been 
discussed is whether or not the gay civil rights bill might 
be attached to an appropriations bill, whether we might see 
it one more time before this Congress leaves.  Senator 
Kennedy has been a real champion of it.  Do you think that 
is possible?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: It is possible. Our lobbyists have 
told us that there is scuttlebutt on the floor that they 
might try to attach it to another bill and hope Senator 
Pryor is back in town to break the tie.

<p>

I am not sure that is what the Clinton 
Administration would like to have happen, because then you 
would have Al Gore breaking the tie.  That would put the 
administration in a very visible position of supporting a 
gay rights bill on a national level.  They are already on 
record as doing so, but this would notch it up a few 
degrees.

<p>

I am not sure that any political campaign really 
wants to inject that element into a campaign.  The 
Republicans have been very quiet about it, and the Democrats 
haven't exactly made it a huge issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. The <i>Post</i> made a point this 
morning of talking about the rather subdued debate leading 
to a rather quick vote, which anyone who watches much C-SPAN 
knows that that is not very normal.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: No, it isn't. Both parties are 
uncomfortable with the issue.  They wanted to get it off 
their plates and on to other business, and they did do the 
right thing by rejecting ENDA and passing DOMA, in my 
estimation.

<p>

I think the DOMA victory should give a lot of 
people heart that there has been a realization that you can 
go too far.  You can knock at the stilts of civilization and 
perhaps bring it down, and this was a lot of Americans 
shoring up that foundation with DOMA.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So where do the bills go from now?
Obviously, one -- Senator Kennedy is saying that the gay 
civil rights bill he will probably just reintroduce next 
time.  Where does DOMA go?  It has been passed by the 
Senate.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: DOMA goes right to President 
Clinton's desk, and in the words of our president, Gary
Bauer, "President, eat your spinach and sign the bill."
And, of course, that is Gary's reference to the fact that he 
suspects that Bill Clinton doesn't really want to sign the 
bill, but he said he will, so he expects him to do so.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That was a real point that the 
Republicans made on the floor: If the President likes it, 
why wouldn't you be for it?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Well, I don't think everybody 
is believing that the President really likes it.  After all, 
the President was on record as supporting ENDA while it was 
attached as an amendment to DOMA in an effort to kill DOMA. 
So it is kind of, on one hand he is saying, "Okay, I'm for 
marriage"; on the other hand, "I'm for all these guys 
attaching these things that everybody says might kill it."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you say, Bob, to people who 
think that it is only a matter of simple fairness?  We heard 
that phrase: "It's a matter of simple justice and a matter 
of simple fairness." Do we want someone who is homosexual 
or lesbian to be fired from their job for being homosexual? 
It's a matter of simple fairness.  What is your response to 
that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, I think the polls are very 
revealing.  If you frame it that way, "Do you think gays 
ought to be fired just for being gay?" almost nobody says 
yes, because in a vacuum like that, it sounds unfair; it 
sounds un-American.  And it probably is, depending on the 
job and how the sexuality was made manifest.  You know, a 
lot of these concepts sound great until you try them in the 
real world.

<p>

What ENDA would have done was, instead of leveling 
the playing field, it would have added an entirely new 
component.  It would have allowed gay employees or would-be 
employees an enormous ability to litigate against an 
employer if they didn't get what they wanted.  And it is not 
as if they are not a litigious group.  I mean, they've got 
suits against the boy scouts, they've got suits about sexual 
harassment, they've got gay lawyers hammering this issue all 
over the country.  They were licking their chops at the 
prospect of having a federal law in place that said you must 
take sexual orientation into account, basically.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But would the research indicate that 
homosexuals and lesbians are being fired and that they are 
suffering economically because of the way in which they have 
sex?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: There is no evidence that that is 
happening. There are probably a handful of cases where 
employers have said, "I'm not comfortable with this 
behavior; you'd better work someplace else."  Depending on 
the situation, that might be okay, it might not.  What if 
it's a day camp?  What if it's the boy scouts?  What if it's 
an organization that deals with children?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. It is easy to see in a case 
recently in Virginia where a teacher was in pornographic, 
homosexual films, working as a gym teacher with young boys. 
When this information was revealed, he was fired.  And 
would he not have an actionable case under the gay civil 
rights bill to come back and say, "Hey, they fired me for my 
sexual practices"?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, that is right, because the term 
is "sexual orientation" in the law, and real or perceived. 
That's the way they define it:  homosexuality, bisexuality, 
heterosexuality, whether real or perceived.

<p>

He could say, "Well, look.  Because I was in a gay 
porn film, an ordinary person might conclude I'm homosexual. 
Therefore, I am being fired on an outside activity, 
unrelated to work, has nothing to do with my job as a 
teacher, but it's the perception that I'm homosexual, that's 
my orientation, and you're firing me."  I think he would 
have a case under ENDA.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Could you go into the case, too, 
Bob, out of Canada where a mayor ran into an interesting 
circumstance, to help people understand how some of these 
things have broken out?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. The gays use the rhetoric of 
fairness:  gays just want to be left alone.  But I think the 
situation in an Ontario town, Hamilton, proves the opposite. 
The mayor was approached by gay rights groups and asked to 
create a gay pride week, and he said, "Well, this is a 
Catholic, blue-collar town.  I don't think so.  You know, I 
have nothing against you guys, but I'm not going to proclaim 
a pride in something most people think is wrong."

<p>

They hauled him before the Human Rights Commission 
in Ontario, and he was threatened with a fine of $5,000 
personally for hate-mongering and bigotry because he 
wouldn't celebrate homosexuality.  So that's not exactly 
asking to be left alone and just being tolerant.

<p>

This is a very aggressive agenda that is designed 
to harness the power of law to force affirmation of 
homosexuality on everybody else, because, as you asked, are 
gays doing okay in the workplace?  Yes, I would say so.  The 
surveys show they are among the top group in per capita 
income, disposable income, college degrees, advanced 
degrees, even frequent flyer miles.  I mean, they travel a 
lot.  The gay magazines are full of luxury items.  They're 
not hurting.  They're not hurting like blacks were after 
years of racism and Jim Crow laws.  They just don't meet the 
requirement for a put-upon minority group.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think one thing that we have to 
do, from the Family Research Council, we are always looking 
at what happens to children.  Looking at the DOMA and the 
gay civil rights bill, one of the things that we are all 
seeing a lot of is lesbian couples adopting -- this has 
become very vogue lately -- and a lot of controversy now 
that we are in the back-to-school time about human sexuality 
classes, and whether or not we say that homosexuality exists 
or whether we say that it is morally neutral and people are 
just as welcome to enter that as any other lifestyle.

<p>

How do you think a gay civil rights bill would 
affect lesbian or homosexual adoptions or the kinds of 
things that we teach in a sex education class?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, it would be a tremendous boost 
to the attempts by homosexuals to adopt children.  We saw 
that in a Florida case right after Amendment 2 was shot down 
by the Supreme Court.  That was the Colorado amendment that 
said you can't make sexual orientation a specially protected 
class.  A lesbian lawyer misinterpreted the ruling but used 
it in a case, an adoption case, saying the Supreme Court 
says you can't discriminate in any way against homosexuals, 
even in parenting.  And, of course, the Court never said any 
such thing, but that is the kind of thing that happens when 
you enshrine the concept of sexual orientation within the 
law.

<p>

There is a perception that if it ain't illegal, 
it's okay, and if you raise the bar even higher and say not 
only isn't it illegal but we're going to give it special 
benefits and privileges we don't give just any behavior, 
we're going to make --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Because we're celebrating it.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: We're celebrating, we're protecting 
it.  Society has a stake in making sure people continue to 
engage in homosexual behavior.  That's what they're saying.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to keep up with 
you, Bob, on what happens as I know this comes back, and 
when <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll bring you some highlights 
from the Democratic National Convention and we'll see how 
the Democrats addressed issues affecting you and your 
family. Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Scenes from the Chicago Democratic National 
Convention, then segments from Celebration of Life rally 
held August 26, 1996, follow:]

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE RALPH HALL: Let me just say to 
you, to set the stage for brevity for the other Members of 
Congress and the other people who will speak, I served in 
the Texas Senate for 10 years, I served as a judge for 12 
years, I have been 16 years in the House of Representatives.
I have heard testimony from fathers and mothers.  I have 
heard testimony from pastors.  I have heard testimony from 
men and women of medicine.  I have heard testimony for all 
those years, and after hearing all of that from the word go, 
with rancor toward none but prayers for all, I come down on 
the side of life.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE COLLIN PETERSON:  . . . and I think 
one of the good things about the fact that you're here at 
this convention and your presence is here is that you're 
getting at what we've been trying to do in the Congress, and 
that is to try to end some of the partisanship, to try to 
have some common-sense solutions to things, and try to end 
all this bickering and fighting that goes on between the 
parties.

<p>

We have worked hard to do that.  I hope that your 
organizations and your groups will look at Members of 
Congress based on what their beliefs are, what their voting 
records are, and where they stand on the issues, and not 
necessarily what party they belong to.

<p>

There are 43 members of the House of 
Representatives that vote pro-life 100 percent of the time. 
You can count on us to be there all the time. That's 
almost a fourth of the Democratic Caucus. There are a lot 
of people that are pro-life in the Democratic Party.  I am 
one of those people.  I am proud to be pro-life. . .

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE BART STUPAK: The issue before us 
today is not about the politics of choice but the deeply 
held principles of life and living.  The issue before us 
today is not about allowing the continuation of ghastly and 
objectionable procedures but of rededicating ourselves to 
the belief that all children should be protected.  They 
should live, and they should be allowed to grow.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. RALPH REED: Our message to President Clinton,
Al Gore, and Chris Dodd is, we will not allow you to drive 
pro-lifers out of the Democratic Party.  This party is going 
to continue to have pro-life activists.

<p>

[Conclusion of DNC segments.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It was wonderful to see the pro-life 
Democrats speaking out at rallies such as the one held by 
the Christian Coalition and the National Right to Life 
Committee.

<p>

Here to discuss the Democratic National Convention 
and its impact on America's families, we are joined by 
Maureen Roselli, executive director of the Catholic 
Alliance, and Cathy Deeds, deputy director of government 
relations for FRC.  Welcome to you both.

<p>

You all were both in Chicago taking a pro-family, 
pro-life message to the Democratic convention.  Whom did you 
find there that was willing to hear that message?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, we were very fortunate. As
you said, Christian Coalition hosted a rally called 
Celebration of Life on Monday.  We had that at the Field 
Museum.  It was attended by over 450 people, which was 
wonderful.  Collin Peterson and Representatives Stenholm, 
Stupak, and Volkmer all spoke at that rally.  So it was 
wonderful to see the Representatives come out, talk about 
the pro-life movement, and be so supported by such a large 
number of pro-life Democrats.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Who do you think represents the pro-family 
and pro-life constituency within the Democratic 
Party?  Certainly a lot of people talk about Reagan 
Democrats in terms of a lot of blue-collar family people and 
Catholics nationwide.  Do you think that still represents 
the group that really resonates with that message?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, certainly as Catholics we 
embrace the pro-life movement because it's a doctrinal issue 
with our faith. You cannot be anti-life and be a Catholic. 
So certainly those Catholics who are in the Democratic 
Party should be going toward the pro-life movement.
Certainly Governor Casey has been a wonderful example of 
that in the Democratic Party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: He now heads the American Families Organization.

<p>

And, Cathy, I know you were there for Family 
Research Council.  What did you find as you were looking for 
people to talk with about a pro-family message?

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Well, of course, as you know, Kristi, 
Family Research Council is a nonpartisan organization, but 
we feel like our issues and our message transcend political 
parties, so FRC wanted to have a presence at both the 
Republican and the Democratic conventions.

<p>

Although it was a little more limited in the sense 
that we had to talk about maybe fewer issues that some 
Democratic people would be concerned about, we brought some 
messages to the various delegates, like -- we can get into 
those later on -- partial-birth abortion and family tax 
relief, the Defense of Marriage Act, which many of them 
should and do support.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to hear more 
about that in a moment.  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i>
continues our discussion of the Democratic National 
Convention. Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are talking about the 
Democratic National Convention and the impact of policy 
discussed there on America's families.  I am joined by some 
key players in the fight for life, Maureen Roselli, 
executive director for the Catholic Alliance, and Cathy 
Deeds, the Family Research Council's deputy director of 
government relations.  Welcome back.

<p>

There were some issues that sent both of you to 
Chicago.  Maureen, what were you hoping to talk about?  What 
issues had the Catholic Alliance said, look, these are our 
key issues?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, the key issue that we wanted 
to bring for the Democratic Party was, of course, the pro-life 
issue.  We went to participate in the Celebration of 
Life that was hosted by Christian Coalition and National 
Right to Life, as I mentioned before.  Unfortunately, we 
found not as much tolerance for that discussion as we found 
in perhaps the other convention.

<p>

We, of course, are a nonpartisan organization. As 
a matter of fact, half of our advisory board is Democrat, 
and our membership is well represented by both Democrats and 
Republicans and even independents who join our organization.

<p>

But we basically found that the platform of the 
Democratic Party is so extreme, and it is only embraced by 
perhaps 5 to 10 percent of the population, and that platform 
is that abortion should be granted on demand and paid for by 
tax dollars.

<p>

So, really, as I said, it is only embraced by 5 to 
10 percent of the people, and we believe that, generally, 
Democrats are much more mainstream on this issue, and 
certainly Catholic Democrats are far more pro-life.  In a 
recent poll, it was discovered that 10 to 15 percent of 
Catholics would not vote for the Democratic Party because of 
the partial-birth abortion issue, even though they were 
Democrat.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Partial-birth abortion is a 
tremendous rallying cry right now.  Cathy, there is going to 
be an event tomorrow, Thursday, surrounding that.  Could you 
tell us a little bit more about that?

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Yes, our listeners might be interested 
to know that. A very unprecedented event, really, that we 
expect about 100 Catholic bishops, and all of the Catholic 
cardinals in the United States are going to be here in 
Washington, and they are going to the Capitol to really 
plead with President Clinton one final time, or actually to 
Congress to override the President's veto of (the) partial-birth 
abortion (ban).

<p>

Partial-birth abortion is a good example when 
we are talking about pro-life Democrats, because, as 
everyone probably knows by now, it was such a bipartisan-supported 
bill, and more than 72 Democrats voted to ban this 
procedure.  And yet this President that says he wants to 
make abortion safe, legal, and rare, he could have done that 
by signing this bill, and he vetoed it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And to describe this horrible thing, 
a child, generally a child that could live outside the womb,
is delivered feet first into the birth canal, stabbed in the 
base of the skull, living brain tissue suctioned out, and 
then the dead child delivered, a child that the developer of 
that procedure said could live, that the majority of these 
horrible procedures are done on viable babies.

<p>

This has been a tremendous rallying cry for 
Republicans and Democrats.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Yes, absolutely, and it has been a 
really unifying issue for Catholics as well.  As Cathy said, 
the bishops have, in an unprecedented move this summer, 
asked people to participate in a postcard campaign on 
partial-birth abortion.  Even the Holy Father spoke out 
against this heinous crime, which is really, as Helen 
Alvarey(?) said, four-fifths infanticide and one-fifth 
abortion.

<p>

Catholic Alliance mailed out over 572,000 letters 
to Americans, Catholic Americans, educating them about this 
horrible procedure, and we have received tremendous response 
calling for the override of the President's veto.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What was your experience when you 
talked to the people at the Democratic National Convention 
about partial-birth abortion, which has been certainly a 
rallying cry, and then the life issue in general?  Were they 
interested in talking to you all about that?

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Well, as a matter of fact, it was 
quite difficult in some sense, and I was reading a poll 
during the convention that said more than 60 percent of the 
convention delegates were pro-abortion, and in fact 77 
percent of the delegates supported the President's veto of 
the partial-birth abortion bill, clearly out of step with 
mainstream America and even Democrats, because we know about 
a third of self-identified Democrats are pro-life.

<p>

So we kind of had a difficult time breaking in to 
that particular audience, but we still tried, and what 
Family Research Council generally did was kind of just pass 
out our information on the partial-birth abortion.  People 
seemed thankful.  We had a few conversations.  But I don't 
know how well it really resonated.  We got a lot of paper 
out there.  Hopefully, people will be contacting us.
Hopefully, it dispelled some of the myths that they are 
hearing certainly from the White House, unfortunately.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The myths on partial-birth abortions.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Did you find that people were 
generally uninformed about the realities?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, I think, like Family Research 
Council, Catholic Alliance, our contact at the Democratic 
convention was almost limited to those people who are 
already pro-life and pro-family.  We attended the Wednesday 
rally that was held outside of the actual convention.  There 
was a large rally; about 1,500 people attended.  Catholic 
Alliance was there and Family Research Council was there, as 
well, and they were passing out their fine information on 
the partial-birth abortion ban.

<p>

But I found that it was generally the people who 
were already pro-life who were taking that information, who 
were willing to talk to us about partial-birth abortion or 
any life issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Frustrating.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Yes.

<p>

MS. DEEDS: But that was another reason to be 
there, as well, to be of support for these pro-life 
Democratic heroes who really are in the minority and are 
oftentimes kind of punished or pushed to the side; nobody 
wants to hear from them.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: And we found that that was so, even 
though the Democratic Party talked about their "conscience 
clause" that is now in their platform, that they are 
supposed to be tolerant of the -- quote, unquote -- 
intolerant pro-lifers.

<p>

So even though that may be part of their platform 
now, our experience was still that we generally were only 
received by those people who were already, again, pro-life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There were some interesting 
contrasts in the two platforms, and we are going to have to 
talk about that in a moment.  More about the Democratic 
National Convention when we return.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are discussing the 
Democrats' role in the fight for America's families, and to 
help in that discussion, I am joined once again by Maureen 
Roselli and Cathy Deeds.  Maureen, I have to apologize in 
saying your name wrong the entire time.

<p>

It was interesting, though, to contrast -- Family 
Research Council was at San Diego and at Chicago, both, and 
the brouhaha over the way in which the Republicans weren't 
equally pro-abortion and pro-life seemed absent from the 
Democratic convention.  Did you find that the Democrats had 
more unanimity on this point and that is why it wasn't worth 
reporting?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, actually, I think it was 
really a media decision; at least that is what we found.  
There are the same number of pro-abortion Republicans as 
there are pro-life Democrats, and yet the pro-abortion 
Republicans received much more media attention than the pro-life 
Democrats did at their convention.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And how many is that?  That's 40?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: It's 40, roughly.

<p>

MS. DEEDS: It's roughly about the same number, 
because we lack -- we oftentimes rely on those pro-life 
Democrats to make up the votes that the pro-abortion 
Republicans -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Which is kind of an untold story in 
a lot of pro-life votes -- 

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Yes, I don't think people realize -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: -- is that there is a solid voting 
bloc of pro-life Democrats.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: That is right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And so, even though the numbers were 
the same, the coverage seemed very different then.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: It did, and there seemed to be much 
more attention drawn to the pro-abortion Republicans because 
there seemed to be more perhaps media pressure to change the 
platform of the Republican Party than there was to change 
the platform of the Democratic Party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Republican Party had a very 
strong pro-life plank, you know, very much a commitment to 
the unborn. And then they said, although we recognize that 
there are people with different views, and we want to be 
kind and respectful to each other.

<p>

And the Democrats.  Describe to us -- you said 
earlier a very extreme platform, but a lot of media 
attention was made about their so-called tolerance language, 
as well.  Was that reflected?  At the Republican convention, 
we saw a lot of pro-abortion speakers.  And at the 
Democratic convention, what did you all find?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, we know that Tony Hall was 
able to speak at the Democratic convention, but of course, 
what he was able to say was very limited.  When Cynthia 
McKinney of Georgia, who is a pro-abortionist, called for 
tolerance of the pro-life people in her party, she was met 
by silence at the convention.

<p>

So I think that certainly at the Republican Party, 
the Republicans seemed to go a little more out of their way 
to represent the pro-abortion side.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What was your experience, Cathy?

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Just to add onto that, I think the 
Democrats were certainly more representative at their 
convention of their platform.  As we have been saying, their 
platform -- very extreme; it reaffirms the <i>Roe v. Wade</i>
decision, which is abortion on demand; no sort of call for 
any sort of restrictions; no support at all for the partial-
birth abortion (ban), which we said many, many Democrats 
supported, and then the speakers were consistently pro-
abortion.  Kate Michaelman(?) -- it was not shown on prime 
time, but the head of a national abortion rights group did 
talk about abortion and her own abortion.  I think that is 
very, very sad.

<p>

On the other hand, we saw in San Diego a very, 
very strong pro-life platform, very, very compassionate, 
wonderful language; and yet where were the pro-life speakers 
on the platform in San Diego?  We had wonderful heroes.  
Judiciary chairman Henry Hyde, who did chair the platform 
committee -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Republican platform.

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Right, the Republican platform -- he 
did speak at the convention, and he maybe had one line about 
the sanctity of human life.  But he was not able, it was my 
understanding, to give a specifically pro-life speech.  We 
certainly didn't have the president of National Right to 
Life giving any sort of speech, and in fact, it seems like 
the Republicans went out of their way to be tolerant of 
people like Colin Powell and Susan Molinari and other fairly 
prominent pro-abortion Republicans who reminded us of that 
of the platform.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: I think we have to say Governor 
Casey also experienced a repeat of four years ago.  He even 
went to Chicago to wait for the call so that he could go -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Governor Casey, the former governor of Pennsylvania.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: That is right, the former governor 
of Pennsylvania, a pro-life Democrat and really quite a 
sophisticated Democrat, was denied the right again this year 
to speak at his convention, the party that he has supported 
all of his life.  So again, he experienced that.  He went 
even to Chicago this time and waited for a phone call; still 
was not allowed to talk.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It wasn't quite the tolerant thing 
that we heard about in the news, it would seem.

<p>

I would like to thank both of you for sharing your 
stories and thank you even more so for going there to 
encourage the pro-life Democrats that we all know and work 
with.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll bring you more 
information regarding topics affecting you and your family.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we are discussing some solutions
to the current predicament of our education system.  It's
back-to-school time for children and parents across the
country, who face decisions ranging from school choice, or
lack of choice, to how to deal with controversial student
curriculum.

<p>

We will be talking to Congressman Lindsey Graham, 
who has proposed new steps toward education reform, and we 
will also be talking to a man who founded an organization 
which provides less privileged children and their parents 
with school choice.  You won't want to miss hearing what is 
happening in education on tonight's show.

<p>

But first, we will be taking you to an historical 
event that took place just last week.  Catholic cardinals 
and bishops, along with other religious leaders from across 
the country, gathered to lead prayer on the steps of our 
Nation's Capitol.  Their prayers were pleas for the lives of 
unborn children and appeals to our Congress as they vote to 
override the President's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion 
Ban Act, a vote that could come even tomorrow.

<p>

This is very timely because, just hours ago, the 
Clinton Administration successfully pushed the FDA approval 
of the abortion-causing drug, RU 486.  The Family Research 
Council is already targeting this historical decision, and 
we will keep you informed of that decision's consequences.

<p>

You may have caught a glimpse of the powerful day 
of prayer in your newspaper or on your local newscast, but 
we have much more to show you as <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you 
Behind the Headlines.

<p>

[Segments from Prayer for Life at the Capitol, held September 
12, 1996, follow:]

<p>

MS. HELEN ALVARES: We come here today to pray at 
the place where life-and-death decisions are being made by 
lawmakers, decisions which affect the very most defenseless 
among us, the unborn.  We will pray for members of Congress, 
for mothers and fathers tempted to abortion, for all 
children -- born, unborn, nearly born -- for many others who 
are threatened in some way.

<p>

As you know, within a few weeks, the House and the 
Senate will vote on the override of the Presidential veto of 
the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.  We therefore pray for 
members of Congress to act on their obligation to defend 
life and to reject the cruel destruction of infants only 
seconds away from taking their first breath.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL JAMES HICKEY: Brothers and sisters, you 
and I stand at the edge of a new century and a new 
millennium.  Either it will be an era of life or an era of 
death.  Either we will protect life or destroy it.  With all 
our hearts, with all that is within us, we pray this day and 
every day that our nation will choose to protect life, the 
life of the unborn child in the womb, the life of the child 
as he or she is being born, also the life of the frail 
elderly and the terminally ill.

<p>

We ask Almighty God to give us the wisdom to 
reject the culture of death and, instead, to embrace the 
culture of life.  We come here not as political leaders nor 
as lobbyists, but we come as men and women of different 
faiths who are united in prayer and united in a common 
cause, and our cause is life.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL WILLIAM KEELER: Here today are those 
from other churches who support the culture of life.  
Together, we are bound by our support of life and by our 
opposition to partial-birth abortion.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

PASTOR GEORGE ANDERSON: Indeed, men and women of 
faith -- Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, Jewish, Muslim 
people -- are one, are allies, as we stand in defense of 
children and the family.  We stand united against this 
hideous and inhuman abortion procedure.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL BERNARD LAW: We gather on the steps of 
our Nation's Capitol to pray.  Mindful of our obligation to 
the littlest, the weakest, and the most forgotten, we pray. 
Hopeful that those who work in this place will know the 
right and do it, we pray.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL JOSEPH BERNADIN: If you obey the 
commandments of the Lord your God, which I command on you 
this day, by loving the Lord your God, by walking in His 
ways, and by keeping His commandments and His statutes and 
His ordinances, then you shall live.  Therefore, choose 
life, that you and your descendants may live, loving the 
Lord your God, obeying His voice, and cleaving to Him, for 
that means life to you and length of days.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

REV. JEFFREY BROWN: If a man has 100 sheep and 
one of them goes astray, will he not leave the 99 in the 
hills and go in search of the stray?  And if he finds it, 
amen, I say to you, he rejoices more over it than over the 
99 that did not stray.  In just the same way, it is not the 
will of your heavenly Father that one of these little ones 
be lost.

<p>

[Conclusion of segments from Prayer for Life at the Capitol.]

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The sinking test scores of U.S. 
students over the course of the past few years have forced 
parents, teachers, and politicians alike to face a crisis 
which permeates our schools today.  Despite many attempts to 
fix our education system, the harsh reality remains:  poor 
student performance has many underlying causes and no easy 
solutions.

<p>

In 1994 Congress made its own attempt to improve 
student performance by passing legislation called Goals 
2000.  The bill set in place national curriculum standards. 
Controversial from its outset, Goals 2000 added to the 
power of the Department of Education by allowing the Federal 
Government to interfere with school curriculum.  Previously, 
such involvement was prohibited, and without this important 
restriction, parents have almost no voice against decisions 
made by Washington bureaucrats.

<p>

Like most things that come out of Washington, 
Goals 2000 also has a power game attached.  In exchange for 
federal money, school districts must conform to national 
attitudinal and behavioral standards.  These take away the 
emphasis on learning and place it on socialization.  In 
essence, Goals 2000 standards allow conflict resolution 
training and comprehensive sex education to overshadow 
instruction in basic skills like grammar and math, even at 
the elementary school level.

<p>

Goals 2000 proponents claim the program gives 
local parents and teachers important decision-making 
authority.  In fact, the only choice Goals 2000 leaves at 
the local level is whether or not to participate.  Several 
states, including Virginia, New Hampshire, Montana, and 
Alabama, rejected the Goals 2000 money, giving up access to 
the federal tax dollars in exchange for local control of 
schools.  But, whether or not a state participates in Goals 
2000, every taxpayer foots the bill.  And the battle over 
who defines good education rages on.

<p>

The controversy over Goals 2000 brought a recent 
flurry of activity on Capitol Hill.  To clear up confusion 
about some recent governmental decisions regarding Goals 
2000, I am joined by Congressman Lindsey Graham, who just 
this morning introduced a bill that would stop federal 
funding of Goals 2000.

<p>

We are also joined by Jennifer A. Marshall, FRC's 
education policy analyst.  Jennifer keeps families, 
educators, and legislators informed on all the hot education 
issues.

<p>

Welcome, both of you, to the show.

<p>

You know, Congressman, when I came to Washington 
in the 1980s -- I have actually been here now almost 10 
years -- we were going to get rid of the Department of 
Education.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: We're still talking about it, aren't we?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And we're still talking about that.
And then Goals 2000 came up, and so we were just going to 
fix the Department of Education.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But why do you want to get rid of 
Goals 2000 and defund it?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, let's talk about 
what we are trying to do with this legislation.  Goals 2000 
was an idea that came out of the Bush Administration about 
having national standards to compete in a global economy.  
That sounds really good on paper, that we are going to have 
school districts pushing at the 21st century so our kids can 
compete with the Japanese and the Germans.

<p>

The problem is, when you start taking national 
standards and implementing them, the agenda of the 
bureaucracy gets put in place.  And, to be honest with you, 
the NEA owns the Democratic education agenda; they own the 
Department of Education.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The National Education Association.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The teachers' unions.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: The teachers' unions, okay.

<p>

They are a very liberal group.  To deny that is to 
deny the obvious.  It is not a crime to be liberal; I just 
disagree.  If the conservatives take over the White House, 
which we will one day, I really don't believe it is good for 
America to have a conservative agenda coming out of the 
federal Department of Education.  I think these decisions 
need to be made at home.

<p>

So what we are doing is taking the $350 million 
that is allocated for Goals 2000 that would be run through 
the Department of Education and come home in dribbles; we 
are just going to bypass the Department of Education and the 
Federal Government and write the check to the states, who 
will in turn give it to the local school districts, and we 
are going to get the money home as quickly as possible.

<p>

There is a dynamic that has existed for a long 
time.  Six percent of the education funding in America comes 
from Washington.  Fifty percent of the mandates come out of 
Washington, D.C.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So for six pennies on the dollar, 
they are calling all the shots.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, in politics, the 
power is really the power of the purse.  If I can control 
your agenda by telling you what to do through legislation 
and mandates, I own you politically.  If I can tell a county 
council and a city council what they must do to comply with 
federal law, then I have taken a lot of their resources and 
directed how they spend it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: I don't give them the 
money, but I tell them what to do.  The same way in 
education.  If I can control the mandate part of education, 
how you teach, then I own your curriculum, I own you 
politically.  And I don't want to own anybody.  What I want 
to do is free up the parents, the teachers, and the local 
school officials and give them a shot at getting this money 
quickly and let them build a bridge to the 21st century that 
will be built on solid ground.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Jennifer, are there any horror 
stories to come out of what we have seen of Goals 2000 so 
far, or are we just seeing people being asked to be sure 
that fifth graders can do algebra?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, it is certainly not the 
latter, and in fact, with the push for more and more social 
services to be offered in schools, we are seeing tragic 
cases like the one in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, 
where 60 young girls, adolescent girls, were told to strip 
down to their underwear, wait -- scared little girls; some 
were prevented from calling their mothers -- and they then 
proceeded to have genital exams.  That is just horrific, and 
there was no parental warning there.

<p>

This is the kind of thing that happens when 
schools think they play a bigger role in kids' health than 
the parents do.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, I am sure you have 
heard this argument as many times as I have:  Well, the 
reason why we need federal standards is not for the good 
parents that would take their children to the doctor but all 
of those terrible parents out there that wouldn't.  Will 
Goals 2000 get at the liberal straw man of the terrible 
parents abandoning their kids?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: I think what we need to do 
in Washington is get behind labels.  Drug-free schools.  
That's a label that sounds great.  Goals 2000.  It sounds 
like a good program to move the country forward.  Let's look 
at education results over the last 30 years and see if it is 
rational to continue to turn to the Federal Government.

<p>

Since 1965, test scores in this country have 
plummeted.  They have gone literally downhill at a dramatic 
rate, all-time lows.  Dropout rates are up.  Schools are not 
safe to go to anymore.  And what we have realized is that 
every time we increase the power of the Federal Government, 
the best we do is become stagnant.

<p>

So the evidence is in pretty clearly that for the 
last 16 or 17 years, turning to an exclusive federal remedy 
is not working.  We are not improving test scores.  We are 
not enhancing learning.  We are not getting parents more 
involved; they are less involved.

<p>

So let's do something different.  Let's take the 
money that would be spent through federal bureaucracies with 
a federal stamp of approval and free up the resources at the 
local level, give people more money, and let parents and 
teachers and local school officials sit down and design a 
curriculum that they feel good about, that the good parents 
feel good about, and that really addresses the bad parents 
in a local community, because all bad parents are not alike.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, it is interesting.
Education Secretary Riley had this huge news conference 
about six months ago about how we know that if parents are 
involved, children do better, and in fact, the data was 
interesting that even if you had shown up at a PTA meeting, 
your children then were more likely to do well; that parents 
who were involved had children who did better.

<p>

And then we move all the curriculum decisions to 
Washington, D.C.  I mean, what have you seen, Jennifer, in 
terms of involved parents equalling better educated 
children?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, there are mounds and mounds 
of research that say parents are the single most important 
factor in their kids' educational achievement.  It has been 
proven by home schoolers, it has been proven by Christian 
schoolers, public schoolers.  Any environment, parents are 
the key factor.

<p>

So that just calls more and more for the decisions 
being made locally, by parents who care.  You know, the 
Washington bureaucrats -- Secretary Riley, Bill Clinton -- 
don't care more about our kids than we do.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, I think one thing that 
is interesting in some of the debate is the discussion of 
the fact that Bill Clinton and Al Gore have their children 
in private, faith-based schools, as do the majority of the 
Washington elite.  And then you have Goals 2000, on the 
other hand, dictating what your children will learn, even 
though I wouldn't put my child in that school.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Right. Well, let's agree 
on something.  Secretary Riley is from South Carolina; I am 
from South Carolina.  I know he cares about the kids in this 
country.  I am sure President Clinton does.  He cares about 
his daughter, and as a parent, he made a good decision.  He 
tried to put his daughter in the best educational 
environment he could find for her so she would be safe and 
she would learn.  He did what every parent in America should 
do.

<p>

What I am saying is, let's give the parents of 
America some of the resources that would filter through our 
bureaucracy; give it to them directly in conjunction with 
our local school officials and see if they can create an 
environment where they can send their kid to a public school 
or maybe a private school that they feel better about.

<p>

This idea that you can only have compassion if you 
spend money in Washington and you can only trust quality 
coming out of Washington is a dismal failure.  Just look at 
the evidence.  I don't have any children, but I am a 
taxpayer, and one day I hope to have a family.  But I can 
tell you from a taxpayer's point of view, we are spending 
$120 billion cycling through federal bureaucracies, not just 
the Department of Education -- it is only $32 billion -- so 
there is $120 billion being spent through Washington, D.C., 
bureaucracies, and the children and the teachers are getting 
about 26 cents of the dollar.  If you designed a business 
this way, you would go broke in a week.

<p>

So we are trying to get a new formula, what she 
just said.  You don't have to be a rocket scientist or a 
Ph.D. to figure out that the best way to have a quality 
school is have moms and dads showing up at PTA meetings, 
having kids go, with teachers who have the power to teach 
and are not micromanaged from afar.  This is simple, basic 
stuff that served our country well for 180 years.  Only 
since the Great Society have we seen a bottoming out of 
education.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It's interesting, isn't it?  I mean, 
I saw a chart just the other day -- I think it was from the 
Heritage Foundation, another conservative organization -- 
that was saying that they looked at the beginning of the 
Department of Education and tracked test scores with its 
inception and growth, and it was one of those things; it was 
almost an anti-chart, you know, a mirror image of, as the 
federal role has increased, the educational system has done 
much poorer.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, the dropout rates 
are at an all-time high.  The test scores, SAT quantitative 
test scores, have gone down a tremendous amount.  In 1965 
they were about 950.  They have really dropped, and they are 
just stagnant now.

<p>

All the money we spend in Washington and all the 
bureaucracies we have created in Washington have, at best, 
kept us stagnant.  I am looking for a different way.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, has anything good come 
out of Goals 2000?  I mean, you were there to defund it 
today. Is there any good news with that bad news pill?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, everybody says it is 
a voluntary program and it has done a lot but we can't get 
-- well, if it is voluntary, why not just -- you know, 
what's the big deal about getting rid of it?  If there is no 
federal control, why is everybody so dead-set in the NEA and 
other liberals of hanging onto it?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And what do they say to that?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, they just said,
Well, there is no micromanaging.  Well, why not just get rid 
of it?  There is.  Obviously, there is.  That is why they 
are fighting for it.

<p>

Their agenda can never survive at the local level.
You would never have homosexual awareness week in most 
school districts.  The only way you are going to have it is 
to have a power base in Washington, D.C., that mandates 
curriculum that goes the liberal way.  You cannot win these 
wars at the local level.  So if they can consolidate money 
and power in Washington, then they can control the 
curriculum, but only then.

<p>

So what we are trying to do is destroy a breeding 
ground that is going to lead to more federal intervention, 
is going to lead to more NEA-type doctrine, because this is 
surely the first step along a long road of more federal 
involvement.

<p>

Let's nip it in the bud now.  Let's take the money 
back home, send it directly with no carrying charges, and 
see in a few years from now if we have a better school 
system.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We know, Congressman, that you have 
to get back to the Hill.  It's a busy week.  Before you go, 
we have been talking a lot about partial-birth abortion, as 
I am sure you are aware of.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We appreciate your taking this quick 
moment out.  Any word as people are looking -- they are 
saying it might come up tomorrow, might come up next week.
How does that look, Congressman?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, it's a fluid 
situation right now.  Please get on the phones, write 
letters.  Don't send them to my office.  We are going to 
vote to override the veto.  Get involved.  I think this is 
one that we have a shot at winning.  The Catholic Church has 
gotten behind the issue.  There is a real faith-based 
coalition growing out there.

<p>

Pro-choice people voted against this procedure 
because it is so ghastly.  If you look at the facts, if you 
look at exactly what we do to children under this procedure, 
it is a blight on America.  And if we cannot come together 
and stop this, I am really very disappointed in my 
government right now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you, Congressman, for being 
with us. Jennifer, we will see more of you in a moment.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will bring you more 
about America's education standards, and we will introduce 
you to a man who is helping give parents some new choices.  
Please stay with us.

[Segments from Washington Scholarship Fund FUNDay, 
held September 15, 1996, follow:]

<p>

MR. RANDALL BYRNES (Co-Chairman): We feel at the 
Washington Scholarship Fund, when we start these children in 
the programs, their age is kindergarten, they start in 
kindergarten and they go all the way up through the eighth 
grade, and at ages 5 through 14, those are the most 
formative ages in their lives, and we feel as though it is 
important that they get the kind of quality education and 
the nurturing that, unfortunately, they are not getting in 
the public school system.

<p>

So by virtue of having them go to whatever private 
school they deem desirable -- most of them are schools in 
their neighborhoods, Catholic schools and other independent 
schools -- then they can get a good start in life and 
receive the kind of attention and care and discipline and 
value system, as well as the education, that will put them 
in good stead for life.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. ROBERT THOMPSON (Co-Chairman): When we 
started it two and a half or three years ago, the Washington 
Times ran a full-page ad gratis for a couple of days.  Since 
that time, it has been all word of mouth.  We have 225 
children on scholarship, but we have 600 on the waiting 
list.

<p>

What Randy and I consider our main role is to 
figure out a way to raise enough money to take those 600 
kids off the waiting list.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. GEORGE JOCHUM (Board Member): Well, we first 
heard about the Washington Scholarship Fund through a 
friend, and we really liked the concept that you help young 
people get a better education.  What is extraordinary about 
this is it is just not a gift.  The parents, who are less 
affluent than most, have to pay half.  So you feel like you 
are truly making a contribution, not only for the children 
but also for the parents.  The parents are making great 
sacrifices.

<p>

MS. CRIS JOCHUM: And we certainly understand how 
important education is and also understand how important it 
is that the parents are committed to education.  And that is 
what is so great about this program, because the parents are 
as involved as the children are or they couldn't be in the 
program.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. LYNDON BILAL (Recipient Parent): I got the 
<i>Washington Times</i> newspaper on a Saturday evening and went in 
to work, and my concern was how am I going to be able to 
send these children to a school that I would like to send 
them to, which for me it's an Islamic school.  And so I was 
blessed to see that article in the <i>Washington Times</i>, and 
then I immediately filled it out and faxed it in that night.
I have three children that are being sponsored by 
Washington Scholarship Fund, and I have four children in the 
school, but only three of them are being sponsored, but that 
is a tremendous help.

<p>

RECIPIENT PARENT: I found out about the program 
through my aunt at one of the libraries up in Georgetown, 
and I called and applied for the scholarship fund and 
waited, and I got the scholarship.  I have one child.  She 
is 5.  I want her to have a good foundation to start, and I 
think it's the best considering the public school situation 
that is around us.  And she is doing an excellent job, and I 
really, really want to thank the scholarship fund.

<p>

RECIPIENT PARENT: Well, I wanted them to get a 
better education through Saint Augustine.

<p>

RECIPIENT PARENT: It's a little more disciplined 
attitudes, all of that,  It's different, the learning -- I 
don't know, it's more or less like they want to learn.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. THOMPSON: This is my way of trying to give 
something back to the community, and I believe it is the 
best return on a charitable dollar because we are giving 
these young kids an opportunity to get a very good education 
as well as the values that go with that.

<p>

[Conclusion of segments.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As you just witnessed, the 
Washington Scholarship Fund is impacting the lives of 
parents and their children's education.

<p>

With us today is Doug Dewey, the founding 
president of the National Scholarship Center and the 
executive director of the Washington Scholarship Fund.  Also 
with us again is Jennifer A. Marshall, FRC's education 
policy analyst, who brings us education innovators such as 
Doug.

<p>

Welcome very much.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Thank you very much.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Doug, your program is very unique, 
and we are going to hear a lot about it in these next couple 
of minutes.  But one of the key functions of it is to get 
parents involved in their children's education.  Why is 
that?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, as Jennifer said, the evidence 
is just overwhelming that that is the number one indicator 
of success for schooling, and that is no different for low-
income, underprivileged children in inner cities.

<p>

What our program does, it is kind of a tough-love 
scholarship program.  We provide half of the tuition for any 
non-government school that a family wishes to send their 
children to, up to a maximum of $1,500 a year, and the 
parents are responsible to pay the rest.

<p>

You have to understand that the average annual 
income of the parents in our program is $14,000.  So they 
are making an incommensurate sacrifice on behalf of their 
children.  We send the checks to the schools from September 
to June, and they are written out to the mother and to the 
school.  They have to be endorsed by the mother.  That keeps 
them involved, knowing that they have to pay -- some of them 
pay on a weekly basis and, we have even heard, in rolls of 
quarters.  Some of them pay on a monthly basis.  But all of 
them are owners of their education, and they take great 
pride in that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And you have found it's not an 
income-level outcome, but it is an involvement outcome that 
has made a difference?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Oh, definitely. As I say, our average 
income is very low.  But I think if I had to point to a 
single difference of why these people are doing so well -- 
in the private schools in the inner city, regardless of 
whether they are Catholic or Christian or non-denominational 
or non-sectarian, they all have about a 95 to 99 percent 
graduate rate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. Compare that for us, 
Jennifer, quickly, with schools at large.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: I think we are talking about 70s.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So 70 percent national average.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: And about 40 percent in the District 
of Columbia.  And not only that, the children go on to 
college at a rate of about 85 percent, and they complete 
college.

<p>

So they are the children from the same 
neighborhoods, from the same demographic facts, that you 
would look at them and all of those expectations that they 
would not succeed, and yet they do.

<p>

So again, if I had to point to one thing, apart 
from all of the faith and the discipline and the things that 
people talk about that exist in private schools, I think it 
is that ownership of education which comes with paying your 
own tuition.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, then, in a way, you must be 
excited about a recent headline out of New York City where 
the Catholic Church has offered to take the 1,000 children 
at the very lowest end of ability in the schools and put 
them into private school.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Oh, indeed.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you see that as an answer?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: I do. No one knows yet how the 
program there will be structured, but I think it is a 
courageous offer from Cardinal O'Connor to take the bottom, 
I guess they said 5 percent, but we won't know how they are 
going to structure it.  I would hope, and I would advise if 
I were asked, that they include a parental match component 
in their program.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: To get people involved.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: That is right, so that all those 
children, their families are paying something.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to be coming back in a 
moment, Doug, but if you could tell us, are you concerned -- 
and we can talk more -- that as vouchers develop -- and 
there are experiments in Cleveland and around the country -- 
that that is going to mean federal control of the private 
schools that are doing well by the kids you are talking 
about?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, a lot of people have that 
concern; there's just no doubt about it.  Attempts to pass 
vouchers in different jurisdictions around the country have 
been going on for about 15 years now, and with each 
successive version, in order to try to secure passage and 
enactment, we find more and more compromises.  I think this 
is putting more and more conservatives and Christians and 
home schoolers and others on the alert.

<p>

One of the advantages of privately funded vouchers --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Which you have.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: That's right -- is that they sidestep 
this whole controversy because they don't use government 
funds.  And so, of course, they carry none of the risks.  If 
I wanted to regulate the schools in my program, I have no 
power to do so.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to hear more 
about that in just a moment. When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we 
will continue our discussion on education and how parents 
can make the most of available resources.  Please stay with 
us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are discussing some 
alternative solutions to the decline of education standards.
I am joined by Doug Dewey, president of the National 
Scholarship Center and executive director of the Washington 
Scholarship Fund.  Also joining us is Jennifer A. Marshall, 
FRC's education policy analyst.  Welcome back, both of you.

<p>

You know, Jennifer, there is a lot of frustration 
on the part of parents with the role of government, and you 
see a program like this, in a way, doing an end run.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Oh, yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you think about that?  We're 
cutting out the middle man.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, it's wonderful.  You know, we 
get so many questions about what would happen if we 
decreased the federal role in education.  What if we got rid 
of it?  It would be disaster for education.  Well, no, it 
wouldn't.  Things like this would happen.  Things like this 
are happening now.  And they are recapturing education.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: These are success stories, Doug, and 
we are excited to present your story.  How did you guys get 
started?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: I was working, I must confess, for 
Lamar Alexander, helping craft America 2000 -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now Goals 2000.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: -- which became Goals 2000, renamed 
and made worse, to be sure, when I came across a program 
started by a chairman of the Golden Rule Insurance Company, 
Patrick Rooney(?), who is in Indianapolis, Indiana.  He had 
made an attempt to get some vouchers for children in 
Indianapolis from the legislature there, failed, and 
somewhat on the rebound of that, decided, well, he will put 
his own money where his mouth is, and he earmarked 
$1.2 million in 1991, announced it in the radio and the 
newspapers in August, and had 1,000 kids in school that 
September.  Now he is entering his sixth year.

<p>

So I wrote about that while I was at the 
department, got very excited.  You may recall the results of 
the 1992 election.  Well, I was a Bush White House 
appointee, so I needed something to do, even if it wasn't 
gainful employment, and we needed this kind of opportunity 
for children in Washington, D.C.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And how long has this program been operating?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: We are going into our third year now. 
We started with 30 children in 1993 and went up to 100 and 
150.  Now we are at 225 children, and we have 600 children 
on the waiting list.

<p>

Our average grant, what we get for the money, is 
$1,000 for each child, and that sends a child to a private 
school for an entire year.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know what is amazing about that 
is the District of Columbia's cost per child in education is 
the highest in the nation.  I think it is what, $9,000,
Jennifer?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The highest amount of money, $9,000, 
with violence and the drug problem and the dropout rate.  
And for $1,000, one-ninth of the cost, you are going to put 
a child in a safe and effective educational environment.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: That is right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Doesn't money make the difference?  
If we spent more on education, aren't we going to get more?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, I know of one economist in 
California who has done a study which actually shows an 
inverse relationship between spending and achievement.  But 
I do know that for a little bit of money, you can get a lot 
of impact from these programs.

<p.

After Pat Rooney started his program in 1991, we 
had copycat programs in Milwaukee, San Antonio, Atlanta, and 
now they have spread.  By 1996, right now, we have 28 
programs in 27 jurisdictions around the country, with about 
10,000 low-income children all going to private schools of 
their choosing -- Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Catholic, every 
variety -- and I think that is very exciting and very 
promising.

<p>

And for those who don't like publicly funded 
vouchers, either for conservative reasons or for liberal 
reasons, as it were, this is a great alternative.  This is 
something everybody can be involved in.  On our board we 
have Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and William Bennett as 
our two honorary co-chairmen.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Two different political ends.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Absolutely. And we can all agree, 
low-income parents who want this opportunity for their 
children, it is an appropriate thing for the private sector 
to step in and give them a shot at that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Jennifer, what has been the impact 
as programs like this have sprung up nationwide?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, they are the perfect example 
of what can be done and what is done by parents, by 
concerned neighborhood members, who want kids to have good 
education.

<p>

I think this is such a good example, and it is 
great to bring up in our legislative battles here, because 
there is such a mind-set in this beltway that problems can 
only be solved here, and if we don't do it here, those poor 
kids will just not get an education.  It is simply not true. 
There are parents, there are community members who care 
dearly about this and will provide.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, the District of Columbia 
is a great case study.  Even recently in the political 
realm, I have heard some criticism from one political camp 
to another, you know, if liberalism was so great, why wasn't 
the District doing better?  And it's very sad the way the 
District is often the bad example, and it is unfortunate.

<p>

How are the children doing, though, in your 
program?  How are they faring individually?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, they are doing remarkably well. 
We have about an 85 percent retaining rate, or I guess a 15 
percent attrition rate.  Five percent of that are just 
people that have moved to Prince George's County or another 
county outside of Washington.  We only serve Washington 
children for now.  So I think they are doing extraordinarily 
well.

<p>

We had one child at Saint Augustine School who was 
new to private school, and they were able to get a grant 
from us, and she became valedictorian and is going to attend 
one of the premier Catholic prep schools next year, or this 
year she is just starting.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Wow! That's great.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: We have another boy that we know who 
just got academic prize of the year, and he was also 
formerly in a government school.  So we know that we've got 
not only some superstars but just the fact that they are 
staying in there, that they are having to make an enormous 
discipline adjustment from really very little requirement of 
being disciplined in the government schools to having to sit 
still, not speak out, never fight.  There is a pretty 
dramatic difference between these schools.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: How are the children in the 
neighborhood and the families in the neighborhood responding 
as some of these children leave, going to different schools, 
and certainly having a different academic experience?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Oh, that is an outstanding question, 
because I think -- and, again, I don't have a RAND study 
behind me on this so I can only say anecdotally -- I know 
that this program comes home with the child and has an 
effect in the neighborhood.  Mothers will call me and say 
how proud they are that their boy comes home in a uniform.
They tell their friends that they are paying for their 
children's education now; their boy is in private school, or 
their girl.  And then I get neighbors calling me saying, "I 
spoke to my neighbor who is doing this.  I want this for my 
child, too."

<p>

So this is real self-esteem, not the bogus 
injected kind that we sometimes hear about.  And so I think 
it has a great spillover effect to get people charged.

<p>

The other thing it is doing occasionally is it is 
bringing families that are broken apart back together.  
Grandmothers help out, sisters, and estranged fathers come 
back to help pay that tuition.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to hear more 
about private responses to public education.  More about 
your family's options when it comes to education and a 
special report from the Family Research Council.  Please 
stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are talking to some 
movers and shakers in the world of education.  With us are 
Doug Dewey and Jennifer A. Marshall.

<p>

Jennifer, you wrote about Doug's outstanding 
scholarship program in a really special report, the <i>Moms and
Dads' School Survival Guide</i>. We at the Family Research 
Council have been concerned about education for quite a 
while.  People may remember that Gary Bauer was Under 
Secretary of Education with Bill Bennett, one of your board 
members.

<p>

Jennifer, why did you write this publication?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, we hear maybe more than any 
other issue from parents and families about education, and 
we hope that this booklet will be just about everything you 
need to know about schooling and education and the concerns 
you should have.

<p>

One of the things you should know is that you have 
some options, and so we have included the listing of the 
private scholarship programs across the country.  You will 
find it in there, so if anybody is interested across the 
country, they can look to that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: If you would like to hear more about 
Doug's program or programs available in your area, you are 
going to want to get one of these.  And, Jennifer, thanks 
for putting it together.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Sure.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What kinds of problems are people 
faced with in the education system that this might be of 
assistance to them?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: I would say the biggest problem -- 
just an overarching summary of it -- is that schools are 
moving more and more into the realms that families have 
filled for years and that are rightfully the role of 
families.  So we have a section in there on parental rights. 
We also have a discussion of current education trends, like 
outcome-based education and Goals 2000, easily 
understandable articles so that parents can be conversant in 
these issues, fight them in their schools.

<p>

We also have a section on education jargon that 
defines these terms that are just batted back and forth 
between education bureaucrats.

<p>

We have another section that describes students' 
religious freedoms in the public schools.  That is an 
important and very misunderstood area.  Many students could 
be exercising much more religious expression and religious 
freedom than they already are.

<p>

So we want students and families to know that and 
then to know about the options that they have if the public 
schools just aren't working for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Doug, as you are working 
with people often in the inner city, one of the things that 
we hear anecdotally, and I wonder if you agree, is that 
people are just intimidated to talk to school educators, 
sort of the tyranny of complexity.  How do I talk, what do I 
say? Will anybody even listen to me?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Yes. I would even go further and 
compare it to a kind of almost religious-type loyalty that a 
lot of parents that I deal with feel they should have for 
their public schools, their government schools, that they 
are not pleased with, clearly.  They are not happy.  They 
don't like their child failing and getting beaten up, and 
sometimes they want to tell me, "Well, the school's okay and 
all" -- they don't want to really confess how bad they 
really think the school is -- "but I just want to have more 
challenge or more foreign languages."  And, clearly, that is 
not at the forefront of their concern as I talk to them 
more.  So I do detect this from the parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We get a lot of calls, Jennifer, at 
Family Research Council.  What are sort of the top two, 
three, four calls that you get about education that we have 
really tried hard to work with here?

<p>

MR. MARSHALL: A lot of people are concerned about 
the content of their kids' curriculum, and this goes in all 
different directions, but sometimes it is just morbid, 
violent, horrible, dark stories that they are reading in 
literature; or in math they are simply not learning their 
times tables; or in reading they are in third grade and they 
don't know how to read yet because they are simply bypassing 
the simple method of phonics.

<p>

So many problems like that, then also problems 
where the school is simply not recognizing parents' rightful 
role in their children's lives and shutting them out of the 
educational process.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When people have come to you, Doug, 
saying, "I want to get my children out of public school, 
government-run schools, to private schools," what are the 
reasons they give you?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, they give the whole gamut, from 
academics to discipline to wanting values taught to their 
children.  Most of the schools that we have are Catholic 
participating in our program because those are the most 
plentiful in the cities, but only a small minority of the 
families that are going to those Catholic schools are 
Catholic themselves.  So they want something that is usually 
Christian, but they want values, they want character.  They 
think that is important.

<p>

And they also want a greater responsiveness from 
the school, which they do not tend to get, I think, and that 
is probably the most common thing.  They say that I just 
can't make a difference.  There is nothing I can do.  I try. 
That's a word I hear all the time, that expression.  I 
tried but nothing happened, so I now feel I have to have 
this other option.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now, as a person that helped work on 
Goals 2000 -- and we are not going to hold that against you 
too much --

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That was supposed to bring values 
into the classroom.  We are going to have the goal of 
values.  Why hasn't that worked?  Jennifer?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Maybe Jennifer should answer that.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: I say simply that they are building 
bricks without straw.  There is not a solid basis, a 
consensus, about what these values even are.  Those are the 
solid virtues that should be taught in the home and clearly 
agreed upon among family members.

<p>

The public school, in trying to be accommodating 
to all different views, simply cannot even come up with the 
values that they want to teach, so they are not going to be 
successful in teaching them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Doug, we have about a minute left, 
and I wanted to give you the last word.  As you look at the 
lives of the children in your program, why do you think this 
kind of endeavor is the way to go?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, I think just hearing what 
Jennifer was saying about having the values being taught at 
home, and when people do send their child to a school, they 
want to have that school agreeing with their most basic 
values.  Whether they be Catholics or Muslims or whatever it 
is, they don't want to be in a kind of tug-of-war for the 
minds and hearts of their children.

<p>

What this program allows is for those parents who 
want something for their children, who have at least one 
person in their life that is crazy about them and is willing 
to sacrifice for them, this gives them a chance.  It's a ray 
of hope for the whole nation when we see 10,000 very low-
income children in very disadvantaged circumstances who are 
taking charge of their education in its entirety -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And going forward.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: That's right, and succeeding.  And I 
think that is a bright hope and a good sign.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thanks so much for being with us, 
both of you.  When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll bring you 
more information regarding issues affecting you and your 
family.  Hope you'll write us, and stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
The 104th Congress should close this week, so tonight
<i>Straight Talk</i> is discussing some of the historic and 
controversial issues that caught the attention of those both 
on Capitol Hill and in homes across America.  These issues 
ranged from life to teen drug use to welfare reform to 
parental rights.

<p>

Tonight's guests worked consistently with our 
Senators and Congressman, dispensing crucial research 
information to ensure that the best arguments supporting 
pro-family viewpoints were heard.  You won't want to miss 
this key overview of your 104th Congress.

<p>

But first, we are taking you to an event which 
included some of the most prominent faith and family leaders 
in America today. They gathered in Senate majority leader 
Trent Lott's office to speak for life.  Protestant, 
Catholic, and Jewish voices blended as they urged Senators 
to override Bill Clinton's veto of the Partial-Birth 
Abortion Ban Act. This act would have protected viable 
children killed viciously moments from birth with a stab to 
the base of the skull.

<p>

The House voted to overturn President Clinton's 
veto.  After powerful debate, the Senate did not.  As you 
hear these leaders speak, you will understand why the fight 
for life is so intense and urgent.  And it's not about 
politics; it's about the kind of people we are.  Let's all 
take a look Behind the Headlines.

<p>

<p>

[Segments from the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban
Press Conference held September 26, 1996, follow:]

<p>

SENATOR TRENT LOTT: We have a great delegation of 
leaders here in this room that are going to make some 
comments on the vote that we are going to have today on 
overriding the President's veto of the Partial-Birth 
Abortion Ban.  This was a tragic mistake by the President, 
because this is a horrible, tragic procedure.

<p>

We are going to have this vote in the Senate this 
afternoon at 3:30, after continued debate this morning and 
about an hour and a half for closing debate, and then we 
will have a vote that will tell us a lot about the 
conscience of America.

<p>

This is not a regional issue.  This is not an 
issue that is affected by sex or race or by philosophy or by 
party.  This should be a vote of the heart and conscience.  
This horrible procedure is not rare, and it is murder of the 
worst kind.

<p>

We are not interested in this as a political 
issue.  We are interested in this because it is absolutely 
the right thing to do, and that is to override this veto.

<p>

So I am very pleased to be here with this 
distinguished delegation.  I want to thank them for taking 
the time to be here with us to support our effort to do the 
right thing in ending this procedure.

<p>

I want to thank especially Rick Santorum, a great 
Senator from Pennsylvania, that has taken this to heart and 
has taken it across america.  He has changed this debate.  
His efforts had an impact on the tremendous veto override 
vote in the House and are having (an impact on the) vote in 
the Senate, but more importantly, it is having an effect on 
people's minds and hearts all across America.  Thank you, 
Rick Santorum, for your work.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

SENATOR DON NICKLES: We need to recognize that we 
have laws in the land that protect endangered species, and 
if people kill the unborn of endangered species, they can be 
fined up to $50,000; they would be imprisoned for a year.  
And yet this procedure happens, and as Senator Lott 
mentioned, it is not rare.  It happens thousands of times, 
not a few times, not a couple of times.  It happens 
thousands of times across the country.

<p>

And, also, I will just mention that medical 
professionals have said it is never necessary.  President 
Clinton was wrong, maybe had wrong information, but it is 
never, never necessary for the health of the mother or to 
protect her fertility.  We have had people make that 
statement from respected professionals, C. Everett Koop and 
others, and this really is a vote about life and death.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL ANTHONY BEVILACQUA: This vote is 
critical for the preservation of this Nation, of our 
civilization.  As you have heard, partial-birth abortion is 
four-fifths birth and one-fifth abortion.  The child is but 
a few seconds, a few inches, away from full birth.  That 
means it is only a few seconds, a few inches, away from 
being legal infanticide.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

DR. JAMES DOBSON: You may remember in the 1980s a 
little girl named Jessica, a little toddler, fell down a 
well in Midland, Texas, and was trapped there, and a frantic 
effort to get her out began.  As I recall, for nearly 80 
hours they worked to get that little girl out.

<p>

The entire country held its breath while they 
struggled to save the life of this child, and I wept when I 
saw that child come out of that hole in the ground, and so 
did so many others.  Why?  Because of the worth of a single 
child, one child worth more than the possessions of the 
entire world in our viewpoint.

<p>

We are talking here not about one child; we are 
talking about what we now know to be thousands and thousands 
of children.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. CHARLES COLSON: -- and as one of the last 
survivors of Watergate, I have to tell you that I reflect 
back on that now and realize that that was a defining moment 
in the country's history because we decided as a people we 
were not going to suffer unrighteousness in high places.
And so this Nation rose up against that, and the question is 
whether, 20-some years later, we have that same moral 
indignation to rise up again against unrighteousness of the 
most horrid kind imaginable.

<p>

For me, as a Christian, I would have to say this 
with a heavy heart, but I believe if this veto is not 
overridden, that this Nation will be sanctioning 
infanticide, and a nation which sanctions infanticide is no 
better morally than China, no better morally than Nazi 
Germany was during the 1930s.

<p>

Those of us who are believing Christians, who put 
their first allegiance in the God of our fathers and Jesus 
Christ, could no longer, I believe, lend moral support to a 
government that had lost its moral legitimacy.  I think that 
issue is that serious today.

<p>

I am one who is praying for President Clinton, 
that even as he comes up here to the Capitol, his conscience 
will be stricken, he will realize that he was misinformed, 
change his opinion, and let the Nation rise up and say, 
"This is enough; we are not going to do this."

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

RABBI DANIEL LAPIN: The men and women that make 
up the body of the Jewish community understand that this 
issue has absolutely nothing to do with reproductive rights, 
but it has everything to do with the ongoing process of 
coarsening and vulgarizing American society.  This is 
something that must be stopped if we are not to descend into 
a horrifying and dark abyss.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. RICHARD LAND:  We face a situation where, in 
one operating theater, the doctors and the nurses are 
laboring heroically to save a baby's life moments from 
birth, and in the very next operating theater, they are 
laboring in some cases physically, holding the baby's head 
inside the mother's body until they can execute the child.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. KAY COLE JAMES: Never in my wildest dreams 
did I ever think that we would get to the point in this 
discussion, in this dialogue in America, where the extremist 
elements of the pro-choice movement would push the envelope 
so far that we are not even debating anymore whether it is 
human life; we know in fact that it is a human being.  It is 
a child.

<p>

And now we have taken this debate to the point 
that we actually have to stand here before the American 
people and plead with them that we as a Nation are not going 
to sit back and tolerate having children come down the birth 
canal and have a physician actually insert scissors in a 
very painful procedure that kills a child.

<p>

We are not talking in esoteric terms anymore, 
ladies and gentlemen.  We actually have to be here today to 
say we are talking about children, and they know it.  But 
somehow, somehow, the right to choose has been elevated over 
the right to life.

<p>

In a free and civilized society, there are some 
things about which there ought not to be a choice, and 
killing children as they come down the birth canal is one of 
them.

<p>

I feel like I am in a surreal environment that in 
America today, we have to debate that issue.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MRS. BEVERLY LA HAYE: It was Dr. James 
McMahon(?), who was one of the pioneers of the partial-birth 
abortion procedure, who said after he saw what was 
happening, before the procedure, he said, "Gee, I wish this 
baby could be adopted."

<p>

And why not? Why not let these babies live and 
then let somebody adopt them who could love them and give 
them life, rather than end their life just seconds before 
they have that opportunity?

<p>

If the President truly supports adoption, I 
challenge him to withdraw his veto and to say, "Let's adopt 
these babies and give them a chance to live."

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. WANDA FRANZ: One of the statements that is 
frequently made is that this procedure is only done under 
extreme cases, for cases in which the child is severely 
deformed or has a major medical problem.  However, 
Dr. Martin Haskell, who pioneered the procedure and has 
performed more than 1,000 of these procedures, has stated 
himself that 80 percent of the partial-birth abortions he 
does are purely elective.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BOB DUGAN: Worst of all, the partial-birth 
abortion technique snuffs out the life of a child who is 
literally a somersault away from taking its first breath.  
How can God bless America if we allow this moral outrage to 
become the practice in our land?

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER: Every once in a while, a great nation 
is forced to deal with a great issue, with a defining issue 
that says something about who it is, what it is about, 
issues of race, of war, and of life.

<p>

This is one of those defining moments.  This 
moment says something about who we are as a free people.  
The founding fathers said this was a shining city upon a 
hill.  The question in 1996 is open:  Are we still a shining 
city upon a hill?

<p>

Even if this vote is lost today, the issue will 
never go away.  It will stick in our throat.  We are better 
than this.  We are a better people than this.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
discuss the consequences of the Senate's vote on partial-birth 
abortion.  Please stay turned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The battle between life and so-called 
choice, now spanning decades, continued most recently 
with partial-birth abortion.  Our guests tonight will 
discuss the implications of votes regarding such life 
issues.

<p>

Here tonight are three members of the Family 
Research Council's Government Relations Department.  I am 
joined by Marty Dannenfelser, assistant to the president for 
government relations; Jacqueline Halbig, congressional 
liaison; and Loralei Gilliam, legislative assistant.  All of 
you, welcome again to the show.

<p>

As you know, we are taking a look at some of the 
most significant votes that we have had, and partial birth, 
Marty, certainly was very powerful and most recent.  What do 
you see as the implications of this vote, which ultimately 
did not prevail, even though there were majorities in the 
House and the Senate?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, there were overwhelming 
majorities, particularly in the House, and increasing 
majorities in the Senate.  We went from 54 votes in the 
Senate to effectively 59, despite the 57 votes that were on 
the roll call, and many Senators who did vote against the 
override, I think, were very uncomfortable with that, 
knowing that it was a very unpopular position with the 
public.

<p>

So I think we are going to see further movement on 
that, and we got a two-thirds majority in the House on every 
occasion when the vote came up.  So I think that there is a 
lot of potential for this in the new Congress.  Congressman 
Charles Canady, the chairman of the Constitution 
Subcommittee in the House, has already indicated that he 
will be bringing this up again in the 105th Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems like partial-birth abortion 
gave us an opportunity that we never had before to really 
talk about what happens in an abortion itself.  And so you 
have here late-term abortions, often viable children, 
healthy children, a scissors stabbed in the base of the 
skull, brain tissue vacuumed out, and the public 
overwhelmingly, as they become aware of it, saying this is 
horrendous.  I think it was something like 75 percent of 
people thought abortion only happened in cases of rape, 
incest, life of the mother, and then in the first trimester.

<p>

Do you think that partial birth has any positive 
implications in terms of its educational opportunities?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: As you noted, it really does 
cause people to focus on the reality of abortion.  In the 
past we have had so much discussion about euphemisms:  a 
woman's right to choose, keep the government out, and all 
these types of things.  And this really is very stark.  Most 
people don't realize that late-term abortions are allowed in 
this country, that they are allowed for any reason, and 
particularly this, where the baby is in the process of being 
born, I think is shocking to many people when they find out 
that this sort of thing is allowed in our country.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems sometimes like House and 
Senate members are locked into a position before they come.  
They run on a certain platform and then they come and kind 
of vote knee-jerk.  Did this issue help people break out of 
molds?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: I think so. You saw people 
like Jim Moran of Virginia, Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, 
people like that, who is the nephew of Ted Kennedy, and when 
you see people like that starting to vote for this, some 
other people who had some pretty hard-line pro-abortion 
positions, it does give them the capacity to say, "This is 
different."  Many of them said, "Well, this was more like 
infanticide than abortion," which in many respects it was.
So it does give them an opportunity to finally cast a vote 
in favor of protecting life.  So that is a step, and 
hopefully, we will get them to look at other forms of 
abortion are just as heinous.

<p>

I think the analogy to what happened in England 
with the slave trade is something that is very instructive.  
William Wilberforce gradually outlawed the different methods 
of bringing the slaves on the boats, and so on, and when he 
forced people to focus on what was going on, how people were 
being held in bondage and treated very shabbily, they 
gradually said no, we can't allow that, and then no, we 
can't allow this other action.  And if people start saying, 
well, we can't allow partial-birth abortion, and then we 
can't allow the dismemberment of children, or we can't allow 
salt-poisoning of children, then perhaps they will start to 
really take a harder look at this abortion issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, that's fantastic.

<p>

Loralei, I know there were some other victories 
for us on the pro-life front.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tell us a little.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: In the Labor, Health and Human 
Services appropriations bill, we were successful with 
looking at the education process of doctors.  The ACGME, 
which is the Accreditation Council for (Graduate) Medical 
Education, looked at training of abortion as a procedure for 
doctors.

<p>

Senator Coats took the lead on this in the Senate, 
and we were successful in keeping that in to where the 
doctors are not required or the medical schools are not 
required to learn how to perform abortions if they so 
choose.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And again, taxpayer funding was 
involved.  It was amazing to me, Marty, when we were talking 
earlier about the kinds of issues, how many involved 
taxpayer funding issues. Could you go through a couple of 
those for us?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, we renewed some things 
that had been lost in the last Congress.  When President 
Clinton first came in, he had veto threats on a number of 
bills where there had been longstanding restrictions, such 
as with the federal employees' health insurance programs, 
and that restriction, which had been in place for eight 
years, was lost in the last Congress; it was restored in 
this Congress.

<p>

On his third day in office, on the anniversary of 
<i>Roe v. Wade</i> in 1993, he handed down five executive 
memorandums on different abortion policies, one of them 
being a mandate to allow abortions in the military 
hospitals.  Now Congress has legislatively overturned that.

<p>

The District of Columbia prohibition on abortion 
on demand, funding for that, was lost in the last Congress, 
and it was renewed again in this Congress, and we did, of 
course, maintain the Hyde amendment, and as Loralei 
mentioned, the accreditation now so that these colleges that 
train doctors will not be threatened with the loss of 
federal funds if they refuse to be a party to the training 
of abortion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I was really struck by one of the 
things that happened.  We don't often think about human 
research as happening in America.  You think of that as 
being some kind of Nazi phenomenon.  But we actually had to 
have legislation related to human embryo research, the 
creating of human beings for research purposes.

<p>

Loralei, what happened on that?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: We were successful in keeping embryo 
research from being funded.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It doesn't really allow -- they can 
still do some private funding, I guess, Marty, but they 
don't have to --

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: In federally funded programs, 
yes, they cannot be creating live human embryos for the 
purpose of experimentation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Which is ironic, because then in 
private programs they can, can they not, go ahead and use 
human beings for the purpose of research?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes. There is some scary stuff 
that is going on out there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Is there any indication that if 
federal funds would be cut off we might see a little less 
human embryo research?  Although it is almost gruesome to 
think that it is happening.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: There might be a little bit, 
but it is important for the Federal Government to at least 
go on record and set the standard that this sort of thing is 
inappropriate, because when it gets federal sanction, it 
makes it that much more credible and acceptable throughout 
the entire society.  So it is an important step to say that 
that type of experimentation on living human beings is 
unacceptable.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We also took a look at funding in 
this session of Congress on international funding of 
abortion, and ironically, we might not have taxpayer-funded 
abortion in the United States, but internationally, that is 
not the case.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: No. You have a situation where 
the under secretary -- I guess his name is Tim Wirth(?) -- 
at the State Department is such a zealot in this area that 
he has a ball in the shape of a globe in his office where he 
keeps condoms, and the whole program has been promoted, and 
they have worked through the United Nations to promote this 
whole agenda.  We have managed to keep the funding in check 
because there are no longer the constraints on giving money 
to organizations that promote abortion as a method of family 
planning.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. When <i>Straight Talk</i>
returns, we will bring you more about America's fight for 
family issues within the halls of Congress.  Stay tuned.

<p>

ROBERT WOODSON: -- but use the considerable 
political and economic strength of churches and churchgoers 
and others to remove the kind of government barriers that 
prohibit faith-based organizations from properly serving 
their own peers.

<p>

REV. RONALD MOORE: -- every individual can find 
work, and whenever they find work, there is a sense of 
dignity.  It develops dignity, it develops accountability, 
it develops responsibility, and their moral and their 
ethical lives are changed, and I'm not talking about 
temporary change; we're talking about a permanent change.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As you just witnessed, some very 
controversial topics, such as immigration, affirmative 
action, and welfare reform activated the American public.  
With me to discuss some of those issues are the finest 
government relations staff in town, Family Research 
Council's Marty Dannenfelser, Jacqueline Halbig, and Loralei 
Gilliam.  Welcome back.

<p>

Marty, you all worked a lot on welfare reform, and 
there were some interesting -- people don't often think of 
Family Research Council as being involved in immigration 
policy, but there were a couple of things that caught our 
eye. What happened on these things?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, they were areas where we 
had some success in a scale-backed form from where we 
started. The welfare area, we wanted to tackle the issue of 
illegitimacy in the area of caps, and so on, and that did 
not survive.  There was a bill that passed the Congress and 
was vetoed by the President that included those types of 
provisions.

<p>

But the ultimate legislation that passed really 
ended the federal entitlement but left things largely to the 
states to design it, and even there, there were waivers that 
were still in place that are still potentially problematic.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Could you tell us a little bit more 
about caps, Jacqueline?  We were taking a look at different 
provisions. What were we hoping for when we got started?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Well, we had pretty strong, high 
hopes, and a lot of those did not prevail, as Marty noted.
But the family caps were designed to stop the process of 
illegitimate births in families, that women kept having 
children out of wedlock and seemingly were rewarded for that 
by increased funding, and so we were trying to cap their 
funding and not allow them to get increased funding for each 
additional child that they had out of wedlock.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But was that a desire -- I mean, it 
almost sounds kind of cold, and I ask this as a straw man 
setup question.  I mean, why caps?  Was that the most 
compassionate answer, and why would it have been?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: It seemed to work as far as a few 
experiments that took place.  One was in New Jersey, and it 
seemed to have the positive effect of not rewarding a 
negative action.  If you don't reward a negative action, 
then they won't continue to do that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Ultimately, what was the best thing, 
Marty, that came out of welfare reform?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think the idea that it 
did end the federal entitlement, and that is probably the 
most significant thing, and it gives much more power back to 
the states.  There have been many states that have been 
taking action that they have to keep coming on bended knee 
to the Department of Health and Human Services looking for 
waivers, and now they pretty much are on their own to design 
these programs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Waivers would be like federal 
permission to try an experiment, to do something different.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  Yes, to get a waiver from the 
law dealing with Medicaid funding or some other proposal in 
the welfare area.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And so, for the first time, we are 
saying, look, we are not going to automatically give money 
if these situations exist; we are going to try to be smart 
about it. And we can actually do some experiments to try to 
change our situation?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: The idea is to try to phase it 
out at the federal level over a five-year period and then 
allow the states to put stronger work requirements and other 
things in the area of illegitimacy.  One of the areas of 
controversy with the family cap was the question of would 
that lead to increased abortions, and what they resolved was 
to say that states could get an increase if they were able 
to bring down their illegitimacy rate without increasing the 
rate of abortion.  So that was the compromise that was 
reached among people in the pro-family community who had 
some concerns in this area.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One of the things that was 
interesting this year, Gary Bauer testified on Capitol Hill 
-- President of Family Research Council -- about the 
persecution of Christians as an immigration issue.  I mean, 
we certainly have not really heard much about this in the 
past.

<p>

We have about a minute left, Loralei.  Could you 
tell us a little bit about the status of that?  What is 
happening?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: The immigration reform bill just 
went through and was passed and signed, and what it looked 
at is providing asylum.  We ran into women that were trying 
to find asylum here in the United States coming from China, 
having to deal with the human rights violations in their 
home countries.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Like forced abortion?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Forced abortion and wanting to get 
out of their situations, and unfortunately, the 
administration was not very supportive of these women, and 
this new immigration reform looks at providing asylum for 
people that are trying to escape human rights violations.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Interesting, and I know in the 
Sudan, crucifixion of Christians, and we will probably hear 
more about this in the next session of Congress; it just got 
started.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will continue our 
discussion on pro-family issues that were debated among 
Congressmen and Senators in the 104th Congress.  Please stay 
with us.

[Segment from PRIDE press conference on drug abuse 
prevention held September 26, 1996, follows:]

<p>

GENTLEMAN: Today marks the fifth straight year 
that we have come before you to announce that teen drug use 
is rising.  In fact, for every illicit drug and tobacco, 
drug use by students, mostly ages 11 through 18, is at the 
highest level PRIDE has ever recorded.  More students are 
using more drugs more frequently, and their use is more hard 
core than we have seen in nine years.

<p>

[Segment from Parental Rights and Responsibilities 
Act staff briefing held June 25, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. PAUL TUCKER: We sent our child to school one 
day with all the expectations that she is going to be going 
to school and there will be no problem, and she was informed 
that she had to go down for a physical examination.  Well, 
she thought, no problem, because my daughter does go to camp 
every summer; we do have physicals every summer for our 
children, and we do have the paperwork filled out and we 
hand that in.

<p>

My daughter decided to leave class early to go 
down to the office to explain to these nurses that she had 
the paperwork filled out, that she really didn't need a 
physical.  When she informed the nurses that she had done 
so, the nurse said, "We have lost your paperwork; you have 
to have the physical."

<p>

My daughter said, "But I already had one."  They 
said, "Well, it's too bad; you have to have one, anyway."
She said, "Well, let me call my mother."  They said, "No.
It doesn't matter what your parents think.  You are going to 
have this physical, anyway.  So it wouldn't matter what your 
mom said."

<p>

[Segments concluded.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Issues such as parental rights and 
teen drug use cut to the heart of families this year, and 
with me tonight are those who ensure factual information 
regarding these issues is provided to those making key 
decisions on Capitol Hill.

<p>

From Family Research Council, I am joined by Marty 
Dannenfelser, Jacqueline Halbig, and Loralei Gilliam.
Welcome, all, back to the show.

<p>

Jacqueline, you were tracking some of the parental 
rights issues.  What happened that affected parents and the 
way in which they make decisions for their families?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Well, increasingly, we have just seen 
a large usurpation of parental rights in the just regular 
decisions in bringing up their children, like medical 
decisions, educational decisions, like educational choice, 
and just religious decisions.  A lot of ground has been lost 
to the state.

<p>

But this year we worked hard, as our viewers just 
saw, with Paul Tucker.  He had an incredible case where his 
child was brought in and had a gynecological exam, you know, 
for the whole world to see.  She felt very violated, 
obviously, and her parents felt like they had no recourse.

<p>

This is the Parental Rights and Responsibilities 
Act.  This is something that this bill would address.  So we 
are hopeful for next Congress as far as pursuing that 
further.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think what is interesting about 
that was not only did they give these children gynecological 
exams without parental notification or consent -- 

<p>

MS. HALBIG: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  -- when they were confronted, you 
would think the school would be embarrassed and apologize, 
and they said, "Hey, we have a right, because bad parents 
might be out there."

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And they were actually coming to legal loggerheads.

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Right. I mean, whose children are 
they, parents' or the government's?  Apparently, the 
government thinks that those children belong to them, and 
they have acted in such a way.

<p>

The FDA has --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Federal Food and Drug Administration.

<p>

MS. HALBIG: -- thank you -- has just also done 
something that was egregious, or we have just found out 
about it, anyway.  There has been a lady who has been making 
these home drug-testing kits so that parents could test 
their children for drugs.  What in the world is wrong with 
that? That's their right.

<p>

Well, the FDA doesn't seem to think so.  They are 
classifying these drug-testing kits, which include two urine 
sample cups and a label to send it to a lab, they are saying 
that these are a class III medical device, which is the same 
thing as a pacemaker.  Not quite.  It is not on the same 
grounds at all.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A little plastic cup with a lid is --

<p>

MS. HALBIG: It's not quite a pacemaker, and that 
is what they are saying, so this woman who has been peddling 
these drug-testing kits has now come under fire from the FDA 
as if she has really violated the law.  So she is in danger 
of going to prison because she wants to allow parents to 
have the right to test their children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. Who are some of the 
groups that have been opposed to parental rights?  You would 
think everyone would be in favor of that.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, the National Education 
Association is one of the leading ones, and many other self-
styled child advocacy groups in the liberal community.  But 
the National Education Association, particularly in the area 
of education, they don't want parents to have any more say 
in curriculums or anything like that, so they have raised 
all kinds of horror stories about how any kind of parental 
authority is going to disrupt the classroom.

<p>

So that has been a real problem, and they have 
been an obstacle in many areas of providing school choice, 
cutting back on government mandates through the Goals 2000 
program, and so on.  So we see them rear their heads at a 
lot of turns along the way in the pro-family area.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think it has been interesting, 
too, to see what happened in pornography in the last year.
We have certainly seen some victories in pornography. But 
you look at the Internet, where children can get pornography 
easily, or have been able to, and in an attempt to restrict 
that through the telecom bill, where we were successful, the 
ACLU and others jump in, "Children need pornography," 
apparently.  And so that is a speech issue.

<p>

What else has happened on pornography?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, you run into these on-line 
companies that don't like the restrictions, as well, 
and the Microsofts, and they don't like any restrictions in 
the computer area.  So you do run into this libertarian 
group that has strong objections, and we have seen even 
within the conservative community that you run into a few 
people who have those problems.

<p>

But we have made good headway.  When people 
understand what this does to children and what kind of stuff 
is available to children, they do recoil at it, and many 
people do acknowledge that something has to be done.  The 
Senate voted 84 to 16 to pass this telecom restriction, the 
porn-on-the-internet restriction.

<p>

We had another success on getting the pornography 
out of the military as far as the commissaries on military 
bases, that the government should no longer be subsidizing 
that.  So there has been some movement in this area when 
people realize the detrimental effects this has on families.

<p>

MS. HALBIG: There is an additional success that 
just got passed, an amendment tacked onto the omnibus bill, 
which was something that Senator Hatch's staff was able to 
do.  It is an additional protection against child 
pornography on the internet.  It is computer verification -- 
when they take computer pieces of children and splice them 
together to make a whole child, traditionally, those things 
have not been considered real children so that they have 
gotten away with that kind of pornography.  But now they 
won't be able to since this has been amended.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Loralei, you work with our citizen 
action network a lot.  You are a computer guru, and tracking 
what people have to say about these things.  What is the 
constituent action network response to all these computer 
porn issues and some of the child issues that have come up?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: The initial reaction is disbelief.
So many families are just getting onto the 
internet/cyberspace activities and buying their new home 
computers and are thrilled with the new tools that it is 
going to provide.  And then they are excited to see their 
kids surfing the internet sites and going on the web and 
learning a great deal.

<p>

But at the same time, these children are able to 
access sites that provide hard-core pornography and are 
shocked by it that there are not any restrictions out there 
for that.

<p>

The telecommunications bill provided (for) the 
first time some kind of regulation going on.  Pornography 
has some form of regulation in every type of media, and this 
has allowed --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Even if it is just a driver's 
license at a video store, so that you are not giving it to 
kids.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Right, and this is going to provide 
a safeguard for these parents.  Our grass roots are very 
pleased with it, and almost it is like a security blanket.  
They are not scared for their kids to turn on their computer 
at home any longer.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I know we have been working for a 
long time to defund the Department of Education.  I have 
been in Washington 10 years, and I'm still hoping.  Any 
chance -- you know, there has been a lot of talk of the 
computer being great for home schools or charter schools -- 
any chance that Goals 2000 or educational choice could 
collide and there would be more parental option in our near 
future?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: It is probably going to be a 
long battle.  The entrenched bureaucracies and the unions 
are very strong in this area, and they have a lot of support 
in Congress on both sides of the aisle, and it is a tough 
battle.

<p>

But we are making headway.  There are many people 
who support parental choice, particularly many minority 
parents and lower and middle-income parents.  They see 
people at the national level, Presidents and Vice Presidents 
and other leaders of the civil rights community, and so on, 
sending their children to exclusive private schools, and 
they say, "Well, if they can afford to send their kids to 
those schools, why can't I send my kids to a school?  Why 
can't I have the wherewithal to send my kids to a private 
school?"

<p>

That is starting to put some cracks in the armor, 
so to speak, of the coalition that has been trying to limit 
parental choice.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There has been in Michigan some 
testing, some looking at ways to restructure an educational 
school system, and in New York City, the diocese which has 
consistently said to the New York City schools, "Give us 
your 1,000 poorest, worst-off children; we would be glad to 
educate them."

<p>

Do we see cracks in the armor, or when you all are 
lobbying on Capitol Hill, do the National Education 
Association and teachers' unions have the upper hand?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: They do. In a nutshell, they really 
do have the upper hand.  I don't know how to expound upon 
that, because they just have always -- they have more money 
than we do.  They control teachers, unfortunately, and they 
just have the upper hand as far as their policies are 
concerned.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to keep working 
on that.

<p>

More about your family's future when it comes to 
votes made by our congressional leaders when <i>Straight Talk</i>
returns.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. The 
Defense of Marriage Act, for which the Family Research 
Council held an exclusive briefing, was a victory in both 
the House and Senate.  Yet the homosexual activist agenda 
continues to have a profound impact in Washington.  Here 
again from the Family Research Council I am joined by Marty 
Dannenfelser, Jacqueline Halbig, and Loralei Gilliam.

<p>

Loralei, you're a southern girl.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: That I am.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It's hard to believe, isn't it, that 
we are actually discussing in a law that marriage is between 
a man and a woman and that we had to lobby on this.  What 
was the reaction on the House and Senate when we went up to 
talk about what is marriage?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: It was amazing that we actually had 
to produce a federal piece of legislation, a law, that 
states that marriage is defined by a man and a woman.  But, 
unfortunately, we have cases in Hawaii that are going to the 
Hawaiian Supreme Court for same-sex marriage.

<p>

I don't think it is a new idea that a man and a 
woman create a marriage.  Unfortunately, the homosexual 
agenda, the folks on that side thought that we were trying 
to oppress them by saying that same-sex marriage should not 
be legal.  It's a traditional defense of the traditional 
family.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But why would a case in a Hawaii court affect the 
rest of the country?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Well, Article IV of the Constitution 
states that each state would have to recognize a previous 
law in another state.  So if Hawaii passed the ability for 
same-sex marriage, then Texas would have to recognize that 
marriage, even though -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You from Texas know that would not go over.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: That would not go over, especially 
since we have sodomy laws on the books in Texas.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. Sodomy laws are interesting.
A lot of the homosexual activists were going to go for 
sodomy laws and attack them with this legislation.  But, 
Marty, when the votes got to the Hill, did the Congressmen 
and women see the value of voting for marriage?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They seemed to. They were able 
to split the difference in the Senate, though, because they 
had a vote the same day on what was called the Employment 
Nondiscrimination Act, which was a homosexual jobs civil 
rights type of bill that would put homosexual conduct on the 
same level as things like race, and we all know, as Colin 
Powell and others have stated, that they are very different 
things, that race is a benign characteristic that cannot 
change, whereas homosexual behavior is something that is 
changeable, and in fact thousands of people who have been in 
that lifestyle have left the lifestyle.

<p>

Yet Ted Kennedy and others in the Senate were 
determined to make that part of the law, and we have had 
examples when that has happened in other states where it has 
wreaked havoc in the work place where someone who was a 
homosexual, unbeknownst to the employer, did not get a 
promotion and then comes back and says, "Well, you didn't 
promote me because I'm a homosexual," and the employer says, 
"Well, I didn't know you were a homosexual."

<p>

Now, if that person was black, obviously, they 
would know that person was black, and they might have a case 
for saying there was discrimination.  But if the employer 
did not know they were a homosexual, they are really at 
great risk of lawsuits and all kinds of legal action that 
can cause a great deal of problem in the work place.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, it was really interesting.  You 
had the two bills, the Defense of Marriage Act, sort of 
establishing marriage in federal law and allowing the states 
to make their own decisions, going through at the same time 
as a gay civil rights bill.

<p>

I guess the question is, if how you have sex 
becomes a workplace issue, isn't this going to force 
everyone to fill out a form, "This is how I have sex"?  It 
is certainly not going to be apparent when you meet someone.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, that was one of the 
problems that we pointed out, and some of our friends in the 
Senate pointed out to their colleagues, that you are going 
to then have to start having records to demonstrate that you 
are hiring people, and then in order to have those records,
you have to start asking people, and that really starts 
invading people's privacy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. How do you prove it?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Correct. People don't want to 
be answering questions like that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It would seem very charged, and yet 
the vote was very close.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: It was only a one-vote margin, 
50 to 39, and one of the Senators who was absent would have 
supported that, and had he been there, Al Gore would have 
cast the deciding vote to pass that, because the Vice 
President votes to break ties.  So it was a very close vote, 
and Ted Kennedy vows that he'll be back next year and he'll 
be ready to pass that in the Senate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And what do you think will happen? 
Do you think they'll have a chance?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it will depend on the 
makeup of the Senate in the new Congress, and that is very 
much up in the air right now.  So I think as people realize 
more the facts about this issue that it will move in our 
direction.  As you know, we had the briefing up on the Hill, 
and we got feedback from people.  They didn't know that this 
was not a characteristic that you're born with.  They didn't 
know that there was another explanation for these sorts of 
issues, that there were thousands of people who leave that 
lifestyle and that there are ministries that help people in 
that situation.  And as they find facts like that out and 
they find out the problems that this can cause in the work 
place, they do tend to take another look at it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have about a minute left, and I 
know that one thing Family Research Council does 
consistently is fight for pro-family tax relief.
Jacqueline, what started in that front?  What did we see?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: We did see pro-family tax relief pass 
the House, and that was pretty exciting, a $500-per-child 
tax credit.  So that was a victory.  Unfortunately, it 
didn't fly in the Senate, but we did at least get that far 
in the House.  So that is encouraging.

<p>

Also along the lines of tax credits, there was an 
adoption tax credit which passed, something we have worked 
very hard for.  Because we are pro-life, we believe children 
should be adopted and give people a break who spend a lot of 
money trying to adopt children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think, what, the average cost of 
adoption is around $20,000, and this was $5,000 tax break?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is really significant for people.

<p>

MS. HALBIG: It is significant.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There was one other change in 
adoption law, wasn't there, Loralei?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Yes. This was the first time that
we were able to get transracial adoptions be approved.
There is not technically a law out there that says one race 
parent could not adopt a different race child, but, 
unfortunately, that was what was happening in the adoption 
agencies.  They were not letting cross-racial adoption 
happen.  And we have put on the books now that, yes, a white 
family can adopt a Hispanic child, or a black family can 
adopt an Oriental child.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And that was something that Hillary 
Clinton and Donna Shalala had fought, as I understand.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to come back 
and hear more about this when the 105th Congress comes.  
Thanks so much for being with us, and when <i>Straight Talk</i>
returns, we will bring you more information regarding issues 
affecting you and your family.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.

<p>

Have you ever wondered if women have had an impact 
on our political system; if the fact that women vote changes 
the way the world is, or at least the way the political 
system operates?  During the suffragette movement, when 
women were trying to get the vote, it was rumored that women 
were really going to change American politics, and today the 
gender gap is big news.

<p>

Just how do women view the political process, and 
what influence do they have?  We're going to hear from some 
experts who have a lot to say about how women are 
influencing the American political scene.

<p>

First, we are going to hear from Kay Coles James. 
She was former secretary of HHS in Virginia.  She is now 
head of government at Regent University, and in fact, she 
was once a vice president at Family Research Council.  She 
says that the way that women care about their families 
affects the way they care about politics.  Let's take a look 
at her insightful comments.

<p>

<i>[Note: Remarks of the participants for the 
balance of the telecast are segments from The Heritage 
Foundation Conference entitled "Women, Politics, and the 
1996 Elections," held September 27, 1996.]</i>

<p>

MS. JAMES: One media outlet says that there is 
something out there called Soccer Mom, and Soccer Mom is in 
fact the woman that both Bob and Bill are interested in 
dating right now.  She is one whose attentions they are all 
vying for.

<p>

Who is this person called Soccer Mom?  Now, those 
individuals who are doing the scientific polling will tell 
you precisely who she is.  I will only tell you what my 
impressions are of who she is.

<p>

And just for the sake of continuity, I have 
decided to name her, and I only picked this name because it 
is my daughter's, and when I've done this before, I've 
switched names four times within the speech because I forgot 
what I named her.  So let's call her Elizabeth.

<p>

Well, Elizabeth is, let's say, somewhere in her 
thirties.  She is a very active woman.  She is holding down 
a full-time job working outside the home.  She is sandwiched 
between her children and her aging parents.  Elizabeth has a 
lot on her mind.  While there are those in the nation who 
are figuring out how to balance the nation's budget, she is 
trying to figure out how to stretch the paycheck.

<p>

She is so very, very committed to being 
responsible with the family's finances.  She is not late on 
the bills, but boy, can she juggle that budget to make it 
all happen.  She is an incredible woman.  She cares deeply 
about her children, and she is very concerned about the 
future of this nation.

<p>

Now, when we ask Elizabeth how she feels about the 
upcoming election, there are three words that she picked out 
of a list for some research that was done for <i>Ladies' Home 
Journal</i>. She said, when asked to describe her feeling about 
politics, she says there are three adjectives:  frustrated, 
disgusted, and disillusioned.

<p>

I would like to add to that that right now 
Elizabeth is so engrossed in her own life that perhaps, just 
perhaps, even with the election as close as it is, she has 
not yet focused all of her time and attention on what is 
happening in national politics.  Right now Elizabeth is more 
concerned that if Bob could drive carpool for her this 
weekend and Bill could figure out how in the world she is 
going to get home from work, defrost dinner, get one child 
to piano lessons and the other one to a dance recital, then 
perhaps she would have time to concentrate on what they are 
saying.

<p>

My point to you is that I believe that Elizabeth 
and the other Soccer Moms out there are a very fluid group 
right now.  And if our national candidates could learn how 
to reach through the noise of their everyday lives, then 
perhaps they could get to her and persuade her that one of 
the two of them is the best choice to lead this nation.

<p>

Well, this particular Soccer Mom has, well, let's 
say for the sake of argument, a combined family income of
around $30,000, and she works as a loan officer in a bank.
Her husband works for the telephone company.

<p>

I just want to take you through Elizabeth the 
Soccer Mom's day and sort of set the stage for some of the 
things that you will be hearing.

<p>

Elizabeth turns over at 5:30 a.m., and as she 
smashes the clock down because its whining is driving her 
insane -- it came much, much too early, but, you see, she 
has to get up very, very early in order to prepare her 
children, herself, and, yes, her husband, in order to go out 
and face their work day.

<p>

Now, there are some things that are influencing 
Elizabeth's life at that moment that she doesn't even know 
about.  She isn't even aware of the fact that perhaps the 
reason that she is getting up and going out and facing a job 
and working that day is because the economy is as it is, and 
in order for her family to be able to survive, they need 
those two incomes.  And she isn't perhaps aware of the fact 
that while she is working 15 hours out of her week in order 
to pay her taxes and she only gets to spend 17 hours out of 
her week in one-on-one time with her children, that she is 
working almost as much time for the government as she is 
working for her children.  And someone needs to get that 
message through to her, so that when we begin to talk about 
a 15 percent tax cut, Elizabeth understands immediately what 
impact that's going to have on her and on her family.

<p>

Well, Elizabeth rouses those kids and gets them 
ready, and as she readies them for school, she begins to 
think about the kinds and the quality of education that her 
children are getting.  Now, she is very committed to public 
education.  Make no mistake about it.  She wants a good 
quality education in that community.  But her primary and 
her first responsibility is to her own children.  It is very 
important to her that they have the best education possible, 
and she somehow fears that her wealthier friends who can 
send their children to private school are getting a better 
edge, because when she looks at the standardized test 
results, for whatever reason, those children are scoring 
higher.

<p>

Now, she figures if we can get a little 
competition in there and somehow drive this issue, that 
perhaps we can improve the public schools, and Elizabeth 
believes, much like Polly Williams, that Bill Clinton should 
not be the only person who lives in public housing and sends 
his kids to private school.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And she would love to take her tax dollars that 
she is spending, she would love to take that money and use 
it to send her children to the school that she chooses, 
because she understands their unique gifts, abilities, and 
needs, and she wants to make the decision about what kinds 
of education her children receive.  Elizabeth is very 
concerned about what she sees happening in public schools in 
America today.

<p>

And so Elizabeth puts the children in the car, and 
she begins to drive off to drop them off for their day in 
public schools.  She is mortified as she drives through the 
neighborhood and goes through a shortcut to get there and 
cut off a few minutes so she won't be late for work, drives 
through a neighborhood that she doesn't always take to get 
there, and is horrified, mortified, petrified, as she sees 
what she believes to be a drug deal going on not more than a 
few blocks from her child's school.

<p>

Now, Elizabeth is very concerned about crime and 
drugs.  She somehow had gotten a sense of security when she 
saw the data that came out several years ago saying that 
casual use among teenagers was down, and she was glad to 
have Nancy Reagan stand up there and tell the children of 
America, "Just say no."  She wasn't smirking, she wasn't 
making light of drug use, and it was exactly the same 
message that she was giving at home.

<p>

And so she felt a certain amount of security, and 
if Elizabeth had time and was listening to the evening news, 
she knows that the gains that we made under President Bush 
have in fact evaporated and that drug use among teens is up, 
and that is frightening to her, because she cares about her 
children, and she doesn't want leadership in this country 
that says, "Yes," with a smile, "I used drugs, and if I had 
the opportunity, I would do it over again."

<p>

Well, she drops them off.  Finally now, Elizabeth 
is headed to work.  She works very hard all day, and when it 
gets to be lunch time, Elizabeth has several phone calls 
that she needs to make on her break.  You see, as a sandwich 
mom, meaning that she is sandwiched between her children and 
her elderly parents, usually at least two to three times a 
week she tries to call her mom and dad at lunchtime.  And 
when she calls them, her father is horrified, saying, "Have 
you heard what they're trying to do to Medicare?"  He is 
frightened.

<p>

She says, "Dad, think about it this way.  What if 
you had a limited amount of money and you looked ahead to 
the end of the month and you realized, Dad, that if you 
didn't spend your money wisely, you were going to run out of 
money before you got to the end of the month?  Now, you have 
two options, Dad.  You can either begin to cut back and 
scale back and maybe change your diet a little bit, or you 
could decide, 'I'm going to worry about it later; let's have 
steak and lobster for dinner tonight.'"

<p>

And Dad said, "Well, of course not.  I would 
figure out how to make it work, how to stretch the limited 
dollars that I have so that we can eat all month."  And she 
said, "Dad, that's what Republicans are trying to do.  And 
in fact, they are not talking about spending less money on 
the food budget; they are talking about spending more, but 
we are not going to increase it as much and as fast, because 
we simply don't have the resources to do that.

<p>

"Dad, they really do want to save Medicare and to 
make sure that in fact you will always have adequate medical 
coverage."  Elizabeth has a lot on her mind.

<p>

But, you know, her boss comes to her in mid-afternoon 
and says, "You know, we have a little bit of a 
problem in balancing out our books.  We're going to need you 
to stay and work a little late," so that, by the time she 
finally leaves work that night, it's dark outside, the 
streets are a little more quiet than they normally are, and 
she has to walk the two blocks that she has to go to get 
into her car.  She sees shadows as she walks to her car, and 
she is angry that Bill Clinton cut prison funding by $580 
million, because some of those people need to be locked up 
and behind bars.

<p>

And so I think that you are beginning to see that 
there is a lot that is happening at the national level that 
can be, should be, and is indeed important to Elizabeth.

<p>

As she makes it home that night, prepares the 
family's meal, and then sits down to watch the evening news, 
there are two more things that come to her attention.  
Elizabeth looks at what is happening internationally, and 
she recognizes that as she looks at her 17-year-old son and 
thinks about her brother who is a Marine, she is very 
concerned that in America's foreign policy that perhaps, 
just perhaps, we are committing American forces to places on 
our globe with missions that are ill-defined; we aren't sure 
what victory looks like; and we're not really clear why 
we're there.

<p>

And that is important because, see, Elizabeth is 
patriotic, and she has taught her son that he will fight for 
and defend freedom and that one day he may be called upon to 
do just that.  But she wants to be sure that when her son or 
her brother is put in harm's way, that it is for a reason 
that is of some vital interest to America.  And she also 
wants to know that he is the best equipped, that he is the 
best trained, and that he has all the tools and resources at 
his disposal to do the job.  She does not want to be one of 
those mothers of one of the rangers who went into Somalia 
and then later was told that some of the defense officials 
should have acted upon requests that came from some of the 
commanders that they needed more equipment and heavier 
armor.  You see, that would be cold comfort to her.

<p>

She wants to know that America's military is 
standing ready and well prepared.  And so that is important 
to her.  She is concerned about what she hears about 
military morale that has hit an all-time low.  She is very 
concerned as she listens to the evening news that perhaps 
America is not prepared to face the international 
challenges.

<p>

And so Elizabeth may not have focused entirely on 
the election yet, and Bob and Bill may still be courting.  
She will have the opportunity to focus on what that means to 
her in terms of education, in terms of crime, in terms of 
drugs, in terms of a strong national defense, in terms of a 
definable national foreign policy.  Because, you see, 
Elizabeth cares about all those things because, yes, she is 
a woman, but she is also an American.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. MAC LEOD: It is very important, as we talk 
about women and politics here in 1996, that we have some 
context to put that into.  We must understand the patterns 
of feminism, we must understand some of the past of feminism 
in order to be put there, and I am really glad to see a lot 
of people that are in my age group, because we are the ones 
who have received a very narrow view as we have been raised 
of the feminist movement.

<p>

I did my graduate thesis on the defeat of the 
Equal Rights Amendment in Iowa in 1992, and the reason I 
chose that topic was because as I talked to people in my age 
group, I discovered that we did not know what the Equal 
Rights Amendment was all about.  We knew there was this 
brouhaha over it when we were young, back in the 1970s, but 
we didn't know what the issues were that surrounded it.  The 
only things we had ever been taught were what we read in our 
textbooks, that the ERA was about equal pay for equal work. 
And, of course, that was not all that the Equal Rights 
Amendment was about.

<p>

So I am starting off today just bringing up a very 
poignant figure in American feminism, a woman named Betty 
Friedan, whom I am sure you have all heard of.  As I started 
working on my thesis, I thought, well, I really need to dive 
into the concepts and the ideologies of feminism to 
understand these women, where they were coming from.

<p>

So I picked up a copy of <i>The Feminine Mystique</i>,
and, of course, believing I would completely disagree with 
everything Betty Friedan said, I began to read. And to my 
horror, I was agreeing with her. And I read, and I read, 
and I remember sitting in the library, and before I knew it, 
I had read 125 pages straight of this book, and I thought, 
Something's wrong.  I'm agreeing with this woman.  I'm not 
supposed to agree with Betty Friedan.

<p>

And so I stepped back and thought, Okay, what is 
it that she accomplished?  I had recently ended a 
relationship, so I knew I was going to be coming out of grad 
school with no strings, no marriage prospects, would be 
heading off into the career world, would be getting a job, 
supporting myself, and I thought, I can identify with the 
things she is saying in this book.  She wrote that book to 
women who were either newly out of school and headed off to 
a career in the 1960s or women who were married, 
intelligent, a lot of them starting out, of course, Smith 
women, who were not fulfilled because they were at home 
doing laundry and changing diapers, and in many cases, that 
is about all they were doing.

<p>

And so she took some very real fears that I 
believe every women who has any education at all and any 
ambition at all faces, she took those fears, and she said, 
"Okay, if you have these concerns" -- and remember, these 
were concerns that all women have -- "then you're a 
feminist, and this is the road that you must travel."

<p>

An entire generation of young women began to read 
her work and began to agree.  "Oh, I agree with her.  I must 
be a feminist."  And that is how a lot of the masses of 
feminism as we know it, as modern feminism, really got 
moving.

<p>

But, of course, we know that the core of the 
feminist movement in the 1960s and 1970s was actually very 
radical.  So we saw this big battle in the 1970s over the 
Equal Rights Amendment, and of course, I don't know how many 
of you realize that the word "woman" does not appear in that 
amendment once.  It wasn't about women.  It was about 
something much deeper. It was about eradicating any gender 
differences and gender roles whatsoever.

<p>

Now, I just got married recently, and I am 
starting to say, anybody who is married knows that there are 
major differences between men and women, which doesn't mean 
we are not equal.  Of course, we believe that men and women 
are equal not only under the law but under God.  But there 
are definite differences.

<p>

Women were given equal rights in the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act and the 1972 Equal Employment Act.  These were 
situations where we didn't need an Equal Rights Amendment.

<p>

Well, the feminists lost in the 1970s.  Women, by 
and large, did not buy into the gender feminist perspective. 
So the feminists were unsuccessful in the 1970s.

<p>

They spent the 1980s taking the Equal Rights 
Amendment battle to the state level.  They fought it state 
by state by state.  Many states, like Illinois, had to fight 
it 12 times in a row.  Then in 1992 we had the last major 
battle on this issue, and that was in Iowa, and once again 
they lost, and once again they lost because American women 
still are not buying into this radical, hardened, gender 
feminist perspective.

<p>

So, today, who are American women?  Well, I will 
give you one example.  We at Concerned Women for America 
really do believe that we represent most American women.  Of 
course, the National Organization for Women wants to tell 
the world that we don't, that we're radical, that we're 
extreme.  I don't really think I look like an extremist, and 
I don't think I look very radical.  But that's what they 
tell the world.

<p>

But we decided to find a polling organization that 
has a good national reputation and say, What do American 
women believe?  Not CWA members.  We want to know what 
American women truly believe.

<p>

We found out that the social issues were the most 
important to American women today.  Fourteen percent said 
that crime was their top issue.  Eight percent said that 
declining moral values were important.

<p>

When we asked women if they considered themselves 
a feminist, 60 percent said no; 26 percent said yes; and 9 
percent said somewhat.  And that fits what is happening with 
the feminist lingo today.  It is getting into this nebulous 
field, and no one is sure what feminism really is anymore.

<p>

People were asked their total favorable view of 
National Organization for Women.  Only 36 percent had a 
favorable view of NOW.  That's very significant.  That's 
something we're not hearing in the media, but it's something 
that's important when you're considering women today and 
their voting patterns.

<p>

I think this was the most exciting statistic for 
us.  We discovered that eight out of ten women said that 
they would rather stay home with their children if they were 
financially able to do it.  It's not that we believe that 
women have to stay home or they should stay home, but we 
keep hearing over and over and over that women have careers 
and that that's more important, and, you know, children, 
just plug them into day care.  But eight out of ten women 
said, "If I could afford to, I would stay home."

<p>

But we have a very conservative group of women in 
this country, women that, when the media talks and says that 
women speak with one voice, they're wrong.  The liberal 
women out there and the conservative women out there exist, 
but they are in two very distinct camps, and as we look 
towards the elections, we need to realize that attaching the 
"women" label to one group no longer suffices.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. CORSO: Right now you can hear of a gender gap 
anywhere from 20 percent to 32 percent.  While men right now 
are statistically even in their vote for Dole or Clinton, 
women by far prefer Bill Clinton.  If you go back to 
Eisenhower, even for Kennedy, women voted more conservative 
then.  For Reagan's 1984 election, women eked out men just 
by two percentage points, 51-49 for Reagan.  However, now, 
as we see, it is anywhere -- 57 is the last I had heard, 57 
percent Clinton, 31 percent Dole, for women.

<p>

Why? Well, first of all, women support government 
programs more.  Government is not a bad thing for them.  
They would like to see it cut back a little bit, but the 
government is a protector.  That is why they look to the 
government.  Men want the government gone.  Big government 
is bad to them.  Big government is what is taking away the 
things that they want, things that they need.  They are more 
concerned with take-home pay and things like that, whereas 
the woman wants to know that the government is going to look 
out for, again, her children.

<p>

She is also very concerned about social spending. 
She wants to know that the government will be able to take 
care of her parents, whereas the husband is concerned about 
his parents -- he is not going to just ship them off, but 
the burden again comes on the wife to make sure not only her 
parents are taken care of but his parents are taken care of, 
also.  That is why she is concerned that the government is 
not going to cut out Medicare.

<p>

Welfare is also important to women.  They agree 
that right now the welfare state is not the way it should 
be, but don't get rid of it.  Trim it.  Cut it back.  Make 
it streamlined.

<p>

Women, though, are much more conservative when it 
comes to cultural value issues, drugs and crime.  Children 
who take drugs are a mother's worst nightmare.  They also 
worry, I am allowing my child to walk to school.  What's 
going to happen on his or her way home?  This is a big, big 
concern.

<p>

Crime is also a concern when it comes to 
punishment.  Women want to see these criminals punished, but 
they also want to see them rehabilitated.  People are not 
generally bad.  A man wants to see the guy put away for as 
long as possible.  That's another huge difference.

<p>

Women want to see the jails restructured, not just 
build more but restructure them, do more in the ways of a 
halfway house, allow a criminal who is not a violent 
offender to come out and try to get him or her back into 
society.  If, however, it is a rapist or it is someone who 
has done any crime towards children, you can throw that out 
the window.  They want that person put away for as long as 
possible.

<p>

Right now the gap, the infamous gender gap, comes 
from not just the big difference between men and females but 
also from the difference between women.  There is a group 
being courted very, very strongly by the Dole and Clinton 
camps.  Anxious white females, instead of angry white males, 
is what they are being called. Or the Soccer Moms.  These 
are suburban, they are married, they work and they stay at 
home, depending.  They have to work because they need the 
second income.  They really do not want to.  They want to 
take their kids to soccer practice.  They want to work for 
the PTA.  They want to volunteer in the library.  However, 
they just can't.  They need the second income.  It makes 
them a little bit bitter.

<p>

Their age ranges from 35 to 54, and their 
household income is about $40,000 and up.  This is perfectly 
the middle class.

<p>

Right now, they are leaning very strongly towards 
Bill Clinton.  They feel that Bill Clinton is not the 
greatest President we've ever had -- they'll never admit to 
that -- but he is the better of the two choices.

<p>

Why are they against Bob Dole?  A lot of it is his 
age.  They all have parents who are hitting the same age 
right now.  They see what their parents go through.  Bill 
Clinton is young.  Bill Clinton is their age.  He has a 
daughter.  He knows what it's like trying to get that 
daughter into ballet school and making sure she gets into 
the right college.  These are the worries and concerns these 
people have.

<p>

Bill Clinton's character is also not that much of 
an issue to these people.  Character is not going to be the 
deciding factor.  They actually may see him a little bit 
better for all the problems that have happened.  He is able 
to stand up to these attacks.  Nothing has stuck to him.  
Therefore, he is just standing tough and bouncing back.

<p>

They also like Hillary. She is someone who is 
standing by her husband.  She is someone who is trying to 
raise Chelsea and having attacks thrown at her left and 
right.  Yet she is still standing there; she is still 
smiling.

<p>

These women also love Elizabeth Dole, so there is 
going to be no head-to-head here between the First Ladies.  
She is someone who, again, is standing by her husband and 
someone who knows the burden of working and trying to take 
care of her family, Bob Dole.

<p>

Women -- you can change.  Republicans can focus 
more towards women, and there are three ways to do this.  
The first way is focus on the children.  Democrats and 
Republicans have always talked about today and all that.  
You will notice now they are talking about the future, our 
children.  Everyone, all women are going to empathize with 
that.

<p>

You also see today that the drug issue has become 
forefront.  Every ad we see is about drugs.  The two camps 
know this is a way to appeal to the women, to allow the 
women to come front and center.

<p>

Women also make up their minds late.  This swing 
voter, this Soccer Mom group, they are leaning towards 
Clinton, but they are not definite.  They could change their 
minds.  And what is going to happen is the way that they 
talk about children, the way they talk about drugs is what 
is going to lean them one way or the other.

<p>

It is also the family.  The family is very 
important.  Family values got played up in 1992.  "Family 
values" as a catch phrase is not going to work.  True 
feeling towards the families, seeing how people, how the 
members of Congress, how Clinton, how Dole react to their 
own families and family problems -- women are not fooled by 
the words; they need to see.  They need to see what these 
people are going to do.

<p>

You can't just talk to women; you have to listen 
to women, also.  Big difference.  Men, you can talk to them. 
Men will listen, they'll sit, they'll think about it, 
they'll go off.  Women have to have a dialogue.  That is 
another big difference.  You can talk to a woman, but if you 
don't give her a chance to talk back to you, then you're 
going to lose that woman right there.

<p>

<p>

MS. BOWMAN: I have been looking at gender issues 
for quite a long time and, as a matter of fact, did my first 
study of gender issues going back to the early survey data 
from the 1930s, and I thought I would talk a little bit 
about the differences that we have seen over time and about 
where we are today.  Of course, there weren't as many 
pollsters in the 1930s as there are today, but they asked, 
actually, I think, perhaps more interesting questions than 
the pollsters are asking today over a broad range of issues 
overall.

<p>

If you look at the data from the 1930s to the 
early 1970s, the pattern appeared to be pretty similar.  
There were some areas where men and women differed 
significantly and many areas where they didn't differ at 
all.  The so-called women's issues, defined very differently 
in that period than they are today, produced hardly any 
differences between men and women.  There are not 
significant differences between men and women today on 
something like abortion.  There are more significant 
differences by age.  But there were also no differences in 
this earlier period.

<p>

From the earliest of survey history, men and women 
have differed very significantly on when it is proper for a 
society to use force, very broadly defined:  sending troops 
abroad, gun control, the death penalty.  If you look back to 
the Persian Gulf War, you can see gender chasms on some 
questions involving, for example, the acceptability of 
civilian casualties, men saying completely acceptable, women 
saying not acceptable.  So this is an area that has always 
differentiated the sexes.

<p>

Another area, in the early period, women were less 
likely to be informed, less likely to have opinions, and I 
think, as Regina said, there is still evidence of that in 
the polls today.  Women are not necessarily less likely to 
be informed; they are clearly lagging indicators in terms of 
making their views known, making up their minds.  If you 
look, for example, at attitudes about Jack Kemp in some of 
the polls, they are more positive than negative among women, 
extraordinarily positive among men.  But over a third to 40 
percent of women don't have an opinion yet about Jack Kemp. 
They are lagging indicators.

<p>

You see this in a number of different areas.
Women took a long time to be convinced that the fundamental 
nature of the Soviet Union had changed.  Men were pretty 
convinced early on.  After Gorbachev, it became clear to 
them that the situation had changed dramatically.

<p>

The economy is a very important issue where women 
tend to be a lagging indicator, perhaps because they are 
more concerned, as Regina said, with families, and those are 
the first things that come to their minds in thinking about 
supporting their families.  But women are much less likely 
to believe, or much slower to believe, that the recession 
has ended, that the economy is getting better, again 
suggesting another fundamental difference.

<p>

But in that early period from 1930 to 1970, that 
was about all that we learned:  differences on the use of 
force, women less likely to have opinions, similarities on 
many issues overall, and no differences on the so-called 
women's issues.

<p>

If you look from 1975 on, new things began to 
appear in the data, and while I think it is dangerous to tie 
attitudinal data to demographic data, clearly, there are 
some links.  Women were coming back into the work force in 
significant numbers after the war experience, when, of 
course, they had been active in the work force and then out 
of the work force for a while.  Coming back in, they were at 
the lowest rung of the economic ladder, first hired, first 
fired, and many of them were heading single families.  So 
the interaction of those demographic trends, I think, 
produced some of the changes that we saw in the attitudinal 
data.

<p>

Some things stayed the same.  Women continued to 
be slower to form firm opinions than did men.  So-called 
women's issues, once again, no differences between men and 
women.

<p>

We saw some new areas that we had not seen before, 
and those are the most important because they are what 
Regina addressed most dramatically.  One, the minor issue:  
women appear to be more risk-averse than men, Shannon Lucid 
notwithstanding.  When Gallup asked the question about 
whether you'd like to ride on the space shuttle, there's a 
35 percentage point difference between men and women on that 
question.  Most women do not want to ride on the space 
shuttle; most men think it would be a great idea to go up 
and give that a try.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But again, you don't see a gap of 35 percentage 
points on many questions in survey research.  This is a 
gender chasm.  So the risk issues -- the location of nuclear 
power plants, chemical additives in food, safety and health 
issues overall -- women appear to be more risk-averse.

<p>

And then the final area that I thought Regina 
covered so well involves attitudes about the proper role of 
government in the society.  Women, by just about every poll 
that I see, favor a stronger role for government.  That 
isn't to say that they want government involved in their 
lives in an overwhelming way, but they do favor a stronger 
role for government.

<p>

I am just going to touch on three questions that 
were asked recently on issues involving government and see 
how you would respond to the questions, and then I will tell 
you how most men and women responded to those questions.

<p>

In early September, CBS and the <i>New York Times</i>
included two questions in their national survey that
underscored the deep skepticism that both sexes have about 
government.  But when asked to assess what kind of an impact 
government has on most people's lives -- is it negative, is 
it positive, or doesn't government have much impact at all? 
-- the national results, 42 percent said the impact of 
government was negative, 32 percent said positive, and 16 
percent said that government didn't have any impact on their 
lives at all.  But women were much more likely to say that 
government had a positive impact than were men.

<p>

Another question in the same poll:  Is government 
doing too many things better left to business and 
individuals, or should government be doing more to solve our 
country's problems?  Think about how you would answer that. 
Well, 62 percent of all Americans said that government was 
doing too much, and 28 percent said that government should 
be doing more, again a pretty clear opinion overall.  But 
once again, women were stronger on the pro-government side. 
Both men and women were negative about government, but 
women favored the government role more strongly than men.

<p>

But when the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> posed a question on 
their September 7-10 poll, they asked people which idea came 
closer to their own idea about government. The first 
statement was, "Government should provide tools to help 
families better their lives, such as education and job 
training."  The other formulation was, "The best thing that 
government can do for families is to cut taxes and allow 
individual families to decide for themselves how to allocate 
their money" -- very much what Bob Dole is talking about in 
trusting the people.

<p>

The overall percentages:  47 percent that 
government should provide tools to help families, 43 percent 
that the best thing government could do was get out -- a 
public pretty evenly split overall, but once again, women 
came down more strongly on the pro-government side.  Again, 
men and women were not overwhelmingly different on these 
questions, but it persists.  It is what we call in survey 
research patterned.  It is always there.  Women take the 
slightly stronger role for government overall.

<p>

So those areas have stood out in the research, and 
I think that is what is driving the gender gap that we are 
seeing in the Presidential-level polling overall.  We don't 
see it as much when you are asked about individual 
congressional races, and I think that that is because 
individual Republican Congressmen have dealt better with a 
lot of these issues in their districts in terms of talking 
about what is on their agenda than perhaps Bob Dole has 
overall.

<p>

But Republicans and conservatives have an enormous 
amount of work to do.  We cannot deny these very significant 
numbers that we are now seeing in this election overall.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. JAMES: Well, you see, politics is a very 
complex game here, and it is also very important for us as 
women to be as sophisticated about how that works, and so 
what that means for me is that not only is it important for 
the issues that I care about, but it is also very important 
for me that I look, as chairs of the various subcommittees, 
that I look for the leadership in the House, so it is 
important for me that Trent Lott stays there.  And if I 
lived in an area where I had two choices -- thankfully, I 
don't -- two bad choices, I would always go for the person 
that is going to keep Trent Lott and Newt there.  I mean, I 
would, because that is important for the overall, global, 
larger picture.  And so we are sophisticated enough to 
understand that and to be able to work with that.

<p>

MS. MILLER: We have talked about depending upon 
the age of the women makes a difference.  We have talked 
about employment status.  What about family status, whether 
they are married or not married, and how does that make a 
difference in voting patterns?  I don't know who wants to 
take a stab at that.

<p>

MS. BOWMAN: There is also a marriage gap, and in 
some surveys it is larger than the gender gap.  It is a 
very, very significant gap, with married voters being more 
Republican and single voters being more Democratic.

<p>

Married voters tend to turn out to vote.  They 
have more of a stake in the society.  We like to say that 
once you get a mortgage, a marriage, and children, that you 
are drawn back into the political process, and that is, I 
think, what the political science literature suggests, and 
clearly, there are significant marriage gaps.

<p>

MS. MAC LEOD:  . . . is when you look at this 
economy, fundamentally, we started in this nation on a 
premise that the family was the thing that would drive the 
economy; and as you have successful families and family 
businesses, you are going to filter that up, and you are 
going to end up having a successful economy.

<p>

So I think there is definitely merit to that as 
far as the families are getting smaller, people aren't 
focusing on family businesses, people aren't thinking about 
the family in terms of the economy in many instances these 
days, just at the grass-roots level, and I think that could 
have an effect.

<p>

As far as for Betty Friedan, I would just say you 
have just exemplified and pointed out the shift that the 
feminist movement has taken.  They hit on the social issues, 
and some of the more radical social issues, for so long, and 
they have suddenly discovered that women, younger women 
today, don't care, because they have never been told they 
can't get a certain kind of job.  They have never been 
discriminated against in any way, shape, or form.  And so 
when they are presented with this radical social agenda, 
they say, "Take a hike.  This doesn't affect me."

<p>

But the economy and their pocketbook is the one 
area that they are still able to have some sway.  So that is 
the direction that feminism, from a policy perspective, has 
been moving in the last few years.

<p>

MS. MILLER: Laurel, I remember the U.N. Fourth 
World Conference.  There are a lot of interesting things 
that they did in terms of the platform, and I do want you to 
mention a couple in terms of how the word "family" and how 
the word "mother" were recrafted, and it did not appear in a 
mainstream press in this country at all.  They just said, 
"We're doing wonderful things for women.  The Hillary 
Clinton speech is really going to uplift women around the 
globe."

<p>

Yet, at the same time -- you made an interesting 
comment about how they've taken this agenda that didn't work 
on the federal level, hasn't worked on the state level; it 
has gone to the international level.  Would you just mention 
a couple of those?

<p>

MS. MAC LEOD: I will give you some wonderful 
examples. Households, family -- they defined family and 
violence against women -- we are seeing a lot lately about 
violence against women, and of course, we are all women, and 
we would say no, we are not in favor of violence against 
women. But this U.N. document defined violence against 
women as always being home-based, and men are the abusers of 
women and children, and that is how this document put it.  
It was an occasion to go man-bashing rather than to address 
real concerns and issues of crime.

<p>

As far as motherhood, they sought to take out the 
word "mother," to remove the word "mother" from the document 
and replace it with "caretaker," or "household."  When they 
are taking about family, they want to talk about household, 
not family, because it is a system now -- and, of course, 
the gender feminism here in the West, especially in the 
United States, is really driving that -- gender, again, 
socially constructed.  They refused to define the word 
"gender" in the document.

<p>

So you have, for all intents and purposes, a 200-
page document that talks about gender all the way through, 
and yet it is never defined, because when push came to shove 
-- and I know Victor Morero(?) was pushed to the wall by 
Congressman Chris Smith in a hearing summer before last -- 
he said, "I'm sorry, we can't define gender as male and 
female, because there are large segments of society that 
believe it is socially constructed."

<p>

That was the position of our United States 
delegation.  That is the position that was maintained in 
Beijing.  There is no definition of gender, which is 
ludicrous.  When you look at any bill here in the United 
States, we have findings for bills in Congress.  We also 
have definitions for terms, because we know that, legally, 
if you don't define your terms, the sky is the limit in how 
they can be implemented.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we stand with the American Family
Association and recognize Pornography Awareness Week.

<p>

Pornography permeates our society in a variety of 
forms, most of which we try to keep from children.  Yet 
pornography has entered a new, more accessible frontier, 
cyberspace.  Child pornography and other hard-core obscenity 
travels through cyberspace at an alarming pace and not only 
reaches children, who are often more adept on the computer 
than their parents, but also abuses children by portraying 
them in a sexual manner.

<p>

In fact, it is not illegal to send a child hard-core filth 
through e-mail or to make it easy for kids to 
find obscene pictures of sex and sexual-mutilation deaths.
Children, women, and men, though pornography addiction, are 
all victims of a multi-million-dollar pornography industry. 
And it is of particular concern now, because President 
Clinton has pledged to get every school hooked up on the 
Internet, a sometimes dangerous computer playground.
Tonight we talk to two key players in this crucial battle 
against pornography.

<p>

But first, let's talk about the election less than 
one week away.  The majority of U.S. voters are women, whose 
voices both inside and outside the beltway can no longer be 
ignored.  It is important for conservatives and liberals 
alike to learn how to talk to this constituency of women, to 
win their hearts and their votes.

<p>

Let's hear how women at a special Heritage 
Foundation event addressed this gender issue, as we take you 
Behind the Headlines.

<p>

<p>

[Segments from The Heritage Foundation Conference 
entitled "Women, Politics, and the 1996 Elections," held 
September 27, 1996, follow:]

<p>

MS. BLAIR: In America today, the term "working 
family" is practically an oxymoron.  You can work or you can 
have a family, but it is awfully, awfully hard to have both. 
The reason why that happens is, quite simply, the tax 
burden. The tax burden is what drives the second person in 
the family into the work force, as we have seen from the CWA 
poll, which showed that 80 percent of women, if they could, 
would stay home with their children.

<p>

What drives the tax burden?  It is often called 
women's interests, but what it really is is interest groups' 
interests.  Those are the folks who want to get every 
taxpayer in America to contribute one penny so that they can 
do this good thing, and those pennies add up, and you find 
that you've got folks working very, very hard to pay the 
government and try to manage to have a decent life for 
themselves.

<p>

If you look at the social issues, it seems to me 
that one thing we really cannot deny is that money has not 
solved those problems, and we would all have to acknowledge 
that it is going to be time and attention that solves those 
problems. Unfortunately, the more government we have, the 
more we are simply throwing money at those problems and not 
time and attention; and the more we drive women unwillingly 
into the work force and drive taxes up to take money away 
from families, the more we are simply doing the wrong thing 
for those problems.

<p>

The women who would like to be at home, the women 
who would like to be able to do volunteer work in their 
communities, so they say, would be exactly the people who 
would be doing volunteer work in their communities to help 
these social problems, who would be raising their children 
in a way that they felt confident that the children would 
turn out to be okay and solve some of those social problems.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. ARNETT: Let's listen to what women are 
saying.  And I think that something I am hearing today is, 
as a conservative women, I don't understand why the polls 
show that women are so overwhelmingly supporting Bill 
Clinton, because he stands for everything that I as a 
conservative woman think is contrary to our interests.

<p>

I believe that conservative women are really at 
the critical threshold of being the most important voice and 
the one that is the least heard in this debate, because 
conservative women have a sense of a society in which values 
matter and the individual and the family are the center of 
decisionmaking, not the government; in which there is a 
balance between different levels of government, where 
community service is something that we consider to be 
something that we want to do, where children and the future 
generations are something that we think about every day.

<p>

When you have a government that -- the classic 
quote -- "a government who can give you everything you want 
is a government who can take away everything you have," and 
there is just this disconnect with women being concerned 
about the future, being compassionate, wanting security, and 
yet all of the programs that have been shown by liberal 
agendas in which government controls the center of power are 
against the things that women most, in my sense, value.

<p>

So I think, as conservative women, we have an 
obligation to help others understand the consequences of 
these government policies.  And I also think women, in a lot 
of ways, are the ones who suffer most right now from the 
policy fixes that we most need.

<p>

The taxation and the tax treatment of health 
insurance is a tremendous problem that drives many of the 
distortions that we see in the current system.  For example, 
let's take two people, one woman who is working two jobs -- 
she may be divorced, she may be a single mom -- with two 
kids, and she doesn't have health insurance.  She is 
working. She is trying to provide for herself, for her 
family. She has stretched time and resources absolutely to 
the limit. She doesn't have health insurance, but she still 
has to pay her taxes.

<p>

She works at a company as maybe a temp, and the 
chief executive officer has this incredibly generous health 
insurance policy.  The reason for that is that the only way 
you can get a generous tax break for health insurance is if 
your employer buys the policy for you.  And so you wind up 
with this incredible, incredible distortion at the center of 
our health care system that costs $100 billion a year in tax 
benefits, in which the chief executive of a company can get 
all of his medical bills paid, absolutely everything, 
probably time at a spa, mountain climbing, all part of a 
health plan.

<p>

And here is this woman who is paying her taxes and 
working as hard as she possibly can.  She doesn't have 
health insurance.  The only way that she can get health 
insurance is to either go on welfare so she can get Medicaid 
or to try to get a job that pays generous enough benefits so 
she can get health insurance.

<p>

That is a terrible problem, where you have this 
woman paying taxes to subsidize health insurance for the 
chief executive officer so he can have this generous health 
benefit plan.  That is the kind of invisible problem in the 
current system that, if women knew about that, they would be 
outraged.

<p>

On taxes, we did a little chart here -- I should 
have brought it as an overhead to show you -- that shows 
that the average family pays more in taxes than it spends 
for food, shelter, transportation, and clothing combined.  
If you visualize a bar chart in which state and local taxes 
are a higher line than those four other things -- food, 
clothing, shelter/housing, and transportation combined -- 
people don't understand that, because they see the paycheck 
that they get, and they don't understand the reason you're 
having to work a second job, the reason you're having to be 
in the work place instead of being home where you want to 
be, raising your children, as eight of ten women say they 
want to do, is because you have to pay all these taxes.

<p>

Government security, the security that you say you 
want from government, is the very reason that your life is 
being so disrupted by a government that is seeping in in its 
power and authority to either take away the resources and 
the authority that you have or to pretend to give you 
something on one hand but to take two handfuls out on the 
other side.

<p>

That kind of education, I believe, as conservative 
women, we have a responsibility to help other people 
understand that government security and compassion and the 
sense of being in control of your own life is not something 
that can come from Washington.

<p>

<p>

MS. SILBERMAN: I believe that conservatives are 
somewhat tone-deaf in the way that they relate to American 
women and the American people.

<p>

I don't know whether you all have noticed, as I 
have, in the last few weeks, there have been pundits on all 
sides of the ideological spectrum (who) having been talking 
about the "feminization of American politics" in relation to 
the gender gap.

<p>

I am absolutely fascinated by this, and I think it 
behooves conservatives to spend some time figuring out the 
whys and wherefores of this phenomenon, because it 
absolutely is a phenomenon.

<p>

At first blush, I think, to speak of the 
feminization of American politics is counterintuitive to the 
principles which many of my friends take as an article of 
faith, and that is that one's gender should not dictate 
one's ideology and that having a uterus does not 
automatically mean that you are a liberal.

<p>

It seems to me that the gender gap's inescapable 
concomitant is the feminization of American political 
discourse, and I have come to believe that both the gender 
gap and the feminization of our politics have resulted from 
the fact that conservatives are tone-deaf, and that 
everything that people hear in the media and from our 
culture really reflects the resonance of the liberal point 
of view, because conservatives just don't know how to talk 
to people.

<p>

[Segments concluded.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, we'll talk to those 
in the fight against pornography, as <i>Straight Talk</i> observes 
Pornography Awareness Week.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. For more than a decade, the 
American Family Association has declared Pornography 
Awareness Week.  To help us understand why this week is so 
crucial, I am joined by two of those who have worked 
together in the battle against the multi-million-dollar 
pornography industry.  I would like to welcome Dee Jepsen, 
president of Enough is Enough, and Cathy Cleaver, the Family 
Research Council's director of legal policy.  Welcome to the 
show.

<p>

You all have been working on this issue for a long 
time, and why is that?  I think a lot of people think, well, 
I've seen some naked pictures and it hasn't really had an 
effect on me.  Why do we even need to be concerned about 
pornography?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, first of all, the material that 
we are talking about is illegal material, and it has a very 
harmful effect upon society in general, and specifically, we 
have a great concern for children.

<p>

Today, with the availability of this material via 
the Internet, through the computers that kids are more 
literate at than most adults, it is a very big problem and 
getting bigger.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: We have so many ways in which we 
have seen pornography devastate communities and 
relationships. Sometimes we talk about the victims of 
pornography, and they, of course, include women and 
children, but not just women and children.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Men also are very manipulated by 
pornography, and some don't realize it until they find that 
they have a compulsion to consume it.  So it really has no 
beneficial effect in our society, and we ought to keep 
working to try to push it away from the mainstream and into 
the fringes.

<p>

We have to tolerate some of it, some marginal 
amount, because of our free speech jurisprudence, but we 
don't have to tolerate it in front of our kids and we don't 
have to tolerate it in front of non-consenting adults.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Go ahead, Dee.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: It is ironic, too, Kristi, that some 
people in our society feel, men feel they should have the 
freedom to have this material.  The irony is that once they 
get addicted to it, which happens quite easily, they are no 
longer in control of that desire to see that material; it is 
in control of them. And we see all kinds of devastation, as 
Cathy mentioned, within family structures, and it becomes 
the hard copy, if you will, of what is playing in the 
theater of their minds, and what you see and what you hear 
does affect how you act.  I mean, that is what education is 
all about.  That is why we have multi-millions and, I am 
sure, billions of dollars spent on advertising in this 
country, to affect action.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The scope of pornography -- and 
let's just define it for a second about some of the kinds of 
pornography you are most concerned about -- I mean, a lot of 
people, they think pornography, they think <i>Playboy</i> magazine,
and I am not sure that they are really aware of the kinds of 
material that is available and that there is pornography 
that is actually illegal, because free speech seems to be a 
get-out-of-jail-free card, you know, in our society. It's a 
speech issue, so we can't stop anything.

<p>

But, Cathy, you are a lawyer.  How do the courts 
define what is illegal pornography?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Well, the word "pornography" is not 
a legal term.  Pornography refers to any representation that 
is designed to arouse the viewer.  But then we move beyond 
the general definition into the legal terms.  There is a 
term called "obscenity," and what that doesn't mean -- 
people think that means foul speech.  It can include foul 
speech, but what obscenity is is the hard-core pornography 
that the Supreme Court says deserves no legal protection.  
The First Amendment does not protect obscenity or hard-core 
pornography.  Adults can't trade in it; they certainly can't 
give it to kids; they can't export it or import it; you 
can't sell it or buy it.

<p>

So obscenity, hard-core pornography, and that 
would be the XXX type of material or worse, simply is not a 
legal commodity.  It's like drugs:  it's illegal.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It's like bestiality, torture -- 

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Mutilation. Child pornography, of 
course, is a form of it, but all kinds of really bizarre 
behavior involving numerous men, women, animals.  It is 
beyond description.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It is the deviant -- things people 
that aren't into this wouldn't even imagine.  It is beyond 
the imagination.  But then you look at the category of 
things, examples of which might be <i>Playboy</i> and <i>Penthouse</i>.
Those types of things have been deemed by the courts -- we 
don't always agree with this -- as being legal for adults 
but illegal for kids, and that would be legal pornography.
It is not obscene, but it can be characterized certainly as 
pornography.  And those things, we are allowed as citizens 
to enact laws or to encourage our legislators to enact laws 
to restrict the sale of these things, but we cannot prevent 
adults completely from getting them.  So that would be the 
second category of pornography.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Dee, you had a long and prestigious 
career before you came to Enough is Enough, which truly 
focuses on the hardest kind of pornography.  But what is the 
scope of pornography?  This is Pornography Awareness Week.
How many lives are touched by it?  How much money is 
involved?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, we have always said, in recent 
years it is an $8 billion to $10 billion a year industry.
With the advent of the computer and the Internet as the new 
delivery system, I imagine those figures now have changed 
quite a bit. It is hard to measure. But the effect that it 
has had in human life is beyond measurement.  You know, we 
get letters, and we look into the faces and the hearts of 
people every day in one way or another that have been harmed 
by it.

<p>

Children who were molested, and one of the major 
tools in that molestation was pornography, will have a pain, 
a hurt in their heart that, even if they go through 
counseling and healing, there will always be a scar from it 
all their life. Ofttimes people that molest children were 
molested as children, not always certainly, but that is a 
factor.  Sometimes people turn to self-abuse because of 
misplaced guilt or low self-esteem.

<p>

It has a huge effect upon society, and I think it 
is even bigger than that, because it is a devaluation of 
human life, and there is no respect because there is no love 
involved.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I have certainly read in some of the 
literature on pornography that it encourages -- you know, if 
men see women as objects and they need these kinds of 
devices to become aroused, I mean, eventually, you can't 
have a healthy relationship if you can't see women as 
anything other than something that is a tool.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That is right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: That is interesting.  Just this 
year, a psychiatrist named Dr. Gary Brooks has come out with 
a book that I would recommend called <i>The Centerfold
Syndrome</i>. It talks about how society is perpetuating and 
helping perpetuate the myth of the centerfold as the ideal 
woman, and all other women as being inadequate.  And men are 
manipulated by this, the result of which is inability to 
have intimacy with real women.

<p>

It is a fascinating book.  He is by no means any 
sort of conservative or religious leader.  He is a 
psychiatrist who has counseled men for many years about 
their issues of masculinity, and he has come out with this, 
and many people are angry with him.  The ACLU and others 
think he is a fraud.  But some feminist groups are taking 
note and saying, yes, that is what we have been trying to 
say all along.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, you know, every feminist, every 
religious, every non-religious, every moderate, every 
conservative, every liberal woman in this country ought to 
agree on this issue, and caring men should, also.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And I think they do.

<p>

We are going to want to hear more about this and 
what happens with children when we come back. When <i>Straight 
Talk</i> returns, we are going to bring you more about the fight 
to protect our children from hard-core pornography.  Stay 
tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are joining with the 
American Family Association in recognizing Pornography 
Awareness Week.  With me to discuss the need for such a week 
is Dee Jepsen, president of Enough is Enough, and Cathy 
Cleaver, the Family Research Council's director of legal 
policy.  Welcome back.

<p>

We were talking a little bit earlier about the 
effect that pornography has had on men, but pornography, 
Dee, has it not had an effect on crime?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Yes, it really has, and Cathy can 
probably cite some studies about how it has affected areas 
where there is pornography available, sexually oriented 
businesses exist.  But it encourages rape, because a lot of 
this material is showing women being portrayed as being 
overpowered by men and used sexually, and demeaned and 
degraded.

<p>

It also plays a very large role in the molestation 
of children.  It very often, in fact most often, is involved 
in child molestation.  They use it not only for their own 
incitement, but they use it to break down the inhibitions of 
the child, and they use it as an instruction manual to show 
the child what to do.  And then if they photograph or film 
that molestation, producing child pornography therefore, 
they will often use it to blackmail the child into silence.

<p>

So it plays a huge role in that, and it has an 
economic effect upon communities, as well, where this is 
available.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: There are many ways in which the 
impact of pornography has been studied, and you don't 
usually hear a lot about this because there are forces out 
there -- free speech rights, absolutists -- that don't want 
people to really know this, and that is, where there is a 
high consumption of pornography, there is a correlative high 
incidence of rape and sexual attack.  There just simply is.

<p>

Oklahoma City was studied over a four-year period 
in the mid-eighties, and over 130 porn and sex businesses 
were run out of the city, and the rape rate dropped 50 
percent as it was rising in surrounding cities.  There was a 
direct correlation to the amount of pornography that was 
available and that was being consumed by the people of that 
area.

<p>

There are studies upon studies of community values 
and community worth and how housing and businesses and the 
value of that property diminishes immediately as soon as 
porn businesses move in en masse to an area.  You might 
think this is common sense, but it is also good business 
sense.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: There are many ways to approach 
fighting pornography.  There are spiritual, moral, but also 
business and just simple common-sense ways.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, the use of pornography in 
sex crimes, I think, has been really illustrated by the 
National Center on Missing and Exploited Children, which we 
have had on the show before, but just talking about how they 
use that pornography in the same way that men become 
addicted.  You become stimulated, and then you need to 
escalate the kinds of materials -- 

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right. It's an addictive process.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is, and a desensitization to the violence of it, and 
then in acting out.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There was some legislation recently, 
Cathy.  It didn't work, but it was interesting, to attempt 
to deal with the fact that pornography is used to act out 
sex crimes in a pattern of use.  Could you tell us about 
that?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Sure. A few years ago, we were all 
fighting for the Pornography Victims Compensation Act.  What 
that would have provided would be a tool for people, 
individuals who are harmed by pornography because of either 
an attack or some other personal violence, allowing that 
individual to attempt to prove that this pornography played 
a significant factor in their harm.  That law failed, but I 
wouldn't be surprised if we see that coming up again, 
because it makes a lot of sense.

<p>

When there is a direct business injury because of 
an unreasonable and careless business operation, you can 
recover business damages.  But there is no personal damage 
recovery right now from the ill effects of pornography.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.  What I found so interesting 
about that case was it was a case where a gentleman had a 
video, that he would kidnap a woman -- 

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: And imitate the video.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: -- and imitate the video, actually 
play and stop the video and do that thing to the woman, and 
did this repeatedly.  It was very clear that he was acting 
out that specific video.  And they were not able to do 
anything to the company that had sold him a blueprint for 
murder.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's really what it is, and people 
may not have accepted this idea at the time, but I do think, 
over a period of time -- it takes a while for the public to 
become educated to something.  You think about what has 
happened in a generation as far as smoking is concerned, 
about drinking and driving.  It took 10 or 11 years for 
MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, to bring about a public 
change of heart, a mind-set.

<p>

You have to focus on the problem, and most of 
America hasn't done that because it's not a pleasant topic. 
It is very distasteful, especially as women, to work in 
this area.  But if we don't do it, our children and 
grandchildren will suffer because we haven't.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right. I know that you all are both 
really concerned because of the Internet and its effect on 
children.  I mean, as easy or difficult as pornography may 
have been to get before, now you can type in a word, a 
single word, like "sex" or "zoo," and get all kinds of 
horrible bestiality or any kind of molestation information 
coming up.

<p>

I was really disturbed to learn recently that 
there are some words on the Internet which are common, like 
"recipe" or the most common words that someone might type 
in, that pornographers have been putting those common words 
on their screens just to bring up the pornography, even if 
their screen has nothing to do with it.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: If Clinton really does have the 
Internet in every school in America, what are you all going 
to be concerned about?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, we are very, very concerned.
In fact, Enough is Enough has revised its whole strategic 
plan to focus at this point in time on making the Internet 
safe for children.  That is a huge job, but it is a growing 
technology, and with, as you say, every child being able to 
have access to a computer by the year 2000, which is four 
years away, every parent and grandparent and teacher in this 
country ought to be concerned, and we ought to be doing 
everything we can to address that.

<p>

We feel, frankly, that it is going to take a 
multifaceted approached.  We need tough legislation with 
aggressive law enforcement.  We need an educated public, 
especially parents.  We need a technology industry that 
becomes family-friendly, and I think that is not only a 
civic responsibility, but I think it is a good marketing 
approach, and I think we are going to see more of that as 
time goes by.

<p>

We will need an international coordinated effort 
as time goes by, also, because it is an enormous problem.
It is not just in the United States where there is concern; 
it is growing around the world.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Cathy, I know you and I 
have talked about this on occasion, but there has been a sad 
increase in molestation and rapes of children, of younger 
children, 8-year-olds molesting 4-year-olds and 7-year-olds 
and infants.  I mean, we are really seeing little children 
with not a -- and what has been interesting in some of the 
cases is their arguing that the children did not have 
criminal intent because they didn't understand, although 
they did act out a sexual molestation of a younger child.
Is it accurate to say that pornography on very young 
children has even a stronger effect than on adults?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Well, it can.  It can absolutely 
have a stronger effect, and I think that what this 
highlights is how many liberal activists like to experiment, 
frankly, with our children, experiment with their new 
agenda.

<p>

The American Library Association, for instance, as 
a matter of policy, says it will never use screening 
mechanisms on computers in libraries, even when a child as 
young as 10 years old or younger sits down at that computer.

<p>

In my opinion, that is a reckless disregard for 
children, and that is really experimenting with their lives. 
And then when we see these cases, we can see how truly 
devastating this can be for children.

<p>

There are many other ways in which we sort of 
experiment with children with pornography.  It is absolutely 
dehumanizing.  In the recent case on computer pornography, 
we saw ACLU experts come up on the stand and say, "I show my 
5-year-old hard-core pornography."  This is supposed to be 
some sort of psychologist, sexologist, or something.  And he 
was applauded, and he was one of their star witnesses.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is amazing.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Yes, it sure is.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Now, this is just completely 
unhuman, and we seem to have checked out our common sense at 
the door on some of these issues with kids.

<p>

But pornography can completely ruin a child's 
impression of the world, himself, his body, other people, 
and it's like a poison, and we've got to be careful not to 
feed kids.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're going to have to hear more 
about this in a moment.  Following this commercial break, 
we'll continue our discussion, and we hope you'll stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Joining me tonight to talk 
about Pornography Awareness Week is Dee Jepsen, president of 
the Enough is Enough Campaign, and Cathy Cleaver, the Family 
Research Council's director of legal policy.  Welcome back 
again to our show.

<p>

You know, one thing that really struck me about 
the pornography discussions, we have all agreed, on a whole, 
in a society that some information is not appropriate for 
children.  You know, we no more give children guns, even 
though guns are legal in certain settings, or medicines, 
even though certain narcotics are legal in certain settings, 
than we give them pornography.  You can't sell it over a 
counter, or in a video store they couldn't check it out.

<p>

But on the Internet, I was shocked to learn 
recently that it is legal to e-mail a child the most graphic 
obscenity, and there is no law to stop it; that somehow on 
the computer world the law is void or suspended or 
something.  How do we explain that?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: It is a very difficult thing to deal 
with, and Cathy might talk about some of the legal 
intricacies of it.  But we have had some victories in recent 
days. We were able to see the Communications Decency Act 
passed.  It is now being challenged in the courts and will 
be going to the Supreme Court.  Cathy probably knows more 
about that than I.  And we also saw a bill pass that made 
computer-generated child pornography illegal, just like 
child pornography per se is illegal.

<p>

Today, you look at modern movies and you see how 
that which you know is not real becomes real before your 
eyes, and they can do that on the computers, and that 
material is still used in the same way that other child 
pornography is used by pedophiles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So, basically, although we know 
there were no dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, they could create 
them.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So if you created children for 
obscene pictures, that also would be illegal.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right. That's right, and this 
material now being available by computer makes every home 
and school and library, every place there is a computer 
outlet hooked to the Internet, a site of delivery or 
distribution for pornography.  That is an appalling 
situation.

<p>

Cathy mentioned earlier about those within the 
library community that do not want to have any kind of 
filter system so children cannot -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And that's our taxpayer-funded 
libraries, too.  I mean, let's be clear.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  That's right.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: But some of these very same people 
would be so supportive of trying to create a risk-free 
environment in the area of toys and everything else that 
children are involved with, and they want quality control on 
everything, and I am not knocking that at all.  All I am 
saying is, this is what we are pouring into children's 
minds, and somewhere logic has become convoluted in that 
whole argument.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: We really treat both pornography, 
which we have been struggling with, and now the Internet 
with kid gloves, I think.  In the next few months we are 
going to be seeing at the Supreme Court the ACLU and other 
pornography magazine distributors, their challenge against 
this computer pornography law.  So there are many anti-pornography 
groups -- Enough is Enough, Family Research 
Council, and others -- who are trying to defend this law 
because it makes sense.

<p>

Guccione, the publisher of <i>Penthouse</i>, is now 
filing suit, we understand, against the military anti-pornography 
law, which says that we ought not sell pornography on our military bases.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: At a discounted rate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: At a discount to our servicemen, yes.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: So that makes sense.  The law makes 
sense.  The challenge doesn't make any sense.  But it's a 
constant battle.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's where he makes his money.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: That's where he makes his money, so 
it makes sense to him.  There is a battle in our courts 
always, and there is a really a battle for the hearts and 
minds of the people of our society.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, here is an interesting 
counter to that.  Let's look at what has happened in 
television.  You have the President for the V-chip, 
assuming, of course, that the government decides what should 
be blocked as violence.  And you've got all of these so-called 
child advocates favoring pornography and pornography 
distribution, but on the other hand saying we must mandate 
more educational television, and we must govern advertising 
on television for its impact on children; we have to be 
harsher on cigarette and alcohol ads, so that even the 
presence of Joe Camel on a race car is anti-child.

<p>

And these same people who seem to think that Joe 
Camel on a race car will drive children to smoking don't 
think that killing people in a slasher film will have any 
effect on them at all.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That is a great example.  That is 
exactly right.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  But I really 
believe, if we talk about it long enough, that the American 
public are finally going to have the light bulb go on, and 
they are going to say, "Wait a minute.  There's something 
wrong here, and we're going to have to do something about 
it."

<p>

You know, homes and libraries and schools across 
this country should be at least installing blocking 
technology, and now there is new technology that can be 
installed, second generation, at the server level.  And we 
are going to be doing everything we can to get that done.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We just have a couple minutes left. 
Tell us how people could find out about that.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, one thing they could do is 
contact our office.  That telephone number is 703-278-8343, 
and we could get material to them.  We would be happy to do 
that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There is a little bit of technology. 
I know Cathy has been concerned about how thorough it can 
be, but it would be something.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That is right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It should be done.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: It's a beginning.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It's a beginning. Many parents have 
decided simply not to have the Internet in their homes if 
they have children.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: We hear it all the time.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: And if I had children, right now, I 
don't think I would have the Internet in my home.  The 
software blocking mechanisms are very inadequate, and it 
only takes one picture to really assault a child.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: And so you might want to consider 
that if you are a parent now with kids, just not bringing 
the Internet in your home until it gets better, until these 
laws start to be enforced.  But at all costs, you ought to 
employ, find out which software blocking program is 
esteemed.  Enough is Enough has some ideas about which ones 
are good programs, and they are a good resource for parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to have people 
call us for that information.

<p>

I would like to thank both of you, and this is not 
over.  I know the court case is going to come up the first 
of the year, and we are going to want to hear back.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will present 
another aspect of how this year's campaigns address women 
and the so-called women's issues.  Stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

I was fortunate to join the discussion at The 
Heritage Foundation, which you caught a glimpse of earlier 
in the show. These panels showed that there really are no 
kneejerk women's positions, although two issues, education 
and the life issue, are usually played as if there are.
Let's see how those issues unfold as <i>Straight Talk</i> presents 
some Homefront News.

<p>

<p>

[Segment from The Heritage Foundation Conference 
entitled "Women, Politics, and the 1996 Elections," held 
September 27, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I want to just put forward that 
there are two issues that I am going to address that I think 
are fundamental to our natures as women.  Harkening back to 
this obsession with feminine hygiene, I think there is 
something true about women's fundamental physical nature 
that makes you very practical about your children and about 
not just the children that you have but that you could have 
or that other women are having, that we are regularly 
reminded that we are not alone in the world, that we have a 
generation to think about before us and that we come from 
something, and I think it makes women, in particular, very 
practical.

<p>

There are two issues that I wanted to address that 
I think are fundamental issues for their importance to 
women, although I don't want to box them in as women's 
issues, but also the problem with them, from my perspective, 
and that launched me on a heated diatribe with Karen, was 
the way in which they are discussed.

<p>

Those issues that I think are very interesting to 
women are education and life.  And again, because of their 
fundamental connection to our interest in children and to 
our interest in our society's longevity, it is a long-term-thinking 
approach.  Both education and the life issue 
connect us to the future.  Both of them say that we are 
going to be building something and we are concerned about 
it.

<p>

But what irritates me about these two issues is 
that they are described in such kneejerk fashion, and I 
didn't get a chance to ask this question, but I think that 
women, in particular, have to be a little more irritated 
with the way in which the debate goes, because its competing 
slogan -- education, tax thing, you know, education, 
program, education this, education that -- as though somehow 
we are too unintelligent, A, to make our own decisions, B, 
to understand a greater context of the debate.

<p>

And so on the issue of education in general, at 
Family Research Council, I will tell you right up front, we 
think that people are smart enough to choose schools that 
have opportunity, and to take tax dollars and set them up as 
a sacred cow in a school system in which you have no input, 
in which groups like the People for the American Way or the 
American Library Association will label your calling the 
school an act of censorship, not because anything happened 
but because a parent accidentally got involved in the 
process, that somehow this is an offense to the educational 
system because you had a thought about your child's 
education.

<p>

And so what we have tried to do in terms of the 
education debate is say, look, people are intelligent.  They 
can make intelligent decisions, and the education debate is 
so jargon-full and practicality-absent.

<p>

And so what I wanted to say to the Dole campaign, 
if they were listening, is it's not to talk about education 
but to talk about it specifically and with compassion, 
because I don't think that Bill Clinton wins in the 
specifics, but I think sometimes he wins in the compassion, 
that as women we are very concerned about what happens to 
our children, and sometimes the green-eyeshade approach, 
which is a Republican-heavy approach, doesn't cut it for us.

<p>

I am not per se -- I can tell you for myself, if 
the money that my husband and I paid out in tax dollars was 
effective, I probably would be thrown out of the Republican 
Party for saying, "Well, sure, it's a lot, but, you know, 
they're doing something."

<p>

But the problem with a lot of people is they're 
taking a lot of my money and doing nothing.  They're doing 
nothing.  It is not just that my money disappears but that 
it ineffectively disappears.

<p>

I have been working for the end of the Department 
of Education for a long time, and I want to tell you why.
Seven cents out of every dollar spent in the local school 
comes from the Federal Government, but the majority of the 
mandates for education come from the Federal Government.  So 
for a toehold of dollars, we get a barrelful of policies, 
and none of them to our liking.

<p>

We have 150 education programs; 16,200 employees 
here in Washington, D.C.; a budget of more than $3 billion, 
bigger than five other departments, and for that we get 
nothing.  We get nothing.  And what I am arguing is that 
education might be a fundamental interest to us, but if you 
don't explain why what you are doing will help people do 
better, it is insignificant if it is less expensive, and 
that that is a problem with the education debate today.

<p>

In the same token, I am unimpressed with Bill 
Clinton's, "How about $1,500 for a trade school of any 
kind?"  Well, what if I didn't want to do that?  What if I 
had different goals for my money?  Why should Bill Clinton 
dictate for me where I spend my education goals, because 
then the government still is making choices for me.

<p>

The way that we have to talk about education 
today, though, has to be both pragmatic and specific and 
compassionate.  We cannot merely be cutting the dollars.  We 
have to be talking about where they're going to go.

<p>

I, for one, am a gigantic advocate of school 
choice, and you are always seeing people say, "Oh, you're 
going to get people out the process.  They are not going to 
get involved."  We have had several very successful school 
choice programs in the United States that didn't violate 
anyone's wall between church and state.  The first one was 
the GI bill, which educated a generation successfully and 
gave them money to go to the school of their choice, and the 
entire nation prospered.

<p>

The second one had to do with Pell grants and 
other educational grants that went to people to go to the 
school of their choice, and again, a tremendous success from 
choice.

<p>

In the same way -- let's not argue about the 
details today, because maybe we wouldn't all agree -- but 
can we not agree that people can make better choices and 
that it is not just the money but it is the way in which it 
is spent?

<p>

So I am a little annoyed sometimes by everyone 
trying to poke my woman button by mentioning education but 
not taking the time to explain how your program works, 
number one, and whether it is even a better use of my money 
than a couple of ideas that I have, frankly.  And so we have 
to start talking about education issues in a compassionate way.

<p>

And I go to the life issue again.  The research is 
clear, and I can go through the numbers but I will skip 
that, that women are pro-life (more) than men.  Again, I 
think it is a fundamental thing, that we understand 
something about what is happening on that area.  But again, 
I am painted as a caricature of myself in the public debate, 
and I reject it.

<p>

Partial birth, yesterday, I think, a very sad vote 
in which viable, healthy children can be stabbed in the base 
of the skull in the name of choice.  Even if a person is for 
abortion, is there no line that goes too far?  Is this the 
oozy of the NRA, frankly?

<p>

But let me take a look at a different abortion 
issue from the standpoint of a woman, and that is RU-486.
Let's say that you really think there should be abortion 
somewhere along the line.  So let's just say, yeah, we want 
abortions to be safe, legal, and rare, but certainly safe.
So we see the Clinton Administration lobbying for RU-486,
which is a chemical abortifacient.

<p>

This morning on NPR I awoke to the very 
fascinating and meaningless knowledge that, in the 1960s, 
Procter and Gamble developed Olestra, which is a pretend fat 
substitute that they will now use to make potato chips, and 
the consumer groups are going to go to court to stop it 
because it might not be healthy, despite the fact that they 
have been testing it for 30 years.

<p>

And in a six-month test on RU-486 in which we 
don't understand its impact on women's long-term fertility, 
whether these drugs originally designed for cancer and for 
ulcers might build up and be a toxin in your system, whether 
there is any impact on your ability to have future children 
-- we don't know any of this, but you know, because it is 
abortion and it's a "woman's issue," we are going to force 
it through and we're going to have abortion, thank God, with 
this chemical.

<p>

I just want to encourage us in our discussion as 
women of the life issue and of the education issues to put 
our practical and our nature-oriented issues to bear and to 
ask harder questions of people.  I think these two issues 
are powerful as long as we discuss them pragmatically and 
compassionately.

<p>

<title>CARING FOR OUR CHILDREN</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>

<h2>CARING FOR OUR CHILDREN</h2></center>

<p>

A recent Census Bureau report states that the majority of preschool
children are cared for in a home environment while their mother
works, while school-aged children are typically in school during
their mother's working hours.

<p>

Sixty-three percent of preschool children of employed women spend
their mother's working hours in a home environment,[1] 51.8 percent
of whom are spending time with either their father or grandparent.
Of all preschool children, 15.9 percent are cared for by their
fathers while their mother works;  16.5 percent are cared for
by a grandparent.  Another relative cares for 8.8 percent of preschool
children.  Seventeen percent are cared for by a non-relative at
the provider's home.[2] Only 29.9 percent of all children under
the age of 5 rely upon an organized day care facility for care.[3]

<p>

This data also supports the finding that mothers of school-aged
children work part-time -- 74 percent of children between 5 and
14 years of age are at school while their mother works.  Six percent
of preschool children are with their mothers while they work.
A 1993 Roper poll conducted on behalf of Family Circle magazine
found that in 55 percent of households the child's parent or guardian
usually cared for children under 14 when they were not in school.
Twelve percent were cared for by a grandparent.  Comparatively,
13 percent were in a day care, preschool, or after school program
during non-school hours.[4]

<p>

Few statistics indicate how many children are in the care of an
at-home mother, even though it has been documented that children
reared at home by a parent fare far better in life-long cognitive
ability.[5] There are, however, some demonstrative statistics: 
40.2 percent of divorced, separated and widowed mothers of children
under 6 years old don't work, and 40.1 percent of married mothers
of children under 6 years old don't work.[6]

<title>PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTIONS: DISPELLING THE MYTHS</title>

<body>

<h2>PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTIONS:<br>
DISPELLING THE MYTHS</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

Pro-abortion forces, with the help of a sympathetic media, have
succeeded in spreading many myths and much misinformation regarding
partial-birth abortions and H.R. 1833, the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act.  The following information is intended to dispel the
myths and present &quot;just the facts&quot; regarding the practice
of partial-birth abortion.

<p>

<B>FACT</B>:  Partial-birth abortions involve aborting partially-delivered
babies from four and a half months into pregnancy up to even the
ninth month.  The procedure consists of partially delivering the
live baby feet first so that all but the head is outside the mother's
womb.  If the abortionist made a &quot;mistake&quot; and the baby's
head slipped out of the mother, the child would be considered
legally a person.  The head remains in the uterus while the abortionist
kills the baby by stabbing surgical scissors into the base of
its head to create an opening.  The abortionist then suctions
out the brain by a small tube (which collapses the scull), then
completes the delivery of the now-dead baby.  The legislation
would make it a crime to perform this procedure except to save
the mother's life.

<p>

<B>FACT</B>:  Although both Houses of Congress passed H.R. 1833,
the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, President Bill Clinton vetoed
the legislation on April 10, 1996.  On April 15, the bill was
referred back to the House Judiciary Committee.  President Clinton
defended his veto of this legislation by saying that he wanted
to protect the &quot;health&quot; of the mothers involved.  However,
&quot;health&quot; is so broadly defined in the context of U.S.
abortion law as to include &quot;all factors -- physical, emotional,
psychological, familial, and the woman's age -- relevant to the
well-being of the patient&quot; (1973 Supreme Court decision in
<I>Doe v. Bolton</I>).  Thus, President Clinton's position to
protect the health of the mother would not stop one partial-birth
abortion from occurring, and would render the entire bill meaningless.
In fact, the &quot;health&quot; position Clinton has taken makes
every abortion legal for whatever reason.

<p>

<center><h3>DISPELLING THE MYTHS: A TRUE OR FALSE TEST</h3></center>

<p>

1.  True or False:  Partial-birth abortions are performed only
in extremely dire circumstances, i.e., to save the life of the
mother.

<p>

FALSE -- According to Dr. Martin Haskell, an abortionist who has
performed more than 1,000 partial-birth abortions, about 80 percent
are done for &quot;purely elective&quot; reasons.  The other 20 percent
are done for &quot;genetic reasons,&quot; which includes such
non-life-threatening conditions as having a cleft palate or Down's
Syndrome. <B>(&quot;Shock-tactic ads target late-term abortion
procedure,&quot; <I>American Medical News</I>, July 5, 1993.)</B>

<p>

2. True or False:  &quot;Elective abortion&quot; means electing
an abortion in a tough circumstance rather than risking death.

<p>

FALSE -- &quot;Elective&quot; means that there is no medically
necessary reason for the patient to undergo a certain procedure.
 For example, cosmetic surgery such as a face lift or a tummy
tuck are considered &quot;elective&quot; procedures.  Thus, an
elective partial-birth abortion means that the mother could have
given birth to a healthy baby, but chose to abort her child.

<p>

3. True or False: Partial-birth abortions must remain legal
because it is the only safe procedure available to women at that
late stage in pregnancy if a problem arises.

<p>

FALSE -- According to Dr. Pamela Smith, the Director of Medical
Education in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Mt.
Sinai Hospital in Chicago, &quot;There are absolutely no obstetrical
situations encountered in this country which require a partially-
delivered human fetus to be destroyed to preserve the health of
the mother.&quot;  For example, performing a Caesarean section
could produce a healthy mother and living child.  But even when
abortion (producing a dead baby) is the aim, Dr. Warren Hern,
an abortionist who specializes in late-term abortions, says that
even he would not perform a partial-birth abortion because it
is unsafe for the mother.  In an interview with the <I>American
Medical News</I>, he notes that turning the fetus to a breech
position is &quot;potentially dangerous&quot; and that &quot;you
have to be concerned about causing amniotic fluid embolism or
placental abruption if you do that.&quot; <B>(&quot;Outlawing
Abortion Method,&quot; <I>American Medical News</I>, November
20, 1995.)</B>

<p>

4. True or False: Although grotesque, the procedure of suctioning
out the brains of the fetus is necessary, otherwise the fetus'
head would be too large to pass through the birth canal.

<p>

FALSE -- In an October 28, 1995 letter to Congressman Charles
Canady (R-Fla.), Dr. Smith said that &quot;cephalocentesis (drainage
of fluid from the head of a hydrocephalic fetus) frequently results
in the birth of a living child.&quot;  She adds that &quot;relaxing
the uterus with anesthesia, cutting the cervix (Duhrssen's incision)
and Caesarean section are the standard of care for a normal, head-entrapped
breech fetus.&quot;

<p>

5. True or False: In a partial-birth abortion, the anesthesia
the woman receives for pain actually kills the baby so that he
or she feels no pain.

<p>

FALSE -- During testimony before the House Judiciary Committee
in November 1995, Dr. Norig Ellison, president of the 32,000-member
American Society of Anesthesiologists, said, &quot;I believe this
statement to be entirely inaccurate.  I am deeply concerned, moreover,
that the widespread publicity given to Dr. McMahon's [a deceased
California physician who performed partial-birth abortions and
previously testified before Congress -- ed.] testimony may cause
pregnant women to delay necessary and perhaps life-saving medical
procedures, totally unrelated to the birthing process, due to
misinformation regarding the effects of anesthetics on the fetus.&quot;
Dr. David Birnbach, Director of Obstetric Anesthesiology at St.
Luke's Hospital in New York, said, &quot;Every day we have pregnant
patients who get anesthesia -- women who break their ankles, need
knee surgery, have appendectomies, gallbladder removals, breast
biopsies, and so on. Anesthetics done safely by an anesthesiologist
do not do harm to either the mother or the baby.&quot;

<p>

6. True or False: The under-developed fetus does not feel pain
from the partial-birth abortion.

<p>

FALSE -- Professor Robert White, director of the Division of Neurosurgery
and Brain Research Laboratory at Case Western Reserve School of
Medicine, Cleveland, told the House Constitution Subcommittee,
&quot;The fetus within this time frame of gestation, 20 weeks
and beyond, is fully capable of experiencing pain. Without a doubt,
this is a <I>dreadfully painful experience</I> for any such infant
subjected to such a surgical procedure.&quot; (Emphasis added.)
Paul Ranalli, M.D., a neurologist at the Faculty of Medicine
at the University of Toronto, wrote, &quot;Intriguingly, far from
being less able to detect pain, such premature newborns <I>may
be more sensitive to painful stimulation</I>.&quot; (Emphasis
added.)  He said that one study, regarding babies born under 30
weeks, indicates that it may be that &quot;the newly-established
pain system is 'raw' and unmodified at such a tender age.&quot;

<p>

7. True or False: Only pro-lifers supported the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act.

<p>

FALSE -- On March 27, 1996, the U.S. House of Representatives
passed the bill by a vote of 286 to 129.  The U.S. Senate, on
December 7, 1995, passed the bill by a vote of 54 to 44.  Many
Congressmen and Senators who are admittedly &quot;pro-choice&quot;
voted in favor of the ban, such as House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt (D-Mo.), Rep. Susan Molinari (R-N.Y.), and Rep. Patrick
Kennedy (D-R.I.).

<p>

8. True or False: The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act would force
women whose children had died in their wombs to keep carrying
them.

<p>

FALSE -- The word &quot;abort&quot; means &quot;to stop,&quot;
and an &quot;abortion&quot; is only an abortion if it stops a
progressing pregnancy.  If the child has already died in the womb,
removing the corpse would not ever be considered an abortion,
especially not a partial-birth abortion.  The Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act specifically defines a &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot;
as &quot;an abortion in which the person performing the abortion
partially vaginally delivers a <I>living</I> fetus before killing
the fetus and completing the delivery.&quot;  (Emphasis added.)

<p>

9. True or False: Partial-birth abortions are not a big problem
because so few are done each year.

<p>

FALSE -- Because abortion has been treated like a civil liberties
issue, rather than a medical one, abortion is not regulated with
the same kinds of laws governing medical care.  The numbers of
abortions performed, and the circumstances surrounding those abortions,
are made publicly available on the word of the abortion clinic
owners themselves, at their discretion.  We cannot verify the
number of late-term abortions done to children fully capable of
living outside the womb.  The public policy organization set up
by Planned Parenthood, the Allan Guttmacher Institute, is the
source often cited by the media.  What we know about the late-term,
partial-birth abortion, we have learned from the abortionists
themselves, describing their work to other medical practitioners
in publications like <I>American Medical News.</I>

<p>

10. True or False: It is illegal to perform abortions after
the first trimester (the first three months of pregnancy).  It
is also illegal to perform abortions for reasons like sex selection.

<p>

FALSE -- The 1973 Supreme Court decisions on abortion (<I>Roe
v. Wade</I> and <I>Doe v. Bolton</I>) <B>struck down</B> state
laws which protected the lives of unborn children.  The Court
did <B>not</B> provide any protection for the unborn, at any point
in pregnancy. Because of the &quot;health&quot; exception which
came from the <I>Doe v. Bolton</I> ruling, any abortion, at any
time, using any method, is effectively legal.  (Poll numbers show
that more than 70 percent of American adults do not know that
abortion is legal past the first trimester.)

<p>

11. True or False: If a woman experiences trouble late in her
pregnancy, she has to have an abortion or she may not be able
to have future children because her uterus may rupture.

<p>

FALSE -- The primary cause of sterility is blockage in the fallopian
tubes. According to Dr. David Stevens, a physician in Bristol,
Tennessee, sterility in a late-term pregnancy situation rarely
happens and is most likely to be caused by a ruptured uterus.
If the uterus is in danger of rupture, physicians usually drain
some fluid or proceed with a C-section. The normal course of action
would not be a partial-birth abortion.  A woman who experiences
late-term problems in her pregnancy does not need to fear blockage
in her fallopian tubes or interruption in her egg cycle, Stevens
said.

<title>TALKING POINTS: DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT (DOMA)</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>

<h2>TALKING POINTS:<br>
DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT<br>
(DOMA)</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert H. Knight</i></center>

<p><ul>

<li>Marriage is universal.  All cultures and all major religions
honor marriage.  Even though customs vary, it is always the bringing
together of the two sexes to form families.

<p>

<li>Homosexual couples are not the same as a husband and wife.
To say they are is to claim that men and women are the same,
with no appreciable differences, which is absurd.

<p>

<li>Marriage has already been so cheapened and undervalued that
homosexual activists now feel emboldened to deal the final indignity
-- separating the two sexes from each other.  No-fault divorce,
out-of-wedlock pregnancies and sexual promiscuity have weakened
support for marriage in the law and culture, with dire social
and economic consequences.  The answer is not to stretch the institution
further out of shape but to reassert support for the only model
that really works.

<p>

<li>Homosexuals are free to hold their own ceremonies, but when
they bring the law into it, they force everyone into it.  Under
the law, businesspeople would be forced to subsidize homosexual
relationships; children would have to be taught that homosexuality
is the moral equivalent of marital love, and anyone disagreeing
with the policy would be denounced as a &quot;bigot.&quot;

</ul><p>

<center><h3>A SAMPLE DIALOGUE</h3></center>

<p>

HOMOSEXUAL ACTIVISTS:  We just want the same things as you --
commitment, love, etc. You say you believe in &quot;family values.&quot;
Why not encourage us to form committed relationships?

<p>

ANSWER: You already can.  What you are asking us to do is to
pretend that two men or two women are the same as a marriage,
which they are not.  If you base these relationships on all the
qualities you just mentioned, why not demand that three men and
a woman be considered &quot;married?&quot;  Or how about a man
and a boy? Or two cousins?

<p>

ACTIVISTS:  You know as well as we do that that is not what we're
asking.  We just want to let two people who love each other have
the same rights as others.

<p>

ANSWER: You, like all citizens, already have the right to enter
into marriage by meeting that unique institution's central requirement
-- joining the opposite sex.  Once you break the one-man, one-woman
definition of marriage, there is no stopping point.  Several homosexual
activists have admitted that they want to redefine marriage so
they can enact the rest of the gay agenda.  Andrew Sullivan says
in his book <I>Virtually Normal</I> that gay male relationships
may be superior to marriage because gays understand the need for
outside sex.  So we are not even talking about monogamy here.

<p>

ACTIVISTS:  Right now, gay people can't visit their lovers in
hospitals.  They can't leave their property to their lover.  They
are denied a whole range of protections given to married couples.
We need marriage to be equal.

<p>

ANSWER: That is extremely misleading.  Like other citizens, homosexuals
can draft any type of will that they want and leave their property
to anyone they want.  Family members do retain a higher standing
in challenges to wills, but that is the case whenever a will is
contested by anyone.  The same goes for the powers of attorney.
A homosexual can designate his lover or anyone else as the executor
of his estate or as guardian of his health in the event of an
untimely, debilitating illness.  As far as hospital visitation,
that is not a federal issue, nor should it be.  Families have
been given preference in visitation because family ties transcend
other types of relationships -- as well they should. Homosexuals
are free to lobby individual hospitals as well as local authorities
to change their rules regarding visitation.  But they do not need
to overturn the institution of marriage to do so.

<p>

ACTIVISTS: What about married couples who don't have children?
Would you take away their licenses?

<p>

ANSWER: Marriage is a social good even without children, but
it overwhelmingly is about forming families, preserving kinship
and providing for future generations.  Exceptions do not disprove
the rule.  Besides, those couples who are childless can either
choose to conceive or to adopt to give a child a mother and a
father.  A homosexual couple by definition is motherless or fatherless,
and it is not in the best interests of children or society to
deliberately create motherless or fatherless families.

<p>

ACTIVISTS: Years ago, some groups supported laws preventing blacks
and whites from marrying and also keeping blacks out of the military.
They used all the same arguments then.   But we overcame their
prejudice and moved ahead.

<p>

ANSWER:  The Family Research Council and other pro-family groups
have always supported the civil rights movement, which is about
eliminating discrimination.  Second,  skin color and sexual behavior
are entirely different.  We don't know any former African-Americans,
but we do know some former homosexuals.   Jim Crow laws were invented
to keep blacks down, but marriage was not invented to keep homosexuals
down.  Equating the two is inaccurate and is merely a politically
expedient tactic.

<p>

ACTIVISTS: The lives of lesbian and gay people are under attack
all over the country by extremist groups.  They are trying to
shut down debate on gay marriage by passing unnecessary and mean-spirited
laws.

<p>

ANSWER: Pro-family Americans are not radically trying to change
marriage or force homosexuals to recognize a radical new institution.
It is extremist to pretend that two homosexual men are the equivalent
of a man and a woman, biologically, psychologically and socially.
Two men cannot provide the same experience as a mother in a child's
life, and a father cannot be replaced by two lesbians.  No culture
has sanctioned the homosexual relationship as &quot;marriage,&quot;
because it is not marriage.

<p>

ACTIVISTS: DOMA and these state laws are not necessary.  Full
faith and credit has worked fine for many years.  Extremist groups
are reacting to something that hasn't even happened yet.  This
is an attempt to shut off debate.

<p>

ANSWER:  Why should we wait until unelected judges in Hawaii impose
their views on the rest of the American people?  What's to stop
some other radical judge somewhere else from trying this?

<p>

ACTIVISTS: These are nothing but ugly attempts to use the federal
government to discriminate against gay people.  Are you telling
us that big government should be telling the states what to do?

<p>

ANSWER: DOMA allows the states the freedom NOT to have another
state's radical redefinition of marriage imposed on them.  In
no way does the federal government tell the states what to do.

<p>

ACTIVISTS:  This is just an attempt to stop debate on the topic.
It's an attempt to shut down the public dialogue on this issue.

<p>

ANSWER: Who was trying to keep the issue off the ballot in Hawaii
and elsewhere?  Homosexual lawyers with the American Civil Liberties
Union and the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund have tried
to squash ballot measures in Maine, Colorado, Washington State
and elsewhere.  They are trying to force their agenda on America
by judicial fiat.

<p>

ACTIVISTS: This is extremist!

<p>

ANSWER:  Do you really think that name-calling can substitute
for a sound argument?  Polls show that about 70 percent of the
American people oppose same-sex &quot;marriage,&quot; and in Hawaii
it is rising.  At last count it was 74 percent.  The more people
know about it, the more people oppose it.  Are all these people
extremists?

<title>WHY SO MANY AMERICANS OPPOSE THE CAREERS BILL</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>

<h2>WHY SO MANY AMERICANS OPPOSE<br>
THE CAREERS BILL</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) recently circulated a &quot;Dear Colleague&quot;
letter expressing his concerns about the education agenda embodied
in Goals 2000, School-to-Work, and most recently, CAREERS.  In
defense of their CAREERS legislation, Rep. Bill Goodling (R-Pa.)
and Rep. Buck McKeon (R-Calif.) sent a &quot;Dear Colleague&quot;
letter which attempted to address Mr. Hyde's concerns.

<p>

Regrettably, neither the Goodling/McKeon responses nor the changes
made to the CAREERS bill since its introduction have resolved
the central issues that trouble Mr. Hyde, pro-family groups, conservative
economic groups, and thousands of families across the country.
The following central provisions are unacceptable:

<p>

<b>The creation of a workforce development infrastructure.</b>
The CAREERS bill requires the creation of state and local workforce
development boards that will oversee all aspects of the &quot;seamless
system&quot; of workforce development.  These boards will be appointed,
not elected.  The system has more resemblance to centrally planned
industrial policy than to the American free market tradition.
The jurisdiction of the workforce development boards will include
programs for in-school youth, thereby infringing on the authority
of locally elected school boards.

<p>

<b>The Labor Market Information System (LMIS).</b> This system
would include &quot;<B>comprehensive</B> information on the socioeconomic
characteristics, and current employment status of the population,
including self-employed, part-time, and seasonal workers&quot;
(Title II, Sec. 21-22).  The Senate bill even requires the collection
of social security numbers so that wage data may be maintained
on individuals.  Furthermore, this national LMIS would be controlled
at the federal level by the U.S. Secretary of Labor.  LMIS thus
poses an ominous threat to personal privacy and should be rejected
on that basis.  But even if LMIS did not invade personal privacy,
it would still be an underfunded mandate to states and an inefficient
mechanism for helping people get jobs.  Why should the government
duplicate the labor market trend speculation already provided
by numerous employment agencies, trade organizations and business
journals?

<p>

<b>The inclusion of youth in a seamless system of workforce development.</b>
The needs of youth are much different from those of an unemployed
adult.  Vocational education should be a matter left to the local
control of elected school boards, not merged into a complex new
workforce development infrastructure.

<p>

We would welcome true block grant reform that would give states
authority to run job training according to their needs.  CAREERS,
however, <B>creates</B> a new system and more red tape by establishing
the workforce development infrastructure and expanding the Labor
Market Information System.

<p>

Following are some reactions to the responses made by Mr. Goodling
and Mr. McKeon to Mr. Hyde's letter.  The statements in italics
are taken directly from the Goodling-McKeon letter, including
their paraphrases of Mr. Hyde's concerns.

<p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Is the CAREERS bill &quot;designed to advance
the School-to-Work phase of Goals 2000?&quot;  Are the roots of
this legislation tied to the work of the Clinton Administration?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: No.  CAREERS is the product of Republican
efforts going back to the Reagan and Bush Administrations.  It
incorporates suggestions by a bipartisan coalition of reform-minded
colleagues, including many leading Republican Governors.</i>

<p><ul>

<b>I.</b> Don't forget the liberal ideas embodied in CAREERS.
Soon after Mr. Goodling introduced his National Workforce Preparation
and Development Reform Act (H.R. 2943), predecessor to CAREERS
in the 103d Congress, Sen. Ted Kennedy introduced a similar measure
in the Senate, the Job Training Consolidation and Reform Act (S. 2516).

<p>

According to <I>Congressional Quarterly</I> &quot;key components
of H.R. 2943 [Mr. Goodling's bill] were similar to language in
H.R. 2884 (<B>School-To-Work Opportunities Act</B> of 1993),&quot;
which the House passed on Nov. 15, 1993.  School-to-Work was President
Bill Clinton's second major education initiative.  Goals 2000
was the first.  CAREERS carries on the national system of workforce
development in School-to-Work and Title V of Goals 2000 (the National
Skill Standards Act of 1994).

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Does CAREERS reference Goals 2000?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: No.  Nothing in this bill requires any State
to participate in Goals 2000, or to adopt education standards
or related education programs.</i>

<p><ul>

<b>II.</b> CAREERS would require a state to participate in a
program much like that of Title V of Goals 2000 (the National
Skill Standards Act of 1994).  Under this title, the National
Skill Standards Board is charged with developing a national system
of skill standards, skill certificates and skill assessments.

<p>

These elements are undeniably present in the CAREERS bill.  CAREERS
cites the National Skill Standards Board [Sec. 108(c)(3)], supports
government involvement with industry-approved standards [Sec.
110(f)(1)(D)] and supports the creation of skill certificates
[Sec 5(41)].

<p>

Of course there is no overt reference to Goals 2000, but the philosophy
of Goals 2000 is present in CAREERS:  &quot;experts&quot; and
government join together to recognize national standards which
are to be emulated by state and local participants as they fulfill
the requirements of the act.

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Does CAREERS require funds be used to implement
tech-prep, career counseling, or other career-related programs
at the earliest possible age?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: No. Prior to House floor consideration,
all references to elementary education and to serving youth &quot;at
the earliest age possible&quot; were deleted from the bill.</i>

<p><ul>

<b>III.</b> Actually, Mr. Hyde's letter expressed this
concern about the <I><B>Senate bill</B></I> (S. 143), where career
guidance and counseling at the earliest possible age are still
<I><B>mandated</B></I> [Sec. 106(b)(3)].

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Does CAREERS require youth to pass &quot;performance
outcome assessments determined by the National Skill Standards
Board,&quot; that would replace high school diplomas?  Or require
that students at age 16 (10th grade) be placed in either vocational
training classes or apprenticeships?  Does CAREERS require that
students who are not prepared to enter vocational classes by age
16, be &quot;placed in youth centers&quot;?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>:  Absolutely not. Neither the House CAREERS
Act, nor the Senate workforce legislation contain any such requirements.
Neither bill mentions &quot;10th grade assessments,&quot; &quot;certificates
of initial mastery,&quot; or &quot;outcome-based education.&quot;
There is no requirement that students be tracked in vocational
or apprenticeship programs, or placed in &quot;youth centers.&quot;</i>

<p><ul>

<b>IV.</b> While CAREERS does not itself include these elements,
how does it guard against them?  This bill <B>will</B> advance
the work of the National Skill Standards Board, promote skill
certificates and certificates of initial mastery and shift American
public education toward a new model -- the <B>German</B> model,
as cited by staff last year.  Proponents of CAREERS have forgotten
that the bill is not entering a void and that implications beyond
its exact language must be considered.

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Why are industry-recognized skill standards
referenced in the bill?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: Because the youth title of CAREERS is not
broad education reform -- but is the consolidation and reform
of vocational education and job training programs for drop-outs
and disadvantaged youth -- we found it appropriate to ask that
these programs reflect the skill needs of local employers, so
that such education and training is relevant.  These are young
people who decide they want to get a good job at the end of their
school years (that may very well include postsecondary education
and training)....</i>

<p><ul>

<b>V.(a)</b> To the contrary, it has not been made clear that
the CAREERS bill will not bring broad change to education as a
whole because the term &quot;in-school youth&quot; is not defined
in the bill.  Also, a &quot;comprehensive system of workforce
development and literacy&quot; [Sec. 101, purpose] implies that
it could involve everyone -- in school and out.  State plans must
tell how the academic and occupational skills of youth will be
developed [Sec. 221(1)].  No qualification is made to the term
&quot;youth&quot; in this context, so whether its authors intended
it or not, it is likely that regulation could require the inclusion
of <I><B>all</B></I> youth.

<p>

FRC and other groups have expressed concerns that students not
be steered into vocational fields.  <B>If the rationale for including
youth in this seamless system is to ensure that in-school &quot;programs
reflect the skill needs of local employers,&quot; how will the
steering of students according to employers' needs be avoided?</B>

</ul><p>

<i><b>RESPONSE (cont.):</b> Nothing however, requires States
or localities to use &quot;national&quot; skill standards, established
by the National Skill Standards Board.  There are two references
in the bill to skill standards adopted by the National Skill Standards
Board, and both are <b>voluntary</b>.  Such standards <b>may</b>
be used by States, in determining the performance of adult training
providers.</i>

<p><ul>

<b>V.(b)</b> The point is that CAREERS endorses the federally
funded work of the National Skill Standards Board (that is, creating
a national skill standard system) instead of repealing it.

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Will CAREERS require the award of skill certificates?
Can skill certificates be used to replace high school diplomas?
What are skill certificates -- are they same as certificates
of initial mastery?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: Certificates of initial mastery are <b>not</b>
referenced in CAREERS.  Skill certificates are <b>not</b> certificates
of initial mastery.  They do <b>not</b> take the place of a high
school diploma.  Skill certificates are <b>not</b> mandatory in
CAREERS.  Skill certificates are a portable credential that <b>may</b>
be awarded to individuals once they have attained occupational
skills at levels that industry has recognized as necessary to
do a specific job/occupation.  As previously cited, there is language
in the bill that specifically says that nothing in the Act can
be used to require any individual to acquire a skill certificate
or to meet industry-recognized skill standards.  Further, language
was added to the bill clarifying that skill certificates may only
be awarded to youth, <b>in addition to or in combination with
a high school diploma</b> or a G.E.D.  Further, skill certificates
are not imposed upon employers.  In other words, an employers'
use or recognition of skill certificates for purposes of hiring,
is <b>totally voluntary.</b></i>

<p><ul>

<b>VI.</b> In School-to-Work jargon, &quot;certificate of initial
mastery&quot; and &quot;skill certificate&quot; <I><B>are</B></I>
used interchangeably.  State applications for federal School-to-Work
grants alternate between the two terms.

<p>

When government gets involved in the creation of skill standards
and certificates to be considered in hiring, government has the
potential to become gatekeeper to the workforce.  Also, consider
the logic of the national skill standards system, written in law
(Title V of Goals 2000).  Skill certificates are useful only if
they give preference to the people who have them.  There is little
use in having a skill certificate system if it is not universal,
so it is highly unlikely that the system will stay voluntary for
long.  That is why many Americans were looking to this Congress
to <B>uproot</B> the national skill standards system begun under
Goals 2000 and the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994 and
are highly disappointed to see the same elements retrenching in
the form of CAREERS.

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Does CAREERS move us toward &quot;dumbing-down&quot;
education in the U.S.?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: No.  One of the few requirements under the
youth component of CAREERS is for the integration of academic,
vocational, and work-based learning.  This is to ensure that vocational
education and training for disadvantaged youth is not &quot;dumbed-down&quot;
-- to ensure that these programs stress academics as well as occupational
learning.  CAREERS also requires that secondary and postsecondary
institutions develop articulation agreements, so that students
in vocational education have access and are encouraged to go on
to postsecondary education.  Nothing in CAREERS discourages independent
achievement.</i>

<p><ul>

<b>VII.</b> Proponents of CAREERS have forgotten that the bill
is not entering a void, but an educational atmosphere of dumbed-down
academics and controversial values.  Mr. Hyde is right to communicate
the concerns of many parents that CAREERS could contribute to
such problems because the school-to-work agenda already in place
has detracted from the academic purpose of schooling.  Again,
it has not been sufficiently proven that CAREERS will be any different,
because its reach into education remains unclear and potentially
extensive.

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Does the CAREERS bill result in a &quot;managed
economy&quot; where federal, state, and local workforce boards
will control all job programs through one-stop or integrated career
centers?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: No.  The whole point of the CAREERS bill is
to empower individuals (through vouchers and a competitive system)
to make their own informed career choices, and to assist States
and local communities in making reforms in job training and vocational
education programs to meet individual needs.</i>

<p>

<i>In exchange for billions of dollars in federal funding for
job training and employment assistance, CAREERS does ask States
and localities to establish integrated career center systems --
easily accessible, single points of entry into local employment
and training  programs -- for adults in need of employment assistance
or job training, and for employers who are in need of workers.
The actual design for such systems is left entirely to the
State and local community.  co-located Career centers (some call
them one-stops) are encouraged, not required.  And they are locally-designed,
appointed, and managed -- <b>not federally-run or controlled</b>.</i>

<p><ul>

<b>VIII.</b> The state and local workforce development boards
mentioned in the concern above will not be elected and will therefore
not have to answer to voters.  The boards are charged with developing
a comprehensive education and workforce development system for
their communities.  Since it has not yet been clarified that CAREERS
will not affect all in-school youth, it may be assumed that these
boards will have significant authority over not only labor and
economic issues in their regions, but also over education.  Like
Goals 2000's establishment of appointed school improvement councils
at the state and local levels, such <B>workforce development boards
will take authority away from locally elected bodies such as city
councils and school boards.</B>

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Does CAREERS establish &quot;a computer-based
system that will track teachers' training and performance, school
performance, and ...students from pre-kindergarten through technical
training and into the workforce&quot;? Will CAREERS require that
&quot;all information will be made available to interested government
officials and prospective employers&quot;?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: No. The CAREERS bill does <b>not</b> allow
for the collection of private information on any individual --
especially youth.  Protections are included in the bill to address
this concern as follows...

<p><ul>

<li>Specific language restating Title 13 of the Census Act relating
to confidentiality of information was added to the bill prior
to its floor consideration.

<p>

<li>Specific language that states:  &quot;Nothing in this Act
shall violate the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act under
section 249 of the General Education Provisions Act and the privacy
and confidentiality provisions under section 22(b) of Title II
of the Wagner Peyser Act as amended by this Act,&quot; was also
added.

<p>

<li>Language was added requiring that all data collected as part
of the labor market information system be aggregate data from
the census and other public sources -- not personal information.

</ul><p>

<b>Adult Training Performance-based Program Information.</b>
There is language in the bill requiring States to collect performance
data on adult job training providers that want to participate
in the voucher program.  Such performance-based information is
necessary to allow individuals to make their own, informed career
choices.  Submission of such information is voluntary however,
required only if training providers want to receive federally-funded
training vouchers.</i>

<p><ul>

<b>IX.</b> The Labor Market Information System (LMIS)
database of workforce information is to be &quot;<B>comprehensive</B>,&quot;
supplying information on &quot;the socioeconomic characteristics,
and current employment status of the population, including self-employed,
part-time, and seasonal workers, and individuals with severe disabilities&quot;
and &quot;job vacancies&quot; and so on [Title II, Sec. 21-22].

<p>

Combine such an idea with the Smart Cards Gov. Miller boasts of
in Nevada and the Worklink electronic resume in other states --
both of which gather data on school children -- and Americans
are right to be alarmed about the potential for invasion of their
privacy and that of their children.

<p>

Though CAREERS' version of LMIS may not include data that invade
personal privacy, setting up this vast new database system to
be uniform throughout the nation is worrisome.  At any time in
the future, if government should decide to require <b>additional</b>
data on individuals, the LMIS will be at their fingertips.

<p>

LMIS is really a Catch-22.  On the one hand, to provide unique,
powerful data, LMIS would have to threaten personal privacy. 
On the other hand, if it is sufficiently watered down to protect
individuals, LMIS will largely duplicate the type of data already
provided by a number of trade and business sources in the private
sector.  Either way, LMIS should not be a government endeavor.
It's a waste of money.

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Will CAREERS require individuals to receive
a government chosen job, or require individuals to receive a government
card in order to obtain and to hold a job?  Would the bill require
employers to list jobs with the labor market information system,
or require employers to hire individuals who have received skill
certificates as a result of job training programs?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: No. The CAREERS bill does not tell individuals
what jobs or careers they must hold.  The bill has no references
to government cards or requirements for employment.  Individuals
have the freedom to select any job or career they want.  In fact,
CAREERS increases this liberty, empowering individuals through
the use of vouchers, to obtain the job training of their choice.
Further, the CAREERS bill does not place any requirements on
employers, for purposes of job listings, or hiring practices.</i>

<p><ul>

<b>X.</b> It bears repeating:  the Labor Market Information
System (LMIS) database of workforce information is to be &quot;comprehensive,&quot;
supplying information on &quot;the socioeconomic characteristics,
and current employment status of the population, including self-employed,
part-time, and seasonal workers, and individuals with severe disabilities&quot;
and &quot;job vacancies&quot; and so on [Title II, Sec. 21-22].
If those aren't requirements of employers, what is?

<p>

If it truly will be voluntary for employers to submit data to
LMIS, why should the government be doing this when the private
sector already provides sufficient labor market information supplied
on a voluntary basis by employers?

<title>CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT: QUESTIONS AND CAVEATS</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>

<h2>CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT:<br>
QUESTIONS AND CAVEATS</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<li><b>Can we expect child support enforcement legislation to
increase child support payments substantially?</b>

<p>

A 1992 General Accounting Office report found that 14 percent
of fathers who owe child support are dead and that 66 percent
&quot;cannot afford to pay the amount ordered&quot; because they
are not employed by legal activity.  Many of these delinquent
fathers are addicts, alcoholics, mental patients, or prison inmates.

<p>

On the other hand, Bill Harrington of the American Fathers' Coalition
reports that only between 5 percent and 10 percent of fathers
are &quot;deadbeats&quot; in the conventional sense, meaning that
they &quot;don't give one penny of support or one minute of their
time.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>Will draconian child support enforcement serve the best
interest of mothers and children?</b>

<p>

In 1989, after passage of the Family Support Act of 1988, about
20 percent of unwed mothers without support awards said that they
did not want awards and another 21 percent did not pursue an award.

<p>

A group of former welfare mothers explained to a reporter (<I>The
New York Times</I>, February 17, 1995) that &quot;they know better
than anybody what will happen if . . . the Government makes fugitives
of men who the women say do not have jobs or money to pay the
child support.  They say it is the children who will suffer for
this, that the men will come after the women and blame or beat
them for the punitive actions of the state.&quot;

<p>

The women in the interview concluded, &quot;The whole [welfare]
system is anti-family, first by keeping the father from the home
and then by pitting mother against father over child support poor
men usually cannot pay. . . .  'My son needs a relationship with
his father,' [one mother] said.  'That has no cash value.'&quot;

<p>

Restoring the fathers' physical presence in children's lives is
in fact the most reliable means of guaranteeing child support.
When fathers do receive visitation, almost 80 percent pay full
child support, on time.  When fathers receive joint custody, the
child support compliance rate exceeds 90 percent.  In studying
the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience, Youth
Cohort (NLSY) data set, economist Robert Lerman found that unwed
fathers who rarely or never visited their children were also the ones 
least likely to pay child support.  Those who later married were 
suddenly motivated to increase their earnings dramatically, even 
without additional job training, according to Lerman.

<p>

<li><b>What is the proper balance between fathers' rights and
responsibilities?</b>

<p>

Under current law, a father's legal rights may be heavily circumscribed
or completely thwarted by the mother's noncooperation.  One study
found that almost half of all mothers interfere even when the
father has won visitation rights.

<p>

Economist and social critic George Gilder describes both the danger
and the futility of increasing welfare mothers' independence at
the expense of fathers' rights.  &quot;Nothing is so futile,&quot;
he writes, &quot;as efforts to force men to support for life a
child they 'father' out of wedlock while abortion laws deny them
any power to determine whether the child is born and while the
welfare regime denies them any economic power to marry the mother.&quot;
The attendant frustration, Gilder warns, increases men's propensity
for violence.

<p>

If unwed fathers are to be legally obligated to pay child support
to women who are on welfare, it seems neither sensible nor equitable
to deny fathers access to the same job training and employment
opportunity programs to which mothers are entitled.

<p>

<li><b>Should the IRS be responsible for enforcing payment of
child support?</b>

<p>

Shifting the responsibility for child support enforcement to the
IRS raises the danger that failure to collect checks from delinquent
fathers will very easily evolve into remitting government checks
instead -- a proposal which has been floated in Congress in the
past.  Enforcement by the IRS is only one small step removed from
exchanging &quot;personal responsibility&quot; for new social
responsibility and from exalting government in place of family.

<p>

<li><b>What principles should be embodied in a positive alternative?</b>

<p>

The problem inherent in child support enforcement is, as social
scientist Charles Murray has said, that &quot;it is next to impossible
for anyone, including the state, to force a man to take on the
responsibilities of fatherhood.&quot;  The best child support
is an intact marriage, and policymakers should seriously consider
restoring the distinctiveness of marriage by making it once again
the sole legal institution through which parental rights and responsibilities
are defined and exercised.

<p>

Experts estimate that 30 to 40 percent of low-income men living
apart from their families still maintain a relationship with them
and that a large percentage of delinquent fathers fail to contribute
child support simply because they have no income.  We should consider
allowing fathers to satisfy the welfare reform work requirements
while mothers care for the children -- a measure that could increase
&quot;child support&quot; by rebuilding spousal interdependence.

<title>HOSPITAL VISITATION: A NON-ISSUE</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>

<h2>HOSPITAL VISITATION:<br>
A NON-ISSUE</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

Homosexual activists often say that a key reason they need same-sex
&quot;marriage&quot; is because they are denied hospital visitation
rights to see their lovers.[1]

<p>

Yet an informal survey of hospitals in the Washington, D.C. area[2]
and elsewhere reveals that no institution bars any visitor that
the patient cares to see.  When asked if a patient had been denied
the right to a visit by a homosexual lover, hospital administrators
responded with incredulity that it was even considered an issue.
None recalled anyone being barred from seeing a patient because
of the visitor's homosexuality.

<p>

Homosexual activists cite a single case in which a lesbian lover
was barred from seeing a disabled patient at a mental hospital
and then at home with the patient's parents because of the wishes
of the patient's family.[3] A Nexis search on July 1, 1996 revealed
no other cases in which a homosexual was barred from visitation
by a family.  Yet homosexual activists give the impression that
the problem is widespread and that the only way to overcome this
barrier is to allow homosexuals to &quot;marry,&quot; thus elevating
them to &quot;family status.&quot;

<p>

The activists also often claim that the patient's family has final
authority in all instances of hospital visitation.  But final
authority most often is the patient, who is permitted to define
the &quot;intimate circle&quot; of visitors.  In fact, patients
routinely see anyone they want.

<p>

Typically, the choice falls to the family only when the patient
is unable to make the decision.  Families rightfully have this
authority, since ties of blood, adoption and genuine marriage
outweigh other types of relationships.  This would apply in cases
where the patient is sedated or unconscious and has not made previous
arrangements (such as a &quot;living will&quot;).  The homosexual
&quot;hospital visitation myth&quot; is derived from such a scenario.

<p>

According to hospital administrators, an unmarried couple, heterosexual
or homosexual, can define their &quot;intimate circle&quot; in
writing in what is called a &quot;proxy.&quot;  That request will
be honored regardless of whether the patient's family agrees.
Patients can also grant power of attorney to homosexual lovers,
giving them legal authority and access equal to that of family.
As far as HIV-infected patients are concerned, courts routinely
have confirmed the visitation rights of  children to see an HIV-infected
parent (in or out of the hospital).[4]

<p>

The only person with higher authority than the patient is the
doctor.  If the doctor believes the presence of a certain person
will adversely affect the patient, then the doctor has the authority
to revoke that person's visitation rights, even if that person
is a family member.

<p>

These policies are not newly instituted concepts but have been
in existence for years.  In rare cases where patients feel they
have been inconvenienced by current policy,  redress is available
through appeal to hospital authorities, local law or through professional
medical associations.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

The homosexual movement's &quot;hospital visitation hardship&quot;
is an emotional smokescreen without foundation that is being used
to distract from the more serious implications of radically redefining
marriage.

<title>REAL WORLD FRIENDS</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">

<p>

<h2>REAL WORLD FRIENDS</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Larry H. Huff</i></center>

<p>

The producers of NBC's <i>Friends</i> deserve much credit. Since
it first aired, I have been a regular viewer and, like so many
of my peers, Thursday nights are often built around watching the
show with my own friends.
<p>
<i>Friends</i> is effectively scripted and produced.  The acting
is very good, the humor is both subtle and edgy, and they add
just the right measure of sappiness.  In short, it is very well
done, as evidenced by its number-one rating.
<p>
Another reason <i>Friends</i> is a hit is its relevance.  There
are tons of us whose lives, in so many ways, mirror those of the
characters.  We are young, single and dealing with life by facing
good days and bad, exceptional and mundane -- but all interwoven
with ribbons of humor, questions about our careers, and (of course)
romance. Sometimes we wish we could bottle these days and make
them last forever and sometimes we wish we had &quot;do-overs.&quot;
But whatever these days are like, many of us are fortunate enough
to walk through them with real-life friends, without whom life
would be much poorer.  This is the point on which <i>Friends</i>
is most compelling.  Its creators are to be commended on their
uncanny insight into our lives.
<p>
The one point at which the show diverges from reality is in its
portrayal of  moral dilemmas.  In episode after episode the producers
create life-like chances to demonstrate sexual propriety and nearly
every time, they fail.  The consistency with which they present
sexuality so tritely indicates one of two things:  they either
sell real-life people far too short, or they are working overtime
to thrust an &quot;it never costs anything and everything goes&quot;
view of sex upon us all.
<p>
This is not to say that sexual issues are not a significant part
of real life. But it is undeniable that  -- in the real world
-- sex for sport is not free, and most folks know it.  In the
deepest part of us, we know casual sex has an emotional and psychological
cost that is far greater than its momentary gratification.  Hence
the term we assign to the morning-after departure, &quot;the walk
of shame.&quot;
<p>
In the sobriety of the morning light, or when we're sitting on
our beds alone late at night, we are all too aware that there
is a hole in our hearts that sex alone can never fill. We also know 
that by acting as if sex can fill that void, we sure can enlarge the 
emptiness in our own life and in that of another.
<p>
As much as we may sometimes want it to be, we know sex is not
the way <i>Friends</i> portrays it.  We know a guy can't sleep
with a producer to get a part on a soap opera and then laugh it
off without losing his dignity and a whole lot more.  We know
a wife can't leave her husband for a lesbian lover and have the
&quot;wedding&quot; of the two women be warm and wonderful for
all concerned -- especially when their child will be raised by
her and her.  Good wit doesn't make everything okay, and one-liners
don't ameliorate the blisters random sex leaves on our hearts.
<p>
We know sex yields real freedom, safety, and lasting pleasure
only when it's enjoyed with the one friend to whom we have pledged
our life:  our husband or wife.  That friend doesn't have to go
home to shower before work, or wonder who might have shared the
same bed the week before.  That friend doesn't have to wonder
why her partner didn't call, or joke with the guys at the office
about not calling when he said he would.
<p>
So, despite the many ways the makers of <i>Friends</i> look at
our lives and seem to &quot;get it,&quot; when it comes to sex,
they obviously don't.

<title>JANE AUSTEN COMES TO AMERICA</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>JANE AUSTEN COMES TO AMERICA</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Brent Vukmer</i></center>

<p>

I fall in that demographic group, &quot;Guys who prefer <I>Home
Improvement</I> to <I>Masterpiece Theater</I>,&quot; but I recently
went to see <I>Sense and Sensibility</I> anyway -- and liked it.
I'm not the only one.  Emma Thompson's film adaptation of Jane
Austen's book has grossed more than $21 million in its first few
weeks -- not bad for a limited-release, highbrow movie.
<p>
Hollywood is in a Jane Austen frenzy.  Starting last year with
<I>Clueless</i> (an updated <I>Emma</I>) and continuing in a big
way with <I>Sense and Sensibility</I>, this unassuming Dead White
Female has taken center stage in Hollywood.  <I>Persuasion</I>
is now on movie screens nationwide.  Another version of <I>Emma</I>
will appear in 1997.
<p>
Suddenly, Jane Austen is all over American pop culture. <I>People</I>
magazine included Jane Austen in their list of &quot;The 25 Most
Fascinating People in the World.&quot;  Press coverage in <I>Time</I>
magazine, <I>The Washington Post</I>, <I>The New York Times</I>, and 
other major media outlets has all been glowing.
<p>
What's going on?  How is it that Jane Austen, one of the most
tradition-minded women ever, shares press space with the cast
of <I>Friends?</I>
<p>
Pondering the question in the January 29th issue of <I>Newsweek</i>, 
Evan Thomas' article, &quot;Hooray for Hypocrisy&quot; concludes
that America misses having a society &quot;in which people ...
minded their manners.&quot;
<p>
Is that it?  Are we nostalgic for &quot;a more decorous and polite
age&quot;?  The 3.7 million households that tuned into A&amp;E's
six-hour version of <I>Pride and Prejudice</I> after the Super
Bowl <b>could</b> be explained away as a mutiny on the part of
Austen lovers and Miss Manners fans, recapturing the TV remote
after suffering through the pro football season.  Jane Austen
has always been popular with that segment of the population that
likes &quot;romance...cleverness...and some nice scenery.&quot;
<p>
But Thomas misses the point, I think.  Emma Thompson's <I>Sense
and Sensibility</I> <b>does</b> have romance, clever one-liners,
nice scenery, and exquisite manners, but Jane Austen has something 
important to offer besides her <I>Masterpiece Theater</I> qualities.
Colonel Brandon and Elinor are the heroes of <I>Sense and Sensibility</I>
because they are <b>good</b>:  kind, brave, strong, and trustworthy.
They keep their promises and steer by fixed moral principles,
not feelings.
<p>
That sounds more like it.  Americans are hungry for virtue.  In
a 1995 survey, the Family Research Council found that 66 percent
of Americans believe our society is &quot;on the wrong track.&quot;
Sixty-one percent of those surveyed attribute this to &quot;the
breakdown in the family and a decline in values.&quot;
<p>
Our nation's leaders seem to agree with most Americans.  Newt
Gingrich is talking about renewing America.  Not too long ago,
President Clinton admitted to Ben Wattenberg that, as Wattenberg's
recent book proclaims, <I>Values Matter Most</I>.
<p>
Former Secretary of Education Bill Bennett's various books about
old-fashioned values have been on national best-seller lists for
more than a year.   More than two million copies of <I>The Book
of Virtues</I> are in print, along with one million copies of
<I>The Children's Book of Virtues</I>, and 600,000 copies of
<I>The Moral Compass</I> in its first three months.
<p>
The bottom line?  It's not manners, but morality, that's in demand.
Parents are concerned more that their children might turn out
cruel than coarse.  This makes sense, because when two preteens
recently threw a grade-schooler to his death from an eighth-story
window because he would not steal for them, something more than
bad manners was at work.
<p>
Some modern experts on love, sex, and decision-making -- people
like former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders -- assert that old-fashioned
morality is an out-of-date, ineffective prescription for society's
ills.  Out-of-date?  Even in Austen's tightly-edited version of
18th century life, single-mother households, premarital sex, and
illegitimacy were facts of life.
<p>
Is &quot;just say no,&quot; her prescription for the problems
of premarital sex, ineffective? William Bennett's wife Elayne,
a sort of 20th century &quot;daughter&quot; of Jane Austen, runs
a program called <I>Best Friends.</I>  It works with fifth- to
ninth-grade girls, promoting abstinence.  Out of the 400 D.C.
girls who have gone through the program so far, only one has become
pregnant.
<p>
Jane Austen was an entertainer, not a social scientist, but she
seems to have known something about home improvement that has
escaped Joycelyn Elders and other experts.  Maybe we <i>could</i> 
take a clue about love, sex, and the rest from her work.
<p>
Americans are flocking to Jane Austen movies because there aren't
many happy endings in our society.  For us, as Evan Thomas notes,
love, sex, money, and marriage aren't the ingredients for comedy.
&quot;Somehow,&quot; he says, &quot;letting it all hang out did
not bring freedom, just child-support payments, and the sexual
revolution bequeathed us AIDS and date rape.&quot;  Maybe the
experts should go to the movies.  Jane Austen's ideas make sense.
<p>
She knew that absolute truths make comedy possible.  The time-honored
traditions and codes that have always protected marriage and the
family provide a safe environment to pursue true love, to laugh
at life's follies, and to cry at weddings.  (Not that a die-hard
Tim Allen fan would ever go so far as to do <b>that</b>, of course.)

Murder rates may be down, but not among adolescents, according
to a recent Justice Department report.  Since 1965, there has
been a 467 percent increase in the murder arrest rate for 18-year-olds.
The future murder trends suggest ever-younger offenders.  Something
must be done.
<p>
On a typical day in 1994, nine teenagers in the U.S. were murdered
and 13 teenagers committed a murder, the report said.  According
to Attorney General Janet Reno, the problem of children killing
is likely to worsen because demographics show that the key at-risk
population -- 14- to 17-year-olds -- will increase significantly
in years to come.
<p>
In 10 years there will be 23 percent more teenagers and, given
current trends, murder could increase to 40,000 killings per year
 -- that's a 67 percent rise!   James Q. Wilson, co-editor of
the book <I>Crime</I>, said, &quot;So we should expect, unless
something changes dramatically, that the [now lower] crime rate
will go back up.&quot;
<p>
While social scientists cannot show definite cause-and-effect
relationships for murder,  they can demonstrate that certain conditions
highly correlate with the increase in juvenile violence.  For
example, parental absence increases a child's likelihood of future
criminal behavior.
<p>
A 1990 study by June O'Neill, a professor with Baruch College
of the City University of New York, shows that men from single-parent
families are twice as likely to commit crimes as men from two-parent
families. Robert Sampson, professor of sociology at the University of 
Chicago, notes that it is harder for single-parent families to achieve
the &quot;informal social controls&quot; that limit both crime
and victimization.  &quot;There are higher crime rates in places
where communities are not characterized by strong families,&quot;
he said.
<p>
Even children from two-parent homes suffer when both parents are
absent most of the day due to outside jobs.  A Justice Department
study concluded that parental supervision, attachment to family,
and consistency of discipline were the most important barriers
to delinquency and drug abuse.
<p>
Likewise, drug abuse which directly correlates with delinquent
behavior, is on the rise among adolescents.  Andrew Peyton Thomas,
Arizona assistant attorney general and former NAACP counsel, writes
in <I>Crime and the Sacking of America</I>, &quot;There is...an
undeniable relationship between crime and drugs.  Drug addiction
can both lower inhibitions among offenders and spur them on to
other crimes to finance their dependency.&quot;
<p>
A 1993 Justice Department study of 4,000 urban youths over a five-year
period identified a pattern leading to delinquency.  The study
found a direct connection between drug use and delinquent behavior.
<p>
Finally, most Americans blame pop culture as a third reason for
increases in youth violence.  According to the Family Research
Council's 1995 nationwide poll (conducted by Voter/Consumer Research),
more than nine of every 10 Americans believe the media affects
violent crime to some extent.
<p>
Robert McAffee, president of the American Medical Association,
agrees.  He said, &quot;If you combine television, motion pictures,
rap music and video games, there's a continuing influence of 
violence....[and] violence is indeed a learned behavior.&quot;
<p>
By age 18, the average child watches 100,000 acts of television
violence, according to Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles-based
child psychologist.  Before the end of elementary school, the
average child witnesses 8,000 television murders, Butterworth
adds.  This much violence has an undeniable affect.
<p>
According to an analysis of 275 studies, George Comstock, a professor
at Syracuse University, says that perhaps 10 percent of antisocial
and illegal acts can be linked to television.
<p>
Epidemiologist Brandon S. Centerwall told <I>Newsweek</I> last
December that without television there would be 10,000 fewer murders
per year, 70,000 fewer rapes and 700,000 fewer assaults.
<p>
The music industry also shares some of the responsibility.  Dr.
Joseph Stuessey, professor of music history at the University
of Texas, told the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, &quot;Music
affects behavior.  This simple fact has been known intuitively
for centuries.&quot;
<p>
Pop culture's music is laden with violence.  It has themes of
murder, maiming, raping, abusing and destroying.  Rap and heavy
metal are the worst, but others contribute to the promotion of
violence.
<p>
Dr. Sheila Davis, a professor of lyrics at New York University,
says songs &quot;are a potent force in the shaping of&quot; society.
&quot;Popular songs,&quot; she says, &quot;provide the primary
'equipment for living' for America's youth.&quot; No wonder
youth violence is rising.
<p>
Americans perceive that crime is getting worse.  Although overall
crime rates may be down, the face of crime is changing.  Citizens
feel less safe.  There's no quick fix, but strengthening the family,
boosting juvenile courts, stopping gratuitous media violence and
fighting drugs will help.

<h2>BOGUS ARMY STUDY CLAIMS<br>
WOMEN CAN BE AS TOUGH AS MEN</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</i></center>

<p>

Last spring, the Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine
in Natick, Mass., selected 40 civilian women between the ages
of 18 and 32 from the Boston area to engage in physical training
for 24 weeks.[1] Funding for the study came from a $20 million
Defense Department women's health research project, pushed by
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Co.).[2]
<p>
The study, which was released January 26, 1996, will certainly
be used by feminists to advocate removing more combat exemptions
for women.
<p>
For six months, these women trained five days per week and 90
minutes each day.   They lifted weights, hiked with backpacks
and ran twice a week.   The training was overseen by experts in
strength training and conditioning.
<p>
The $140,000 study found that after training, 78 percent of the
women could lift more than 100 pounds.[3] That qualifies them for
&quot;very heavy&quot; military occupational specialties which
are generally limited to men.  This finding would seem to cast
doubt on current female exemptions.
<p>
The volunteers increased their repetitive lifting ability,  improved
by one-third their time carrying a 75-pound backpack, increased
their aerobic ability by 14 percent and increased their hip and
thigh muscle strength and endurance dramatically.
<p>
Lori Gilstrap, a strength and conditioning coordinator with the
U.S. Olympic Committee,  said she wasn't surprised by the results.
She warned, however,  that women shouldn't be expected to match
men in strength because they have much lower levels of testosterone.[4]
<p>
Everett Harman, the Army scientist who headed the study, countered
that, &quot;You don't need testosterone to get strong.&quot; 
Consistent training and conditioning &quot;can be very effective
in improving the ability of women to perform physically demanding
military jobs.&quot;[5]
<p>
The study on its face is suspect, because it didn't include a
male control group which would have provided a comparison in change
in strength.  Had such a control group existed, it is likely that
the outcomes would have shown that a higher percentage of males
would have qualified for &quot;very heavy&quot; military specialties.
<p>
The study also failed to address the impracticality of  keeping
women at that high physical standard especially when they are
away from the &quot;artificial&quot; lab environment without barbells
and Olympic trainers.  Is it proposed that a cadre of special
staff be organized to sustain the level of strength and fitness
necessary for women to be effective in combat?
<p>
There are many reasons to exclude women from combat including
the fact that women typically lack the essential physical strength
and endurance for survival.  Numerous government studies have
advised against pushing women into physically demanding military
jobs.  A General Accounting Office report which was done in the
late 1970s found that &quot;a large number&quot; of women in the
military were assigned to specialties that were too physically
demanding.[6]
<p>
A 1982 Army study concluded that the Army's ground combat mission
would be hampered if women were continually assigned to tasks
they could not physically perform.   The study found that women
were only 58 to 78 percent as capable as men in five measures
of fitness.[7]
<p>
These studies are now being ignored.  Feminizing the Army is politically
correct.  During President Clinton's first three years the Army
has been radically changed to admit more women, even though there
is no compelling reason to do so other than to satisfy the demands
of political correctness.
<p>
Secretary of the Army Togo West cheers military feminization.
He has said, &quot;Readiness will improve [after lifting more
combat exemptions for women] because we will have a larger pool
of quality soldiers from which to draw to fill critical jobs.&quot;[8]
<p>
West's any-sex-fits-all view clashes with the advice of many experienced
leaders. As Desert Storm hero and commander General Norman Schwarzkopf
testified to Congress, &quot;Decisions on what roles women should
play in war must be based on military standards, not women's rights.&quot;[9]
Regardless of the logic expressed by senior military commanders,
feminists remain dead-set on putting more women into harm's way.
<p>
Sherri Boulay, one of the women in the new study, believes some
women can qualify for ground combat &quot;with special training
and skills.&quot;  Certainly a few can qualify, but the military
recruits by category, and women as a category lack the requisite
physical strength.  Why should the Army incur the burden of conducting
special training to qualify a small number of women when there
are fully qualified men already available?
<p>
Mixed-sex training was tried in the late 1970s and discontinued
because it hurt male performance.  Recently reintroduced mixed-sex
basic training has changed, however.   There is more emphasis
on technical than physical skills.  The physical requirements
have been relaxed.  Running is now done in lightweight shoes rather
than boots.  During the running of the mandatory obstacle course
recruits are allowed to go around the wall if they can't climb
it.  Overnight bivouacs may be canceled because of rain.  Marching
routes are changed to avoid tough hills.  Is the enemy listening?
<p>
Major General Gene Deegan, commander at the Parris Island Marine
Corps Recruit Depot, warned the 1992 Presidential Commission on
the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, &quot;If I were to
maintain the same intensity for [women in training as] the male
recruits, I would have a very difficult time recruiting any females,
and if my recruiting mission remained the same, I would fail in
my recruiting mission.&quot;[11] The question must be asked, &quot;Is
recruiting the mission or is fighting wars the mission?&quot;
<p>
Reducing the physical training demands for soldiers is ill-advised
even if it enhances cross-gender &quot;cohesion.&quot;  Cross-gender
cohesion is the goal of social experimentation.  It must not be
the goal of a lean, mean, fighting machine.  This ignores the
stark realities of the battlefield and the physical differences
between the genders.
<p>
The 1992 Presidential Commission ran a study to investigate whether
women could meet the same physical fitness standards as men. 
It found that only 3.4 percent of women achieved a score equal
to the male mean score on the Army's physical fitness test.[12]
<p>
Women experience more than twice the number of lower extremity
injuries and over four times the number of stress fractures, the
report said.[13]
<p>
Without special training, the commission found, nature gives women
only 50 to 60 percent of the upper torso muscular strength of
men.  They have 70 to 75 percent of the aerobic capacity of men.[14]
<p>
The United States Military Academy requires all cadets to complete
an indoor obstacle course test.   The test evaluates a cadet's
muscular strength/endurance, flexibility, agility, and coordination.
The average completion time for the 10 obstacles is 2:50 (min:sec)
for men and 4:05 (min:sec) for women.[15]
<p>
Even in the civilian world, rational minds recognize the fundamental
differences between the physical capacities of men and women.
Dr. Mary Lloyd Ireland, a Kentucky orthopedic surgeon, studied
why female basketball players suffer twice as many serious knee
injuries as males and six times more anterior cruciate ligament
tears.  She attributes the problem in part to the fact that women's
bodies are less-suited than men's to absorb the driving and pounding
of sports.[16]
<p>
Ann Loucks, an associate professor of physiology at Ohio University,
found that hard physical work coupled with a caloric deficit
may have long-term effects  -- damaging a woman's reproductive
ability and losing bone minerals, which could lead to osteoporosis.
Extended periods of hard labor and limited caloric intake are
common military conditions.[17]
<p>
Because of undeniable differences in speed, strength and endurance
between men and women, women will always be in greater danger
than men on the battlefield -- just as they are in some urban
&quot;combat zones.&quot;  In terms of modern-day combat, women
do not have &quot;an equal opportunity to survive.&quot;
<p>
Good physical condition is important for both sexes.  But the
most physically demanding assignments should go to men who are
genetically predisposed to handling the toughest tasks.  If special
training is offered, it should go to men to give them an edge
over our enemies.  Even the best and strongest females are unlikely
to match most male enemies.
<p>
America's military is on a slippery slope.   Feminists and their
supporters want to gender-neutralize the military by incrementally
ditching commonsense policies.  This latest study, which claims
that women can be trained to be like men, contributes to this
misguided ideology, weakens the force structure at its core, and
puts America's military personnel in peril.

<title>ON BEING AN AMERICAN</title>

<h2>ON BEING AN AMERICAN</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Gracie S. Hsu</i></center>

<p>

Immigration reform is a hot topic today, and it's mostly fueled
by the real concern that illegal aliens are taking jobs and undercutting
wages for American citizens.  But, in the zeal to combat illegal
immigration, there has been an unfortunate side-effect --  too
often legal and illegal immigrants have been lumped together under
the category of &quot;foreign-born.&quot;

<p>

This use of &quot;foreign-born&quot; is troubling because it furthers
the notion that legal immigrants are &quot;one of them&quot; and
not &quot;one of us.&quot;

<p>

But legal immigrants <I>are</I> &quot;one of us.&quot;  Virtually
<I>every</I> American -- whether first-generation American or
10th-generation American -- has an immigrant heritage.  Legal
immigration (whether in the 1780s, 1880s or 1980s) has helped
America flourish.

<p>

Henry and Eunice are two such examples.  In August 1961, Henry
arrived in America at the age of 25.  Having graduated from the
most prestigious university in Taiwan, he was one of a select
few to be granted student visas to the U.S.  He did not hail from
a privileged background (he was the only one of seven siblings
to attend college), but he wanted to come to America because he
firmly believed that America was and is &quot;the land of opportunity.&quot;
He was eventually enabled to come to the U.S. because his eldest
sister, recognizing the opportunities America would afford her
brother, generously lent him all the savings that she had earned
from her job laundering other people's clothes so that he could
afford the cost of his plane ticket.

<p>

Since Henry came to America with virtually nothing, he spent his
first night at a local YMCA.  On his second day, he contacted
another immigrant friend who helped him find a place to live and
a dishwashing job paying $10 a day.  Later, Henry met and married
his wife Eunice (a Taiwanese immigrant who came to America on
a student visa to study physics), and they both worked to pay his 
way through graduate school -- he as a dishwasher and lab technician, 
and she as a clerical worker.

<p>

Neither of them has ever collected welfare or sought financial
aid from the government.  Instead, these two immigrants have worked
hard to fulfill the American dream.  Henry has an accomplished
record as a professional cheminal engineer for more than 20 years
and now manages his own real estate enterprise.  Henry and Eunice
have become homeowners, and they helped found a church in Los
Angeles that now has more than 30 branches around the world.

<p>

While America has certainly granted this couple economic opportunity,
it has more importantly given them freedom -- freedom of speech,
religion, and assembly without fear of reprisal.  For example,
for many years, Henry was very active in calling on the United
States to acknowledge Taiwan as a free and independent nation
and to support its fledgling movement towards democracy.  But
while his political activism left him blacklisted by the ruling
Taiwanese government, he could freely express his views to American
politicians as well as activate others who shared his views on
the grass-roots level.

<p>

Henry and Eunice not only exercise the freedoms given to them
by the United States, they also recognize that &quot;freedom is
not free.&quot;  Thus, they taught their children never to take
these freedoms for granted, but to appreciate, cherish, and defend
them.  Perhaps that is why one of their daughters was the first
Taiwanese-American female to graduate from West Point and is now
a captain in the U.S. Army.

<p>

America is unique among nations because its citizens, unlike those
of other countries, are bound together not by a shared ethnic
heritage or a common religion.  Rather, Americans share a set
of principles and an idealism which inspired the Declaration of
Independence and the U.S. Constitution.  So while both Henry and
Eunice have learned to speak English fluently and their children
have all settled in areas far from the ethnic familiarity of Southern
California -- South Dakota, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C.
-- they are Americans not for these external symbols of assimilation,
but because they have pledged their allegiance to the common principles
which make America &quot;one nation under God, indivisible, with
liberty and justice for all.&quot;

<p>

Admittedly, America has not always lived up to these high ideals,
as Henry and Eunice can well attest.  Indeed, they have experienced
the sting of racism firsthand -- from being denied service at
restaurants to being ridiculed for their accents to even being
implicitly denied entrance into the residential community of their
choice because the real estate agent made it clear that she did
not want &quot;people like them&quot; moving into her neighborhood.

<p>

But the fact remains that this couple chose to adopt America as
their own country.  And because they chose deliberately, with
great sacrifice, they don't take its privileges for granted.

<p>

Historians have long acknowledged and celebrated the manifold
contributions of our immigrant ancestors to this country -- economically,
intellectually, demographically, and culturally.  But to my mind,
the most significant contribution of these two immigrants I call
Mom and Dad is that they modeled for me, better than anyone else
I know, what it is to be an American.

<title>A BURNING NEED FOR RECONCILIATION</title>

<h2>A BURNING NEED FOR<br>
RECONCILIATION</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

In the last 14 months, 19 black churches in the South have been
torched, and federal authorities have ample evidence that racism
is the motivation.

<p>

Americans of all races must reject such bigotry.  Reconciliation
must begin with the same institution that brought about racial
healing in the 1960s, the church.  A hint of how this might happen
occurred during a mass rally recently in the Georgia Dome.

<p>

On February 13-15, approximately 43,000 pastors met in the Georgia
Dome to remove the barriers of racism and denominationalism. 
Pastors of all races gathered to worship and be encouraged.  Bishop
Wellington Boone, a black pastor, told how the black community
often finds fault with itself, so much so that there hasn't been
spiritual renewal in the black community for more than 100 years.

<p>

Dr. Raleigh Washington said that the black community is wrapped
up in past problems that affect the present and future life. 
Following Washington's presentation, Dr. Jack Hayford, a white
pastor, spoke and asked all African-American, Indian, Hispanic
and Asian pastors to forgive the white man for how he has hurt
and offended them in the past.  It was a dramatic time as he asked
for forgiveness on behalf of all whites.

<p>

Later, Promise Keeper founder and former University of Colorado
football coach Bill McCartney urged church leaders to commit themselves
to racial reconciliation.

<p>

Although there has been some progress in racial reconciliation
since the 1960s, there are still serious, lingering examples of
racial division.  Two months ago, arson destroyed a black church
in Knoxville, Tennessee.  This was the fifth black church in Tennessee
to burn in 13 months. The church's charred remains revealed 
spray-painted, racist graffiti. After the church burning, a racist 
letter was circulated promising that if interracial relationships 
continued, white supremacists would embark on a reign of terror.

<p>

Dewey Roberts, the president of the Knoxville chapter of the NAACP
blames &quot;a strong racist element within the community,&quot;
the <I>Boston Globe</I> reported.  One of the pastors of the burned
Knoxville church, Rev. Jerry Upton observed, &quot;None of us
want to believe that this can happen in America in 1996.&quot;

<p>

That church burning wasn't Knoxville's only racially-motivated
incident.  There was an unsolved cross-burning last year.  Additionally,
in another part of Tennessee this month, three white men will
be sentenced under federal civil rights law for burning two black
churches a year ago.

<p>

Meanwhile, two black churches were destroyed in west Alabama.
The publisher of a west Alabama weekly newspaper,  John Zippert,
told the <I>New York Times</I>, &quot;I don't think any of this
was accidental.  I think these particular churches were targeted.
You have white churches in between all of them that were not
touched.&quot;

<p>

Morris Dees, the head of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery,
a nonprofit agency that tracks hate groups and tries to promote
racial harmony, dismissed Zippert's explanation.  This area in
Alabama is not where white supremacist groups thrive.  He suggested,
&quot;This is deer hunting season and you have a lot of hunting
clubs up there, and a lot of drunk white boys who might be angry
at not getting a deer,&quot; the <I>Times</I> reported.

<p>

According to the <I>USA Today</I> report, of the 19 church burning
incidents since January 1995, seven occurred in the last two months
in seven different states: North and South Carolina, Georgia,
Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Mississippi.

<p>

These church burnings have drawn national attention.  NAACP Washington
Bureau director Wade Henderson urged Attorney General Janet Reno
to initiate an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the
burned churches.  In a letter to Reno at the end of January 1996,
Henderson wrote, &quot;There appears to be a discernible pattern
which links the fires including the surprisingly large number,
and the fact that they have occurred at small, predominately black
churches in small communities.&quot;

<p>

Reno says she is investigating the fires to determine whether
they were racially motivated.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms is studying the incidents to determine whether there
is any organized and conspiratorial ring traveling from state
to state.

<p>

Meanwhile, seven Christian-based groups wrote Senator Orrin Hatch
and Congressman Henry Hyde, chairmen of the Congressional Judiciary
Committees, urging them to hold &quot;prompt hearings on the wave
of arson and other attacks on churches and church properties across
the United States.&quot;

<p>

Whether there is an organized conspiracy or these events are just
copycat incidents, they evince an unhealthy racial division. 
There must be healing and the church is central to the issue.

<p>

Just as the black church led the way in the 1960s, today's church
leaders of every color must answer the call and commit to healing
the wounds of racism that divide us.

<title>WHY MY SON SHOULDN'T FEEL LEFT OUT</title>

<p>

<h2>WHY MY SON SHOULDN'T FEEL<br>
LEFT OUT ON &quot;TAKE OUR<br>
DAUGHTERS TO WORK DAY&quot;</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>William R. Mattox, Jr.</i></center>

<p>

In an ironic twist, the Ms. Foundation is being accused of gender
discrimination for excluding boys from their third annual &quot;Take
Our Daughters to Work Day.&quot;  In fact, a number of major companies
-- including Ford Motors, Polaroid, Colgate-Palmolive, and Apple
Computer -- are sufficiently concerned about appearances of sexism
that they are pointedly inviting both girls and boys to the workplace
for &quot;Take Our <I>Children</I> to Work Day.&quot;

<p>

While these companies' &quot;gender-inclusiveness&quot; and respect
for &quot;diversity&quot; is certainly commendable, I don't plan
to bring my 7-year-old son, David, with me to work on April 25.
Don't get me wrong.  I think boys have no less need than girls
to learn about the importance of work.  I'm just not convinced
that the most important work I do is done in the workplace.

<p>

That's why I devoted a day recently to staging my own little celebration.
I call it, &quot;Stay Home With Your Son Day.&quot;  And it was
quite a blast.

<p>

The day began with breakfast, followed by a trip outside to the
driveway, where I had David help me with some of the routine car
maintenance tasks (checking the oil, adding some radiator fluid,
cleaning the dashboard, etc.) that I used to help my father do.

<p>

After we finished, David and I ran some errands together.  We
stopped by the candy store to pick up some chocolates for me to
give to my wife when she and I celebrate our upcoming wedding
anniversary.  And we dropped by the post office to mail some letters
and survey the newest stamps -- just as I used to do with my grandfather,
who was an avid stamp collector.

<p>

In the afternoon, David and I enjoyed one of our all-time pastimes
-- playing wiffle ball in the front yard -- and then spent some
time before dinner working David's USA map puzzle and reviewing
some of his latest school work.

<p>

But the highlight of the day came at bedtime.  After I tucked
David in and shared in his nighttime prayers, I reviewed with
David some of the day's activities and told him something I learned
from my father (who, no doubt, learned it from his dad).  Here's
what I said:

<p>

&quot;David, there are lots of things I don't know and that I'll
never figure out.  But one thing I've learned is that some of
the most important work a man ever does is the work of being a
father. It involves things like teaching your children new skills,
showing them how a man should treat the woman he loves, building
family memories that will last long after you're dead and gone,
and telling your children about the never-ending love of the Father
above.  Now, David, this may not seem like a big deal.  But you
are growing up at a time when many men seem to think that all
of life's greatest joys are found in building and doing and working
away from home. They don't seem to understand how important the
job of a father is. They don't know how much joy marriage and
children can bring to life.  And the crazy thing is, David, a
growing number of women are acting like these men.  They seem
to think the best things in life are found in the workplace, too.&quot;

<p>

And then, after I kissed David goodnight and headed for the door,
I turned to him and said, &quot;Someday, son, you're going to
be a man.  And when you are, I hope that you will have a job that
you enjoy and that you do well.  And I hope you will marry a woman
just like your mother and have children just like ours.

<p>

&quot;When that day comes, David, I want you to remember the things
we've talked about today.  I want you to remember to honor and
cherish your wife.  And to make time with your children a top
priority.&quot;

<p>

<title>LEAVING THE VULNERABLE OPEN TO ABUSE</title>

<p>

<h2>LEAVING THE VULNERABLE<br>
OPEN TO ABUSE</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Gracie S. Hsu</i></center>

<p>

It used to be that the man in every girl's life was her father.
He was her protector and provider, shielding her honor and ensuring
her safety.

<p>

But today, with the rise in illegitimacy and divorce, fewer fathers
are around to protect and defend their daughters' safety and honor.
With more girls lacking the love and attention that only a father
can give, more of them are willing to settle for perverse alternatives,
namely, seeking intimacy with predatory adult men.

<p>

Numerous studies, such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services' <I>National Health Interview Survey</I> (1988), have
found that children from disrupted families are at a much higher
risk for physical or sexual abuse than children from intact, two-parent
families.  Furthermore, children whose parents separate are significantly
more likely to engage in early sexual activity than their peers
from intact, two-parent families, according to a 1994 study in
<I>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</I>.
But the latest statistics are even more shocking.

<p>

For example, a recent study by the Population Reference Bureau
found that about two-thirds of births to teenage girls nationwide
are fathered by adult men age 20 or older.

<p>

State health figures in Massachusetts confirm this finding.  In
1993 (the latest data available), more than half of the state's
teen pregnancies were sired by adult men.  Almost 60 percent of
the fathers in 3,663 births to teen moms were men aged 20-29,
and another 139 births resulted from teen girls having sex with
men aged 30 and older.

<p>

Likewise, a review of California's 1990 vital statistics found
that men older than high school age accounted for 77 percent of
all births among high school-aged girls (ages 16-18) and for 51 percent 
of births among junior high school-aged girls (15 and younger).  Men over
age 25 fathered twice as many teenage births as did boys under
age 18, while senior high school boys fathered only 24 percent
of births among all teenage girls.

<p>

Additionally, the Alan Guttmacher Institute's 1994 report, &quot;Sex
and America's Teenagers,&quot; found that six of 10 girls who
had sex before age 15 were coerced by males an average of six
years their senior.

<p>

Fatherlessness, however, not only creates the environment for
more vulnerable girls, it also helps create more predatory males.
Research clearly shows that boys who grow up without fathers
are far more likely to engage in violent behavior and promiscuity
than those who grow up in two-parent homes.  Indeed, according
to a 1990 article by Nicholas Davidson in <I>Policy Review</I>,
60 percent of America's rapists grew up in homes without fathers.

<p>

While absent fathers figure prominently in this new phenomenon
of child abuse, they are not solely to blame for the devastation.
The &quot;village&quot; has also failed in its responsibility
to protect children.  For example, television and movies regularly
expose children to sexually explicit images, glamorizing sex and
violence.

<p>

Lax enforcement of statutory rape laws has also added fuel to
the fire.  Although renewed efforts to prosecute and punish statutory
rapists, such as those undertaken by California governor Pete
Wilson, are needed and ought to be encouraged, a law enforcement
strategy alone cannot stem the tide.  Prevention must be emphasized.

<p>

Some have proposed that the way to &quot;prevent&quot; this problem
is to expose children at progressively younger and younger ages
to more explicit sex education in the school, so that children
can learn how to protect themselves with condoms, etc.  But this
scenario is a textbook case in which the &quot;cure&quot; is far
worse than the disease.  Clearly, such an approach will only exacerbate
the problem.

<p>

For example, the results of the National Survey of Adolescent
Males published in the November 1993 issue of <I>Public Health
Reports</I> show that young males who were taught about birth
control were more likely to experiment with sex at an earlier
age than if they had been taught nothing at all.

<p>

Furthermore, and more significantly, explicit sex education tears
down the natural inhibitions and defenses of both young boys and
girls, leaving them vulnerable to sexual predators.  Indeed, it
is a well-documented fact that pedophiles often use pornography
to lure their young victims.

<p>

That pedophiles attempt to wear down the defenses of the young
through pornography is bad enough, but this type of desensitizing
is now systematically taking place within schools through sex
education programs.  Unlike the sex education classes which parents
may remember, sex education today is explicit, graphic, and is
being taught in coed settings.  In fact, the Sex Information and
Education Council of the United States (SIECUS), a federally-funded,
nationally-recognized organization, has issued national sex education
guidelines which promote teaching kindergartners about masturbation
and junior and senior high school students about the &quot;benefits&quot;
of pornography, among other topics.

<p>

This current trend of adult men impregnating teenage girls is
a natural consequence of family breakdown and the sexualization
of children.  But what children need now -- and have always needed
-- is for adults to protect their innocence.  They need fathers
and mothers who will love and supervise them, laws that punish
statutory rapists, and school programs which do nothing to harm
the value, sanctity, and sacred mystery of sex.  Only then can
this tide be turned.  And if we are to survive as a society, it
must.

<title>GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT PUSH ANTI-WOMAN MATERIAL</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">

<p>

<h2>GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT PUSH<br>
ANTI-WOMAN MATERIAL</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S. Army, Retired)</i></center>

<p>

In a recent letter, a female U.S. Army officer based in Bosnia
told the Family Research Council that pornography &quot;degrades
the command atmosphere of respecting fellow soldiers and adds
to the possibility of misconduct....It is offensive to women serving
in the armed forces to be subjected to the rampant presence of
pornography.&quot;  The feelings expressed by this soldier are
shared by many others, and the end result is a decrease in morale,
unit integrity and overall readiness.

<p>

Some men want pornography to stimulate their sexual desires, but
this does not justify the government selling it to them at a discount
and tax-free.  That's why Rep. Roscoe Bartlett (R-M.D.) amended
the 1997 Defense Authorization Act to include language banning
future military sales of pornographic material.  This bill will
be debated in the House on May 15.

<p>

Government vending of pornography through the military exchange
system sends the message that profiting from material that demeans
women is okay.  This message is becoming increasingly unwelcome
to a growing cohort of female soldiers.  In fact, common sense
and science tell us that readily available pornographic material
encourages, rather than discourages, episodes like Tailhook, the
rape in Okinawa, and a sailor groping a female airline passenger.

<p>

It also hurts retention.  The Pentagon makes a big deal of family
issues because half of all military members are married.  For
many military spouses, who often are limited to shopping at government
exchanges, the sale of pornography is not only offensive, but
pornography consumption can be a contributing factor to the breakdown
of a marriage.  You can bet this impacts their husbands' retention
and, in effect, ratchets down military readiness yet another notch.

<p>

An Air Force wife complained that at her local exchange &quot;pornography
is viewed and then carelessly discarded on lower shelves, on top
of children's comic books, and I've seen one on an ice cream machine
at our base convenience store that children frequent after school.&quot;

<p>

The target of the bill is pornography, not romance novels or classic
art.  Pornography is Greek for &quot;depictions of the activities
of whores.&quot;  It is, by definition, sexually explicit and
intended primarily for the purpose of sexual arousal.  The Uniform
Code of Military Justice labels many of the activities described
and shown in this material as criminal if done by a servicemember.

<p>

There is a growing body of science which points to a direct association
between the consumption of pornography and sexual misconduct.
This should be a red flag for the military, which is experiencing
increased levels of sexual misbehavior.

<p>

The 1986 Attorney General's Commission on Pornography cites studies
which show that over half of rapists say they were &quot;incited
to commit an offense&quot; by pornography and that 42 percent
of child molesters &quot;implicated pornography&quot; in their
crimes.

<p>

A book by Don Gibbons, <I>Society, Crime, and Criminal Behavior</I>,
a copy of which is in the Pentagon library, cites a national study
that found that readership of sexually explicit magazines like
<I>Hustler</I> and <I>Playboy</I> (both of which are sold in military
stores) were highly correlated with rape rates.

<p>

Dr. Victor Cline, a clinical psychologist at the University of
Utah, chronicled the stages of addiction to pornography based
on his work with over 200 sex offenders.  He found that pornography
is a powerful stimulant that requires ever more explicit images
in order to reach the previous level of sexual arousal.  At some
point the addict may act out sexual fantasies inspired by the
material.

<p>

Pornographic material may also be a form of sexual harassment.
Sociologist Diana Russell states in her paper &quot;Pornography,
A Feminist Perspective&quot; that &quot;pornography is vicious,
anti-woman propaganda.  It tells lies about us.  It degrades women.
Pornography is not made to educate but to sell and, for the most
part, what sells it is a bunch of lies about sex and women.&quot;

<p>

Why does the Pentagon refuse to dump this material?  The contention
is that &quot;any attempt to prohibit the sale of magazines currently
available through the exchange services would raise serious constitutional
and administrative problems.&quot;  But the issue is not really
about constitutional rights, it is a matter of money.  Selling
smut in government stores is a big business decision.

<p>

The Pentagon sells 12.6 million copies of 219 different pornographic
magazines every year.  Its earnings are $4.3 million.  Customers
pay less than the market price and pay no tax.

<p>

Pornography is also the third highest profit industry in organized
crime -- after narcotics and gambling.  The FBI estimates the
pornography industry to be an $8-10 billion-a-year enterprise.

<p>

This is not a freedom of speech issue, because no one is advocating
denying soldiers the opportunity to buy legal pornography off
base and keep it in their barracks.

<p>

The Pentagon should not have constitutional concerns but moral
ones. Few federal judges would force the military to sell pornography,
those who would ought to become candidates for impeachment.

<p>

The constitutional obligation in this area belongs to Congress.
That obligation is to protect the military's combat fitness.
Under Article 1, Section 8, the Congress is duty bound to set
the rules and regulations for the military.  If Congress declares
that selling pornography is bad for readiness, then it has both
the right and obligation to rid exchange shelves of the smut.
The Supreme Court generally gives Congress special deference
in matters affecting the military.

<p>

Unfortunately, some base commanders, wishing to remove this material
from exchanges, have been told &quot;no&quot; by bureaucrats.
The threat of lawsuits has intimidated them.  There are some
exceptions, however.

<p>

The captain of the carrier <I>America</I> received a complaint
about a magazine sold in his ship's store.  The April 1984 issue
of <I>Hustler</I> magazine included graphic pictures of a woman
engaged in a sex act with a crucifix.  The ship's supply officer
was ordered to deep-six the magazine, and the order went unchallenged.

<p>

Marine commanders at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, ignored bureaucrats
when it came to a local purveyor of pornography.  Eugene's Arcade
was placed &quot;off limits&quot; to military personnel.  When
the shop owner filed a suit alleging violation of his rights of
free speech, federal judge W. Earl Britt dismissed it, concluding,
&quot;A military commander has an overriding duty to safeguard
the morals, welfare and discipline of his men.&quot;

<p>

President Clinton has unilateral authority to remove pornographic
material from military stores.  His executive order could prohibit
such sales all over the world, but there is no evidence the White
House is about to sign such an order.

<p>

That leaves the Congress with the responsibility to pass the Military
Honor and Decency Act.  It is the right thing to do.  It will
enhance readiness and reduce the cancer-like spread of pornography
that contributes to sexual misconduct.

<title>THE LEAST OF THESE</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>THE LEAST OF THESE</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Jennifer E. Marshall and Deanna Carlson</i></center>

<p>

Does increased social spending equate with better childhoods?
For lack of a better answer, both Republicans and Democrats have
been inclined to say &quot;yes.&quot;  Spending by the federal
government on social programs for children and families has increased
dramatically since 1960, far exceeding the rate of inflation.
Yet, almost all indicators suggest that more children today are
living just this side of despair than was true three decades ago.

<p>

Social spending advocates made their mistake in expecting government
to substitute for mothers and fathers.  Noted child psychologist
Urie Bronfenbrenner has written that what children need more than
government programs is the &quot;irrational emotional attachment&quot;
of parents who love them fiercely.  Even Bill Clinton stated in
his acceptance speech at the 1992 Democratic National Convention
that &quot;governments do not raise children -- parents do.&quot;

<p>

It's time to take the rhetoric seriously and to acknowledge that
government can't buy love for children any more than money can
buy happiness for adults.  What children really need is a mom
and a dad.

<p>

<center><h3><i>Parents, Not Programs</i></h3></center>

<p>

Rather than winking at government's creeping encroachment on families,
Congress should move quickly to pass pending parental rights legislation
(S. 984; H.R. 1946).  The legislation would neither create new
rights for parents nor repeal child abuse laws that protect children
when families break down.  The new law would simply protect parents'
rights to decide what is best for their children without excessive
interference from Washington.

<p>

Having affirmed the central importance of parents, government
does sometimes have a role to play in helping parents care for
the young ones in their charge.  One good example is &quot;Megan's
Law,&quot; which Congress has just passed and the President signed.
The new law requires states to notify local law officials when
convicted sex offenders are released from prison and requires
local police to notify the public when a sex offender who is deemed
dangerous moves into the local neighborhood.

<p>

<center><h3><i>Yes to Adoption</i></h3></center>

<p>

The community, of course, must step in to provide for children
who have no parents to call their own.  But the importance of
parents remains the same  -- and probably greater -- for children
who are alone.  The best government can do is to speed a child
on his way into a loving home where adoptive parents are prepared
to love him fiercely and forever.

<p>

&quot;The Adoption Promotion and Stability Act of 1996&quot;
(H.R. 3286), passed by the House but not yet the Senate, could
open windows of hope for vulnerable children currently free to
be adopted.  In the United States alone, there are more than 50,000
foster children hoping to be adopted.  More than 20,000 children
have been waiting for a family for a matter of years.  The new
legislation includes a $5,000 non-refundable tax credit for qualified
adoption expenses (for both domestic and international adoptions).
In order to eliminate unnecessary waiting periods for minority
children in foster care, the legislation also prohibits the use
of racial considerations if they cause a delay or denial of an
adoption placement.

<p>

<center><h3><i>No to Foster Care</i></h3></center>

<p>

New adoption incentives will help some children, but Conna Craig,
President of the Institute for Children, argues that nothing less
than an overhaul of the foster care system will save children
like John.  A skinny kid who loves baseball, John has been waiting
for a home for nearly all of his 10 years.  Legally free to be
adopted since he was 3 years old, John is a prisoner of the system
whose childhood is fast slipping away.  He needs policymakers
to understand that standing for children means giving every child
a chance to have a mom and a dad.

<p>

<center><h3><i>It Takes a &quot;Village&quot;</i></h3></center>

<p>

Even strong two-parent families require strong communities to
help pattern for children right habits of the heart.  When so
many children are languishing without families of their own, community
becomes all the more important.

<p>

&quot;The American Community Renewal Act of 1996,&quot; spearheaded
by Congressmen James Talent (R-Mo.) and J.C. Watts (R-Okla.),
will strengthen communities more than any government handout could
by offering tax incentives for charitable giving, public housing
reform, and an end to government regulations that stifle economic
development in depressed neighborhoods.  By rebuilding communities,
we stand to strengthen the hands of parents -- and to restore
some of childhood's lost innocence.

<p>

It's right and fair to admit that it takes a village, as long
as we really mean a local &quot;village&quot; that preserves parent
autonomy, instead of a federal plantation that chains both children
and families to an all-powerful state.

<h2>THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>Melissa Wells-Petry</i></center>

<p>

So much for democracy.  In its most recent foray into the culture
war, the Supreme Court held that it really could not think of
any good reason why the people of Colorado (or any other state,
for that matter) might think it wise to put the brakes on the
radical homosexual agenda by adopting Amendment 2, a law that
precludes special legal status for homosexuality.

<p>

Since the Supremes personally could not think of any good reason
for the law, they held there could be no good reason.  In fact,
they went further and charged that anyone who disagrees with them
is a bigot, a kook, and certainly a person who ought to be ashamed
of himself for even thinking of using the lowly democratic process
to express a view unacceptable to the ruling elite.  How dare
we, the people.

<p>

Not to put too fine a point on it, but are we sick of this already?
By that I mean that sick, helpless feeling in your stomach when
you know something right has been deemed, by the self-anointed,
&quot;wrong.&quot;  That ominous sickness that grips the heart
when it seems no matter how hard we try to take steps to address
the glaring problems in our society --whether it is to oppose
homosexuality, the transmogrification of marriage, the right to
infanticide (which surely the partial-birth abortion is) -- there,
like the Angel of Death, await the Elite who, with the stroke
of a pen, not only veto the result of our reasoning together through
the legislative process, but who also dash our aspirations for
building up, not tearing down, mores that are the essential supports
for civilization.  <I>We must fight back</I>.

<p>

As Americans, we have a deep respect for the rule of law.  But
for too long in this country, long after there ceased to exist
any evidence for doing so, we have equated the rule of law with
the rulings of the Supreme Court.  That equation is both incorrect
and dangerous.

<p>

If the Supreme Court succeeds in taking away our democracy, it
will be only because we let it.  The Court's recent opinion in
<I>Romer v. Evans</I>, which struck down Colorado's constitutional 
amendment on homosexuality, like <I>Roe v. Wade</I>, like countless 
other decisions that were nothing less than a raw power grab dressed 
up in fancy legal mumbo-jumbo, should be a call to arms in the culture 
war.

<p>

Instead of wailing about the excesses of these mere mortals in
robes, instead of being cowed by potential litigation, instead
of being silenced by the possibility that the justices might think
they know better than the people, for example, on what constitutes
a rationale response to the homosexual agenda, instead of saying
&quot;well, the Supreme Court says abortion is 'A-OK' and we can't
do anything about it,&quot; it's time to remind ourselves the
Constitution gives the people the real power, too, and the people
need to use it.

<p>

So the Supreme Court has called the 813,966 citizens who supported
Amendment 2 bigots.  So the Supreme Court has struck down the
law because it sees no danger in the State giving its imprimatur
to homosexuality and it won't credit those who do.  For those
who believe this nation must take steps to shore up its moral
foundation if it is to survive, and who conclude that special
legal status for homosexuality is inconsistent with that moral
foundation, the response must be to pass another law.  And another
law and another.  Pass one every week.  Change the language, take
a new approach, come at the problem from a different angle, don't
give up.  If the Supreme Court strikes it down, say &quot;Fine.
It is on your head.&quot;  Then dust yourself off and pass another
law.

<p>

Those who understand, in the words of Justice Scalia, that it
is &quot;eminently reasonable to use the legislative process to
address the various battles in the culture war may never get the
Court to admit the arrogance of its ways. (If <I>Roe</I> is any
object lesson, once the Court digs a whole, that hole only gets
deeper and more labyrinthine each time the justices heft the shovel.)

<p>

Nevertheless, if those who appreciate the legislative power the
Constitution gives to ordinary folks keep at it, one way or another,
eventually they will make their point.  At the end of the day,
they will be standing.  They will have exercised their prerogatives,
the prerogatives of democracy.  Never mind the elites.  The process
itself is a valuable vehicle through which to engage the soul
of the nation and through which to reason together (no matter
how contentiously) on the direction we, as a people, should go.

<p>

It's not pleasant to be labeled a bigot by the court -- especially
this nation's highest court -- simply because it is looking for a 
legal justification in all the wrong places. Be that as it may, the 
plain truth remains. The justices can rule all day that the people don't 
have the power to express their moral consensus at the ballot box on any
number of issues, but they can't diminish democracy unless we
let them.  Dish it up and send it back.  That's the response befitting
a government of, by, and for the people.

<title>JUDICIAL TERRORISM: A MORAL CRISIS</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">

<p>

<h2>JUDICIAL TERRORISM:<br>
A MORAL CRISIS</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis and Robert H. Knight</i></center>

<p>

Coloradans voted 54 to 46 percent in 1992 to approve a statewide
referendum that barred the state and local governments from enacting
laws that gave &quot;special rights&quot; to homosexuals.  In
a sweeping and unprecedented move, the Supreme Court on May 20,
1996, declared Colorado's &quot;special rights&quot; prohibition
unconstitutional.

<p>

The Supreme Court's decision striking down Colorado's law may
prove to be the cultural equivalent of <I>Roe v. Wade</I>.  That
1973 decision has resulted in the deaths of 30 million unborn
Americans.  This decision may result in the death of the traditional
family and the institution of marriage -- the very core of our
society.

<p>

Writing for the minority, Justice Antonin Scalia said there is
&quot;no foundation in American constitutional law&quot; for the
court's ruling.

<p>

Using strange (but politically correct) reasoning, the high court
equates limiting special treatment for homosexuals with denying
them equal protection under the constitution.  The fact is, no
one proposes to deny homosexuals their constitutional rights.
Colorado citizens merely chose to deny the establishment of another
class of citizens with more rights than other citizens.  Such
legal status has been reserved for the truly disadvantaged.  As
a group, however, homosexuals are renowned for being politically,
financially and otherwise advantaged.

<p>

Denying preferential treatment to a group whose identifying marker
may be criminal behavior can hardly be construed as violating
an individual's civil rights.  To do so would be a serious blow
to democracy.  To say that disallowing special treatment is the
same as denying equal protection is ludicrous.  Any group that
loses a political battle at the state level could be said to have
&quot;lost&quot; equal protection.

<p>

The court's decision opens the flood gates to potential litigation.
Any law based on the majority's moral beliefs is subject to being
labeled as &quot;hate-based&quot; or &quot;bigoted,&quot; and
groups affected by such laws are likely to seek legal redress.

<p>

Five states have constitutional prohibitions against polygamy.
With the new decision, people with a polygamous &quot;orientation&quot;
may logically complain that they have been singled out for unequal
treatment.  This same line of reasoning could be used by groups
identified by criminal behavior such as pedophilia.

<p>

Scalia wrote, &quot;The Court's disposition today suggests that
these provisions [polygamy prohibitions] are unconstitutional...unless,
of course, polygamists for some reason have fewer constitutional
rights than homosexuals.&quot;

<p>

The court's majority opinion also insults Coloradans by suggesting
that they are hateful. That's absurd. The will of the people
was to defend traditional sexual mores against a politically powerful
minority.  The homosexual rights agenda seeks to force Americans
to embrace their morality by using the law to declare homosexuality
the moral equivalent of heterosexuality.

<p>

Colorado, where sodomy is no longer illegal, made no attempt to
restrict homosexual conduct which is still illegal in 20 states
and in the U.S. armed forces.  Although many states have removed
criminal statutes for sodomy (the defining homosexual behavior)
the act is still widely held as being morally wrong and socially
harmful.

<p>

The court's majority opinion ignored the 1986 <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I>
decision in which Georgia's sodomy law was declared constitutional.
If laws against sodomy are constitutional, then why must preferential
treatment be accorded to those whose defining characteristic is
their self-identification with the practice of sodomy?

<p>

After all, there is no reliable evidence that homosexuality is
genetic.  It is a behavior tragically afflicting less than two
percent of the population.  It is recognized by most psychiatric
associations around the world as pathological or as a sexual deviation.
According to a 1993 <I>Psychiatric News</I> report, only three
psychiatric associations out of 125 in the world -- including
the United States -- have declared homosexuality normal.

<p>

The <I>Romer v. Evans</I> decision is a severe blow to America's
moral heritage and will be used by homosexual rights activists
to further separate the family from its traditional Judeo-Christian
roots.  They will use this ruling to force religiously motivated
people to subsidize and promote behavior that they find morally
bankrupt and against their most deeply held beliefs.

<p>

The next target of the gay rights activists is the Defense of
Marriage Act (DOMA), which is now before Congress.  Given the
<I>Romer</I> decision, the high court may label DOMA as 
&quot;hate-mongering&quot; and rule it unconstitutional as well.
Think about that -- marriage itself constituting &quot;bigotry&quot;
because it requires both sexes.

<p>

It's time for Congress to assert its rightful place in the running
of our nation.  DOMA would send a strong message that Americans
will not knuckle under to judicial terrorism.  Its swift passage
is now more imperative than ever.

<title>THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT: WHAT THE EXPERTS HAVE TO SAY</title>

<p>

<h2>THE DEFENSE OF<br>
MARRIAGE ACT:<br>
WHAT THE EXPERTS<br>
HAVE TO SAY</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Gary L. Bauer</i></center>

<p>

Amid the clamor over action in the House and Senate on the Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA), the Family Research Council held a briefing
recently for Capitol Hill staff.

<p>

A national C-SPAN audience heard from a psychiatrist, a legal
scholar, a social worker, a former school principal, an adoption
specialist and a former homosexual, among others.  Their highlighted
statements shed light on homosexuality and the need for DOMA.

<p>

<I>Jeffrey Satinover, M.D., former Fellow in Psychiatry and Child
Psychiatry at Yale</I>: &quot;Two profoundly mistaken ideas have
sunk deeply into public sentiment where they exert a powerful
influence in the shaping of public policy as it relates to family,
sexuality and marriage.  1) Homosexuality is genetic, and that
consequently, 2) Homosexuality is unchangeable.

<p>

&quot;Neither idea is true, and in fact there is a mountain of
scientific evidence to the contrary.  The Americans most severely
harmed by the propagation of these untruths are the very large
number of homosexuals who wish nothing more than to rid themselves
of these unwanted impulses and establish quiet marriages and families.
The gay and lesbian activism that claims to speak for these many
struggling fellow citizens speaks for their interests in no way
whatsoever.  Completely ignored are the very large number of people
who have already succeeded in leaving homosexuality behind.&quot;

<p>

<I>Hadley Arkes, Professor of Jurisprudence and American Institutions
at Amherst</I>:  &quot;Every argument for gay marriage is an argument
that would support polygamy.  The gay activists may not have the
remotest interest in promoting polygamy, but ... they have the
most profound interest...in discrediting the notion that marriage
finds its defining ground in 'nature.'
We can count on the fact that there will be someone, somewhere,
ready to press this issue by raising a challenge in the court....This
[Defense of Marriage] Act is the most delicate and limited measure
that the Congress could produce [and] it makes the least intrusion
into the domain of State law.&quot;

<p>

<I>Anthony Falzarano, executive director of Transformation Ministries</I>:
&quot;I speak to you today not just as an observer of this movement,
but as one of them.  I am a former homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle
from the time I was 17 until I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle
thinking that there really wasn't any choice for me.  What I didn't
realize is that although I didn't choose to be homosexual, I did
not have to be gay.  I had a choice.  I could change my orientation....four
national ex-gay networks are currently ministering to more than
10,000 former homosexuals.  Many of us are sick and tired of a
lifestyle that initially seems very freeing but eventually puts
us in all kinds of bondage and eventually will kill us.  I have
lost over 35 of my friends and acquaintances to the disease of
AIDS and don't want to see one more person become infected....&quot;

<p>

<I>Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies at Family Research
Council</I>: &quot;Most Americans believe in 'live and let live.'
But tolerance is not what homosexual activists  seek.  They are
demanding that society elevate homosexuality to the moral level
of marriage.  When they bring the law into it, they are imposing
it on every citizen.  If you are a devout Christian, Jew or Muslim,
or just believe that homosexuality is wrong, and the law gives
homosexuality protected status, then your personal beliefs are
now outside civil law.  The entire civil rights apparatus can
be brought against you.  Businessmen will have to subsidize homosexuality
or face legal sanction; schoolchildren will have to be taught
that homosexuality is equivalent to marital love.&quot;

<p>

<I>Linda Page, former school principal and education consultant</I>:
&quot;Our kids will be bombarded with the propaganda from books
such as <I>Heather Has Two Mommies</I>....Same-sex
'marriage' is a result of a destructive, narcissistic way of thinking
and of 'value-neutral' curriculums....We have communicated to
students that all values are equal.  How ludicrous....&quot;

<p>

<I>Peter LaBarbera, publisher of</I> The Lambda Report 
on Homosexuality: &quot;Activists have shamelessly
exploited the issue of 'gay youth' suicide to promote pro-homosexuality
programs in schools....they routinely claim that homosexual youth
make up one third of all youth suicides.  This wildly exaggerated
figure has its origins in a paper by a San Francisco gay activist
which was repudiated by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan.&quot;

<p>

<I>Brenda Destro, Adjunct Professor on
Marriage and Family at the John Paul II Institute and former consultant
for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of
Adolescent Pregnancy</I>: &quot;Many...(junior
and high school) teens and preteens...have one close girlfriend
and boys have one close boyfriend.  This is an important phase
in learning emotional intimacy that is crucial to forming healthy
relationships....So what happens to the preteens and teens who
receive information about homosexuality and same-sex 'marriages'
at the same time that they are bonding with their friends (around
the ages of 11-14)...?  Confusion can turn to a fear that they
may be homosexual, when they are not.&quot;

<p>

<I>Mary Beth Style, M.S.W., adoption expert</I>: 
&quot;Obviously, if the states begin to recognize marriage between
homosexuals, it will likely become easier for two homosexuals
to adopt a child because they will be meeting the marriage requirement....
There is no 'right' to adopt, and to create one would be contrary
to the best interests of children, because instead of finding
the most appropriate family for a child, the state and its agents
would have to ensure that adults are allowed to adopt a child.
Since a 'right' is a guarantee, the state would be required to
'guarantee' a child for adoption.&quot;

<p>

The above testimonies show the logical
fallacies of misnaming same-sex unions as &quot;marriage&quot;
and the devastating implications for society.  Our concern for
families, children, and the natural and sacred ties that secure
our culture underscore the need for the Defense of Marriage Act.

<title>FAITH-BASED PROGRAMS CAN HELP FISCALLY-STRAPPED GOVERNMENTS</title>

<h2>FAITH-BASED PROGRAMS CAN<br>
HELP FISCALLY-STRAPPED<br>
GOVERNMENTS</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

Texas is blazing the trail for the nation by investigating the
strange marriage between fiscally-strapped government and faith-based
social service programs.  This relationship has the potential
to solve many social and fiscal problems.

<p>

Texas' effort recognizes that the church can succeed where government
can't. Consider the case of Edward Woods from Marshall, Texas,
who had a 12-year drug addiction, was twice imprisoned and had
tried to commit suicide.  Today, he's a totally different person,
and he gives credit to his new faith in Jesus Christ.  If Woods
has really gone straight, Texas will save the social costs normally
associated with long-term chronic crime, drug abuse and repeat
incarceration.  Changing Woods' life cost the taxpayer nothing.
A faith-based organization picked up the tab.

<p>

On May 2, 1996, Texas Governor George Bush set up a task force
to examine how to encourage faith-based programs while avoiding
groups like David Koresh's Waco-based Branch Davidians.  The state's
hidden agenda is saving taxpayer funds by encouraging the faith
community to meet more needs.  The task force reports back this
September.

<p>

Social costs are outdistancing government's reach.  Nationally,
crime costs a half-trillion dollars annually and drug abuse treatment
costs the federal government many billions while reaching only
a fraction of those in need.  Although there are growing numbers
of homeless and hungry, as misery rises government outlays fall.
The faith community, which has a God-given responsibility to
help, must step in, and government should open the door for their
participation.

<p>

America has a tradition of relying on the church.  It was the
church that built most of the nation's hospitals.  The church
was the prominent player in the civil rights movement.  The church
was the original safety net for the homeless, the hungry and the
orphaned.

<p>

On July 16, faith-based groups told the Austin-based task force
that state regulations make helping people in crisis difficult.
The Texas Commission of Alcohol and Drug Abuse tried to shut
down faith-based Victory Fellowship, which is a rehabilitation
program run by former addicts.  Fellowship founder Freddie Garcia
said, &quot;We don't use drugs or psychiatrists or any of that,
only Bible study.&quot;  While government programs have a cure
rate of 10 percent at a cost of hundreds of dollars per day per
client, Garcia's program has a 70 percent success rate.

<p>

Some faith-based groups in Texas are wary of government regulators.
Natalie Musgrave Ingram with San Antonio's Christian Assistance
Ministry said her board is worried about state control.  CAM is
a 10-church cooperative ministry that last year fed, clothed,
educated and counseled 35,000 people.  The group takes no government
money. Sylvestor Matthews, a 30-year Texas pastor, warned the
task force that government funding of faith-based programs could
lead to the licensing of churches.

<p>

Task force member Cecil Hawkins, executive director for African
American Men of Peace Development, Dallas, Texas, said that a
state license only ensures control, not quality.  He said, &quot;I've
been licensed by God.  I don't want to be held accountable to
the state for my ministry.&quot;  Another member reminded the
task force that Jim Jones who led his followers to mass suicide
in Jonestown, Guyana had five state-approved licenses.

<p>

The faith-based community wants to do something about the prison
problem.  Texas businessman Fred Billings told the Texas task
force that the only hope for the criminal is to change him from
inside, not to build more jails.  Billings said the state has
been throwing money at a problem that is getting too large and
complex.  He supports the creation of a prison program based on
a faith-based approach.

<p>

His prison idea is modeled on a successful 20-year program in
Brazil where inmate recidivism is very low.  The program is designed
to create a correctional environment within the existing criminal
justice system that restores individual inmates to responsible
and productive relationships with their communities, families,
and Creator.

<p>

There is evidence that religion makes a difference for prisoners
and recidivism.  Chuck Colson's Prison Fellowship, in cooperation
with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, found in a study that religious
former inmates had a significantly lower recidivism rate than
non-religious former inmates.  Todd Clear writes for the National
Council on Crime and Delinquency that true religion helps inmates
deal with personal problems, leads to dealing with guilt and helps
them accept personal responsibility for crimes.  Religious inmates
are also more likely to become model prisoners than non-religious
inmates.

<p>

This nation faces serious moral problems.  The faith community
is equipped to address these problems if government will tame
the bureaucrats.  The marriage of necessity between government
and the faith community, which has existed since George Washington's
time, must be rekindled.  Our founders were men of faith who knew
that the great answers of life come from the church, not from
the legislature or the White House.

<p>

The final task force speaker brought a word of encouragement.
Texan Beth Hill said, &quot;The God I serve is bigger than any
bureaucracy.  What God calls us to, he will equip us 
to do.&quot;  Let's hope that Beth's words ring loudly across
this land, that churches respond to this call to service, and
that government recognizes its place and gets out of the way.

<title>GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT ENCOURAGE NEWEST HEROIN EPIDEMIC</title>

<h2>GOVERNMENT SHOULD<br>
NOT ENCOURAGE<br>
NEWEST HEROIN EPIDEMIC</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

We are about to repeat an epidemic among young people, according
to Ginna Marston, research director for the Partnership for a
Drug-Free America.  &quot;It's stupid, because an earlier generation
has already been through this,&quot; Marston said.

<p>

The Partnership has launched an advertising campaign to counteract
&quot;heroin chic&quot; in the pop culture.  Meanwhile, in July,
a White House panel of scientists and activists who serve as advisors
on AIDS policy labeled the administration &quot;timid&quot; for
failing to support drug-abuser needle-exchange programs. Of the
panel members, almost half have the AIDS virus and an equal number
are homosexual.

<p>

This panel, well-intentioned but misguided, is part of an organized
effort to secure government funding for clean needle giveaways
to drug addicts in an attempt to slow the spread of the AIDS virus.
The evidence that such giveaways work, however, is far from conclusive.

<p>

A 1993 law permits the government to use federal funds to support
exchanges only if they can be scientifically shown to slow the
spread of the AIDS virus without increasing drug abuse.  To date,
studies are plagued with problems.  They rely on self-reporting
by addicts, downplay sexual transmission of the AIDS virus, generally
ignore the impact on communities near exchange sites, trivialize
the drug problem and never measure HIV seroconversion rates, the
only true indication of effectiveness.

<p>

Two of the three medical doctors on a much-cited government needle
study say that needle exchanges &quot;are not the panacea their
supporters hope for.&quot;  Now is not the time for government to 
tacitly endorse drug abuse by giving needles to addicts.

<p>

Worldwide heroin production has nearly doubled since the late
1980s. Since 1988, emergency room &quot;episodes&quot; in the
U.S. resulting from heroin overdoses have increased
68 percent.  Street heroin purity is up from a low of 4 percent
a decade ago to nearly 70 percent today.  Meanwhile, competition
between Colombian cartels and Asian syndicates has driven the
street price for a glassine envelope of smack as low as five dollars.

<p>

Heroin's growing popularity stems from its low price and high
purity and the fact that needle-shy users can now get high from
snorting or smoking the substance.  A Yale University student
explains, &quot;Most people here are snorting dope. There's a
very safe-sex-style, safe-drug-use aesthetic.&quot;

<p>

Heroin is the drug of choice among many of today's rock stars.
In spite of the well-publicized July 12, 1996 heroin death of
rocker Jonathan Melvoin, a keyboard player for the Smashing Pumpkins,
abuse grows.  &quot;Heroin is hot,&quot; says Detective Frank
Lyga, with the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollywood narcotics
division.  The August 9 edition of <I>Entertainment Weekly</I>
says that &quot;heroin has become the cocaine of the '90s&quot;
and a recent article in <I>Rolling Stone</I> profiled heroin's
resurgence in colleges.

<p>

&quot;Heroin's huge because it's the most extreme thing,&quot;
says Danny Boyle, director of &quot;Trainspotting,&quot; a controversial
new movie about Scottish heroin abusers.  The movie portrays heroin
abuse as exciting and may seduce some into drug experimentation.

<p>

In the face of rising heroin abuse, drug czar General Barry McCaffrey
is unwilling to support pro-needle advocates and wants to fight
illegal drug abuse.  &quot;The problem is not dirty needles,&quot;
says McCaffrey, &quot;the problem is heroin addiction.&quot;
Others agree.

<p>

&quot;Our goal should be to eliminate drug abuse,&quot; says Rep.
Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), &quot;not to find a cleaner, safer way
to do it.&quot;  Dr. James Curtis, director of the Department
of Psychiatry, Harlem Hospital Center, says exchanges are &quot;poor
medicine&quot; and &quot;promote a breakdown in law and order.&quot;

<p>

Philip Lee, assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services and
a former needle exchange researcher, suggests exchanges &quot;may
send a mixed message about drug use.&quot;  Eighty-six exchanges
now operate in 55 U.S. cities without federal funds.  They provide
free drug-injecting supplies, condoms, advice on shooting drugs
properly, warnings about bad heroin, and counseling that sometimes
leads to treatment.

<p>

Although the science is inconclusive, expect AIDS activists and
pro-drug legalization forces (who never shy away from using incomplete
or erroneous data to support their agenda) to pressure the government
to approve funds for needle giveaways.  To endorse
one evil in an attempt to prevent another is at best a no-win
situation.  Clearly, this could become another example of an expensive
government program working at cross purposes to sound public policy.

<title>CYBERCHAOS: NOT FIRST AMENDMENT'S PROMISE</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>CYBERCHAOS:<br>
NOT FIRST AMENDMENT'S<br>
PROMISE</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Cathleen A. Cleaver, Esq.</i></center>

<p>

The Department of Justice has announced that it will appeal to
the Supreme Court the recent Philadelphia federal court's ruling
against the Communications Decency Act.  That appeal is the right
thing to do, and here's why.

<p>

Not long ago I debated Bob Guccioni, publisher of <I>Penthouse</I>,
on the merits of restricting computer pornography and the Philadelphia
ruling.  Not surprisingly, he was elated by the three-judge panel's
decision to strike the indecency provisions, the effect of which
was to give a computer pornographer more &quot;free speech&quot;
rights than any other speaker in any other forum.  For the first
time in the history of our country, a porn purveyor may intentionally
show sexually explicit pictures to a child without legal jeopardy
-- provided the purveyor uses the Internet.  First in line to
challenge the CDA was, of course, the ACLU and its cyberclones,
followed by CompuServe, America Online, and others with a huge
financial stake in the unenforceability of the CDA, like <I>Playboy</I> 
and <I>Penthouse</I>.  Guccioni may finally claim the consumer
market share which he has heretofore been denied.

<p>

Not only did the Philadelphia panel strike provisions prohibiting
adults from posting sexually explicit materials in public areas
of the Internet that children frequent -- like teen chat rooms
-- but it also struck the prohibition on e-mailing a <I>Penthouse</I>
centerfold (or the like) directly to a specific child who is known
by the sender to be a child.  In the words of the Department of
Justice:  &quot;Never before in the history of telecommunications
media in the United States has so much indecent (and obscene)
material been so easily accessible by so many minors in so many
American homes with so few restrictions.&quot;

<p>

To say the ruling is flawed is a double understatement.  Not only
is the decision based on legal theories directly contrary to Supreme
Court precedent and incorrect assumptions about the capabilities
of Internet technology, but it is less a ruling than a trio of
separate opinions.  Each judge took his turn chiding Congress
for daring to inhibit the liberty of cyberspace pioneers, however
ruthless, in the interest of children and the greater cybercommunity.
Highlights from the lengthy trilogy include conclusions that
it is &quot;either technologically impossible or economically
prohibitive&quot; to comply with the CDA, that the term 'indecent'
is altogether too vague, and that, &quot;just as the strength
of the Internet is chaos, so the strength of our liberty depends
upon the chaos and cacophony of unfettered speech.&quot;  These
conclusions defy fact, law, and logic, respectively.

<p>

Given that some on-line pornographers currently screen and restrict
children from their sites, it cannot be said that compliance is
impossible.  Moreover, new technology is being developed at dizzying
speed to address a variety of Internet challenges, such as consumer
transaction security and the protection of property rights of
amateur musicians who exchange their songs, making it all the
more evident that it is really lack of will and not ability which
makes Internet advocates cry &quot;foul.&quot;  As to expense,
this callous court complains about the economic burden the CDA
would impose on distributors of pornography, while finding it
good and proper for parents alone to incur the costs, however
great, of protecting their children.  Outside the sacred realm
of cyberspace, distributors of pornography routinely incur expenses
to shield children.  To cite just one example, &quot;blinder racks&quot;
must be purchased and installed at newsstands so that children
do not see offensive sex magazine covers.  This economic burden
flows directly from the legal responsibility these distributors
bear to shield this material from minors.  Software blocking programs,
on the other hand, are initially expensive for parents, need frequent
updating (at considerable expense), are easily circumvented by
computer-savvy kids, and are simply incapable of screening much
of the pornography.  Surfwatch, the leading software blocker,
admitted in the CDA hearing to missing up to 800 sexually explicit
sites each month!

<p>

Moreover, it goes without saying that a software blocking program
can only work on a family's home computer where it is installed.
What happens when the kids go next door or, for that matter,
to the public library?  The American Library Association proclaimed
in the Philadelphia court that, as a matter of solemn principle,
it will never employ software screening programs in its libraries'
computers -- not even when children use them.  This to-hell-with-children
sentiment is reflected by the judges and echoes throughout their
opinions.

<p>

Chief Judge Sloviter's opinion even concludes that for &quot;<I>content
providers</I> . . . <I>to review all of their material</I>&quot;
to determine which of it is sexually explicit is surely &quot;a
burden one should not have to bear.&quot;  <I>What</I>?  The content
provider is in the <I>best</I> position to determine whether his
material contains patently offensive depictions of sexual or excretory
activities, and that is why our laws have <I>always</I> required
him to do just that.  The allocation of this burden to the speaker,
as opposed to the consumer of the speech, not only carries the
weight of unanimous legal precedent, but also has the benefit
of being practical.  It is virtually a truism to say that, as
between speaker and consumer, the speaker is in the better position
to know the content of his speech.  Judge Sloviter would remove
a reasonable burden from content providers and replace it with
the enormous and nearly impossible burden on parents to first
locate, then evaluate, and then block pornographic material in
an effort to protect their children.

<p>

Their quarrel with the indecency standard reveals that the judges
are either ill-informed or ill-intentioned.  An indecent communication
is one &quot;that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms
patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards,
sexual or excretory activities or organs.&quot;  This definition
has been consistently upheld in every case in which it has been
reviewed, including at the Supreme Court, which, most recently
in the cable pornography  case of <I>Denver Area Educational Telecommunications
Consortium, Inc. v. FCC</I>, held the standard to be &quot;not
impermissibly vague.&quot;  As if to justify their awkward conclusion,
the court lists as examples of &quot;threatened&quot; speech material
which simply could not fall within the definition of indecency,
such as discussions of recent movies or ancient Indian statues
or articles about human rights violations.  To serve their end,
the judges conveniently, but not subtly, ignore the requirement
that the materials be evaluated &quot;in context.&quot;  No court
has ever construed this standard to encompass, without any consideration
of context, all material of literary or artistic value that is
somehow related to sexuality.

<p>

Not to be topped, Judge Dalzell proclaims:  &quot;<I>Any</I> content-based
regulation of the Internet, no matter how benign the purpose,
could burn the global village to roast the pig.&quot;  Really?
What about fraud -- may we not protect consumers in cyberspace?
May we not ban child pornography or enforce copyright violations
on-line?  Would these content-based regulations burn the village,
too?

<p>

If the First Amendment's promise to this new technology is indeed
chaos and anarchy, then perhaps Judge Dalzell is right.  But before
we too quickly agree with this visionary from the federal bench,
we ought to ask ourselves how we have survived and thrived as
a democracy for two centuries upon the bedrock of ordered liberty,
the enemy of chaos and anarchy.

<p>

The Supreme Court ought to roundly denounce this federal panel's
decision.  To affirm it would be to rob our children of the opportunity
to participate in this great new communications medium, or worse,
to sacrifice them to perversions and excesses for the convenience
and pleasure of the worst malefactors on-line -- in effect, to
preserve the pornographers' new found sanctuary known as cyberspace.

<title>A HIGHER PRO-LIFE TEST</title>

<p>

<h2>A HIGHER PRO-LIFE TEST</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Gary L. Bauer</i></center>

<p>

Marvin Olasky's &quot;stricter&quot; pro-life litmus test (<I>World</I>, 
November 11, 1995) moved me to respond.  Few Christians have
done more to advance the pro-life cause than Dr. Olasky.  I honor
his spiritual commitment, his deep scholarship and his passion
for unborn children.  I am grateful, especially, for Marvin and
Susan's cross-racial adoption of a young son.  As the son of an
adopted father, I thank the Lord for their good hearts.

<p>

Still, I must dissent, because I do not believe that my friend's
formulation advances the effort to protect innocent, unborn children.
While I fully agree that we should ask those who would govern
us to go <I>beyond</I> mere formal and legalistic support for
a Human Life Amendment, we must insist that they go <I>at least
that far.</I> We have heard similar arguments by pro-life leaders
that we might be better off with a &quot;culturally conservative&quot;
president, one who speaks out for abstinence and for personal
responsibility than with a leader who gives mere &quot;lip service&quot;
to the <I>chimera</I> of a Human Life Amendment.

<p>

This, regrettably, is the logical fallacy of the false dilemma.
We have never sought insincere pro-life leadership.  We fully
understand that only those who are themselves convinced are likely
to be convincing to others.  But if we abandon a <I>higher test</I>
for pro-life support, we risk losing everything we have sought
in public policy.

<p>

What is that higher test?  It can be stated simply.  Lincoln said
that God gave man a hand and a mouth.  &quot;And his hand has
a right to bring bread to his mouth without controversy.&quot;
This simple and eloquent statement provided the philosophical
foundation for the Emancipator's opposition to slavery.  Examined
closely, it also provides the platform for Christian opposition
to abortion.

<p>

God forms the child in the womb.  He forms her lungs and her lips.
Her lungs have a right to draw past her lips the air He has so
graciously provided <I>without controversy.</I> Lincoln knew
that &quot;if slavery was not wrong, then nothing is wrong.&quot;
We know that if abortion is not wrong, then nothing is wrong.

<p>

This nation cannot survive as a political community if we turn
our back on this fundamental principle of right and wrong.  Some
<I>in society</I> will carry the burden of all private means to
provide alternatives to abortion.  They deserve the honor and
gratitude of the Ages. They tend the moral lights around us.
They shield the flame of conscience.

<p>

But what we need from those <I>in public office</I> is an understanding
of why government exists. Jefferson said that &quot;the care
of  human life and happiness <I>and not their destruction</I>
is the first and only legitimate object of good government [emphasis
added].&quot;  It was this understanding that infused our Declaration
of Independence. It was this understanding that Lincoln expressed
so convincingly in his Gettysburg Address. Lose that understanding
and we lose America.

<p>

What is at stake is not just the millions of human lives that
will be sacrificed if we abandon our commitment to the constitutional
protection of innocent human life. These lives are precious and
irreplaceable.  We pro-lifers must stand as well for the continued
life of this land we love.  Pope John Paul II put Lincoln's immortal
words at Gettysburg in the form of a question: &quot;Can any
nation so conceived and so dedicated long endure?&quot;  America
cannot survive the death of her spirit.

<p>

Surely, we need to create a pro-life culture.  Just as surely,
it is cruel and unjust <I>court rulings</I> which prevent Americans
from expressing those pro-life convictions they already hold.
How else can we explain the deplorable action of the Supreme
Court in striking down the abortion laws of 50 states?  How else
can we explain inferior courts' contemptuous sweeping away of
a host of protective laws passed since the <I>Webster</I> decision
of 1989?  It is these <I>political bodies</I> which are strangling
pro-life culture in a back alley.

<p>

Dr. King certainly shared the goal of a just society in which
no one would be judged by the color or his skin, but by &quot;the
content of his character.&quot;  Yet, that cultural goal never
diverted him from supporting timely political action against lynching.
&quot;I know a law cannot make a white racist love me,&quot;
he said, &quot;but the chances are much better that he will <I>learn</I> 
to love me if he hasn't lynched me first!&quot;

<p>

Imagine you are seated next to the president of the United States
and that the two of you are forced to witness a partial-birth
abortion.  Imagine further that he is the only one in the world
with power to stop the abortionist from jamming his scissors into
the base of the little girl's skull.  Do you want a &quot;culturally
conservative&quot; but &quot;pro-choice&quot; president to be
in that room with you?  Or do you want a president who believes
that it is morally and constitutionally wrong to take that little
girl's life?

<p>

So let's petition all those who would have power over us.  Let's
remind them of their duty to defend innocent human life.  We must
call them to a higher test -- support for a Human Life Amendment. Let's 
honor all those who are giving practical and loving support to women 
who choose life.  But let's give power only to those who understand that 
they have no authority unless it comes from above.

<title>The Strange Transformation of the Supreme Court's Privacy Doctrine</title>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2><i>MEYER</i>, HOW YOU'VE GROWN:<br>
THE STRANGE TRANSFORMATION<br>
OF THE SUPREME COURT'S<br>
PRIVACY DOCTRINE</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>David M. Wagner</i></center>
<p>
<i>This paper is the text of a lecture given at Molloy College, Rockville Center, 
NY, on April 21, 1994.</i>
<p>
The &quot;constitutional right of privacy&quot;
was much talked about back in 1987, when Robert Bork -- a nominee
who had been considered unbeatable because of his sterling legal
record -- was, in fact, beaten, largely because his opponents
focused on the fact that he had critiqued the Court's privacy
cases.  Judge Bork's defeat should have meant, at a minimum, that
privacy, whatever exactly it is, is highly valued by the American
people.
<p>
Supporters of Judge Bork countered that the word &quot;privacy&quot;
was merely that year's euphemism for abortion.  They were right,
insofar as the cases that Judge Bork had gotten in the most trouble
for critiquing were <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i>,[1] in which the Court
struck down a statute that banned the use of contraceptives, and
<i>Roe v. Wade</i>,[2] which, of course, is the foundational case for a
constitutional right of abortion.
<p>
But the constitutional right
of privacy did not start with these cases.  It started in a very
different kind of cultural environment and was deployed in defense
of very different values.  The story of its origins and subsequent
development tells us a lot about the changes in the thinking of
our nation's elites between the early 1920's and today.
<p>
The privacy cases trace their origin to a series of Supreme Court cases in
the 1920's that all dealt, in one way or another, with the rights
of parents to direct the education of their children.  Included
in this series were <i>Meyer v. Nebraska</i>[3] and <i>Bartels v. Iowa</i>,[4] 
in which the Court struck down statutes that banned the teaching
of foreign languages below the ninth grade.
<p>
(You might wonder how such statutes got passed in the first place.  Remember that
this was in the early 20's, and passions were still high from
World War I.  Notice that the names of the
plaintiffs, Meyer and Bartels, were both German.)
<p>
In the later cases of the series, <i>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</i>[5] 
and <i>Farrington v. Tokushige</i>,[6] the Court struck down statutes that were 
aimed at eliminating private education.  The statute struck down in <i>Pierce</i>
had banned private schools outright by mandating children's attendance
at public schools.  The statute struck down in <i>Farrington</i> imposed
an extensive and intrusive regulatory regime on so-called &quot;foreign
language schools&quot; in Hawaii.  (It appears that this statute
was primarily an anti-Japanese move, since schools that used the
Hawaiian language were not considered &quot;foreign,&quot; while
Japanese was by far the leading minority language.)  Of these
four cases, two of them -- <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i> -- came to be seen
as the leading ones, and the theory that sees the parent-child
relationship as protected by the Due Process Clause is sometimes
called the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i> doctrine.
<p>
In those days, the Supreme Court
was much in the habit of striking down social legislation and
economic regulation.  The Court was fervently committed to free
market economics and to the philosophy of individualism that goes
with such economics, and it frequently resorted to the argument
that the Constitution itself prohibits laws that regulate the
economic marketplace.  In some cases it used the Constitution's
Contracts Clause[7] of Article II Section 10 of the Constitution,
but it relied even more heavily on the Due Process Clause of the
14th Amendment, which prohibits states from taking life, liberty,
or property without due process of law.
<p>
Some jurists, including Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes,[8] offered the critique 
that was later offered by Robert Bork and others -- that the Due Process Clause
focuses on process rather than substance and does not give the
Court the power to strike down regulations enacted according to
fair procedures.  Holmes, in 1905, like Bork in 1987, stood up
for &quot;the right of a [political] majority to embody their
opinions in law.&quot;  But that other great majority -- a majority
of the Court -- held throughout the early 20th century that the
Due Process Clause protects more than mere due process; it also
prohibits some types of legislation altogether, and may, therefore,
be said to protect &quot;due substance&quot; as well as due process.
<p>
This doctrine, which came to be known as &quot;substantive due
process,&quot; is also the doctrinal matrix of the parents' rights
cases.  The conventional explanation today of the Court's solicitude
both for economic freedom and for parental authority is that the
Court was protecting a class system that depended both on patriarchal
authority and on unrestrained capitalism.[9]  But the need for &quot;hidden
agenda&quot; theories diminishes once one realizes that household
and marketplace are not antitheses, but different points along
a continuum of interconnected human relationships.  The very term
&quot;economics&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;oikos,&quot;
meaning &quot;household.&quot;  (Also underlying the Court's concern
was the right of private school teachers to earn their living
at their chosen profession.[10])
<p>
In the 30's, substantive due process
was a major obstacle to FDR's reforms.  Regardless of where one
stands on the merits of FDR's programs, one does have to recognize
that the electorate wanted change and was getting tired of unelected
and life-tenured judges using esoteric constitutional doctrines
to substitute their philosophy for the philosophy embraced by
the majority of the nation.   FDR's Attorney General, Robert Jackson,
spoke eloquently of how the Court had substituted its own views
of the Constitution for what the Constitution actually says. 
Eventually FDR put Jackson and other liberal jurists on the Court;
the doctrine of substantive due process officially went into discredit
in 1937; and a former clerk to Justice Jackson is now Chief Justice
of the United States.
<p>
Only one strand of substantive due process
survived 1937 -- the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i> doctrine.  It's true that the
Court placed an outer limit on that doctrine in 1944, in <i>Prince
v. Massachusetts</i>,[11] in which it held that <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i> 
do not exempt parents or guardians from the child labor laws.  This case
involved a child's legal guardian who wanted the child to help
her distribute religious literature.  The Court turned aside both
a parents' rights claim and a free exercise of religion claim.
 To this day, <i>Prince</i> is always the first case cited by government
attorneys defending some state action against a constitutional
challenge by parents.  But even in <i>Prince</i>, the Court went out
of its way to clarify that it was not overruling the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i>
doctrine.  It said:
<p>
<blockquote>It is cardinal with us that the custody,
care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose
primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations
the state can neither supply nor hinder.  <i>Pierce, supra</i>.  And
it is in recognition of this that these decisions have respected
the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.
</blockquote><p>
In 1942, two years before <i>Prince</i>, the Court showed the enduring power
of the notion that the Constitution protects certain fundamental
relationships.  The case was <i>Skinner v. Oklahoma</i>,[12] and it struck
down a statute that authorized sterilization as a punishment for
a third conviction for certain crimes (a eugenics-era version
of &quot;three strikes and you're out&quot;).  The case was basically
resolved under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment,
rather than the Due Process Clause, on the theory that Oklahoma
had made an irrational distinction in punishing some crimes by
sterilization while other, similar crimes were not subject to
such punishment.  But the driving force behind the ruling seems
to have been the Court's abhorrence of sterilization as a punishment,
and here the Court brought in the Due Process analysis familiar
from the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i> line of cases.
<p><blockquote>
We are dealing here with
legislation which involves one of the basic rights of man.  Marriage
and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival
of the race.[13]
</blockquote><p>
Notice that here, as in <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i>, the Court
continues to see the protected right as inherently relational.
 It's &quot;marriage and procreation,&quot; neither of which are
solitary activities.  The Court is still protecting relationships,
rather than self-definition by isolated individuals.
<p>
Notice also that the Court has redefined the nature of the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i> 
holdings. It has given them a new lease on life in the post-1937 world
by ignoring their origins in economic substantive due process
and emphasizing instead their protection of the privacy of protected
relationships.
<p>
The next chapter in the development of the constitutional
privacy right was <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i>[14] in 1965.  Here the Court
was faced with a very broad anti-contraceptive statute that it
very much wanted to strike down.  The problem was, how?  The Court
had long since rejected substantive due process, and, with it,
the notion that the Court is entitled to sit as a super-legislature,
striking down duly enacted statutes merely because it disagreed
with them.  Back in the 30's, liberals had thrown out the old
substantive due process that protected economic rights.  Would
the liberals of the 60's bring substantive due process back, so
as to protect privacy?
<p>
The answer was yes -- but they did it carefully.
 In a majority opinion by Justice Douglas, the Court in <i>Griswold</i>
reaffirmed the death of substantive due process and repudiated
the notion of legislating from the bench.[15]  It then looked for
constitution clauses other than the 14th Amendment Due Process
Clause for a way to strike down the statute.  What they came up
with was the theory that the 1st, 4th, and 5th Amendments all
protect privacy in some way;  plus, the 9th Amendment authorizes
judges to find new, non-textual rights;  so, on the whole, a general
right of privacy may be said to be one of the &quot;emanations&quot;
from &quot;penumbras&quot; of those amendments.[16]
<p>
The <i>Griswold</i> opinion has both a moderate face and a radical face.  Its moderate 
face is seen in the fact that the privacy right that it protected was
specifically a right of <i>marital</i> privacy.  The opinion contains
some glowing rhetoric about the importance and sacredness of the
marital relationship.[17] This rhetoric is fully consistent both
with the values of most Americans, and with the theory of relational
privacy as we have seen it in <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i>, and both those
cases were among those cited in <i>Griswold</i>.[18]
<p>
The radical face of <i>Griswold</i> is seen in its headline value.  I have not 
looked up the original newspaper accounts of <i>Griswold</i>, but I feel reasonably 
confident that they did not say &quot;Court Affirms Privacy Doctrine,&quot;
or &quot;Court Embarks on New Substantive Due Process,&quot; or
&quot;Court Does Novel Analysis of 1st, 4th, 5th and 9th Amendments.&quot;
 No:  the real news value of <i>Griswold</i> lay in the fact that by
its effect, though not by its language, it elevated contraception
to the status of a constitutional right.  That elevation had profound
cultural impact.  Formerly, contraception was, no doubt, widely
practiced, but at the same time it lacked cultural cachet.  It
still carried connotations of the unrespectable, the bohemian.
<i>Griswold</i> had the effect of wrapping contraception in the red,
white, and blue; and, in so doing, it placed a certain judicial
seal of approval on the sexual revolution that was then in progress.
<p>
By 1972, the evidence suggested that this was precisely the direction
in which the Court intended to take the new substantive due process.
For instance, while <i>Griswold</i> seemed to create a due process right
to contraception only for married people, the Court in <i>Eisenstadt
v. Baird</i>[19] in 1972 used the Equal Protection Clause to extend the
same right to the unmarried.
<p>
It also completely contradicted the rhetoric in <i>Griswold</i> about marriage: 
whereas <i>Griswold</i> had cited the special, sacred nature of the marital 
relationship as a basis for finding a privacy right,[20] <i>Eisenstadt</i> heaped 
scorn on the notion that marriage is anything special, and affirmed instead
the continuing legal and metaphysical separateness of spouses.
<p>
Let's pause to retrace our steps.  We started in the 20's with <i>Meyer,
Bartels, Pierce</i>, and <i>Farrington</i>, which affirmed a right of privacy
for protected relationships, namely, those of the family.  They
made the family, especially in its role as bearer and rearer of
children, a zone of limited yet real legal autonomy.  We moved
on to <i>Skinner</i>, the sterilization case from 1942, where we saw
that the privacy doctrine had survived the death of substantive
due process and was still available to protect &quot;marriage
and procreation.&quot;  Then we saw <i>Griswold</i>, where procreation
drops out of the picture, and finally, <i>Eisenstadt</i>, where marriage
drops out of the picture.  The privacy right has by this point
become a constitutional right to reject the values that it was
originally designed to protect.
<p>
After <i>Eisenstadt</i>, the stage was set for <i>Roe v. Wade</i>.[21] 
Roe is probably the most analyzed case in legal history, and I'm certainly 
not going to break any new ground under it today.  In terms of the issues 
we're discussing today, there are two remarkable things about <i>Roe</i>.  One is 
that it dropped the pretense, maintained in <i>Griswold</i>, that the Court 
was doing something other than bringing back substantive due process, in
a new form and at the service of a different set of values.  Two,
it marked the final repudiation of the old relational approach
to privacy, where privacy protected relationships, and inaugurated
an era in which privacy stands for a sort of erotic hyper-individualism:
 an individual's right to define him- or herself, especially through
sexual activity, free from all binding commitments, and free from
all encumbrances other than those that the individual freely and
continuously chooses.
<p>
This is really the constitutionalization of the metaphysics of Jean-Paul Sartre 
and the Existentialists, who taught that the human person makes himself through 
his own choices.[22] It follows that choosing is more important than being,
and freedom is &quot;a constantly renewed obligation to remake
the <i>Self</i>....&quot;[23]
<p>
Although <i>Roe</i> contained a few hedges against this isolationist view of 
individualism -- where it says, for instance, that the woman &quot;cannot be 
isolated in her privacy&quot;[24] -- nonetheless, the later abortion cases 
entrenched isolationist individualism further into the Court's evolving 
concept of privacy. For instance, in <i>Planned Parenthood v. Danforth</i>[25] 
in 1975, the Court struck down a paternal consent requirement for abortion.
 The mutation of the privacy doctrine ought not to pass unnoticed.
 In <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i>, it envisioned the parents, as a unit, 
exercising autonomy for the benefit of the child.  By the time we get to
<i>Danforth</i>, we find that it nullifies one parent's rights altogether,
and protects the other parent's autonomy at the expense of the
child.  Another way to look at the matter is that in the 20's,
the privacy right protected the family as such, while in the 70's,
it viewed family ties as one of the chief obstacles to privacy.
<p>
To be sure, the Court has not thrown itself four-square behind the
new view of privacy -- privacy as the individual's right, in isolation
from family and society, to define himself through an ongoing
process of choosing.  If it had, <i>Bowers v. Hardwick</i>[26] would have
come out the other way.  We know this because we have Justice
Blackmun's dissent in that case, which reads like a majority opinion,
which it very nearly was.
<p>
The dissenters in that case, not the majority, had a theory of human freedom, 
albeit one against which many objections could be raised.  The majority simply took 
the position that theories of freedom are one thing, constitutional
law is another, and nothing in the Constitution authorizes the
Court to act as the nation's official philosophy board.  That's
a very strong argument -- but, in a sense, much less interesting
than what the dissenters had to say.
<p>
The Blackmun dissent argued for a broad privacy doctrine while completely and 
explicitly rejecting the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i> view of privacy.  Wrote Justice 
Blackmun: &quot;We protect those rights [referring to marriage and family] not 
because they contribute, in some direct and material way, to the general
public welfare, but because they form so central a part of an
individual's life.&quot;[27]
<p>
For comparison, consider the key statement of the meaning of the privacy doctrine in 
<i>Pierce</i>. Justice McReynolds wrote for the Court:
<p>
<blockquote>The fundamental theory of liberty upon which
all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power
of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept
instruction from public teachers only.  The child is not the mere
creature of the State;  those who nurture him and direct his destiny
have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare
him for additional obligations.[28]
</blockquote><p>
The views of privacy endorsed by the Court in the 1920's, and those that it 
sometimes endorsed in the 1970's, are not absolutely contradictory, but they 
certainly pull in different directions.  Justice McReynolds could, theoretically,
have defended parents' rights in terms of the parents' individual
self-definitions, with their children being mere tools in the
parents' life projects.  Such a view would have been a perfect
fit with that of Blackmun in <i>Bowers</i>.   But instead, McReynolds
coupled parents' rights with parents' duties, and specifically
held that this package of rights and duties is oriented towards
preparing the child &quot;for additional obligations.&quot;  He
does not specify what those obligations are, but, from the very
fact that he views these terms as self-explanatory, we may infer
that he means the ordinary obligations of life in a democratic
republic:  being a good friend and neighbor, participating in
civic life, pulling one's own weight economically, taking care
of one's family, and so forth.[29]
<p>
For the mindset of the 1970's, on the other hand, all those obligations -- the 
claims of family, neighborhood, the political community, etc. -- are just so many
encumbrances on the free choice of the individual.  These two
human prototypes -- 1920's Man and 1970's Man, McReynolds Man
and Blackmun Man -- have barely enough in common even to speak
to each other.  From the point of view of 70's Man, 20's Man is
a bundle of complexes and prejudices who never has any fun.  From
the point of view of 20's Man, 70's Man is rootless and shallow,
a passive consumer of pleasurable sensations, not the sort of
person around whom any real community can be built.
<p>
It cannot be stressed too often, however, that constitutional law does not
necessarily force us to choose between 20's Man and 70's Man as
our preferred human type.  There is always the possibility that
the 14th Amendment does not incorporate either as its preferred
model for human society, but instead leaves that choice up to
the democratic process in the several states, cheerfully anticipating
that some states and localities will go in more of a 20's direction,
and others will go in more of a 70's direction.  This option is
the only one I know of that stands a chance of bringing peace
to our judicial politics.
<p>
As it happens, this option was also the
very one offered by Robert Bork.  Critical of the reasoning of
<i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i> no less than of that of Roe, his philosophy of
sticking narrowly to the constitutional text may have offered
the closest approximation to a truce in the wars over what kind
of privacy, what kind of human person, what kind of society is
envisioned in the 14th Amendment.  The story of his confirmation
battle is the story of how the partisans of 20's Man were willing
to accept this truce, but the partisans of 70's Man were not.
 The truce was rejected; the wars go on, judicially as well as
culturally.
<p>
Today it is simply a given, in the courts and in the
law reviews, that the Constitution protects privacy, <i>in some sense.</i>
 What sense precisely, future cases will have to tell.  The 90's
are not the 20's, but neither are they the 70's.

In the early 20th century, American businessmen and lawyers were willing to effect this transfer.

<title>Observations About America's Welfare Crisis</title>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2>OBSERVATIONS ABOUT<br>
AMERICA'S WELFARE CRISIS</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Jennifer E. Marshall</i></center>
<p>
<li><b>On Responsibility.</b> For a man to enjoy freedom,
he must accept responsibility for his own acts.  The failure to
accept responsibility denies man basic human dignity.
<p>
The problem with the welfare system is that it suppresses a sense
of personal responsibility and negates freedom and dignity in
the bargain.
<p>
The system neither demands nor rewards responsible behavior. 
Instead, it pays benefits to those who spurn virtue and, in so
doing, makes a mockery of responsible citizens.
<p>
Franklin D. Roosevelt said that &quot;welfare is a narcotic, a
subtle destroyer of the human spirit,&quot; and Alexander Hamilton
observed that &quot;a power over a man's subsistence amounts to
a power over his will.&quot;
<p>
By creating a culture of dependency, we have reduced a potentially
proud and independent people to passive clients.  We have told
them, not that they are equal to the inevitable challenges of
life, but that they are helpless -- a different, less human kind
of breed than the rest of us who can and do live by the rules.
<p>
Welfare bureaucrats say, &quot;You can't do this.  Let us do it
for you.  And pay us to do it with your vote, year after year.&quot;
 And so we are empowering the bureaucracy at the same time we
are destroying individuals, and children are inheriting not only
material poverty but their parents' poverty of the spirit.
<p>
<li><b>On Compassion.</b> The problem of the 1990s is no
longer &quot;poverty,&quot; but, rather, &quot;dependency.&quot;
 And the problem of dependency is primarily a moral problem.
<p>
Government policy that provides money to the poor, while encouraging
them to act in ways that ensure dependency, is not compassionate.
 That's &quot;compassion&quot; that kills, and even liberals have
begun to see the light.
<p>
In a December 15, 1986 article in <i>The New Republic</i>, liberal
social critic Mickey Kaus admitted that &quot;compassion . . .
is a miserable basis for liberal politics.  It carries the unmistakable
implication of dependence and piteousness on the part of those
on the receiving end of the sentiment. . . .  [I]t provides no
principle to tell us when our abstract compassionate impulses
should stop . . . which is why a politics based on mass-produced
compassion leads naturally to the indiscriminate dispensing of
cash.&quot;
<p>
Compassion instead must be defined as the potential to effect
change in the current system -- because the current system is
synonymous with misery.
<p>
And the principle behind that change must be a new sense of limits,
based on the discrimination between good and bad behavior.
<p>
In her book <i>Poverty and Compassion</i>, Gertrude Himmelfarb
suggested that we must be determined, not just to feel good about
ourselves, but to do good to others.  And sometimes it is necessary
to feel bad ourselves and to curb our run-away compassion, in
order to serve the best interests of others.
<p>
<li><b>On Illegitimacy.</b> Can we doubt that a system
that subsidizes illegitimacy perpetuates illegitimacy -- and creates
social chaos?  Listen to the testimony of one woman on welfare,
quoted in the March 1995 <i>Reader's Digest</i>:  &quot;Welfare
is an enabler.  It's not that you want to be in that situation.
 But it's there.  We always know.&quot;  
<p>
In other words, welfare enables unmitigated disaster -- by making
it increasingly difficult for the poor to make the right choices
which they otherwise are fully capable of making.  
<p>
Welfare destroys individuals first, and then the destruction moves
outward in concentric circles to consume the entire community.
 When illegitimacy reaches a critical mass -- as it already has
in many communities, both black and white -- the neighborhood
effects create problems that extend far beyond the recipients
of welfare.
<p>
Community values and the norms for male
behavior are changed, and with them the behavior of young men
and women who never touch an AFDC check.  Thus, the effect
of those checks springs not only from discrete changes in economic
incentives but from a larger, more pervasive effect on the formation
of character among poor young people.
<p>
Great Society programs shared a common assumption:  that the poor
are victims in the grip of larger forces.  We are all victims
now, of large destructive forces of our own making -- and no one
is more victimized than the poor themselves.
<p>
<li><b>On Family Formation.</b> By subsidizing illegitimacy,
we have turned our inner cities into a wasteland.  And we can't
expect to roll back the tide until we discover some means to ensure
that more children grow up with a father in the home.
<p>
Families socialize children, and persons of a utopian bent of
mind are wrong in thinking that we can replace the family by some
kind of government construct that will accomplish the same ends.
 We have tried that, and we have failed miserably.
<p>
Liberals made their mistake in assuming that virtues like selflessness
and generosity are a part of human nature.  To the contrary, any
right impulse that man possesses must take shape and form within
the family -- or else it will not form at all.
<p>
Even <i>Newsweek</i> has announced that &quot;the name of the
game is shame,&quot; but shame springs up spontaneously only when
children experience loving family relationships that make them
care about how their actions will impact those around them.  Children
who don't feel the love of family can't feel remorse.  They just
feel the pain that inevitably results from violating the laws
of society and of &quot;Nature's God.&quot;
<p>
And so, for the sake of the children, we are justified in taking
whatever means are available to a free people to ensure that intact
families are once again the norm.
<p>
If we don't take action, one of every 2 babies will be born to
a single mother within the next 20 years.  That's a fact we can't
live with.
<P>
<li><b>On Cultural Decline.</b> Peggy Noonan has said that
we have all had a moment when we suddenly realized that the world
was changing before our very eyes -- and not for the better. 
For her, the moment came at a graduation ceremony when the audience
stood up and applauded a senior who would soon give birth to a
baby minus a father.
<p>
Noonan wrote in the September 14, 1992 issue of <i>Forbes</i>:
 &quot;In the sound of that applause I heard a wall falling, a
thousand-year wall, a wall of sanctions that said: We as a society
do not approve of teenaged unwed motherhood because it is not
good for the child, not good for the mother, and not good for
us.&quot;
<p>
What we applaud, we encourage; and we do a grave disservice to
young women and their children when we refuse to draw lines between
right and wrong.
<p>
We can disapprove and yet still provide help -- but we cannot
make that critical distinction by guaranteeing a right to cash
benefits independent of the obligation to good conduct.
<p>
The only real help comes from private individuals and organizations
that sponsor moral renewal at the same time they offer material
support.  Since it's far easier to receive a check in the mail,
no questions asked, welfare denies its dependents the chance to
get real help -- the kind of help that changes lives.
<p>
<li><b>On The Needs of Our Children.</b> James Q. Wilson
said in the 1994 Wriston Lecture at the Manhattan Institute that,
rather than focusing on how to reduce poverty or dependency, we
must set our sights on saving the children.
<p>
We must focus on the dictum that, for a child to thrive, he needs
the &quot;irrational involvement&quot; of two parents who love
him fiercely.
<p>
The problem is that a teenage mother is still a child herself,
with all the distractions and conflicting emotions of adolescence
at play.
<p>
She must contend not only with earaches and two-year-old tantrums,
but with her own broken dreams of any realistic chance at a better
life.
<p>
Three-fourths of illegitimate births among whites alone are to
women with a high school education or less; and, the younger the
single mother, the less likely she is to finish high school.
<p>
The kindest policy we could adopt is one that ensures that young
unwed mothers will have to live either at home with their families
or in group homes.  Not only would the young mother have the help
and supervision of adults on a daily basis, but her child would
be far less likely to suffer abuse or neglect.
<p>
Children born out of wedlock are statistically much more likely
to be abused.  And it is alone at night in an empty apartment
that a tired young mother is most likely to react with anger at
the sound of a crying baby.
<p>
Studies show that the high rate of out-of-wedlock births to young
mothers is the primary explanation for America's low international
standing on measures of infant mortality.
<p>
If we really want to end the suffering of children, we should
end the government subsidies that enable children to bear children.
<P>
<li><b>On Fatherlessness.</b> More than 70% of all juveniles
in state reform institutions come from fatherless homes.  The
likelihood that a young male will engage in criminal activities
doubles if he is raised without a father and triples if he lives
in a neighborhood with a high concentration of single-parent families.
<p>
While shocking, the statistics should not take us completely by
surprise.  Young males are a problematic sex, and they require
socialization that only fathers can provide.
<p>
If not socialized into responsible adult behavior and, as it turns
out, into responsible sexual behavior, young men are dangerous.
 Social scientists are just now beginning to say, in their bloodless
way, what policemen have known for years -- in a <i>not</i> so
bloodless way.
<p>
It is not enough to say that certain kinds of welfare reforms
will cause suffering.  We have to come to terms with the degree
of suffering that's occurring right now.
<p>
And we have to include in the body count the number of children
who fall prey to the violent crime that results from, as James
Q. Wilson put it, &quot;neglecting the processes by which the
underclass reproduces itself.&quot;
<p>
We can maintain our broad legal freedoms -- and our lives -- <i>only</i>
if we manage to instill in our children a degree of self-restraint.
 And we can cultivate that restraint only by turning the hearts
of the fathers to the children.
<p>
<li><b>On Building Community.</b> The welfare system does
not represent the intended relation of free and equal citizens.
 In fact, welfare practically precludes <i>any</i> relationship
between rich and poor.
<p>
Benefit checks amount to essentially tribute money.  In exchange
for our money, we ask that the poor simply leave us alone.
<p>
We hope that the state will make them comfortable, but the paying
of checks by an impersonal bureaucracy requires no personal
involvement on our part.
<p>
Do we realize the implications?
<p>
We have reinstituted segregation -- though not along lines of
race -- because the underclass culture fosters alienation.  Already
we are divided by the distance between &quot;middle-class&quot;
values and the moral anarchy of the inner city, and we will find
it increasingly appealing to create a modern analogue of the Indian
reservation to house the people we fear.
<p>
Our hope lies in the private transactions in which we meet individuals
in need of help, not as clients, but as fellow human beings. 
Tocqueville explained: &quot;Private charity establishes valuable
ties between the rich and the poor by involving the giver in the
fate of the one whose poverty he has undertaken to alleviate.
 Although divided by circumstance, they are willingly reconciled.&quot;
<p>
This is a country badly in need of healing, not of new and deeper
divisions.  But we will have to change welfare if we want to stymie
the secession of the poor from middle-class life -- and from the
common experience of freedom, as the Founders meant it.

<title>Hearing on the Administration's Aids Training Program</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2>HEARING ON THE<br>
ADMINISTRATION'S AIDS<br>
TRAINING PROGRAM</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<h4>Testimony of Robert L. Maginnis, Policy Analyst<br>
Family Research Council<br>
for House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight<br>
Subcommittee on Civil Service<br>
Representative John L. Mica, Chairman<br>
June 22, 1995</h4></center>
<p>
Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, it is a pleasure
to address you today concerning the Administration's AIDS training
program.
<p>
President Clinton announced on September 30, 1993 to all heads
of executive departments his HIV/AIDS policy.  The policy requires
each departmental secretary to designate a senior staff member
to implement HIV/AIDS training programs and to develop workplace
policies for employees with HIV/AIDS.
<p>
The training has received a mixed review.  Some federal employees
have called the Family Research Council to complain that they
found the training offensive.  Others have said it was relatively
benign.
<p>
The Administration's AIDS awareness training has numerous problems.
 It does not reduce the risks of contracting HIV, and it merely
recites the provisions outlined in the Americans with Disabilities
Act.  The training duplicates other federal AIDS education programs,
and it has been used to promote homosexuality.
<p>
You asked me to address four questions.
<p>
<b>First, does the training meet the statutory objective?</b>
<p>
The governing statute defines &quot;training&quot; as &quot;the
process of providing for and making available to an employee ...[information]...which
will improve individual and organizational performance and assist
in achieving the agency's mission and performance goals.&quot;
<p>
It remains a mystery as to how this training meets the objective.
 The government's publications provide little help.  For example,
the Treasury Department's AIDS awareness booklet quotes President Clinton,
&quot;We need to set an example.&quot;  An example of what?
<p>
The Agriculture Department outlined its training goals:  to shatter
the myths about AIDS, explain how to treat people with AIDS, to
encourage employees to keep an open mind to better understand
AIDS, and to emphasize that AIDS is difficult to contract.  There
was no attempt to link the agency's mission and goals with the
training.
<p>
While Agriculture's AIDS goals could also be made for cancer or
heart disease, which kill many more Americans every year, the
federal government doesn't mandate three hours of training to
prevent these diseases.
<p>
In fact, federal government-sponsored AIDS awareness training
may have been a good idea in 1987.  But after spending $500 million
per year on AIDS education for many years, the Clinton Administration's
program appears to be a total waste of taxpayer money.
<p>
Conservative estimates of the costs to the taxpayer of  the Administration's
program are over $80 million in lost productivity, material, and
fees.  Congress should demand a full accounting.   
<p>
The Administration's AIDS program focuses almost exclusively on
awareness and has little impact on behavior change.  Since HIV
is contracted through behavior and not from breathing bad air,
training that ignores diagnosis and fails to contribute to behavior
modification will have minimal impact.
<p>
<b>Second, what have federal civil servants told me about the
training?</b>
<p>
I've heard from civil servants throughout the government.  They
complain that the training was offensive, a big joke, a waste
of time, and that it promoted homosexuality.   Most objected that
the training was mandatory and those who protested were threatened
with adverse personnel actions.
<p>
The training includes a brief history of HIV, symptoms and some
emphasis on prevention and risk reduction.  There is a discussion
of needle sharing and sexual contact.  Federal employees are told
to reduce their HIV contraction risk by practicing &quot;safer
sex&quot; by using barriers like condoms, dental dams, plastic
wrap, and latex gloves.  An employee manual states, &quot;A dental
dam or plastic wrap may be used for any oral-vaginal or oral-anal
contact.  All types of barriers are effective against HIV transmission
only if they are used correctly and consistently from start to
finish.&quot;
<p>
One employee labeled the training as a glorified high school sex
education class with sensitivity training on the side.  Others
objected to the graphic explanations of sexual activities.
<p>
<b>Third, what kind of AIDS training is appropriate for the federal
workplace?</b>
<p>
The federal government spends billions of dollars each year on
AIDS research, education, and treatment.  Much of that money is
wasted because it fails to involve diagnosis.  If the government
wants to impact the epidemic in the workforce, it must link HIV
diagnosis with follow-up counseling and training.
<p>
Such a program would be less expensive than the Administration's
program and far more productive.  For example, an AIDS test now
costs about $2.49.  The federal government could test the &quot;at-risk&quot;
civil servants and then, with the results in hand, provide confidential
follow-up counseling and training.
<p>
Limiting the spread of the virus through behavior reinforcement
or modification should be a top priority.  A test-linked program
is the only meaningful type of training that will help arrest
the epidemic.
<p>
<b>Finally, is legislation needed to better define the kinds of
training in the federal workplace?</b>
<p>
Yes.  Most of the AIDS training is not offensive.  But there are
alarming exceptions.  For example, the Forest Service's Tahoe
Region sponsored AIDS training last year.  It was conducted by
a sexologist, a self-described homosexual phlebotomist, and an
HIV-positive woman from the community.
<p>
The phlebotomist was an ex-convict who tried to debunk &quot;homophobic&quot;
attitudes.  He speculated that many husbands were involved in
homosexual affairs.  He showed a variety of condoms and how to
apply them to a life-size replica of erect male genitalia.  He
even explained a technique for using one's mouth to apply the
condom.  He also explained the proper cleaning techniques when
sharing hypodermic needles.
<p>
In conclusion, the Clinton Administration mandated AIDS awareness
training to appease activists and to provide a platform for the
promotion of homosexuality as the moral equivalent of heterosexuality.
 This training is a subset of the diversity agenda which permeates
the federal bureaucracy today.
<p>
Congress should pass legislation that limits training to the clearly
defined statutory objectives.  Training should not promote a particular
political agenda, redefine the family to include homosexual couples,
or include offensive material.  Training, also should be job related.

<title>Disestablishing the Department of Education</title>

<h2>DISESTABLISHING THE<br>
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<h4>Testimony of Robert G. Morrison<br>
Education Policy Analyst<br>
Family Research Council<br>
before the House Committee on Economic<br>
and Educational Opportunities<br>
June 29, 1995</h4></center>
<p>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:  my name is Robert
G. Morrison and I am here to represent Gary Bauer and the Family
Research Council.  Our organization serves more than 250,000 members
nationwide.  I served with Gary Bauer in the U.S. Department of
Education from 1985-87.  My testimony today will call for the
disestablishment of the Department of Education and the repeal
of Goals 2000, the Educate America Act.
<p>
In 1979, when President Jimmy Carter first proposed the creation
of a U.S. Department of Education to repay the National Education
Association for its political support,  columnist Marvin Stone
warned of  the centralization of power over education:  writing
for <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I>, Stone asked:  &quot;Would
the Education Department have the power to tamper with America's
traditional local control of education?  Of course it would. 
Where there is money to be given, there is the implicit responsibility
to make sure that it is spent according to the purposes of the
donors -- or else.&quot;  Despite half-hearted objections at the
time, the Department has moved inexorably toward greater and greater
control over local education.  With Goals 2000, the U.S. Education
Department and other federal bureaucracies seek to tighten their
grip on the genuine education reform movement and extinguish it.
<p>
Of course, these ceaseless efforts at centralization will fail.
 They must fail, because they sap local community spirit and individual
responsibility.  They must fail because, as Mr. Jefferson said:
 &quot;If we waited for Washington to tell us when to sow and
when to reap, we should soon want bread.&quot;  They must fail
for an even more profound reason.  Alexis de Tocqueville has been
recently quoted both by President Bill Clinton and by Speaker
Gingrich.  But Tocqueville, as a genius of political science,
explained <I>why</I> the attempt to centralize administration
ultimately fails.
<p>
<blockquote><i>However enlightened and skillful a central power may be, it
cannot of itself embrace all the details of the life of a great nation.
 Such vigilance exceeds the powers of man. And when it attempts
unaided to create and set in motion so many complicated springs,
it must submit to a very imperfect result or exhaust itself in
bootless efforts.
<p>
Alexis de Tocqueville<br>
Democracy in America, 1835</i></blockquote>
<p>
&quot;Imperfect results&quot; and  &quot;bootless efforts&quot;
pretty well describe the record of the U.S. Education Department.
 Under the spur of Goals 2000, the Department has seen fit to
endorse the new national history standards.  These politically-correct
standards seek to teach all American students that Madonna and
the Simpsons are significant figures, while neglecting Paul Revere,
the Wright Brothers, Marian Anderson and Jonas Salk.  They speak
of &quot;Soviet advances in space&quot; and the <I>Challenger</I>
disaster, while completely omitting the U.S. landing on the moon
even though Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., a respected liberal historian,
has said that the moon landing may be the most significant event
of the twentieth century.  Worse, the standards could be fairly
termed &quot;anti-American&quot; history standards because they
teach young people that U.S.-Soviet &quot;swordplay&quot; led
to the American involvement in Korea, Vietnam and U.S. interventions
around the world.  Never do the standards speak of Soviet invasions
of Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Afghanistan.  Never do the standards
acknowledge communist efforts at subversion in the U.S. or Western
Europe.  We urge this committee and the full House to join the
Senate in denouncing these history standards.
<p>
Not only do we at Family Research Council believe that the national
history standards that have been produced are unacceptable, we
believe that <I>any</I> effort of the federal government to dispense
official truth is misguided and dangerous.  We have only to look
at the Clinton administration's recently reported failure in the
area of childhood immunizations to recognize the harm that government
can do when it manufactures a crisis based on faulty data and
a political agenda.  Yet, if there are any of our liberal friends
who still defend the idea of a political determination of  U.S.
history, we would ask them to consider this:  what if national
history and economics standards were to be devised by Professor
Gingrich, Professor Gramm and Professor Armey?
<p>
The reality in contemporary American life is that parents, taxpayers
and citizens generally are not of one accord about all education
programs.  There is broad support, measured by polls, for safe
and drug-free schools.  There is consistent public backing for
schools which teach children reading, writing, arithmetic and
history, for schools which impart reliable standards of right
and wrong.  But there is no stable consensus on many other hotly-debated
issues.   Family life and sex education continue to be points
of contention.  Methods of teaching reading, similarly, divide
Americans.  So, too, does the teaching of evolution.  Even bilingual
education is fraught with controversy.  What the Education Department
and Goals 2000 do is put the federal government in the middle
of all these controversies. 
<p>
When the federal government becomes an antagonist, it is viewed
increasingly as hostile to one or another group of parents or
interests.  That is why we at Family Research Council support
the <I>disestablishment </I>of the U.S. Department of Education
and the <I>repeal</I> of Goals 2000.  We seek the return of decision-making
 authority  to local communities -- to elected school boards which
are close to the people they serve.  We also strongly support
parental choice of schools.  Only when every parent can freely
choose a safe and effective public, private, religious or home
school will we have an end to the interminable clashes over education
and values. 
<p>
Many in the education establishment, we know, question whether
parents are capable of wisely choosing a school for their children. 
To this we can only answer:  if parents are capable of choosing presidents, 
governors and members of congress, then surely they can choose a school.
 Further, if advocates of a public school monopoly persist on
this point, we must challenge them.  If Americans cannot make
an<I> educated</I> choice of schools for their own children, whom
they love, then who bears the responsibility for their failure?
We have had compulsory public schools in this country for a century
and a half.  Nearly ninety percent of Americans attend those schools.
 The fact is, of course, parental choice works.  That's why some
of those most knowledgeable about education -- including teachers'
union members, the Clintons and the Gores -- choose their own
children's' schools. 
<p>
Our vision for education reform includes a de-centralization of
decision-making which will not only be effective in getting us
&quot;back to basics,&quot;  but which will also reinvigorate
democracy at the grassroots.  One of the reasons why Goals 2000
will fail is because it saps local initiative and disperses accountability.
 There are also historical reasons.  We have attempted a more
modest, arguably a more realistic national goals effort before.
<p>
In 1984, the Reagan administration sought to set out Goals 1990.
 It hoped to have American students recoup just <I>one-half</I>
of the points lost in the SATs since the mid-60s.  Initially,
there were some hopeful upticks.  But, by the end of the decade
of the 80s, it became clear that American students were not listening
to even the best lectures from the Bully Pulpit.  In 1990, President
Reagan had retired to California, deservedly honored for his central
role in the defeat of communism, respected throughout the world
for unleashing a great and productive economy and looked to with
gratitude by millions of American families for his championing
of parental rights and traditional values.  No one criticized
Ronald Reagan for the failure of U.S. students to achieve Goals
1990. 
<p>
The education establishment says that &quot;kids deserve a place
at the table with the President.&quot;  It's an attractive soundbite.
 But it would be far better for us to have a nation of  &quot;education
mothers and fathers&quot; and empowered local education leaders
than it would be to hold out a role for the President or Congress
that is neither realistic nor constitutionally appropriate.  The
truth is, the President and Congress are always going to be preoccupied
with taxing and trading, with national defense and international
cooperation.  We need to move beyond &quot;kids as props&quot;
to show Washington's intimate concern for education. 
<p>
This Congress has before it legislation which will disestablish
the Department of Education and repeal Goals 2000.  Family Research
Council shares these objectives.  We look forward to working with
the members of this committee and with your staff to perfect it.
 We urge this committee to give the resources and the responsibility
back to the parents, taxpayers and locally elected leaders who
can most effectively act to improve education. 
<p>
To de-centralize education decision-making is to recognize once
again &quot;the genius of the people&quot; of which Madison spoke
in <I>The Federalist Papers</I>.  By disestablishing the U.S.
Department of Education and repealing Goals 2000, this Congress
will demonstrate its respect for the Constitution and, especially,
the Tenth Amendment.  This Congress will show that it listens
to the petitions and the concerns of millions of parents.  Congress
will also prove that it is serious about cutting wasteful federal
spending.  While this action may not gain this body the title
of  the &quot;Education Congress&quot; from the vested interest,
it will win for this Congress a new measure of gratitude and respect
for restoring &quot;Democracy in America.&quot;

<h2>HOMESCHOOLERS:<br>
PIONEERS OF FREEDOM</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>Robert G. Morrison</i></center>
<p>
We have in our office &quot;Goals 1996.&quot;  We're moving a little bit
more quickly than Goals 2000.  Our goals for 1996 include the
dis-establishment of the U.S. Department of Education, to undo
what President Carter did back in 1979.  He created the department
to meet a commitment that he made to the National Education Association.
 We opposed the creation of a Department of Education in 1979,
and we've seen nothing in the last 16 years to justify its continued
existence. Our sincere belief is that the appropriate federal
role in education is no federal role in education.  Our Constitution
does not call upon our federal government to be running schools
from Washington, D.C.  We will very energetically support other
leaders in Washington trying to dis-establish the U.S. Department
of Education.  The key point is that $70 billion of our money
goes into Washington, D.C. to be spent on education, money we
think can be better spent by states and communities and localities
and, most importantly, by parents and taxpayers themselves.  Our
emphasis is going to be on local schools and local leaders.
<p>
We're also going to call for the repeal of Goals 2000 legislation which
was passed last year.  Now, Goals 2000 is one of the most important
education bills ever in this respect:  it is, in effect, the nationalization
of American public education, bringing more power and authority
into Washington, D.C.  It's very interesting that this happened
because, at the same time, the United States considered a health
care plan which was devised by Ira Magaziner and Mrs. Clinton,
a health care plan which would have centralized authority and
power and eliminated choices.  The American people and their Congress
rightly considered and, we believe, rightly rejected that idea.
  But that's because there was a serious national debate, and
we actually looked into the plan and carefully analyzed it.  Americans
understood what they were being offered and said, &quot;No, we
don't want it.&quot;
<p>
Unfortunately, we did not get the same quality
of debate and discussion about Goals 2000 that we did about the
Clinton health care plan.  Interestingly, Ira Magaziner and Hillary
Clinton played a part in devising the Goals 2000 plan over the
last half decade or more as well.  But we're not here to represent
one political party or another, and we have to be fair because
President Bush actually introduced America 2000 back in 1991.
 His Secretary of Education, Lamar Alexander, supported America
2000.  Now we think Goals 2000 is even worse than America 2000.
 But the principle had given way, and too much control was already
coming to Washington in America 2000.
<p>
It made it very difficult to leverage opposition to Goals 2000 in Washington
when a lot of the Republican members on Capitol Hill said, &quot;How
can we vote against Goals 2000?  Didn't we endorse pretty much
the same thing just a year or so ago?&quot;
<p>
We said, &quot;Yes, regrettably you did, and we were trying to talk to you about 
that, but we didn't get anyone's attention.&quot;
<p>
So now we are working on the repeal of Goals 2000.  Let me draw from my Coast 
Guard days to create a metaphor.  If you look at the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act, it's a huge liner. It's an $11.6 billion
piece of legislation, another bill to extend power and authority
over our communities.  Most states cannot say no to their share
of $11.6 billion.  If you look at Goals 2000, it doesn't look
that big.  It's only $700 million.  I realize I'm working in Washington
where you talk about a billion here, a billion there -- pretty
soon you're talking about money.   But if you think of Goals 2000
as a small tugboat guiding and pushing that huge liner, you'll
get an idea as to why Goals 2000 is so vital.  It's not that big
money is involved, but it's the power and direction that the program
gives.
<p>
One of the reasons I especially wanted to come speak to
you is to express our deep gratitude and appreciation to you as
homeschoolers for what you have done to help transform the picture
in Washington.  I'm talking about what happened last year with
H.R. 6, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, that was going
through the House of Representatives.  When you were threatened
with something called the Miller Amendment, which had the potential
almost to outlaw private education, religious schools and homeschools
in the effect that it would have had down the line, you created
a sensation in Washington, D.C.  A sensation, I should mention,
that has never really been noticed by the Washington Post, the
New York Times, Dan Rather or Connie Chung.  Maybe we'll just
try to get Gary to whisper it to Connie Chung....
<p>
It was a major event to be there at ground zero, with hundreds of thousands
of phone calls coming in from all over America about H.R. 6. 
Not every member of Congress had been following H.R. 6 with rapt
attention.  Many of them were interested in the agriculture bill,
the trade bill, or NAFTA, or military issues or foreign trade
-- all these other things -- and they weren't too concerned about
what was going on in a committee about education.  But all of
a sudden their phones lit up.  They couldn't make any phone calls
in or out, their faxes were completely tied up, and they were
finally saying, &quot;What are they talking about?  Who are they?&quot;
 Well, there's a sign chiseled in the House of Representatives,
right over one of the passages, that says, &quot;Here, sir, the
people rule.&quot;  They are the people, sir.   That's who's calling
you.  That's where you're getting your phone calls from.  We recognize
and honor the role of leaders, leaders like Carol Lee Adams, the
homeschooling mother in New Jersey who actually brought this whole
thing to our attention.  She immediately contacted Michael Farris,
us, and a committee staff on Capitol Hill.  We certainly honor
leaders like Dr. Dobson and Gary Bauer, but none of this could
have happened if you just had a group of leaders calling each
other and expressing their indignation.  None of this earthquake
could have occurred unless there was this coast-to-coast, popular
uprising against this very dangerous bill.  So that's why I wanted
to come and thank the earthquake for what happened there.
<p>
What happened on Capitol Hill reminds me of the parable in the Gospel
of Luke of the widow and the unjust judge.  &quot;And for a while,
[the judge] was unwilling.  But afterward he said to himself,
even though I do not fear God nor respect man, yet because this
widow bothers me, I will give her legal protection, lest by her
continually coming she wear me out.&quot;   I like that, but,
of course, in Washington, not everyone likes you to cite Scripture.
 So I would recommend to those believers in the gospel of Charles
Darwin that you ought to at least recognize that you don't come
between a she-bear and her cubs.  That is a very dangerous thing
to do.
<p>
The lesson to draw from this blitz over H.R. 6 is the
need for accurate and timely communication.  We are moving very
quickly with fax networks, telephone trees, with newsletters,
with radio broadcasts, and even on the Internet.  We have the
ability to communicate with one another quickly and accurately
to check information.  That is a major step forward that is going
to be used by the pro-family movement generally, and especially
by homeschoolers.  I think it also proves to us that, in our time,
decentralization of power is a reality.  We do not believe that
Washington, D.C. has all the answers to all the problems in our
lives.  And decentralization of information is making possible
a revitalization of local democracy.  So decentralization works.
<p>
I think it also proves to us that Americans are capable.  For
a long time now we have proceeded on the idea that Americans don't
know how to run their own affairs.  With all of these legislative
measures that have come through, be it the health care plan, be
it the education plan, even in many ways in the crime bill, it
was assumed that we had to go to Washington with our hats in hands
saying, &quot;Please, our rulers, will you govern us?  Will you
somehow free us from our local problems?&quot;  The  H.R. 6 battle
proved that Americans are capable.
<p>
The homeschooling movement is much more than this remarkable episode over H.R. 6. 
I honor the commitment that homeschoolers make, and I have found some
things about the movement that I think are important to all Americans.
<p>
I know one of the first questions that you are all asked is,
&quot;How will your children be socialized if they are homsechooled?&quot;
 That has been one of the major concerns of American public education.
 I have always thought that you may fail there -- you may not
actually meet the national standards in <i>socialization</i> of kids
-- but your children will instead be <i>civilized</i> and that wouldn't
be bad at all.
<p>
You have also taught a lesson in democracy to
the entire country.  We have two drop-out problems in our country.
  One is the school drop-out rate.  But I'd say there's another
drop-out problem that gets less attention, and that's the drop-out
of citizens.  In this great free republic of ours in 1994, only
39% of eligible Americans voted in the Congressional elections.
 These were perhaps the most important Congressional elections
in a generation, yet only 39% voted.  That, by the way, was a
very good turn-out for an off-year election, the best in over
20 years.  But nonetheless, it suggested six out of 10 Americans
did not even exercise the right to vote which was bought with
blood for them.  That's not America the way it ought to be.  
We need to have more citizens engaged.  Homeschoolers are teaching
a lesson in citizen involvement that I think is very important,
and that is gaining respect, even from some people who are not
otherwise sympathetic.  William Raspberry, a leading columnist
in Washington, D.C., is generally liberal and many times writes
columns that I do not agree with.  But William Raspberry has been
kindly disposed toward homeschoolers.
<p>
Homeschoolers are doing something for all of us as American citizens, whether 
we homeschool our children or not.  A hundred years ago, Frederick Jackson Turner,
a great American historian, spoke about the closing of the American
frontier.  He cited it as a significant event in American history
because the frontier had affected the entire development of our
country and our institutions.  The famous Turner thesis was that,
if you were living on the Eastern Seaboard or in the Midwest,
and if your  employer, if your community, even if your family
or church, if any of the structured institutions in your life
became oppressive to you, if they crushed your spirit, you always
had the option of going out to territories and starting a new
life.  This westward movement was a constant in American life.
<p>
Though we no longer have that kind of frontier, homeschoolers
are pioneers in a very real sense, creating a new option, a new
frontier in education that benefits every American citizen.  By
sometimes wrestling, sometimes litigating, sometimes battling
with the state authorities, homeschoolers bring the state into
a right relationship with the citizens.  It's no longer master
and servant, senior and subject, but basically citizen and government.
 When a state government recognizes the right of parents to educate
their own children -- and note I say recognize but not grant,
because it is a <i>recognition</i> that we seek -- when the state recognizes
that right, it comes into a proper relationship and all of us
benefit.  We are all strengthened by what homeschoolers are doing.
<p>
Homeschoolers are also restoring some of the academic seriousness
in education through a commitment to educational excellence. 
So much of what we've seen in education is tragic.  In the teaching
of reading there has been an obvious &quot;dumbing down&quot;
of Americans.  The Department of Education itself admitted in
October of 1993 in a national adult literacy survey that 46% of
Americans could read at a level beyond the rudimentary level --
less than half of American adults could read anything beyond a
rudimentary level.  Now we have to have historical memory and
compare that with our own past.  James McPherson, a Civil War
historian, tells us that 90% of Union soldiers in the Civil War
were literate.  80% of Confederate soldiers in the Civil War were
literate.  Compare that with 46% today.  I would challenge any
of the opponents of homeschooling to see homeschooled children
anywhere in the United States who are not getting that vital basic
skill of reading.
<p>
I believe we must recognize what so often is
not recognized in our public education establishment:  the vital
importance of the Bible as a way to transmit literacy.  E.D. Hirsch,
a professor at the University of Virginia and neither a Christian
nor a conservative, has written a book on cultural literacy in
which he points to the Bible as the basis for English language
literacy.  He cited a fascinating example about India, where there
are over 400 languages.  In order to have a unified country, to
conduct debates in the Indian parliament or to conduct business
or commerce, Indians must speak English.  It's the only common
language they have, and the people of India must be familiar with
the Bible so they can understand the wealth of images and sayings
of the English language.  How else to understand the cultural
concepts of &quot;go the extra mile,&quot; the widow and the unjust
judge, David and Goliath and a host of other references that come
from Scripture.  Yet, our public education establishment has been
militantly opposed to imparting a greater knowledge of the Bible
to our young people.
<p>
Homeschoolers promote the importance of fiscal
responsibility.  Many of you are making a tremendous sacrifice
to educate your children, but you do so efficiently and wisely.
 In contrast, it costs the United States taxpayers in our country
some $5,500 per child to achieve not very great results in education.
 That is a national tragedy.  And all we ever hear is that they
need more, they need more.  Several years ago I met a very fine
public school principal down in Alabama who agreed with us on
so many things, yet he said, &quot;You people are always arguing
for less money for education.  We need more. And the reason that
we need more is that we don't have enough toilet paper in our
high school.  And that just is an example of how awful things
are.&quot;  Well, this roll I hold in my hand I got from a homeschool
-- I can tell you there's plenty wherever private enterprise reigns.
 The one place I know where there was a lack of such things was
on Soviet ships when they had to call Moscow and say, &quot;Hey,
we need basic commodities.&quot;  Albert Shanker, the head of
the American Federation of Teachers, has compared American public
education to Soviet agriculture, and I have an idea of what he
means.
<p>
The final thing I will say is that we've seen the involvement
of parents, of husbands and wives, coming closer together with
their children, and that has been characteristic of the homeschool
movement.  As I sat there in Washington during the H.R. 6 battle
and got hundreds of phone calls, 90% percent of them were from
mothers who were deeply concerned for the welfare of their children.
 I thought what a remarkable thing it was, and that people in
the secular political world who do studies and  write columns
ought to pay attention to this, because what you are seeing is
not a woman's movement, but a mother's movement.  You are seeing
a new movement, a new thing happening in American society.  The
feminist movement, theoretically put, argued for barriers between
mother and child in their advocacy of abortion on demand, barriers
and conflict between husbands and wives, barriers even between
women and their God.  In the homeschooling movement we have seen
all of those conflicts be resolved and all of those barriers come
down.  That's why I find homeschooling so exciting, and why I
will invite the interest of many of our friends in the press and
the academic community to study it and see this new thing happening
in America.  That's why I've come from Washington to thank you.
God bless you all.

<title>Classical Education</title>
<body>

<h2>CLASSICAL EDUCATION</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by<br>
Fritz Hinrichs
<p>
This text is adapted from a speech given by Fritz Hinrichs
at the 1995 Homeschool Curriculum fair in San Diego, Calif.</i></center>
<p>
This talk will address two questions: what is Classical Education
and why is it necessary in our day.
<p>
The word &quot;classical&quot; or &quot;classic&quot; is used
in many contexts and often without specific meaning: Classic Coke,
classical music, classic rock.  However, classical usually means
something that through time has proven worthy of our respect and
interest.  In music, the work of certain composers has been recognized
as worth saving, while that of others, though popular in its own
time, has been tossed aside into the dust-bin of history.  The
same is true of books.  Some books are more worthy of study than
others because of the profundity and clarity with which they express
the ideas they contain.
<p>
The study of the great books has been the backbone of good education
for centuries.  If you look at the books read by the intellectual
giants in our culture, you find that particular books come up
again and again.  These books were required of most schoolboys
until the rise of Dewey and the democratization of education through
the public school system in the first half of the 20th century.
 The public school system saw these books as elitist and not easily
comprehensible by the masses and, therefore, not appropriate for
public education.
<p>
Another influence contributing to the demise of the great books
was the demoralization of the Christian intellectual community.
 Most of the institutions of learning in this country were founded
by Christians who saw it as their duty to conquer the intellectual
arena for Christ.  However, since the rise of secularism and,
especially, since the humiliating defeat that biblical Christians
suffered at the Scopes Trial, the evangelical community has been
in full retreat from the intellectual arena.  Before the turn
of the century, most institutions of learning were dominated by
those who thought from a Biblical worldview.  This consensus,
however, soon began to crumble.  In the 1925 Scopes Trial, the
public humiliation of William Jennings Bryan's creationism caused
academia, as well as the general culture, to hold biblical Christianity
as unworthy of intellectual regard.  Even though the trial was
in no way a rigorous debate of the creation issue, its effect
on the Christian intellectual community was nothing 
short of disastrous.  From that point on, Christians felt as though
the intellectual elite had humiliated them, and, in return, they
abandoned the intellectual community in droves.  The intellectual
pursuit came to be seen as not only of little value for Christians,
but also as simply antagonistic to the faith.  At this point in
history the church saw an unraveling of the Christian intellectual
tradition.  No longer would Christians apply themselves to the
study of the great thinkers; that would be a task left entirely
to those with a non-Christian world view.
<p>
Christian education has become something of a lost science.  Not
only have Christians done very little to prepare their children
to become godly intellects, but intellectual incompetence has
been seen as the true helpmate of vital spirituality.  A soft
mind has been considered a vital tool in the pursuit of a soft
heart.  In our day, mental rigor and a vigorous intellectual pursuit
are often equated with doctrinal rigidity and cold spirituality.
<p>
However, by God's grace, with the increasing interest in classical
education, we are seeing a revival of the Christian intellectual
tradition.  Classical education differs from most educational
philosophies in that it attempts to step back from the parade
of pedagogical fads that seem to keep us in a state of continual
bewilderment and asks:  &quot;What was education like in the past?
 What books were used?  What goals were thought important?&quot;
<p>
Dorothy Sayers, in her well-known essay &quot;The Lost Tools of
Learning,&quot; attempted to answer these questions and, in so
doing, gave us some very sage advice for education in our own
day.  She began by investigating the medieval model of education
and found that it was composed of two parts.  The first was called
the Trivium and the second, the Quadrivium.
<p>
The Trivium contains three areas:  Grammar, Dialectic, and Rhetoric.
 Each of these three areas suits to a specific stage of a child's
mental development.   During his early years, a child studies
the Grammar portion of the Trivium.  The Grammar period (ages
9-11) is based on memorization and the acquisition of foundational
facts.  During their younger years, children possess a great natural
ability to memorize large amounts of material even though they
may not understand its significance.  This is the time to fill
them full of facts:  multiplication tables, geography, dates,
events, plant and animal classifications-- anything that lends
itself to easy repetition and assimilation by the mind.  The Grammar
stage lends itself to the study of language, especially an ancient
language such as Latin or Greek, which requires much memorization
of grammatical structures.
<p>
During the second period, the Dialectic (ages 12-14), the child's
greater reasoning ability prompts him to ask questions based on
the information gathered in the Grammar stage.  The child no longer
sees the facts he has learned as merely separate pieces of information.
 Through questioning, he begins to develop logical relationships
between facts.  The American Revolution is no longer a mere fact
in history; it must be understood in light of the child's whole
scope of knowledge.  For example, how are the actions of the American
revolutionaries to be understood in relation to our responsibility
to obey the governing authorities?  How can the fact that Washington
and Jefferson are both held up as great men be reconciled with
the fact that they were slave-holders?
<p>
When a child comes to the age of ability to reason, he frequently
uses his reason to make a nuisance of himself by back-talking
to his parents or trying to catch them in some error or fallacy.
 This sometimes irritating new ability of the young mind should
be directed towards profitable mental exercises.  The study of
formal logic can aid greatly because it teaches the student the
rules that guide sound thinking.  Many subject areas provide good
practice material for the young mind.  Historical events often
pose questions of morality requiring a good deal of discussion
and careful reasoning.  Theology also gives many opportunities
for debate.  Though our discussion must be seasoned with reverence
for the subject matter as well as for our opponents, fundamentally
we can see theological debate as a very healthy and beneficial
activity.  A less controversial but equally powerful tool for
cultivating logic is the study of mathematics.  For thousands
of years the geometry text written by the ancient Greek mathematician
Euclid has provided a beautifully constructed series of geometrical
proofs that, with guidance, any perceptive child can work through
with great benefit to his or her thinking skills.
<p>
The third period Dorothy Sayers mentions is that of Rhetoric (ages
14-16).  At this age, the child moves from merely grasping the
logical sequence of arguments to learning how to present them
in a persuasive, aesthetically pleasing form.  Sayers also calls
this the Poetic age, because expression becomes as important as
logical content.  During this period the student can begin to
study areas of interest in greater depth in preparation for the
Quadrivium, in which students specialize in particular areas of
study.  In the Rhetoric period, students more inclined towards
either mathematics and science or literature and the humanities
can pursue the area of their natural abilities.  The pursuit of
particular subjects is appropriate at this stage because a student
who had been given a classical education would have the thinking
skills and mental discipline and other tools of learning necessary
to tackle the difficulties associated with almost any area of
study.
<p>
In modern education, we have put the proverbial cart before the
horse by expecting students to master a great number of subjects
before they have mastered the tools of learning.  Even though
the study of language and logic may seem dull in themselves, they
equip a student with the tools needed for mastering any particular
subject, whether it be Scottish political history or carburetor
maintenance.  As Sayers states in the conclusion of her essay,
&quot;The sole true end of education is simply this:  to teach
men how to learn for themselves; and whatever instruction fails
to do this is effort spent in vain.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Learning to learn for oneself&quot; certainly well summarizes
the pedagogical goal of classical education; however, once equipped
with the ability to learn, where shall one go from there?  Another
truism is helpful here:  &quot;Education is merely selling someone
on books.&quot;  To be able to learn for yourself does not mean
that you no longer need a teacher, but rather that you are capable
of making books your teachers without the aid of an instructor
to explain the books to you.  In our day and age we seem to be
quite impressed by the number of years one has spent in the academic
institutions obtaining degrees.  The ancients, however, would
probably have thought our institutions must be quite poor since
they rarely produce students who are able to learn independently.
 That a student still needs an instructor to explain the works
he is reading shows a sad level of intellectual dependency.  We
seem to think that intellectual adolescence must be indefinitely
prolonged before granting a young scholar the right to stand on
his own two feet.  The fact that you leave the academic institution
should not be a sign that your education has come to an end, rather
it should show that you are ready for it to begin.
<p>
If we ask, &quot;Which books are worthy teachers?&quot;,  the
answer usually depends on what we are attempting to learn.  If,
however, the question is, &quot;Which are the truly great books?&quot;,
we find there is actually fairly broad agreement.  There are books
that through history have shown enduring value.  With the Bible
we have a canon comprised of those books that God, through his
Spirit, has directed the Church to acknowledge as authoritative;
so also with the great books there is a canon of sorts.  Through
time certain books have generally come to be viewed as central
to the development of western culture and have had an unusually
large impact due to the profundity and eloquence with which they
have expressed their ideas.  These books form the core of the
western intellectual tradition; it is the ideas contained in them
that have formed the saga known as western history.
<p>
Anyone who has grown up in the West and desires to understand
the cultural milieu in which they have been raised should read
these books.  In order to come to a self-conscious understanding
of the ideas that have shaped the culture around us, we need to
face the ideas at the source from which they came.  Francis Schaeffer
had an excellent sense for the top-down flow of ideas.  He was
fond of explaining  how ideas began with the philosophers, worked
down through the universities, into the popular media and finally
into the general culture.  Because ideas progress in this manner,
it behooves us to become acquainted with ideas at their fount
so that we may understand their manifestations in our present
culture.  Thus, the reading of the great books serves an important
apologetic function for Christians.
<p>
When I describe the study of the great books as a tool in apologetics,
people often visualize their study as something of a brutal secular
gauntlet the Christian must run in order to gain intellectual
credibility.  This is a mistaken understanding.  Certainly there
is much in the western intellectual tradition that must be consciously
rejected and put under biblical criticism, but it is the non-believer
and not the Christian who must fear the reading of the great books.
 Those who through the promotion of political correctness would
return us to polytheistic paganism have come to realize that they
must entirely throw out the study of western culture if they are
going to reshape the thinking of our students.  Western thought
has been permeated with Christian monotheism and, thus, a persistent
concept of objective and universal truth, so it will always be
dangerous territory for the mental slugs that political correctness
would raise up on its diet of insipid relativism. 
<p>
Certainly the study of the great books should not be taken lightly.
 There are serious hazards to one's faith that lurk, but studying
through the great books often is like the trouble-filled journey
of Christian in <I>Pilgrim's Progress</I>.  Just about the time
that you think all is lost and that the darkness is certainly
coming in around and you feel that you will surely be done in,
an author who is a friend of the Faith comes to your side and
helps guide you back to the path of truth.  For every Aristotle,
there is an Augustine; when you are in the throes of a skeptical
Descartes, the brilliant faith of Pascal comes to your aid; when
under attack by Hume, you have a friend in Calvin; when besieged
by Kant, you fight back with Lewis.  God in his providential care
has given us a bountiful number of voices who have stood in the
gap at crucial periods of our history and spoken for His truth.
 The men God has raised up to speak His truth to our culture are
a testimony to the tremendous care with which He has guided the
West.
<p>
We live in the continuum of western history.  In order to evaluate
this stream of which we are a part, we must step back from it
and discern the ideas that have shaped it.  To attempt to ignore
the ideas that have shaped our cultural history is to guarantee
ourselves not only cultural irrelevance but also entrenchment
in the Christian ghetto.  This position not only will lead to
our own intellectual poverty but also will disgrace the Sovereign
God who needs not be mocked by the cowardice of His children.
 The King's children do not hide in the alleys but walk confidently
knowing that the sun that shines belongs to their Father.

<title>HEARING ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2>HEARING ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY</h2>
<h4>Testimony of Cathleen A. Cleaver, Esq.<br>
Director of Legal Studies, Family Research Council<br>
before the<br>
Committee on the Judiciary<br>
of the<br>
United States Senate<br>
October 25, 1995</h4></center>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I am the Director of
Legal Studies for the Family Research Council, a non-profit research
and advocacy organization, established to defend family, faith,
and freedom.  On behalf of Gary Bauer and the Family Research
Council, I want to express our sincere appreciation for the opportunity
to address this distinguished Committee on the critical issue
of religious liberty.
<p>
The First Amendment is not internally inconsistent.  The Establishment
Clause[1] was designed to prevent the State from coercing a religious
belief. The Free Exercise Clause[2] was designed to prevent the
State from interfering with the exercise of religious beliefs.
Thus, the religion clauses were designed to work hand-in-hand
to promote government neutrality with regard to religion.
<p>
In the last several decades, however, the Supreme Court has wrongly
interpreted the clauses to be antagonistic to each other.  The
Court has created a false conflict between the religion clauses
which must be reconciled in each case, and the Establishment Clause
prohibition has been the usual victor.  &quot;The government cannot
avoid aiding religion unless it actively opposes religion,&quot;
the argument goes.  More often than not, discrimination against
citizens or groups with religious viewpoints has become the only
constitutionally &quot;safe&quot; resolution to this false conflict.
Insistence on avoiding appearances of endorsement of or incidental
aid to religion has worked to inhibit the free exercise of religion.
Complementary clauses read to be inconsistent could not but 
result in inconsistent rulings.  The current &quot;chaos&quot;
in the federal courts in this area, therefore, is distressing,
but not surprising.
<p>
On October 20th, this Committee heard testimony from a distinguished
panel of experts who discussed the history of interpretation errors
in First Amendment religion clause jurisprudence, and efforts
to correct those errors by various federal statutes.  I will not
repeat this testimony, nor will I refute the argument that nothing
need be done, for the acceptability of that position is increasingly
waning.[3]
<p>
I will, instead, attempt to explain our preference for a constitutional
amendment rather than a federal statute, and address specific
concerns which have been raised in the public debate. 
<p>
The Family Research Council supports an amendment to the constitution
clarifying the First Amendment's prohibition of discrimination
against religious expression, and against persons, groups, or
organizations in access to government benefits or protections
on account of the religious character of their speech or identity.
We do not favor changing the First Amendment in any way.  Rather,
we support an amendment which would correct the Supreme Court's
misinterpretation of the First Amendment.
<p>
Several concerns and questions have been raised about the amendment
approach and its ramifications.
<p>
<B>1. Is such a radical approach really necessary?</B>  First,
it is wise to keep from confusing <I>procedure</I> with <I>substance.</I>
Amending the constitution is a radical procedure, to be sure.
Article V of the Constitution ensures that it is not to be achieved
without effort and consensus.  Yet, the substance of a restorative
religious liberty amendment need not be radical in nature.  Legal
experts and numerous interested groups have examined potential
approaches for months, and the Family Research Council remains
willing to continue to discuss specific language for the amendment.
We are especially eager to hear your specific ideas, Mr. Chairman,
and those of Congressman Hyde. For purposes of discussion this
morning, I will center my comments on the draft proposal garnering
considerable support, and presented to this Committee at the October
20th hearing:[4]
<p><blockquote>
<b>In order to secure the unalienable right of the people to
acknowledge, worship, and serve their Creator, neither the United
States nor any State shall deny benefits to or otherwise discriminate
against any persons, acting in a private capacity, on account
of their religious expression, belief, or identity; and the exercise
by such persons of freedom of religion, speech, press, or association
shall not be construed as an establishment of religion.</b>
</blockquote><p>
This language would, in effect, say to government, &quot;do not
discriminate against persons on account of their religious beliefs,&quot;
and to the Supreme Court, &quot;do not construe this non-discriminatory
treatment to be a governmental establishment of religion.&quot;
The fact that some civil liberties groups call the Amendment
extreme does not make it so.  It is a negative mandate upon government:
do not discriminate and do not misconstrue.  It bestows no new
rights, it apportions no new responsibilities.  Far from &quot;injecting
the federal government into the situation&quot; as some critics
perceive, the Religious Liberty Amendment  protects religious
liberty by ensuring government neutrality toward religion.  The
Amendment is not radical in substance.  Indeed, it is nothing
more than an embodiment of First Amendment principles properly
understood.
<p>
<B>2.  If it is not radical, why is it necessary?</B>  It is necessary
to correct serious misinterpretations of a Constitution provision.
 It is restorative, not creative.  The amendment process is an
appropriate means of clarifying the Constitution of the People.
Several constitutional amendments have been in the nature of clarifications,
especially the voting rights amendments.
<p>
<B>3.  Some suggest that the Court is coming around on its own,
obviating the need for an amendment</B>. <i>Rosenberger v. University
of Virginia</i> is generally cited here.[5] <i>Rosenberger</i>,
however, like other 5-4 decisions with multiple opinions, is a
very fact-dependent decision.  In reversing the University of
Virginia's decision to withhold student activity funds for a Christian
student magazine, Justice Kennedy found it important that Wide
Awake Productions, the publisher, was not a &quot;religious organization&quot;
and that the funds would go to a printing company rather than
directly to the student publication.[6] Moreover, Justice O'Connor
warned in her concurrence that <i>Rosenberger</i> is not meant
to establish any bright-line test.[7] Despite its disclaimers and
reservations, <i>Rosenberger</i> was a good result, yet there
is simply no reason to conclude that <i>Rosenberger</i> signals
a new consistency in religion clause jurisprudence.  Indeed, Justice
Souter in his dissent went so far as to say that neutrality toward
religion is not required by the First Amendment.  It could be
years before another religious discrimination case of this kind
is taken up by the high court.  In the meantime, some Americans'
precious First Amendment rights are held in abeyance, the deprivation
of which is an irreparable harm.
<p>
<B>4.  Will a Religious Liberty Amendment prevent any future misconstruction
of the Religion Clauses?</B>  No.  And it is, of course,  possible
that the Amendment itself will be misconstrued.  Any assertion
to the contrary would be disingenuous.  But to concede these points
does not then force a concession that the Amendment will be futile
or meaningless.  The Supreme Court made a wrong turn in 1947 in
<i>Everson v. Board of Education</i>;[8] momentum and the weighty principle of 
<I>stare decisis</I>[9] have worked against the Court's righting itself.
Even considering the possibility of misinterpretation, an amendment
would dislodge the Court from its faulty construction of internal
inconsistency in the First Amendment.
<p>
<B>5. Will the Amendment create a new entitlement program for
church-related programs or schools?</B>  No. Government has no
obligation to provide funds to private schools, for example. 
Yet, if government should decide to do so, a Religious Liberty
Amendment would prevent the government from discriminating in
favor of private secular schools and against private parochial
schools.[10] The Amendment would <I>permit</I> government to fund
secular classes in religious schools, but would not <I>require</I>
government to fund such classes.   Religious activities would
not be funded by the government -- the Amendment would not eradicate
the Establishment Clause, after all -- but activities conducted
in religious settings or by religious people could be funded,
if such activities were within the purview of the secular government
funding program.  The &quot;pervasively sectarian&quot; or &quot;pervasively
religious&quot; analysis would be abandoned.
<p>
<B>6. Would an Amendment allow teacher-led prayer?</B> No. 
The Amendment would ensure that persons in their private capacity
would be free from discrimination, but government employees, including
teachers, would be subject to the restrictions of the Establishment
Clause when acting in their official capacity, such as when teaching.
<p>
<B>7. Why not seek a statutory remedy?</B>  A federal statute
could ultimately be futile.  While such a statute would initially
resolve inconsistencies from state to state,[11] the Supreme Court
would remain the final arbiter of the Constitution.  A federal
statute would not prevent judges from continuing to misconstrue
the First Amendment.  While a statute might survive a facial challenge,
an &quot;as applied&quot; challenge would quite possibly be adjudged
unconstitutional under current precedent.  A statutory &quot;solution&quot;
would be a hollow victory, if, at the end of the day, the substantial
efforts to draft, enact, and defend a statute were swiftly abolished
by one Supreme Court opinion.  When the roof is leaking, repair
the roof -- don't buy more buckets.
<p>
The Religious Liberty Amendment could be thought of as the religious
&quot;neutrality&quot; amendment.  This principle of neutrality
is not new -- it is the aim and result of our First Amendment's
religion clauses properly understood.  A Religious Liberty Amendment
could restore this saving principle, so that our First Amendment
would not be used to promote the empty state religion of secularism, but to 
promote true freedom, and the prospect of freedom's fulfillment in truth, 
to which every American is entitled.

<title>THE LEGACY OF THE NEW JERSEY FAMILY CAP</title>

<h2>THE LEGACY OF THE NEW JERSEY<br>
FAMILY CAP:</h2>
<h4>A BLUEPRINT FOR THE STATES</h4></center>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<center><i>by<br>
Jennifer E. Marshall</i></center>
<p>
When the states begin to reassess welfare policy in the wake of
new federal legislation, the defining issue will be the family
cap.  A well-rounded debate over the family cap will ask and answer
fundamental questions about the future of social policy in a post-entitlement
world -- and few questions beg right answers quite so urgently.
<p>
A modest first step, the family cap would simply deny an increase
in the AFDC cash benefits to mothers who bear additional children
while on welfare.  The &quot;restriction&quot; is scant in proportion
to the scale of devastation wrought by open-ended checks.
<p>
In many instances, those checks have reduced the birth father
to no more than a passing stranger, and marriage is teetering
on the brink of anachronism in communities with a high concentration
of welfare recipients.  To the extent that the state provides
ready alternatives, marriage, work, and self-sufficiency will
inevitably seem a little less hallowed, a little less than necessary.
<p>
The purpose of the family cap is, not to reduce births per se,
but to restore a sense of personal responsibility by insisting
that families on welfare live by the same values and confront
exactly the same choices as the general population.  The working
poor, for example, receive no increase in salary when another
child is added to the family.  Lowering our expectations of a
woman on welfare and the father of her child is no different from
lowering our estimation of their capability -- implying that they
are a different, less human kind of breed than the rest of us
who can and do live by the rules.
<p>
In his 1988 book <I>In Pursuit of Happiness and Good Government</I>,
Charles Murray argues that self-respect is an essential human
need and that the threshold condition for self-respect is accepting
responsibility for one's own life.  Self-determination must be
authentic, however.  An &quot;as if&quot; condition does not suffice.
Thus, Murray concludes, &quot;self-respect is not within the gift of any 
government or any policy. . . .  The only thing that government can do is
provide an environment within which people can earn their self-respect&quot;[1]
by earning their own way in the world.  If children are suffering
because parents are irresponsible, no amount of government money
can allay the suffering -- because the parents will still be irresponsible.
<p>
But Murray also defines self-respect as &quot;measuring up to
internalized standards of what it means to be a full-fledged member
of the community.&quot;[2] Government policy that dumbs down the
standards for welfare recipients so that &quot;measuring up&quot;
no longer has any content, or makes any economic sense, does violence
to the human spirit.  It's also singularly unjust.  Women on welfare
should have equal opportunity to follow the playbook that for
centuries has been the surest guarantor of human happiness.  What
Edmund Burke wrote long ago is even more true today: &quot;We
know that we have made no discoveries, and we think that no discoveries
are to be made, in morality.&quot;  Yet, we perpetuate a welfare
system that makes it harder for men and women to pursue virtuous
living.
<p>
Arguments against the current system rest not on value premises
exclusively but on empirical fact, confirmed by social science
data, that adult satisfaction depends on earning one's own way
and that children's well-being depends critically on a stable
family life.[3]  A proper concept of justice places a premium, not
on securing any particular material result, but on upholding the
social agreement that men and women work for their bread and wait
to bear children until they are emotionally and financially able
to provide for their support.  Certainly, we should question the
justice of requiring working men and women to uphold the rules
while spending their hard-earned tax dollars to subsidize the
systematic violation of those rules.
<p>
The central problem with the welfare system is that it deranges
social expectations regarding work and marriage by turning nature's
rewards and penalties on end.  Asserting that everyone possesses
moral autonomy is not the same as asserting that everyone possesses
equal capacity to sort through the mixed signals of a policy that
obliterates natural consequences and denies virtue its full reward
by making crimes against the social compact pay.
<p>
Again, however, the argument for the family cap rests, not on
value premises alone, but on certain assumptions about human nature
and social causation that are empirically verifiable.  And the
most recent data from New Jersey's experiment with the family
cap provide powerful evidence that proponents of the cap are indeed
correct in their assumptions.
<p>
In the sixteen months after the family cap took effect in August
of 1993, the average monthly birth rate for women on AFDC in New
Jersey declined by 10 percent or more -- a durable, sizable, and
real reduction in the birth rate.[4] When the denominator is restricted
to women of childbearing age (15-45 years old), whose youngest
child is at least 10 months old and who have been on AFDC for
at least 12 months, the reported birth rate decreased by 17.6
percent over the 12-month period immediately following implementation
of the Family Development Program (FDP).[5]
<p>
While the time series data is significant, the most interesting
piece of evidence to date surfaced in a memo leaked to the press
from the formal evaluation study at Rutgers University.  According
to the memo, the Rutgers study has found no significant difference
in the rate of births to women in the &quot;experimental&quot;
group, who are subject to the restriction on additional cash benefits,
and women in the &quot;control&quot; group, who are exempt from
the cash limitation.
<p>
<b>Contrary to press reports, the null difference between the
experimental and control birth rates does NOT imply that the cap
has had no impact on births to AFDC women.  The correct explanation
for the null difference is that births dropped within both groups
after the new policy took effect.  The family cap, in other words,
has had an even larger and more dramatic impact on births than
expected.[6]</b>
<p>
Explaining the scope of that effect is an exercise in charting
a much broader agenda for political and cultural reform.  While
the family cap is no panacea, it is a critical first step that
logically implies both the destination desired and the reforms
that will be required -- to renew the ethic of individual responsibility
and personal compassion that will restore moral authority to the
Founders' notion of liberty.  The logic of the family cap insists
that relimiting government is itself a moral imperative.
<p>
The most plausible explanation for the success of the New Jersey
cap is that the change in policy sent a clear moral signal that
was at least as important an aspect of the &quot;treatment&quot;
as the restriction on cash benefits.  Dr. Rudy Myers of the New
Jersey Department of Human Services explains:
<p><blockquote>
[T]he treatment in FDP [New Jersey's Family Development Program]
is <I>not </I>a matter of whether or not the AFDC grant is increased
with the birth of the additional child, but is, rather, a matter
of whether or not the individual is exposed to the public publicity
itself -- e.g., newspapers, conversations at the Laundromat, talk
radio, etc.  Suffice it to say that it is extremely implausible
that anyone living in New Jersey for the past several years has
<I>not </I>been exposed to the &quot;family cap&quot; policy.
 &quot;Policy&quot; here cannot be restricted to meaning simply
the law about the family cap; it is the entire line of reasoning
about issues of personal and family responsibility, fairness to
working taxpayers, [and] the rational approach to self-sufficiency.[7]
</blockquote><p>
Because the public discussion of the ideas and values motivating
the law reached women in both the &quot;treatment&quot; and &quot;control&quot;
groups, Dr. Myers concludes that the control group condition cannot
be considered a reasonable proxy for eliminating the effect of
the cap altogether.
<p>
Contrary to liberal rhetoric about the &quot;punitive&quot; nature
of the cap, the success of the New Jersey policy rests on the
power of social persuasion.  The $44 benefit increase eliminated
by the family cap constituted only 4 percent of the total monthly
welfare benefits received by the average AFDC mother in New Jersey.[8]
Those who cry &quot;social engineering&quot; should bear in mind
that the cash limitation itself merely restores government neutrality
after a long interlude of active government favoritism to out-of-wedlock births. 
Women are free to bear as many children as they wish, at their own expense. 
A law with as modest an economic disincentive as the New Jersey
cap almost certainly derives its force from new moral sanctions
against illegitimate childbearing and other personal failings.
<p>
Critics of the cap now question whether a public relations campaign
promoting personal responsibility could be sufficiently forceful
to obviate the need for changes in current welfare policy.  Those
critics forget that laws are indeed moral signaling devices, that
policies cannot belie principles, and that governments cannot
instill a sense of responsibility <I>and </I>provide material
support at the same time.  A public relations campaign is not
sufficient precisely because welfare obviates the need for personal
responsibility and because the &quot;as if&quot; condition, Charles
Murray discovers, does not hold.
<p>
The family cap may be less important than the shift in social
norms that it reflects, but it is a prerequisite for real reform
because it reconciles the current tension between moral knowledge
and the perverse economic incentives of welfare.  The family cap
is an indictment, not of welfare recipients, but of the welfare
system itself.  Illegitimacy, for example, used to be controlled
in large part by the natural economic consequences, until the
economics of welfare intervened to blunt the effect.  Policymakers
will find it impossible to reaffirm a family's ability to meet
their own needs, or even to insist that parenting is a fundamental
and enduring responsibility, without reversing the economic signals
that have sent the opposite message for the last 30 years.  Economic
disincentives to virtue ultimately derange social expectations
so that morality itself no longer has meaning.
<p>
While the family cap will be a necessary first step, by no means
will it prove sufficient to reverse the damage.  Policymakers
should move quickly to terminate cash benefits to unwed minor
mothers and to provide a refundable tax credit to married couples
with children when at least one spouse is employed.  Both policy
recommendations address powerful economic disincentives to marriage
left intact by an exclusive focus on the family cap.  Proactive
measures to encourage family formation, like a tax credit for
adoption expenses, are strongly advisable as well.
<p>
Yet, New Jersey's experiment with the cap demonstrates that the
solution cannot rest entirely with the welfare system or with
new legislation.  Even with the family cap in place, yielding
surprisingly strong results, roughly 10 percent of the state's
unwed welfare mothers continue to bear children each year.[9] If
the family cap derives its power from a larger cultural context,
publicizing the moral reasoning behind the change in law, clearly
all institutions in the community must redouble their efforts
to send strong, unequivocal messages advocating personal and parental
responsibility.
<p>
Perhaps the most compelling argument for the cap is that it is
a symbolic first attempt to begin scaling back the government
programs that have eroded the strength of character-forming institutions
-- the family, the church, the school -- by negating their function.
 An astute Frenchman by the name of Tocqueville identified the
fatal error in policies that seek to take the trouble out of living by 
supplanting voluntary arrangements. &quot;The power of the state,&quot; 
he wrote, &quot;would resemble parental authority if, fatherlike, it tried to 
prepare its charges for a man's life, but on the contrary, it only tries to keep 
them in perpetual childhood.&quot;
<p>
It is time to acknowledge that public policy can undermine, but
never instill, virtue and that restoring the concept of responsibility
implies new obligations, not only for welfare recipients, 
but for members of the middle and upper classes too.  Unless neighbors
are once again moved to trouble over each other, the behavioral
poverty of the underclass will only continue to grow more acute,
jeopardizing personal freedoms and ultimately the survival of
the republic itself.  Children must grow to appreciate what is
great and good in order to make good use of liberty; and even
parents depend on the interplay of thoughtful neighbors to help
pattern right habits of the heart.
<p>
Politicians, for their part, can create the enabling conditions
that foster strong families and communities.  And in addition
to cutting government programs, policymakers should revise the
tax code to encourage charitable giving.  States should also consider
designing executive measures like the Faith and Families program
Governor Fordice has implemented in Mississippi to help speed
the replacement of state solutions by strong civil institutions.[10]
<p>
Ultimately, however, politicians will be dependent on the quiet
saints who man soup kitchens and staff maternity homes to inspire
moral renewal in our land -- to teach man to defend liberty more
for the love of virtue and charity than as a claim of  right or
an end in itself.
<p>
The fate of our experiment with self-government will depend upon
our ability to renew a sense of responsibility across all income
classes, along with a renewed commitment to our Founding Fathers'
faith that all men are created equal to live up to those responsibilities.
<p>
At stake is the future of freedom, but also morality, community,
and family -- all of which depend critically on the preservation
of liberty.  Living in the afterglow of new federal welfare legislation
that has ended the entitlement status of welfare, we would do
well to remember that freedom itself <i>is</i> an entitlement
owed every man by virtue of his birth.

<h2>HOW SOCIAL SECURITY<br>
AFFECTS THE TAX REFORM<br>
DEBATE</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by<br>
William R. Mattox, Jr.</center>
<p>
This speech was given at the Heritage Foundation Resource Bank
Meeting on April 27, 1995 in Philadelphia, Pa.</i>
<p>
This morning's topic is going on the offensive and in thinking
about the range of ideas one could talk about, I was struck by
how many opportunities we now have before us -- and how many of
these ideas would not have even been worthy of discussion just
a short time ago.
<p>
Indeed, today everything is on the table -- except Social Security,
which is why I'd like to devote most of my remarks this morning
to Social Security.  Now, I'm not going to advance any new ideas
about Social Security reform.  I'm not even going to talk about
Social Security directly.
<p>
Instead, I'm going to talk about why anti-family biases inherent
in the Social Security system <b>must</b> be taken into consideration
when we seek to legislate in other areas -- most especially in
pursuing a conservative tax cut agenda.  As you know, the House
recently passed the American Dream Restoration Act -- the crown
jewel of the Contract with America.
<p>
The centerpiece of this measure is a $500 tax credit for children.
Within the conservative movement, there are three views of this
pro-family tax cut:
<p>
1. <b>Social issues conservatives</b> love it and often make
a case for it by citing the extraordinary erosion in per-child
tax benefits since 1950.
<p>
2. <b>Deficit hawks</b> hate it.  They perceive it to be a revenue
drain and claim Americans don't want tax cuts as much as they
want deficit reduction.  This is a questionable proposition, but
even if true, there is nothing that says you can't do both.
<p>
3. <b>Supply-siders</b> are torn about pro-family tax relief.
 On the one hand, most agree with Milton Friedman who says he
has never seen a tax cut he didn't like; and most appreciate the
political argument that pro-family tax relief can enhance the chances 
of passing capital gains cuts and cuts in spending programs.  On the 
other hand, most supply siders see no short-term payoff in terms of 
economic growth -- and for this reason, many want to do the least 
amount necessary to secure pro-family votes.
<p>
Now, I share the supply-siders' interest in growth, but I believe
there is a very compelling economic argument for making pro-family tax relief
our top tax-cut priority.  Allan Carlson of the Rockford Institute
has argued that the Social Security system robs parents of the
social insurance value of their children.  That is, if there were
no old-age social insurance scheme, adults in our society would
have an economic incentive to invest a portion of their time and
money in the rearing of children in order to protect themselves
against the prospect of being destitute in old age.
<p>
Now, Carlson is not suggesting that childrearing is the only means
of protecting oneself against poverty in old age.  Certainly,
one can and should save for such purposes.  Nor is Carlson suggesting
that this economic incentive is, or ever should be, the primary
motivation for raising children.  Certainly, moral imperatives
are, or should be, far more significant factors.  But Carlson
believes moral principles and economic forces should work in harmony.
Yet, in our current system, moral and economic forces are in
conflict.  In our current system, it is economically foolish to
invest in childrearing, for under Social Security productive adults
can live it up today on the resources that might otherwise be
diverted to childrearing and live it up tomorrow on the resources
Social Security takes from other people's adult children and gives
to them.
<p>
This bias calls for fundamental reform of the Social Security
system.  But if such reform cannot even be discussed, then it
is incumbent upon us to offset these anti-family effects through
some other means -- the most logical being per-child tax savings.
 How much in per-child tax savings would be necessary to neutralize
the Social Security system's anti-child bias?  By my calculations,
$2,100 -- and I'll be happy to explain later how I arrived at
that figure if anyone wants to know.
<p>
When one considers that most children offer their parents less
than $400 in tax savings, you can appreciate why some of us pro-family
yahoos hardly regard $500 in addition tax savings as excessive.
Not only does Social Security indirectly discourage people from
having children, but it indirectly discourages them from raising
kids well.  Indeed, under the current system, workaholics who
neglect their childrearing responsibilities do not stand to suffer
economically if their kids grow up to be dolts or sloths (so long
as everybody else's kids can produce enough to keep the
Social Security system afloat).  But in a natural economy free
of old-age entitlements, neglectful parents would stand to lose
much.
<p>
To offset Social Security's bias against investments of parental
time and attention, Carlson argues that we not only need an income
tax -- but a progressive one at that.  A progressive income tax,
he argues, has the effect of causing parents at some point to
shift their attention from paid work to the unpaid work of raising children.
Now, I have little reason to believe that Carlson's enthusiasm
for a progressive income tax is widely shared by many here.
<p>
But lest one think his view represents a threat to the <b>adoption</b>
of a flat tax, it should be noted that, for all practical purposes,
we already have a flat tax.  That's right, when one <b>combines</b>
current income tax rates with current Social Security tax rates,
nearly all taxpayers have a marginal tax rate of roughly 30 percent.
Crudely speaking, for those making below $60,000, this rate is
divided almost equally between a 15 percent income tax rate and
a 15 percent payroll tax.  For most of those making over $60,000,
this 30 percent is derived from a 28 percent income tax rate and
a 2 percent Medicare tax.  While this is a reality that all of
the leading &quot;flat tax&quot; plans currently ignore, it is
a reality that need not threaten many of the appealing features
of such plans -- features like eliminating tax withholding, simplifying
tax forms, and getting rid of many tax write-offs and deductions.
<p>
One tax deduction that ought not to be scrapped, however, is the
charitable deduction.  From the standpoint of economic theory,
I do not know whether there is a compelling reason for preserving
the charitable deduction.  I suspect there is -- but it really
doesn't matter, because the short-run political argument for preserving
the charitable tax deduction is so powerful that no other argument
is perhaps necessary.  If one of our major goals is, as it should
be, dismantling the welfare state, then I think we should recognize
that few Americans are likely to view as credible any agenda which
simultaneously seeks to gut public housing and to eliminate tax
incentives for giving to Habitat for Humanity.  If you think the
public drubbing conservatives took on school lunch was bad, wait
until you see what the Left would do with that.
<p>
Unless we are more troubled by charitable tax deductions than
AFDC and public housing, I think we should steer clear of any
tax simplification plan that eliminates charitable contributions.
Indeed, if we truly want to dismantle the welfare state, I think
we ought to be looking at ways to expand charitable deductions
to non-itemizers as well as ways to permit taxpayers to divert
a portion of their tax liability to a charitable cause of their
choosing.
<p>
Having devoted most of my speech to the indirect effect of Social
Security on various tax issues, I want to close my remarks by
talking about restoring the social institution that provides greater
security -- yes, greater social security -- than any other.  It's
the institution of marriage.  And it is in serious shape.
<p>
My friends, no proactive idea being talked about at this conference
is likely to prevent the eventual collapse of our civilization
unless we see a restoration of lifelong marriage.  While the factors
influencing family breakdown are primarily moral or cultural,
there are at least a few policy ideas worth exploring in these
arenas.
<p>
<i>At the state and local level, we need to be:</i>
<ul><p>
<li>Advancing divorce reform initiatives which require fault to
be established in cases where one spouse wishes to contest the
divorce.  (Current law now favors the spouse wanting to leave
the marriage rather than the one wishing to save the marriage.)
<p>
<li>Advancing tough anti-illegitimacy measures in the context
of welfare reform.
<p>
<li>Promoting abstinence-based programs in schools where sex education
is taught.
<p></ul>
<i>At the federal level we need to:</i>
<ul><p>
<li>Eliminate the Legal Services Corporation, which finances some
300,000 divorces a year.
<p>
<li>Address the perplexing problem of the tax treatment of marriage
in a manner that helps all married couples -- perhaps with a tax
provision tied not just to marital status, but to marital length.
 By extending larger tax benefits with each year a couple stays
together, the tax code could pass along the societal savings of
marital stability to those who have avoided divorce the longest.
</ul><p>
While it is important for us to recognize the virtues of these
pro-family policy reforms, it is also important for us to recognize
the limitations of all policy instruments.  Pro-family tax relief,
for example, will not make husbands love their wives or children
respect their parents.  It will not clean up filthy T.V. or remove
child predators from our streets.  Pro-family tax relief will
not, by itself, magically solve the various social problems facing
America's families, neighborhoods and communities.
<p>
But pro-family tax relief will make it easier for families to
thrive by reducing economic stress.  It will make it easier for
parents to monitor their children's T.V. viewing habits by freeing
them to spend more time with their children.  It will empower
parents to address many family needs that only they can meet.
<p>
This is why pro-family tax relief is so critical -- and why all
parts of the conservative movement ought to embrace it enthusiastically.

This speech was the keynote address at the Lutherans for Life
National Convention on November 3, 1995 in Chicago, Illinois.</i>
<p>
People in Washington have particular trouble, it seems, with words
that communicate the things we feel most deeply. We are currently
involved in a great controversy with one of our best friends.
Bill Bennett is a man I've honored and worked for. He has written
letters to Dr. James Dobson and conservative activist Paul Weyrich
taking sharp issue with them over the question of abortion.
<p>
Bennett is a wise man, a man of great learning and experience.
When he speaks, it pays to listen.  In speaking of abortion, Bennett
asks if it would not be better to support a candidate for president
who would actually speak out <I>against</I> abortion, a man who
would support teen abstinence programs that work, a man who would
champion adoption instead of abortion? Wouldn't such a man help
to lower the terrible toll of one and a half million abortions
a year, even if he remained committed to the continuing legality
of abortion? Wouldn't it be better to back someone of high moral
character, Bennett continues, someone who could mount the &quot;bully
pulpit&quot; of the White House in behalf of culturally conservative
ideals?  Isn't such a man <I>preferable </I>to the man who endorses
what Bennett calls the &quot;chimera&quot; of a human life amendment
while providing only &quot;lip service&quot; to the pro-life cause?
<p>
You must give Bill Bennett credit -- he knows how to pose a dilemma.
He's a thoughtful and provocative writer. I hope you will bear
with me if I take some time tonight to respond to the questions
Bennett poses.
<p>
We should welcome this debate. One of the things that has been
so dispiriting about the abortion debate in this country is the
intellectual dishonesty that attends so much of the discussion.
When the election of 1992 finally ended, columnist Charles Krauthammer
wrote that the abortion debate had been decided.
<p>
Many of us cried out that the abortion <I>debate</I> had never
even been held.  Bennett's message is an enticing one. Who among
us is not tired of the trench warfare we have been fighting for
the past 23 years? Isn't it very tempting to break out of the
exhausting and unproductive rut of &quot;politics as usual?&quot;
<p>
Of <I>course,</I> we seek the lowering of the number of abortions.
We know that one and a half million abortions a year is a tragedy.
But are we likely to take the steps necessary to reduce that terrible
toll if we don't think that <I>one</I> abortion is a crime?  What
we see today is the result of a cynicism by public figures. Stalin
said, &quot;A single death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a
statistic.&quot; Too many of our political leaders pay &quot;lip
service&quot; to the tragedy of abortion, but act as if it is
merely another item in the index of leading cultural indicators.
<p>
Of <I>course, </I>we would like to see a president who wholeheartedly
believes that abortion is wrong and who is willing to speak out
against it. A little history will help. America has never had
a president who thought <I>lynching</I> was nice. Most publicly
deplored it. But it was not until President Eisenhower signed
a civil rights law in 1957 that a president acted effectively
to put a stop to lynching. Would lynching have ended sooner if
Eisenhower had supported the choice of legal lynching while using
the White House to speak up for <I>alternatives to lynching</I>?
Ike and Mamie, culturally conservative as they were, could have
been the poster people for opponents of lynching. But it was <I>President
</I>Eisenhower's willingness to use federal marshals and federal
troops that assured the rule of law in such places as Little Rock,
Arkansas.
<p>
Bennett knows philosophy, so he would recognize Thomas Jefferson's
famous taunt. Mr. Jefferson said that if you put a moral question
to a plowman and a philosopher, the plowman would be more likely
to answer rightly. That's because the man who knows little is
closer to the truth than the man who knows many things that aren't
true.
<p>
One of the main things that isn't true is that we pro-lifers would
somehow <I>prefer</I> a president who gives us lip service instead
of solid and constructive action on a life-saving agenda. We were forced 
to <I>accept</I> such weak leadership: we never <I>asked</I> for it. To 
present us only two alternatives -- the pro-abortion president who, 
in his heart, thinks it should be discouraged and is willing to
say so publicly or the insincere pro-life president who pays mere
lip service to a human life amendment -- is to engage in the logical fallacy 
of the &quot;false dilemma.&quot;
<p>
Few people have given so much to our country as Bill Bennett on
a host of issues. When he was interviewed on Dr. James Dobson's
broadcast several years ago, Bennett gave us many wise insights.
On the troubling questions of gays in the military and women in
combat, no one can top Bennett. He told Dr. Dobson's 
listeners that there is a masculine, martial ideal. That ideal
calls upon men, in obedience to lawful authority, to take up arms in defense 
of the weak, the innocent, the vulnerable in order to restore justice
and peace. Bennett gave us an excellent summary of the &quot;just
war&quot; doctrine so wisely taught by Saint Augustine, and so
well elaborated by Martin Luther. Bennett went on: Those who seek
to recruit gays for the military and to place women in combat
seek the destruction of the masculine ideal, the feminine ideal
and the military they have always loathed. No one in American
life has understood these issues better than Bill Bennett, who
never spent a day in the armed forces. No admiral, no four-star
general, <I>not even one particular four-star general,</I> has
understood the challenge so well.
<p>
That is what is so deeply hurtful about the current controversy.
It <I>is </I>a family feud. And <I>you </I>are all part of the
family and you have a right to know what is being argued over.
But it is more than that.
<p>
We thought for a long time we would have to battle for the pro-life
planks in the Republican party platform.  We had no illusions
that the Arlen Specters, Pete Wilsons, Bill Welds and Christine
Todd Whitmans would let this brave statement stand unmolested.
But we never dreamed that we would have to defend the platform
from our friends.
<p>
What <I>does </I>the Republican platform say and why is that important?
Since 1976, the Republicans have been committed to a pro-life
position as a matter of party principle. It is vital that they
remain so. That is because no other major political party in the
world is so committed. Certainly not the conservatives in Britain,
nor the right-wing parties of France, Germany, Canada or Australia.
<p>
The platform adopted in 1984 and secured through 1988 and 1992
said that &quot;the unborn child has a right to life which cannot
be infringed.&quot; It pledged the Republicans to work for a Human
Life Amendment. It further urged the selection of judges at every
level who &quot;respect the sanctity of life and traditional family
values.&quot;
<p>
By saying that he could support a pro-choice president, Bill Bennett
has effectively moved to throw out the 20-year commitment of the
GOP to unborn human life. A platform is a statement the party
makes in advancing its candidates, particularly its presidential
ticket. Bennett has taken up the challenge, saying that we should
not pursue the <I>chimera </I>of a Human Life Amendment.
<p>
This is not the first time he has said this. Several years ago,
in response to a reporter's question on radio station KKLA in
Los Angeles, Bennett said of the pro-life plank that it was OK
with him if they wanted to put that in there. As a practical matter,
he said, it isn't going to happen. So what we should concentrate
on is reducing the numbers.
<p>
Well, as a practical matter, we are not going to get a Human Life
Amendment if our leaders disparage the effort. Scripture tells
us <I>where there is no vision, the people perish. </I>But I think
it a grave mistake to turn from leadership to punditry. We are
every day faced with extraordinary realities which few <I>practical
</I>observers would have predicted.
<p>
Take, for example, the collapse of the Soviet Union. Who, writing
the Republican platform of 1988, would have said the party demands
the reunification of Germany, her inclusion within NATO? Who would
have required the evacuation of all Soviet troops from restored
and sovereign Baltic states before the United States would give
Russia a penny in foreign aid? Anyone writing such a platform
plank in `88 would have been thought mad. But, by 1992, <I>no
platform could even be written </I>which did not take into account
the new <I>practical</I> realities.
<p>
From our own history, we know vast change is possible. In 1860,
the Republicans who met in this city to nominate Abraham Lincoln
and write their platform would not have dared to call for the
abolition of chattel slavery and the extension of U.S. citizenship
to the freedmen. But, <I>by</I> 1864, that change was a <I>practical
</I>reality.
<p>
We do not ask our leaders to do the impossible. We certainly do
not ask them to take us into war. But we do not want them to foreclose
the possibility of great and beneficial change in the <I>practical
</I>realities. 
<p>
The tragedy of Bill Bennett's defection is that it comes at a
time when we can see great and hopeful changes occurring. Naomi
Wolf, a feminist, pro-choice author, has written a remarkable
article in <I>The New Republic.</I> Entitled &quot;Our Bodies,
Our Souls,&quot; Miss Wolf's article is an unusual recognition
of the stakes in this vital question. She writes:
<p>
<blockquote><i>Norma McCorvey explained what happened to her in terms of
good and  evil; she woke in the middle of the night and felt a
presence pushing  violently down on her, &quot;I denounce you,
Satan,&quot; she announced.  This way  of talking about evil is
one of the chief class divisions in America:  working-class people
talk about Satan, and...those who run the country  talk instead
about neurotic guilt. While the elite scoff at research that 
shows most Americans maintain a belief in the embodiment of evil--&quot;the
 devil&quot;--they miss something profound about the human need
to make moral order out of chaos.</i></blockquote>
<p>
Miss Wolf is not an ally. She ends her article where she began
it: staunchly supporting what she calls abortion rights. But the
article is filled with amazing concessions and bold statements.
She dares to tell the truth that every abortion stops a beating
heart. And one word of truth, as Solzhenitsyn says, can move the
world. 
<p>
As if <I>The New Republic's </I>publishing this article were not
amazing enough, it was matched in September by a cover story in
<I>The Atlantic Monthly</I>. George McKenna is a law professor.
He urges pro-life politicians to recognize a woman's constitutional
right to choose abortion, but to take effective, practical measures
to restrict abortion. Ultimately, none of us can accept Professor
McKenna's position, but it is in the <I>laying out </I>of that
position that McKenna does the greatest service to all of us.
For he exposes to the light of day the absurdity underlying the
pro-choice arguments. He links them with the arguments made by
Stephen Douglas' Democrats in the 1850s. How marvelous in our
eyes. <I>Atlantic, </I>a flagship of the liberal prestige press,
has publicly accorded the anti-abortion position the dignity of
the Great Emancipator's cloak. This has not happened before.
<p>
While we are taken up, necessarily and painfully, with the fight
in our own divided house, we should not fail to note that our
adversaries' house is in shambles. Their leader thinks abortion
should be &quot;safe, legal and rare.&quot; If it is a fundamental
constitutional right, as the Supreme Court has told us it is,
then why should it be rare? Is there any other <I>fundamental
</I>human right which any of us would even wish to be rare?
<p>
Lincoln knew all about such hypocrisy. In 1860, he said:
<p>
<blockquote><i>Let us apply a few tests. You say that you think slavery 
is wrong, but you  denounce all attempts to restrain it. Is there
anything else that you think  wrong, that you are not willing
to deal with as a wrong? Why are you so  careful, so tender of
this one wrong and no other? You will not let us <b>do</b> a 
single thing as if it was wrong; there is no place where you will
allow it to  be even <b>called</b> wrong! We must not call it
wrong in the Free States  because it is <b>not</b> there, and
we must not call it wrong in the Slave States  because it is there;
we must not call it wrong in politics because that is  bringing
morality into politics, and we must not call it wrong in the pulpit
because that is bringing politics into religion; we must not
bring it into the  Tract Society or other societies, because those
are such unsuitable places,  and there is no single place, according
to you, where this wrong thing can  properly be called wrong!</i></blockquote>
<p>
Last year, the First Lady told <I>Newsweek</I> interviewers that
abortion was wrong. This was about a week before the mid-term
elections. In September, she went all the way to China to tell
the world that forced abortion is wrong.  One would think from
those statements that the wrong thing would not be included in
her health care plan. We might think that this wrong thing would
not be pressed on every country on earth by means of a diplomatic
cable to every U.S. embassy. We might even hope that this wrong
thing would not be pushed on U.S. military hospitals. Or we might
have thought that abortion would not be part of &quot;coordinated
community services&quot; targeted at public schools in states
which accept funds under federal <I>Goals 2000</I> legislation. From 
all these examples, it appears that their true goal is to make abortion 
safe, legal and <I>well done. </I> But, as Lincoln said, some of us are very
<I>tender</I> and <I>careful </I>about the things we call wrong.
<p>
How much we could have used Bill Bennett's strong voice in pointing
out such lethal inconsistencies. Instead, unfortunately, he has
said that it is Dr. Dobson and Paul Weyrich who are inconsistent.
They are inconsistent, he says, because if they <I>really </I>believe
that human lives are being unjustly taken in abortion, they would
be leading the public effort to put women in jail.
<p>
This is a painful wound, coming from a friend. It speaks volumes
about the circles that Bennett is moving in if he really believes
this. He should know better. Bennett knows American history. He
knows American law. He should know that in all of American history
we have found only <I>two </I>instances of women being prosecuted
for having abortions. The good, protective pro-life laws which
existed in every state until the early sixties, and which saved
the lives of millions of unborn children and their mothers, sought
to punish, discourage and stigmatize the <I>abortionist.</I> That's
the truth, and Bennett should know it. And if he doesn't <I>know
</I>the truth, we would at least appreciate his not taking his
debating points from Planned Parenthood's briefing book.
<p>
Bill Bennett had no greater supporters and enthusiasts than us
when he was taking on the hateful, violent and vulgar products
of gangsta rap. Those who sing about raping women and killing
cops should not be cultural heroes. And those who profit from
this execrable trade should be publicly shamed. And God bless
Bennett for doing it.
<p>
Now he has joined with Sen. Joe Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut,
to attack daytime TV talk shows. Again, we say, &quot;Good for
you!&quot; Bennett has called the toxic waste spewing forth from
the tube &quot;an affront to human dignity.&quot; How right he
is.
<p>
But, while he has Joe Lieberman's ear, could he put in a word
about <I>another </I>affront to human dignity?  Could he mention
to his friend how helpful his support would be in the fight against
partial birth abortions?  We must understand how inevitable a
degraded and violent culture becomes when we have accepted the
degrading violence of abortion.
<p>
We just won a great victory in the House, as you know. That vote
of 288-139 to ban partial-birth abortions spanned a broad spectrum.
We won the votes of Henry Hyde, Linda Smith and Helen Chenoweth,
to be sure. But we also gained the support of Dick Gephardt, David
Bonior and even young Patrick Kennedy. Bill Bennett should recognize 
that a pro-life commitment <I>can</I> be the source of great
strength. More than that, a pro-life commitment is the <I>only
</I>way a conservative majority can be sustained in this country. As Gary 
Bauer has noted, can Newt Gingrich point to any <I>other </I>bill that gained 
such strong support in the House?
<p>
Many of us, as pro-lifers, are powerfully moved by the fate of
unborn children. We identify strongly with the child in <I>The
Silent Scream.</I> We empathize strongly, and we want to help
defend and preserve the lives that are threatened with abortion.
We believe that God Himself has called us to do this work.
<p>
But there may be more arguments that can be made to the author
of such works as <I>The Book of Virtues </I>and <I>The Moral Compass,
</I>for one of the cardinal virtues that is wisely taught in the
great Catholic tradition is <I>justice. </I>Abortion is not only
violent and bloody. War is that. Abortion is also <I>unjust. </I>And
those who sit on the nation's highest court, who have told us
that the right to abortion is to be found in the &quot;liberty
interest&quot; of our Constitution, are not dispensing justice,
but <I>injustice.</I>
<p>
Lincoln was certainly moved by the fate of the poor slave. He
said that even a dumb brute, <I>even an ant,</I> knows when he
is wronged. But it was this conscious embrace of <I>injustice
</I>which Lincoln likened to a wen, a cancer, a dread disease.
If unchecked, Lincoln knew, it would one day claim the life of
the country itself.
<p>
It is also the federal judiciary which has so consistently undermined
law enforcement in our country. Small wonder, then, that when
justices are indifferent to justice, juries nullify verdicts and
people get away with murder. So, we must tell our neighbors, don't
expect that the blood-rimmed tide will ebb before it gets to <I>your
</I>doorstep. Making abortion legal makes America a violent, bloody
and dangerous place to live. Making abortion legal unravels the
very fabric of society.
<p>
Edmund Burke said we should love our country, that in order to
be loved our country should be lovely. A pro-abortion America
can never be lovely. How can we assert our own right to life if
we, as a nation, deny it to others?
<p>
I wish I could report to you tonight that the fight between Bill
Bennett and the rest of us is just--Washington loves this word--a
flap. I would be happy to say it will soon be smoothed over, and
we will all be friends again. But abortion is not simply an <I>issue</I>,
as Bennett sometimes calls it. It is no more <I>an issue</I> than
Pilate's calling for a choice between Jesus and Barabbas was a
straw poll. To say that we might advance our cause by choosing
leaders who don't understand or believe in our cause is to risk
all that we have accomplished in public policy, all that moves
us to take part in civic life.
<p>
So I am here to report to you that the mood of pro-lifers in Washington
is resolute, unyielding. And I sense that yours is, too. We are
ready to walk with you in the footsteps of the faithful. We will
not break faith with God or with you. If we suffer defections, broken 
friendships, that is regrettable. But that will not deter us.
Churchill, who knew what it was to stand alone, kept faith in
his time with the long history of Christian civilization against
a brutal, pagan tyranny. He would not speak of dark days, but
of <I>stern </I>days. These, too,  are stern days. 
I think we can win the fight for the Republican pro-life platform.
But, no matter what happens, I know that we will never give in.
Thirteen years ago, Jean Garton spoke to a right to life convention
in Connecticut. She spoke memorably then, as she always does.
Her word at that time was <I>reticulation</I>. She described it
as the veins in a leaf. If one was blocked, or cut off, others
could always take its place. So, if we are blocked in the political realm, 
we can still find paths of service. All that is needed is that we continue 
in the footsteps of the faithful. Thank you and God bless you.

<title>FAMILY PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT HEARING</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2>FAMILY PRIVACY PROTECTION<br>
ACT HEARING</h2>
<p>
<h4>Testimony of Robert H. Knight<br>
Director of Cultural Studies, Family Research Council</br>
regarding HR 1271<br>
before the<br>
Committee on Governmental Affairs<br>
of the<br>
United States Senate<br>
November 9, 1995</h4></center>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
Thank you for inviting me to speak on behalf of the Family Research
Council, and, by extension, on behalf of many parents all over
the United States.
<p>
The Final Report of the White House Working Group on the Family
includes these words:
<p>
&quot;Parental nurturing and education of the young is our most
important national investment.  It is the fundamental task of
humanity.&quot;
<p>
Notwithstanding a few cataclysmic events, such as the collapse
of the Soviet empire, nothing has happened since then to alter
the truth of this observation, penned in 1986 by Gary Bauer, who
is now president of Family Research Council.  Indeed, it could
have been said at any time and in any place.
<p>
We often hear from child rights advocates that &quot;it takes
a village to raise a child,&quot; but  parents are indispensable.
 Not even a whole village can replicate them.  As the people most
responsible for and most equipped to discern the needs of their
children, parents must be accorded deference in all matters related
to education.  Children in public and private schools are taught
by dedicated professionals, but only because parents consent to
have these professionals participate in their children's education.
<p>
No one but a parent can understand how parents feel about their
own children.  And I am talking about adoptive parents as well
as biological parents.  Mother Teresa describes such devotion through a 
firsthand observation at her clinic in Calcutta:
<p><blockquote>
<i>I never forget, I gave a child to a Hindu family, and after
a few months, I heard that the child became very, very sick. 
And I sent for the family, and I told them, give me back that
child.   I'll take care of the sick child, and I'll give you another
healthy child.  And the father looked at me and said, 'Mother,
take my life rather than take the child.'&quot;</i>
</blockquote><p>
Like this Indian father, most parents would lay down their lives
for their children.  And they are acutely aware of their responsibility.
 So decisions about what kind of information is conveyed to children
or extracted from them are the parents' natural prerogative.
<p>
Any research methods that place a barrier between children and
their parents should be outlawed.  Increasingly, parents have
found themselves fighting for their most fundamental rights against
some hostile educators and government officials who honestly believe
that they, not parents, know what is best for children.  Such
officials work overtime to acquaint children with revisionist
history, graphic sexual materials and relativistic notions of
morality -- all in the name of education.
<p>
Often, parents are unaware of what the children are receiving.
The concept of informed consent is faulty because there are too
many ways for it to fail.  Parents are not given adequate information.
And a teacher may send a child home with an announcement about
an upcoming survey, but unless the parent signs a permission form,
there is no way to determine if the message got through.
<p>
To those who argue that written requirements are cumbersome and
expensive, well, the loss of parental freedom to determine a child's
education is a far higher cost -- one that is unacceptable.  Besides,
there are other ways that information can be obtained on dangerous
behaviors.  Documentation of the number of cases of out-of-wedlock
pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, suicides, drug overdoses
and the like is readily available. The drive to target all teens
because of the actions of the unfortunate few is a manifestation
of the educational dogma that information in and of itself, with
no moral reference, can make a difference.  But two decades of
research have shown that giving youngsters more &quot;value-free&quot;
information about sex, for instance, has not resulted in any behavioral
change, except perhaps earlier experimentation.
<p>
With the advent of Goals 2000, and its emphasis on national standards
and accountability, the role of testing is becoming paramount.
Outcome-based education, as implemented by Goals 2000, moves
schools away from the strictly academic and toward the production
of certain &quot;attitudes.&quot; Consequently, the line is becoming
blurred between what is educational and what is therapeutic.
<p>
Parents are concerned over surveys for two reasons:
<p>
1) Some questionnaires may reveal information that is nobody's
business but that of the family; and 2) some questionnaires convey
information to which parents would rather not expose their children.
<p>
The issue of parental consent for research has been driven primarily
by a spate of sex, suicide and drug surveys among young teens,
some of which have been politically motivated and manipulated.
A few years ago, a national youth survey on sexuality contained
questions that were so graphic as to be, in many parents' estimation,
pornographic.
<p>
Concern over research on hapless children has also been driven
by revelations of abuses by federally-funded researchers going
as far back as the sex studies of Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey in the
1940s.  It was under grants from the congressionally chartered
National Research Council that Dr. Kinsey collected his materials
for what became known as the Kinsey Report, the largest sex survey
ever at that time.  Under the rubric of science, systematic molestation
of some 317 children was analyzed and recorded in graph tables.
Nowhere is there evidence that parental consent was given for
what were clearly criminal acts.  In fact, no one, not even parents,
could give consent for such acts, but that did not stop the Kinsey
&quot;scientists.&quot;
<p>
Further documentation of this shameful episode of scientific abuse
can be found in the Family Research Council documentary video
<I>The Children of Table 34</I>, which I am submitting for the
record, and in <i>Kinsey Sex and Fraud, The Indoctrination of
a People</i>, by Dr. Judith A. Reisman, Edward W. Eichel, with
Drs. J. Gordon Muir and John Court as editors (Huntington House:
1990).
<p>
Now, we are not suggesting that the mere taking of a survey is
equivalent to the kind of abuse that Kinsey recorded.  Just that
there is a temptation to gather information because it <I>can</I>
be done without asking whether it <I>should</I> be done.
<p>
Sometimes, the impact on the survey taker seems calculated to
increase curiosity about deviant behavior.  Surveys that ask questions
about suicide or drug usage, for example, can plant the idea of
either activity as an option, when a teen may never have entertained
the thought before.  Through sheer repetition of reference, harmful
activities can lose their power to inspire natural resistance.
After all, a teen may reasonably conclude,  &quot;If we are talking
about all this stuff so much, doesn't that mean that everybody
is doing it?&quot;  Children were exposed to descriptions of homosexual
activity, for example, which is a way of forcing the topic to
the front burner.  As a homosexual activist once wrote:  &quot;The
main thing is to talk about gayness until the issue becomes thoroughly
tiresome.&quot;
<p>
Sex surveys in and of themselves are notoriously unreliable, being
skewed toward the sexually unconventional.  They can also be objectionable.
Little Susie responds to a question that asks if she is a virgin.  If she 
answers yes, then she is supposed to skip through several detailed questions 
about sexual activities, such as how many sex partners she has had.
After an exercise like that, she may feel like a sexual underachiever
for having kept chaste.  Teens are very peer conscious, and can
feel left out and stigmatized for having to exempt themselves
from a battery of questions. Likewise, if the onus is on the parent
to opt a child out of such intrusive experiences, the possibility
for stigma is greater than if all parents have to opt their children
in.  Those who administer surveys are more interested in high
compliance than parental input, so they tend to be opposed to
such safeguards.  But in the scheme of things, parents' rights
must come first.
<p>
Family Research Council supports efforts to safeguard the rights
of parents to direct their children's education and welfare, and
that includes how, where and when children are included in research.
Parents are assigned that task by no less an authority than God
Himself.  It would be the epitome of hubris to tamper with that
bond because some educational experts feel that they are smarter
than everybody else.

<title>THE CASE FOR REBUILDING CIVIL SOCIETY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2>THE CASE FOR REBUILDING<br>
CIVIL SOCIETY</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by<br>
Dr. Michael Novak</i></center>
<p>
<i>This speech was the keynote address at the Family Research
Council's &quot;World Without Welfare&quot; symposium on December
13, 1995 at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C.</i>
<p>
Thank you for allowing me to come to this important conference
and to share in the really central work of the Family Research
Council.
<p>
When we talk about welfare, it's good to make a distinction right
up front.  The war on poverty in the mid-1960s did make a real
difference for the elderly, for the sick, and for the disabled
that we shouldn't disregard.  It was in certain aspects a great
success for the elderly, for example.  In 1965, the largest group
of the poor were those over age 65.  In the 1960s, in John Kennedy's
campaign and when Michael Harrington's book was being bruited
about, pictures of the poor on the covers of <I>Life</I> magazine
or <I>Look</I> or other magazines of the time were inevitably
pictures of the elderly.  If you look today, by almost every measure,
the elderly are almost entirely out of poverty.  If there are
elderly poor, it's because they are not connected to systems that
are in place to help them.  Moreover, in 1965 we counted as elderly
all people who were 65 or over.  Today, the real worrisome part
of the elderly is the &quot;elderly elderly,&quot; the over 85s,
whose numbers have increased to proportions that are comparable
to the proportions of those over 65 just 30 years ago.
<p>
Now the financial aspects of this accomplishment, the funding
mechanisms that we used, are still serious problems.  And thus
we're quite worried about the future of Medicare and even the
future of Social Security.  But the programs in and of themselves
were a great success, and I think it's worth setting that aside
from our discussion for the moment -- although the funding mechanisms
do need a great deal of attention.  It is also true that the position
of the disabled and the sick is much better than it was just 30
years ago.
<p>
<center><h3>THE FAILURE OF AFDC</h3></center>
<p>
There is, nonetheless, a sense in which welfare programs have
dramatically failed.  When we say welfare, we typically mean the
poverty programs that were addressed to young people, young adults
between the ages of 16 and 45 in particular.  And the chief program
that has been worrisome has been AFDC, Aid to Families with Dependent
Children.  In the late 1930s when it was founded, AFDC was predominantly
a program for widows; and for many years afterward, 95 percent
or more of the people who received aid under that program were
widows whose husbands were hurt in mining accidents or mill accidents
or some other kind of accident.  Then after 1965, with great rapidity,
AFDC became a program predominantly for young single women having
children out of wedlock.  When we say welfare in America, when
the public hears that word, that's the part of the problem they
almost always fix on.  And it is very well worth fixing on.
<p>
The Family Research Council is one of the organizations that grew
up to respond to the insight that, if you help the family -- often,
I should add, unformed families not based on marriage -- you have
identified the surest and most direct safeguard against poverty.
If the family is healthy and functioning well, you don't need
what used to be called the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare.  That's what the family does when it's functioning well.
And when the family isn't functioning well, not everything that
all the Departments of Health, Education and Welfare do can make
up for the loss.  As I once put it, the family is the only Department
of Health, Education and Welfare that works.
<p>
Now, one of the insights that the public senses, but many critics
of welfare reform don't seem to grasp, is the sheer devastation
wrought by the programs we launched in 1965.  Those of us who
supported the War on Poverty, as I certainly did, did not warn
the citizenry that if you adopt this program we will bring you
a 600 percent increase in violent crime and a 500 percent increase
in births out of wedlock.  That wasn't our intention.  Nobody
foresaw that happening or wanted it to happen.  But that's what
did happen.  In other words, it's important to grasp the damage
that welfare is doing.  The reason for being concerned about welfare
reform today -- and trying to imagine a &quot;world without welfare&quot;
-- is not a budgetary reason.  It's not its cost.  The cost is
not insuperable.  If welfare were doing good, we would gladly
support it.  Most of us would.  I think the vast majority would.
What's disconcerting to people is that welfare is manifestly
doing harm.  Or, to put it another way, it's not achieving the
goods it set out to achieve.  And the problems it set out to address
are not getting better.
<p>
Witness John Kennedy's statement in early 1963 about the first
move toward welfare reform, which later became the War on Poverty
after his death.  The message he sent to Congress said it was
intended to strengthen the American family, to put an end to juvenile
delinquency.  Can you imagine how quaint a term that later would
become?  Who speaks of &quot;juvenile delinquency&quot;?  That's
a term from the 1950s and 1960s.  That's long gone.  It's violent
crime.  Juvenile delinquency was ended.  It became violent crime.
But those were the intentions of the program, and it failed to
achieve them.
<p>
I want to warn you to be careful here too.  It's very hard to
show that welfare has caused all the civic destruction that has
happened since 1965 among families we intended to help.  So many
other things happened, television and affluence and urban renewal.
It's hard to isolate any one explanation.  But at a minimum,
one can say that welfare in this narrower sense that I'm using
was aimed to address these problems and didn't succeed.  The problems
have grown worse than they were 30 years ago.
<p>
<center><h3>HALVING THE FAMILY</h3></center>
<p>
In Washington, D.C., where we are meeting, 64 percent of all pregnancies
end in abortion.  Of those young children who survive that, 70
percent plus are born out-of-wedlock.  Now the fact that they're
born out-of-wedlock means in reality that these youngsters will
be born without the presence of half of an extended family.  That
is, they will generally lack grandparents, uncles, and aunts on
one side of the family.  And on the woman's side of the family,
perhaps the family will be supportive.  Usually it is, but it
may not be.  But already the child's world is cut in half from
what a child would normally have.  And if the child is born into
a household which is disconnected from the world of work and disconnected
from neighbors who also work, that child is born without connections
to the world of work.  The prognosis for later employment is very
poor.  The health prognosis is poor.  The prognosis for finishing
school is poor.  The prognosis for involvement in the criminal
justice system is very high.  In this city, the chances of involvement
in the criminal justice system by the age of 30 are about 80 percent.
So those who want to continue welfare as we know it carry on
their shoulders a very heavy burden of proof.  I believe that
the Catholic bishops who are resisting some of the move for reform
are not facing as directly as they ought the moral responsibility
that accrues to them for continuing the program as it now is.
<p>
One of the worst features of the welfare program as it now is,
especially for the young, is that it takes good healthy young
people who are able to be creative and energetic and to show initiative
and it leaves them in a state of dependency in two respects. 
First, many of them are not there to be able to take care of their
children or their parents.  In other words, the healthy young
adults are usually the ones on whom the elderly depend, not on
whom children depend.  And for the most part, because they are
not working, they do not have the means to take care of those
who depend on them.  But secondly, this seems to bring with it
certain psychic wounds because many such people are not able to
be independent themselves.  They throw themselves on the care
of the government, on the care of the larger society, both for
the care of their dependents and for their own care.  And then
there's a third sense of dependency, too, for a very high proportion
of them.  While their schooling is free, they don't complete school.
Many become involved in alcohol or drugs and in other sorts of
behavior that are self-destructive. 
<p>
In all three of these senses, we have learned since 1965 that
poverty -- that is, a lack of material resources -- is not the
worst consequence but dependency in these three senses is much
worse.  It takes someone who ought to be a self-governing citizen,
self-reliant, brave, showing initiative, creating jobs, and leaves
them in the state of counting on others for the most basic things.
I hate even to bring up this aspect, but generally it leaves
them also with a great loss of spiritual morale, or self-esteem.
It's the self-esteem I hate to mention.  But it is in these cases
a very important reality with which to cope.  It's hard, when
you're not achieving, to have a sense of proper adult achievement.
<p>
America was never founded to be a society for dependent people.
The American experiment is an experiment in self-government,
and I want to talk about that in the second part of my remarks
now.  What it means to have republican government is to have a
government which allows most decisions, most social activities,
to be undertaken by the citizens themselves.  They're self-governing.
They are able to manage their social lives.  They are able to
manage their social necessities.  One of the most extraordinary
things about the founding of this republic, commented on by Tocqueville
50 years after the founding, is the capacity of Americans to organize
themselves to take care of their own needs.
<p>
<center><h3>ASSOCIATION: THE AMERICAN CHARACTER</h3></center>
<p>
My wife and I recovered the diary of an ancestor of hers.  Believe
it or not, his name was Charlie Brown.  He was the son of the
first Baptist missionary in the Iowa Territory before it became
a state, and Charles Brown writes in his diary day after day about
the importance of individualism, the importance of the individual.
But that's not what he describes.  What's in his head is how
much individual initiative it took to depart from the family back
east near Syracuse, and before that in Massachusetts, and to move
out to this new territory where the plow had not cut the soil
ever.  When he arrived, it was buffalo grass.  Not many people
lived there because the native Americans used it mostly as a hunting
ground.  It was not for farming, and most people passed on through.
Day after day, what Brown describes is like &quot;yesterday we
worked on the farm of so and so putting up a barn.&quot;  And
on another day they're putting a bridge over a creek.  And on
another day they're putting up the equivalent of a city hall.
And on another day they're working on the school.  The substance
of his days is working together with neighbors on projects to
make their common life go, to make it work.
<p>
What I'm trying to establish is that this is the building of civil
society.  This is the building of the ability of human beings
to live together in a good community when there's no government,
or only a very diminished form of government.  As Tocqueville
says, this is the great advantage the Americans had.  They were
so lightly governed.  The King and Parliament hardly paid them
attention, except to tax them.  They were organized first in villages
and townships and only much later in counties and states.  Only
after virtually 200 years were they organized in a federal government.
So, Americans learned how to conduct a social life for themselves
before they had government.
<p>
Tocqueville also remarks, in his reflections on the revolution
in France, that at the time of the revolution there were not 10
men in all of France who were capable of practicing the art of
association as Americans were.  What he meant by that was that
in France when something is needed people turn to the state to
do it.  And in Britain people turn to the aristocracy to fund
it. In America, they turned to one another.  They formed associations.
<p>
Tocqueville formed the principle that the first law of democracy
is the principle of association.  The very first law is that democracy
will only work where people are capable of self-government --
forming their own associations and making communal decisions,
and figuring out the mechanisms to make those fairly and well.
Tocqueville observed that people became practiced in the art
of association almost universally in America.  People formed associations,
he observed, to fund missionaries, to build colleges, to put up
buildings, to bring music to a village or town, to stage a play.
They formed associations for every imaginable purpose.  They
didn't turn to government because in the early days there was
no government to turn to, only a government of very limited resources
and very limited authority.
<p>
Now this is what our Framers intended by the experiment in self-government,
&quot;of the people, by the people, for the people.&quot;  For
this reason, governments are formed among men to secure these
rights. You do have to have a government, as the generation of
our Framers discovered for themselves when they were badly governed
by the Articles of Confederation.  They needed to form a more
perfect Constitution to form a more perfect union.  Their project
was not an anti-government program, in other words.  But it was
a matter of getting government right, and part of getting government
right was to leave space for people to govern themselves.  So
&quot;government by government&quot; would play as small a role
as necessary.  That is the original and has been the continuing
American experiment, and I think that the restlessness we are
seeing in the country is an urge to return to something like that
-- to &quot;devolve,&quot; as current rhetoric would have it.
Largely because of the great wars of the 20th century, the first
world war and the second, the federal government has far more
centralized power than anyone had earlier envisaged.
<p>
<center><h3>ESCAPING POVERTY THE FAMILY WAY</h3></center>
<p>
It isn't fair to say that all of our associations or social units
are voluntary.   Most are, but there are some that are given to
us by nature.  And one of those is the family.  I've already mentioned
the centrality of the family, but let me give you one more little
factoid that's impressive.  If you do three things in the United
States, it's very difficult to be poor -- less than a five percent
chance.  The first is to complete high school, which is free and
in fact mandatory.  In most states you can be picked up by a truant
officer for not attending school, but a substantial number of
people still don't.  Secondly, you are likely to avoid poverty
if you work full-time, even at a minimum wage job.   And finally,
you should get married or, with difficulty, manage to stay married.
<p>
Just a very few years ago, only about 6 percent of married couple
families were poor.  Today it's about 8 percent.  Marriage alone,
then, gives you a 92 percent chance of getting out of poverty.
The two incomes, in any case the support of two people, seem
to have some financial and also psychological power that is of
great assistance.  And, of course, with work and with at least
the minimum of a high school education, you do very well.  We
see this being realized every day.
<p>
One of the things that has changed the argument in the country
dramatically in the last 20 years is the influx of immigrants
from very poor backgrounds from all over the world.  They arrive
financially poor, but in a short time are <I>not</I> poor.  Their
success through family and work -- and particularly their success
in pushing their children in education -- has led them to move
out of poverty.  That in turn has restored our faith in the possibilities
within the American system for helping the poor regularly move
out of poverty.  What sticks in the craw of Americans, in fact,
is the vision before their eyes of so many people not moving out
of poverty.  That's what's uncharacteristic, that's what's unprecedented.
And that's what gives people the sense that the system is failing.
The system is meant to move people out of poverty within a decade
or so, a generation at most.  And when it's not doing that, that's
what makes people say there is something wrong with the system,
something we've done wrong in our design of it.
<p>
It's always wise to remind yourself that the vast majority of
people who are poor and who are on welfare are white.  The press
often tries to portray this as a &quot;black problem&quot; --
that is, they will frequently show black people when they talk
about welfare.  But any of you who come from states with more
rural settings, or states with smaller towns and cities, know
the increase in welfare among whites all over the United States.
Even the increase of illegitimacy today among whites is now higher
than it was in 1965 when Daniel Patrick Moynihan declared it a
disaster among blacks.  It's now higher among whites and growing
more rapidly than among blacks.
<p>
The family, therefore, is one of the crucial places to apply our
attention.  This is not habitual among social scientists and American
intellectuals in general.  Political thought for the last 200
years has been more or less mesmerized by the two great discoveries
of the last 200 years: the nation-state and the individual.  For
the first time in history, a great many individuals moved away
from their families through migration or through the opening up
of new occupations.  They moved into occupations untraditional
in their family.  Sometimes they changed their religious background.
It's been a hugely migratory two centuries.  All of us here are
a part of that migration to the United States over a very short
period, the greatest migration in human history. We became aware,
therefore, of separating from family, of being an individual.
And there are many other factors that led to this as well.  
<p>
<center><h3>&QUOT;THE GREAT DRAMATIC MIDDLE&QUOT;</h3></center>
<p>
But simultaneously, we became aware of the formation of the nation-state.
And thus by and large progressives -- liberals as we tend to
call them in this country -- when presented with a problem, typically
tend to think of a state solution for it.  And on the other hand,
conservatives faced with a problem typically have tried to think
of something that the individual could do.  And our social thought
has been oscillating between these two extreme views: the individual
and the state.  We have overlooked the great dramatic middle in
which most human life is lived.
<p>
I don't know about you, but practically the only place I get to
be alone is on an airplane.  And I get to be alone only after
I answer two questions.  The person next to me always eventually
says, &quot;What do you do?&quot;  And I figured out the answer
that stops most of them cold.  I say, &quot;I teach,&quot; in
roughly that tone of voice.  Most of them have dreadful memories
of school, and that usually ends the conversation right there.
A few of them are brave souls and they will say, showing their
sophistication, &quot;What do you teach?&quot;  And I have a perfect
answer for that too.  I say, in as brief a voice as I can, &quot;Humanities.&quot;
And they say, &quot;Oh.&quot;  And that's it, I'm free.  There
are no committee meetings and no telephones.  For an hour and
a half or four hours, or whatever it is, I have the first solitude
I've had in days.  The rest of the time seems to be spent in committees
and meetings.  Most of our time is spent with other people.
<p>
American life is probably the most social life in the world. 
One of the most difficult tasks in America is getting the whole
family to sit down together at the dinner table because somebody
always has band practice or hockey practice, or a meeting.  And
if you want to get one night together, you almost have to enforce
it the way the Mormons do.   It has to be a family night, and
everybody must be home.  I had an Italian friend, and I asked
him why he came to work in &quot;Cleave-a-land,&quot; which is
how he said it. &quot;To make money, to find fortune,&quot; he
said.  &quot;And why did you go back to Italy?&quot; I asked.
&quot;To live,&quot; he said.  In Italy you take a shave and
a haircut -- two hours.  In America, eight minutes.  In Italy
you have dinner all evening -- four hours, normal.  In America,
in the evenings you're at meetings.  He said the trouble with
America is that you work eight hours a day and then you go to
eight hours of meetings.  We're a very social people, with our
families and all the different organizations and groups that we
belong to.  We live a richly social life.
<p>
It's not a community life in the way the Europeans imagined community,
however.  When the Europeans imagine community they always think
of a village somewhere in the mountains where everybody shares
the same faith and the same outlook and families have known one
another for hundreds of years and are almost like family together.
That's the European sense of community.  It is not, I think,
the highest sense of community.  It's a lovely form of community,
but it is quite oppressive and often xenophobic.  It distresses
others, and it is often repressive of the talents and abilities
of rare people within it.
<p>
Well, to pick up the theme I began with, the family, the association,
the capacity of Americans to look around, see a need and form
an organization to meet it -- that is what a &quot;world without
welfare&quot; is going to call on Americans to do more and more.
My friend Phil Merrill, who is the publisher of the <I>Washingtonian</I>
and other newspapers in this city and a shrewd observer of life,
predicts that in the next 20 years there's going to be the most
massive transfer of wealth in the history of this republic.  He
points out, &quot;Just look at pictures of the city of Washington
30 years ago and overlay them with a photograph of today.  Look
at how many new buildings have gone up.  Look at areas like Bethesda
and Falls Church and the whole surrounding area that were residential
communities and today are bustling communities with factories
and offices of every sort all over.  Think of the fortunes that
have been made in auto dealerships and real estate.&quot;  People
have more money than they are going to be able to leave to their
children.  Most of that money will go into the greatest outbreak
of philanthropy that the country has ever known, and therefore
that the world has ever known.
<p>
The stock market, in the 12 months of this year, has gone up one
trillion dollars of new wealth.  It's just astonishing what is
going on around us.  New industries, new technologies that were
not even thought of, are coming on-line.  When people talk about
our children being worse off than we were when we grew up and
lacking the same opportunities, they are overlooking the wealth
in home ownership and pensions -- the hidden forms of wealth that
are not usually counted.  When you see these comparisons of the
concentration of wealth, they almost all leave out your home,
your personal possessions, your compact discs.  What most of us
count as our wealth isn't counted.  What they count as wealth
is stock ownership, which some 20 to 30 million American families
have, but not everybody.  Thus, those studies have a necessary
conclusion that wealth is concentrated because they count only
a certain kind of wealth.
<p>
<center><h3>CATS, CHOICES, AND CHARACTER</h3></center>
<p>
Now, the last requirement of a self-governing society -- beyond
the capacity to form associations, to strengthen families, and
to form associations to meet whatever needs we discern -- is the
personal requirement.  The project of self-government will only
succeed with a certain kind of people.  It's a fantasy, Madison
said, to imagine that a republic can be made to work without virtue.
Now by the word &quot;virtue,&quot; the Framers meant certain
habits that a people must have if it wishes to be a free people.
They thought that there are peoples on this planet who are not
capable of liberty because they do not have the habits of self-government.
And they, therefore, will not be able to make self-government
work.  Now what did they mean by &quot;self-government&quot;?
They meant the capacity for two actions in particular.  Out of
all the things human beings do, there are two that are most particular
to our being human.  One is the capacity for reflection or deliberation.
And the other is the capacity for choosing.  And the two together
are what make liberty.
<p>
The capacity for deliberation or for reflection is a simple one.
I can best explain it in relationship to the two cats we have
at home.  I hate cats, you have to understand.  But our daughters
when they were 6 and 7 years old, each brought home a cat and
begged us to adopt them, lest they meet a terrible fate.  They
promised they would take care of the cats forever, and the parents
would never have to do anything.  The only problem is our children
are grown up and gone, and we still have the cats.  We can't even
leave home without finding a catsitter.  One is orange, and one
is black and white.  One is thin, and one is fat.  And one is
quick, and one is slow and dimwitted.  There's no question that
our cats have different personalities.
<p>
On the other hand, there's one thing we never have to worry about,
as we do have to worry with our children -- What career are they
going to choose?  Our children act.  They think of things that
we wish they wouldn't think of and then do them.  Our cats, on
the other hand, behave as cats always have since the time the
first one posed for the Sphinx.  In 5,000 years, cats have done
nothing original.  It's behavior.  Our children are capable of
reflecting on the future, seeing alternatives and choosing among
them.  They're capable of looking back on the past and finding
things that they're sorry for and things they're pleased with
and happy about.  That capacity to reflect is crucial to liberty.
<p>
Our Framers distinguished between two different kinds of liberty.
Tocqueville points this out in the first pages of <I>Democracy
in America</I>: the liberty proper to animals and the liberty
proper to human beings.  Our cats just do what they please.  Whatever
instinct tells them to do, they do.  They cannot do other than
obey their instincts.  Human beings have several different sets
of instincts which are at war with one another.  And human beings
have to choose which instincts to follow.  The capacity for self-government
is the capacity to choose under the light of reflection and deliberation.
The French built the Statue of Liberty to reflect this new idea
of liberty.  The idea of &quot;libert&eacute;&quot; failed in
the French Revolution, but the idea of liberty succeeded in North
America -- the kind of liberty that Pope John Paul II has insisted
on calling Ordered Liberty ever since his first visit to America.
That, he said, is the great contribution of American civilization
to world civilization.  The concept of the practice and institutions
of ordered liberty.
<p>
The French didn't know what sort of monument to build.  They wanted
to build one of the great monuments of the world.  They formed
a committee.  Being French, their first decision was easy.  It
would be the figure of a woman.  A woman is the symbol of liberty
in French oceanography from at least the fifth century.  Not the
young male with a weapon, but a woman, Lady Wisdom.  In her right
arm, they put the torch of reason, of light against the mist and
fog of bigotry and passion and ignorance.  And in her other arm
they put the book of the law.  Liberty under reason, liberty under
law.  It's a distinctive understanding of liberty.  To be free
is to act from reflection and deliberation, which is hard.  Often
we act out of instinct, out of passion, out of impulse.  But to
act soberly with reflection and self-mastery, as Jefferson and
Washington are described, is the very model of self-government.
Now how, Madison asked, can you have self-government in the republic
if you don't have self-government in the citizens?  You can't
imagine that a people incapable of self-government in their private
lives can practice self-government in their public lives.
<p>
Now I think what we need to understand is that this is our model
for the poor.  It always has been -- just as it has been for the
rich.  The capacity for self-government, the capacity for a certain
independence, for reflective and deliberate behavior, and the
acceptance of the consequences of decisions.  And that's exactly
what our current welfare programs have destroyed in large numbers
of people.  And poor people coming from around the world see this
and tell themselves, &quot;Stay off welfare.  It's a honey trap.
It can so easily destroy.&quot;
<p>
<center><h3>TOWARD A &QUOT;WORLD WITHOUT WELFARE&QUOT;</h3></center>
<p>
Well, when we talk about reconstituting civil society, that's
our agenda.  It's an agenda on a very full spectrum.  Everything
from recovering the habits that Bill Bennett tried to bring to
our attention in the <I>Book of Virtues</I>, to renewing the spirit
of volunteerism, the habit of Americans to look around and see
what needs doing, and then do it themselves without turning to
government.  If we have government help, then we will often need
to find ways of having the government help indirectly rather than
directly.  Rather than giving direct subsidies, we should find
an indirect way of helping institutions that encourage the independent,
self-reliant, community-minded behavior that is proper to self-government.
We need a whole new imagination about what we're going to ask
of government and how we're going to ask it to help.
<p>
We know that in a society as mobile and intercontinental as we
are, there are going to be people who fall through the net.  Families
aren't going to be there to help them because they're far from
their families.  In this sense, we understand that there has to
be a welfare net of some kind.  But how to provide this help?
It does not have to be done in the manner in which it has been
done for the last 30 years.  We've succeeded for the elderly,
but it was a grand failure for young people despite all good intentions.
So our agenda is a very large one, and it's useful as we begin
these reflections for the day to keep in mind how many different
things we have to do at once.  It's an entire rethinking, reformulating
or reconstituting, of the American experiment -- something that
Jefferson said that we ought to do every 18 and a third years
just on principle.  Thank you very much.

<title>EFFECTIVE COMPASSION</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2>EFFECTIVE COMPASSION</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by<br>
Dr. Marvin Olasky</i></center>
<p>
<i>This speech was presented at the Family Research Council's
&quot;World Without Welfare&quot; symposium on December 13, 1995
at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C.</i>
<p>
This is somewhat of a difficult assignment for me.  At this point,
the only time I get nervous in speaking is when my wife is in
the room.  My goal in life is to try to please her, and I start
to wonder and worry.  As I look around the room here today, I
see not my wife -- she is happily warm in Texas -- but so many
other people from whom I've learned so much and whom I honor.
John Perkins over here, who has been doing wonderful things for
30 years.  Wayne Gordon with the Christian Community Development
Association.  Guy Condon with Care Net.  Duane Higgins in Alabama.
Reverend Ron Moore in Mississippi.  Father Sirico of the Acton
Institute in Michigan.  Bill Schambra from the Bradley Foundation.
Reverend John Woods and Mrs. Woods from the Gospel Mission here
in Washington.  I was noting down the people as I came in the
room.  It just goes on and on.
<p>
So what can I possibly do to explain what's going on to all these
folks from whom I've learned so much?  Just a few thoughts.  And
this may not be the best-organized speech you will have heard
this year, but it comes from the heart.
<p>
<center><h3>WELFARE: THE THIRD CHARGE</h3></center>
<p>
I start out by thinking about all the people here who are not
only well-intentioned but also intent on seeing good results,
who understand the difference between effective compassion and
what is well-intentioned but often does exactly the opposite of
what it sets out to do.  I have found in traveling around the
country this year lots and lots of soft hearts, wonderfully soft
hearts.  But, alas, they tend to go along with soft heads.  You
see this in church bulletins with notices about helping the homeless.
Here are three that have been brought to my attention this year.
First, &quot;Thursday night:  dinner for the homeless.  Medication
to follow.&quot;  Here's another, &quot;At the evening service
tonight the sermon topic will be 'Seeing Hell Close Up.'  Come
early to meet homeless visitors.&quot;  And one more, &quot;Don't
let homelessness kill you.  Let the church help.&quot;  A lot
of good intentions, a lot of soft hearts, some soft heads as well.
<p>
This is a wonderful hotel to be meeting in.  This is the hotel
where U.S. Grant used to hang out when he came here right after
the Civil War -- or as we call it in Texas still, the &quot;War
of Northern Aggression.&quot;  U.S. Grant, when he stayed here
following the Civil War, did not have much of a sense of humor.
But you could excuse him for that.  He had seen too much during
that terrible war in which 600,000 soldiers died.  Recently I
visited the Cold Harbor Battlefield southeast of Richmond.  That's
the one where Grant ordered three frontal assaults against strong
Confederate positions.  It was obvious to the soldiers that they
could not make it.  It was so obvious that they sewed their names
and addresses to the backs of their uniforms before the battle
so that their bodies could be identified and the next of kin notified
more easily.  Grant later said that his biggest regret of the
whole war was ordering that third charge.  The first, maybe, just
to see whether it could be done.  The second, dubious.  The third,
just a total tragic disaster.  The body count just went on and
on.  People stacked up in an area the length of about a football
field and the width of maybe a couple of fields.
<p>
At least U.S. Grant admitted that he had made a mistake.  And
that is far more than some liberal defenders of the welfare status
quo are now doing.  The <I>Washington Post</I> yesterday had a
headline, &quot;Daschle Says Final Welfare Plan Has Lost Democratic
Support.&quot;  And so all that's left apparently is to defend
the status quo.  That should be an oxymoron:  a liberal defender
of the status quo.  That's a combination that is not quite right,
like &quot;dry rain&quot; or &quot;trustworthy Clinton.&quot;
But alas, the liberals who come from such a proud tradition of
looking at the horizon, going where no man has gone before (or
at least sometimes no sane man), are now left with defending the
status quo.  Liberals, with this wonderful tradition of so much
progress, particularly in racial matters, are defending the status
quo.  How the mighty have fallen.
<p>
It's even worse.  We saw through the 1970s and the 1980s how children
suffered as families dissolved or never were formed by people
who had the consciousness of the sixties.  Some had soft hearts,
but many had soft heads.  And now in the '90s, the last refuge
of liberalism with its great tradition is to defend the status
quo and to push forward the children again as hostages.  The body
count of those children over the last 30 years is enormous.  They're
stacked up like soldiers were at Cold Harbor.  But liberals' last
refuge is to go at it again.  It is a third charge at Cold Harbor,
and at least the folks who defend the status quo could have the
decency to sew the name tags on the backs of those children.
<p>
<center><h3>THE COMPASSION DEFICIT</h3></center>
<p>
As you can see, I'm not fond of what passes for the Democratic
position these days.  But I can give only one or two cheers for
the Republican position because conservatives have not really
taken advantage so far of the opportunities to replace welfare
that have been created by the failure of liberalism.  Many conservatives
are still content to be the party of hardheadedness and, in perception
and sometimes reality, hardheartedness as well.  They tend to
say, &quot;Okay, we're hard.  We have hard heads.  Maybe we have
hard hearts, but you folks on the other side have soft heads and
soft hearts, and when it comes right down to it the voters will
prefer hard-hard to soft-soft.&quot;  Well, maybe they're right
politically.  I tend to think not.  I don't think they'll be successful
in retaining public confidence long enough to really end the budget
deficit if they do not deal with the compassion deficit.  And
that's something the Republicans have not really dealt with yet
for the most part.  Maybe they can get away with it politically,
hard-hard versus soft-soft, but what's right and what the American
people want are folks who are warmhearted but tough-minded.  People
want that combination, and so far neither party has really been
producing it as its main position.  And so, conservatives need
to realize that cost is not the main reason at all to fight governmental
welfare programs.  It's a factor certainly.  It becomes a huge
tax burden for middle-class taxpayers, for example.  But the real
fundamental problem is that we're too stingy in what's truly important:
treating people as human beings made in God's image, not as animals
to be fed, caged and occasionally petted.
<p>
The real need is for leaders who are tough-minded, but also tenderhearted.
And willing to recognize the creation of people in God's image
and the need to treat people that way -- not just looking at it
through green eyeshades as a budgetary matter.  There are some
conservatives who've realized that.  There are some who understand
that.  Newt Gingrich does.  He's getting terrible press these
days.  He's gotten hard press all year, but he understands this.
Bill Bennett understands this.  There are some senators -- Dan
Coats, John Ashcroft, Rick Santorum -- who understand this.  There
are some members of Congress, and some governors I've met in my
travels around the country this year: George Allen, Kirk Fordice,
Fife Symington, and John Engler.  I think they have a sense of
this, and it's starting to come out in the way they speak.  It's
starting to come out in the types of legislation that they may
be moving through their states.  The critical understanding here
is that private programs that are challenging, personal, and spiritual
can do a better job than these failed governmental programs and
that people who are really concerned with helping the poor and
protecting children should not be doing any more to defend this
failed status quo.
<p>
Until that becomes the common understanding and message, until
liberals are ready to move away from the status quo, until conservatives
are ready to understand that it's not primarily a budgetary matter
-- that it's a matter of dreams and not just dollars -- then poor
people will stay on the welfare plantation and folks who want
to misuse the word &quot;compassion&quot; to derive political
capital will still get away with it.  At this point, it's hard
to say what's going to happen with this year's welfare bill. 
It may go down.  It's hard to predict from one moment to the next
what President Clinton will do.  I'm not sure he himself knows.
And so there's a lot of bad news these days.  But when you get
around the country, outside Washington, there's absolutely no
reason to be in social or political despair.  Why?  Because both
history and the present-day efforts represented by many people
here in this room show us the alternative to either softheadedness
or hardheartedness.  And that's what I want to emphasize right
now: the positive alternatives.  There is a way that good things
can come out of this year's effort, despite the failure of both
political parties to approach the question adequately.
<p>
<center><h3>UNDERSTANDING HISTORY</h3></center>
<p>
Let me just mention quickly the history.  After all, the reason
I'm speaking to you today is because I spent a year in the bowels
of the Library of Congress searching through old records.  I became
a witness to what the predecessors of many folks here in this
room, striving so diligently, accomplished.  I can testify to
all these folks whom the standard history books have forgotten.
And if you had history courses in high school or college, I suspect
that you've never heard of some of these people whom I'll refer
to today.  And there are lots more who are great heroes of faith
in practice.
<p>
Men like Charles Brace.  Here's a guy who over a 40-year period,
from 1850 to 1890, built lodging homes in New York City that provided
shelter to several hundred thousand abandoned children.  Over
the years, he placed 91,000 children in adoptive homes.  This
was his life.  This was his career.  This was his calling, and
he performed it wonderfully.
<p>
Women like Helen Mercy Woods.  From 1881 to 1903, she ran a shelter
in Chicago for pregnant and unmarried women.  Month after month
she gave personal attention to each newcomer.  She rejoiced as
their babies were born.  She helped some of her charges get married,
others to place their children for adoption, some to get jobs.
She kept at it year after year, as many people in this room have
kept at it year after year.
<p>
I can testify about some other forgotten heroes and heroines.
Annie Richardson Kennedy.  She ran a home for unwed moms in New
York City between 1900 and 1920.  Her goal was, first, to bring
the girls in touch with their Savior and then to build character.
She provided love and opportunity for thousands, and then she
disappeared into the fog of history.  My wife doesn't mind when
I fall in love with women like Helen Mercy Woods or Annie Richardson
Kennedy.  They've all been dead for a long time.  The text books
are silent.  They've been forgotten, and I want to testify to
the contributions they made.
<p>
They're part of a larger story that none of us learned about in
high school or college.  During the 19th century, before the federal
government ever got involved, there was a war on poverty that
was far, far more successful than our own -- especially considering
the degree of difficulty they had, considering that America was
a much poorer nation a hundred years ago than it is today.  It
was a war waged by tens of thousands of local, private charitable
agencies and religious groups around the country.  It was successful,
not because they abolished poverty, but because they witnessed
movement out of poverty by millions of people.  It was successful
because there were springs of fresh water flowing among the poor,
not just blocks of ice sitting in a perpetual winter of multi-generational
welfare dependency, always winter and never Christmas.  It was
successful because the optimism that was prevalent then contrasts
so sharply with the demoralization among the poor and the cynicism
among the better off that's so common now.  I can testify that
there was a great cloud of witnesses to effective poverty-fighting.
They succeeded in large ways by knowing and doing small but vital
things.
<p>
They knew first of all that the literal meaning of &quot;compassion&quot;
is not just writing a check, but having personal involvement with
the needy -- &quot;suffering with them.&quot;  That's what &quot;compassion&quot;
means: suffering with people, not just giving to them.  The poverty-fighters
of old knew that welfare doesn't mean passing a bill, but helping
a person to fare well.  These are some simple, elementary things
that our legislators seem to have forgotten.  The older generation
knew that people should be challenged.  When an able-bodied man
came to a homeless shelter, for example, he often was asked to
chop wood for an hour or two.  Or maybe whitewash the wall of
a building.  That way he could provide part of his own support
and also help those unable to chop.  They knew.  They demonstrated
through those work tests that even the most run-down person is
not just a taker.  He can also be a giver.  They knew that everyone
is made in God's image and is capable of helping.  Why have so
many people forgotten that?  Well, we don't know much about history.
<p>
History has taught us what to avoid.  Those poverty-fighters warned
us.  I'll give you just a few of their warnings, amazingly prophetic.
Mary Richmond, one of my heroines from the Baltimore Charity
Organizing Society in 1897:  &quot;Relief given without reference
to friends and neighbors is accompanied by moral loss.  Poor neighborhoods
are doomed to grow poorer whenever the natural ties of neighborliness
are weakened by well-meant but unintelligent interference.&quot;
<p>
Carl Herrick is here from the Daylight Foundation in Louisiana,
trying to get some good stuff going there.  Well, the New Orleans
Charity Organization Society in 1899 wisely noted that  &quot;intelligent
giving and intelligent withholding are alike to charity.  Giving
money to a poor person by itself is morally neutral.  The action
can hurt if not done wisely.  If done well with discernment, it's
the best thing in the world.  If done poorly, you're only helping
a person continue on the path of destruction.&quot;
<p>
And New York charity leader Josephine Lowell:  &quot;The problem
before those who'd be charitable is not how to deal with the given
number of the poor.  It's how to help those who are poor without
adding to their numbers and constantly increasing the evils they
seek to cure.&quot;
<p>
They were very forceful.  I'll give you one more quotation here:
&quot;It's important to reform those mild, well-meaning, tenderhearted,
sweet-voiced criminals who insist upon indulging in indiscriminate
charity.&quot;  Well, they were prophetic.  But we don't know
much about history.  We've forgotten America's past successes
in poverty-fighting, and the result has been the waste of not
just billions of dollars each year but the death of part of the
American dream.
<p>
<center><h3>THE CHALLENGE OF REAL COMPASSION</h3></center>
<p>
Now let me take a moment to mention this.  This is something that
some members of the Congress, I think, understand very well. 
But others need to just drop the green eye-shades and get into
real people, real lives, real dreams, and not just the dollars.
The critical part, the essential problem of the welfare system
now, is that sometimes it succeeds in keeping people fed.  But
it kills dreams.
<p>
It kills the helping dream of many Americans.  You know, most
of you, that millions of other people would like to be generous
at the entrance to the Metro here in Washington or at street corners
in your own towns.  But if you know, and there have been studies
showing this, that most homeless recipients will use any available
funds for drugs or alcohol, the tendency is to end up walking
by, avoiding eye contact.  And there's a subtle hardening that
occurs once more.
<p>
Welfare also kills the dreams of social workers.  A lot of conservatives
sometimes talk as if social workers are our enemies.  Not so at
all.  For the most part, these are extraordinarily well-intentioned
people.  The common lament they have is, &quot;All we have time
to do is move paper.&quot;  Here's a comment from a young social
worker who had the calling, who worked at it for a couple of years
and then just couldn't do it anymore.  He said, &quot;I had a
calling.  It was that simple.  I wanted to help.&quot;  And then
he resigned.  Frustrated and worn down, burned out, realizing
that he just wasn't doing any good.
<p>
And then there are some conservatives who talk as if the enemy
is poor individuals themselves.  Again, for the most part, not
so at all.  Welfare kills dreams among poor individuals who gradually
become used to dependency.  The worst thing for children is the
fatalism that often sets in.  And we've seen this, and there are
studies that show, that after a generation or especially two generations
of welfare there is a sense of, &quot;Whatever I do, it's not
going to do any good.  My mom was this way.  I'm going to be this
way.  Probably my children are going to be this way.&quot;  It
just goes on and on and on.  A fatalism.
<p>
Children need challenge.  Kids need a sense of opportunity.  They
don't get that in the welfare system.  And, in fact, they see
that adults who sacrifice leisure time and work hard to remain
independent are often called chumps rather than champs.  It kills
the dreams among children who grow up without fathers.  Those
of you who've coached a Little League team know this.  If there
were kids without fathers there, you knew.  You can tell who's
in that situation.  They alternately cling and show standoffishness
in a way that kids with functioning dads don't.  And it breaks
your heart.  So welfare kills.
<p>
A couple of weeks ago, I spent some time in south central Los
Angeles talking with some welfare moms there who told me about
-- here's an expression I didn't  know before -- 
&quot;county-check-pillow-pimps.&quot;
That's the expression they use.  Guys who come in on the last
day of the month.  They're called &quot;county checks&quot; because
in California you get the welfare check through the county.  Guys
come in on the last day of the month, they spend the night, they
get part of the welfare check that comes from the county the next
day.  So welfare has deprived kids of fathers, and it has deprived
women of husbands.  And I'm not saying that welfare is the cause,
but it certainly is an enabler.  Instead of helping to ennoble
people in poverty, helping them to fight, welfare tells people
to give in.  It enables them to stay in it.  And it kills.
<p>
Welfare packs a theological as well as a cultural punch.  After
all, how do children understand the nature of God the Father?
How do wives understand that Christ is the good husband for His
bride, the church, when they have no experience?  They've had
no experience at all with good fathers or good husbands, and they
don't know anyone who has in their whole block.
<p>
So Washington conservatives need to spend more time with folks,
poor people who are striving to get out of welfare.  If more people
actually walked the mean streets a little bit, they'd come to
understand this crucial point.  The reason to fight these governmental
welfare programs is not because they're too expensive, but because
they're inevitably too stingy in what is truly important: treating
people as human beings made in God's image, not as animals.
<p>
<center><h3>RECOVERING THE LOST TOOLS OF CHARITY</h3></center>
<p>
But again, no reason to despair.  There is good news around the
country.  Folks here in this room who are doing it know it.  We
are recovering the lost tools of charitable success.  We're seeing
a new great cloud of witnesses emerge.  We're living in an era
with many heroes, or, I should say, ordinary people who become
heroic as they show through hard &quot;suffering-with&quot; that
the American dream of compassion is not dead.  I don't know whether
John Perkins was heroic 30 years ago.  I've read his autobiography,
and I guess that he was heroic.  But he has grown in stature,
I suspect, over these years.  He has grown in grace and the knowledge
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  You continue to grow and
develop.
<p>
There are other people I've met who, when they started out in
their ministries, were really folks you would not consider to
be charismatic individuals at all.  They've become so over the
years.  They've learned.  They've grown.  One example.  A friend
of mine now, Bob Cote in Denver.  He's a tall, white ex-boxer.
He spent a year on the streets as an alcoholic in the early '80s.
Then he pulled together a few of his fellow winos and junkies
to start a homeless shelter, a program in Denver that's known
as Step 13.  Bob showed me around his four-story building -- he'd
be glad to give you a tour if you're in Denver sometime.  He showed
me how mostly dead people from off the streets can step-by-step
come back to life.  They can get jobs with increasing responsibility.
They can get rooms within that building that gradually reflect
greater independence.  They go from a big dormitory, to kind of
an alcove, to separate rooms with a lock on the door.  And they're
buying their own furniture and getting their own phone accounts,
and they're ready to step out and lead independent, responsible
lives.  It's a tough, time-intensive process, but Bob Cote has
been there himself.  He's there to help others.
<p>
A person right here in Washington, Hannah Hawkins, who lives down
in Anacostia.  A great person to visit.  She's short, black and
retired, but she voluntarily runs an after-school program that
has several dozen children doing their homework, receiving the
love they often don't get at home.  You go down there and sometimes
it's wild.  Sometimes those kids run around like lost sheep, but
she knows each one of her lambs by name.  It's challenging, it's
personal, it's spiritual.
<p>
I wish you'd come with me and visit Freddy Garcia in San Antonio.
He's a softhearted but hardheaded Hispanic ex-addict.  He formed
Victory Outreach some 30 years ago in San Antonio to help substance
abusers.  Groups based on his teaching now have spread throughout
Texas to California, even as far south as Peru.  I've sat in his
home this year.  I've watched the way he patiently counsels and
teaches those whom everyone else has abandoned.
<p>
This has been a good year for me, with all the travel and hubbub
and so forth.  I've really been blessed to see and come to know
some of these people.  And I'm here to testify that they succeeded,
and they're still succeeding and others can too.  They have the
common understanding.  They picked it up somewhere, somehow, that
in order to be effective, compassion must be challenging, personal
and spiritual.  CPS for short.  Just like CPR can bring back to
life a dying person, CPS can bring back to life that dying American
dream.
<p>
Again, if you're not familiar with some of these places, go and
visit.  Go down about a mile away to Clean and Sober Streets here
in Washington or the Gospel Mission with Reverend Woods.  At Clean
and Sober Streets, it's interesting that there are really tough
rules just as there are at the Gospel Mission.  One strike, you're
out.  There is compassion that is challenging, personal, and spiritual
at the Right Alternative Center in Milwaukee.  This is something
that Bill Schambra from the Bradley Foundation knows about well,
and has helped quite a bit.  People sometimes say that AFDC moms
will be stuck on the government rolls for a lifetime.  You go
there and you talk with the folks, and you will learn that the
moms there take a 13-part pledge.  They pledge to change their
own behavior.  Not to swear, not to shack up, not to do drugs.
And the leaders there challenge them to stick to their pledges.
And when they do, their lives change.  Some of them get married,
some of them get jobs, they run their households better, their
kids start doing better in school, the kids break out of their
fatalism.  That's the key enemy: not poverty, but fatalism.
<p>
There's compassion of that sort at the Union Gospel Mission in
Portland, the Disabled Businesspersons Association in San Diego,
and the Resources, Inc. program in Brooklyn -- the Samaritan Award
winners who are here today.  I've read their reports.  Challenging,
personal, spiritual.  Not easy.  Not easy at all, but possible.
<p>
I have personally seen some successes over the years.  I've seen
lives of pregnant, unmarried women turned around.  I've seen abandoned
children happily adopted.  I've seen failures.  Recently, I was
working with a homeless ex-con.  I thought that he was making
good progress, but now he has slipped back into irresponsibility.
He's in jail right now.  He's having a hearing next week.  Maybe
he'll get out and have another start.  I sent him over to the
most challenging shelter in Austin, Texas the same day I sent
my oldest son to college.  But my homeless friend, Fred, just
lasted three days at the shelter, and then he went back out on
the streets and is now in jail.  My son is still at the University
of Texas.
<p>
So, it's not easy, but it is possible.  People do change.  God
changed me.  He moved me out of the Marxism that I adhered to
25 years ago.  He brought me to a knowledge of Christ, and I'm
thankful to Him.  Other people can change.  You see it all the
time, and there's lots of experience in the room testifying to
that as well.
<p>
<center><h3>TOWARD A THEOLOGY OF CHARITY</h3></center>
<p>
But in order to really have confidence that this change can occur,
we have to do a couple of things.  And they're not primarily political.
The first thing we have to do is just awaken ourselves theologically
and put God's principles to work.  Only after that do we have
to start working on some public policy matters.
<p>
There is a lot of false gospel that's being offered now.  There
are those on the religious left who say that the Bible mandates
the government transfers of resources to the poor on the grounds
of, for example, Jesus' statement, &quot;Whatever you did to the
least of these, brethren, you did to Me.&quot;  Now I take that
verse very seriously.  But before we blindly use it to justify
the welfare state, we need to ask who are the least of these in
America?  What kind of help is real help?  Certainly, children
threatened with death before birth by abortion are among the least
of these, and I would love for all of the groups on the Christian
left that have been proclaiming so vociferously their love for
the unwanted, the poor, and the neglected to really work hard
on abortion.  Women abandoned by their husbands, children who
grow up without fathers.  They also have it very rough and the
concern should be: How do you give them hope?  How do you break
out of that fatalism?
<p>
But what about able-bodied homeless men?  One of the prime changes
in the welfare legislation that is chugging through Congress,
shortly to hit President Clinton's desk, is a cut (actually a
real cut) in aid to homeless men who are addicts or alcoholics.
Here's a hard case.  Here's something that I think obviously
should be changed.  Does irresponsibility qualify a person for
the ranks of the least of these?  Jesus does not include in his
list of commended charitable acts, &quot;When I was strung out,
you gave me dope.&quot;  If we take seriously Christ's words in
Matthew 25, &quot;Whatever you did to the least of these, my brethren,
you did to Me,&quot; then giving money that goes for drugs is
akin to sticking heroin into Jesus' veins.  So rather than proclaiming
the dire effect of cuts generally -- instead of rushing into the
guns at Cold Harbor -- why not accurately and carefully look at
some of these measures and say, &quot;Aha, this is something that
really should be cut&quot;?  Instead, we're not really getting
to that level of specific detail.  Instead, we're just hearing
the blanket condemnations of any movement away from the status
quo as if anything at all, any change at all, is an indication
of hardheartedness.
<p>
Well, if we straighten out the theology, the practice follows.
When I was a Marxist, I believed in top-down approaches, emphasizing
government redistribution.  But as a Christian, I understand that
change comes one by one from the inside out.  Straighten out the
theology of those who are rich, and there will be a tremendous
expansion of effective compassion.  Straighten out the theology
of those who are economically poor because of poor values, and
their attitudes and behaviors will change.  And they will make
progress.  So the essence here is revival and reformation among
both rich and poor.  That will transform American poverty-fighting.
There would be such an outpouring of private charity, if we had
that revival and reformation, that governmental programs could
rapidly be replaced.  We would not even have to debate the question
of tax credits for charitable contributions.
<p>
<center><h3>PUBLIC POLICY, POVERTY, AND THE PREAMBLE</h3></center>
<p>
But while we can hope and pray for revival and reformation, it's
not something that we can count on.  And so here we do come to
questions of public policy.  I'd suggest that a firm distinction
that needs to be made is the constitutional distinction between
&quot;providing&quot; and &quot;promoting.&quot;  The Constitution
talks about &quot;providing&quot; for the common defense, but
&quot;promoting&quot; the general welfare.  There's such a huge
difference between, say, renting a hall for a convention and manning
every booth in that hall yourself.  That's the difference between
providing and promoting.  We're in the mess we're in right now
because the government has attempted to provide welfare, and instead
it has given us entitlements and bureaucracy.  There's a legitimate
role for government, promoting the general welfare, but not providing.
<p>
That's where we come to this question of tax credits on either
a state or national level.  Frankly, I'd rather see it done on
a state-by-state level because we don't know exactly what the
best tax credit mechanism is.  The best way will promote discerning
giving on the part of individuals while avoiding government entanglement
with religious and other charities as much as possible.  We don't
know whether a hundred percent tax credit is absolutely the best
thing, or whether a 90 percent tax credit would generate just
about the same amount of income for private and church charities.
But a 90 percent tax credit would encourage considerably more
discernment on the part of givers because they'd be putting up,
let's say, a hundred dollars of their own money on a thousand
dollar contribution.  They might think a little more seriously
about where it's going.
<p>
I'm also worried about credits without any personal involvement.
It would be much better if we could offer tax credits only to
the individuals who also spend some time at the charities to which
they are giving.  The bookkeeping in that may be too complicated.
It may not work.  But I'd actually prefer to see things go on
a state-by-state basis so we would have some experiments.  Tax
credits, I think, are a very good idea.  And the constitutional
questions of interference with religious groups can be resolved.
If you have a coalition strong enough to pass tax credits, you
have a coalition strong enough to protect religious groups from
federal interference.
<p>
There is no reason, in fact, why you can't have a national approach
and state approaches at the same time, trying out different things
over these next few years to see what will best promote community-based,
poverty-fighting charities.  What I don't understand is why some
of the big philanthropic and charitable groups are not getting
on the team for tax measures to encourage giving.  You'd think
that they would be eager for such a reform, or else they're just
in the position of saying &quot;no, no, no&quot; to any change,
more and more vehemently.  I'd challenge those big charities like
Catholic Charities, but others also.  Why don't they propose something
positive instead of defending to the death a failed status quo?
If their concern is adequate funding for poverty programs, why
not tax credits?  Or else you have to start raising the question:
Are they more concerned about the poor, or about holding on to
their own power?  I'm not sure.  Everyone I've met from those
organizations is well-intentioned, but they've grown so used to
kissing up to government officials instead of going to individual
taxpayers and making the case to them that they deserve support.
Well, I don't know, but it's a problem.  It's a sad state of
affairs.
<p>
There are people who say, well, any other alternative just simply
will not work.  I was reading the other day about the case of
a student of management named Fred Smith, who went on to found
Federal Express.  And he described, in a term paper, his idea
for a reliable overnight delivery service.  His professor gave
him a &quot;C&quot; and explained that the concept was interesting
and well-formed.  &quot;But in order to earn better than a 'C,'&quot;
he said, &quot;the idea must be feasible.&quot;  Charity tax credit
proposals are feasible.  We need to experiment a little bit, but
we need to fight for them.  And we need to push the big philanthropies
and the big philanthropic trade organizations like Independent
Sector and the Council on Foundations to support them also.
<p>
This public policy stuff is important, but the tendency -- especially
here in Washington -- is to fall into the trap of thinking that
a particular piece of legislation is the solution.  Charity tax
credits are a great mechanism to take money off the top of the
governmental superstructure and stick it back on the bottom in
private and religious charities where it can do the most good.
But it's still just a mechanism.  The more time I spend in Washington,
the more I feel as if I'm reading from a manual for medical emergencies
put together by people whose goals exceed their wisdom.  This
is like a recommendation from a student in a junior high school
science class for a nose bleed: Put the nose much lower than the
body until the heart stops.
<p>
The public policy change is essential, but we can't wait for that.
Again, I am somewhat aghast at the thought of mentioning this
to some of you who have done so much over the years.  You know
the answer to this question very well because you've lived it.
But the question is: How does each of us individually help children
and adults now one by one?  How do we create models for the way
the entire welfare system can be transformed and replaced?  What
first steps can those of us in this room take?
<p>
<center><h3>TAKING FIRST STEPS</h3></center>
<p>
Especially in this group, I'm nervous about mentioning any of
the things that my wife and I have been involved in, but they've
been educational for us.  And again, as a number of you who know
me know, I am not always the most diplomatic person around.  Frederica
Mathewes-Green knows.  She is one of our national correspondents
at <I>World</I> magazine, and so she and I discuss editorial matters
and stories occasionally.  I want to be kind of a hard-nosed editor
at times, and so I tend not to be the nicest guy around.  My wife
is a much better person than I am in that regard.  But I tend
to think, okay, as bullheaded as I am, I have been able with my
wife to give a room in our home to needy individuals, to coach
kids in baseball, to tutor children, to mentor some folks, and
to adopt a child.  If I -- not a particularly hospitable individual,
a guy who would rather spend time in the bowels of the Library
of Congress than actually helping someone directly -- if I once
and awhile can do something a little bit decent, why can't people
with much greater merits, with much greater abilities and niceness
and goodness, do the same or even much more?
<p>
I know that many of you already give of yourselves a lot.  Can
you do even more?  Again, some of you I know are just working
already to the max.  Some of you have not probably been involved
with the poor at all.  Will you take a first step?  Just think
for a moment.  If I were a liberal, I would want you to close
your eyes and visualize world peace.  As it is, I want you to
visualize in your mind's eye one poor person whom you have directly,
personally helped during the past year.  A lot of you, I'm sure,
can do that and can probably visualize lots and lots of people.
If you don't see anyone, I pray that you'll take a small step
during 1996, and maybe then even a larger one: tutoring a child
for one hour a week, being a big brother or big sister, or Little
League coach, mentoring an adult who's gotten in trouble, providing
Biblical counsel to a young, unmarried pregnant woman, maybe giving
her a room in your home, maybe adopting a child.  Those steps
are hard, but we're surrounded.  We are just so surrounded by
a great cloud of witnesses, men and women like ourselves who have
taken first steps and then many more.  This is what I have learned
by going around the country this year.
<p>
Remember chapters 11 and 12 of Hebrews talking about the great
cloud of witnesses?  Hebrews 12:1 says, &quot;Therefore, since
we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside
every weight.  Let us run with patience the race that is set before
us.&quot;  Let's work theologically, let's work politically, let's
work personally.  As we work and pray, let's remember that 2,000
years ago Jesus Christ came into the world to suffer with us,
to die for us, and in this year of our Lord 1995 it is such a
great blessing to see godly people who follow in His steps.
<p>
It was six years ago, just before Christmas 1989, that I began
trying in my own real small way to resurrect the word &quot;compassion&quot;
among conservatives and to promote some compassionate alternatives
to failed welfare programs.  I gave a talk six years ago at the
Heritage Foundation, and I just ran across a copy in my files
a couple of days ago while thinking about what I would say here
today.  I gave it at the time when I was in the middle of my historical
research at the Library of Congress.  But it still seems relevant
to me, and I haven't talked about this for a long time.  Let me
just read the ending of that talk:
<p>
<blockquote><i>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.  A time when 
God came to earth to teach, to suffer, and to save by suffering. 
A generation ago, Whittaker Chambers wrote that 'suffering is
at the heart of every living faith.  That is why a man can scarcely
call himself a Christian for whom the crucifixion is not a daily
suffering.'  Chambers knew that Christianity is rooted in suffering.
I would add 'suffering with.'  But he recognized that the meaning
of the faith 'has been blurred as Christianity, in common with
the voices of a new age, seeks new escapes from the problem of
suffering.  Nothing is more characteristic of this age than its
obsession with an avoidance of suffering.'  Are we in America,
and conservatives especially, serious people?  Frankly, I do not
always know whether I am.  I do not know whether you are.  I hope
we are.  I pray that we are, but I do not know.  I do not know,
but finding out is the challenge of the 1990s for the conservative
movement.</i></blockquote>
<p>
That was what I was saying in 1989.  Now it's 1995, and we've
made some progress.  The battle for the word &quot;compassion,&quot;
the understanding of compassion, is now on.  But the body count
is growing.  Those bodies that are Cold Harbors all over the inner
cities of this country are just piling up.  And the defenders
of this status quo are tenacious.  At least we're in the fight.
It's hard, but it's glorious.  I've been glad to be fighting
alongside a lot of you this year.  And I pray that that will continue
and that we will overcome with God's grace.
<p>
Thank you very much.

<title>RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION AROUND THE WORLD</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION<br>
AROUND THE WORLD</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Testimony of Martin J. Dannenfelser, Jr.<br>
Assistant to the President for Government Relations<br>
Family Research Council<br>
before the House Committee on International Relations<br>
Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights<br>
February 15, 1996</h4></center>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I would like to express the apology
of our president, Gary Bauer, for being unable to testify. He
did intend to be here. He wanted to thank you for your leadership
on this issue and to express that apology.

<p>

Mr. Chairman, it is truly ironic that some of the world's biggest
problems fail to attract the notice they deserve. That is the
message we get on the global problem of anti-Christian persecution.
That persecution is growing, both in frequency and in cruelty.
We are appalled at the lack of concern and public attention being
paid to the hidden horror of anti-Christian persecution.

<p>

This persecution takes many forms. Under predominantly Islamic
and former Communist governments, Bibles and religious services
are being banned, missionaries and converts are being imprisoned,
and in Ethiopia believers are actually being crucified. One of
our staff members, Rosanne Dupras, was a volunteer worker overseas
for seven years and has traveled extensively throughout Asia.
She has witnessed the persecution of individuals because of their
religious faith. For example, India is hailed as the world's largest
democracy, with a population of almost 1 billion people. Eighty-five
percent are Hindu, 12 percent Muslim, and 1-2 percent are Christian.
Although the national government describes itself as a secular
democracy with freedom of religion for all -- the government has
taken a less-than-tangible approach to the outcries of persecution.

<p>

Miss Dupras recalls how Sunil, a native of India and a Christian,
was jailed, harassed, stripped naked and interrogated for an endless
number of hours. The compound where he lived was vandalized. He
was slandered and vilified in the local press by persecutors who
included police officials, government intelligence agents, as
well as radical Hindu fundamentalists. The state government participated
in and initiated many of the attacks -- the federal government simply 
turned a blind eye. Atrocities like this occur frequently in 
nation-states that give lip-service to freedom of religion while 
persecuting any deviance from their own ideology of religion.

<p>

Allow me to clarify that this persecution extends beyond Christianity
to include other faiths, although persecution of Christians seems
to be the most widespread. In Ayodhya, Miss Dupras reports that
Hindu groups slaughtered Muslims as the police watched and in
Bombay the police themselves were the ones who massacred Muslims.
A young Muslim Bengali woman in Bangladesh had to flee for her
life after writing a book which was sympathetic to Hindus rather
than to Muslims. She is still hiding somewhere in the West.

<p>

So far, the U.S. Government has largely turned a deaf ear to this
rising tide of terrorism and these human rights violations. Saudi
Arabia, our recent ally in the Gulf War, has pressured the U.S.
on two fronts. The first was to close a U.S.-sponsored nightclub
frequented by American servicemen in Saudi Arabia. Our government
said &quot;No way!&quot; to closing it. The Saudis also demanded
that we stop Sunday worship services at our embassy. To this,
we buckled under. In Turkey, the U.S. has turned a blind eye as
Turkish officials forcibly returned Christian refugees to the
clutches of Iran.

<p>

On January 15, 1996, <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> reported,
&quot;China's religious authorities ordered all places of worship
to register with the government in what may be the beginning of
a new crackdown on religion.&quot;[1] A Mona Charen column elaborated:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

. . . persecution is commonplace in China, where only a fraction
of the estimated 30 million to 70 million Christians belong to
government-approved sects. Amnesty International reports cases
of Christian women hung by their thumbs from wires and beaten
with heavy rods, denied food and water, and shocked with electric
probes.[2]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Ms. Charen's column described the following abuses under Sudan's
Islamic government:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

many of the black Sudanese in the southern part of the country
(the north is Arab) have resisted conversion, in many cases because
of adherence to Christianity . . . As punishment, the Sudanese
government has denied food and medicine to Christians in famine
areas and has sold thousands of Christian children -- some as
young as 6 -- into slavery.[3]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Tolerating episodes such as these conflicts not only with the
inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
in our own Declaration of Independence but even those basic human
rights universally accepted. These rights include, under the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights: the right to life, liberty and security
of person (Article 3); freedom from slavery or servitude in all
their forms (Article 4); freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman
or degrading treatment or punishment (Article 5); equal protection
of the law without any discrimination (Article 7); the right to
freedom of thought, conscience and religion; freedom to change
his religion or belief and to manifest his religion or belief
in teaching, practice, worship and observance (Article 18); freedom
of opinion and expression (Article 19); and the freedom of peaceful
assembly and association without compulsion to belong to a particular
association (Article 20). Christian persecution is a gross violation
of human rights.

<p>

In the United States, an historical example of our defense of
religious minority rights abroad is the 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment,
which made Jewish emigration a condition for aid to the Soviet
Union.[4] Title 22 of the United States Code Service contains the
following passage:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The Congress declares that the individual liberties, economic
prosperity, and security of the people of the United States are
best sustained and enhanced in a community of nations which respect
individual civil and economic rights and freedoms... Furthermore,
the Congress reaffirms the traditional humanitarian ideals of
the American people...[5]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

The U.S. development cooperation policy emphasizes the encouragement
of development processes in which individual civil and economic
rights are respected and enhanced as one of its four principal
goals. It insists that the &quot;. . . pursuit of these goals
requires that development concerns be fully reflected in United
States foreign policy.&quot;[6] Our policy toward humanitarian violations
is quite clear, and the real tragedy here is the appalling lack
of concern here at home and the lack of action by the administration.

<p>

It's time to end the silence of our President and his administration.
President Clinton must waste no time in addressing the American
people, issuing demarches to offending nations, initiating letters
to Heads of State, and working with the State Department desk
officers in the offending nations. The President's focus should
begin with the most egregious violators such as China, Ethiopia,
and the Sudan. Hopefully, other countries will begin to change
their policies when they see the tangible consequences of their
inhumane actions.

<p>

As a candidate for president in 1992, Bill Clinton criticized
former President George Bush for &quot;coddling dictators&quot;
in his policy toward China. Ironically, it is the Clinton administration
that has now totally decoupled the issues of human rights and
Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status for China. This action
sends a signal that the U.S. Government is prepared to do nothing
more than pay lip service to China's human rights abuses, which
include persecution of Christians, forced abortion, and slave
labor. We call on President Clinton to heed his own advice and
stop coddling persecutors of Christians. The time has come for
rhetoric to be joined with actions and results.

<p>

It's time to end the silence of Congress in decrying these outrageous
violations of freedom of speech. This kind of brutality compels
Congress to action: &quot;Dear Colleague&quot; letters, House
Resolutions, floor speeches, and necessary adjustment in our foreign
economic policy. I strongly suggest an expanded bipartisan coalition
to establish a checklist of conditions required for economic aid
with a commitment to inquire, track, reprimand, and call for sanctions
against violators. Consistent action is demanded in order to stop
the <I>de facto</I> tolerance of such grievous offenses.

<p>

It's also time to end the silence of the citizens and churches
of America. The Family Research Council is committed to doing
our part in educating citizens and churches, and encouraging their
involvement and participation. America as a whole can no longer
remain silent.

<p>

America has an obligation and responsibility to speak out against
manifestations of tyranny and oppression. Indeed, it was our forefathers
who fled to this country for freedom of religion, speech, and
expression. These are values that unite this country, and we should
defend them. The <I>Department of State Bulletin</I> from December,
1984 put it succinctly: &quot;the moral bases of democracy --
the principles of individual rights, freedom of thought and expression,
freedom of religion -- are powerful barriers against those who
seek to impose their will, their ideologies, or other religious
beliefs by force.&quot;[7] If we fail to speak out forthrightly in
defense of the freedoms endowed by our Creator, we will undermine
our nation and the principles it is built upon. It is a central
element of our national heritage to stand up and, as documented
again in a September 1989 <I>Department of State Bulletin,</I>
&quot;stress the protection of freedom of thought, conscience
and religion, and of freedom of opinion and expression; for without
these freedoms, other rights cannot be fully realized.&quot;[8]

<p>

Some argue that they cannot speak up, because it will only tempt
the tyrants to greater cruelty. But history teaches the opposite
lesson. Speaking fearlessly is the only thing that deters tyrants.
The time has come for Americans to demand that our government
act now to stop this unconscionable persecution. Clearly, the
pro-family and religious communities need to be full partners
in the quest to bring an end to the horror of religious persecution.
Failure to do all within our power will sear at our collective
consciences as we hear the anguished voices of our brothers and
sisters overseas who cry out, &quot;Why have you forsaken us?&quot;

<title>THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILIES AND MARRIAGE</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILIES<br>
AND MARRIAGE</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Testimony of Robert H. Knight<br>
before the<br>
Senate Health, Education and Social Services Committee,<br>
State of Alaska<br>
regarding SB 308, which would amend the state's marriage statute<br>
March 18, 1996</h4></center>

Thank you for inviting me to testify on behalf of the Family Research
Council. I've been asked to give a brief statement summarizing
the importance of families and of marriage.

<p>

One of the Family Research Council's functions is that of a clearinghouse
on research about families. Over the years, we have seen studies
pile up to an overwhelming magnitude which show that children
do best in mother-and-father families, and that communities are
healthier where you find the most intact families.

<p>

Likewise, numerous studies show that marriage is a societal good,
leading to more fulfilled, and even longer lives. Typical is a
study in the <I>American Journal of Sociology</I> that finds married
couples have longer lifespans than unmarried people. The authors
conclude that &quot;for both sexes, the hazard of dying falls
significantly with marital duration, suggesting a cumulation of
the benefits of marriage over time.&quot; The researchers say
their findings are hardly surprising: &quot;The relationship between
marriage and death rates has now reached the status of a truism,
having been observed across numerous societies and various social
and demographic groups.&quot;[1]

<p>

The heart of family life is marriage, the key organizing principle
behind all civilization. Marriage, which brings the two sexes
together in a unique legal, social, economic and spiritual union,
has had special protection within the law and the culture because
it is indispensable to civilized life. No other relationship provides
society what marriage does. No other relationship transforms young
men and women into more productive, less selfish and more mature
husbands and wives, and fathers and mothers, than marriage. No
other relationship affords children the best economic, emotional
and psychological environment. Only as we have drifted from
the defense of marriage have we experienced soaring social problems,
such as divorce, illegitimacy, sexually-transmitted diseases,
and crime. The answer is not to push the envelope further but
to restore the primacy of marriage within the law and the culture.

<p>

Over the years, there have been attempts to redefine marriage
outside the one-man, one-woman definition. In the mid-1800s, some
people tried to legalize multiple-partner unions, but were soundly
rebuffed. In fact, the U.S. Supreme Court declared in 1885 that
any prospective state had to have law resting on &quot;the basis
of the idea of the family, as consisting in and springing from
the union for life of one man and one woman in the holy estate
of matrimony; the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble
in our civilization, the best guaranty of that reverent morality
which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political
improvement.&quot; (<I>Murphy v. Ramsey</I>)[2]

<p>

Marriage is not something that can be taken lightly, or altered
without much impact. Same-sex proponents often point out that
some states once banned interracial marriage, but the comparison
is invalid. Skin color is inborn and benign, while sexual behavior
has everything to do with character, morality and society's basic
rules of conduct. Eliminating one entire sex from an institution
defined as the bringing together of the two sexes is a quantum
leap from eliminating racial discrimination, which did not alter
the fundamental character of marriage.

<p>

Marriage reflects the natural moral and social law which is in
evidence all over the world. No society has loosened sexual morality
outside of man-woman marriage and survived. Analyzing studies
of cultures spanning several thousands of years on several continents,
Harvard sociologist Pitirim Sorokin found that virtually all political
revolutions that brought about societal collapse were preceded
by a sexual revolution in which marriage and family were devalued.[3]
When marriage lost its unique status, women and children most
frequently were the direct victims.

<p>

Giving same-sex relationships or out-of-wedlock heterosexual couples
the same special status and benefits as the marital bond would
not be the expansion of a right but the destruction of a principle.
One can no more expand a definition of marriage than one can expand
the definition of a yardstick and still use it as a reliable measure.

<p>

If the one-man, one-woman definition of marriage is broken, there
is no logical stopping point for continuing the assault on marriage.
If feelings are the key requirement, than why not let three people
marry, or two adults and a child, or consenting blood relatives
of legal age?

<p>

Marriage-based kinship is essential to stability and continuity.
A man is far more apt to sacrifice himself to help a bona fide
son-in-law than some unrelated man (or woman) who lives with his
daughter. Kinship imparts family names, heritage and property,
secures the identity and commitment of fathers for the sake of
the children, and entails mutual obligations to the community.
Same-sex relations are a negation of the ties that bind, which
are the continuation of kinship through the procreation of children.

<p>

Even childless married couples retain the possibility of becoming
parents either biologically or through adoption, thus providing
children with role models of both sexes. Marriages benefit more
than the two people involved, or even the children who are created.
Their influence reaches children living nearby, as young minds
seek out clues to appropriate sexual behavior. Deliberately creating
motherless or fatherless families is not remotely in the interests
of children or the community, and benefits only a particular political
agenda.

<p>

Homosexual activist Michaelangelo Signorile put it candidly when
he wrote that activists should &quot;fight for same-sex marriage
and its benefits and then, once granted, redefine the institution
of marriage completely, to demand the right to marry not as a
way of adhering to society's moral codes but rather to debunk
a myth and radically alter an archaic institution....&quot;[4] Likewise,
homosexual activist Tom Stoddard admits that &quot;I am no fan
of marriage&quot; but he sees &quot;gay marriage&quot; as a way
of forcing society to accept homosexuality because marriage &quot;is
the centerpiece of our entire social structure, the core of the
traditional notion of 'family.'&quot;[5] But when homosexuals talk
about marriage and monogamy, they mean something different from
what folks usually mean. Evidence is overwhelming that few gay
couples are stable, and those that are, have an understanding
to have outside sexual contacts. Andrew Sullivan, the homosexual
editor of <I>The New Republic</I>, concedes in his book <I>Virtually
Normal</I> that homosexual relationships are quite different.
He contends that many homosexual households reflect &quot;greater
understanding of the need for extramarital outlets between two
men than between a man and a woman.&quot;

<p>

Clearly, those who care deeply about children, about morality,
about the well being of the larger society, must resist the attempts
by a tiny segment of the population to seize marriage for their
own purposes. The aggressors here are not ordinary people, who
are doing their best to live according to ages-old, time-tested
morality and family definition, but those who are trying to harness
the power of the law to force acceptance of their agenda. Individuals
struggling with same-sex desires should be accorded compassion,
but this does not mean they should be given a mandate to radically
redefine marriage.

<p>

Marriage must be protected, and creating counterfeit versions
would undermine the special status of marriage in the law and
in the culture -- to the detriment of children, families and, finally,
to civilization itself.

<p>

Thank you.

<h2>WELFARE REFORM AND<br>
ILLEGITIMACY</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Written Testimony submitted by Gary L. Bauer<br>
to the<br>
United States House of Representatives<br>
Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources<br>
March 12, 1996</h4></center>

<p>

In the welfare debate last year, President Clinton himself stated
that &quot;the real source of [the] problem is the inordinate
number of out-of-wedlock births in this country.&quot;[1] He also
conceded that &quot;there's no question that [ending welfare for
unwed mothers] would work. The question is... 'Is it morally
right?'&quot;[2]

<p>

While the President's proposed policies leave much to be desired,
he has formulated precisely the right question to frame the current
debate over welfare reform in general and illegitimacy in particular.
There can be no more important policy objective than the preservation
-- or more properly in this day and age, the revitalization --
of our nation's moral capital.  As James Q. Wilson wrote in his
oft-cited article, &quot;The Rediscovery of Character: Private
Virtue and Public Policy&quot;:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The essential first step is to acknowledge that at root, in
almost  every area of  important public concern, we are seeking
to induce  persons to act virtuously....Not only is such conduct
desirable in  its own right, it appears now to be necessary if
large improvements  are to be made in those matters we consider
problems.</i>[3]

</blockquote><p>

There exists a striking public consensus that the welfare state's
practice of subsidizing illegitimacy is not only a massive problem,
but a moral problem at root.

<p>

Even so unlikely a source as Bruce Reed, President Clinton's leading
aide on welfare reform, once acknowledged that the essential purpose
of reform must be to reverse the alarming rise in out-of-wedlock
births.[4] If not driven exclusively by AFDC &quot;benefits,&quot;
the increase has at least been sustained and perpetuated by the
expansion of a system that pays recipients to bear illegitimate
children.  Current trends indicate that by the year 2015 -- some
studies project as early as 2000 -- one of every two American
babies will be born to a single mother, and illegitimacy will
surpass divorce as the main cause of fatherlessness.

<p>

Already, according to the Census Bureau, approximately one of
every three babies born in the United States is born to a single
mother.  In the black inner city, more than 80 percent of children
are born without fathers.  In many poor white communities, the
figure is nearing 50 percent -- and illegitimacy is increasing
more rapidly among whites than any other racial group.  Illegitimacy
ratios for the country's white population have now climbed higher
than the illegitimacy ratios in the black community that compelled
Senator Moynihan to issue his famous warning about the breakdown
of the black family.

<p>

Even if a job program can succeed in putting more unmarried welfare
mothers to work (which is unlikely),[5] we will still be left with
roughly the same number of fatherless children.  While Great Britain
has already succeeded in implementing reforms that make work economically
more attractive than welfare, the reforms of the 1980s have only
served to underscore in both Britain and America the fact that
little progress can be made without addressing the collapse of
the family.[6]

<p>

When the Moynihan Report appeared over thirty years ago, liberal
intellectuals excoriated the author for &quot;defending middle-class
values.&quot;  &quot;What may seem to be a disease to the white
middle class may be a healthy adaptation to the Negro lower class,&quot;
Bayard Rustin intoned.[7] Today, however, overwhelming empirical
evidence demonstrates that there is nothing at all &quot;healthy&quot;
about the decay of families and that not all personal choices
are equal in terms of their impact on children, families, and
communities.  The evidence itself has propelled illegitimacy to
the forefront of the current national debate over welfare reform
-- or at least, <I>had</I> propelled illegitimacy to the forefront
before President Clinton and the Governors signaled their retreat.

<p>

Retreat is inexcusable, for the fact remains that intact families
bestow upon individuals and communities advantages that simply
come no other way.  We cannot repeat too often, in a climate rife
with attempts to seize the moral high ground, that no moral judgment
even need be adduced.  The empirical evidence amassed by social
scientists in the last 10 years (and chronicled by Barbara Dafoe
Whitehead in her April 1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article, &quot;Dan
Quayle Was Right&quot;) has confirmed in exquisite detail what
those who have lived in broken families already know.  A single
woman with children is not a viable economic unit for the vast
majority, but children need biological fathers for much more than
the extra dollars they add to the family budget.  As social scientist
Charles Murray has written, single parenthood is &quot;damaging
to children in so many ways that to list them individually would
be to trivialize them.&quot;[8]

<p>

<I>Children born to single mothers are more likely to experience
abuse or neglect; and they have higher infant mortality rates
and lower birth weights regardless of the age or race of the mother</I>.
The proportion of low birth-weight babies, for example, increases
by 50 percent if the mother is not married.  Dr. Nicholas Eberstadt,
author of &quot;Why Babies Die in D.C.&quot; (<I>The Public Interest,
</I> Spring 1994), observes that &quot;so substantial are the differentials
associated with illegitimacy that an American baby born to a teenage
mother is less likely to register low birth weight if the
mother is married and black than if she is unmarried but white.&quot;[9]
In the early 1980s, black and white babies alike were less likely
to survive the first year of life born to an unmarried college
graduate than to a married high school dropout.[10]

<p>

For those children born out-of-wedlock who do survive, long-term
life prospects are equally discouraging.  According to data from
the National Fatherhood Initiative, only 4.4 percent of children
who live with both parents are expelled or suspended from school.
By contrast, 15.5 percent of fatherless children will be dismissed
or suspended.  Among children living with a never-married mother,
29.7 percent repeat a grade in school as opposed to 11.6 percent
of children overall.  And a 1988 University of Illinois study
of adults born outside of marriage found that the longer the time
spent in a single-parent family, the less education the child
ultimately attained -- regardless of the parent's income level.

<p>

Children born out-of-wedlock also have greater problems with behavioral
development.  The National Survey of Children found that children
from single-parent families are two to three times more likely
to have emotional problems -- three times as likely to find themselves
in psychotherapy.  Lack of self-control is a common failing.

<p>

Not surprisingly, Charles Murray has concluded that &quot;illegitimacy
is the single most important social problem of our time...because
it drives everything else.&quot;[11] According to the Bureau of
Justice Statistics, more than 70 percent of all juveniles in state
reform institutions come from fatherless homes.  Raymond A. Knight
and Robert A. Prentky have reported in the journal <I>Criminal
Justice Behavior</I> that 60 percent of all violent rapists who
were repeat offenders came from single-parent households.  And
a Michigan State University study reported in 1987 in <I>Behavioral
Sciences and the Law</I> found that 75 percent of the adolescent
murderers surveyed had come from homes where the parents were
divorced or never married. <I>The relationship between crime
and one-parent families is so powerful, in fact, that controlling
for family structure erases the relationship between crime and
race and between crime and low income</I>.

<p>

Compounding the cycle of despair, illegitimacy feeds itself too.
Young white women who grow up without a father in the home are
more than twice as likely to bear children out-of-wedlock and
to do so during their teenage years when they are most likely
to form long-term attachments to AFDC.[12] Research by the Heritage
Foundation, based on the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth,
found that young girls raised in single-parent homes in public
housing are roughly five times more likely to bear children out-of-wedlock
themselves than girls raised in two-parent homes.[13]

<p>

If those on the welfare rolls have suffered most conspicuously,
it is also true that the welfare system has corrupted the ideals
and narrowed the vision of many who live well beyond the bounds
of the inner city -- even as it is now threatening our most cherished
civic institutions.  One obvious casualty is the weakening of
our conviction that the so-called &quot;bourgeois virtues&quot;
are available to all, regardless of race or class.  Early American
social workers, like Mary Ellen Richmond, understood the importance
of middle-class norm-setting.  &quot;The way to reintegrate the
deviant into society,&quot; she argued, &quot;is to educate and
indeed direct them toward the shared values of the mainstream
culture.&quot;[14]

<p>

The role of the traditional two-parent family is essential in
sustaining the institutions of a free society precisely because
it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted from generation
to generation.  If the family fails to impart virtues that temper
and restrain behavior, broad legal freedoms must give way.  So,
too, human dignity and equality, as the Founders understood them.
Virtue, historian Gertrude Himmelfarb has said, is the only true
basis of equality and the only requisite for citizenship.[15] As
Charles Murray made clear in his now famous op-ed, &quot;The Coming
White Underclass,&quot; either we act now to reduce illegitimacy
and to reinfuse our public policy with a commitment to higher
and nobler things -- or we run the risk of sabotaging the entire
experiment in democratic self-government.

<p>

Or, as Michael Novak put it:

<p><blockquote>

<i>[T]he project of self-government depends on the capacity of
citizens to govern their own  passions, urges, habits, and expectations.
If they cannot govern their own lives  individually, how can
they be successful in self-government as a republic?  The project
of self-government is moral -- or not at all.</i>[16]

</blockquote><p>

The Founding Fathers and many succeeding generations understood
that only a virtuous people can be free.  Do we?

<p>

Given the consequences for the individual child, the surrounding
community, and the national polity, bringing a baby into this
world without a sense of sacred responsibility cannot long be
regarded as a morally neutral act.  In a report issued in December
1994, the Progressive Policy Institute, policy arm of the Democratic
Leadership Council, joined others in acknowledging that &quot;it
is wrong -- not simply foolish or impractical -- for women and
men to make babies they cannot support emotionally and financially.&quot;[17]
Donna Shalala made the same concession a year earlier, however
reluctantly, when she said in an interview, &quot;I don't like
to put this in moral terms, but I do believe that having children
out-of-wedlock is wrong.&quot;[18]

<p>

Congress should now recognize that it is also wrong to sanction
such activity by subsidizing it.  Republican strategist Bill Kristol
has said that &quot;neither our politics nor our sociology can
ultimately be neutral as to the content of the laws of Nature
and Nature's God,&quot;[19] chief among which is the fact that we
were made to live in families.  Charles Murray asks rhetorically,
&quot;If a social policy that induces people to believe that they
are not responsible for their lives is one that
inhibits the pursuit of happiness and is to that extent immoral[,]
[c]an then a policy that <b>fails</b> to stigmatize be a moral
one?&quot;[20]

<p>

Historical experience, related by Marvin Olasky and others, does
indeed demonstrate that the most effective social services have
been offered by private community groups, without any illusion
of moral neutrality.  In her seminal historical study <I>Poverty
and Compassion</I>, Gertrude Himmelfarb writes that:

<p><blockquote>

<i>[a]fter making the most arduous attempt to objectify the problem
of poverty, to divorce  poverty from any moral assumptions and
conditions, we are learning how inseparable the  moral and material
dimensions of that problem are.  And after trying to devise social
policies that are scrupulously neutral and value-free, we are
finding these policies fraught  with moral implications that have
grave material and social consequences.</i>[21]

</blockquote><p>

George Liebmann says, more simply, in a recent issue of <I>The
American Enterprise</I>, &quot;Rescuing an underclass is by definition
a highly moralistic undertaking.&quot;[22] While controlling welfare
spending is a happy byproduct of terminating benefits to teen
mothers, even more promising is the opportunity to begin reversing
the message of the counterculture that has so eroded the character
of our people, in part by assaulting the family.

<p>

Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has used the phrase &quot;defining
deviancy down&quot; to describe Americans' tendency to ignore
excess levels of deviancy by normalizing what used to be considered
pathology.  Only by &quot;defining deviancy down&quot; have we
been able to ignore until now all the signs of impending disaster
that attend a burgeoning illegitimacy rate.  Barbara Whitehead's
1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article heralded a real and significant change
in the public mood, however; and the near-mythic ascendancy of
Charles Murray's &quot;Coming White Underclass&quot; piece the
same year seemed to confirm a general convergence of public opinion.
In a recent Family Research Council survey of 1,000 Americans,
a substantial majority (81 percent) of respondents indicated that
&quot;women having babies out of wedlock that they can't support
financially&quot; is a serious problem.  The mounting public consensus
presents a unique opportunity to implement more than symbolic
change in the 104th Congress and to make sanctions against illegitimacy
the focus of that change.

<p>

In sending his welfare package to Congress more than 30 years
ago, President Kennedy articulated contemporary liberals' fundamental
misunderstanding of the causal role welfare plays in boosting
illegitimacy rates.  He said:

<p><blockquote>

<i>[W]elfare programs must contribute to the attack on . . . family
breakdown [and]  illegitimacy. . . . Unless such problems are
dealt with effectively, they fester, and grow, sapping the strength
of society as a whole and extending their consequences in troubled
families from one generation to the next.</i>[23]

</blockquote><p>

Kennedy's insight about the consequences has proven historically
accurate, but his &quot;service&quot; approach to curbing illegitimacy
worked no better than the current President's will -- a fact which
an unnamed aide on the Clinton welfare task force acknowledged
last year.

<p>

While the President advocates a massive and expensive public relations
campaign against teen pregnancy, the anonymous aide confided to
<I>Newsweek</I> reporter Joe Klein: &quot;We looked at a hundred
different programs around the country that were trying to deal
with this problem, and not one of them moved the needle.  There
just weren't any results.&quot;[24] Likewise, a formal study of
the Teenage Parent Demonstration, sponsored by the Department
of Health and Human Services in response to &quot;persistently
high rates of teenage pregnancies and births,&quot; found that
&quot;[t]he program had an unusual and disappointing pattern of
impacts on pregnancy and birth rates . . . despite . . . the substantial
efforts of the programs to empower [the] young mothers to take
control of their fertility.&quot;[25]

<p>

Out-of-wedlock births, moreover, remain a strong predictor of
poverty.  A recent U.S. Census Bureau report on poverty found
that the median household income for women householders with no
husband present is only $19,872.  For black Americans, the median
single-parent household -- which now represents the family structure
of 48 percent of all black families -- is less than $12,000 per
year.  Married black families, by contrast, receive a median income
of $45,041.  Both Republican William Bennett and Democrat William
Galston have noted that, according to the Census Bureau, the family
income of black, two-parent families is almost two-and-a-half
times the family income of white single-parent families.  Children
of white, single parents are two-and-a-half times likelier to
be living in poverty than children in black, two-parent families.
Today's major economic indicator, in other words, is family stability
-- not race.

<p>

In a meticulously researched article in the January 6, 1996 issue
of <I>World</I> magazine, Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation
demonstrates that it is neither easy to raise family income through
welfare transfers nor historically true that higher welfare benefits
and broadened eligibility have improved children's life prospects.
It <I>is</I> true, however, that unwed mothers are not only more
likely to rely on government to support their children, but are
also more likely to spend years dependent upon welfare.  Because
illegitimacy feeds both poverty and itself, we cannot reasonably
expect to address welfare dependency until we address illegitimacy.

<p>

Charles Murray anticipated the problem in his 1988 book <I>In
Pursuit of Happiness and Good Government.</I>  &quot;The task,&quot;
he concludes, &quot;is not to devise a public relations campaign
to discourage single teenage girls from having babies, but to
neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings
to form families.&quot;[26] Eliminating grants to unwed teenage
mothers will be necessary, but not sufficient, to restore the
integrity of the family unit.

<p>

The primary argument is <I>not</I> that women have babies just
to get the dollars -- although anecdotal evidence does exist to
suggest that welfare checks can drive fertility directly.  There
is the story of a five-month-old girl named Ariel Hill who was born 
on Christmas Eve 1992 and died a brutal death in May of 1993. She lived 
with her 22-year-old mother and four other siblings in a squalid unit
of public housing.  The family's chief source of income was welfare.
One day, her mother grew tired of her screaming and dumped her
in a sink of scalding water as punishment.  She died, weighing
less than seven pounds.  She had not been fed in days.  When investigators
examined the apartment, they found a scrap of paper with the name
of each child and the dollar amount of welfare that child earned
for the mother.

<p>

In all probability, however, Ariel Hill's mother is an aberration.
The chief concern is simply that welfare <I>enables</I> men and
women to indulge in irresponsible behavior by shielding them from
the natural economic consequences of their actions -- actions
that often do issue in tragic results for the children who are
born of their thoughtlessness.  &quot;By lessening the costs attached
to unwed reproduction,&quot; anthropologist David Murray argues,
&quot;welfare subsidizes choices that interfere with future opportunity.
. . .  A monthly increase in cash is usually not enough to 'cause'
someone to bear a child.  But by increasing the benefits and reducing
the burdens of a choice that is desirable on other grounds, welfare
becomes a catalyst in the timing and frequency of the decision.
How could it be otherwise?&quot;[27] Unless, of course, one assumes
that welfare recipients are less likely to be rational judges
of their own self-interest.

<p>

Fealty to the premise that all individuals are morally autonomous
creatures argues against such a premise.  And the migration of
welfare recipients to states with higher welfare benefits provides
empirical corroboration that welfare mothers are indeed capable
of making rational decisions to govern their own lives.  Welfare
mothers are dependent, we believe, not because they are incompetent
or morally lacking but because they have made rational decisions
in an irrational system.

<p>

Moral concern, informed by empirical evidence, demands admission
that the service approach to both family breakdown and welfare
dependency has failed.  Welfare reform that fails to curb the
cash that subsidizes illegitimacy is not a vision of reducing
dependency, but a vision of administering &quot;benefits&quot;
to an ever-expanding population that will always be mired in dependency.
It is an abandonment of the conviction that people on welfare
are fully human and fully capable of achieving self-sufficiency.
And it is an insidious guarantee that welfare spending will continue
to crawl steadily upward while illegitimacy continues to increase
as well.

<p>

If the amount of money we are spending on welfare were buying
healthy families and stable communities, we would raise no objection.
Our concern is not that we are spending too much, but that we
are killing off marriage and all the blessings and safeguards
marriage buys for women and children.

<p>

Admitting the failure of the service approach will require tough
political choices.  Those choices will undoubtedly offend both
the welfare industry and feminist ideology.  But politicians should
take heart from polling data that demonstrates broad-based public
support for modest but real steps to reduce illegitimacy.

<p>

According to a poll conducted by Voter/Consumer Research for Family
Research Council in mid-October 1995, three out of four Americans
believe welfare encourages illegitimacy.  By a ratio of two to
one, Americans feel that reducing illegitimacy is a more important
-- and more realistic -- goal than &quot;getting single mothers
with few job skills into jobs that will pay them enough to support
themselves and their children.&quot;  Voters favor a preventative,
anti-illegitimacy strategy, in other words, rather than a remedial
workfare strategy.  And by an overwhelming margin of 84 percent
to 13 percent, they favor the family cap provision as a modest
first step toward reversing the trend in illegitimacy.

<p>

Only by historical accident were unwed mothers -- of any age --
ever included in the AFDC program.  Frances Perkins, President
Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor and chief architect of welfare
policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers
because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate
family breakdown.  And, tragically, she was right.  While less
than 3 percent of the young beneficiaries of the program in the
late 1930s were the children of unwed mothers, today the tables
have completely turned.  In the year between October 1991 and
September 1992, only 1.6 percent of the children on AFDC qualified
because a parent was deceased.

<p>

It would be ironic at best if the current majority in Congress
were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal member
of the Roosevelt Administration because they rejected her intuition,
now confirmed by years of sad experience.  It is the potential
to reverse that sad experience that must define &quot;compassion&quot;
in the present debate.  As the one policy option that promises
to effect change in the current system, restrictions on benefits
by definition constitute the compassionate alternative.

<p>

Gertrude Himmelfarb notes that the word &quot;compassion&quot;
once described &quot;a moral sentiment, not a political principle,
a sentiment evoked by misery or sorrow, not by poverty as such.&quot;[28]
As political salvationism sought to preempt traditional morals
in the last 30 years, it was only natural that moral sentiments
should be confused with political principles.  Likewise, that
misery and sorrow should be equated with material poverty; for
the redefinition of compassion required a highly artificial view
of man as no more than a material being.

<p>

If compassion is once again properly understood, perhaps then
it will become more obvious that the object of our concern must
be &quot;misery&quot; and &quot;sorrow,&quot; not economic poverty,
and that the &quot;misery&quot; most evident today is the spiritual 
and moral deprivation visited upon dependents of the welfare system. 
It is time that we stop suppressing the moral responsibilities that 
make life precious for a resident of the inner city just the same as 
for a middle-class suburbanite.  It is time, in short, to secure equal
access to the central satisfactions of family, virtue, and freedom.

<p>

In the end, we will adopt answers by default only because there
is no alternative strategy.  There are two competing alternatives
currently at play to define the future of the welfare state. 
Either we will treat welfare dependents as wards of a custodial
state, and we will spend lavishly to keep them comfortable while
we ask them simply to leave us alone.  Or we can begin relimiting
government and restoring social functions to neighborhoods, communities,
and churches.

<p>

The family cap is a symbolic first attempt to begin reversing
the big-government policies that have proven so obviously destructive
to children and families -- and an important opportunity to begin
dissolving the wall that separates welfare families from middle-class
society.

<p>

We can't afford to wait any longer to act.  Senator Moynihan,
who led the charge against illegitimacy thirty years ago, has
already fallen victim to despair.  While candid about the human
cost of the current system, he argues for the status quo simply
because he believes there is no longer any alternative.  Young
males in the inner city &quot;can be horrid to themselves, horrid
to one another, horrid to the rest of us,&quot; he says.  Dismantle
the current system, and they will be unleashed on the rest of us.

<p>

It seems appropriate to us to subject Moynihan's &quot;containment
policy&quot; to the test President Clinton formulated in the early
days of the welfare debate -- &quot;Is this morally correct?&quot;
We would have to answer &quot;no.&quot;  Surely the underclass
is no less human and no further beyond reclamation than the rest
of us flawed individuals.

<p>

Moynihan also bases his opposition to reform on projections about
the number of children who will be thrown into the streets.  Social
scientist Charles Murray responds that, &quot;like all policy
projections, this analysis reflects a set of assumptions&quot;[29]
-- namely, that limiting welfare will do nothing to change behavior.

<p>

But Father Robert Sirico has noted an interesting demographic
trend that suggests otherwise.  Food stamp rolls have fallen dramatically
-- without any change in underlying economic data.  And the bulk
of the drop occurred since January 1995, when Congress convened
to announce new limits on entitlements.  During the previous four
years, the rolls had steadily swelled, sometimes expanding by
40,000 recipients per week.  Sirico concludes that food stamp
recipients factored in expectations of what the new Congress would
do and acted accordingly.  &quot;Poor people are a lot smarter
than social scientists give them credit for being.  Like everyone
else, they plan ahead, with a view toward a certain amount of
future financial stability, which sometimes leads them to the
want ads and to churches and community organizations,&quot;[30]
he says.

<p>

Political opponents cannot merely claim that Republican reforms
will cause suffering and expect to maintain their credibility.
In addition to thinking creatively about the ways policy affects
human behavior, we also have to come to terms with the degree
of suffering that is occurring now.  Proponents of the status
quo say that only the federal government has the resources to
maintain existing welfare programs.  But perhaps existing welfare
programs should <I>not</I> be maintained precisely because they
have caused so much duress for the children and adults mired in
dependency.  The degree of Senator Moynihan's despair is an argument
that we can do no less than search for a radically different approach
to welfare.  The time to begin is now.

<title>CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</title>

<h2>CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY<br>
DEVELOPMENT</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Dr. John M. Perkins</i></center>

<p>

<i>The following speech was presented at the Family Research Council's
&quot;World Without Welfare&quot; symposium on December 13, 1995
at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C.</i>

<p>

Wayne Gordon and I are going across America in something that
we are calling the American Cities Campaign.  We are taking into
cities across the country the concepts of neighborhood and community
development that have emerged from the church.  I am the chairman
of the Christian Community Development Association, and Wayne
Gordon is the president.  He has spent 20 years in Chicago developing
ministries there.  His great ministry has been building up Lawndale
Community, one of the 15 poorest neighborhoods in America.  Because
of efforts by people like Wayne Gordon, young, indigenous people
-- predominantly black -- are going off to colleges and universities
and returning to their home communities to provide new leadership
for a new generation.

<p>

<center><h3>SUGGESTED RESOURCES</h3></center>

<p>

Wayne Gordon has described his effort in a book called <I>Real
Hope in Chicago</I>.

<p>

The book that best summarizes the philosophy that I will share
with you today, however, is a book called <I>Beyond Charity</I>.
This book outlines how we have been working for the last 35 years
in neighborhood and community development.  And a new textbook
for community development today has just been published under
the title <I>Restoring At-Risk Communities</I>.  I edited the
book, but it was written by practitioners -- people who are a
part of the Christian Community Development Association (CCDA).

<p>

The Christian Community Development Association is made up of
about 4,000 individuals and about 400 organizations.  The purpose
is really not something from the top down; it's something from
the bottom up.  It belongs to the people, one of the things that
motivated me to come here today.  I don't really believe that
major organizations, whether they're government organizations
or national organizations, can implement indigenous leadership and 
produce the kind of motivation and incentive that people need at the 
bottom.

<p>

We do need organizations that affirm the dignity of the people.
The rationale for a national organization ought to be to inspire
those people to take responsibility for their own lives.  Then
we can come along beside them to help them realize their hopes,
goals, and aspirations.  I think you have heard today that our
big federal government is taking that incentive away.  I think
that's what's motivating the movement for welfare reform.  You
can't isolate crime and violence and all these other problems
from the fact that well-intended people are doing things without
believing in the inherent dignity of the individuals being helped.

<p>

The programs that work are those programs in which the initiative
starts first with the people themselves.  Alcoholics Anonymous
is working.  It is working because the individual says &quot;the
problem is mine&quot; and decides to take responsibility for himself.
Then other people come along beside him and help.  Our work should
be to bring about that kind of motivation, incentive, creativity
and the hope that people can do for themselves what they need
to do.  Our newest book, <I>Restoring At-Risk Communities,</I> outlines
strategies for success.

<p>

The last book I want to mention specifically is <I>Resurrecting
Hope</I>.  We have looked at 12 churches in America that have
taken the principles that I am talking about in terms of community
development and have put those principles to work at the grass-roots
level.  There's a West Los Angeles church, for example, that is
the largest black worshipping congregation in the United States.
I worked with that church, and they are in the book.  There is
also Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City, along with
10 other congregations that are doing successful community development
work.

<p>

Finally, we have created <I>Urban Family</I> magazine because
we were concerned about the philosophy of the liberal establishment.
I am not stating that fact to pit liberals against conservatives.
I object to liberalism simply because the system created by the
liberal establishment has made black people think of ourselves
as helpless victims who cannot do much for ourselves -- despite
the fact that people like Booker T. Washington and others came
out of slavery and developed the great institutions of our day.

<p>

We now have all the resources, but we act like victims because
the government has come in and taken the responsibility away from
people.  We fault racism and everything else for all of our problems,
and we never play to our advantages.  And so we created a magazine
called <I>Urban Family</I>. It looks at people in the community
who have taken the initiative and are doing things very creatively,
and it encourages blacks to begin building on our strengths instead
of just compounding our weaknesses and always acting like victims.

<p>

There is no other national Christian magazine that is written
from a black perspective in America.  The voices and the aspirations
of black folks themselves are not being heard -- we hear only
the liberal-victimization type of mentality that is being spoken
for us by somebody else in society.  And so this magazine is published
from the urban community, by people within the urban community.

<p>

The last publication that I want to mention is our newest magazine,
called <I>Reconciliation</I>.  Of course, one of our operating
assumptions -- even as we talk today about the church taking responsibility
for the problem -- is that the church itself has a major problem.
The problem is that the church has lost its central message of
the Gospel, which is the love of God <I>demonstrated</I>.  The
purpose of the Gospel is to reconcile alienated humanity to a
holy God and to each other across racial, social, and economic
barriers.

<p>

But instead we have created a church that perpetuates those barriers,
and that's the reason that all our social action has not yet prevailed
against racial division. The church is essentially operating as
a black church or a white church or a Chinese church -- which,
again, is a major heresy because the very idea of the Gospel was
to reconcile those people together in one body and the world would
know that we were Christians because of our love one for another.
If we take all the money from the federal government and somehow
shift all responsibilities to the local church, we still would
not have solved our problem.  We still would not be able to communicate
the central message of the Gospel -- that the world will know
we are Christians by our love.

<p>

<center><h3>PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION</h3></center>

<p>

So let me just share with you a little bit about the philosophy
on which our ministry is based.  Our ministry is based on the
fact that we are created in the very image of God.   This must
be the first effort of Christians -- to establish that all people
are created in the image of God, that all people therefore have
dignity, and that our dealings with each other should reflect
that sense of divinely-endowed dignity.  But how do we affirm
the dignity of individuals?  If we affirm the dignity of people,
then we can create the motivation and incentive for their own
development in society.  So how do you do that?  How do you meet
people where they live?

<p>

You must meet people at their basic need as they perceive it.
That's why uniform government programs organized in Washington
by task forces and imposed on people down at the community level
are going to further cripple people because top-down programs
do not represent their greatest aspirations.  We need to start
with the deepest felt needs of people.  Then we need to love those
people around those needs as they perceive them before we try
to change them.  Our loving them, in other words, is the change
agent.  We cannot change anyone before we choose to love him as
he is.

<p>

If you affirm dignity by meeting people at their deepest felt
needs, then we can motivate them.  That's why Jesus became bread
to people who were hungry.  That's why He became water to people
who were thirsty.  He met people at their basic need.  He loved
them around that need, and you can't do that from afar.  The felt-need
concept, then, is the basic philosophy that grounds community
development.  We are not necessarily accepting wrong behavior.
Instead, we are accepting that behavior as an expression of their
need at the time and then loving them until we can motivate them
to see that they have a deeper need that will require a change
in their lives.

<p>

How do you implement that change?  Let's look at the three basic
human needs that people have in society.

<p>

<center><h3>THREE BASIC HUMAN NEEDS</h3></center>

<p>

The most basic need that people have is the need to be loved and
nurtured.  We know that fact by observing broken families that
are lacking in love and nurture.  If you ask most people who study
urban crime, they will tell you that the vast majority of juvenile
delinquents come from a home without a father -- without that
early childhood nurture.

<p>

The second need that people have is the need to know that they
are significant.  Human beings are not &quot;niggers,&quot; 
&quot;honkies,&quot; and &quot;gooks.&quot;  Human beings were created in 
the image of God and have absolute dignity.  That dignity needs to be 
expressed in their own creativity.  Their own creativity is work.  Work
is absolutely crucial to the reflection of God's image.  God worked,
and He created us to express His dignity by our own creativity
and our own work.

<p>

The third need is the need for a reasonable amount of security.
Everybody has that basic need.  The most crucial problem in our
society is not simply the breakdown of the family, although that
in itself is a reflection of the problem.   The great problem
we have in our society is the breakdown of the community itself.
Families break down from time to time.  But when the community
breaks down, then the society falls apart.  Most social or government
action doesn't really get at the crux of the problem because it
is dealing with symptoms of the problem.  In reality, it takes
the village to raise the child and so we need to re-fix the village.
Mankind was created to live together in a neighborhood, the perfect
village.  So how do you tend to the village?  How do you develop
the community?

<p>

When I arrived in Mississippi, I realized that our education and
social welfare system did not affirm dignity.  Education merely
transported young folks out of the village, leaving the community
poorer and poorer as they went away.  The greatest problem we
have today is that people with the skills remove themselves from
the places of need -- and in their absence, we send in our welfare
system to make the needy dependent.  People need our presence
in the neighborhood with them.  They need our inspiration.

<p>

I can see that in Mendenhall.  I remember saying to my wife Vera
Mae 30 years ago, &quot;We're going to make a difference in this
little village of Mendenhall, this little poverty village.  What
we have to do is stay in this little village long enough so that
we can win some of these young people to Jesus Christ.  We have
to be able to nurture them in their faith.  We have to help them
get a love for God, a love for themselves and a love for the community.
That's a greater love than consumerism and materialism.  Then
we will help them to go off to college and to secure an education
with a purpose.  We will teach them to get the education and then
return with their new-found knowledge to help develop the resources
of the community.&quot;

<p>

I stayed in that community 12 years.  It happened.  I left there
and went to Jackson, and I stayed in that community for 10 years.
It happened there, too.   And then I went to California and stayed
in a neighborhood for 13 years.  My own children there have developed
a school in that community to carry on and to educate those children
within that neighborhood.  So, it is possible.  But our concept
of development must be &quot;indigenous.&quot;  First, we must
plant ourselves within the community.  The reason Wayne Gordon
has succeeded in Chicago is that he moved into that neighborhood
20 years ago and has lived there, inspiring people day by day.

<p>

<center><h3>THREE &quot;R'S&quot;</h3></center>

<p>

So the first &quot;R&quot; in development is <I>relocation</I>,
living in the community with the people.  The people in the community
must be able to take responsibility for their own lives.  Outside
people must come in if necessary to live among them and to inspire
individuals to take responsibility for their own lives.   Then,
those individuals in turn will have the joy of developing their
own neighborhood in their own community.  This approach to redevelopment
will take a generation to accomplish.  But you must live in the
neighborhood.  You can do some hopeful, nice things; but if you
are not living in the neighborhood, you may be convincing the
poor that they do not have worth.  You may be creating more violence
within them and giving them false hope.

<p>

The second &quot;R&quot; of development is <I>reconciliation</I>.
If the church does not believe in that, our country will be hopelessly
divided.  The new leader in the black community is a black Muslim
who does not believe that the Gospel is to reconcile people together.
The rise of Islam will aggravate racial tensions -- unless the
white congregation recalls to its senses the fact that the purpose
of the Gospel is to reconcile man to God and man to man.

<p>

The third &quot;R&quot; of development is something I call 
<I>redistribution</I>. By the word &quot;redistribution,&quot; I don't 
mean taking all the money from the rich and giving it to the poor because 
that would only mean that we have deified money.  Deifying money is
a basic problem in our society and a central problem of government.
Even a tax credit for charitable contributions runs the risk
of deifying money.  Remember that tax money didn't originally
belong to the government.  It originally belonged to the people,
and it is the responsibility of the government to manage those
resources for the greater good of society.  The first need that
people have is not money, but incentive.  They need the incentive
of community before they get money.  They need motivation.  They
need education.  They need skills, and all of these are more important
than money.

<p>

If the churches become contractors for the government, moreover,
this will be a disaster for our nation at the most fundamental
level.  I do believe that the church can inspire economic and
all other kinds of development at the grass-roots.  But if you
have churches competing for government money -- and every day
in the newspapers there is another church that, like government
poverty programs, has used the money poorly -- we will have destroyed
the last life we have within the urban community and the last
healing program we have.

<p>

Those programs that are really healing in the community are not
those that are funded by the government.  Those programs that
are really healing people are ones that have taken the initiative
and have been able to put together the private resources to do
the kind of work that the Christian Community Development Association
encompasses.

<p>

On the other hand, I would be in favor of programs like vouchers
for schools or other services.  At least the vouchers would be
based more on production and creative competition -- unlike block
grants, where the resources would be quickly wasted and swallowed.
The public schools are too big and the classrooms are too clumsy
to give nurture or cultivate Christian values at the community
level.  And in our community, we must have the motivating force
of faith.

<p>

Faith-based discussions build on the dignity and the historical
behavior of black people in our society.  The discussion of faith
must take place -- or else, we are destined still to be driven
by racism and bigotry.  And our people will still suffer.

<title>RECLAIMING THE FAMILY: WHAT PETER UHLENBERG CAN TEACH US</title>

<h2>RECLAIMING THE FAMILY:<br>
WHAT PETER UHLENBERG CAN TEACH US</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
William R. Mattox, Jr.</i></center>

<p>

<i>This speech was presented at the James Madison Institute's
&quot;Reclaiming America's Cultural and Moral Heritage&quot; conference
on April 20, 1996 in Clearwater, Fla.</i>

<p>

One of the first questions that nearly every public opinion pollster
in Washington asks survey respondents is, &quot;Do you think the
country is generally on the right track or on the wrong track?&quot;
Answers to this question typically offer a crude indication of
the public's mood at any given point in time and a useful measurement
for monitoring shifts in attitudes over time.

<p>

For many years, there was a strong correlation between people's
perceptions about the country's direction and the health of the
U.S. economy.  When the economy was up, people thought America
was on the right track.  When the economy was down, Americans
perceived that we were off course as a nation.  In fact, so closely
did these two measurements track together that if there were a
significant change-up or down-in the index of leading economic
indicators, pollsters could reliably predict that a corresponding
shift in the mood of the country would begin showing up about
six months later.  It was all very predictable.

<p>

But several years ago, something dramatic happened.  As America
began to pull out of the recession that hit in the early 1990s,
the public mood did not shift significantly.  It remained in the
doldrums.  While the country experienced improving economic conditions,
roughly two in three Americans continued to maintain that the
country was on the &quot;wrong track.&quot;  Understandably, this
caught many pollsters off guard.  They began to ask follow up
questions to see why so many Americans were pessimistic about
America's future.

<p>

What they found was quite interesting.  While some pessimists
cited downsizing or joblessness or other sorts of economic concerns,
most identified cultural concerns as the primary reason for their
pessimism.  Indeed, several recent polls have shown that as many
as four out of five Americans believe that it is significantly
tougher for a kid to grow up in America today than it was a generation
or two ago.

<p>

If we were to transport ourselves back in time, I suspect the
situation we now find ourselves in would surprise many Americans.
Imagine, for a moment, a scene from, say, 30 or 35 years ago.
A pollster knocks on the door of a young couple and says, &quot;Three
decades from now, there will be no more Soviet Union.  There will
be no more Berlin Wall.  There will be no more Cold War.  America
will be the world's only military superpower.  It will have a
Gross National Product at least three times its current size.
Given these conditions, do you believe America will be or will
not be on the right path?&quot;

<p>

I suspect many at that time would have answered affirmatively,
imagining that America had entered a glorious age.  Yet, if you
ask the American people today, they'll tell you something very
different.  They will tell you that while living standards may
be increasing in America, the quality of life is declining.  And
lest one attribute such downbeat conclusions to Americans' unrealistic
expectations, it bears mentioning that schoolchildren today do
not crawl under their desks to participate in some sort of a mock
nuclear attack drill -- in some schools, students crawl under
their desks to escape real bullets shot in one direction or another
by one of their peers.

<p>

In thinking about cultural decline and some of the problems that
have arisen in the last 35 years, I think there are at least three
lessons to be learned from the work of a sociologist at the University
of North Carolina named Peter Uhlenberg.   While I recognize that
his work may be unfamiliar to many of you, it should be noted
that long before Dan Quayle ever took on <I>Murphy Brown</I>,
or Bill Bennett ever introduced his <I>Index of Leading Cultural
Indicators</I>, or Hillary Clinton ever penned <I>It Takes a Village
to Raise a Child</I>, Peter Uhlenberg was addressing many of the
questions we are wrestling with today in the public arena.

<p>

Indeed, 10 years ago in 1986, Uhlenberg and one of his colleagues
wrote an essay that appeared in Irving Kristol's <I>Public Interest</I>
called, &quot;The Declining Well-Being of America's Youth.&quot;
The article began by arguing that the 1960s and the 1970s should
have been a golden age for young people if you look simply at
the factors social scientists say are most critical to healthy
child development.  During this time period, median family income
rose, average family size declined, and the educational background
of parents increased.  Moreover, Uhlenberg reported that the 1960s
and the 1970s were a time when there was a great deal of government
spending on programs directed toward children, most especially
public education.

<p>

Yet, at the end of this 20 year period, children's lives had not
improved dramatically.  Quite the opposite.  Citing a litany of
statistical indicators that would later make their way into Bill
Bennett's index, Uhlenberg showed that virtually every common
measurement -- teen pregnancy, juvenile crime, school test scores,
and the rest -- showed a decline in the well-being of America's
youth.

<p>

In reporting these (surprising) results, Uhlenberg challenged
social scientists -- and the public policymakers who feed off
of their work -- to consider the limits and the inevitable shortcomings
of their work.  He wrote:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Could it be that social scientists have overlooked the most crucial
determinants of children's welfare?  Could a preoccupation with
variables that are amenable to empirical measurement or to public
policy manipulation have diverted attention from variables that
are more important?</i>

</blockquote><p>

If, according to Uhlenberg, most of the scientific and policy
elite were barking up the wrong tree, what did he and his colleague
believe was responsible for the decline in children's well being
during the 1960s and 70s? Interestingly, Uhlenberg attributed
this decline to a decrease in &quot;sacrificial love.&quot;  Now,
he didn't use those words exactly.  No self-respecting social
scientist would ever use the &quot;L&quot;-word in a scholarly
journal, even one as unprententious as <I>The Public Interest</I>.
But make no mistake -- that is precisely what Uhlenberg was talking
about.  In fact, he said that while there had been a significant
increase in public investments in children, there had been a corresponding
decrease in private investments in children.  Most notably, there
had been a significant decline in the number of children that
were being raised in broken homes and a decline as well in the
amount of time two-earner families were spending with their children.

<p>

All of this gave Uhlenberg reason to believe that there were more
kids growing up without the &quot;one key ingredient&quot; that
Cornell psychologist Urie Brofenbrenner has called essential to
successful child development -- that &quot;someone has to be crazy
about the kid.&quot;

<p>

Now Uhlenberg admitted, of course, that &quot;craziness&quot;
about children is something very difficult for social scientists
to measure.  He wrote:

<p><blockquote>

<i>It is very difficult to define and even more difficult to measure
the quality of relationships.  It is even more difficult to design
policies for improving the relationships between individuals in
an intimate environment.  By contrast, measures of income, or
inequality, or family size or school expenditures are rather straightforward,
and policies designed to transfer more goods and services to children
can be conducted with relative ease.  But if the problems of American
youth stem from the state of parent-child relationships, those
who propose to improve the situation by designing policies which
bypass the family are embarking on a futile quest.  Perhaps we
are faced with a situation in which there is no change in public
policy that can have much effect or at least it seems that the
changes needed lie in an entirely different direction than those
generally advocated.</i>

</blockquote><p>

The first lesson, then, that we can derive from Peter Uhlenberg's
work is that we need to appreciate the limits of social science
and the limits of public policy.  Certainly this is a lesson for
liberals  in our day who have, over the course of the last several
decades, put a great deal of hope in government programs.  Not
only have these programs often failed to meet the high-minded,
well-intentioned goals of their sponsors, but they have in many
cases had all sorts of unintended consequences that have made
matters worse.  As Charles Murray has noted, the classic example
of the Law of Unintended Consequences is the modern welfare state,
and specifically the provision of cash entitlements to women who
bear children out of wedlock.  While such programs were intended
to help single mothers deal with a very difficult situation, they
have actually had the effect of encouraging greater illegitimacy
while discouraging the very behaviors likely to help one avoid
or overcome poverty.

<p>

Clearly, for those of us who see the folly of big government and
who want to see the well-being of children improve, there is much
work to be done in the public policy arena.  We need to be about
the business of clearing the underbrush of government programs
that are choking the health of our society and exacerbating many
of the social problems entrenched especially in the inner city.
We need to offer tax relief for families with children to make
it easier for parents to invest time in their children.  We need
to  pass divorce reform legislation that makes it considerably
more difficult (if not impossible) for individuals to walk away
from their marital commitments unilaterally.  We need to pass
school choice measures that make it easier for parents to be involved
in the most important decisions surrounding their children's education.

<p>

In addition to the conventional, pro-family policy agenda, we
need to consider other issues that affect the well-being of America's
children.  For example, I would like to see an investigation into
the role of old-age entitlements and the degree to which many
well-intentioned programs diminish bonds between generations.
I'd also like to see an exploration of zoning ordinances, and
the degree to which they contribute to the fact that many Americans
live in cookie-cutter enclaves with people whose social class,
race, age, and income are very much like their own.

<p>

Having said that, there is reason for liberals to take note of
Uhlenberg's observations about the limits of public policy (and
having argued for a conservative counter-revolution to free Americans
from the influence of big government), I think it is important
to encourage conservatives to heed Uhlenberg's cautions about
the limits of public policy as well.  Conservatives -- most especially,
religious conservatives -- should be careful not to place too
much hope in a political revolution. Yes, a conservative revolution
can bring about pro-family tax relief -- but it cannot guarantee
that parents will spend the extra discretionary time tax cuts
buy investing in their children.  Yes, conservative revolutionaries
can straighten out divorce laws -- but no law can make a man love
his wife in the way that he ought.  Yes, conservative revolutionaries
can give parents school choice -- but choice alone cannot guarantee
the kind of parental involvement that is so critical to student
achievement.

<p>

Now my point is not to suggest that public policy does not matter.
Obviously, it matters a great deal.  My point instead is simply
to suggest that a conservative revolution cannot produce the shining
city on a hill that Margaret Thatcher referred to last night.
I think we need to be reminded of this particularly since this
is an election year, when many Americans, to one degree or another,
imagine some sort of political knight in shining armor riding
in to make everything right with the world.  Surely, the outcome
of elections is critically important, but it is a mistake to put
our hope in a political savior.   As Peter Uhlenberg's work reminds
us, we must appreciate both the benefits and the limits of science
and government.  We must not look to either to save us.

<p>

The second lesson we need to learn from Dr. Uhlenberg's work may
surprise you.  In a 1986 speech he gave amplifying some of the
themes that he had originally laid out in the <I>Public Interest</I>
article, Uhlenberg said it takes a whole village to raise a child.
Now, those weren't his exact words.  And he had something very
different in mind than some who have picked up on this theme in
recent months.  But Uhlenberg makes an interesting -- and much
needed -- point.  Here's what he says:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The isolated nuclear family tends to be a fragile and vulnerable
organization.  Critics of the nuclear family are correct in asserting
that it is unreasonable to expect a husband and wife to meet all
of the social, economic, and emotional needs of each other and
of their children, especially in times of crisis.</i>

</blockquote><p>

He goes on later in his speech to say:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Families are not designed to stand in isolation but rather should
be enmeshed in strong webs of other supportive relationships.
The caring and rearing of children is certainly the responsibility
of parents, and the burdens and the joys of child rearing should
be shared with persons outside of the nuclear family.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Lest one interpret this as a call for government activism to support
families, Uhlenberg is quick to point out that he has something
very different in mind.  He said, &quot;Rather than concluding
that families should be bypassed and that government bureaucracies
relied upon to meet these needs, families could be encouraged
to join together in supportive networks.&quot;

<p>

I hadn't really given a great deal of thought to Uhlenberg's observations
about the importance of supportive networks until two years ago
when a not-so-random-act-of-kindness by a woman named Betty Rudisill
left me speechless.

<p>

Betty Rudisill is a woman who lives in the &quot;village&quot;
where I was raised.  A long-time family friend and one-time neighbor,
Mrs. Rudisill is best remembered by me as the woman who used to
save all her junk mail so that I could put it in my &quot;business
box&quot; and pretend to be a businessman.  (Some would say that
I am still pretending.)

<p>

Mrs. Rudisill is one of the first people my mother turned to when
she needed help of some kind with her kids.  Indeed, it was at
Mrs. Rudisill's house one day after school that I received a jubilant
phone call from my father at the hospital maternity ward telling
me that I had a new kid brother.

<p>

Well, I haven't seen Betty Rudisill in probably 10 years.  But
a couple of years ago, she learned that my two oldest kids were
in town visiting their grandparents.  So, she invited my mother
to bring the kids over to her house for a little tea party.  Mrs.
Rudisill then proceeded to offer these two kids she had never
even met before one of the most enchanting afternoons of their
young lives.  Mrs. Rudisill introduced my daughter to an elaborate
collection of delicate dolls with which her daughter had once
played.  And she gave my boy an opportunity to thoroughly check
out the collection of Matchbox cars that had once delighted her
son.  Needless to say, it was quite a party.  And it made quite
an impression on my children.

<p>

Now, I don't want to get carried away here.  I don't want to exaggerate
the importance of this episode.  In the end, Mrs. Rudisill's tea
party is not apt to rank as one of the most important events in
my children's lives.  Times spent with family members like Mom
and Dad and Grandmother and Papa are likely to be far more important.

<p>

But it is also true that my children's lives are richer because
of Mrs. Rudisill's kindness.  Indeed, episodes like this serve
to reinforce what my wife and I try to teach our children with
our words and actions -- that they are more of a delight than
a bother, that they are important human beings who are worth making
a fuss over.

<p>

Part of the reason why Mrs. Rudisill's tea party had such an effect
on me is that it caused me to ask:  Who will be the Betty Rudisill
in the lives of my future grandchildren when my kids send their
kids to come visit us?  And in what child's life will my wife
and I get to play the role of a Betty Rudisill?

<p>

I find myself not being able to answer those kinds of questions
as easily as I suspect my parent's generation answered them. 
And given the go-go pace of modern life, the growing transience
of our population, the weakening of community ties, and the waning
appreciation for those who quietly invest their lives in other
people, I suspect that many of my peers would struggle with these
questions as well.

<p>

In a recent article, author John Whitehead observed:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The entire concept of the neighborhood is lost to us, and our
children are growing up in a bland world.  Rarely can a child
see people working at their trades, for everyone is out of sight.
Children can no longer listen to community talk at the post office
or at the park bench and there are no abandoned houses, barns,
or attics that children can safely explore.  Forced by the many
dangers of an empty home and neighborhood to remain behind locked
doors, children wile away their hours after school by interacting
with their computers and video games.  Cyberspace has replaced
the neighborhoods familiar to their grandparents.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Now, again, don't misunderstand me.  I am not saying -- nor was
Uhlenberg saying -- that we should devote more attention to rebuilding
strong neighborhoods and communities than we do to rebuilding
strong families.  Quite the opposite.  But the health of the nuclear
family is significantly affected by the strength of the surrounding
community.  In fact, even if we were only concerned about families,
we would need to give attention to the strength and health of
the social networks in which families are enmeshed.

<p>

In this regard, I was struck several years ago by some surprising
differences in divorce rates by region.  Interestingly, divorce
rates tend to be significantly higher in the Sunbelt (and even
Bible Belt) regions of the country than in the Northeast or Midwest.
There are a number of reasons for this, but University of Texas
sociologist Norval Glenn has determined that the single greatest
predictor of divorce rates in a community is the degree to which
the people are rooted in a larger social network.  In areas of
the Midwest and the Northeast where you have more stable communities
-- where you often have strong ethnic communities -- divorce rates
tend to be lower because there is a surrounding web of individuals
who are working to try to help that couple succeed.  In more transient
areas of the country, particularly in areas where there is low
church participation, divorce rates tend to be higher because
many couples are existing very much as Uhlenberg described --
in isolation, lacking some type of supporting network to help
them and to challenge them and to hold them accountable.

<p>

I must say here that Dr. Uhlenberg not only can speak to this
question from his professional observations as a scholar.  But
he can also speak to this concern from his own personal experience.
I don't know about you, but my family has taken a great interest
in the new television show, <I>Second Noah,</I> that depicts the
life of a couple that is based here in Tampa.  The couple has
a rather unique story.  Over the course of time, they have adopted
eight or 10 different kids of varying races and backgrounds to
raise as their own.

<p>

In many ways, that television show closely resembles the life
of Peter Uhlenberg and his wife Pam.  Over the last two decades,
they have adopted a dozen or so children.  Some of these children
have physical handicaps; some come from mixed racial backgrounds;
some have learning disabilities; some have no special needs --
except the need for a devoted Mom and Dad. If you wish to pay
tribute to the kinds of sacrifices that Peter Uhlenberg and his
wife are making in their lives with those kids, they will be quick
to tell you that it would not be possible for them to be involved
in the work that they are doing in their home were it not for
the surrounding network of support that they get from the local
church congregation in which they play a part.  Indeed, there
are members of that congregation that have established big brother
or big sister relationships with different members of the Uhlenberg
family.  I'm sure that they are right-that if it were not for
that supportive network, the really heroic work that Peter Uhlenberg
and his wife are doing would  be very difficult, if not impossible.

<p>

The third lesson, then, that I think we can learn from Peter and
his wife (and his entire congregation, for that matter) is this
-- if we hope to turn things around in this country, if we hope
to see America become the shining city on a hill, it's going to
cost us something.  It's going to cost us personally. It's going
to require sacrificial love on our part, if I can use the &quot;L&quot;-word.
I'm not speaking of the hollow, feel-good love that was celebrated
by the '60s counterculture when Peter Uhlenberg was a student
at the University of California at Berkeley.  I'm speaking about
the gritty, unconditional, sacrificial love that he and his wife
have found and are now sharing with their kids.  That is a love
that is costly, to be sure, but it is a love that offers great
rewards.

<p>

I don't know about you, but I am very much looking forward to
the Olympics that will take place later this year.  I always set
aside time to view them because I'm interested in seeing who will
show themselves to be the fastest sprinter or the highest jumper
or the longest javelin thrower.  But the greatest honor that is
reserved at the Olympics goes not to one of these individuals
who has managed to develop a specialized skill to a greater extent
than anyone else.  The greatest honor goes to two athletes; one
in the men's division called a decathlete who participates in
10 different events, and the other to a female heptathlete who
participates in seven different athletic events.  Now these athletes
cannot outperform everyone on the planet in every single one of
these categories.  Instead, they are the athletes best able to
outperform others in a combination of them all.  They are, in
a sense, the best all-around or most well-rounded athletes.

<p>

We live in a day when 15 minutes or more of fame is quite often
available to anyone who can excel in a single area of life --
even if that success comes at the expense of meeting more important
responsibilities in other areas of life. In many ways, then,
the challenge for each of us personally is not just to seek to
make an important contribution in our work, or in our neighborhood,
or in our churches or synagogues, or in our homes.  It is instead
to seek to make an important contribution in all of these areas
simultaneously.  The challenge for us is to strive to be as well
rounded as the decathlete or the heptathlete, never allowing our
pursuit of excellence in one area to come at the expense of the
others.

<p>

Peter Uhlenberg, in my mind, is meeting that challenge.  He is
a whole man.  If the serious social problems Uhlenberg tracks
in his work are to be reversed, we will need to become more like
him -- people who not only wring our hands about various social
problems, but people who take personal action in our own homes
and neighborhoods to address these serious problems.

<p>

Thank you very much.

<title>KIDS HOPE USA: A VISION FOR CHURCHES AND CHILDREN</title>

<h2>KIDS HOPE USA:<br>
A VISION FOR<br>
CHURCHES AND CHILDREN</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Dr. Virgil Gulker</i></center>

<p>

<i>The following speech was presented at the Family Research Council's
&quot;World Without Welfare&quot; symposium, held at the Willard
Hotel in Washington, D.C. on Dec. 13, 1995.</i>

<p>

My wife overheard someone recently call me an expert on the care
and nurture of children.  She was quite amused by that comment.
She simply smiled and walked away, and we haven't talked about
it since.

<p>

If your wife is like my wife, she remembers those times when we
have done anything but illustrate expertise in parenting.  I recall
the time, for example, when I disciplined my 4-year-old, and,
following the discipline, realized that I had made a mistake.
I had disciplined her for something that I had misinterpreted.
So I got down on my knees and put my hands on her little shoulders
and said, &quot;Emily, Daddy was wrong.  Will you forgive Daddy?&quot;
And Emily looked me in the eye and said, &quot;Sure, Daddy. I
forgive you lots.&quot;  I think all of you can relate to that
at some level.

<p>

I have two passions.  One is children and the other is the church,
the body of Christ.  I've listened today.  I've heard about so
many church-based organizations, but I haven't heard much about
the church itself.  My passion is the church.  I look at the 350,000
religious congregations in this country -- with an average membership
of roughly 100 people per congregation -- and I think of what
those 35 million Christians could accomplish.  The potential is
awesome.  We have five times more churches than post offices and
35 times more churches than McDonald's restaurants.

<p>

The church is clearly the most sustainable local organization,
yet I hear so little about the role the church and its members
can play in this process of reaching, reconciling and healing
lives.  The experience of an organization I founded called Love,
Inc. says very clearly that there are Christians in every community
who are prepared to help, to give hope, to share love if 
they are approached -- if they have the appropriate training --
and if they are affirmed for that relationship.  What I learned
with Love, Inc., through the 300,000 volunteers, was that we don't
need heroes.  We need very simple, very basic people.  People
like me and like many of you who are prepared to come alongside
someone who needs principally love, nurture, and affirmation.

<p>

I was challenged two years ago by an organization called International
Aid to put my passions to work.  They said, &quot;Virg, can you
create a model that will somehow engage church members themselves
in the lives of the most at-risk children and families?&quot;
I spent a year researching that.  Instead of promoting answers,
I asked questions.  I went to people who were involved with health
services and human services, education, religion, government services,
and professional volunteer services.  I asked them three questions,
and the answers to those questions forever transformed my approach
to ministry.

<p>

<center><h3>THREE QUESTIONS TO THE HELPING COMMUNITY:</h3></center>

<p>

The first question was: <i>&quot;What are the needs faced by
our children and families?&quot;</i>

<p>

We all read these things in the newspaper, but I wanted to know
how the experts would define the need.  What I heard absolutely
broke my heart.  If you can look into some of the faces of these
children experiencing the pain and despair that is a part of their
lives and <I>not</I> cry, you have a problem.  I came to the conclusion
that America either does not care for its children or does not
know how to care.  How else can you explain the fact that more
children in this country will be pregnant, murdered, drug-dependent,
incarcerated, or poor than the children of any other industrialized
country?  How else can you explain the fact that 0-3-year-old
children are now some of the most neglected children in the entire
world?  One out of every four of our children lives in poverty.
Thirty-one percent live in fatherless homes.  The litany of woe
goes on and on.

<p>

Then I wanted to find out, <i>&quot;Why so much need?&quot;</i>

<p>

I went into my own community and discovered to my dismay that
in Holland, Michigan, an idyllic place along the Lake Michigan
shoreline, with literally a church on every corner and an unemployment
rate of  3 percent, we have had a youth violence increase of 400
percent over the last five years.  Four hundred percent!  That
exceeds the national average by 300 percent.  &quot;Why?&quot;
I asked.  &quot;Why are so many of these young people engaging
in personally and socially destructive behaviors?&quot;  Every
expert said to me, &quot;It's because these young people and children
are desperate for affirmation and for value. Someone needs to
say to them, 'You have value.  You have purpose.  You have meaning
in this community.  Your life has meaning.'&quot;

<p>

Children are looking in all the wrong places for affirmation.
Affirmation is the key need for all of us, and we will find it
-- if not in appropriate ways, then we will find it in <I>in</I>appropriate
ways.  More and more young people are turning toward gangs, for
example.  Michigan has 83 counties, and we have organized gang
activity now in 44 of the 83 counties.

<p>

A 15-year-old boy in my community joined one of four major gangs,
two of which came out of Los Angeles.  The ceremony was as brief
as it was brutal.  They said to him, &quot;Armando, all you have
to do is stand here and take our beating for two minutes without
resisting.&quot;  All the men wore steel-toed boots.  For two
minutes they brutalized this kid.  Absolutely brutalized him.
At the end of two minutes, he was required to stand up, embrace
each man, and call him brother.  Then he was allowed as a reward
to participate in front of all the men in sex with a girl who
had also become part of the gang.  The initiation ceremony for
girls, as some of you know, is much, much worse.

<p>

The next day someone went to him and said, &quot;Armando, why?
Why would you allow yourself to go through that?&quot;  His answer
was immediate.  He said, &quot;I knew this was going to hurt really
bad, but I felt that if I could take it for just a couple of minutes,
I'd be surrounded by people who loved me.&quot;  That's the name
of the game, friends.

<p>

My second-grade daughter (two years ago) was asked to join a gang
by a little girl whose principal characteristic was her body odor.
She would crawl under the teacher's desk periodically and moan,
&quot;No one loves me.  No one loves me.  No one loves me.&quot;
Children would not stand in line with her.  They would point
at her and laugh.  Finally, she also began to move toward gang
activity.  Second grade!  She wanted my daughter to go along with
her.  But my daughter did a revolutionary thing.  Instead of reporting
her to the teacher, she began to pray for her and said to me,
&quot;Daddy, I'm going to be her friend.&quot;  My daughter became
her friend.

<p>

Other teenagers, young people, are turning to pregnancy.  Talk
to anyone working with pregnant girls.  Ask them why these girls
are pregnant.  Sex has nothing to do with it.  These girls in
most cases are so desperate for someone to love and value them,
for someone to hold them, for someone to be intimate for 20 minutes,
that they will endure anything, including pregnancy.  It's a desperate
situation out there.

<p>

Others who do not find affirmation turn to suicide.  Our suicide
rate for young people is up three times -- a three-time increase
in 10 years.  One of the second-graders we had hoped to place
in a loving relationship through Kids Hope is no longer eligible
for our program.  He tried to kill himself and was institutionalized.
I was horrified.  I went to the school and I said, &quot;You're
going to have to help me understand this.  I have a second-grade
daughter.  How does a second-grader arrive at trying to kill himself?&quot;
The teacher said, very simply, &quot;These children, whose lives
are so desperate and without hope, conclude that death is safer
than life.  So they choose death.&quot;  It's happening more and
more.

<p>

Experts told me that we can expect to lose a generation of children.
This will be the first time we have lost a generation in this
country without a war.

<p>

My next question for them was: <i>&quot;What should the church
do?  Do you see a role for the church?&quot;</i>

<p>

Almost to a person they gave me the same answer.  &quot;Virg,&quot;
they said, &quot;it's really not very complex.  Tell the church
to mobilize its members to form one-to-one relationships with
the youngest children.  Tell them to go in to the elementary schools
and work with children who are at that critical age when values
are formed, self-esteem is developed, and critical academic and
problem-solving skills must be acquired.  Virg, tell them to do
that.&quot;

<p>

The mayor of my city when asked what we should do about the violence
in our city said, &quot;We don't need any more programs.&quot;
Michigan, as you may know, has 40,000 non-profit organizations,
not counting churches.  We don't need any more programs.  We need
more caring adults to put an arm around a troubled child and say,
&quot;I love you.  I love you, Judy, Tom, Mary, Sammy, Armando.
I love you.&quot;

<p>

Ron Vogel, former national director of the WIC program, met with
me once to talk about church involvement.  I said, &quot;What
do you think, Ron?  Can a church play a role in meeting the needs
of the WIC mothers and their children?&quot;  He said, &quot;Tell
you what.  I can give the churches a strategy that they can use
to single-handedly reduce the incidence of infant mortality, low
birth weight and long-term dependence on the public health system.&quot;
I said, &quot;Ron, let's do it.  How much will it cost?&quot;
And he said, &quot;Nothing.  All I want the church to do is to
mobilize its mothers and its grandmothers to form one-to-one relationships
with pregnant young women.  Talk to the young women about breast-feeding
and get them to the clinic on time.  If they do only that, they
will transform a generation of young, black women.&quot;

<p>

Anacostia, in southeast Washington, at that point had the highest
infant mortality rate in the country.  At precisely the same time
I heard that statistic, an African-American young woman who worked
in a local ministry came to me and said, &quot;We don't know what
to do.  We have African-American grandmothers who are complaining
to their pastors and others that they no longer have any value
in their church or their community.&quot;  This is all about people.
We have to reestablish the people issue.  It's not about welfare
reform.  That can be a very nice intellectual dodge, but the reality
is that we're talking about people with resources and people in
pain.

<p>

Sometimes people who are very cynical say to me, &quot;Virg, do
you really think that God is in our world?&quot;  I say, &quot;Absolutely.
I can take you right to where He is.&quot;  They say, &quot;Well,
where would I go?&quot;  And I say, &quot;At the intersection
of a caring Christian and a child or any other person in need.
That's where my God lives.&quot;  He's out there right now. 
People in urban ministry encounter God countless times every day
and every month and every year.  That's the potential.

<p>

I recently asked someone who works with troubled children in my
area what kind of children he wants Kids Hope to love.  I expected
a wonderfully learned and long-winded answer.  He surprised me.
He said, &quot;Virg, focus on the children who need hugs.&quot;
I've been thinking about that now for about six months.  I like
what that says about the potential of the body of Christ.  What
if the local body of Christ were known as that distinctive organization
within the community that formed relationships with kids and families
and hugged them?

<p>

<center><h3>FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS TO THE CHURCH:</h3></center>

<p>

I asked the experts one last question: <i>&quot;Will the church
do that?&quot;</i>

<p>

Without any hesitation, almost everyone said the same thing: 
&quot;No way.  We know we can count on the church for commodities,
for holiday food baskets, for food pantries, for clothing closets,
for a ride to the doctor, for Vacation Bible School, and for all
that is wonderful and necessary in many cases.  We have found
to our dismay, however, that we cannot rely upon the church for
relationships.  We've had to turn elsewhere for relationships.&quot;

<p>

I didn't want to believe that because I have worked with church
volunteer programs for 20 years.  I went out and began to survey
pastors -- determined to prove these people wrong because I believe
that relationships are at the heart of our Gospel.  Without relationships,
there is no reconciliation.  I'm not sure there is redemption.
So I surveyed pastors from churches ranging in size from 50 members
to 6,000 members.

<p>

I asked one question:  <I>&quot;How many of your members are engaged
in one-to-one relationships with at-risk elementary school children
in the neighborhood of your church?&quot;</I>  Out of a combined
membership of 30,000, I found fewer than 20.

<p>

My follow-up question was: <i>&quot;How many of your families
are in relationships with some of the families of the children?&quot;</i>
The answer was fewer than 10.

<p>

That doesn't make sense to me.  Seventy-nine percent of all church
growth is attributed to a person, a friend or a relative, telling
someone about Jesus Christ.  We're investing all kinds of money
in programs and agencies.  Only 10 percent of Americans now have
any sort of significant relationship with a non-believer.  Eighty
percent of all people who accept Jesus Christ do so by age 18,
yet every church I visited was dedicating the vast majority of
its outreach and evangelism money to programs touching people
20 years old and older.  It's a wonderful strategy to fail, and
sadly, it's not reaching these hurting children and their families.

<p>

Do Christians care?  Absolutely.  I get letters and phone calls
virtually every day and have for 20 years.  When we were establishing
Love, Inc., I had calls from every state.  Then we began to get
calls and letters from other countries.  Every request sounded
the same.  People said,  &quot;We want to share the love of Christ
with the poor and we don't know how to do it and our church doesn't
know how to help us.  Can you get something started here?&quot;
There are so many people who care.

<p>

Recently, I went into a large church and I said to them, &quot;Your
church is going into the neighborhood school in eight months to
work with at-risk elementary school children.  Next Sunday, I'm
going to walk from this church to that school.  I invite you to
go with me one mile.&quot;  I had a feeling that my wife, my two
daughters and I would have a very leisurely stroll.  God surprised
me.  I showed up at the church the next Sunday, and 250 men, women
and children were standing there.

<p>

We walked a mile to the school, and then we held hands as we circled
the school.  Forget church-state.  We simply held hands.  We prayed
for those children.  We prayed asking God to bless our commitment
to transform and love those children.

<p>

I still have people coming up to me saying, &quot;Virg, what we
needed was a symbol.&quot;  Bob Woodson has said very appropriately
that conservatives, Christians and Republicans -- not necessarily
in that order -- are much less adept than liberals and Democrats
at using symbols.  I'm finding that so many people want to rally
around this vision of helping and loving a child -- especially
when given a symbol.

<p>

The key problem I found in churches is not a lack of compassion.
As I inquired into the organizational structure, every church
I worked with had the same problem.  They lacked any sort of system
or infrastructure for the recruitment, training, supervision and
affirmation of volunteers. It's like a small business trying to
operate without a personnel department.  Most of these churches
could characterize their ministry by saying, &quot;We pay, we
pray, and we give stuff away.  We do wonderful, wonderful things,
but we never change any lives or any situations.&quot;

<p>

Our call at Kids Hope is to go into one church at a time and to
create that infrastructure within each individual church so that
they can engage their members in the lives of other children.
My past work has all been devoted to community agencies.  I would
go into communities and set up agencies to draw together the resources
of hundreds of churches.  I've changed.  I found that, when many
churches are involved in a project, every church owns it and no
church owns it.  The director of the church-based organization
will spend 70 percent of his or her time raising money, 10 percent
managing public relations, and the rest just feeling generally
frustrated.

<p>

The church is the one most sustainable local organization.  If
we can give them an infrastructure, a personnel department designed
to link their members with children and families in the neighborhood,
we can change the lives of the church members and the lives of
those people needing help.  The church simply giving out food,
money or clothing is not going to make it.  That's the same kind
of commodity distribution that the welfare system has tried for
so long, and it has not worked.

<p>

We are the body of Christ.  We have the most awesome potential,
not just to share Christ but to share that transforming, reconciling
message that can change and empower lives.  That's what we can
do.  If we have 35 million Christians in this country, I contend
that we need to apply the Gideon principle to them.  Remember
when Gideon fought the Midianites?  He started with a ridiculously
small army of 32,000.  God stripped His army until He was left
with less than 1 percent.

<p>

If we look at 1 percent of the existing church membership, we're
looking at 350,000 people.  If each of those people gives a dollar
a week for a year, that will amount to $18,200,000.  If each volunteers
an hour a week, valued at $10 per hour, that labor will be worth
$182,000,000.  That remnant alone can contribute $200,200,000
to transforming outreach.  We must not demean the potential of
the body of Christ -- the very means, the arms and the legs that
He has given us to reach out.

<p>

Let me conclude by sharing the metaphor that has really guided
my ministry.  Because I'm about children and the church, this
really struck me.  A number of years ago, during the Vietnam conflict,
a number of Vietnam veterans were shipped to a hospital in San
Diego.  What they shared in common was that they had lost all
of their arms and legs.  They were lying with simply their heads
and torsos on beds.  They had fallen into such a profound depression
that they simply could not speak.  They were hiding within themselves.
The registered nurse on the floor tried everything to get them
out of their depression, but she failed.

<p>

Finally, in creative frustration, she called the other nurses
together and said, &quot;Gather up all of the terminally-ill babies
in the hospital and strap them face down to the torsos of these
veterans.&quot;  As she left the room, she said to the veterans,
&quot;Gentlemen, these babies are dying.  Most have no visits.
No one to love them.  There is no one to bond with them, and
you have nothing to do.  Your job is to love these babies.&quot;

<p>

The nurses left the room.  They did this day after day.  And in
less than one week, all of the Vietnam veterans had escaped their
depression and were orchestrating the care of the babies.  Each
man fought it, but every time he opened his eyes the eyes of a
little baby were penetrating his soul, looking for that heart
of compassion that had to be in there.

<p>

Those terminally-ill babies, I think, are the children and the
families in our society.  We're losing them.  We are losing a
generation of children.  The veterans, I believe, are the body
of Christ, if it refuses to minister in the name of Christ.  If
it refuses to be the arms and legs of the church, the church and
Christ Himself will be powerless.

<p>

But the church could also be the nurses.  God calls us to be that
creative force, calling the culture -- not just to an awareness
of the need -- but to a realization of what the Christian community
can do in responding to that need.  Our task is, not simply to
hold that baby up in the maternity ward to show people how cute
it is, but rather to hold the baby up and to suggest specific
strategies that the church, the body of Christ, can use in reaching
out to children.  We must love them, touch them, put an arm around
those babies as they grow older and say, &quot;I love you.  Jesus
Christ loves you, and that will make all the difference in your
world and mine.&quot;

<p>

One of our dear volunteers has shown the humor of God.  This woman
is one of the wealthiest women I have ever met.  She works with
Kids Hope through her church.  She has been assigned to a child
from one of the poorest families in her county.  She noticed that
Billy needed shoes, badly.  The teacher said, &quot;Don't buy
them.  It will cause a major disruption in the family.&quot;

<p>

The volunteer came to me and said, &quot;Virg, it's killing me.
I need to buy Billy a pair of shoes, but they won't let me.&quot;
This woman could buy Billy a shoe store if she wanted to.

<p>

I said to her, &quot;What did the teacher ask you to do?  Did
she ask you to buy shoes?&quot;  She answered, &quot;No.  She
said, 'Minnie, could you love this boy?  Could you help this boy
understand how important he is?'  So that's what I've been doing.&quot;

<p>

I talked to Minnie the next week and I said, &quot;How's that
coming, that love business?&quot;  She said, &quot;It's incredible.
I came into school last week and Billy was on the other side
of the school, at the other end of the hallway, and he saw me.
He opened his arms and he began to run down the hallway shouting
at the top of his lungs, 'Mrs. Matthews!  Mrs. Matthews!  Mrs.
Matthews!'  Then he came next to me and scooped me up in a hug.&quot;

<p>

This is a first-grade boy.  He didn't need shoes nearly as badly
as he needed love.  The church has always been there to give Billy
shoes.  The Billy's in our world now need above all else to be
loved and valued.

<p>

No agency -- public, private or para-church -- can do that because
their role is to respond to need.  The role of the church is to
respond to people.  We can do it.  We have the answer to this
problem.  We can create an army to attack these child and family
problems, but we need the people and they need the vision of a
healing and loving God.  Thank you.

<title>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES HAVE WORSENED</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES HAVE<br>
WORSENED SINCE CHINA<br>
RECEIVED MFN STATUS</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Testimony of Gracie S. Hsu, Policy Analyst<br>
Family Research Council<br>
Submitted to the House Committee on International Relations<br>
Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights<br>
June 18, 1996</h4></center>

<p>

Mr. Chairman, the Family Research Council is pleased that the
Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights has
chosen to address the human rights consequences of extending &quot;most
favored nation&quot; (MFN) trade privileges to China.  This hearing
is especially timely considering the fact that the House of Representatives
is scheduled to vote on legislation regarding China's MFN status
in the coming week.

<p>

Mr. Chairman, for 15 years, the United States has extended &quot;most
favored nation&quot; trade status to China.  Originally, it had
been argued that an economic &quot;open door&quot; might encourage
the Chinese government to shape up their human rights policies,
but in these past 15 years, we have only seen the barbarity and
cruelty of this communist regime increase.

<p>

Thus, the Family Research Council strongly urges Congress to pass
legislation revoking China's &quot;most favored nation&quot; trade
status because of China's continuing human rights abuses.

<p>

It was seven years ago when 700 Chinese democracy-seekers were
ruthlessly gunned down at Tiananmen Square.  It was only last
year when Hong Kong newspapers reported that aborted human fetuses
were being cannibalized in China, sold as health food.  Last September,
directly before the United Nations Fourth World Conference on
Women in Beijing, the Chinese government executed nine prisoners
to &quot;send a message&quot; to their own people that they should
not attempt to demonstrate against the Chinese government.

<p>

In addition to these &quot;newer&quot; human rights violations,
other abuses which existed in China prior to their receiving MFN
status continue to go unabated.  For example, the Chinese government
continues to exploit prisoners for slave labor in their gulag
system known as &quot;laogai,&quot; as Harry Wu has demonstrated.
Mr. Chairman, it is these same slaves which make many of the
products which China exports for profit.

<p>

Furthermore, Chinese women continue to be forcibly aborted and/or
involuntarily sterilized.  It is well documented that women, even
in their eighth and ninth months of pregnancy, have been literally
dragged from their homes by &quot;family planning&quot; officials,
tied down with their feet in stirrups, and forcibly aborted.

<p>

China's one-child-per-couple mandate has also led to widespread
sex selection abortion, and unborn baby girls are most often the
innocent victims of this crime against humanity.  But even for
those little girls who are born alive, many are immediately abandoned
by their parents.  China has chosen to deal with this &quot;problem&quot;
of abandoned children by starving the little girls to death in
state-run orphanages.

<p>

Religious persecution also continues to abound in China.  As Family
Research Council President Gary Bauer testified before this Subcommittee
in February, Christians are systematically intimidated, tortured
and imprisoned in China.  Indeed, Amnesty International reports
cases of Christian women hung by their thumbs from wires and beaten
with heavy rods, denied food and water, and shocked with electric
probes.

<p>

These, Mr. Chairman, are crimes against humanity.  These are the
brutal and unjust actions of a communist regime to which our nation
has extended &quot;most favored nation&quot; trade privileges
for 15 years.

<p>

The failure of the United States to hold China accountable for
its heinous behavior has only encouraged the communist regime
to become more oppressive because it no longer fears that any
sanctions will be taken against it.  Year after year, the United
States has issued only empty threats against the Chinese government,
and in doing so, we have strained our credibility and undercut
our own stature as a moral leader in the world.  Indeed, the U.S.
has sent the shameful message that, as a country, we care more
about succeeding economically than about championing universal
human rights.

<p>

It is time for the United States to put teeth to our convictions
and revoke China's &quot;most favored nation&quot; trade privileges.

<title>TESTIMONY ON THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>TESTIMONY ON THE<br>
DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Testimony of<br>
Gary L. Bauer<br>
President, Family Research Council<br>
on the Defense of Marriage Act (S. 1740)<br>
July 11, 1996<br>
United States Senate Judiciary Committee</h4></center>

<p>

Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for inviting me to testify.

<p>

As the head of an organization supported by 300,000 families,
I am often asked to provide information on various issues that
are important to family life, from tax credits to welfare reform.
But in all my years of pro-family work, I cannot recall an issue
that was so central to the very idea of family.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act would have seemed unnecessary and
even unthinkable just a few years ago, even though marriage has
been under siege for some time.  No-fault divorce, a sex-saturated
culture, and growing fiscal and social pressures have sundered
many a marriage or, in some cases, discouraged them from happening,
even with children in the picture.  Many Americans are wrestling
with the pain of broken families and are trying to rebuild their
lives.

<p>

The decline of marriage has spawned America's most destructive
social problems, as fatherless households have multiplied.  You
probably have heard the litany by now, but let me take a moment
to mention some of the devastation caused by a lack of support
for marriage: out-of-wedlock pregnancies, sexually-transmitted diseases, 
alcohol and drug abuse, educational failure, community decline, and 
last but not least, a frightening epidemic of crime that has changed 
the way we live.

<p>

A visitor from another land might well observe that we seem caught
in a quickening downward spiral.  As marriages fail, the pain
spreads out through the next generation to the ones that follow.

<p>

The solution seems self-evident:  If the collapse of marriage
is the problem, why don't we move to strengthen this irreplaceable
institution?  Well, we could and should.  Yet we are being asked
by some groups with a radical agenda to do precisely the opposite.

<p>

We are being asked not only to ignore the mounting evidence that
the mother-and-father family is the foundation of civilization,
but to weaken marriage further by redefining it.  We are being
asked to pretend that marriage is no longer about bringing the
two sexes together in a biological, social, economic, legal and
spiritual union.  We are being asked to restructure our entire
sexual morality and social system to embrace a concept that has
never been accepted anywhere in the world by any major culture.
We are being asked to pretend that somehow two men could replace
a mother in a child's life or that two women could take the place
of a father and that it won't make any difference to children.

<p>

Often I am asked, what does it matter if two men or two women
down the street want to call what they have &quot;marriage?&quot;
Why does that hurt you or your marriage?  Well it doesn't --
unless they bring the law into it.  Then the fiction is imposed
on everyone and the counterfeit will do great harm to the special
status that the genuine institution has earned.  There are many
relationships in which love is involved.  But marriage is a unique
bonding of the two sexes, with the probable expectation of procreation
of children.  It is the core of civilization and is universally
honored.

<p>

Marriage is more than a union of two people who have strong feelings
for one another.  Marriage establishes bloodlines, kinship, the
passage of family traditions and values through the generations,
the passing on of family names and property and it is the most
important source of social stability.  If we all existed for only
one generation, we would not have as strong a case for creating
legal and cultural safeguards for marriage.  But the protection
of marriage is not only about social harmony.  It is about creating
a future for our children.

<p>

Nobody is denied the &quot;right&quot; to marry.  They just have
to meet the requirements.  The two sexes must be present for it
to be marriage.  If that definition is radically altered based
on the &quot;feelings&quot; of those in other relationships, then
there is no logical reason for not letting several people marry,
or for gutting other marital requirements, such as minimum age,
blood relative status or even the limitation of the relationship
to human beings.

<p>

Marriage is blessed by all major religions as the union of a man
and a woman, so creating a counterfeit would be a slap in the
face to millions of Americans.  As George Washington observed,
government is not eloquence or suggestion; government is force.
If the government imposes a definition of marriage on all citizens
that runs directly counter to the teachings of the great religions,
it forces millions outside the civil law.

<p>

The state would be telling many, many people that their beliefs
are no longer valid, and would turn the civil rights laws into
a battering ram against them:

<p><ul>

<li>Businessmen and women would be prosecuted if they failed to
offer spousal health benefits to homosexual &quot;spouses&quot;.

<p>

<li>Children would necessarily be taught in schools that homosexual
relations represent the moral equivalent of marital love.

<p>

<li>Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; would give a mighty tool to
those pushing for adoption of children in homosexual households.

<p>

<li>Private organizations like the Boy Scouts of America would
come under increased pressure to abandon their moral standards.

</ul><p>

We are here today because a few judges in Hawaii, against the
expressed wishes of the Hawaiian people, are poised to strike
down Hawaii's marriage law and legalize homosexual &quot;marriages.&quot;
Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution,
it is likely that homosexuals from other states would fly to Hawaii,
get a marriage license and then come home, demanding the exact
same status as married couples in other states.  This would create
legal havoc and opportunities for further judicial mischief.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act merely puts the federal government
on record as defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman
as husband and wife, and it asserts Congress' constitutional prerogative
of interpreting the Full Faith and Credit Clause so that the other
49 states will not be forced to submit to a handful of judges
in Hawaii.

<p>

On May 20, in <I>Romer v. Evans</I>, the U.S. Supreme Court showed
how little regard some powerful jurists have for the right of
people to govern themselves in a democratic republic.  Congress
needs to act now to reassert the legislative branch's constitutional
role as the voice of the people and the maker of the laws.  It
needs to send a message to the Supreme Court and other courts
that they cannot be permitted to exchange morality for immorality
in the nation's laws.

<p>

In his powerful and eloquent dissent, Justice Scalia warned that
we are at a crossroads in which the very idea of a self-governing
federal system is hanging in the balance.  We cannot afford to
let judges usurp any more power and tyrannize an already besieged
moral code. The Defense of Marriage Act is a powerful antidote
to the destructive trend that has gripped this country at the
hands of some injudicious judges.

<p>

Finally, I would like to add that ordinary people did not pick
this fight.  They are not the aggressors.  They are merely defending
the basic morality that has sustained the culture for everyone.
Yet good men and women of varying beliefs have been subjected
to a barrage of name-calling and abuse simply for saying that
marriage ought to be the union of a man and a woman and that the
law should protect this vital social norm.  It is not hatred to
prefer normalcy.  It is not bigotry to resist radical redefinition
of marriage. It is not intolerance to believe in traditional
morality.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act is a matter of common sense.  It is
sorely needed.  I doubt that in all you do here, you will do anything 
more important. I urge you to give it swift approval so that the 
Congress can move to protect our society's irreplaceable institution.

<p>

Thank you very much.

<title>WHY WE NEED THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</title>

<h2>WHY WE NEED THE<br>
DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Robert H. Knight</i></center>

<p>

<i>This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  The briefing was
sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

The thing I hear most often in debates about the Defense of Marriage
Act is, &quot;Who will it hurt if two gays or two lesbians down
the street want to share their love?&quot;

<p>

Well, if you put it that way, the answer is almost nobody, if
they keep it entirely to themselves and their behavior does not
involve the transmission of AIDS and other diseases that are epidemic
among homosexuals. That is probably unrealistic.  And they hurt
themselves in living a less fulfilling life.

<p>

Most Americans believe in the philosophy of  &quot;live and let
live.&quot; They don't want to make the plight of homosexuals
any more difficult than it already is.  But tolerance is not what
homosexual activists are seeking.  They are demanding that society
elevate homosexuality to the moral level of marriage.   When they
bring the law into it, they are no longer just minding their own
business but imposing it on every single citizen.

<p>

If you are a devout Christian, Jew or Muslim, or merely someone
who believes homosexuality is immoral and harmful, and the law
declares homosexuality a protected status, then your personal
beliefs are now outside civil law.  This has very serious implications,
for if the law declares opposition to homosexuality as bigotry,
then the entire power of the civil rights apparatus can be brought
against you.

<p>

Businessmen will have to subsidize homosexuality or face legal
sanctions.  Schoolchildren will have to be taught that homosexuality
is the equivalent of marital love.  Religious people will be told
their beliefs are no longer valid, and their independence will
be challenged.

<p>

While homosexuals say they want only tolerance, they are being
dishonest.  They already have tolerance, but are aiming for government-
and corporate-mandated acceptance.  Where gay rights have become
law, people of conscience are already being targeted for punishment
in the name of &quot;diversity&quot; training.

<p>

The Boy Scouts of America are under legal attack in the states
which have special rights for &quot;sexual orientation.&quot;
The Scouts, a private group, are being told to abandon their
moral code of more than 80 years and to place young boys under
homosexual men on camping trips -- or face financial ruin.  The
attack against the Scouts is really an attack on parents, because
parents have the right, in a free nation, to entrust their children
to organizations that reflect the parents' most deeply held beliefs.
If they cannot do this, then we are living in tyranny.  That
is the real, ugly side of gay rights that the media will not show
-- the tyrannical reality.

<p>

Here's an example of where we are headed.  In Hamilton, Ontario,
the mayor was asked by homosexual activists to declare a &quot;gay
pride week.&quot;  Hamilton being a blue-collar, largely Catholic
town, the mayor declined.  He was hauled before a human rights
commission, personally fined $5,000, and told that he had committed
the crimes of &quot;gay bashing&quot; and hatemongering.

<p>

If homosexuals achieve the power to force others to pretend that
their unions are &quot;marriages,&quot; then people of conscience
will be told to ignore their God-given beliefs and to support
what they regard as immoral and destructive.

<p>

Homosexuality has been discouraged in all cultures because it
is inherently wrong and harmful to individuals, families and societies.
The only reason it has been able to gain such prominence in America
today is the near blackout on information about homosexual behavior
itself.  We are being treated to a steady drumbeat of propaganda
echoing the stolen rhetoric of the black civil rights movement
and misrepresenting science.

<p>

Here are some of the myths:

<p>

<b>The 10 percent estimate of homosexuality in the population.</b>
Based entirely on the discredited Kinsey studies, the figure
is a fiction.  The reality is nearer to 1 percent or, at most,
2 percent.

<p>

<b>Genetic studies.</b> Activists say homosexuality is just
like skin color.  But there are thousands of former homosexuals,
but no former blacks or Hispanics.  Virtually all gay genetic
studies have been done by homosexual activists.  All have huge
methodological flaws, and many point to the opposite conclusion
-- that homosexuality is a learned behavior rather than in-born.

<p>

<b>Gay teen suicide.</b> We are told that one in three teen suicides
are gay teens, but this comes from a single report that was repudiated
by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan.  Other
studies repudiate the figure as well.

<p>

<b>Psychological studies.</b> In the 1950s, UCLA psychologist
Evelyn Hooker conducted three tests comparing groups of 30 hand-picked
homosexual men with 30 randomly-selected heterosexual men.  In
two of the three tests, the gays were easily picked out because
they sexualized their drawings.  Yet this study was cited in 1973
as the centerpiece of research leading the American Psychiatric
Association and the American Psychological Association to remove
homosexuality from their lists of emotional disorders.

<p>

<b>Hospital visitation.</b> Homosexuals claim that they have
difficulty visiting loved ones in hospitals because families have
primary visitation rights.  Yet an informal survey of hospitals
in the Washington, D.C. area and other metro areas reveals that
no homosexuals are being denied any visitation rights.  A Nexis
search of July 2, 1996 also shows no news stories about homosexuals
being denied visitation rights.  It's a non-issue manufactured
to foster the &quot;victim&quot; image that homosexuals use to
advance their agenda.

<p>

<b>Military security studies.</b> During the debate over gays
in the military, the government unveiled a study that included
a chapter on the moral history of America.  It was full of anti-religious
sentiment and was written by a man who sits on the board of a
journal that promotes man-boy sex.

<p>

<b>Gay parenting studies.</b> Conducted and evaluated by lesbians
or homosexuals, these studies have major problems, but even so,
indicate that children in homosexual households are four times
more likely to identify as homosexual or get involved in homosexual
behavior than children raised in single-parent households.

<p>

I could go on.  Suffice to say, America is being fed a diet of
propaganda that has gone largely unexamined by major media.  The
point is to create the falsehood that homosexuality is normal,
healthy and of no consequence, and should be accorded the same
treatment in the law as benign characteristics such as skin color
or ethnicity.

<p>

The language of gay rights is tolerance, but the aim is raw power
to criminalize dissent from the view that &quot;gay is good.&quot;
In the name of freedom, this agenda must be exposed and halted.
A good place to start would be the passage of the Defense of
Marriage Act.

<title>THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT: AN INSIDER'S VIEW</title>

<h2>THE<br>
DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT:<br>
AN INSIDER'S VIEW</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Anthony Falzarano</i></center>

<p>

<i>This speech was given at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense Of Marriage Act (DOMA).  The briefing was
sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

My name is Anthony Falzarano.  I am the executive director of
Transformation Ex-Gay Christian Ministries of Washington, D.C.
We are the Washington, D.C.-affiliate of the largest ex-gay network
in the world, Exodus International, which is based in San Rafael,
California.

<p>

I am here this morning standing in solidarity with the rest of
my colleagues to voice my strong approval of The Defense of Marriage
Act (more commonly known as DOMA).  I really find it incredible
that this bill would even have to come before the halls of Congress.
For many years the term &quot;marriage&quot; never had to be
defined because this country was founded on Judeo-Christian beliefs.
Our founding fathers looked to our heavenly Creator for His definition
of marriage in the pages of the Holy Scriptures in the following:
Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:5, Mark 10:7, and Ephesians 5:31.  It's
a sad day for America when we would even have to debate this issue
publicly.  The United States of America has taken a dangerous
moral nosedive in the last 35 years and it's about time that we
say &quot;enough is enough&quot; to the enemies of this country
that we have allowed to infiltrate the halls of Congress with
their voices of destruction.

<p>

The politically-motivated homosexual movement in this country
has stepped over the line.  This movement is extremely well funded
and well connected.  It has been working for the last 30 years
like an army of termites, secretly eating away the floorboards
of moral integrity in this country.  It is time to expose the
agenda of these gay political organizations and call them what
they are -- evil.  The gay community shocked us in the 1970s by
coming out of the closet, gained our sympathy in the 1980s with
the horrible pandemic called AIDS and is now trying to force our
acceptance of their lifestyle using the legal system of this country.

<p>

I speak to you today not just as an observer of this movement,
but as one of them.  I am a former homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle
from the time I was 17 until I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle
thinking that there really wasn't any choice for me.  What I didn't
realize is that, although I didn't choose to be homosexual, I
did not have to be gay.  I had a choice.  I could change my orientation
from gay to straight.  My healing process was a long and difficult
one.  However, change is possible.  The four national ex-gay networks
are currently ministering to more than 10,000 former homosexuals.
Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle that initially seems
very freeing but eventually puts us in all kinds of bondage and
eventually will kill us.  I have lost over 35 of my friends and
acquaintances to the disease of AIDS and don't want to see one
more person become infected with this deadly disease.  The organized
gay community is telling us that AIDS is no longer a gay disease
and although it is spreading into the heterosexual population
in this country very quickly, 61 percent of people that are coming
down with this deadly disease in the U.S. are homosexual, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.

<p>

The gay lobbyists in this country do not want DOMA to pass.  They
know that they cannot force the homosexual agenda into the organized
Christian churches in America (although they are trying), so they
are attempting to push their agenda on the American public and
the civil government using the argument that &quot;they are being
discriminated against.&quot;  I say that their cries of discrimination
have been grossly exaggerated.  When I was a homosexual, as long
as I didn't push my lifestyle into the face of my landlord, no
one kept me from getting an apartment.  As long as I didn't push
my sexual preference into the face of my employer, no one ever
denied me a job.

<p>

America must take a very strong stand against the very highly
organized gay community in this country by supporting The Defense
of Marriage Act.  If we don't say &quot;no&quot; to the organized
gay community now, the United States will suffer the consequences
of our complacency.  America needs to start helping homosexuals
recover from their sexual brokenness.  Putting a stamp of approval
on a lifestyle by legally recognizing it (and even calling it
marriage) is not really helping homosexuals.  It's perpetuating
a myth and delivering them over to a deathstyle.  Just take a
look back into the history books, when homosexuality was openly
accepted into the civil governments of the Greeks and Romans.
Shortly thereafter God passed judgment on those civilizations
and they ceased to exist.  Please don't allow history to repeat
itself.  America isn't bleeding spiritually, it's hemorrhaging.
Please don't allow history to repeat itself.

<title>STATEMENT ON HOMOSEXUALITY</title>

<h2>STATEMENT ON HOMOSEXUALITY</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Jeffrey B. Satinover, M.D.</center>

<p>

This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act. The briefing was sponsored
by the Family Research Council.</i>

<br><br><br><p><center>

<i>In this age, in this country, public sentiment is everything. With it,<br>
nothing can fail; against it, nothing can succeed. Whoever molds<br>
public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes, or<br>
pronounces judicial decisions.</i>

<p>

-- Abraham Lincoln

</center><p>

On July 15, 1993, National Public Radio made a dramatic announcement
on stations across the country -- a team of scientists at the
National Institutes of Health had perhaps found the gene that
causes homosexuality. Their report would be published the next
day in <I>Science,</I> the most prestigious scientific research
journal in the world.[1]

<p>

The discussion that followed explained for the listening public
the implications of these findings for social attitudes toward
homosexuality and for public policy concerning it. Science had
proven what many had long argued -- that homosexuality is innate,
genetic and therefore unchangeable; a normal and commonplace variant
of human nature. In the light of these findings, only the bigoted
or ignorant could condemn it in any way.

<p>

Shortly after the announcement, amidst a blizzard of press discussions,
the study was highlighted in the watershed legal battle over &quot;Amendment
2.&quot; This popularly-enacted legislation precluded making sexual
orientation the basis of &quot;privileged class&quot; minority
status. Recently, Amendment 2 was overturned by the U. S. Supreme
largely because opposition to homosexuality was argued by the
court to have no substantive basis -- it was but an &quot;irrational
animus.&quot; The Court's argument was quite consistent with the
way that studies such as this were now being understood.

<p>

Among the many crucial issues raised by the legislation was the
question of whether homosexuality was indeed normal, innate and
unchangeable. Certainly, the message promulgated by NPR's report
on this research, and by all the discussions that followed, was
that it was indeed innate and unchangeable. In a few weeks, 
<I>Newsweek</I> would emblazon across its cover the
phrase that would stick in the public mind as the final truth
about homosexuality: &quot;Gay Gene?&quot;

<p>

Of course, just near the end of the NPR discussion, certain necessary
caveats were fleetingly added. But only an expert knew what they
meant -- that the research actually showed nothing whatever in
the way of what was being discussed. The vast majority of listeners
would think that homosexuality had been proven nearly conclusively
to be &quot;genetic.&quot; But is there such a &quot;gay gene&quot;?
In fact, the researchers responsible for this and other studies
being put forth as supporting such a claim, clearly acknowledge
that it does not -- but you need to be a scientist to understand
why and what <I>is</I> meant by the studies. Here is the nub of
the matter: <I>Almost every human behavioral trait -- homosexuality
included -- is &quot;heritable.&quot; Almost none are &quot;genetic&quot;
or are &quot;inherited.&quot;</I> Is this a contradiction?

<p>

In fact, it isn't, but most people will assume that the two statements
mean the same thing when they actually mean very different things.
All the touted studies to date confirm that, like everything else
in human personality, homosexuality is &quot;at least somewhat
heritable.&quot; None come even close to suggesting that it is
genetic (or inherited).

<p>

When it comes to questions of the genetics of any behavior, homosexuality
included, all of the following statements are likely to be at
least roughly true:

<p><ol>

<li>&quot;Such-and-such&quot; a behavior is &quot;genetic&quot;
<li>There are no genes that produce the behavior
<li>The genes associated with the behavior are found on such and
such a chromosome
<li>The behavior is significantly heritable
<li>The behavior is not inherited

</ol><p>

The scientific distinctions that make these seeming-contradictions
perfectly reasonable and consistent are at best completely misunderstood
by the media who reports on them.

<p>

In response to the &quot;gay gene&quot; research, <I>The Wall
Street Journal</I> headlined their report (which appeared the
next day), &quot;Research Points Toward a Gay Gene.&quot;[2] A subheading
of the <I>Journal</I> article stated, &quot;Normal Variation,&quot;
leaving the casual reader with the impression that the research
led to this conclusion. It did not, nor could it have. The subhead
alluded to nothing more than one researcher's personal, unsubstantiated
<I>opinion</I> that homosexuality, as he put it, &quot;is a normal
variant of human behavior.&quot; Even <I>The New York Times</I>,
in its more moderate front-page article, &quot;Report Suggests
Homosexuality is Linked to Genes&quot; noted that researchers
warned against overinterpreting the work, &quot;or in taking it
to mean anything as simplistic as that the 'gay gene' had been
found.&quot; (In October of 1995, the whole process repeated itself
when the same author published a follow-up study.)

<p>

At end of the <I>Journal</I> article, at the bottom of the last
paragraph on the last page deep within the paper, a prominent
geneticist was quoted for his reactions to the research. He observed
that &quot;the gene . . . may be involved in something other than
sexual behavior. <I>For example, it may be that the supposed gene
is only 'associated' with homosexuality, rather than a 'cause'
of it</I>.&quot;

<p>

This rather cryptic comment would be most difficult to understand
without the needed background. Yet it is the most critical distinction
in the entire article <I>and is the central issue in the entire
question</I>. Why bury and fail to explain what it means? Perhaps
the motives were innocent, but in fact, the belief that homosexuality
is &quot;biological&quot; or &quot;genetic&quot; causes people
to develop more positive attitudes toward it. They need not have
the foggiest understanding of what &quot;biological&quot; or 
&quot;genetic&quot; really mean:

<p><blockquote>

<i>105 volunteer[s]... were exposed to one of three... conditions....
[T]he experimental group read a summary... emphasizing a biological
component of homosexual orientation.... [O]ne control group
read a summary... focusing on the absence of hormonal differences
between homosexual and heterosexual men. [A]nother control group
w[as] not exposed to either article.... As predicted, subjects
in the experimental group had significantly lower[3] scores [more
positive attitudes toward homosexuals] than subjects in the control
groups.</i>[4]

</blockquote><p>

And:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Analysis indicated that subjects who believed that homosexuals
are &quot;born that way&quot; held significantly more positive
attitudes toward homosexuals than subjects who believed that homosexuals
&quot;choose to be that way&quot; and/or &quot;learn to be that
way.&quot;</i>[5]

</blockquote><p>

What was actually going in the study the media was trumpeting?
The research in question was a variety of behavioral genetics
study now becoming widespread -- the so-called &quot;linkage study.&quot;
Researchers identify a behavioral trait that runs in a family
and then look to see whether there is a chromosomal variant in
the genetic material of that family, and if that variant is more
frequent in the family members who have the trait.

<p>

To the uninitiated, a positive finding (&quot;correlation&quot;
or &quot;association&quot; of a genetic structure with a behavioral
trait) is taken to mean that the trait &quot;is genetic.&quot;
<I>In fact, it means absolutely nothing of the sort, and there
is virtually no human trait without innumerable such correlations.</I>
We will see shortly just how this is can be so. The most important
take-home messages will be these:

<p>

(1) All the research that has been done on homosexuality seems
as though selectively trumpeted through the press in order to
shape public opinion -- hence public policy -- in predictable
ways. The research itself means almost nothing.

<p>

(2) The research projects that would <I>truly</I> mean something
are scarcely being done because they would all explicitly or tacitly
lead to two currently unpopular ends: a) the uncovering of factors
<I>having nothing to do with homosexuality per se</I> (whether
environmental or temperamental) that place an individual at greater
risk for homosexuality; and b) once these factors are known, are
even suspected, the development of better methods than already
exist to reverse and prevent homosexuality.

<p>

(3) The quality of some of the research has been severely criticized
-- but this point is a distraction. Even were it superb, the findings
would still mean almost nothing. Higher-quality studies will without
question produce comparable results that mean equally little.

<p>

(4) To whatever extent this research has been good enough to generate
valid conclusions at all, these conclusions are precisely the
opposite of what is claimed in the press.

<p>

Before we talk about specifics, here is what serious scientists
think about the recent behavior-caused-by-genes research.

<p>

From <I>Science,</I> 1994:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Time and time again, scientists have claimed that particular genes
or chromosomal regions are associated with behavioral traits,
only to withdraw their findings when they were not replicated.
&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; says Yale's [Dr. Joel] Gelernter, &quot;it's
hard to come up with many findings linking specific genes
to complex human behaviors that have been replicated.&quot;...
All were announced with great fanfare; all were greeted unskeptically
in the popular press; all are now in disrepute.</i>[6]

</blockquote><p>

A scientist at Washington University School of Medicine calculated
what would be required for a confirmatory replication. He:

<p><blockquote>

<i>...projected that if the trait [in question] was 50 percent heritable...
detecting [just] one of [its] genes would require studying 175
families -- that is, almost 2000 people.[7] Replicati[on] would require
studying 781 families -- another 8000 people.... [E]ach additional
gene (for a polygenic trait), researchers would need... the
whole business again. &quot;Suddenly you're talking about tens
of thousands of people and years of work and millions of 
dollars.&quot;</i>[8]

</blockquote><p>

Using arguable-at-best methods, two American activists recently
published studies showing that if one of a pair of identical twins
is homosexual, the odds that the other one is, too, are more than
50 percent. On this basis, they argue that &quot;homosexuality
is genetic.&quot; British researchers generated comparable results
in a similar study. Their conclusion? The surprisingly low odds
that both twins were homosexual:

<p><blockquote>

<i>confirmed that genetic factors are insufficient explanation for
the development of sexual orientation.</i>[9]

</blockquote><p>

Two Columbia University researchers (who have published the most
comprehensive research summary on the subject to date) note the
unexpectedly:

<p><blockquote>

<i>... large proportion of monozygotic twins who [did not share]
homosexuality despite sharing not only their genes but also their
prenatal and familial environments.[10] The... [50 percent odds]...
for homosexuality among the identical twins could be entirely
accounted for by the increased similarity of their developmental
experiences. In my opinion, the major finding of that study is
that 48 percent of identical twins who were reared together [and
where at least one was homosexual] were discordant for sexual
orientation.</i>[11]

</blockquote><p>

Two other genetics researchers (one heads one of the largest genetics
departments in the country, the other is at Harvard) comment:

<p><blockquote>

<i>... recent studies seeking a genetic basis for homosexuality
suggests that... we may be in for a new molecular phrenology,
rather than true scientific progress and insight into behavior.

<p>

While the authors interpreted their findings as evidence for a
genetic basis for homosexuality, we think that the data in fact
provide strong evidence for the influence of the environment.</i>[12]

</blockquote><p>

The author of the lead article on genes and behavior in a special
issue of <I>Science</I> notes:

<p><blockquote>

<i>... the growing understanding that the interaction of genes and
environment is much more complicated than the simple &quot;violence
genes&quot; and &quot;intelligence genes&quot; touted in the popular
press. Indeed, <I>renewed appreciation of environmental factors
is one of the chief effects of the increased belief in genetics'
effects on behavior</I> [My emphasis]. The same data that show
the effects of genes also point to the enormous influence of non-genetic
factors.</i>[13]

</blockquote><p>

The director of the Center for Developmental and Health Genetics
at Pennsylvania State University comments:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;Research into heritability is the best demonstration I know
of the importance of the environment.&quot;</i>

</blockquote><p>

(Note the term &quot;heritability.&quot; We will be returning
to it in detail as it lies at the heart of much confusion).

<p>

With regard to Hamer's work on what the press calls &quot;the
gay gene,&quot; genetics researchers from Yale, Columbia and Louisiana
State Universities noted that:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Much of the discussion of [Hamer's et al.] finding [of a purported
gene locus for homosexuality] has focused on its social and political
ramifications. [But] inconsistencies... suggest that this finding
should be interpreted cautiously....

<p>

[Hamer's et al.] results are not consistent with any genetic model....neither
of these differences [between homosexuality in maternal versus
paternal uncles or cousins] is statistically significant....small
sample sizes make these data compatible with a range of hypotheses.

<p>

[T]he... data... present no consistent support for the results.</i>[14]

</blockquote><p>

It does not seem to have been widely reported that Hamer responded
carefully, and accurately, to his fellow scientists, as follows:

<p><blockquote>

<i>We did not say that [the chromosome segment under study] 
&quot;underlies&quot; sexuality, only that it contributes to it in 
some families. Nor have we said that [it] represents a &quot;major&quot; 
gene, only that its influence is statistically detectable in the 
population that we studied.</i>[15]

</blockquote><p>

Setting aside possible flaws in the research, would the findings
actually point to this more modest claim with any degree of certainty?
In fact, they don't -- as Hamer himself acknowledges, but in language
that will surely evade general understanding -- and that is likely
(because of its complexity) to be avoided by the press:

<p><blockquote>

<i>the question of the appropriate significance level to apply to
a non-Mendelian trait such as sexual orientation is problematic.</i>[16]

</blockquote><p>

English translation: &quot;It is not possible to know what the
findings mean, if anything, since sexual orientation can't be
inherited the way eye-color is.&quot; The bottom line, in his
words, is what serious researchers know, but the public doesn't:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Complex behavioral traits are the product of multiple genetic
and environmental antecedents, with 'environment' meaning not
only the social environment but also such factors as the 'flux
of hormones during development, whether you were lying on your
right or left side in the womb and a whole parade of other things'...the
relationships among genes and environment probably have a somewhat
different effect on someone in Salt Lake City than if that person
were growing up in New York City.</i>[17]

</blockquote><p>

English translation: You're more likely to become gay growing
up in Manhattan than in Utah among Mormons and Christian fundamentalists,
even if everything else is the same, including genes.

<p>

Activists are readily able to feed the public what they wish only
in part because of an easily-led or poorly-educated press. The
major reason is really that the ideas being distorted beyond recognition
once they leave the labs are inherently complex, even when presented
properly. There are no &quot;lite,&quot; sound-bite versions that
aren't fundamentally in error in one way or another.

<p>

Nonetheless, if one grasps at least some of the basics, in simple
form, it will be possible to see exactly why the current research
into homosexuality means so little -- and will continue to mean
little even should the quality of the research methods improve
-- so long as it remains driven by politics.

<p>

<center><h3>TWO BASIC PRINCIPLES</h3></center>

<p>

There are really only two major principles that need to be carefully
assimilated in order to see through public relations distortions
to the actual meaning of recent research. They are as follows:

<p><ol>

<li><I>Heritable</I> does not mean <I>inherited</I>.

<p>

<li>Meaningful genetics research identifies and then focuses on
traits that <I>are</I> directly inherited.

</ol><p>

Let's begin with the first point -- that <I>heritable</I> does
not mean <I>inherited</I>.

<p>

<I>Heritability</I> studies can be done on almost any human trait
-- physical, behavioral, emotional, etc. -- and will show positive
results. That is, almost every human characteristic you can think
of is in some measure <I>heritable</I>. But few human behavioral
traits are directly <I>inherited</I> the way simple physiological
traits are (e.g., eye color).

<p>

&quot;Inherited&quot; means &quot;determined directly by genes,&quot;
with little or no way of changing the trait by choice, or by preventing
it, or by modifying the environment in which the trait has emerged
(or is more likely to emerge).

<p>

Here is a hypothetical example, but it is 100 percent plausible.
It tracks the kinds of studies that have been done with innumerable
other traits, including homosexuality. (But only in the area of
homosexuality has the meaning of such studies been so badly distorted.)

<p>

Suppose that for political reasons you want to demonstrate that
there is a &quot;basketball gene&quot; that &quot;makes&quot;
people become basketball players -- BBPs. (Suspend your intuitive
sense that the idea is absurd.) To make your case, you would use
the same research methods as with homosexuality. These methods
fall into three categories, and represent important preliminary
research when investigating any trait:

<p><ul>

(a) twin studies

<p>

(b) brain dissections

<p>

(c) gene &quot;linkage&quot; studies

</ul><p>

<b>(a) Twin Studies</b>

<p>

The basic idea in twin studies is to show that the more genetically
similar are two people, the more likely it is that they will share
the trait you're studying. So, you create a study set of pairs
of people, divided into categories according to how genetically
similar they are, as follows.

<p><hr><p>

<center><pre>
<b>Pair Type                   Degree of Genetic Similarity</b>
<b>                            (% same genes)              </b>

<i><b>Identical Twins</b></i>                    100%                 
<i><b>Fraternal (Non-identical) Twins</b></i>     50%                 
<i><b>Non-Twin Brothers or Sisters</b></i>        50%                 
<i><b>Unrelated People</b></i>                    &lt;5%                 

</pre></center>

<p><hr><p>

The most similar are identical twins, the next most similar are
fraternal twins (who are on average as different as non-twin brothers
or sisters, but no more so), the least similar are unrelated people.

<p>

Then you identify those pairs of twins in which at least one is
a BBP. It will not be difficult to show that if one such identical
twin is a BBP, his brother (or her sister) more frequently will
be, too, than would a non-identical twin or a non-twin sibling
or a non-sibling. You would create groups of such different kinds
of pairs to make the comparison in a large number of cases. (One
set of identical twin pairs, one set of non-identical twin pairs,
one set of non-twin siblings, and so on.) From the &quot;concordance
rate&quot; in each set (the percentage of pairs in each set in
which either both are BBPs or both aren't. Pairs in which one
was and the other wasn't would be called &quot;discordant for
BBP&quot;) you would calculate a &quot;heritability&quot; rate.
(Perhaps you have an armchair guess as to how many identical twin-pairs
either <I>both</I> play or <I>both</I> don't play basketball.
Probably a good deal more than half, the concordance rate for
homosexuality in such twin-pairs.)

<p>

You respond to the reporter from <I>Sports Illustrator</I> that
&quot;our research demonstrates that BBP is very strongly heritable,&quot;
and you'd be right. But the article that comes out that month
reads something slightly different, but completely wrong. &quot;&#133;
recent research shows that basketball playing is probably inherited.
A number of outside researchers examined the work and found it
substantially accurate and well-performed. They cautioned against
arriving at hasty conclusions, however.&quot; No one notices the
difference.

<p>

Thus, the authors of a widely-reported set of twin studies describe
their intent to alter &quot;public sentiment&quot; as follows:

<p><blockquote>

<i>These studies were designed to detect heritable variation, and
if it was present, to counter the prevalent belief that sexual
orientation is largely the product of family interactions and
the social environment.</i>[18]

</blockquote><p>

But they themselves acknowledge in their own paper that:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Although male and female homosexuality appear to be at least somewhat
heritable, environment must also be of considerable importance
in their origins.</i>[19]

</blockquote><p>

<b>(b) Brain Dissections</b>

<p>

Second, your colleagues perform a series of autopsies on the brains
of some dead people who appear to have been BBPs. (Old jerseys,
high-top sneakers and Knick's ticket-stubs were found among their
possessions, for example.) They do the same with a group of dead
non-players (no sneakers, jerseys or tickets.) They report that,
on average, &quot;certain parts of the brain long thought to be
involved with BBP are much larger in the group of BBPs than in
the controls.&quot; Certain nationally-renowned newspapers in
the Northeast pick up on the story and editorialize, &quot;It
will be very difficult for anyone except poorly-educated yokels
who believe in Santa Claus, the Tooth-Fairy and God to argue that
basketball playing isn't inborn. For not only has it been proven
to run in families, even the <I>brains</I> of basketball players
are different.&quot;

<p>

In a pretense of balance, some of these papers interview die-hard
believers in the old view -- yokels who still think that one must
decide to play basketball, and play it for a long time, before
you really can be considered &quot;a BBP.&quot; One of them is
quoted as claiming that &quot;maybe if you do something long enough
your brain changes as you get better at it, and that part of the
brain gets bigger.&quot; (Remarkably enough, this surmise seems
obvious to the old-time believer.) The reporter doesn't merely
report the comment, however, he also hints that it's especially
idiotic -- typical of die-hards and yokels -- since everyone knows
the brain doesn't change. For example, with regard to homosexuality,
<I>The Wall Street Journal</I> chided:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Some religious fundamentalists even suggested that homosexual
activity somehow could have caused the structural differences
[in the brain].</i>[20]

</blockquote><p>

Of course, you yourself are well-aware that among neuroscientists
it is extremely old news that the brain indeed changes, quite
dramatically, in just the way the old die-hard guessed: those
parts responsible for an activity get much, much bigger over time
(and there are definitely parts that are more utilized in BBP.
Similarly:

<p><blockquote>

<i>... in individuals who became blind as adults and then learned
Braille, the part of the brain governing the right index finger
became progressively enlarged.)</i>[21]

</blockquote><p>

Thus, the editor of <I>Nature,</I> the world's most eminent scientific
journal (the British counterpart to <I>Science</I>) remarked on
this research that:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Plainly, the neural correlates of genetically determined gender
are plastic at a sufficiently early stage. . . . Plastic structures
in the hypothalamus allowing the consequences of early sexual
arousal to be made permanent might suit [those who claim an environmental
origin to homosexuality] well.</i>[22]

</blockquote><p>

<b>(c) Gene &quot;Linkage&quot; Studies</b>

<p>

Now for the <I>coup de grace</I>. You find a couple of families
of BBPs and compare them to some families of non-BBPs. You have
a hunch that of innumerable genes of every imaginable sort likely
to be &quot;associated&quot; or &quot;linked&quot; to BBP (you
never use the word &quot;causing&quot; because you don't need
to -- no one knows the difference), there are some genes on, say,
the X-Chromosome. After a few false starts, sure enough, you find
what you're looking for: among the BBP families is more commonly
found (though not always) one particular chromosomal variant (cluster
of genes) than among the non-players.

<p>

Now, sympathizers in the press were long-ago quietly informed
of your research, since they want people to come around to certain
beliefs, too. So, as soon as your work hits the press, they're
on the air: &quot;Researchers are hot on the trail of the 'Basketball
Gene!' In an article to be published tomorrow in <I>Sports Science</I>....
&quot; Learned-sounding commentators muse about the enormous public
policy implications of this superb piece of 
science-in-the-service-of-humankind. Two weeks later, there it is 
again, at a jaunty angle across the cover of the major national 
newsweekly: &quot;Basketball Gene.&quot;

<p>

Now what's wrong with this scenario? It's simple: of course BBP
is <I>heritable</I> (&quot;has a non-zero <I>heritability</I>&quot;
to use the words of genetics researchers). That's because many
physiological traits, such as muscle strength, speed, agility,
reflex speed, height, etc., are themselves directly <I>inherited</I>,
and they make it more or less likely that one can, and will want
to, and will successfully, and will therefore continue to want
to, and will, in fact, continue to, play basketball. In short,
because of intermediate <I>inherited</I> traits <I>associated</I>
with BBP (none of which <I>are</I> BBP), it shows significant
<I>heritability</I>. (The genetic <I>association</I>, of course,
is in no way necessary or predetermined, and is highly 
culturally-conditioned: there were no BBPs at all in, say, ancient 
Greece, yet the same genes were there.)

<p>

BBP also shows a strong <I>biological representation in
the brain,</I> both at birth (e.g., nervous system factors contributing
to reflex speed) and especially later (e.g., the parts of the
cortex that are cultivated and become responsible for the movements
of basketball).

<p>

And the specific genes that run in families that are responsible
for height, athleticism, etc. can surely be found and they will
be statistically <I>linked</I> to BBP. If one identical twin decides
to play basketball, the unusually strong emotional bond between
such siblings will make it even more likely that his twin will,
too. (The fact of their genetic <I>identity</I>, not their specific
genes, is here influencing an outcome above and beyond the indirect
contributions from any specific genes.)

<p>

The basic problem is this: BBP is &quot;influenced&quot; (made
more or less an easy and enjoyable thing to do) by the presence
or absence of other associated traits. For BBP we can readily
guess what they are and so immediately see that the &quot;genetic&quot;
component of BBP has nothing to do with the game itself but with
these associated (facilitating) traits. What are these traits?
Height, athleticism, bone structure, reflexes, muscle refresh
rate, and so on. So obvious are the specifics of this association
that no one will waste his time looking into the genetics of BBP
proper. They willconcentrate on the obvious intermediate traits
-- height, athleticism, and so on.

<p>

The same is true for homosexuality, except (a) the more important,
intermediate traits with which it is associated are mostly unknown
and suspected ones are harder to confirm and (b) the research
agenda seems diverted by the political requirement that no such
associated traits be discovered and that homosexuality be presented
as directly inherited.

<p>

Good genetics research must identify and then focus on traits
that are directly inherited. Research into merely <I>heritable</I>
traits is useful only in generating hypotheses about what the
directly inherited traits might be. Here's what this means:

<p>

Let's imagine that it wasn't immediately evident to us that the
heritable aspects of BBP were intermediate traits such as height.
A good researcher would not be at all tempted to conclude from
the studies we described that BBP itself was inherited. He would
conclude however that, indeed, there must be some inherited traits
that facilitate BBP, and it would be these as-yet-unknown traits
that were producing the &quot;non-zero heritability&quot; results.
If he could identify the traits correctly, <I>he would find that
the heritability results, when he redirected his genetics research,
would increase dramatically.</I> 

<p>

In other words, studying the genetics of BBP is really a crude
way of unwittingly studying the genetics of height and athleticism.
If he selects his population on the basis of the indirect trait
(BBP), when it is other traits that are really inherited, his
results will be &quot;fuzzed up&quot; by the inevitable proportion
of BBP's who lack these traits, or have them in lesser degree.
But if he correctly identifies the traits in question, his next
round of studies will &quot;divide the herd&quot; more efficiently,
corralling his subjects not by BBP (or &quot;sexual orientation&quot;),
but by height. Of course, there will be more BBPs among the tall
subjects than among the short, but that's incidental. He will
seek out other tall people who aren't BBPs, and in his new study,
the heritability factor (height) will be even more concentrated.

<p>

How might he guess at what the most important traits are, and
then try to confirm his guess, so he could investigate the genetics
of these traits? Very simply. He looks, does the best he can to
name what he sees, and tries not to run afoul of any currently-fashionable
taboos. He'll probably have no trouble studying height, but he
might run into difficulties if he thinks that athleticism (or
even height) has a racial association. (More people of Nordic
stock, being taller, are likely to become basketball players than
do people of Appenzeller Swiss stock, being short. Perhaps other
such groupings might occur to a researcher.)

<p>

In the case of homosexuality, the <I>inherited</I> traits that
are more common among homosexuals (and that produce &quot;non-zero
<I>heritability</I>&quot; in studies) might include such qualities
as greater than average tendency to anxiety, shyness, sensitivity,
intelligence, aesthetic abilities and so on. (Of course, these
traits may themselves be further reducible to a variety of 
mutually-influencing, associated genetic and non-genetic factors.) 
The brain changes that are more prevalent among homosexuals, the 
increased tendency of homosexuality to run in families (and to vary 
with degree of genetic similarity within families) and the presence 
of associated chromosomal markings are all certainly due to as yet 
unresearched and therefore not-yet-identified intermediate traits. 
There is <I>no</I> evidence that homosexuality itself is inherited.

<p>

Like height and BBP, these traits -- intelligence, say, or anxiety
-- are surely widely distributed in the population at large and
densely present therefore in groups that are properly selected
to have them. If researchers had divided their population by shyness
or aesthetic sensibility, and ignored the homosexual-non-homosexual
division they might well have found even stronger chromosomal
linkages and heritability.

<p>

<center><h3>CHANGE</h3></center>

<p>

The effect on &quot;public sentiment&quot; of the widely-believed
but unsubstantiated claim that &quot;homosexuality is inherited&quot;
is to convince people that it is unchangeable. That people wrestling
with homosexuality sincerely and accurately have detected homosexual
impulses in themselves since childhood lends credence to the 
&quot;innate&quot; argument. But if, as the evidence strongly 
suggests, homosexuality is not inherited (even if deeply embedded, and 
far from a simple choice), the converse should be true -- it should be 
changeable.

<p>

Indeed, a dispassionate examination of more than 50 years of research
in homosexual change confirms that it is changeable in just the
way that deeply embedded impulses are: with difficulty, and in
the absence of a consistent long-term program of unbiased research,
with less than 100 percent but very significant success. As the
following studies suggest, many including long-term follow-up,
success rates above 50 percent are already achievable. There is
every reason to expect that a purposeful, well-supported program
of research could achieve considerably more.

<center><h3>Conclusions</h3></center>

<p>

Two profoundly mistaken ideas have sunk deeply into public sentiment
where they exert a powerful influence in the shaping of public
policy as it relates to family, sexuality and marriage. These
are:

<p><ol>

<li>That homosexuality &quot;is genetic,&quot; and that, consequently;
<li>Homosexuality is unchangeable.

</ol><p>

Neither idea is true, and in fact there is substantial scientific
evidence to the contrary. There are two groups of Americans being
severely harmed by the propagation of these untruths:

<ol><p>

<li>The very large number of homosexuals who wish nothing more
than to rid themselves of these unwanted impulses and establish
quiet marriages and families. The gay and lesbian activism that
claims to speak for all homosexuals speaks for these many struggling
fellow citizens in no way whatsoever. Even more completely ignored
are the very large number of people who have already successfully
negotiated this difficult, but extraordinarily rewarding, passage.

<p>

<li>The rising generation of youngsters, an ever-growing proportion
of whom -- because of the rapidly deteriorating family -- are
at risk for profound identity confusion of every sort, sexual
as well. If our children are not correctly instructed as to the
true possibilities for homosexual change, as well as of its nature,
many will be misguided into accepting a way of life which, in
they end, they do no want, and which is in conflict with their
most cherished private beliefs.

</ol><p>

Perhaps even more troubling is this: Epidemiologists around the
country have confirmed that among young gay men there is a significant
return to the unsafest of sexual practices in spite of more than
15 years of massively-funded education programs. Multiple studies
at centers around the country suggest that a shocking 30 percent
of all currently 20-year-old young men who identify themselves
as &quot;gay&quot; will be either HIV-positive or dead of AIDS
by the time they are 30 years of age.[32]

<p>

Yet, as is indicated by recent research, many of these young men
will spontaneously leave homosexuality behind, and formal outcome
studies in homosexual change from before the political chill show
average success rates from a variety of psychotherapeutic (talk
only) treatment modalities (including long term follow-up) of
more than 50 percent. Even were the change rate but 10 percent,
that alone would save the lives of 30 out of every 1000 such young
men.

<title>THE IMPLICATIONS OF GAY 'MARRIAGE'</title>

<h2>THE IMPLICATIONS OF<br>
GAY 'MARRIAGE'</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Hadley Arkes</center>

<p>

This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing 
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  The briefing was 
sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

During the hearings on the 
Defense of Marriage Act in May, Congressman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) posed
the rhetorical but earnest question:  Were he and his partner,
&quot;Herb&quot; -- settled, domesticated couple that they were
-- really imperilling the marriages of people in their neighborhood?
How could their example, as a gay couple, injure the institution
of marriage?  Had there been some decline, after all, in the attraction
of the sexes, so that men might cease being attracted to women
if they were suddenly more aware of gay men together as couples?
That would appear, on the surface, a plausible question, but
it masks a serious confusion about the standards of judgment or
evidence in assessing the problem.  We might as aptly ask whether
there would be any measurable fraying in the community if a brother
and sister took up residence as husband and wife.  Years ago,
in Stafford, Virginia, a 40-year-old mother was living in a common
law marriage with her 19-year-old son.  They were ordered by a
court to part, and as far as we know, their example produced no
breakdown of marriages in the town.  No one expects the sky to
fall in, or the local populace to break out in fits of stuttering.
That is not the test, and that is not the issue.

<p>

The question of what is suitable for marriage is quite separate from 
the matter of love, though it cannot finally be detached from love. 
No one doubts the love of men for men, or women for women, just as no
one doubts that there may be abiding relations of love between
brothers and sisters, grandparents and grandchildren.  In the
nature of things, nothing in those relations of love could possibly
be diminished in any way if they were not attended by penetration
or expressed in marriage.

<p>

As I remarked at the hearings in May,
it becomes impossible finally to discuss this matter of marriage
and sexuality without using the N-word:  nature.  The question
must return to that sexuality stamped in our natures, or what
has been called the &quot;natural teleology of the body&quot;
--  namely, the inescapable fact that only two people, not three,
only a man and a woman, can beget a child.  We don't need a marriage
to mark the presence of love, but a marriage marks something matchless
in a framework for the begetting and nurturance of children.
Even on those occasions when marriages break down, the framework
of law has the advantage at least of fixing responsibility for
the custody and care of children.

<p>

I posed then a question of principle
for the Committee on the Judiciary in this way:  If marriage were
detached from that natural teleology of the body, <i>on what ground
of principle could the law confine marriage to &quot;couples&quot;?</i>
If the law permitted the marriage of people of the same sex,
what is the ground of principle on which the law would refuse
to recognize a &quot;marriage&quot; in the people who profess
that their own love is not confined to a coupling of two, but
connected in a larger cluster of three or four?  The confining
of marriage to two may stand out then as nothing more than the
most arbitrary fixation on numbers.  But if that arrangement of
plural partners were permitted to people of the same sex, how
could it be denied in principle to ensembles of mixed sexes?
That is to say, we would be back, in principle, to the acceptance
of polygamy.

<p>

I sought to be clear, also, in the discussion
in the Judiciary Committee that I was not making a prediction
-- I was not predicting that, if we accepted same-sex marriage,
we would be engulfed by polygamy and incest.  I was a raising
question, again, of principle:  What was the ground on which the
law refused to accept the polygamous union once it accepted the
notion of gay marriage?  It could not be, &quot;That is not what
we do here,&quot; for that answer would suffice right now.  One
young legislator, testifying before the Committee, was pressed
on this matter of polygamy, and he replied that he simply understood
marriage as an exclusive contractual relation between two people.
Others might come back and retort that we happen to consider
marriage an exclusive, contractual relation between a man and
a woman.  On the level of assertion, one meets another;  but neither
one states a ground of principle for denying same-sex marriage
-- once marriage is detached, as I say, from its defining ground
in nature.

<p>

I would go further and say that I take Congressman
Frank and other gay activists at their word when they declare
that they do not wish to injure the family.  I credit their avowals
about their attachments to their own families, and their wish
that other people in the country may have the blessings of that
life in a family.  But the problem here, as I sought to explain,
was that their argument ran well beyond their intentions.  Those
arguments must put in place the kinds of premises and understandings
that make it impossible to reject any longer the claims for polygamy.
To put it another way, every argument for gay marriage is an
argument that would support polygamy.  The gay activists may not
have the remotest interest in promoting polygamy, but this much
may fairly be said:  They have the most profound interest, rooted
in the logic of their doctrine, in discrediting the notion that
marriage finds its defining ground in &quot;nature.&quot;  Their
rhetorical strategy, their public arguments, have all been directed
explicitly to the derision of that claim that sexuality in the
strictest sense involves the sexuality &quot;imprinted in our
natures.&quot;  For that reason, we can count on the fact that
there will be someone, somewhere, ready to press this this issue
by raising a challenge in the court and testing the limits even
further.

<p>

The irony then is that the notion of marriage cannot
accommodate couples of the same sex without so altering the cast
or character of marriage that it will cease to be that special
relation, which seems to be the object of such deep craving now
for so many people.  Once the notion of marriage is broadened
in that way, it will simply not be tenable any longer to hold
up marriage, in the laws, as a relation that deserves a special
place, a special commendation -- a special effort to sustain and
promote it.  And indeed, we fear that the movement to gay marriage
is fueled in part by a desire to remove that special standing
in principle -- to deny that there is anything about marriage
that deserves a special respect, or any favored standing in the
law.  And after all, people are not drawn to the &quot;gay&quot;
life because of an overpowering interest in raising children.
The question of marriage for gays or lesbians, or rights of adoption
for gay couples, take on their importance strategically:  They
provide further occasions for moving the law to pronounce that
homosexuality is, in the current phrase, &quot;virtually normal,&quot;
that homosexuality cannot stand on any lesser plane of legitimacy
than that sexuality &quot;imprinted in our natures.&quot;

<p>

But it is worth reminding the press, and the public, as to what provided
the urgency, for the Congress, to come forth at this moment, with
the Defense of Marriage Act.  The litigation in Hawaii was percolating
for a few years, but matters moved into an alarming phase with
the argument before the Supreme Court, last October, in <i>Romer
v. Evans</i>.

<p>

When I testified before the Judiciary Committee of the
House on May 15, the decision in that case was expected any day.
It arrived five days later, on May 20th, and it was quite as
bad as many of us had anticipated.  In that decision, the Court
struck down a constitutional amendment in Colorado that refused
to treat gays and lesbians as a protected or favored class, on
the same plane as the groups that suffer discrimination based
on race or gender.  We will hear, of course, different accounts
of that case, but in my own reading, that decision will be read
by many activists among the judges to produce this lesson:  that
a State may not incorporate in its laws or public policy an adverse
judgment on homosexuality, and it may not refuse to accord to
homosexuality the same standing or legitimacy that attaches to
that sexuality &quot;imprinted in our natures.&quot;  With this
move, the Court may have armed federal judges to tie up any legislation
in a State that refused to honor homosexual marriages:  After
all, the argument might run, the State refuses to credit this
marriage only because of the gender, or the &quot;sexual orientation,&quot;
of the couple.  Would this not be, on the face, but another 
&quot;discrimination&quot; against people because they happen to be 
gays or lesbians?

<p>

As it turned out, we did not have long to wait.  This argument has
already been sounded by Professor William Eskridge of the Georgetown
University Law School (in the June 17 issue of <i>The New Republic</i>).
Several weeks ago, I taped a television program on this subject
with Professor Eskridge, who affected not to be aware then of
any such development that could undercut the authority of the
States in refusing to honor gay marriage.  In the hearings, Congressman
Frank was especially contemptuous of this bill on the ground that
it was an unnecessary extension of federal power -- that Congress
would act here to confirm to the States a power they already had.
When I pointed out the implications of the coming decision in
<i>Romer v. Evans</i>, there was no acknowledgement on the part of Frank
that he was aware of the case pending there. In a piece in <i>The
New York Times</i>, Professor Laurence Tribe affected the same want
of awareness.  Tribe joined Frank in arguing that the bill was
unjustified precisely because it was unnecessary -- that the States
would not require any prop to their authority in rejecting gay
marriage.  But now Professor Eskridge seems to have let the truth
slip.  He has made it clear that gay activists would indeed read
the Romer case in the way I've suggested, and that they can of
course be expected to cite it -- as they would cite anything else
even remotely supportive of their arguments -- as they seek to
challenge in the courts the Defense of Marriage Act.

<p>

And yet, this Act is the most delicate and limited measure that the 
Congress could produce on the subject.  It treats subjects that are 
evidently within the reach of the Congress, and it makes the least 
intrusion into the domain of State law.  What other institution could 
possibly have the authority to clarify the meaning of terms in federal
legislation, if not the federal legislature?  It surely cannot
be a novelty to make explicit what has ever been our tradition,
that marriage &quot;means only a legal union between one man and
one woman as husband and wife.&quot;  In the second sentence of
the Full Faith and Credit Clause the Constitution reads:  &quot;And
the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which
such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect
thereof.&quot;  Once again, we may ask:  If Congress may not legislate
under this federal clause, what other institution could possibly
claim the authority to legislate?  How could we legislate in any
more minimal way here than in the way the Congress has chosen
to legislate -- namely, by providing merely that no State would
be obliged to honor, as a marriage, anything but what we have
known traditionally as &quot;marriage,&quot; the legal union of
a man and a woman, as husband and wife?  As I say, it is hard
to imagine any law on the subject that moves with more delicacy
or with less intrusion into the powers of the States.  The States
that wish to honor gay marriage will suffer no restriction in
this measure.  But on other hand, this provision on the part of
Congress may supply the only ground of support for a State in
refusing to credit same-sex marriage, especially if a federal
court moves to strip from a State every other source of resistance.

<p>

In my own testimony last May, I anticipated that questions would
be raised about the power of Congress to legislate on the subject
of marriage through the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  That clause
was obviously not meant as a grant of power to Congress to legislate
more broadly on the subject of marriage, and that is the not the
power that the Congress is undertaking in this case.  I pointed
to some of the earlier flexing of congressional authority under
the Full Faith and Credit Clause, in dealing with the custody
of children and the protection of former spouses from threats
of violence.  The Clause had been used, in other words, to deal
with some of the fallout from divorce and the rupture of families,
in matters that ran beyond the powers of the States.  The same
situation would present itself here.

<p>

I suggested in my testimony
that an even more dramatic instance of the problem was supplied
in 1803, when Congress barred the shipment of slaves into any
state that itself prohibited the import of slaves.  The problem
did not arise for States in the North where slavery was prohibited,
for there was no point in shipping slaves into those States. 
The problem arose for States in the South, where slavery was protected
under the law, but where there was an effort to ban the import
of more slaves.  Under the Constitution, of course, a State could
not cast up barriers to trade across the boundaries of the States.
Only Congress had the power to regulate interstate commerce,
and so the power of Congress was called in here as an annex to
the policy of the State in forbidding the import of new slaves.
Yet, under the Constitution, Congress could exert no authority
over the import of slaves from abroad until 1808.  And it was
widely assumed that Congress had no authority to legislate directly
on slavery within the States.  Clearly, Congress was not thought
to possess the authority to legislate on the substance of slavery
within the States; it could deal only with the problem of fugitive
slaves, moving from one State to another.  But just as clearly,
Congress alone could close off the borders of a State to slaves
shipped from other States, and that authority had to be the source
then of this interstitial power to legislate on the substance
of slavery.

<p>

It seems to me that no more or less has been claimed
in this case, with the Defense of Marriage Act.  There is no way
to avoid touching upon the substance of marriage, and yet the
legislation bears all the marks of an effort simply to touch this
matter in the most minimal way.  It is evident that the drafters
assert no authority here to legislate more fully on the subject
of marriage.  The purpose, plain to any onlooker, was to make
the least intrusion into the powers of the States.

<p>

In contrast, there have been rather emphatic intimations, in other 
parts of our law, that the federal government could indeed reach far 
more widely in the domain of marriage and the family.  Chief Justice
Marshall once remarked in passing, in the Dartmouth College case
(1819) that an apt question might arise under the Contract Clause
if a State passed an act, say, &quot;annulling all marriage contracts,
or allowing either party to annul it without the consent of the
other.&quot; [<i>Dartmouth College v. Woodward</i>, 17 U.S. (4 Wheaton)
518, at 629]  When the federal courts strike down arrangements,
in the States, to assign custody to children on the basis of race,
they engage the Constitution in this matter, and with the effect
of remodelling, in substance, the laws of custody in the States.
[<i>Palmore v. Sidotti</i>, 466 U.S. 429 (1984)]  With this act in Defense
of Marriage, the Congress uses but the slightest portion of the
authority it might it claim to act in this field.  And again,
that deliberate confining of its reach must be taken as a measure
of the intent of the drafters to move with the lightest hand,
in touching nothing more than Congress needs to touch.

<p>

But as restrained, and as limited, as the reach of Congress is in this 
case, this move on the part of Congress is quite telling.  In fact, the 
studied silences in this bill, the simplicity and spareness of its moves,
serve to convey even more powerfully its significance as a legislative
act.  For it represents nothing less than a willingness of Congress
to take up again its warrant to act as an interpreter of the Constitution,
along with the courts and the Executive.  Against the concert
of  judges, remodelling on their own the laws on marriage and
the family, the Congress weighs in to supply another understanding,
and a rival doctrine.  But it happens, at the same time, to be
an ancient understanding and a traditional doctrine.  The Congress
would proclaim it again now, and suggest that the courts take
their bearings anew from this doctrine, stated anew, brought back
and affirmed by officers elected by the people.

<p>

This effort on the part of Congress to weigh in, to participate again 
in the interpretation of the Constitution, was made more urgent by the
prospect of <i>Romer v. Evans</i>, and now it has been made ever more
urgent by the advent, by the presence, of that decision in <i>Romer
v. Evans</i>. The problem of gay marriage was not the only problem
deepened by the judgment in <i>Romer</i>, and if the Congress can counter
the courts on the question of gay marriage, it would be quite
as urgent for the Congress to take this first step, to begin acting
again, for the sake of inducing the courts to limit or narrow
the holding in <i>Romer</i>.

<p>

Here we offer no arrant speculation, but
we simply follow the precise warnings cast up by Justice Scalia
in his dissenting opinion, as he began to draw out for the public
the implications of this recent decision.  As Scalia pointed out,
the Association of American Law Schools now requires all of its
members to extract this pledge from law firms that are interviewing
candidates:  that the employer will be willing to hire homosexuals.
At the same time, the Supreme Court has now declared that people
who hold to the traditional Jewish and Christian teaching on sexuality
are fueled by an irrational &quot;animus.&quot;

<p>

As far as I know, no Moral Court has managed yet to refute the traditional
Jewish and Christian teaching on this ancient problem, and yet
the Court has now pronounced that teaching to be vacuous, to be
connected to no plausible or defensible purpose.  As Scalia has
observed, the Court now declares serious Jews and Christians to
be nothing less than bigots.  And so, as we put these strands
together, is there not an incentive now, for law firms, to gauge
whether the senior partners or young associates harbor views that
may put the firm at odds with the regulations of the law schools?
While affecting no prejudice, mind you, toward people who are
serious about their religion, the law firms may nevertheless screen
out people who acknowledge their seriousness as Christians and
Jews.

<p>

The incentives will not emanate simply from the conventions
of the law schoools.  After all, if the Supreme Court itself has
now declared that a moral objection to homosexuality is indefensible,
irrational, the distillation of unreasoned prejudice or &quot;animus,&quot;
does the Court not in fact install the predicate for grievances
and litigation?  If a young, gay associate is denied standing
as a partner, could it not be claimed that the climate in the
firm was poisoned at the outset, or set in a discriminatory cast,
by the presence of senior partners who bore moral reservations
about homosexuality?  What can be said in this respect for law
firms could be said even more forcefully about the colleges and
universities.  Given the litigious experience these days in the
academy, we can virtually <b>count</b> on the fact that grievances will
be filed.  What if a member of an academic department has simply
done what I have done -- given public testimony, or published
articles, staking out a position or defending a moral judgment
on gay marriage?  Might that supply a <i>prima facie</i> ground for a
grievance later?  Might it not be argued--and will it not be argued
-- that the situation was at least biased, or tilted, at the outset
by the presence of that member of the Faculty?  Can we expect
then certain pressures, subtle and unsubtle, to separate those
members of the faculty from the decisions on tenure -- or hiring.
And might it finally be best to remove the problem at the root
simply by avoiding the hiring of people who bear these religious
and moral sentiments, which the Supreme Court has now declared
to be prejudicial and irrational, without any redeeming features?

<p>

In sum, the Court has fashioned, in <i>Romer v. Evans</i>, a powerful
new instrument.  That decision provides now a &quot;clean&quot;
device for blocking from the academy, and the professions, people
who are &quot;overly religious,&quot; overly serious about their
Christianity or Judaism, which is to say, people who take seriously
the traditional moral teachings of Christianity and Judaism.

<p>

The uses of this decision are portentous in their possibilities
-- which is why it is so critical that Congress takes the first
step in forcing the question.  For in acting, the Congress sharpens
the question for the Clinton administration.  Mr. Clinton has
already indicated that he will sign the Defense of Marriage Act
-- something, presumably, he would not do if he thought there
was anything unconstitutional in this measure.  But at the same
time, his spokesman has announced that the administration welcomed
the decision in <i>Romer v. Evans</i> as quite appropriate or justified.

<p>

In that event, the administration will be pressed to settle
the jural mind of Mr. Clinton:  Would the administration agree
with Prof. Eskridge and the people who would extract the broader
principle from <i>Romer</i> and use it to challenge the constitutionality
of the Defense of Marriage Act?  If so, then presumably President
Clinton would veto this act as unconstitutional.  But if the President
is still inclined to sign the act, if he is inclined then to defend
its constitutionality, then his administration would be obliged
to show just where the gay activists are wrong.  They could help
to establish then just how the decision in <i>Romer</i> could be narrowed
and limited.  If the administration could do that, it would be
rendering, almost in spite of itself, a public service.  And if
the Congress induced the administration to perform that service,
then this Defense of Marriage Act will produce a good that moves
well beyond the question of marriage in the laws.

<p>

But I would return, in closing, to the problem I mentioned at the 
beginning of these remarks, the problem posed by Congressman Frank. I 
said that the sky would not fall in, there may be no signs of deterioriation
in the neighborhood, as a consequence of recognizing a gay marriage,
but that kind of evidence was rather beside the point.  We were
dealing here with certain questions of principle, and with harms
that may not be measured with immediate, material injuries.  Those
questions involved the grounds of principle that underly the laws
on marriage, and the ground on which we favor that structure of
commitment and lawfulness as the framework for begetting and nurturing
children.  Some of us drew attention to the problem of polygamy
as a place where those questions of principle may be sharply focussed.
But it also suggests the kinds of changes that may make a profound
difference for the character and fabric of our lives if the laws
of marriage begin to come apart.  During the hearings, Congressman
Frank's inclination was to treat these arguments with derision
and scoffing.  He was not aware of any national movement pressing
for the return of polygamy.  Mr. Ed Fallon, a legislator from
Iowa, had testified at the hearings in favor of gay marriage,
and when the problem of polygamy was posed to him by Congressman
Sensenbrenner, he remarked that polygamy simply &quot;wasn't a
big issue&quot; in his State.

<p>

But as I said, we had been raising
questions of principle, not making predictions about a new trend
toward polygamy.  Yet, the people who were inclined to dismiss
the matter so lightly were treating, with a certain nonchalance,
something that deserved to be treated with far more caution and
sobriety.  For as it happens, polygamy has persisted, in isolated
pockets in our own country, even in our own day.  For many years,
there have been centers of polygamy in southern Utah and northern
Arizona, which have proven intractable.  There were outbreaks
of violence in the late 70s, throughout the 80s, and on into the
90s, as the authorities carried out raids in an effort to repress
the practice.  Mr. Ed Fallon remarked, with offhandedness, that
polygamy just doesn't happen to be a big issue back in Iowa.
But it seems to have eluded this earnest man that polygamy doesn't
happen to be an issue in his State precisely because the law,
for many years, has cast up serious barriers to polygamy.  The
federal government once had to send troops into Utah as part of
the scheme to repress the practice.  If those barriers started
coming down, do we really think that our species is incapable
of manifesting an interest in that arrangement once again?

<p>

When the proponents of gay marriage show a flippant disregard then
for polygamy, they show not only a want of historical memory,
but a dimness of moral imagination. It does not apparently enter
their reckoning of the world that political movements are often
stirred on and channeled by &quot;principles.&quot;

<p>

Nor do they readily see that the argument for gay marriage would sweep 
away the impediments of the law that impede, among other things, the
interest in polygamy.  These innocent people, who casually dismiss
these prospects out of hand, are part of that tribe described
by Aristotle in the <i>Ethics</i>: Their defect of understanding &quot;is
not due to a lack of years but living the kind of life which is
a succession of unrelated emotional experiences.&quot;  As the
principles they are planting now work themselves out, and the
results kick in, these people, in their childish candor, will
be the first to record their surprise.  And to tell us, earnestly,
that they never expected things to go this far.

<title>THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT: A SOCIAL WORKER'S VIEW</title>

<h2>THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT:<br>
A SOCIAL WORKER'S VIEW</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Brenda Destro, D.S.W.</center>

<p>

This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act.  The briefing was sponsored
by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

Good morning.  Today, I would like to discuss the following points:

<p><ul>

<li>Those who advance an agenda of homosexual rights and same-sex
relationships have shown little regard for the developmental needs
of preteens and teens.

<p>

<li>It is most evident in the design of sex education curricula
offered to 10- to 18-year-olds in most public schools throughout
our country.

<p>

<li>The subject of homosexuality, along with other topics, is
included in most sex education curricula more as the &quot;politically
correct&quot; thing to do, and not balanced with the cognitive,
emotional, social, and moral, needs of the children who participate
with harmful results.

<p>

<li>As homosexuality and same-sex relationships are further sanctioned,
then these topics will be given even greater recognition and a
higher profile in sex ed curricula.  This will result in more
harm, unless more recognition is given to teenage developmental
issues.

</ul><p>

Sex education contains many delicate and controversial topics,
such as homosexuality and same-sex relationships, which are not
presented with a lot of consideration to the developmental needs
of preteens/teens.  This puts these children at risk of problems
ranging from developmental delay to more serious emotional problems
or even physical harm.

<p>

Developmental theorists, such as Piaget, Erikson, Kohlberg, and
even Freud believe that there are distinct differences in personality,
in thinking, in socialization, and in morality among children
and adults of different ages.  The pattern by which each of us
goes through these stages is an individual, interrelated, and
interdependent process.  For the most part, each of us acquires
skills in a sequential manner.  Moving into one stage requires
the completion of the previous stage.  And, the absence of certain
skills, makes the learning of new 
behaviors much harder.  Most school curricula is designed around
the theories of Piaget, and to a lesser degree Erikson and Kohlberg.

<p>

Before I discuss the issue of homosexuality, let me give another
example of a less controversial topic in sex ed that is usually
presented in a manner that is not consistent with cognitive development
or the learning capabilities of preteens and teens:  decision-making.
Many sex ed curricula teach decision-making to children, ages
10-18, so that they make appropriate choices regarding their sexual
behavior.  They learn a model that helps them identify a problem,
develop options, assess options, and then make a decision.  Although
my first reaction, along with many parents, was that this is a
good thing for preteens and teens to learn, there is a problem.
Many preteens and teens are not able to think ahead, assess risk,
or fully consider the feelings of others.  Instead, they are more
likely to be self-centered, idealistic, present-oriented, and
impulsive.  The result is that these kids may be able to memorize
or learn the elements of a d-m model, but they are not likely
to use it.

<p>

But the problem is more serious than a teen or preteen not using
a d-m model.  It is a problem of expecting preteens and teens
to act like adults, when they should be acting like teens.  As
much as none of us like it, teens are supposed to be self-centered,
idealistic, and grounded in the present.  These characteristics
provide protection for the teen who is in the process of experimenting
with new ideas and behaviors.  Ultimately, they make mistakes,
but hopefully they learn from these mistakes.  It is much easier
to brush off mistakes when you are self-centered, present-oriented,
and oblivious to consequences.  The role of parents and adults
is to provide a structure that allows the teen to experiment consistent
with their capabilites, and then to be available to help them
learn from the experience.  What is taught in sex ed asks a child
to skip an important stage and try to make critical decisions
without the skills and guidance needed.  This expectation can
and does lure preteens and teens into high risk situation that
are beyond their current capabilities, placing them at risk of
an unwanted pregnancy or even AIDS.  What is needed is for the
child to experiment on a more gradual basis that does not overwhelm
them.  They should experiment, first, with safer tasks and gradually
learn to handle more risk, and always with the guidance of a parent
or other caring adult.

<p>

In the case of learning about homosexuality and same-sex relationships,
the potential for harm also exists.  These are topics that are
now commonly found in sex ed curricula offered through most junior
high and high schools as a result of the growing debate about
homosexuality.  But, as it's being taught, many of these teens
and preteens are entering a phase in their psychosocial development
where it is characteristic for a girls to have one close girlfriend
and boys to have one close boyfriend.  This is an important phase
in learning emotional intimacy that is critical to forming healthy
relationships.  Yet, there is no distinction made between the
two events in the sex ed curricula.

<p>

All of us, as children first learn emotional intimacy or closeness
in the family as we bond with mother, father, siblings, etc. 
As we reach puberty, we begin to reach outside the family to form
similar bonds with friends of the same sex, and then with groups
of friends of both sexes.  A healthy level of intimacy beomes
an important element of romantic relationships and sexual relationships
in marriage.  This process for the most part occurs in a sequential
fashion.  At each stage the child learns a new level of emotional
intimacy or closeness, if the child has acquired the necessary
skills in a non-threatening and non-sexual environment.  If they
skip a stage or experience a crisis in a stage, the negative aspects
of the stage will predominate making it difficult to handle the
tasks of the next stage.  One way to alleviate the problems is
to go back to that stage and complete the tasks.

<p>

So what happens to the preteens and teens who receive information
about homosexuality and same sex marriages at the same time that
they are bonding with their friends, around the ages of 11 to
14.  Probably for most preteens and teens, they is no harm because
of the support they have from family and friends who can help
them distinguish between the two events.  But for many children
with family or personal problems and no one to turn to for help,
there may be confusion.  That confusion can turn to a fear that
they may be homosexual, when they are not.  They may then turn
away from their friends and interrupt an important developmental
process.  In some cases, because of the confusion about this topic,
well-meaning but misguided counselors would even have these children
believe that they are homosexual, when they are not even sexually
mature.

<p>

As the debate continues and homosexuality and same-sex marriages
gain legitimacy, I foresee these topics gaining greater visibility
in sex ed curricula.  If it is not presented in the best interests
of children, but rather in the best interest of the homosexual
rights movement, there is potential for more harm.

<p>

Thank you.

<title>THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON EDUCATION OF HOMOSEXUAL 'MARRIAGE'</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON<br>
EDUCATION CURRICULA AND<br>
POLICY OF HOMOSEXUAL<br>
'MARRIAGE'</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Linda Page</center>

<p>

This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act.  The briefing was sponsored
by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

The legal recognition of same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; has the
potential to wreak havoc on an already failing public education
system.  Without a doubt, it can fundamentally affect every aspect
of schooling for children.  It will only further erode the moral
base on which our society depends and which our young people so
desperately need.  How ironic that teachers are prohibited by
law from sharing their Christian faith, or school from even posting
a copy of the Ten Commandments at the same time that homosexuals
are radically attacking our bedrock institutions.  What message
are we giving to highly impressionable students regarding our
society's most crucial values?

<p>

Doesn't it signify that legally equating same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;
with our most important social institution is in direct contradiction
to the most deeply held beliefs and values of the overwhelming
majority of Americans?  When was democracy also redefined to mean
that the beliefs and standards of the majority must succumb to
the whims of a special interest group -- even when those whims
are devastatingly destructive to the common good?

<p>

I've been a classroom teacher, reading specialist, an early childhood
education coordinator, and principal in the public schools.  I've
taught first-graders as well as older students.  I've worked the
suburbs and in the inner cities.  I've seen countless programs
implemented throughout the years based on whatever the policymakers
decided schools should teach or on the latest government- or 
university-sponsored ideas. Whatever the latest education craze 
happened to be, educators have been pressured to jump on the bandwagon.

<p>

Phonics was displaced by whole language. &quot;Modern math&quot;
replaced an emphasis on mastery of computation and problem solving
skills.  Explicit sexual training replaced &quot;family life 
education.&quot;  Consider the recent
classic example of William Spady's Outcome Based Education developed
as Far West Regional Lab.  Hundreds of millions of dollars have
been spent using our children as guinea pigs and our classrooms
as labs for unproved educational notions.  Programs which are
in direct contradictions to the values of mainstream America have
been created using taxpayers' money and implemented wholesale
in the schools time and time again.

<p>

As we have progressively made our schools <I><B>less</B></I> about
academics -- only 41 percent of the time secondary students spend
in schools is on academic subjects -- we have virtually expunged
traditional core values from our curricula and textbooks.  The
most far-reaching and damaging method for accomplishing this ignominious
feat has been through the implementation of values clarifications
programs.  According to William Kilpatrick, &quot;For students
it has meant learning to question values they have scarcely acquired,
unlearning values taught at home, and concluding that questions
of right and wrong are always merely subjective.&quot;

<p>

Theodore Roosevelt once said, &quot;To educate a person in mind
and not in morals is to educate a menace to society.&quot;  When
combined whit the unrestrained pursuit of self-interest, the values
clarification approach, also known as the decision-making model,
is reaping results of violence, mayhem, and devastating of the
worst kind among our students.  Why would we even consider further
denigration of values which have stood the test of time and opt
instead for the ill-conceived supposition that all values are
equal?

<p>

<center><h3>POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON SCHOOL CURRICULA AND EDUCATION 
POLICY</h3></center>

<p>

Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; recognized by law has the mind's
numbing potential to bring with it untold quantities of new and
ravaging educational mandates.  It is possible that classroom
teachers all over the country will be required to implement any
or all of a range of potential changes in our schools.  They might
include:

<ul><p>

<li>Providing new and more intensified self-esteem programs, with
a special homosexual emphasis.  Project 10 was founded by Dr.
Virginia Uribe in 1984 in LAUSD as the first openly homosexual
counseling program.  It also includes sensitivity training for
faculty and tactics to prevent &quot;homophobia&quot; within the
classroom.

<p>

<li>Teaching students that homosexuality is a positive choice.
Three key strategies in Project 10 materials &quot;for managing
heterosexism and homophobia in schooling&quot; are:  1) Include
lesbian and gay issues in curriculum; 2) Include readings which
address homosexual issues on required reading lists; and 3) Encourage
students to write about and discuss &quot;the ways in which homophobia
has impacted their lives.&quot; (Project 10 Handbook)

<p>

<li>An increased emphasis on teaching critical thinking skills
based on students' <I><B>feelings</B></I> about issues instead
of the facts.

<p>

<li>Orwellian &quot;doublespeak&quot; of many new vocabulary words
to accompany the new definition of family.

<p>

<li>Using newly-revised tests and textbooks which are politically-correct.
A 15-page segment in the 443-page <I>Children of the Rainbow</I>
curriculum titled, &quot;Fostering Positive Attitudes Toward Sexuality&quot;
was authored by lesbian Elissa Weindling at the request of the
Gay and Lesbian Teacher's Association.  As a lesbian herself,
she states that, &quot;Teachers of first-graders will have an
opportunity to give children a healthy sense of identity at an
early age.  Classes should include references to lesbian/gay people
in all curricular areas. . . .&quot;

<p>

<li>Teaching &quot;tolerance&quot; of homosexuality in the context
of school to work preparedness.

<p>

<li>Teaching state and national standards which support the value
of homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; while undermining traditional
values.

<p>

<li>Stronger moral relativism in all school programs.

<p>

<li>Teaching increasingly liberal, permissive sex education.

<p>

<li>Supporting students in the scorn of virtue and self-restraint
while promoting increased narcissism and self-gratification.

<p>

<li>Teaching the complete redefinition of the family in every
grade level and in every curricular area, beginning with kindergarten
and preschool students (since their social studies curriculum
is about the family).

<p>

<li>Teaching literature to which parents object.  (Selections
which could be included and required with the societal sanction
of same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; and the lifestyle which spawned
it should cause every parent to be alarmed.)

<p>

<li>Using more of the already-diminished academic time on social
engineering.

<p>

<li>Teaching new revisions in history which could encompass a
scope far more vast and revisionist than those in the original
proposed national history standards.

<p>

<li>Supporting the politically-correct reinvention of society
even while &quot;research has documented that children without
fathers more often have lower academic performance, more cognitive
and intellectual deficits, increased adjustment problems, and
higher risks for psychosexual development problems.&quot; (George
Rekers)

<p>

<li>Teaching students that whatever they <I><B>think</B></I> is
right or <I><B>feel</B></I> is right <I><B>is</B></I> right, instead
of teaching students genuine critical thinking which necessitates
learning to discern and express what is true -- to submit to truth
and to a set of absolutes.

<p>

<li>Teaching students circular reasoning where they start with
the desired premise and make statements to support it which &quot;prove&quot;
the issue as fact.

<p>

<li>Teaching segments of the <I>Children of the Rainbow</I> curriculum
which promote homosexuality beginning at the earliest levels of
schooling.  (The implementation of this &quot;experiment&quot;
caused a furor in New York City not many years ago with its use
of primary-level reading books such as <I>Heather Has Two Mommies</I>
and <I>Daddy's Roommate</I> which states that &quot;gay is just
another kind of love.&quot;  These books blatantly and frankly
promote same-sex parenting.)  What will happen to educators who
refuse to teach the new curricula endorsing same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;?

<p>

<li>Teaching major revisions in curricula for literature, reading,
health, sex education. P.E. and drama.

<p>

<li>Supporting extracurricular activities which accommodate gay
and lesbian dating. In May 1994, LAUSD authorized the first gay and 
lesbian prom in the country. (Michael Quintinella)

<p>

<li>Further undermining of parental values and beliefs with more
intensive erosion of the traditional rights of parents.  Same
sex marriage with the force of law will take the rights of parents
away to decide what their children are taught about homosexuality.

<p>

<li>Diluting character education programs to accommodate the new
value system.

<p>

<li>Implementing new state and national standards which present
homosexual marriage as equal to traditional family values.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

At precisely the time when schools and society are recognizing
the serious need for character education -- for personal responsibility,
self-discipline and other core virtues -- the most important social
institution on our society is receiving the most serious threat
it has faced in recorded history.

<p>

When doing what <I>feels</I> good matters more than doing what
is right, character education based on absolutes and traditional
moral standards will become a complete misnomer.  Self-control
and responsibility for the greater good will be a contradiction
to the same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; value system.  Since absolutes
of right and wrong will be negated, cheating in schools and students
stealing from each other will also have to be &quot;tolerated,&quot;
among other &quot;values.&quot;

<p>

As Thomas Sowell has stated so well, &quot;To teach issues instead
of intellectual principles to school children is like teaching
calculus to people who have not yet learned arithmetic, or surgery
to people lacking the rudiments of anatomy or hygiene.  Worse,
it is teaching them to go ahead and perform surgery, without worrying
about boring details.&quot;

<p>

Our schools reverberate with violence, declining achievement,
and disrespect for authority.  Legalization of same sex marriage
will only further erode the morel underpinnings and the culture
of the family which has been a primary source of strength throughout
the history of this country and of western civilization.

<p>

At one time in the history of our country, education was virtually
synonymous with moral training.  The traditional virtues and cultural
mores were passed down from generation to generation because they
work.

<p>

Our students have been guinea pigs in Russian roulette with their
futures long enough.  Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; is a result
of a destructive, narcissistic way of thinking and of 
&quot;value-neutral&quot; curriculums.  One can only shudder to 
consider the horrific possibilities which may occur on the sexuality 
continuum with the perpetuation of such policies.

<p>

Instead of &quot;tolerance and diversity&quot; training for teachers,
we need to implement training programs where educators learn the
noble facts about our country's history and how to teach them
to our students.  They need to become well-versed in the legal
parameters for teaching about religion and the values and virtues
which strengthen our society.

<p>

Amitai Etzioni in <I>The Spirit of Community</I> states, &quot;To
shore up the moral foundations of our society, we start with the
family.  Second in line are the schools.  They are more than places
in which people acquire skills and knowledge....Education includes
the reinforcement of values gained at home and the introduction
of values to those children whose parents neglected their character
formation and moral upbringing.  Third are the social webs that
communities provide in neighborhoods, at work, and in ethnic clubs
and associations....Fourth, the national society must ensure that
local communities will not lock in values that we ars a more encompassing
and overriding community, abhor...&quot;

<p>

He states further, &quot;In the 50s we had a well-established
society, but it was unfair to women and minorities and a bit authoritarian.
In the 60s we undermined the established society and its values.
In the 80s we were told that the unbridled pursuit of self-interest
was virtuous.  By the 90s we have seen the cumulative results.&quot;

<p>

Where do we go from here?  The destruction of one of our most
vital institutions is threatened.  We must protect our children
now.

<title>DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT: HOW ADOPTION POLICY IS AFFECTED</title>

<h2>DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT:<br>
HOW ADOPTION POLICY IS<br>
AFFECTED</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Mary Beth Style, M.S.W.</i></center>

<p>

<i>This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act.  The briefing was sponsored
by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

Whenever there is a discussion of adoption it is generally useful
to remind the audience of the purpose of adoption.  In the United
States, adoption has traditionally been an institution to create
families for children when their biological families could not
or would not raise them.  The law has been very careful to ensure
that adoptive families are treated the same, for all intents and
purposes, as families who gave birth to their children.  In addition,
the law also requires that the child be at the center of all adoption
policy and practice.  Unfortunately, in recent years, some who
have attempted to reform adoption laws and policies are not addressing
the needs of children, but instead are promoting the cause of
adults.  Discussions about &quot;right to adopt&quot; are clearly
not child-centered, but adult-driven.

<p>

Adoption law varies substantially from state to state in matters
relative to time frames for taking consents or overturning adoption
decrees.  But the states are unanimous on one point:  an adoption
cannot be granted  by a judge unless it is proven to be in the
best interest of the child.  While there may be a difference of
opinion about what is in the best interest of a particular child,
the law is clear that it is the child that matters, not the adults.

<p>

Except for a very few exceptions, adoption law and policy has
attempted to stay away from categorizing who can and cannot adopt.
The exceptions generally would be limited to prohibiting persons
with a history of abuse or crime from adopting.  In addition,
Florida and New Hampshire prohibited by statute homosexuals from
adopting.  In virtually every other state, until recently, the
law has allowed only married couples or a single individual to
adopt.  The reason  for this policy, which I believe is sound,
is that the state believed that adults should make a legal commitment
to each other before making the commitment to a child to ensure stability
for the child.  A true family, which adoption is intended to create,
cannot exist if the only legal relationship between the parties
exists through the child only.

<p>

While it is true that this policy has prevented two homosexuals
from adopting a child, it also has prevented unmarried heterosexuals.
There have been exceptions to the rule as individual courts have
allowed adoptions by unrelated adults to proceed.  One of the
more celebrated cases is the Woody Allen/Mia Farrow adoptions.
Obviously, if states begin to recognize marriage between homosexuals,
it will likely become easier for two homosexuals to adopt a child
because they will be meeting the marriage requirement.

<p>

However, while it is true that a judge must give final approval
to an adoption once he or she determines it to be in the best
interest of the child, the real decision making generally occurs
at an earlier point by the individual or agency making the placement.
While few of us would want social service agencies to arbitrarily
prevent appropriate people from being able to adopt, I do believe
that we must be very careful about suggesting that any individuals
or groups should have the right to adopt.

<p>

There is no &quot;right&quot; to adopt and to create one would
be contrary to the best interests of children because instead
of finding the most appropriate family for a child, the state
and its agents would have to ensure that adults are allowed to
adopt a child.  Since a &quot;right&quot; is a guarantee, the
state would be required to &quot;guarantee&quot; a child for adoption.
The absurdity of that position is obvious.  Yet, I am troubled
by discussions in recent years by some who are promoting &quot;gay
rights&quot; who are proposing that there ought to be a right
to adopt.

<p>

Instead, decisions about children should be made based on an individual
child's needs, taking into account any existing relationships
the child may have.  We have a growing body of evidence which
shows the damage done to children who are raised without fathers.
Much of that research emphasizes the differences in parenting
styles between mothers and fathers and shows that each is important
for the healthy development of children.  It is clear that it
is not an issue of quantity when it comes to parenting.  A child
who is raised by his mother and grandmother, may have tow parents
for all intents and purposes to share the load, but the absence
of a father is still very apparent in his development.

<p>

There is no denying that many children raised by single parents
and children raise by homosexuals are doing very well.  But the
child who is raised by a mother and a father has an easier time
of it and has the opportunity to experience and model the behaviors
of both sexes.

<p>

In adoption, it has traditionally been the responsibility of the
field and the state to stack the deck in favor of the child. 
Many policies appear to be unfair to adults, but again adoption
is not about  adults.  For example, many individuals balk at the
notion that adopting parents should be in good health arguing
that many individuals who give birth have chronic health conditions
or that none of us knows when we might be hit by a car.

<p>

While both of those arguments are valid, it is the obligation
of the social worker or agency to weigh the odds in favor of the
child.  It is more likely that healthy parents will be around
to see a child grow to maturity than a parent with a serious medical
condition.  So, too, policies which give preference to married
heterosexuals stack the deck in favor of the child.  While it
may be true that in certain cases, where an individual has a relationship
with a particular child or has a special gift to match the special
needs of a particular child, it is in the best interest of a child
to be adopted by a single person, whether heterosexual or homosexual.

<p>

But, if we truly are looking at the best interest of the and not
concerned about the appearance of being tolerant of adults, we
will select whenever possible, a mother and a father for child.
Kids do not care about being politically correct.  They just
want a mommy and a daddy.

<title>'HOMOSEXUAL CORRECTNESS' ADVANCES IN AMERICA'S SCHOOLS</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>'HOMOSEXUAL CORRECTNESS'<br>
ADVANCES IN AMERICA'S SCHOOLS</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Peter LaBarbera</center>

<p>

This presentation was given at a July 2, 1996 briefing on Capitol
Hill regarding the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  The briefing
was sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p><br>

<center>&quot;Marriages between homosexuals should be recognized....<br>
We must accept a homosexual orientation in young people in the same<br>
manner we accept a heterosexual orientation....&quot;</center>

<p>

These are two recommendations by gay activist Paul Gibson in his
paper, &quot;Gay Male and Lesbian Youth Suicide,&quot; which is
being used to promote &quot;gay friendly&quot; policies in schools
nationwide.  Recent months and years have witnessed the beginnings
of an unprecedented campaign by homosexual activists to affirm
homosexuality and so-called &quot;gay youth&quot; in schools.
This effort, advanced on a hundred fronts from Utah to New Hampshire,
has made steady gains while the nation's attention is focused
on another radical homosexual goal: legalizing gay &quot;marriage.&quot;

<p>

The campaign to teach schoolchildren and teens that &quot;gay
is OK&quot; benefits from the usual coordination of a united &quot;gay&quot;
movement which has the advantage of pressing for a <I>single radical
goal</I>, versus its pro-family opponents who face a multiplicity
of challenges.  Parents who simply want a good education for their
children are increasingly confronted with the prospect of seeing
precious educational resources spent on talking about homosexuality,
and they are drawn into time-consuming and divisive debates over
this issue.

<p>

Of course, the questions of homosexuality instruction in schools
and &quot;gay marriage&quot; are linked, as homosexual activists
and their educational allies argue that students need to be presented
with &quot;positive&quot; images of &quot;gay role models&quot;
to counter the negative representations of &quot;homophobic&quot;
society.  What could be more positive than teaching children that
-- just like heterosexuals -- gays and lesbians get married and
raise children?

<p>

As surely as summer follows spring, legal homosexual &quot;marriage&quot;
would quickly be seized upon by pro-gay educators as the latest
teaching tool to inculcate the normalcy of homosexuality to young 
minds.  How young?  The publishers of the latest homosexual children's 
book, &quot;Daddy's Wedding&quot; tell us it is &quot;appropriate 
for children ages 2 to 6.&quot; The book uses colorful pictures to 
tell the story of a young boy, Nick, who is &quot;best man&quot; at 
the &quot;wedding&quot; ceremony between his &quot;gay&quot; daddy 
and his homosexual lover. One page shows the men kissing at the altar 
as young Nick looks on.  &quot;Daddy's Wedding&quot; is published by the 
same company that gave us &quot;Heather Has Two Mommies&quot; and 
&quot;Daddy's Roommate.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>THE &QUOT;GAY YOUTH&QUOT; CAMPAIGN AND &QUOT;SAFE 
SCHOOLS&QUOT;</h3></center>

<p>

Efforts to affirm so-called homosexual youth advance under the
rubric of promoting &quot;diversity&quot; and enhancing 
&quot;self-esteem&quot; -- two fads in today's faltering public 
schools.  The campaign rests on several tendentious suppositions 
that have barely begun to be fully debated by larger society, 
foremost among them is the myth that a certain percentage of kids 
have a &quot;gay&quot; (or <I>lesbian, bisexual or transgendered</I>) 
&quot;identity&quot; which they were likely born with, and which is 
unchangeable. Educators are tasked with affirming such children and 
helping them cope in the midst of a homophobic culture.

<p>

With this goal in mind of shoring up the &quot;gay minority&quot;
of students, gay activists have chosen a strategy of promoting,
not homosexuality, they say, but &quot;safe schools.&quot;  The
cunning strategy relies heavily on winning public sympathy for
&quot;gay youth&quot; as a besieged victim group in schools. 
It was  best outlined in a recent speech by Kevin Jennings, a
homosexual and former high school teacher who is now executive
director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Teachers Network (GLSTN),
a 3,000-member organization crusading against &quot;homophobia&quot;
in schools.  Listen to Jennings describe how the &quot;safe schools&quot;
approach helped cripple the pro-family opposition and win passage
in Massachusetts of a 1994 law -- the first of its kind in the
nation -- banning &quot;discrimination&quot; in public schools
based on &quot;sexual orientation:&quot;

<p><blockquote>

<i>We immediately seized upon the opponents' calling card -- safety
-- and explained how homophobia represents a threat to students'
safely by creating a climate where violence, name-calling, health
problems, and suicide are common....We knew that, confronted with
real-life stories of youth who had suffered from homophobia, our
opponents would automatically be on the defensive:  they would
have to attack people who had already been victimized once, which
put them in a bully position from which it would be hard to emerge
looking good.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Keeping the above victim imagery in mind, it is easy to envision
pro-gay educators teaching their youthful subjects that the inability
of homosexuals to get married is just one more in a litany of
&quot;civil rights&quot; denied to homosexuals.  Hopefully this
will not be offered as part of a history course in the near or
distant future.

<p>

<center><h3>THE SUICIDE SCAM</h3></center>

<p>

Homosexual activists have shamelessly exploited the issue of &quot;gay
youth&quot; suicide to promote pro-homosexuality programs in schools,
hyping a non-existent &quot;epidemic&quot; to silence their critics
and frame the debate before an emotionally sympathetic public.
As Jennings said, &quot;In Massachusetts, no one could speak
up against our frame and say, 'Why yes, I do think students should
kill themselves.'  This allowed us to set the terms of the debate.&quot;

<p>

There are two major problems with Jennings' assertion.  Firstly,
his claim of a rash of &quot;gay youth&quot; suicides is baseless,
and relies mainly on a thoroughly discredited paper by a homosexual
activist.  Secondly, even it were true that self-perceived 'homosexuals'
are prone to commit suicide in higher numbers than other youth,
it does not mean that schools should be <I>confirming</I> young
teens in an immoral and dangerous lifestyle.  In fact, disproportionate
rates of (adult) suicide in even the most &quot;gay-friendly&quot;
areas like San Francisco indicate that this is yet another sad
fact of homosexual life, not the fault of society.  As Alan Medenger,
a former homosexual, says, &quot;It is tragic, even criminal,
to lead a child into homosexuality because he or she showed some
degree of sexual confusion in adolescence.&quot;

<p>

And yet confirming &quot;gay youth&quot; in their homosexuality
is precisely the goal of GLSTN and countless other homosexual
organizations who routinely repeat the claim that homosexual youth
make up one-third of all youth suicides.  The figure has its origins
in a paper San Francisco gay activist Paul Gibson wrote that was
part of an Health and Human Services report on youth suicide.
Gibson's report, which was repudiated by HHS Secretary Louis
Sullivan, made the claim that &quot;gay youth&quot; made up &quot;30
percent&quot; of all youth suicides by extrapolating from another
bogus &quot;gay&quot; number -- that homosexuals represent 10
percent of the population.  David Shaffer, a Columbia University
psychiatrist and one of the world's leading specialists on adolescent
suicide, said, &quot;I struggled for a long time over [Gibson's]
mathematics, but in the end it seemed more hocus-pocus than math.&quot;
Shaffer also wrote that Gibson's and others' claims that gay
suicide is common is &quot;an excellent example of how bad research
provides misleading answers that can come home to roost.&quot;

<p>

To illustrate the tendentious nature of Paul Gibson's &quot;research,&quot;
it is useful to examine some of his other claims and recommendations
found in the paper he submitted to HHS and later repudiated by
Secretary Sullivan:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;A substantial number of youth -- perhaps one in 10 --
have a primary gay male, lesbian or bisexual orientation....&quot;

<p>

&quot;Transsexual youth who are open about their identity face
extreme abuse and rejection from their families....The only known
course of treatment is to help transsexuals adjust to their believed
gender identity and obtain sex-assignment surgery.  Most transsexual
youth, however, are unable to obtain or afford the help they need
in resolving their identity conflicts...&quot;

<p>

&quot;Homosexuality...is a natural and healthy expression of
human sexuality...All youth need to be presented with positive
information about homosexuality that presents it as a viable adaptation....It
is important for schools to hire openly gay male and lesbian teachers
to serve as role models and resource people for gay youth.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Religions need to reassess homosexuality in a positive
context within their belief systems....Religions should also take
responsibility for providing their families and membership with
positive information about homosexuality that discourages the
oppression of lesbians and gay men.  Faiths that condemn homosexuality
should recognize how they contribute to the rejection of gay youth
by their families and suicide among lesbians and gay male youth.&quot;</i>

</blockquote><p>

So, the next time you hear a homosexual activist claim that a
&quot;government study&quot; found that 30 percent of all youth
suicides are committed by homosexuals, remember that the same
gay activist who produced that &quot;study&quot; also calls for
reaching out to &quot;transsexual youth&quot; and says religions
need to shed their homophobia.

<p>

<center><h3>OTHER PRO-GAY PROGRAMS IN SCHOOLS</h3></center>

<p>

Beyond hyping suicide as a justification for homosexual-affirming
policies in schools, gay educators and their allies are promoting
a variety of other strategies to accomplish their goal of normalizing
homosexuality, among them:

<p><ul>

<li>Promoting the celebration of &quot;Gay History Month&quot;
in schools to provide students with positive homosexual role models.
In these programs, notables like First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt
are often portrayed factually as &quot;gay&quot; without giving
contradictory historical evidence.  Even if such figures did have
homosexual tendencies, many question why this aspect of their
lives should be stressed in history lessons.  Brilliance is, sadly,
often accompanied by destructive behavior.  Certainly quite an
impressive list of historical notables could be compiled if it
were to be decided that schools should celebrate &quot;Alcoholic
History Month&quot; or &quot;Adulterers History Month.&quot;

<p>

<li>Creating &quot;gay-straight&quot; youth alliances in high
schools, which frequently become conduits for pro-homosexual propagandizing
to student bodies. In the conservative town of Dedham, Massachusetts,
this was done with taxpayer monies as parents were stunned to
learn that a &quot;gay-straight&quot; alliance (which they didn't
even know existed) had received $2,000 in state funds to distribute
a questionnaire on &quot;gay&quot; issues to all homerooms at
the local high school.  One of the survey's questions was, &quot;Do
you feel lesbian or gay people should be allowed to marry?&quot;
It goes without saying that &quot;gay-straight&quot; youth groups
play perfectly to a youngster's tendency to adopt political positions
contrary to those of his or her parents.  Hence rallying behind
the &quot;civil rights&quot; of fellow &quot;gay&quot; students
wins ample student support and will be fully exploited by adult
homosexual activist groups like GLSTN.

<p>

<li>Affirming the right of openly homosexual teachers to proudly
affirm their gay &quot;identity&quot; to schoolchildren.  One
lesbian teacher recently made headlines by using a pink triangle
to inform students that her class was a &quot;safe zone&quot;
for &quot;gays.&quot;  Parents were not informed of the decision.
GLSTN held five regional conferences for homosexual teachers
during the 1996-96 school year. At one such conference in Los
Angeles, lesbian activist Donna Redwing declared, &quot;We're
here, we're queer, we're in the classroom.&quot;  The assembled
GLSTN-affiliated teachers cheered Redwing's declaration.  Hence
GLSTN conferences serve to radicalize homosexual teachers, making
them more likely to openly promote homosexuality as something
positive (or at least benign or neutral) to their students when
they return to their classrooms.

<p>

<li>Address the issue of how to combat &quot;homophobic&quot;
attitudes in young schoolchildren (kindergarten through sixth-grade).
The homosexual activist group GLAAD (Gay and Lesbian Alliance
Against Defamation) recently called on the FCC to demand that
children's television (&quot;Ernie and Bert,&quot; etc.) be used
to teach children about the &quot;horrors of homophobia.&quot;

</ul><p>

Homosexual activists are deadly serious about using the education
process to teach kids that homosexuality is okay, and that anyone
who thinks otherwise is a &quot;bigot.&quot;  If parents are not
vigilant in ferreting out such propaganda and countering it, they
will witness the rise of a generation hostile to five millennia
of Judeo-Christian teaching proscribing homosexual behavior.

<title>THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT: EXPERT TESTIMONY</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>THE DEFENSE OF<br>
MARRIAGE ACT:<br>
EXPERT TESTIMONY</h2></center>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>The following are excerpts from a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill
briefing regarding the Defense of Marriage Act.  The briefing
was sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

<center><h3>RESEARCH</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Two profoundly mistaken ideas have sunk deeply into public
sentiment where they exert a powerful influence in the shaping
of public policy as it relates to family, sexuality and marriage.
These are: 1) That homosexuality is genetic, and that consequently,
2) Homosexuality is unchangeable.  Neither idea is true, and in
fact there is a mountain of scientific evidence to the contrary.
The Americans being most severely harmed by the propagation of
these untruths are the very large number of homosexuals who wish
nothing more than to rid themselves of these unwanted impulses
and establish quiet marriages and families.  The gay and lesbian
activism that claims to speak for these many struggling fellow
citizens speaks for their interests in no way whatsoever.  Completely
ignored are the very large number of people who have already succeeded
in leaving homosexuality behind....Epidemiologists around the
country have confirmed that among young gay men there is a significant
return to the unsafest of sexual practices in spite of over fifteen
years of massively-funded education programs.  They have also
found that a shocking 30 percent of all currently 20-year-old
young men who identify themselves as 'gay' will be either HIV-positive
or dead of AIDS by the time they are 30. Yet, as is widely known
and confirmed by recent research, many of these young men will
spontaneously leave homosexuality behind....With respect to genetics,
even those recent studies widely touted as demonstrating the innate,
biological and genetically determined nature of homosexuality
demonstrate precisely the contrary, and a careful reading of the
authors themselves makes this clear.&quot; -- <I>Jeffrey B. Satinover,
M.D., psychiatrist, former Fellow in Psychiatry and Child Psychiatry
at Yale University, and author of</I> Homosexuality and the Politics
of Truth.

<p>

<center><h3>THE LAW AND MARRIAGE</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Every argument for gay marriage is an argument that would
support polygamy.  The gay activists may not have the remotest
interest in promoting polygamy, but this much may fairly be said: They 
have the most profound interest, rooted in the logic of their doctrine,
in discrediting the notion that marriage finds its defining ground
in 'nature.'  Their rhetorical strategy, their public arguments,
have all been directed explicitly to the derision of that claim
that sexuality in the strictest sense involves the sexuality 'imprinted
in our natures.'  For that reason, we can count on the fact that
there will be someone, somewhere, ready to press this issue by
raising a challenge in the court and testing the limits even further.
The irony then is that the notion of marriage cannot accommodate
couples of the same sex without so altering the cast or character
of marriage that it will cease to be that special relation, which
seems to be the object of such deep craving now for so many people.
Once the notion of marriage is broadened in that way, it will
simply not be tenable any longer to hold up marriage, in the laws,
as a relation that deserves a special place, a special commendation
-- a special effort to sustain and promote it.  This Act is the
most delicate and limited measure that the Congress could produce
on the subject.  It treats subjects that are evidently within
the reach of the Congress, and it makes the least intrusion into
the domain of State law.  What other institution could possibly
have the authority to clarify the meaning of terms in federal
legislation, if not the federal legislature?&quot; -- <I>Hadley
Arkes, Professor of Jurisprudence and American Institutions at
Amherst College.</I>

<p>

<center><h3>REAL RECOVERY</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;I speak to you today not just as an observer of this movement,
but as one of them.  I am a former homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle
from the time I was 17 until I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle
thinking that there really wasn't any choice for me.  What I didn't
realize is that although I didn't choose to be homosexual, I did
not have to be gay. I had a choice.  I could change my orientation
from gay to straight. My healing process was a long and difficult
one.  However, change is possible.  The four national ex-gay networks
are currently ministering to more than 10,000 former homosexuals.
Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle that initially seems
very freeing but eventually puts us in all kinds of bondage and
eventually will kill us. I have lost over 35 of my friends and
acquaintances to the disease of AIDS and don't want to see one
more person become infected with this deadly disease.  The organized
gay community is telling us that AIDS is no longer a gay disease
and, although it is spreading into the heterosexual population
in this country very quickly, 61 percent of people that are coming
down with this deadly disease in the U.S. are homosexual, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.  America must take
a very strong stand against the very highly organized gay community
in this country by supporting The Defense of Marriage Act.  If
we don't say 'no' to the organized gay community now, the United
States will suffer the consequences of our complacency.  America
needs to start helping homosexuals recover from their sexual brokenness.
Putting a stamp of approval on a lifestyle by legally recognizing
it (and even calling it marriage) is not really helping homosexuals.
It's perpetuating a myth and delivering them over to a death-style.&quot;
-- <I>Anthony Falzarano, former homosexual, executive director
of Transformation Ministries.</I>

<p>

<center><h3>THE GAY RIGHTS AGENDA</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Most Americans believe in the philosophy of 'live and let
live.'  They don't want to make the plight of homosexuals any
more difficult than it already is.  But tolerance is not what
homosexual activists are seeking.  They are demanding that society
elevate homosexuality to the moral level of marriage.  When they
bring the law into it, they are no longer just minding their own
business, but imposing it on every single citizen.  If you are
a devout Christian, Jew or Muslim, or merely someone who believes
homosexuality is immoral and harmful, and the law declares homosexuality
a protected status, then your personal beliefs are now outside
civil law.  This has very serious implications, for if the law
declares opposition to homosexuality as bigotry, then the entire
power of the civil rights apparatus can be brought against you.
Businessmen will have to subsidize homosexuality or face legal
sanctions; schoolchildren will have to be taught that homosexuality
is the equivalent of marital love; religious people will be told
their beliefs are no longer valid, and their independence will
be challenged....The Boy Scouts of America are under legal attack
in the states which have special rights for 'sexual orientation.'
The Scouts, a private group, are being told to abandon their
moral code of more than 80 years and to place young boys under
homosexual men on camping trips -- or face financial ruin.  The
attack against the Scouts is really an attack on parents, because
parents have the right, in a free nation, to entrust their children
to organizations that reflect the parents' most deeply held beliefs.
If they cannot do this, then we are living in tyranny.&quot;
-- <I>Robert H. Knight, director of cultural studies at the Family
Research Council.</I>

<p>

<center><h3>THE MYTH OF 'GAY TEEN SUICIDE'</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Homosexual activists have shamelessly exploited the issue
of 'gay youth' suicide to promote pro-homosexuality programs in
schools, hyping a non-existent 'epidemic' to silence their critics
and frame the debate before an emotionally sympathetic public.
As (homosexual and former high school teacher Kevin) Jennings
recently said, 'In Massachusetts, no one could speak up against
our frame and say, &quot;Why yes, I do think students should kill
themselves.&quot;  This allowed us to set the terms of the debate.'
(Editor's note:  Jennings is now executive director of the Gay,
Lesbian and Straight Teacher's Network, or GLSTN, a 3,000-member
organization crusading against &quot;homophophia&quot; in schools.)
There are two major problems with Jennings' assertion.  Firstly,
his claim of a rash of 'gay youth' suicides is baseless, and relies
mainly on a thoroughly discredited paper by a homosexual activist.
Secondly, even it were true that self-perceived 'homosexuals'
are prone to commit suicide in higher numbers than other youth,
it does not mean that schools should be <I>confirming</I> young
teens in an immoral and dangerous lifestyle.  In fact, disproportionate
rates of (adult) suicide in even the most 'gay-friendly' areas
like San Francisco indicate that this is yet another sad fact
of homosexual life, not the fault of society....And yet confirming
'gay youth' in their homosexuality is precisely the goal of GLSTN
and countless other homosexual organizations who routinely repeat
the claim that homosexual youth make up one-third of all youth
suicides.  The figure has its origins in a paper San Francisco
gay activist Paul Gibson wrote that was part of a Health and Human 
Services report on youth suicide.  Gibson's report, which was repudiated 
by HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan, made the claim that 'gay youth' made
up '30 percent' of all youth suicides by extrapolating from another
bogus 'gay' number -- that homosexuals represent 10 percent of
the population.  David Shaffer, a Columbia University psychiatrist
and one of the world's leading specialists on adolescent suicide,
said, 'I struggled for a long time over [Gibson's] mathematics,
but in the end it seemed more hocus-pocus than math.'  Shaffer
also wrote that Gibson's and others' claims that gay suicide is
common is 'an excellent example of how bad research provides misleading
answers that can come home to roost.'&quot; -- <I>Peter LaBarbera,
editor and founder of</I> The Lambda Report on Homosexuality.

<p>

<center><h3>THE EFFECTS ON SAME-SEX FRIENDSHIPS</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Many...(junior and high school) teens and preteens are entering
a phase in their psychosocial development where it is characteristic
for girls to have one close girlfriend and boys to have one close
boyfriend.  This is an important phase in learning emotional intimacy
that is crucial to forming healthy relationships....So what happens
to the preteens and teens who receive information about homosexuality
and same-sex 'marriages' at the same time that they are bonding
with their friends (around the ages of 11-14)...for many children
with family or personal problems and no one to turn to for help,
there may be confusion.  That confusion can turn to a fear that
they may be homosexual, when they are not.  They may then turn
away from their friends and interrupt an important developmental
process.  In some cases, because of the confusion about this topic,
well-meaning but misguided counselors would even have these children
believe that they are homosexual, when they are not even sexually
mature.&quot; -- <I>Brenda Destro, D.S.W., Adjunct Professor for
Studies on Marriage and Family at the John Paul II Institute and
former social work consultant for the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services Office of Adolescent Pregnancy and the Institute
for Human Resources (IHR).</I>

<p>

<center><h3>NO 'RIGHT' TO ADOPT</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Unfortunately, in recent years, some who have attempted
to reform adoption laws and policies are not addressing the needs
of children, but instead are promoting the cause of adults.  Discussions
about 'rights to adopt' are clearly not child-centered, but 
adult-driven....Obviously, if states begin to recognize marriage 
between homosexuals, it will likely become easier for two homosexuals to 
adopt a child because they will be meeting the marriage requirement....There
is no 'right' to adopt, and to create one would be contrary to
the best interests of children, because instead of finding the
most appropriate family for a child, the state and its agents
would have to ensure that adults are allowed to adopt a child.
Since a 'right' is a guarantee, the state would be required to
'guarantee' a child for adoption.  The absurdity of that position
is obvious.&quot; -- <I>Mary Beth Style, M.S.W., former vice president
for policy and practice of the National Council for Adoption.</I>

<p>

<center><h3>SEX EDUCATION</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Our students have been guinea pigs in Russian roulette with
their futures long enough....Our kids will be bombarded with the
propaganda from books such as <I>Heather Has Two Mommies</I>....Same-sex
marriage is a result of a destructive, narcissistic way of thinking
and of 'value-neutral' curriculums.  One can only shudder to consider
the horrific possibilities which may occur on the sexuality continuum
with the perpetuation of such policies....We have communicated
to students that all values are equal.  How ludicrous...&quot;
-- <I>Linda Page, former school principal, education consultant,
talk show host and writer.</I>

<title>THE CASE FOR LIFE</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>THE CASE FOR LIFE</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Gracie Hsu</center>

<p>

This speech was presented before the Washington Health Policy
Fellows Program of the American Medical Students Association on
June 20, 1996 in Washington, D.C.</i>

<p>

The first principle of the Hippocratic Oath is &quot;do no harm.&quot;
That pledge, which each of you will undoubtedly take before you
become full-fledged physicians, is grounded in the simple truth
that human life is valuable and precious at all stages of life
and that the high call of the physician is to help preserve, not
destroy, human life.  This could also be the motto of the pro-life
community, for it is that truth which motivates, indeed, compels
the pro-life community to do what we do.

<p>

And what is it that we do?  In the words of Proverbs 31, we &quot;speak
up for those who cannot speak for themselves.&quot;  On the individual
level, we help women who feel they have no other choice but to
abort their unborn children to choose a better, albeit not easy,
alternative.  We seek to minister to her emotional, spiritual,
physical, and financial needs because many women have expressed
the fact that they chose abortion because they lacked the resources
to meet these needs.  Indeed, the Alan Guttmacher Institute reports
that women usually choose abortion for three main reasons.  Three-fourths
of respondents say that having a baby would interfere with work,
school, or other responsibilities.  Two-thirds say say they cannot
afford to have a child.  Half of the respondents say they do not
want to be a single parent or that they have problems in their
relationship with their husband or partner.

<p>

Thus, the pro-life community strives to meet the needs of these
women through crisis pregnancy centers.  These centers help pregnant
women one woman at a time.  They find out her needs, and seek
to help her choose life for her unborn baby by aiding her either
through an adoption process or by providing the soon-to-be mother
with material goods such as maternity clothing and baby necessities.
Counselors provide emotional and often spiritual support and
are committed to helping that mother for as long as she needs.

<p>

On the policy level, we seek to influence members of Congress
to uphold laws that acknowledge the humanity of the unborn and
overturn those laws which do not respect the moral opposition that the 
public holds against abortion.  Banning partial-birth abortions and 
amending the abortion mandate for medical school accreditation are just
two examples of our efforts during this 104th Congress.  I will
address each of these initiatives in more detail later on in the
presentation.

<p>

For right now, though, the most important thing that I want to
communicate to you is why pro-lifers do what we do.  There are
three main reasons which can broadly be stated this way:  (1)
Abortion takes the lives of unborn children; (2) Abortion hurts
women; and (3) Abortion is detrimental to society.

<p>

I realize that those are broad generalizations, but I'd like to
delve into each aspect individually here, in more detail.  We'll
tackle the first aspect first:  Abortion takes the lives of unborn
children.  This is the most well-known of the three arguments.
I'm sure you're all familiar with the saying that &quot;abortion
stops a beating heart.&quot;  Well, it does.  With the development
of modern technology and advancements in the fields of embryology
and perinatology, the public is being made more aware that a fetus
is far from &quot;a blob of tissue,&quot; but rather an unborn
human being which bears great resemblance to, nothing less than,
a baby.  Although this should not be news to you as medical students,
for many, the perception that abortion only removes a &quot;blob
of tissue&quot; persists.  At least one feminist has said that
the reason pro-choicers cling to that belief is because it makes
abortion more comfortable, more justifiable, if it can be grounded
in the denial that the fetus is really a baby.

<p>

Regardless of what people choose to think, though, abortion does
indeed take the lives of unborn children.  It was a realization
like this one, in fact, which gave Norma McCorvey, the &quot;Roe&quot;
of <I>Roe v. Wade</I>, pause to begin reconsidering her position
on abortion.  As Ms. McCorvey tells it, she looked at a whole
row of empty park swings one day and asked herself, &quot;Where
are all the children?&quot;  She suddenly thought, &quot;Oh no!
They've all been aborted!&quot;  This was the beginning of Ms.
McCorvey's journey towards a pro-life perspective.  Today, Ms.
McCorvey has not only disavowed her pro-choice stance, but she
has also become 100 percent pro-life.  She believes that life
should be protected at all stages, from conception until natural
death.

<p>

The second reason why pro-lifers do what we do is because abortion
hurts women.  As the previous example of Norma McCorvey shows,
many women are haunted by abortion, a condition now known as post-abortion
grief or trauma.

<p>

Another person who could tell you about post-abortion grief is
someone you would not expect.  Naomi Wolf, a self-proclaimed pro-choice
feminist wrote a brutally candid article in <I>The New Republic</I>
entitled, &quot;Our Bodies, Our Souls.&quot;  In it, she writes
about a Cornell-educated cardiologist who said:

<p><blockquote>

<i>I had an abortion when I was a single mother and my daughter
was 2 years old.  I would do it again.  But you know how in the
Greek myths when you kill a relative you are pursued by furies?
For months, it was as if baby furies were pursuing me.</i>

</blockquote><p>

This being pursued by &quot;baby furies&quot; is a common symptom
of post-abortion grief, as counselors from Project Rachel will
tell you.  Project Rachel, a post-abortion healing ministry, helps
both men and women find healing and forgiveness from their feelings
of loss and guilt.

<p>

The numbers of women who are experiencing this grief and who are
now willing to talk about it is reaching a critical mass.  That
is not altogether surprising considering the fact that 1.5 million
abortions take place in the United States every year.  (That's
more than 4,100 abortions every day.)  That amounts to a lot of
women who are hurting and grieving not only for the child they
have lost, but also over the weight of their own guilt.  Counselors
at crisis pregnancy centers are overwhelmed at the numbers of
women who come to them for post-abortion counseling.  These counselors
do their best to provide comfort to post-abortive mothers in their
grief, helping them find healing rather than internalizing their
guilt.

<p>

Men also suffer from post-abortion grief. <I>The Washington Post</I>
recently published an extraordinary first-person article by one
of its regular staff writers entitled, &quot;Remembering Thomas.&quot;
Phil McCombs writes:

<p><blockquote>

<i>When the abortion was performed, I was out of town on business
too.  I made sure of that.  Whatever physical, emotional and spiritual
agony the woman suffered, I was not by her side to support her.
I turned my face away.  My behavior was in all respects craven,
immoral.

<p>

For some instinctual reason, or just imaginatively, I've come
to believe that it was a boy, a son whom I wanted killed because,
at the time, his existence would have inconvenienced me. I'd
had my fun.  He didn't fit into my plans.

<p>

His name, which is carved on my heart, was Thomas.</i>

</blockquote><p>

The writer continues:

<p><blockquote>

<i>I feel like a murderer -- which isn't to say that I blame anyone
else, or think anyone else is a murderer.

<p>

It's just the way I feel, and all the rationalizations in the
world haven't changed this.  I still grieve for little Thomas.
It is an ocean of grief.  From somewhere in the distant past
I remember the phrase from Shakespeare, &quot;the multitudinous
seas incarnadine.&quot;

<p>

When I go up to the river on vacation this summer, he won't
be going boating with me on the lovely old wooden runabout that
I can't really afford to put in the water but can't bring myself
to discard, either.

<p>

He won't be lying on the grass by the tent at night, looking
at the starry sky and saying, &quot;What's that one called, Dad?&quot;

<p>

Because there was no room on the Earth for Thomas.

<p>

He's dead.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Phil McCombs found solace from his grief through Eileen C. Marx,
formerly communications director for Cardinal James A. Hickey
of Washington and now a columnist for Catholic publications.
He was able to undergo a &quot;healing process of recognition,
grieving and ultimately forgiveness.&quot;

<p>

Another way in which abortion hurts women is that it separates
men from their pregnant wives or girlfriends during the critical
time when many women most need their support.  Abortion has contributed
to the sense that women are alone in their decision-making.  This
is what happened to Thomas' mother.  Feeling a sense of abandonment,
many women choose abortion because they feel that they have no
other choice but abortion.   Indeed, the law states that abortion
is purely a decision between a woman and her 
doctor -- no spousal consent, no parental consent (in many cases).
As a result, though the father of that child is just as responsible
for helping to create the growing life in her womb, he is forbidden
from taking measures to save his child's life if the mother chooses
abortion.  On the flip side, he's also removed from bearing responsibility
for his child should she decide to keep the child.  He can very
easily say that if he gets a woman pregnant, it is of no consequence
to him.  Why should he feel any obligation to marry her or to
support that child if it is born?  After all, she could have gotten
an abortion.

<p>

Third, abortion is detrimental to society.  Abortion has changed
our perception about unborn life, hardening both men and women
to view a pregnancy first through the selfish lenses which ask
the question, &quot;How does this pregnancy help or harm <I>me</I>,
<I>my</I> future, <I>my</I> life?&quot;  Again, I will quote from
Naomi Wolf's piece, &quot;Our Bodies, Our Souls&quot; in <I>The
New Republic</I>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The pro-life warning about the potential of widespread abortion
to degrade reverence for life does have a nugget of truth:  a
free-market rhetoric about abortion can, indeed, contribute to
the eerie situation we are now facing, wherein the culture seems
increasingly to see babies not as creatures to whom parents devote
their lives but as accoutrements to enhance parental quality of
life.  Day by day, babies seem to have less value in themselves,
in a matrix of the sacred, than they do as products with a value
dictated by a market economy.

<p>

Stories surface regularly about &quot;worthless&quot; babies
left naked on gratings or casually dropped out of windows, while
&quot;valuable&quot; genetically correct babies are created at
vast expense and with intricate medical assistance for infertile
couples.  If we fail to treat abortion with grief and reverence,
we risk forgetting that, when it comes to the children we choose
to bear, we are here to serve them -- whomever they are:  they
are not here to serve us.</i>

Although a direct causal link cannot be made between the increase
in child abuse and abortion, there certainly is an association
between the two.  Since abortion became legal, the incidence of
child abuse has dramatically increased and the degree of abuse
has steadily worsened.  Perhaps it is because the two do share
a common philosophy that children exist for the parents' convenience
rather than as wards in need of parental protection and nurturance.

<p>

Each of these three broadly-defined reasons -- abortion kills
unborn human beings, abortion hurts women, and abortion is detrimental
to civilized society -- continues to resonate within the hearts
of most of us, even though like many of you, I have never known
a world without legalized abortion.

<p>

As an aside, Generation Xers seem to be even more troubled by
abortion than their immediate elders, the Baby Boomers.  But regardless
of age, public opinion polls show that the American population
at large is deeply troubled by abortion.

<p>

A September 1994 Gallup poll commissioned by CNN and <I>USA Today</I>
found that 65 percent of Americans believe that abortions should
either be &quot;illegal in all circumstances&quot; or &quot;legal
under certain circumstances.&quot;  Only 33 percent agreed that
abortions should be &quot;legal under any circumstances.&quot;

<p>

Similarly, a January 1995 CBS/<I>New York Times</I> poll found
that 60 percent believe that abortion should either &quot;not
be permitted&quot; or have &quot;stricter limits.&quot;  The view
that abortion should be &quot;generally available&quot; is shared
by only 38 percent of the population.

<p>

The dichotomy of &quot;pro-life&quot; vs. &quot;pro-choice&quot;
doesn't adequately reflect the sentiments of the American people
about abortion.  Both terms have become highly charged and badly
stereotyped.  The more accurate reflection of how the American
public feels about abortion is noted in their moral opposition
to abortion.  In other words, the debate does not hinge on the
legality of abortion, but on the morality of abortion.

<p>

This now leads me to address a couple of legislative initiatives,
because what Congress or the President does directly impacts the
American people as a whole -- the same American people of whom
a majority morally oppose abortion.

<p>

By far, the most widely-talked about initiative during this 104th
Congress was the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban.  Through this legislation,
pro-lifers sought to educate the American public first about abortion
itself and then about the specific partial-birth abortion procedure.
A majority of Americans had not been aware that abortion was
legal through all nine months of pregnancy for any or no reason.
The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban sought to show people that not
only was it legal for an abortion to occur throughout all nine
months of pregnancy, but also that a procedure as horrific as
a partial-birth abortion could be and was being used without sanction
or restriction.

<p>

For those who do not know what a partial-birth abortion is, it
involves aborting partially-delivered babies from four and a half
months into the pregnancy up to even the ninth month.  The procedure
consists of partially delivering the live baby feet first so that
all but the head is outside the mother's womb.  The head remains
in the uterus while the abortionist kills the baby by stabbing
surgical scissors into the base of its head, then suctioning out
the brain by a small tube, and then completing delivery of the
now-dead baby.

<p>

Ohio Registered Nurse Brenda Pratt Shafer, who has assisted in
three partial-birth abortions, describes the process this way:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Dr. Haskell brought the ultrasound in and hooked it up so that
he could see the baby.  On the ultrasound screen, I could see
the heart beating.  I asked Dr. Haskell, and he told me that,
&quot;Yes, that is the heartbeat.&quot;  As Dr. Haskell watched
the baby on the ultrasound screen, he went in with forceps and
grabbed the baby's legs and brought them down into the birth canal.
Then he delivered the body and the arms, all the way up to the
neck.  At this point, only the baby's head was still inside.
The baby's body was moving.  His little fingers were clasping
together.  He was kicking his feet.  All the while his little
head was still stuck inside.  Dr. Haskell took a pair of scissors
and inserted them into the back of the baby's head.  Then he opened
the scissors up.  Then he stuck the high-powered suction tube
into the hole and sucked the baby's brains out.  I almost threw
up as I watched him do these things....

<p>

I never realized how perfect these babies really are at this
point.  When you hear the word &quot;fetus,&quot; I think a lot
of people think, as I did, of just a blob of cells, or a mass
or something.  It was very revealing to me.  I don't think about
abortion the same way anymore.</i>

</blockquote><p>

The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban would make it a crime to perform
this procedure except to save the mother's life.  It is but a
modest first step in preventing the horror of late-term abortions.

<p>

According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the research arm of
Planned Parenthood, approximately 13,000 abortions every year
occur after the 20th week of pregnancy (four and a half months).
While it is not known how many of these are partial-birth abortions,
two abortionists, including Dr. Haskell, have said publicly in
different interviews that they have performed 3,000 &quot;late-term&quot;
abortions, including the partial-birth procedure, between the
two of them.

<p>

As you know, President Clinton vetoed the Partial Birth Abortion
Ban even though it passed both Houses of Congress, garnering support
from many avowed pro-choice advocates, including Reps. Patrick
Kennedy, Majority Leader Dick Gephardt, Susan Molinari, and others.
Indeed, New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said that he
would vote to override the President's veto because, he said,
the procedure is &quot;too close to infanticide.&quot;

<p>

The second legislative amendment that I'd like to discuss received
very little press this year, but was nonetheless extremely important.
It was the Coats amendment to stop discrimination in the provision
of federal funds to those medical schools which choose not to
mandate abortion training.  Last year, the
23-member Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
(ACGME) voted unanimously to pass new regulations mandating that
all medical residents specializing in obstetrics and gynecology
be trained to perform elective abortions.  Individual residents
expressing moral or religious objections would be able to opt
out of the abortion training.  However, medical institutions opposed
to abortion, such as Catholic hospitals, would still be required
-- in order to maintain their accredited status -- to provide
their students with abortion training by arranging for their students
to receive such training at another location.

<p>

Programs which fail to comply with the new
regulations risk losing their accreditation.  Accreditation status
qualifies teaching hospitals to receive federal reimbursement
for services which medical residents provide to patients.  Moreover,
doctors must ordinarily graduate from accredited training programs
to get certified as competent in their specialties.

<p>

ACGME's mandate would have substantively changed
the way in which most medical schools currently operate. The new
policy would mandate that 100 percent of medical schools provided
abortion training to their ob/gyn residents.  However, in 1991,
only 12.4 percent of medical schools provided first-trimester
abortion training on a routine basis; 56.4 percent of schools
offered it on an optional basis.  In terms of second-trimester
abortion training, only 6.7 percent of schools routinely offered
second-trimester abortion training; 58.7 percent provided optional
training.

<p>

Furthermore, about one-third of medical schools
currently refuse to provide abortion training due to moral and/or
legal reasons.  For example, Catholic-affiliated hospitals --
which make up about 20 percent of all U.S. hospitals -- do not
perform elective abortions because of religious and moral beliefs.
Other hospitals, such as the publicly financed Truman Medical
Center in Missouri, are legally prohibited from performing abortions
because laws in several states -- including Missouri -- bar the
use of taxpayer money to fund abortions.

<p>

It is a well-known fact that few physicians
are willing to perform abortions.  A Columbia University survey
found that nearly half of the ob/gyn chief residents graduating
each year have never performed a first-trimester abortion.

<p>

Commenting on the diminishing number of programs
offering elective abortion training, Dr. Richard Schmidt, a former
president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
(1977-1978) and residency review committee member, said that given
a choice, faculty and residents &quot;voted very clearly with
their feet&quot; not to perform abortions.

<p>

On behalf of those physicians who &quot;voted with their feet&quot;
and those medical institutions with moral objections to abortion,
pro-lifers succeeded in urging Congress to pass -- and the President
to sign -- a bill which would provide permanent protection for
medical schools that decline to provide abortion training.  This
law, first introduced by Senator Dan Coats, protects medical schools
from a loss of federal funds that would have occurred under the
ACGME's untenable directive.

<p>

In addition, pro-lifers have also worked to advance many other
legislative initiatives such as limiting federal funding for abortion
through the Hyde Amendment, promoting adoption as a pro-life alternative,
and halting human embryo experimentation, among many others. 
While I won't go into detail about these latter legislative items,
I hope that the discussion of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban and
the ACGME abortion training mandate has sufficiently served to
demonstrate how the pro-life community has been involved on the
policy level to promote a pro-life message.

<p>

In closing, I ask that each of you, as future physicians and health
policy experts, consider the case for life.  Examine closely the
role which you will play, for it may not be too far in the future
when you personally stand face-to-face with a decision regarding
abortion, or physician-assisted suicide, or fetal tissue transplantation,
or human embryo research.  Now, more than ever, technological
advances in medicine require physicians to give thought to ethical
considerations.  Thus, it is vitally important for each of you
to possess a moral grounding, an underlying philosophy for what
you choose to do.  I hope that I have given you some insight not
only into <I>what</I> the pro-life community advocates, but <I>why</I>
we so strongly believe as we do.

<p>

Thank you very much.

<title>PROMOTING TRUE ABSTINENCE IN THE ADOLESCENT FAMILY LIFE ACT</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>PROMOTING TRUE ABSTINENCE<br>
IN THE ADOLESCENT FAMILY LIFE ACT</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Testimony of Gracie S. Hsu, Policy Analyst, Family Research Council<br>
before the Labor/HHS/Education Subcommittee<br>
of the Senate Appropriations Committee<br>
July 11, 1996</h4></center>

<p>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As you are well aware, the Family Research
Council (FRC) has long been an advocate of premarital sexual abstinence
and of saving sex for its proper context within marriage.  We
also strongly encourage adoption as a superior alternative to
abortion.

<p>

In the past, the Family Research Council has also supported the
Adolescent Family Life (AFL) Act, or Title XX of the Public Health
Service Act, because it has historically been a solid abstinence-centered
and adoption-promoting program.  Indeed, the AFL legislation was
crafted in order to sponsor programs and research projects which
promote society's traditional sexual ethic of abstinence until
marriage.  The AFL Act articulates a compelling moral framework
for reversing the tide of adolescent promiscuity, out-of-wedlock
pregnancy and abortion, for it recognizes the fact that sex is
not simply a physical act, but that it also has moral, emotional,
and social consequences.

<p>

The two primary purposes of AFL are:

<p>

(1) To find effective means, within the context of the family,
of reaching adolescents before they become sexually active in
order to maximize the guidance and support available to them from
parents and other family members, and to promote self-discipline
and other prudent approaches to the problem of adolescent premarital
sexual relations, including pregnancy; and

<p>

(2) To promote adoption as an alternative for adolescent parents
(Sec. 2001 (b), (1) and (2) of the Public Health Service Act).

<p>

For years, AFL has stood alone in a sea of contraceptive funding,
promoting prevention rather than simply risk reduction.  Even
with its limited annual budget of about $7 million, AFL has succeeded
in helping young people choose the healthiest lifestyle of premarital
sexual abstinence.  Some AFL program successes include <I>Teen-Aid</I>,
<I>Choosing the Best</I>, <I>The Art of Loving Well</I>, and <I>Reasonable
Reasons to Wait</I>.

<p>

However, while the stated mission of AFL has remained unchanged,
in recent years, the policies undergirding AFL's mission have
been under attack by the Clinton administration, and thus, the
program's laudable characteristics have been compromised.

<p>

For example, this administration placed Felicia Hance Stewart,
a former Planned Parenthood abortionist and long-time advocate
of contraception, in charge of the Office of Population Affairs,
which oversees not only Title X, the federal family planning program,
but also AFL, the abstinence program.  Clearly, Dr. Stewart and
the Clinton administration do not subscribe to an abstinence-centered
philosophy, and their efforts to undercut and even defund AFL
are well-established.

<p>

As you will recall, the Clinton administration sought to completely
defund AFL for fiscal year 1995 and replace it with a new Office
of Adolescent Health, which would be dedicated to more &quot;comprehensive&quot;
health education and contraceptive information and services to
teens.  That this administration would consider eliminating the
only source of federal funding for teen abstinence and adoption
programs in favor of more contraceptive programs (which already
receive some $450 million every year through Title X, Medicaid,
and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, among others funding
streams) clearly demonstrates not only the administration's lack
of support for abstinence programs, but also its outright hostility
towards their existence.

<p>

Although the Clinton administration did not succeed in its attempt
to defund the AFL program, it has since engaged in other tactics
which undermine the program's promotion of a true abstinence-centered
message.

<p>

For example, under President Clinton, the Health and Human Services
Department modified the policy regulations regarding AFL grant
applications.  Printed in the Federal Register, this administration's
policy guidelines omit all references to parents' central role
and, indeed, even subvert AFL's core purpose of promoting abstinence-centered
programs by soliciting grant applications from contraceptive-based
projects.

<p>

Please allow me to delineate this point further.  During the Bush
administration, the Federal Register announcing AFL grant applications
stated the following:

<p>

&quot;Applications requesting support for prevention projects
should propose innovative, value-based, family-centered approaches
to promoting adolescent premarital abstinence.  Applicants should
promote parents as the primary sex educators of their children
and emphasize the provision of support by other family members,
voluntary associations, religious and charitable organizations
and other groups in the private sector in order to help adolescents
and their families deal with complex issues of adolescent premarital
sexual relations.&quot;  (Federal Register, Vol. 57, No. 19, January
29, 1992)

<p>

Under President Clinton, however, the policy guidelines regulating
the AFL program differed dramatically.  The December 22, 1994
Federal Register stated the following:

<p>

&quot;The OAPP encourages the submission of prevention applications
which propose to do the following:....(4) include medically accurate
information on sexuality, contraception, sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs) and HIV/AIDS, (5) offer educational services to
parents to assist them in communicating with their children about
sexuality, contraception, STDs and HIV/AIDS...&quot;

<p>

Mr. Chairman, as you can see from this example, the Clinton Administration
believes that parents are not the primary sex educators of their
children, but that the educational establishment must help parents
teach their children about sex.  This administration also believes
that AFL should not be a true abstinence program, but a contraceptive-based
program.  This double message about sex not only contradicts the
AFL program's stated mission, it also harms children in the process.

<p>

Therefore, Mr. Chairman, if the AFL program is to continue, with
or without increased funding, it is vitally important that the
language of the legislation be altered to reflect a true abstinence-centered
and adoption-promoting message.  We must prevent the current and
future administrations from wrongly interpreting the AFL statute.

<p>

The Family Research Council proposes that this committee take
into consideration the Faircloth-Talent abstinence language passed
within H.R. 4, the recent welfare bill that was vetoed by the
President. Under such explicit language, only true abstinence-centered
programs would be able to receive funding.  We believe that this
legislative step is necessary in order to remedy the executive
branch's tampering with the program.  Unless such a step is taken,
however, FRC cannot endorse the expansion of a program that is
so vulnerable to be used for harmful purposes.

<p>

Finally, I'd like to comment on the Family Research Council's
viewpoint regarding the government's role in funding social programs
which seek to promote any form of sexual behavior.  FRC strongly
believes that the responsibility for sex education belongs to
the parents of children.  We also believe that the federal government
does not have a legitimate role in federally subsidizing contraceptive
programs, or even abstinence programs.  Indeed, we have only advocated
for the existence of AFL in order to counter the federal government's
aggressive role in promoting contraceptive-based programs.  Therefore,
if the government is to play a role at all, it should at a minimum
sustain and promote self-restraint and marital commitment rather
than subverting them.

<p>

Mr. Chairman, we ask that you would take FRC's recommendations
under consideration.  Thank you very much.

<TITLE>THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT: IT'S TIME TO FREE THE ARTS</TITLE>

<H2>THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT:<BR>
IT'S TIME TO FREE THE ARTS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Robert H. Knight</I></CENTER>
<P>
After years of debate and attempted reform, it has become clear
that the National Endowment for the Arts is beyond reclamation
and should be zero-budgeted by the 104th Congress. 
<P>
Particularly with regard to the visual arts (drawing, painting
and sculpting) and &quot;performance&quot; arts (theater, film,
live acts), the NEA has been a platform for attacks on religion,
traditional art forms, traditional families and traditional values,
and a forum for the promotion of homosexuality.  In the name of
tolerance, it has shown increasing intolerance toward standards
of any kind, including ordinary standards of artistic skill. 
Its peer review process has long been a buddy system for awarding
grants to colleagues, friends and clients of panel members, who
are almost uniformly hostile to traditional culture.   
<P>
However, even if the federal agency did manage to clean up its
act, the entire idea of government sponsorship of art is a bad
one.  Whenever the government decides to subsidize one artist
and not another, the government, in effect, determines what is
art and what is not.
<P>
Unlike any other arts sponsor, the federal government has unique
authority and responsibility.  Its powers derive from its claim
to represent all Americans and its money from mandatory taxes.
 NEA grants greatly influence what is presented in museums and
theaters and what private donors feel is worthy of support.  As
former NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer noted: &quot;Our grantees
state unequivocally that fund-raising is substantially easier
because of an Endowment grant.  It is an endorsement -- a mark
of quality and achievement.&quot;[1]
<P>
And what has the NEA done with this awesome responsibility? 
<P>
Since its founding, the NEA has openly favored the avant-garde
-- defined by <I>Webster's Third New International Unabridged
Dictionary</I> as: &quot;Those who 
create, produce or apply new, original or experimental ideas,
designs, techniques...and sometimes: a group that is extremist,
bizarre, or arty and affected.&quot;[2]  Unfortunately, the NEA seems
to have taken the latter portion of the definition to heart. 
There is a place, of course, for experimental art, but it should
be funded privately, not by taxpayers whose money often is used
to disparage their most deeply held beliefs.
<P>
As a federal agency, the NEA should not be fostering a bias toward
one particular art style over another.  In fact its own grant
guidelines specifically forbid it to do so or attempt to direct
artistic content.[3]
<P>
One reason the NEA has been able to promote bad art without public
scrutiny is that the media are not telling the whole story.  TV
broadcasters and newspapers are restrained by the bounds of good
taste from reproducing the most offensive works funded by the
NEA.  A January 2, 1991 <I>Los Angeles Times </I>article about
an NEA grant to performance artist Karen Finley described her
work only as &quot;strongly feminist in tone.&quot;[4] This leaves
the impression that Finley, who calls herself the &quot;Queen
of Dung,&quot; is controversial merely for being a feminist, not
because of her vulgarities.  
<P>
Because of this kind of obfuscation, most Americans have only
an abstract concept of the works in question.  Senator Jesse Helms,
the NEA's most active critic, has offered to debate the issue
on any TV network providing he can show viewers what is being
debated.  All have refused.  And for good reason.  If NBC-TV actually
aired some NEA-funded works, it would violate Federal Communications
Commission rules against obscenity and risk losing its broadcasting
license.  One federal agency would find itself prosecuting a company
for displaying materials sponsored by another federal agency.
<P>
<H3><CENTER>THE CHAIRMAN'S VIEWS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Under the chairmanship of actress Jane Alexander, the NEA has
not curbed its hostility toward traditional values.  In fact,
Alexander told the homosexual magazine <I>The Advocate</I> that
she intended to use the NEA to &quot;introduce people gently to
gay themes all across the country. And I mean gently, because
if you start with a kind of very overt thing, people get scared....
 You gently bring in gay people and introduce them to the world
through art.&quot;[5]
<P>
When asked, &quot;What sorts of grants would you reject out of
hand,&quot; Alexander answered: &quot;It's hard to say at this
point if there is any grant that I might reject.&quot;[6]
<P>
Indeed, Alexander later defended a performance in February 1994
at the NEA-funded Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in which an
HIV-positive performer, Ron Athey, sliced into another man's back
with a knife, mopped up the blood with towels and sent them on
clotheslines over the horrified audience.  He also had two female
assistants weave acupuncture needles through his own scalp and,
in turn, pierced the women's cheeks with steel spikes.[7]
<P>
Asked by a reporter what she thought of the performance, Alexander
replied that she trusted the judgment of the Walker management,
and said, &quot;Not all art is for everybody....  Americans are
certainly not used to seeing bloodletting, except in films, and
when it happens in person, it must be surprising.&quot;  Alexander
added that she thought &quot;all appropriate precautions&quot;
regarding health had been taken, &quot;So what are we left with
that was considered controversial?  The sacrification [sic], the
ritual-like aspect?  Is it that the man is homosexual?&quot;[8]
<P>
Congress responded to Alexander's lack of action by cutting $4
million from the NEA budget.  Athey then performed his act at
another NEA-funded theater, New York's P.S. 122.  &quot;With full
knowledge of this,&quot; culture critics David Horowitz and Laurence
Jarvik note, &quot;The NEA again funded both P.S. 122 and the
Walker Art Center in the most recent grant cycle.  Plainly, the
agency is deaf to the concerns of Congress and the public.&quot;[9]
<P>
Some of the more serious problems[10] at the NEA include:
<P>
- Bias against religion; rejecting positive portrayals of religion
as violating the separation of church and state, but funding attacks
on religion as &quot;artistic expression&quot;;
<P>
- Elevation of &quot;freedom of expression&quot; and &quot;artistic
merit&quot; as the main criteria for grants, ignoring the NEA's
charter legislation of 1965, which set &quot;encouragement of
excellence&quot; as the No. 1 criterion, followed by &quot;access
to the arts for all Americans&quot;;  
<P>
- Confusion in upper management about how to comply with congressionally-mandated
standards;
<P>
- Confusion about the NEA's primary mission;
<P>
- Conflicts of interest in the grant-awarding process;
<P>
- A bureaucracy openly hostile to public scrutiny;
<P>
- Bias against traditional forms of art and traditional values
in general.
<P>
<H3><CENTER>HOSTILITY TOWARD RELIGION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The First Amendment prohibits Congress (and federal agencies authorized
by Congress) to infringe on religious liberties.  It is clearly
unconstitutional to use federal tax dollars to create and distribute
an attack on religious beliefs.  The government has no business
dictating the value of religious beliefs or prescribing changes
in them. 
<P>
Yet the taxpayer-supported NEA over the years has funded works
that degrade or mock religious belief, particularly Christianity.
<P>
- In June, 1993, the Whitney Museum of American Art, which received
$200,000 from the NEA during 1992-1993, displayed <I>Abject Art:
Repulsion and Desire in American Art</I>.  The exhibit's journal
explains the focus: &quot;Although 'abject art' is a play on 'object
art,' the term does not connote an art movement so much as it
describes a body of work which incorporates or suggests abject
materials such as dirt, hair, excrement, dead animals, menstrual
blood, and rotting food in order to confront taboo issues of gender
and sexuality....  Employing methodologies adapted from feminism,
queer theory, post-structuralism, Marxism, and psychoanalysis,
our goal is to talk dirty in the institution [of art] and degrade
its atmosphere of purity and prudery by foregrounding issues of
gender and sexuality in the art exhibited.&quot;[11]
<P>
The Whitney show included works by Joel-Peter Witkin, who received
four fellowship grants from the NEA: Fiscal year 1980, $3,000;
FY 1981 $12,500; FY 1986, $15,000; FY 1992, $20,000.[12] Witkin's
work includes &quot;Maquette for Crucifix,&quot; a naked Jesus
Christ surrounded by sado-masochistic obscene imagery, and many
grotesque portrayals of corpses and body parts.  Another Whitney
exhibit was a film by Suzie Silver titled &quot;A Spy,&quot; which
depicts Jesus Christ as a woman standing naked with breasts exposed.
 The Whitney also included &quot;Piss Christ,&quot; Andres Serrano's
photograph of a crucifix in a jar of urine, and a film by porn
star Annie Sprinkle titled &quot;The Sluts and Goddesses Video
Workshop or How to be a Sex Goddess in 101 Easy Steps.&quot;[13] Sprinkle
has performed numerous times in NEA-funded venues such as Highways
in Los Angeles and The Kitchen Theater in New York, where she
has had audience members come on stage to examine her exposed
genitals.
<P>
- Diamanda Galas, who was The Kitchen Theater's first artist-in-residence,
performed &quot;Plague Mass&quot; at the Cathedral of St. John
the Divine in Manhattan in 1990, during which she appeared topless
and covered with blood.[14] A member of ACT-UP, the AIDS activist
group, she was arrested during a demonstration at St. Patrick's
Cathedral in New York in 1989.[15] On July 8, 1993, she opened the
Serious Fun Festival at Lincoln Center, which was supported by
a $14,700 dance grant from the NEA.[16] As the New York Times explains,
&quot;Conceptually, her work is close to that of the late David
Wojnarowicz, the visual artist-writer who died of AIDS in 1992.&quot;
 In 1990, the NEA gave a $15,000 grant to Wojnarowicz, who specialized
in photographs of men performing oral sex, anal sex, anal-oral
sex and masturbation.  An essay in one of his exhibits described
New York's John Cardinal O'Connor as &quot;a fat cannibal from
that house of walking swastikas up on fifth avenue,&quot; and
a &quot;creep in black skirts.&quot;[17]
<P>
- Anti-Christian material is distributed through the NEA-supported
Video Data Bank at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.[18]
The following are a couple of the offerings, with descriptions
cited from &quot;Gay and Lesbian Tapes Distributed by the Video
Data Bank&quot;:
<P>
<I>Popular Thought</I>.  This video equates the &quot;moral majority&quot;
with totalitarianism.  &quot;UThe message reverberates with the
interweaving of archival footage of Nazi Youth, book burnings
and modern day Ohio Youth for Jesus creating an audiovisual fabric
of hatredU -- Carole Ann Klonarides.&quot;
<P>
<I>Peccatum Mutum (The Silent Sin)</I>.  &quot;...explores relationships
among cloistered nuns....  Utilizing gothic expressionistic sets,
humor, serious kissing, and melodrama, this work expresses the
contradictions and ironic similarities between physical desire
and spiritual fervor.  A rare glimpse at the other side of Catholic
guilt.&quot;
<P>
<H3><CENTER>TARGETING THE FAMILY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Promotion of &quot;alternative lifestyles&quot; has long been
a staple of NEA grants.  A case in point is, again, NEA support
of the Video Data Bank, which offers these films and accompanying
synopses:[19]
<P>
- <I>Swamp</I>.  &quot;This subversive soap opera targets the
family, psychotherapy and property as the villains.&quot;
<P>
- <I>A Coalminer's Granddaughter</I>.  &quot;This hysterically
funny epic about a brutally realistic American family does for
lesbians what John Waters did for Baltimore....  Under the thumb
of her sleazy, evil father (brilliantly portrayed by novelist
Kevin Killian) Jane is not the hero of her own life....  <I>Coal
Miner's Granddaughter</I> opens up into the impressionistic world
of her sexuality...highly charged sexuality [that makes] staples
of lesbian erotica seem tepid and silly.&quot;
<P>
- <I>Talk to Me Like the Rain</I>.  &quot;...two brothers whose
incestuous behavior feeds a disillusionment in the trust and faith
with one another [sic].&quot;
<P>
- <I>Stephen</I>.  &quot;This production focuses on the story
of siblings and, in this case, twins locked in a complex, emotional
and sexual relationship....  In the end, the expectations of both
religion and a modern world are abandoned....&quot;
<P>
- <I>The A Ha! Experience</I>.  &quot;...explores the erotic elements
of mother-infant intimacy that are repeated in the oedipal devaluation
of the mother, the object of desire for the daughter.&quot;
<P>
<H3><CENTER>PROMOTING HOMOSEXUALITY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
By validating the pro-homosexual viewpoint through taxpayer-supported
government grants, the NEA has helped legitimize pro-homosexual
theater in general.  <I>New York Newsday</I> arts critic Linda
Winer notes that: &quot;The fact is, much of the theater these
days is gay....  Indeed, much of it has been for a very long time....
 This season there have been so many gay projects that I've been
searching for an alternative to the term 'straight play' when
describing a nonmusical.&quot;[20]
<P>
NEA-funded venues such as The Woolly Mammoth Theatre in Washington,
D.C., The Franklin Furnace and The Kitchen in New York, Highways
in Los Angeles, and countless other NEA-funded theater groups
around the country present works promoting homosexuality and blasting
traditional morality.  The NEA also supports pro-homosexual projects
shown on the Public Broadcasting System.  Some recent examples
of pro-homosexual, NEA-supported works:
<P>
- In April, 1994, Woolly Mammoth staged NEA grant recipient Tim
Miller's one-man performance, &quot;My Queer Body,&quot; in which
he, among other things, describes what it's like to have sex with
another man, climbs naked into the lap of a spectator, and finally
arouses himself sexually in full view of the audience.[21]
<P>
- In January, 1994, the Public Broadcasting Service showed <I>Tales
of the City</I>, a three-part miniseries celebrating homosexual
life in San Francisco in the 1970s.  The series was full of gratuitous
nudity, crudity, lewdness and dozens of instances of foul language.
 Families are lampooned and homosexuality is portrayed as superior.
 The series was co-produced by American Playhouse, which received
$750,000 in NEA funds in 1993.  NEA received an on-screen credit
as a supporter of the film. 
<P>
- In August 1994, the Public Broadcasting Service aired <I>One
Nation Under God</I>, a misleading, one-sided documentary by two
homosexual activists that attempts to discredit ex-gay therapy
and counseling.[22] The NEA is credited as a main sponsor for the
film, which links Christian ministries to Nazi techniques such
as shock/aversion therapy, a practice which has long been denounced
by the ex-gay movement.  The film misportrays several homosexual
activists, misrepresents Evelyn Hooker's psychological studies
of homosexual men in the 1950's, and uses Biblical references
out of context.  The film also takes quotes from several therapists
and former homosexuals out of context.  In one clip, a former
homosexual explains that he used to think that &quot;God hates
homosexuals,&quot; but that he now knows that God loves them.
 The filmmakers include only the fragment, &quot;God hates homosexuals,&quot;
reversing the man's intended meaning.  Dr. Elizabeth Moberly,
author of <I>Psychogenesis</I> and founder of a Pennsylvania-based,
ex-gay ministry, says the filmmakers misrepresented themselves,
took her out of context in her taped interview and distorted severely
what she and other therapists had said.[23] The film was shown at
several gay and lesbian film festivals during the summer of 1994
and at the 1995 Gay Games and Cultural Festival in New York City.
 Over the years, the NEA has supported several gay and lesbian
film festivals, which have presented hard-core pornography and
anti-religious themes.[24]
<P>
- The NEA-supported Video Data Bank at the School of the Art Institute
of Chicago offers numerous homosexual films.  <I>Danny</I>, a
20-minute documentary, includes footage touting &quot; Uthe raw
sensuality of cruising and anonymous encountersU -- Robert Rosenberg,
Global Village.&quot;  <I>Jollies</I> is an 11-minute film by
Sadie Benning, who &quot;recounts her earliest sexual encounters.&quot;
 Another Benning work, <I>Me and Rubyfruit</I>, &quot;chronicles
the enchantment of teenage lesbian love.&quot;  Other titles in
the catalog are frankly pornographic.   
<P>
<H3><CENTER>TALKING POINTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Curbing the NEA would amount to censorship, and that's against
the First Amendment, isn't it?</B>
<P>
The First Amendment to the Constitution states that &quot;Congress
shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom
of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peacefully
to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot;
<P>
The Constitution limits the federal government and, by extension
of the 14th Amendment, the states, from censoring protected speech,
as defined over the years by Supreme Court cases.  It does not
limit individual citizens nor private groups, which have freedom
to maintain their own standards of decency and their own viewpoints.
 The issue is one of sponsorship, not censorship.  There is no
constitutional &quot;right&quot; of an artist to a subsidy from
his fellow taxpayers.  
<P>
<B>But won't the arts collapse without federal aid?</B>
<P>
More than $9 billion in private giving sustains arts in communities
all over America.[25} The NEA's $175 million is important more for
its symbolism than for the actual dollars involved.   An NEA grant
validates an artist, and the government should not be in the business
of determining what is art.  That process smacks of &quot;official&quot;
art, such as is imposed on the artistic communities in totalitarian
societies.
<P>
<B>Can the NEA be reformed?</B>
<P>
No, it can't.  Congress has tried several times to rein in the
rogue agency, including appointing an independent commission to
study the NEA in 1990.  With some fanfare, the NEA adopted a few
reforms, but continued to fund the worst excesses in the art world.
 Even after Congress slightly cut the NEA's budget in 1994 as
a message of discontent, it continued to shovel money to artists
whose primary purpose is to insult the majority of taxpayers.
 Also, NEA officials consistently have displayed an arrogant disregard
for the taxpayers.  Even a pro-reform arts critic, the late Samuel
Lipman, who had been a member of the National Council on the Arts
during the 1980s, finally came to the conclusion in the 1990s
that the agency was irreparable and should be abolished.
<P>
<B>Besides ending subsidies for bad art, are there any other reasons
to defund NEA?</B>
<P>
Yes.  The federal deficit is out of control, so Congress must
find ways to cut back without endangering infrastructure.  Before
1965, the United States got along just fine without federal art
subsidies, which are a product of the Great Society's massive
government expansion.   Also, NEA funds are distributed in a grossly
distorted fashion, with certain areas such as New York, Los Angeles
and Minnesota receiving far more money than other states and cities.
 And many grants go to artists who are already successful and
do not need the money.  Finally, ending federal subsidies would
put a dent in cultural imperialism; pampered artists could no
longer use the federal government to tell the rest of the nation
what is art and what isn't.  Pulling the plug on NEA money would
mean that communities would support the arts that the people in
those communities wanted -- not the art that is dictated from
Washington, D.C.

<P>
Over the past decade, the federal government has spent billions
of dollars on HIV research, which has been geared predominantly
toward end-stage HIV (full-blown AIDS).  In Fiscal Year 1995,
the U.S. Public Health Service will spend $2.7 billion directly
on AIDS, the highest expenditure for any of the nation's 10 most
lethal diseases.[1]
<P>
AIDS ranks near the bottom of the list of the top 10 mortal diseases
and accounts for about 35,000 deaths annually.  Heart disease
claims 720,000 lives annually, and cancer kills 505,000.  Yet
the federal government will spend more on AIDS than on heart disease
($828 million) and cancer ($2.4 billion).[2]
<P>
The point is not that AIDS should cease receiving attention. 
HIV is a contagious disease and its victims deserve compassion
and help.  Funding should continue for treatment, prevention and
care.  However, AIDS funding must be brought into line with expenditures
for other life-threatening diseases, and the money must be redirected
toward more effective approaches.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>A CHANGING EPIDEMIC</CENTER></H3>
<P>
The scourge of AIDS, which began in America among white, male
homosexuals, has moved into poor, minority communities, driven
by prostitution, drug abuse and promiscuous sex.  Yet most AIDS
funding is still directed by, for and to the original target population.
<P>
AIDS funding generally is allocated according to the numbers of
people who ever have contracted AIDS -- including those who already
have died -- not those currently diagnosed with HIV.  This formula
has, for example, directed money to white, homosexual AIDS groups
in San Francisco while cities which now may have greater numbers
of HIV-infected patients get less financial aid.  The CDC has
reported that 55 percent of AIDS cases in 1993 came from minority
communities, with blacks having the worst rate of all the groups.[3]
Black women were approximately 15 times more likely than white
women to get AIDS, and black men were five times more likely to
get AIDS than white men.[4]
<P>
For many years, AIDS policy has been driven by the demands of
HIV-infected people who dominate AIDS organizations.  Their situations
are tragic, and their focus on finding a cure is understandable.
 But because of their considerable influence, the lion's share
of AIDS funding has been spent for treatment of end-stage HIV
(AIDS) and not on the full spectrum of HIV disease. 
<P>
Even the prevention efforts have been tailored toward protecting
the identities of those with HIV rather than toward measures that
have proven effective in stemming other serious epidemics.  Much
government time at AIDS conferences has been spent on perfecting
&quot;nonjudgmental&quot; vernacular, such as substituting &quot;people
living with HIV&quot; for the word &quot;victim&quot; or even
the word &quot;patient&quot; in order to reduce stigma.  In the
same vein, concern for confidentiality, while important, has been
overemphasized, and sound medical procedures have been thwarted
and often ignored.  The first step in stopping an epidemic is
identifying, on a confidential basis, those who have the disease.
 This process has been hampered by federally-funded AIDS activists,
who have defeated efforts to increase early diagnosis and confidential
partner notification, the surest ways to pinpoint the disease
and to help check its spread. 
<P>
Furthermore, the federal government's preventative response to
the epidemic has consisted largely of a million-dollar ad campaign
promoting condoms and hundreds of millions of dollars for AIDS
education that targets schoolchildren, acquainting them with graphic
materials explaining the various ways AIDS is transmitted, whether
they are at risk or not.  At the same time, populations that are
most at risk for HIV transmission are under-served, particularly
in black or Hispanic communities.
<P>
The current premise of many AIDS prevention efforts is that <I>uninfected</I>
persons have primary responsibility for stemming the epidemic,
not those already infected.  The focus must be changed to make
personal responsibility on the part of those infected the foundation
of future programs. 
<P>
The most successful AIDS eradication program in America has been
run by the U.S. armed forces.  Early diagnosis is the key.  Since
1985, every member of the military has been screened regularly
for HIV, resulting in a depth of knowledge about the disease that
is unparalleled.  Unlike civilian doctors, military medical personnel
are not &quot;flying blind&quot; in this epidemic and are getting
early treatment and notification to those affected.  There is
no &quot;AIDS epidemic&quot; in the military because aggressive
knowledge-based intervention prevents the spread of disease.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>IDEAS FOR POLICY MAKERS</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Here are some proposals to overhaul federal AIDS programs, with
thanks to Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy, a nonpartisan
Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group, for their
wise counsel on several of these points: 
<P>
<LI><B>Initiate prenatal HIV testing for all pregnant women</B>,
with an opt-out for those who want it.  Twenty-six percent of
HIV-infected mothers transmit the disease to their babies today
in the United States.  However, mothers who do not know they are
HIV-positive can unwittingly transmit it to the 74 percent of
uninfected babies by breast-feeding.  Furthermore, research shows
that when HIV-infected mothers are treated with the drug AZT,
the transmission rate drops from 26 percent to 8 percent.  Thus
knowledge of HIV status can save many lives.
<P>
<LI><B>Begin HIV partner notification programs in all 50 states,
the District of Columbia and U.S. territories</B>.  Partner tracing
is the fastest way to alert those in danger of infection and is
standard public health procedure for virtually all contagious
and sexually transmitted diseases.  Earlier this century, epidemics
of gonorrhea and syphilis were greatly reduced using this time-proven
procedure. 
<P>
<LI><B>Guarantee confidentiality to all who are tested.</B>  Concern
over misuse of HIV status has been the main obstacle to effective
testing programs.  But public health departments have reported
more than 400,000 cases of AIDS to the CDC without a single breach
of confidentiality in any of the 50 states.  Moreover, venereal
disease testing has been done for years without any serious breach-of-confidentiality problem. 
<P>
<LI><B>Overhaul the Ryan White Act</B>, which dispenses about $650
million annually in federal funds.  The Ryan White Act is due
to expire in 1995.  Hearings need to be held to examine how the
money is being spent.  And the spending formulas should include
the following changes:
<P>
1) Only those infected with HIV or AIDS who need care should receive
benefits.  Formulas based on &quot;AIDS prevalence&quot; distort
funding needs because they count the dead along with the living.
 Money ought to go where it is needed most, which is, increasingly,
to under-served minority communities.
<P>
2) People with HIV or AIDS should qualify where they are currently
living, not where they were diagnosed.  Slating funds to areas
of diagnosis misses areas where AIDS patients are actually residing.
 For example, someone might be diagnosed with AIDS in a large
city, but return home to a suburban or rural area for care.
<P>
3) Means testing for AIDS care dollars should be introduced. 
Those with adequate insurance should not be in the same pool with
those who truly have no other means of payment.
<P>
<LI><B>Overhaul HIV/AIDS education</B>, which now emphasizes condoms
and has not been shown to be effective.  In fact, programs seeking
funding renewal should be required to show evidence that they
have reduced HIV transmission. 
<P>
Sex education should be geared toward abstinence education and
knowledge of HIV status.  True abstinence programs (not those
that merely mention abstinence and then focus on contraception)
are the only sex education programs that have been proven to alter
behavior in positive ways.  &quot;Comprehensive&quot; (contraceptive-based)
programs have been proven to have either no effect or to actually
encourage earlier or more frequent sexual experimentation.  The
key to stopping AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases is
not in the promotion of condoms but in the promotion of delayed
sexual activity and early knowledge of infection.  In a recent
test, three groups of people were monitored: 1) a group who received
HIV education, 2) a control group with no HIV education and 3)
a group who received HIV education, and who also underwent an
HIV test.  Only the latter group registered any behavioral change.
 Testing in and of itself heightens consciousness of the seriousness
of premature or promiscuous sex.
<P>
The federal AIDS education campaign has emphasized condoms first
and has treated abstinence as a largely unrealistic goal, even
though medical experts agree that it is the most medically sound
response.  Condoms are seen by some as a way of continuing high-risk
behavior regardless of HIV status.  But no honest medical professional
would recommend that an uninfected person have sex with an HIV-infected
partner using a condom for protection.  Condoms can reduce the
risk in a single encounter, but not to where it is anywhere near
acceptable to be considered in the context of &quot;prevention.&quot;
<P>
The CDC has even misrepresented the concept of abstinence, stating
in its literature that there is a &quot;26 percent failure rate
for periodic abstinence.&quot;[5] What they are really describing
is &quot;periodic sex.&quot;  There is no such thing as &quot;periodic
abstinence.&quot;  To understand the absurdity of this statement,
try imagining the police describing a burglar as having a 26 percent
&quot;periodic honesty&quot; failure rate.  Funding for all federal
AIDS programs that promote condom use and misrepresent abstinence
should be halted immediately.  Sex education programs under Title
X (a program that was a colossal, $3 billion failure over two
decades) should be zeroed out.
<P>
<LI><B>Focus research on the &quot;full spectrum&quot; of HIV</B>,
from inception on, instead of merely focusing on HIV's final stage
(AIDS).  Dr. Robert Redfield of Walter Reed Hospital notes that
finding a &quot;cure&quot; for this tricky retrovirus is only
a distant possibility (and still a worthy goal), but that early
detection is the key to prevention.[6] Also, research subject pools
need to include more women and people from minority communities,
where the epidemic is increasing at the fastest rates.
<P>
<LI><B>Change the formula for the Centers for Disease Control's
prevention planning committees.</B> They are currently biased
toward white, homosexual men, although the HIV epidemic has shifted
toward minority communities.  Testing authorization should not
be limited to licensed phlebotomists but expanded to include small,
trained groups that can operate within minority communities inexpensively
and efficiently, using the Orasure saliva-test collection device
recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
<P>
<LI><B>Support distribution of the saliva-based HIV test</B>, approval
of which was held up for nearly four years by the FDA.  The test
is a reliable, inexpensive and convenient way to detect HIV. 
The sample is processed in a lab, so public health professionals
can track the epidemic when names are gained through confidential
testing.  Conversely, an<I> anonymous</I> home test backed by
AIDS activist groups would help &quot;drive the epidemic underground,&quot;
a concern voiced, ironically, by those same groups whenever the
testing issue is raised.  Anonymous home tests would discourage
people from being tested in a manner that fosters early counseling
and treatment and that could be tracked by public health professionals,
and it would severely limit the impact of partner-notification
programs that are under way in many states.  Furthermore, the
trauma of discovering that one has HIV infection, experienced
alone, could lead some to suicide. 
<P>
Although concerns of confidentiality are not to be taken lightly,
the idea of anonymous HIV testing is being driven by the notion
that the primary responsibility for the epidemic should fall on
those who are uninfected, not on those who have the virus.  
<P>
<LI><B>Require routine testing of patients and health care workers.
</B> Both parties should be notified of the results.  Ignorance
of infection has never aided the cause of good medical care. 
In many cases, women do not show early signs of HIV infection,
and the first indication comes when the patient is actually dying
of AIDS.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</CENTER></H3>
<P>
In testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in
1991, Dr. Robert Redfield said, &quot;The chilling reality is
that the AIDS epidemic of the next decade has already occurred.
 Central to the military response was the recognition of HIV infection
for what it is -- a sexually transmitted, progressively fatal
infection, which, although not yet curable, is treatable and preventable.&quot;
<P>
The AIDS epidemic of the year 2000, indeed, has occurred already.
 In fact, it took place around 1990.  The HIV virus' incubation
period typically takes 10 years, so when public policy makers
are addressing full-blown AIDS in 1995, they are dealing with
behavior and causes that occurred in 1985.  While care of AIDS
patients and basic AIDS research is essential, prevention efforts
need to be targeted toward current patterns of behavior and the
current population groups most adversely affected.  Homosexual
white males still account for the largest number of AIDS cases,
but the growth in HIV infections increasingly is among poor, black
and Hispanic urban dwellers, including women.  It's time to gear
the federal AIDS effort toward sound, time-tested medical procedures
such as early diagnosis, reporting and confidential partner notification,
and it's time to make individual responsibility the touchstone
of public policy.

Authorization for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is due
to expire at the end of 1996.  But Congress must appropriate money
each year.  The new 104th Congress should decline to do so. 
<P>
There is no reason Congress should force the taxpayers to continue
subsidizing this outdated system, much of which (the best parts)
would survive nicely without federal aid.
<P>
The CPB, overseer of the Public Broadcasting Service and National
Public Radio, was created in 1967 to meet a perceived need for
taxpayer-financed alternative programming not provided by commercial
networks.  That need, if there ever was one, has passed.  The
advent of cable television, satellite dishes and improved radio
technology has created an enormous menu of broadcasting choices
for consumers.  America has more than 11,700 radio stations and
more than 3,100 television licensees, plus 109 cable networks[1]
and another 6,963 translators and boosters, which extend the reach
of existing stations.[2] In addition, computer technology has created
a multitude of interactive computer highways, such as the Internet.
 It is not as if consumers don't have enough access to information.
<P>
The basis for CPB's existence has always been an anti-free market
philosophy.   Proponents have said that the market is incapable
of providing good programming, so the government must step in
and do it, to the tune of $285.6 million annually.[3] This insults
the intelligence of the viewing/listening public, because it assumes
they won't appreciate or support good programming.  Yet the shows
that register high ratings on PBS turn out to be the very programs
that the public perceives to be excellent: <I>Sesame Street</I>,
<I>Barney and Friends</I>, <I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I>,
and <I>Masterpiece Theatre</I>, for example.  All of these shows
are generating more than sufficient revenue from sponsors, donors,
grants and product marketing.  They do not need taxpayer subsidies.
But there is other CPB programming that probably would fail to
attract a sufficient viewing/listening audience or donor support.
 These programs are so bad that their creators must dig into the
public purse.  Subsidizing bad art is a donor's prerogative, of
course -- unless the &quot;donor&quot; is the taxpayer, who has
no choice.  
<P>
In a time of massive federal deficits, it makes no sense to require
taxpayers to shell out their hard-earned dollars for art of any
kind.  And the CPB, like any government bureaucracy, has waste
built into it.  A Congressional Conference Report on the Public
Broadcasting Service discloses that &quot;a single individual
is paid $438,000 annually for his once a week 30 minute appearance.&quot;[4]
<P>
It also makes no sense when cable television and satellites are
providing hundreds of programming alternatives.  Anything that
is worth viewing on PBS, for instance, would be picked up by Bravo,
The Learning Channel, the Arts &amp; Entertainment Network and
other channels. 
<P>
Public broadcasting advocates acknowledge that major PBS and NPR
stations would continue to thrive without federal subsidies. 
Their concern, they say, is that smaller, rural stations would
be forced to close.  But rural radio listeners or TV viewers can
tune in to numerous commercial stations or even to National Public
Radio or Public Broadcasting Service stations in distant cities
merely by acquiring better equipment.  Would it really be a great
loss if rural folks were denied the ability to see <I>Tongues
Untied</I> on their own, local station? Living in the country
has its own rewards, but forcing other taxpayers to subsidize
money-losing operations and bad art should not be one of them.
<P>
Besides, there is no public clamor from rural people or suburbanites
or urban dwellers, for that matter, to continue to subsidize the
pet projects (and paychecks) of a small radical elite that is
at odds with most American values.  The case for CPB subsidies
is being made almost exclusively by those in &quot;the arts community&quot;
and radical political activists who stand to benefit directly
from taxpayer largesse.  A case in point is a recent letter from
Independent Television Service Executive Director James Yee to
public broadcasting advocates.  The taxpayer-supported (and, therefore,
in no way independent) ITVS was created in 1988 to provide new
programming for public broadcasting.  Yee urges his &quot;independent
colleagues&quot; to &quot;become involved in future efforts to
drum up support for public broadcasting, especially with your
local and national elected officials, local public broadcasting
station(s), media arts organizations, and civic and cultural institutions.&quot;[5]
Yee warned that &quot;an extensive informational outreach campaign
will have to be waged,&quot;[6] which means newspapers and broadcasters
will begin pelting their audiences with scary stories about the
demise of Big Bird, should budget cutters prevail.   
<P>
But the debate over CPB is not about grounding Big Bird.  Through
PBS and NPR, the CPB is peddling a political and social agenda
that is offensive to many.  For example, NPR reporter Sunni Khalid
revealed more than a bit of political bias when commenting on
the Republican Congressional victory during a C-Span <I>Journalists
Roundtable</I> (C-Span is not funded by CPB, but by America's
cable TV operators): &quot;I think there's a big difference when
people told Father Aristide to sort of moderate his views, they
were concerned about people being dragged through the streets,
killed and necklaced.  I don't think that is what [House Speaker]
Newt Gingrich has in mind.  I think he's looking at a more scientific,
a more civil way, of lynching people.&quot;[7]
<P>
The bright side is that few folks are tuning in to public broadcasting's
truly awful programs.   The bad side is that their money is being
used to produce shows that are used to validate attacks on them,
and then the same shows are foisted, in videocassettes, on unsuspecting
schoolchildren as &quot;educational&quot; supplements. 
<P>
Here are a few of the anti-family, anti-religious, pro-homosexual
offerings from public broadcasting in recent years:
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ANTI-FAMILY PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>In July 1994, a mother in Akron, Ohio, was shocked to find a
program titled <I>What if I'm Gay</I> sandwiched between <I>Kidsongs
TV</I> and <I>Sesame Street</I> from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m. on her
local PBS station.  The mother's concern about placing such programming
at a time when many pre-school children and toddlers are watching
T.V. seems to have been largely ignored by the station.  After
the woman called the station to complain, the programming director
defended the show, saying, &quot;The quality of the program is
unquestionable.  It has good
writing and production and is well thought out.&quot;[8]
<P>
<LI>The Independent Television Service (ITVS) has been awarded more
than $38 million in public broadcasting funds since 1989.  For
that princely sum, according to public media watchdog <I>COMINT</I>
magazine, the public has received a mere nine hours of programming.
Perhaps this is a blessing, given ITVS's focus.  One five-hour
series called <I>Television Families,</I> for which ITVS (through
the taxpayers) ponied up $1.9 million, plans to feature &quot;tales
of more or less dysfunctional families&quot; which &quot;all fall
outside the mainstream.&quot; ITVS earlier had announced that
it is seeking programs that will &quot;test the boundaries, both
of form and content, that have defined the family's role on television.&quot;
 These include &quot;new alternative households, new patterns
for adoption and birth...new articulations of rights for children.&quot;
<P>
The anti-family agenda in this case is obvious.  It incorporates
and goes beyond <I>Murphy Brown's</I> glorification of single
motherhood.  The term &quot;alternative households&quot; is often
used to describe homosexual households and other non-traditional
households, putting them on the same moral plane as traditional
families.  &quot;New patterns for adoption and birth&quot; are
terms used to describe adoption of children by homosexuals and
artificial insemination.  &quot;Children's rights&quot; is the
anti-parent philosophy in which the state knows best when it comes
to handing out condoms, referring children to abortionists and
otherwise undermining the authority of parents. 
<P>
Another ITVS offering is <I>Dottie Gets Spanked</I>, a mockery
of 1950s American family life from the producer of the cult homosexual
films <I>Superstar</I> and <I>Poison</I>.  Yet another is <I>Terminal
USA</I>, described by the ITVS newsletter <I>Buzzwords</I> as
being about &quot;wholly unwholesome folks&quot; who &quot;cram
a lot of skeletons in their closet: drug abuse, homosexuality,
teen pregnancy, elderly abuse, unemployment, and infidelity (with
the pizza delivery boy) -- all under one roof.&quot; Making a
gratuitous slam on conservative Christians, <I>Buzzwords</I> concludes:
&quot;Unlike the absolute 'family values' of censorship-minded
evangelicals, <I>TV Families</I> values all kinds of families.&quot;[9]
<P>
<LI>In May of 1992 PBS broadcast a documentary called <I>What Kids
Want to Know About Sex and Growing Up</I>.  Produced by the Children's
Television Workshop, the show was an attack on traditional family
values in the guise of a pseudo-scientific presentation. 
<P>
The program contains graphic sexual information, aimed at children
as young as 8 years old.  Children are encouraged to use condoms
without being informed about high condom failure rates.  Abstinence
is given only a passing mention.  Parents are nearly invisible,
as are clergy or any other adults who would normally articulate
moral and familial ramifications of sexuality. 
<P>
Having a baby is illustrated through an exercise in which teens
carry around a bag of flour for a week and then talk about how
it cramps their style.  This exercise fails to take into account
the joys of parenthood.  It dehumanizes babies and subordinates
life itself to the cold sexual imperative. 
<P>
None of the instructors use the word &quot;marriage&quot; in any
context.  Sex is portrayed strictly as a physical act, without
the larger moral and social contexts that constitute the real
&quot;facts of life.&quot;  &quot;Husbands&quot; and &quot;wives&quot;
are not mentioned, just &quot;partners.&quot; This video is now
available in commercial video stores.
<P>
<LI>Children's Television Workshop also publishes <I>Sesame Street
Parents</I> magazine, which features an advice column by New York
University psychologist Lawrence Balter.   In the January/February
1994 issue, Dr. Balter advises parents that masturbation is a
&quot;tension-relieving activity that, much like hair twirling
and thumb-sucking, serves to soothe and calm children.  Masturbation
can also help a child learn more about his body and help him develop
positive attitudes toward sex....Avoid telling your son that touching
himself is 'not nice.'&quot;[10]
<P>
<LI>In 1992, the POV (Point of View) series began with <I>Color
Adjustment</I>, a documentary by homosexual writer and AIDS victim,
the late Marlon Riggs (see <I>Tongues Untied</I> item below),
who complained about the heterosexual bias of most family programming:
&quot;Have we exchanged the myths of pre-television America for
new fictions just as confining, for impossibly rigid, homogenized
fictions of the family, and the American dream....?&quot;[11]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PRO-HOMOSEXUAL PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>On January 5, 1995, National Public Radio's &quot;All Things
Considered&quot; ran what amounted to a promotion of homosexual
punk rock music, focusing on the new activist group Homocore.
 NPR reporter Rick Carr describes New York's Pansy Division as
&quot;one of hundreds of bands that infuse punk rock's do-it-yourself
aesthetic with gay themes.&quot;[12] 
<P>
<LI>In early 1994, PBS ran the miniseries <I>Tales of the City</I>,
a celebration of homosexuality in San Francisco during the 1970s.
 The series presents the homosexual lifestyle as superior to marriage
and family, with few apparent consequences from promiscuous sex
or illicit drugs.  The series is full of gratuitous nudity, crudity,
lewdness and foul language.  Traditional families are lampooned
through stereotypical caricatures of stupid fathers and meddling
mothers.  The only person dying from an incurable disease is a
heterosexual businessman who winds up cheating on his wife with
a transsexual.  Even an edited version of the series that ran
on Oklahoma public television caused a &quot;quite a bit of animosity
amongst a considerable number of legislators from rural areas,&quot;
Bob Allen of Oklahoma ETV told <I>Current</I>, a public broadcasting
trade journal.[13] The publication noted that <I>Tales</I> had also
drawn acclaim from critics and &quot;just about everywhere, local
outlets heard both praise and disapproval from viewers.&quot;[14]
<P>
<LI>In 1991, PBS aired a film documentary titled <I>Tongues Untied</I>.
 Written by ITVS grant recipient Marlon Riggs and shown under
the banner of POV, the documentary was so offensive that more
than 100 PBS stations refused to air it.  Still, many urban stations
did air the show, which contained full frontal nudity, bare buttocks
and 20 seconds of two men disrobing and having sex.
<P>
<LI>In June of 1992, PBS aired <I>The Lost Language of Cranes</I>
as part of Gay Pride Month.  The film features a father and son
&quot;coming out,&quot;  to declare their homosexuality.  The
movie also shows a man attempting to initiate anonymous sex with
a man in a homosexual porn theater.  Graphic scenes of homosexuals
kissing and engaging in sex are also featured.
<P>
Homosexual activists have acknowledged CPB's contribution to their
cause.  At a public hearing on CPB held in Washington, D.C. in
January 1994, Cathy Renna of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation (GLAAD) congratulated CPB, which, she said, &quot;has
aired many documentaries, films, and series that have touched
on or dealt with gay issues.&quot; She urged CPB to &quot;continue
to bring as much gay-oriented programming as possible to the viewing
public without fear of reprisal or complaint.&quot;[15] At the same
hearing, Gregory King of the Human Rights Campaign Fund noted,
&quot;...the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, through your
support of National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service,
has had an important impact on the ability of lesbian and gay
Americans to emerge from the shadows of society into the sunlight
of American life.&quot;[16] He singled out NPR's <I>Morning Edition</I>,
<I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I> and the <I>Charlie Rose Show</I>,
which &quot;regularly include discussions with gay and lesbian
Americans on issues of public importance,&quot; and praised CPB
for its support of gay-themed programming, such as <I>In the Life</I>,
<I>The American Playhouse</I>, <I>Longtime Companion</I>, <I>Andre's
Mother</I>, <I>The AIDS Quarterly</I>, <I>The Lost Language of
Cranes</I>, <I>Silverlake Life: The View from Here</I> and Armistead
Maupin's <I>Tales of the City</I> for bringing &quot;gay and lesbian
concerns into the mainstream of American life, where they belong.&quot;[17]
<P>
What King failed to add is that these aforementioned programs
are loaded with homosexual activists' propaganda and ignore the
health consequences of homosexual behavior.  They also ignore
the existence of the burgeoning ex-gay movement, reserving that
topic for the smear show, <I>One Nation Under God</I>.  PBS' pro-homosexual
programs also typically screen out any knowledgeable opponents
of the gay rights movement. 
<P>
In closing, King urged CPB to &quot;continue to provide leadership
in using the airwaves...to break the bonds of bigotry.&quot;[18]
<P>
Speaking of bigotry, public broadcasting harbors the last respectable
form of bigotry in America: Christian bashing.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ANTI-RELIGIOUS PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>On September 6, 1993, National Public Radio's <I>All Things
Considered</I> chronicled a controversy in Colorado Springs. 
The story was about some parents who objected to their children
being baptized without their parents' knowledge during a local
church carnival.[19] The controversy was real, and the conflict compelling.
 However NPR's handling of the story was anything but evenhanded.
<P>
Opening remarks by the reporter implied that children are no longer
safe in Colorado Springs because of the presence of Christian
groups.  No spokesmen are included to combat the anonymous charge
that Colorado Springs is fraught with &quot;religious extremism.&quot;
 The story presented an organization named The Citizen's Project
as a &quot;liberal volunteer&quot; organization that promotes
communication and understanding between its members and conservative
Christians.  However, on another program aired on NPR, which was
also openly biased against Christians, the Citizen's Project is
described as a &quot;watchdog&quot; organization that gives citizens
a sense of belonging by &quot;organizing opposition to [the Christian]
agenda.&quot;
<P>
<LI>In October of 1993, NPR broadcast a documentary titled <I>The
Politics of Bigotry</I>.  Described as an &quot;in-depth investigation
of the Christian Right...,&quot; the show was actually an ugly
smear of Christians which violated the First Amendment protection
against infringement on the free exercise of religion.  
<P>
The two-and-a-half hour documentary contains many opinions presented
as if they were fact and gives Christians no opportunity to respond
to the majority of statements made by their detractors.
<P>
<LI>A segment of PBS's <I>Bill Moyers' Journal</I> titled <I>The
New Holy War</I>[20] was supposed to be a documentary about Colorado's
&quot;Amendment Two,&quot; a statewide ballot initiative which
would have prohibited political jurisdictions across the state
from granting special rights to homosexuals.  Instead it was an
anti-religious hit piece disguised as balanced journalism.  The
issue is framed in terms of a struggle between homosexuals, who
Moyers portrays as oppressed victims fighting for their rights,
and Evangelical Christians, who are pictured as intolerant bigots.
<P>
Moyers works hard to pass himself off as an objective journalist.
 However, he reveals his bias when he conducts an in-depth critical
look at an organization supporting Amendment Two without so much
as mentioning any one of the several organizations fighting against
it.  Also, Moyers fails to inform viewers of vote totals, the
percentage of evangelical Christians in the state, or that many
non-evangelicals supported Amendment Two.  Moyers charges, but
fails to present any evidence, that the conflict was strictly
between homosexuals and Christians.[21]
<P>
Moyers' greatest omission was his failure to present an accurate
portrayal of the homosexual lifestyle.  The show features male
and female homosexual couples who are clean cut, monogamous and
well-spoken.  While this image may be true of the couples featured
on the show, it is in sharp contrast with what the research tells
us about the homosexual lifestyle.  Research shows that male homosexuals
typically are quite promiscuous, with many sexual partners over
the course of a lifetime.  In addition, homosexuals are at high
risk for a host of sexually transmitted diseases and violence
within relationships.  Homosexual males typically and tragically
have shorter lifespans.[22]  Homosexuals are also more likely to have
drug and alcohol abuse problems.[23]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>RADICAL POLITICAL PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Ultra-left <I>Pacifica</I> radio, along with PBS's <I>Frontline</I>,
<I>Point of View</I> and dozens of PBS specials, have been criticized
for left-wing bias.  Some recent examples:
<P>
<UL><LI> In 1992, KPFK, the <I>Pacifica</I> station in Los Angeles, broadcast
an <I>African Mental Liberation Weekend</I>.  The 26-hour marathon
of speeches and interviews was called a &quot;hatefeast&quot;
by members of the L.A. Jewish community.[24] Speakers included Louis
Farrakhan, who said that whites and Jews were &quot;the pale horse
with death its rider and hell close behind.&quot;[25] The broadcast
also featured black supremacist Leonard Jeffries lecturing on
Jewish involvement in the slave trade and Steve Cokely, who evoked
a &quot;Jew doctors conspiracy to infect black children with AIDS.&quot;[26]
<P>
<LI>In May 1994, NPR announced plans to run prison-life commentaries
by convicted cop-killer and former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal,
claiming that the show would bring a &quot;unique perspective
to listeners.&quot;[27] Although the show was canceled after Sen.
Robert Dole took to the Senate floor to decry CPB's lack of balance,
the incident raised serious questions about CPB's judgment and
commitment to balanced programming. 
<P>
<LI>Several specials have been broadcast which support totalitarian
and anti-American causes.  For example: <I>Maria's Story</I>,
a show about the war in El Salvador from the communist FMLN's
perspective and <I>Cuba in the Shadow of Doubt</I>, which was
described by a <I>New York Times</I> critic as having &quot;...a
romantic infatuation with Cuba.&quot;[28] Another example is a PBS
documentary on families divided over the Castro regime entitled
<I>Miami-Havana</I>.  The credits of the film contain a &quot;special
thanks&quot; to the Combinado del Este prison.  According to Alberto
Mora, a Cuban-American lawyer, &quot;no prison has a grislier
reputation than Combinado del Este.  Mind you, this notoriety
stands out even in the context of a prison system infamous for
its barbarism.&quot;[29]
<P></UL>
<CENTER><H3>NO NEED FOR SUBSIDIES</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In a truly free broadcasting market, programs of very limited
appeal would most likely not garner advertising support.  They
would be confined to media that are supported by those who seek
this information.  Left-leaning foundations and individual donors
might be persuaded to fund them, but they have little incentive
to do so while it is so easy to tap the taxpayers.
<P>
The programs mentioned above are not the examples that CPB supporters
cite when they complain that good programming would be lost without
CPB.  Instead, CPB advocates point to popular shows such as <I>Sesame
Street</I> and <I>The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour</I>.  They fail
to mention that the popular shows will fare well in free market
competition.  Children's Television Workshop, parent company of
<I>Sesame Street</I>, has a stock and bond portfolio worth more
than $51 million.[30] And gross merchandising sales of Sesame Street
items rack up $1 billion annually, earning CTW about $100 million
in royalties.[31] One divisional CTW president had an annual salary,
including bonuses, of $625,000.[32] 
<P>
CPB funding makes up only 14 percent of public broadcasting's
total budget.[33] Federal grants from other agencies, such as the
National Endowment for the Arts, make up another 5 percent.  The
rest comes from donors, businesses, foundations, state governments,
public colleges and universities, auction participants and private
colleges and universities.  All told, 49 percent of public broadcasting's
budget comes from taxpayers at all levels, but the direct federal
component makes up only 19 percent.[34]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Pulling CPB's tax-funded plug would force producers to take into
account the tastes of their audiences and would motivate public
broadcasters to look to their lucrative offspring, like Barney
or Bill Moyers, to contribute more to the collective coffers.
 The result? Good programming would continue to thrive, and the
offensive and meritless programs would likely go the way of that
other big bird, the dodo.  
<P>
It's time to zero-budget the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
 Big Bird should leave the nest of Big Government and fly on his
own.

<H2>SUFFER THE CHILDREN:<BR>
TITLE X's FAMILY PLANNING FAILURE</H2>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<I>by </I>
<P>
<I>Gracie S. Hsu</I></CENTER>
<P>
Title X of the Public Health Service Act is a categorical grant
issued by the federal government to fund family planning projects
throughout the United States.  Enacted in 1970, Title X was supposed
to help reduce the unplanned pregnancy rate, especially in the
teenager population.  However, Title X has not only failed to
reduce the teenage pregnancy rate, but teenage reproductive health
has drastically worsened in every category.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>TITLE X'S IMPACT ON TEENAGE HEALTH</H3></CENTER> 
<P>
Over the lifetime of Title X, the number of teenage clients has
grown due to increases in both Title X funding and the overall
number of enrollees in Title X clinics.  Currently, an estimated
1.5 million Title X clients are teenagers, constituting approximately
one-third of the program's total clientele.  But even though more
teenagers are being exposed to these family planning &quot;services,&quot;
the rates of out-of-wedlock births, abortions, sexually-transmitted
diseases, and pregnancies have all risen significantly in the
teenage population since the program's inception.
<P><UL>
<LI><B>Out-of-wedlock births -- <I>Since the introduction
of Title X, the teenage out-of-wedlock birth rate has doubled.</B></I>
 The out-of-wedlock birth rate per 1,000 unmarried girls aged
15-19 rose from 22.4 in 1970 to 44.6 in 1992 (teen births have
declined since 1992).
<P>
This illegitimacy figure is especially important to note because
Title X advocates have sought to claim &quot;success&quot; by
pointing out that the overall teenage birth rate has declined.
 However, such a decline is only attributable to the decline in
<I>marital</I> births, <I>not</I> in illegitimate births.  In
1970, seventy percent of teenage births were marital; in 1991,
7 in 10 teenage births occurred <I>outside</I> marriage.
<P>
The same trend toward out-of-wedlock childbearing is evidenced
in the female population at large.  In 1970 when Title X began,
children living with one parent were more than four times as likely
to be products of divorce as they were to have been born out-of-wedlock.
 But by 1993, the Census Bureau reports found that American children
who live with one parent were almost equally divided between children
of divorce and those born to unmarried parents.
<P>
<LI><B>Abortions -- <I>Over the lifetime of Title X, the
teenage abortion rate has more than doubled.</B></I>  In 1972,
the abortion rate per 1,000 girls aged 15-19 was 19.1; in 1990,
the rate was 40.6.  While the abortion rate grew rapidly from
1972 to the early 1980s, the rate has apparently reached a plateau,
hovering between 40 and 43 abortions per 1,000 teenage girls over
the last 10 years.
<P>
While the rapid growth of the teenage abortion rate during the
early years of Title X is no doubt attributable, in large measure,
to the <I>Roe v. Wade</I> decision, the past decade's more stabilized
abortion rate cannot be viewed optimistically.  For during this
time, a rapid rise also occurred in out-of-wedlock births.
<P>
Interestingly, the women whom Title X clinics target -- low-income
women, minorities, and unmarried young people -- have the highest
abortion rates.  And, the Alan Guttmacher Institute reports that
half of all women having an abortion used a contraceptive method
in the month during which they conceived.
<P>
<LI><B>Sexually-Transmitted Diseases (STDs) -- <I>Sexually-transmitted
diseases among teenagers have increased dramatically despite the
fact that many Title X clinics provide both contraception and
STD screening.  In fact, teenagers now have higher rates of gonorrhea
than any other 5-year age group between 20 and 44.</B></I>  Currently,
one in four sexually experienced teenagers -- about 3 million
-- become infected with an STD every year.
<P>
For the first time ever, teenage girls have the highest gonorrhea
rates in the nation; teenage boys rank second.  The rate in adolescent
girls is 20 times higher than in women over 30, according to the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Infectious
syphilis rates more than doubled among teenagers since the mid-1980s.
 Additionally, up to 15 percent of sexually experienced teenage
girls are infected with human papilloma virus, many of them carrying
a strain that can cause cervical cancer.  Chlamydia also has spread
explosively, currently infecting 22 percent of sexually active
girls and 10 percent of sexually active boys.  Finally, one in
five reported full-blown AIDS cases is diagnosed among people
in their 20s.  Due to the virus' long incubation period (about
10 years), most were adolescents when they were infected, according
to the CDC.
<P>
Sexually-transmitted diseases can lead to cancer, pelvic inflammatory
disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and/or even death.  Estimates
from the general population indicate that between 100,000 and
150,000 women become infertile each year as a result of an STD,
and about 15 to 30 percent of the 2.3 million U.S. couples who
are infertile may be unable to conceive as a result of an STD.
 But beyond infertility, STDs also increase the likelihood of
contracting HIV.  According to some estimates, having an STD,
such as gonorrhea, increases by as much as 100 times the chance
of contracting HIV from an infected partner.
<P>
<LI><B>Pregnancies -- <I>Since the introduction of Title
X, the out-of-wedlock pregnancy rate among 15-to 19-year-old girls
has doubled.</B></I>  In the same time span, the <I>overall</I>
teenage pregnancy rate (marital and nonmarital) increased 23 percent,
climbing from 95.1 per 1,000 girls aged 15-19 in 1972 to 117.1
in 1990.  So not only did the overall teenage pregnancy rate increase,
but a greater proportion of these pregnancies are now out-of-wedlock.
 This trend is best evidenced by the growing rate of out-of-wedlock
births.  When Title X began, only 3 in 10 teen births were out-of-wedlock;
now 7 in 10 teen births occur outside marriage.
<P>
Despite the 23 percent increase in the overall teen pregnancy
rate, Title X advocates still claim &quot;success&quot; by stating
that &quot;fewer sexually experienced teenagers become pregnant
each year.&quot;  Advocates often remark that the pregnancy rate
among sexually experienced teenagers has decreased from 254 to
207 per 1,000 (19%) in the last two decades.  However, this figure
is derived from a statistical invention called the &quot;sexually
experienced teenage pregnancy rate&quot; (SETPR) which obscures
the disastrous changes in teenage sexual activity and ignores
the real indices of social health, i.e., the rates of teenage
pregnancy, abortion, out-of-wedlock births, and STDs.  The fact
is, a greater proportion of teenagers are sexually experienced
today than 20 years ago.
<P>
Consider the following hypothetical comparison of two nations,
Country A and Country B:
<p><pre><center>
<B>Country    # of teenage     # sexually     # pregnant    SETPR
          girls 15-19      active         annually           </B>
<P>
  A        1,000,000        500,000       200,000       400
  B        1,000,000        100,000       50,000        500
</center></pre><p>
In this straightforward example, Country B has a 25% higher &quot;sexually
experienced teenage pregnancy rate&quot; than Country A.  But
Country B has only one-fifth the sexual activity rate of Country
A and one-fourth of its teenage pregnancy rate.  In fact, it is
obvious that Country A can have a lower SETPR than Country B while
still having a higher sexual activity rate, a higher rate of STDs,
a higher number of pregnancies, and both four times as many abortions
and out-of-wedlock births as Country B!  SETPR may be of some
statistical interest at the margin, but as a measure of adolescent
well-being it is not merely useless, but grossly misleading.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>TITLE X FUNDING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
By all accounts, teenage reproductive health has suffered under
Title X's watch.  Yet, incredibly, Title X programs continue to
receive <I>increased</I> government funding, currently reaching
an all-time high of $193 million for fiscal year 1995.  Why? 
Because there is <I>no</I> <I>accountability</I> or measure of
effectiveness connected to the funding of the program.  There
has never been an evaluation component included in the grants;
and in 1983, the Department of Health and Human Services discontinued
collecting client data.
<P>
The federal government is not only funding a failed program, it
is funding an <I>unauthorized</I> program.  Title X's funding
authorization officially expired in 1985, but the program continues
to receive federal dollars every year through inclusion in the
Labor/Health and Human Services Appropriations bill.
<P>
<B>PROHIBITION OF ABORTION</B> -- Section 1008 of Title X states
that &quot;none of the funds appropriated under this title shall
be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.&quot;
 Yet many of the clinics which receive Title X funds perform abortions
in addition to providing other family planning services.  These
clinics creatively &quot;obey&quot; the prohibition by maintaining
separate budgets for abortion and family planning.  However, when
self-titled &quot;family planning&quot; clinics perform abortions
and refer clients for abortion when contraception fails, an implicit
assumption exists that abortion is indeed a method of family planning.
 Additionally, many Planned Parenthood (PP) clinics receive Title
X funds.  And while not all of these PP clinics perform abortions,
Planned Parenthood's reputation as an abortion provider is undisputable.
 Thus, to the client, no relevant distinction is made between
abortion and family planning; in fact, the prohibition has been
reduced to a mere bookkeeping formality.  Such a misuse of the
statute must be immediately halted and the integrity of the prohibition's
original intent restored.
<P>
<CENTER> <H3>TEENAGE SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND CONTRACEPTIVE USE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Poor teenage reproductive health outcomes and Title X funding
are clearly correlated.  But the question that begs to be answered
is, &quot;What accounts for the correlation?  What effect do contraceptive
counseling and dispensing have on teenagers' sexual behavior?&quot;
 While such questions cannot be answered easily, there are clues
which point in a common direction.
<UL><P>
<LI>Sexual activity rates among teenagers are higher now than ever
before.  Currently, fifty-six percent of girls and 73 percent
of boys have intercourse before age 18, compared to 35 percent
and 55 percent in the early 1970s.
<P>
<LI>A 1993 <I>Public Health Reports</I> article found that adolescent
males who had been instructed in sexual biology and birth control
were at a higher risk of early first intercourse than were those
who had received no instruction.
<P>
<LI>Research from Planned Parenthood shows that the number one reason,
by far, that teenagers initiate sexual activity is peer pressure.
 By promoting contraceptive use among teenagers, Title X clinics
reduce the number of outside forces bolstering teenagers' resolve
to save sex for marriage.
</UL><P>
<B>MULTIPLE PARTNERS</B> -- According to the Centers for Disease
Control, &quot;The initiation of sexual intercourse early in life
is associated with an increased number of sex partners and a greater
risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).&quot;  Data show
that one-half of sexually experienced teenage girls wait almost
18 months between first intercourse and having sex with a second
sexual partner; another one-fourth wait almost 2 years.  Thus,
helping teenagers to delay sex initiation is especially important.
<P>
However, evidence also indicates that <I>contraceptive use leads
to increased sexual activity, with a greater number of partners.</I>
 Consequently, the dispensing of prescription contraceptives without
parental involvement by family planning clinics would serve to
exacerbate this trend -- which is, in fact, what is happening
today.
<UL><P>
<LI>Among sexually active girls aged 15-17, 55 percent have had
2 or more partners and 13 percent have had at least 6.
<P>
<LI>Between 1971 and 1988, the percentage of sexually experienced
women aged 15-19 living in urban areas who reported 4 or more
sex partners increased from 14% to 31%.
<P>
<LI>Forty-five percent of 15-24-year-olds who had initiated sexual
intercourse before age 18 reported having had four or more partners;
75 percent reported having had two or more partners.
<P>
<LI>Dr. Robert Kistner of Harvard Medical School, one of the developers
of the oral contraceptive, subsequently acknowledged that use
of contraceptives among teenagers is stimulating higher levels
of promiscuity:  &quot;About ten years ago I declared that the
pill would not lead to promiscuity.  Well, I was wrong,&quot;
he said (<I>Family Practice News</I>, 1977).
</UL><P>
<B>CONTRACEPTIVE FAILURE</B> -- Not only does contraceptive use
lead to increased sexual activity with a greater number of partners,
but contraception is not terribly effective at protecting teenagers
from unplanned pregnancy and/or STD infection.  Indeed, one-third
of teenage pregnancies occur <I>while a contraceptive is being
used</I>, and this figure does not even take into account the
STD transmission rate.
<P>
In part, this is due to the fact that no contraceptive method
is highly effective in protecting simultaneously against pregnancy
and infection.  Contraceptives with the best record for reducing
pregnancy risk offer little, if any, protection against STDs.
 On the other hand, condoms have a standardized failure rate of
15.7 percent at preventing <I>pregnancy</I> over the course of
a year; in teenagers, the rate is even higher.  In addition to
a poor contraceptive record, condoms have not been shown to be
effective at protecting women against STD infection.  A recent
<I>Family Planning Perspectives</I> article found that condoms
may protect women against some STDs, but the data are equivocal.
 In several studies, condoms showed no protective effect against
cervical human papilloma virus, chlamydia, or bacterial vaginosis
in women.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MATERNAL AND INFANT MORTALITY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Maternal and infant mortality might not seem, at first glance,
to be related to a discussion of Title X's impact on teenagers;
but, in reality, the two concepts are inextricably connected.
 Title X's mandate is to reduce maternal and infant mortality
and to promote the health of mothers and children.  However, Title
X has miserably failed in fulfilling this mandate.  America ranks
24th in the world in infant survival, a very low ranking for a
developed country, let alone the wealthiest country in the world.
 And the problems associated with Title X -- out-of-wedlock births,
teenage pregnancies, and STDs -- are major factors undermining
maternal and infant health.
<UL><P>
<LI><B>Out-of-wedlock births</B> -- Nicholas Eberstadt and others
have shown that marital status at birth is the key indicator for
infant mortality, transcending both ethnicity and poverty.  And
the out-of-wedlock teenage birth rate has soared under Title X's
watch.
<P>
<LI><B>Teenage pregnancy</B> -- One major cause of infant mortality
is low birth weight, which is directly related to teenage pregnancy.
 Thus it comes as no surprise that Title X's failure to reduce
teenage pregnancy would also result in higher infant mortality.
<P>
<LI><B>Sexually-transmitted diseases</B> -- As was discussed earlier,
STDs have a negative impact on women's health, possibly leading
to cancer, infertility, and even death.  Ectopic pregnancies,
which can be caused by STDs, have quadrupled since 1970, and the
rate of infertility among women has also dramatically increased.
 But in addition to women, STDs hurt infants.  The infection of
infants from the mother's STDs (including, but not limited to
HIV) has become a significant problem and will only continue to
worsen as nonmarital sexual activity remains unchecked.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>FRC RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING TITLE X</CENTER></H3>
<P>
<B>(1)</B>  <B>Remove all funding from Title X</B> -- Title X
has not only failed to reduce the rates of teenage pregnancy,
out-of-wedlock births, and sexually-transmitted diseases, it has
exacerbated these problems.  The program's lack of evaluation
criteria and its approach as an open-ended project grant have
frustrated accountability.
<P>
Title X does not deserve to continue receiving taxpayer dollars
and, in fact, <I>should</I> not be receiving federal dollars,
as an unauthorized program.  The federal government has a responsibility
to use federal funds wisely, and it should not be funding programs
which, by all accounts, have produced worsened health outcomes.
<P>
<B>(2)</B>  <B>If Title X comes up for reauthorization, do not
reauthorize</B> -- Title X's authorization expired in 1985.  And
Title X should remain unauthorized because it has never been shown
to benefit the American public.

<B>(3)</B>  <B>Promote saving sex for the context of marriage</B>
-- If the federal government must play a role in &quot;family
planning,&quot; it ought to promote the optimum health message
-- that sex should be saved for marriage.  Research shows that
people who postpone sexual activity until marriage and practice
monogamy within marriage are more likely to be sexually satisfied,
to have enduring marriages, and to be free from the ravages of
out-of-wedlock pregnancies and sexually-transmitted diseases.

<P>
Adoption is a good choice and sound policy.  And now it is finally
receiving some well-deserved attention by Congress.  Under consideration
are two laudable reform proposals which would make it easier for
more people to choose adoption.
<P>
(1) <B>Reducing financial obstacles</B> -- The House GOP's Contract
with America includes the Family Reinforcement Act, of which adoption
assistance is a primary component.  This proposal would make adoption
a more affordable choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing
a tax credit of up to $5,000 for qualified adoption expenses.
 These expenses could include adoption fees, court costs, attorney
fees, and other expenses which are directly related to the legal
adoption of the child.  Appropriately, the legislation explicitly
excludes payments to surrogate mothers and to individuals adopting
their spouse's children.
<P>
(2) <B>Reducing legal (and psychological) barriers -- </B>As
a proposed amendment to the welfare reform bill, the National
Council for Adoption has suggested that unmarried mothers who
place their babies for adoption should be exempted from provisions
which require welfare recipients to identify the father of the
child as a condition of receiving assistance.  The proposal recognizes
paternal rights by giving fathers a period of up to thirty days
after the child's birth to come forward and claim custody of the
child.  Should the father fail to do so, his rights would be terminated,
and the child would be eligible for adoption.  This proposal should
be reviewed as a possible alternative to single parenthood that
increases the incentive for unwed mothers to choose adoption.
<P>
These proposals are laudable because they encourage adoption --
a beneficial option for the birthmother, the adopted child, and
the adoptive parents.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>BENEFITS OF ADOPTION FOR THE CHILD</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Adoption holds many benefits for the child involved.  Recently,
the Search Institute conducted the largest U.S. study of adopted
adolescents and their families to evaluate the mental health of
these adolescents at a time when they are forming their identities.
 This study, combined with other research, found that adopted
adolescents reap the following benefits:
<P>
<UL><LI><B>A Loving, Intact Family</B> -- Ninety percent of adopted
children live with married parents, and these families exhibit
high levels of warmth, communication, discipline, and cohesion.
 Indeed, the Search Institute's representative sample found that
only 11 percent of adopted adolescents report divorce or separation
compared to 28 percent in a national survey of adolescents.
<P>
<LI><B>Deep Child-Parent Attachment</B> -- Adopted adolescents
are as deeply attached to their parents as are their non-adopted
siblings.  Fifty-four percent report strong attachment to both
parents; another 30 percent are deeply attached to one parent.
 Equally compelling is the fact that 95 percent of parents experience
strong attachment to their adopted child.
<P>
<LI><B>Strong Self-Identity</B> -- Most adopted adolescents have
a strong self-identity, exhibiting higher levels of self-esteem
than their peers.  They accept their adoptive status with relative
ease and are as likely to report a positive self-identity as their
non-adopted siblings.
<P>
<LI><B>Positive Psychological Health</B> -- Based on multiple
indices of psychological health, the study found that at least
three-quarters of adopted adolescents are within the zone of positive
psychological health, even surpassing a comparison sample of public
school adolescents on several measures.
<P>
<LI><B>Financial Provision</B> -- Fifty-four percent of adopted
children live in homes with family income three times higher than
poverty level.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>BENEFITS OF ADOPTION FOR THE SINGLE MOTHER</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Research shows that young, unmarried women who choose adoption
for their babies reap many personal benefits.  Comparing favorably
to their counterparts, who choose single parenthood, women who
choose adoption exhibit the following characteristics.  They are:
<P>
<UL><LI>More likely to complete high school and advance further educationally.
<LI>More likely to be employed and have a higher income.
<LI>Less likely to live in poverty.
<LI>Less likely to receive public assistance than birth mothers
who chose to parent out-of-wedlock.  In fact, 60 percent of welfare
recipients are, or were at one time, teenage mothers.
<LI>More likely to marry subsequently.
<LI><B>Less likely to have a repeat out-of-wedlock pregnancy</B>
than the teenagers who choose parenting or abortion.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>THE NEED FOR ADOPTION POLICY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Adoption provides children with the benefits of solid, two-parent
homes while giving birthmothers the opportunity to mature before
taking on the adult responsibilities of childrearing.  That policy
should encourage adoption as a positive alternative for women
facing crisis pregnancies seems especially prudent during this
time when our nation's rates of out-of-wedlock pregnancy, abortion,
and single parenthood are skyrocketing.
<P>
<UL><LI><B>Illegitimacy</B> -- Births to unmarried teenagers continue
to escalate dramatically.  In 1992, there were 365,000 out-of-wedlock
teenage births -- a six-fold increase since 1950.  But even in
the population at large (not limited to teenagers), illegitimacy
is rampant.  Thirty percent of all our nation's children were
born to unwed mothers in 1991; in the black community, the figure
was an astounding 68 percent.
<P>
<LI><B>Single Parenthood</B> -- The number of children being raised
in single-parent homes is rapidly rising.  In 1970, 7.5 million
children lived in single, female-headed homes; by 1993, the figure
had more than doubled to 15.6 million.  In fact, over 27 percent
of all children under 18 live in single-parent homes (1993).
<P>
<LI><B>Abortion</B> -- Abortion is strongly linked to unwed pregnancy.
 Indeed, unmarried mothers account for 70 to 80 percent of the
1.5 million abortions performed on U.S. women; 406,000 abortions
were obtained by teenagers in 1992.  Thus, helping to make adoption
a more viable option could mean (1) fewer abortions, including
repeat abortions, and (2) many women being spared from experiencing
the trauma of post-abortion syndrome.
<P>
<LI><B>Poverty</B> -- Regardless of race or socioeconomic background,
a high correlation exists between single parenthood and poverty.
 Of all children under age 6 living in poverty, 61 percent are
from single-parent families (1992).  In fact, children under age
6 from single-parent households are more likely to live in poverty
than not.
<P>
<LI><B>Breaking the cycle</B> -- For the child of a single parent,
the statistical odds of becoming an unwed mother later in life,
or fathering a child out-of-wedlock, are staggering.  One study
found that 80 percent of the girls who were mothers at 15 were
themselves daughters of teenage mothers.  Adoption can help break
that cycle.
</UL><P>
The American public overwhelmingly supports adoption policy. 
A recent Family Research Council survey of 1,000 Americans found
that, by a margin of 3-to-1, respondents favor efforts &quot;to
make it easier for children born out-of-wedlock to be adopted.&quot;
 And when presented with four options to resolve out-of-wedlock
teenage pregnancies, 33 percent of respondents thought it best
to &quot;have the child and put it up for adoption;&quot; 25 percent
thought it best for the mother &quot;to marry the child's father
and have the child;&quot; 13 percent thought it best for the mother
&quot;to have the child and raise it by herself;&quot; and only
10 percent thought it best for her to have an abortion.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE CURRENT STATUS OF ADOPTION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Even though most people agree that adoption is a good choice,
few exercise that option.  Only 6 percent of all teenage mothers
choose adoption for their babies; in the black community, adoption
accounts for less than one percent.  So while the number of potentially
adoptable children is theoretically large due to the high numbers
of out-of-wedlock births and crisis pregnancies, there remains,
ironically, a shortage of children.  An estimated one to two million
prospective parents are <I>still waiting to adopt a child</I>.
<P>
Perhaps one of the reasons why so few unwed mothers choose adoption
for their babies is that adoption frequently is not presented
to women as a viable choice.  One study found that nearly 40 percent
of pregnancy counselors fail to include adoption as an option
in their counseling.  Even worse, the counselors had a 40 percent
rate of uncertainty and inaccurate knowledge about adoption. 
Incredibly, some pregnancy counselors who thought adoption would
be a good choice still failed to present it as an option, because
they thought the girls would not want to hear about it.
<P>
Consequently, the number of adoptions reflects the lack of attention
adoption has received.  The latest available data show that 51,157
unrelated adoptions (adoptions by people not related to the child
by blood or marriage) of American children occurred in 1986. 
Of these 51,000-plus domestic adoptions, approximately one-half
were adoptions of healthy infants (under 2 years of age) of all
races and ethnic backgrounds.  The remaining adoptions were of
older kids or of children with special needs, i.e., physical,
mental, or emotional disabilities, part of a sibling group, etc.
<P>
In addition to the adoption of American children, there were 10,097
foreign-born children adopted by Americans in 1987.  However,
due to a decrease in the number of adoptions of South Korean children,
this figure has since declined to an estimated 6,500 adoptions

<CENTER><H3>FURTHER POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Because of adoption's many benefits for both mother and child,
enabling more women to choose adoption should be a policy priority.
 Thus, in addition to the two proposals discussed earlier, the
Family Research Council recommends the following measures to make
the promotion of adoption more comprehensive.
<P>
(1)  Protocol for counseling women in crisis pregnancies should
include presentation of the adoption choice and its manifold benefits.
 This protocol should be used by counselors regardless of their
place of employment, i.e., crisis pregnancy centers, public health
facilities, and abortion clinics.  Inherent in this recommendation
is the expectation that such counselors would be properly trained
and adequately informed about the adoption option.  Furthermore,
the development of maternity homes should also be encouraged as
a way to promote adoption, as such homes have higher rates of
relinquishment than do other facilities.
<P>
(2)  The Department of Health and Human Services should collect
data on all adoptions, both public and private.  Currently, the
federal government only tracks adoption through the public system,
and the data available on the private sector is both limited and
outdated.  Data collection would also be enhanced through the
use of uniform data collection measures in each of the states.
 In addition to tracking the number of adoptions, the federal
government should encourage social science research regarding
adoption's impact on adopted children, birthmothers, and adoptive
parents.  This would not only add to the slim body of knowledge
already existing, it would also heighten awareness of the adoption
choice.
<P>
(3)  Reduce the barriers for prospective parents to choose adoption.
 This would include removing the obstacles hindering transracial
adoptions, reforming the insurance code to guarantee coverage
for adopted special-needs children, and speeding up the process
by which foster children could be adopted.

<P>
The American Psychiatric Association is a leading private, clinical
professional organization.  Over the years, the APA increasingly
has promoted greater acceptance of homosexuality.  And now, some
APA members are trying to outlaw counseling to homosexuals who
desire to change their orientation.
<P>
The association's pro-homosexual position is not shared by some
of its own members, and it offends many people of faith.  For
example, APA member Dr. Roy H. Hart writes from a Jewish perspective
in <I>Psychiatric News</I> that organized psychiatry does not
choose to understand religion's aversion to homosexuality.  He
writes in the May 1994 edition, &quot;Americans have the highest
rate of church attendance and membership in the Christian world,
but psychiatrists contribute little to those statistics.  What
is ego-alien for the psychiatrist -- religion -- is the center
of existence for a vast segment of the population.&quot;[1]
<P>
APA President John McIntyre tried to bridge the chasm with religion
when, after a pilgrimage to the epicenter of Mormonism, Salt Lake
City, he commented on the &quot;improved dialogue between religion
and psychiatry.&quot;[2]
<P>
The bridge McIntyre began to build in 1994 is now crumbling with
the advent of the January 1995 issue of the <I>American Journal
of Psychiatry</I>, the APA's official publication.  That issue
contains an article by Franklin D. Jones and Ronald J. Koshes,
&quot;Homosexuality and the Military&quot; which adds salt to
an old wound.[3] The article is noteworthy for its poor review of
research.  Its quick initial turn-around along with its array
of revisions suggests that the <I>AJP</I> editorial staff ignored
normal review procedures in order to publish a politicized article.

<CENTER><H3>"HOMOSEXUALITY AND THE MILITARY"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>1. Underwent an unusual review process.</B>  The article
was received by the <I>AJP</I> staff on July 14, 1993.[4] It was
subsequently revised four times before it was accepted June 17,
1994.[5] The first revision was received within four months, a very
brief time for this internationally recognized journal.  Following
the initial review there were at least three more revisions, suggesting
an unusual review process -- more like a dialogue than a peer-review
process.  In typical peer review, one or at most two revisions
are allowed. 
<P>
<B>2. Misrepresents the history of the military's homosexual
policy.</B>  The authors claim that the Pentagon's policy was
first formalized in 1982, and that the ban dates back to World
War II.[6] But the policy was formalized by President Carter and
became effective on January 16, 1981.  It was revised and updated
January 28, 1982.
<P>
The military's homosexual policy dates back to the British Articles
of War in 1775.  An individual was drummed out of the Continental
Army for attempted sodomy in 1778.[7] Prior to WW II, the legal
construction of the Articles of War and Army regulations were
broader in nature than today's.  Homosexual misconduct was prosecuted
under the categories of &quot;conduct unbecoming an officer&quot;
or, for enlisted members, &quot;conduct to the prejudice of good
order and military discipline.&quot;  After 1900, individuals
were punished for committing homosexual acts, which were lumped
under the rubric of sodomy.[8]
<P>
A WW I War Department circular, signed by the Surgeon General
in 1917, listed homosexuality as cause for rejection under the
category of &quot;psychopathic&quot; characteristics.[9] The 1921
enlistment standards included an implied homosexual policy excluding
people thought to be homosexual.[10] The right to make decisions
concerning the retention of enlisted men was delegated to relatively
low levels.  Discharges for &quot;inaptness or undesirable habits
or traits of character&quot; were handled under Section 8, Army
Regulation 615-360.[11]
<P>
The War Department's 1941 policy, which was harsher than previous
ones, emphasized that homosexual &quot;sodomists&quot; would not
be discharged but court-martialed.[12] Despite this increased penalty,
during the war there was an unofficial toleration of some homosexuals
because replacements were not guaranteed.  The policy was revised
in May, 1947 and, again, in 1949 to mandate that &quot;[h]omosexual
personnel, irrespective of sex, should not be permitted to serve
in any branch of the Armed Forces in any capacity, and prompt
separation of known homosexuals from the Armed Forces is mandatory.&quot;[13]
<P>
This fundamental was added to the Uniform Code of Military Justice
in 1951 with Articles 125 (act of sodomy) and 134 (assault). 
In September, 1958, Class III homosexuals (those who had committed
no homosexual act while in the military service) were furnished
honorable or general discharges based on the character of their
service.[14]
<P>
In the late 1970s, the Report of the Joint Service Administrative
Discharge Study Group recommended that the military reaffirm the
longstanding ban (indeed, it was more than 200 years old) on homosexuals
by incorporating into the policy the principled phrase, &quot;homosexuality
is incompatible with military service.&quot;  It also called for
the phrase, &quot;processing (for separation) is mandatory unless...the
allegations are groundless,&quot; to be included in all subsequent
Department of Defense (DoD) directives.  It also recommended some
leniency in cases of &quot;unsuitability,&quot; i.e., those involved
in homosexual tendencies or acts between consenting adults would
be honorably discharged.[15]
<P>
The 1982 policy cited in the <I>AJP</I> article incorporates the
aforementioned recommendations but was first published during
the last days of President Carter's administration.  That policy
was replaced by a law signed by President Clinton on November
30, 1993.  The Pentagon published implementing regulations on
February 28, 1994.
<P>
<B>3. Misrepresents the homosexual discharge history</B>.
 The authors cite homosexual discharge numbers and costs from
a discredited 1992 General Accounting Office study.[16] Other studies
show that the GAO underestimated the scope of homosexual discharges
and overestimated the costs to the government.
<P>
The GAO report stated that it costs the government $27 million
annually to discharge homosexuals.  But that figure is misleading.
 The military has a fixed number of authorized personnel, established
by Congress.  The projected annual number of enlistments is directly
related to the projected number of losses to achieve the established
end strength.  The cost to train new service members and to separate
other members is determined from the projected number of enlistments
and losses.  Those are sunk costs tied to running the training
base and a change of a few percent is of no real financial consequence.
<P>
Given the size of the military, the number of homosexuals discharged
is small.  For example, from 1980 through 1991, a total of 8,427,872
people served in the military.  During that same period there
were 17,840 non-judicial administrative discharges for homosexuality
--  .0021 percent of all of those who served during that period.
 An unpublished Army study during the same period puts homosexual
discharges in perspective.  It found there were 3,153 administrative
discharges for homosexuality between 1983 and 1991 but five times
(13,655) more for alcohol abuse and four times (10,845) more for
personnel being overweight.
<P>
The article also fails to mention homosexual punitive separations
which were not included in the GAO report.  A study obtained from
the Pentagon under the Freedom of Information Act analyzed 100
Army cases from 1989 to 1992.  Forty-nine percent of those cases
involved children as victims.  Eighty-five percent involved victims
who had not consented, and five percent of the offenders were
HIV-positive.[17]
<P>
The same report summarized a 1992 incident at Fort Hood, Texas,
where 60 homosexual men [soldiers and civilians] met in a public
toilet next to a child care center.  The men cut holes in the
walls to permit sex between men in adjacent stalls.  The men also
installed a mirror to allow them to see the approach of intruders.
<P>
These homosexuals were indiscriminate in their choice of partners
and often engaged in sex within moments of entering the bathroom.
 Sexual acts included oral and anal sodomy, mutual masturbation,
and fondling of the buttocks.  All soldiers in this incident received
disciplinary discharges which would not have been measured by
the 1992 GAO study.  This information was neither cited by GAO
nor by the <I>AJP</I> review.
<P>
<B>4. Relies on debunked Kinsey research to distort the
estimate of homosexuals in the military.</B>  The authors state,
&quot;Most authors feel this [4 percent exclusively homosexual]
is too conservative and that about 7 percent to 10 percent are
primarily homosexual in orientation.  Kinsey et al. also found
that 37 percent of males between childhood and old age had experienced
homoerotic orgasm, and another 13 percent claimed to have had
homoerotic stimulation without overt contact.  If these epidemiological
data are reliable, the policy of the Department of Defense would
severely limit the induction and retention of service members...strict
adherence to the Kinsey data and the policy of the Department
of Defense would result in the elimination of every other soldier
(37 percent plus 13 percent) in today's military.&quot;[18]
<P>
Alfred C. Kinsey, an Indiana University zoologist, who authored
<I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I> in 1948, based his research
on 12,000 interviews.  Kinsey relied heavily on data gleaned from
criminals and extrapolated his findings to the general population.
 Psychologist Abraham Maslow said that Kinsey's work, like all
sex surveys, had a high margin of &quot;volunteer&quot; error
because many people are not honest or willing to talk about their
most intimate sexual secrets.[19] 
<P>
No reputable survey has replicated Kinsey's findings, and a number
of recent studies suggest that the homosexual population is considerably
less than 10 percent of the U.S. population.  For example, a 1991
national survey of sexually active adults done by the National
Opinion Research Center shows that 98.4 percent of adults were
exclusively heterosexual that year.[20] A 1993 survey by the Battelle
Human Affairs Research Centers found that only 1.1 percent of
all Americans are exclusively homosexual.[21] A survey conducted
by the Alan Guttmacher Institute in 1993 found that one percent
of men consider themselves exclusively homosexual.[22] And a 1994
National Health and Social Life Survey at the University of Chicago
found that 2.8 percent of men and 1.4 percent of women identified
themselves as homosexual or bisexual.[23]
<P>
A March 1994 article in the <I>American Journal of Psychiatry</I>
cites several surveys of American men showing the prevalence of
homosexuality.  For example, the National Survey of Men found
that only 1.1 percent of men have been exclusively homosexual
during the preceding 10 years.  Another study found that 2.4 percent
of men are currently homosexual.[24]
<P>
<B>5. Relies on outdated polls to indicate that the public
supports lifting the ban. </B>The article cites two surveys done
before the national debate to suggest that Americans now favor
lifting the ban.[25]  It does not cite surveys with contradictory
findings nor does it discuss these contradictions.
<P>
Public support for lifting the ban eroded as the debate intensified
in 1993.  Midway through the debate, support for lifting the ban
was no more than 40 percent.[26] A national poll by Fabrizio, McLaughlin
&amp; Associates in March 1993 found that a decisive 54 percent
to 37 percent of voters disagreed that President Clinton should
overrule military leaders such as General Colin Powell and require
the military to accept homosexuals.[27]
<P>
Most military personnel support the ban.  A February 1993 <I>Los
Angeles Times</I> survey found that 40 percent of service members
disapprove, on moral grounds, of lifting the ban and 46 percent
said lifting the ban would enter into their reenlistment decisions.
 Another 11 percent said flatly that they would not reenlist because
of it.[28] A February 1993 CNN/Gallup Poll found that 74 percent
of men who had not attended college opposed lifting the ban. 
This is the prime recruiting population.
<P>
In essence, this review selectively cites survey data to support
its position, implying that no other dissimilar results have been
found.  
<P>
<B>6. Ignores the law and relies on Clinton's inconsistent
policy.</B>  The article makes no mention of the military's homosexual
law which was signed by President Clinton on November 30, 1993.
 The authors suggest that the regulations will &quot;generate
a series of court cases based on the freedom of speech and self-incrimination
statutes of the U.S. Constitution.&quot;[29]
<P>
No doubt the new regulations will be contested in the courts.
 The fact that the law and the new regulations are inconsistent,
however, is significant.  This fact was ignored by the authors.
 Consider some of the problems:
<P>
<LI>The Clinton Administration interpreted the law to permit so-called
&quot;celibate&quot; homosexuals to serve.  This view, i.e., that
&quot;celibate&quot; homosexuals even exist, contradicts past
legal rulings and will lead to more homosexuals serving and fewer
investigations of their likely misconduct.
<P>
<LI>The regulations dropped the critical statement that &quot;homosexuality
is incompatible with military service.&quot;  While Congress has
carried this principle forward in the law, Secretary of Defense
William Perry failed to include it in the regulations.[30]
<P>
<LI>The new policy potentially cripples military discipline by creating
a number of new obstacles before investigations can be started.
 Thus the regulations prevent commanders from investigating soldiers
for homosexuality without clear evidence that they have done something
criminally wrong.  According to Perry, attending gay pride parades,
frequenting gay bars, and possessing gay materials are not &quot;credible&quot;
evidence to initiate an investigation.[31]
<P>
<LI>The &quot;Perry rules&quot; also prevent criminal investigation
agencies from looking into most cases of adult, private, consensual
sexual misconduct, e.g., sodomy and adultery.[32]
<P>
<LI>Under the Perry rules, and directly contrary to more than 200
years of military practice, the DoD no longer considers homosexual
or bisexual behavior a marker for increased security risk.  Questions
about homosexuality were removed from security background investigations,
and information discovered during a security investigation cannot
be used for adverse action without high-level political permission.[33]
<P>
Clinton's Pentagon appointees are now pointing to the constant
number of homosexual discharges as proof that the policy is fine
as implemented.[34] This is misleading.  Most homosexuals facing
discharge do not challenge their separation.  However, it takes
just one advocate to exploit the weaknesses in the regulations
and then a court, deferring to the &quot;military's&quot; interpretation,
will strike down the statute as unconstitutional.   
<P>
Meanwhile, many soldiers are uncertain about Clinton's policy.
 In October 1994, military sociologist Charles Moskos conducted
an informal survey of soldiers in Haiti.  He found that 39 percent
thought the policy too lenient, 36 percent thought it to be a
good policy, and 22 percent were not sure.[35]  
<P>
<B>7. Attacks current policy requiring military psychiatrists
to report homosexual service members.</B>[36] The military does not
recognize absolute doctor-patient confidentiality.  A military
physician treating someone for a disorder that disqualifies the
member from continued service is bound by the regulation to report
the situation.  This is important for deployment and health readiness
purposes.
<P>
<B>8. Distorts facts about allied military experiences
with homosexuals.</B>  The article states, &quot;a survey of the
policies and practices of NATO armies revealed that only 24 percent
(4 of 17: New Zealand, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United
States) had exclusionary and separation policies.&quot;[37] The authors
ignore the June 1993 GAO report on &quot;Homosexuals in the Military:
 Policies and Practices of Foreign Countries.&quot;[38] This report
certainly could have been obtained and cited, given the number
of allowed revisions.  The GAO reviewed 25 countries and selected
four countries for detailed analysis.  The report states that
11 countries have policies that do not permit homosexuals to serve
in the military, 11 have policies that do.  Three of the latter
11 countries do not have any laws, regulations, or policies that
address this issue.  An unpublished Pentagon study conducted in
December 1992 found that some of those countries that permit homosexuals
to serve do so with strict guidelines. 
<P>
Testimony before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees
(SASC and HASC) in April and May 1993 illustrates the dramatic
differences between foreign militaries and our own.  For example,
the Netherlands started a homosexual military experiment in 1974.
 That nation has 65,000 service members, including 40,000 conscripts
who serve 14 months and who primarily commute from home each day.
 The U.S. has 2.5 million active and reserve service personnel
stationed in the U.S. and around the world at any given time.
 The German armed forces, which are included among those that
do <I>not</I> have an exclusionary policy, will not induct acknowledged
homosexual volunteers because they would &quot;undermine military
order and discipline.&quot;[39] Of the 476,300 members, 43 percent
are conscripts who, if identified as homosexual, may be required
to undergo psychological tests to determine their fitness.  The
German Federal Administrative Court declared in November 1990
that the military is justified in not allowing homosexuals to
serve in leadership and educational positions.
<P>
Foreign social experiences have little relevance for America's
military.  The U.S. is a superpower with urgent missions worldwide.
 America also has a radical homosexual community and a liberal
judicial system, a combination that guarantees a steady stream
of legal activism that is disruptive to military morale.
<P>
<B>9. Falsely claims that most societies approve of homosexuality.</B>
 The article states, &quot;Cultural studies....  In the early
1950s Ford and Beach studied 77 modern primitive societies concerning
attitudes toward homosexuality.  They found 28 condemned in which
it was condemned but 49, nearly two-thirds, in which it was approved
in more or less restricted forms.&quot;[40]
<P>
This observation is misleading.  Most modern societies consider
homosexuality a mental illness.  For example, a 1992 survey by
the APA's Office of International Affairs in conjunction with
the APA Committee of Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Psychiatrists
surveyed 125 psychiatric associations around the world.  It found
that all but three associations consider homosexuality a mental
illness or a sexual deviation.  U.S. psychiatrists are joined
only by Denmark and South Africa in their efforts to redefine
homosexuality and protect the &quot;right&quot; of homosexual
adults to conduct consensual sexual relations in private.[41]
<P>
<B>10. Misrepresents the pathological implications of
homosexuality.</B> The article cites a 1945 study of 183 former
college students known to be homosexual who served in the military
during World War II.  Sixty-four percent of these people &quot;served
with credible records.&quot;  The review also attributes the military's
decision no longer to view homosexuality as a mental illness to
the APA's 1973 decision to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders-II.[42]
<P>
The article states that only 64 percent of homosexuals in their
study had credible service records.  Rather than being an indication
of success, this should be an argument for exclusion.  Better
than 90 percent of the 8.5 million World War II era veterans &quot;served
with credible records.&quot;  
<P>
The implication is that since 64 percent in a single study had
&quot;credible&quot; records, there is no justification for the
exclusion.  This proves nothing.  They were honored for their
&quot;credible&quot; service to their country, not their homosexual
behavior.  After all, the ban was in force, so homosexuals were
forced to curb their behavior. 
<P>
The history of the American Psychiatric Association's decision
to change the DSM-II is worth examining.  Specifically, the military's
World War II experience provided considerable insight into human
behavior.  Specialists in military medicine literally rewrote
the diagnostic codes and nomenclature for psychiatric disorders
which, ultimately, became the format used by the American Psychiatric
Association in the 1980s and 1990s.  In 1952 the APA Council approved
and published a new nomenclature for categorizing mental disorders
similar to those used by the military.  The nomenclature identified
homosexuality as a pathologic behavior, i.e., &quot;sexual deviation,&quot;
under the section on Sociopathic Personality Disturbances.[43]
<P>
The second edition of the DSM for Mental Disorders continued to
identify homosexuality as a &quot;sexual deviation&quot; disorder.
 And since 1945 the Army has consistently held that homosexuality
is a behavioral problem, not a mental disease.[44]
<P>
From 1969 to 1971, homosexual activists stormed the annual meetings
of the APA demanding the normalization of homosexual behavior.
 In 1971 homosexual activists invaded the annual meeting, screaming
and kicking, seizing microphones, and denouncing psychiatry as
&quot;the enemy incarnate.&quot;[45]
<P>
The DSM was challenged at the 1973 meeting of the New England
Psychiatric Society by homosexual activists.  They recommended
that the nomenclature's section on &quot;sexual deviation&quot;
be renamed &quot;sexual dysfunction.&quot;  Later that year APA
Trustees ruled that homosexuality would no longer be listed as
a &quot;mental disorder&quot; in its official nomenclature of
mental disorders and recommended that it be replaced by the term
&quot;sexual orientation disturbance.&quot;[46]
<P>
According to author Ronald Bayer in <I>Homosexuality and American
Psychiatry: The Politics of Diagnosis</I>, homosexual activists
used intimidation to force the APA to remove homosexuality as
a mental illness from the DSM of psychiatric disorders.  &quot;The
result was,&quot; explained Bayer, &quot;not a conclusion based
upon an approximation of the scientific truth as dictated by reason,
but was instead an action demanded by the ideological temper of
the times.&quot;[47]
<P>
Homosexuality was subsequently regarded as a variant of sexual
orientation disturbance.  The &quot;nomenclature revolution&quot;
continued and in 1986 the last remaining term, &quot;ego-dystonic
homosexuality,&quot; was removed from the DSM.  This was done
over the protest of many psychiatrists who preferred to label
it a long standing disturbance originating in the early years
of life.[48]
<P>
The membership of the American Medical Association disagreed with
the APA's decision.  A 1975 AMA membership survey found that 69
percent agreed that homosexuality is &quot;pathological.&quot;[49]
 Additionally, psychotherapists such as Elizabeth Moberly, Gerald
van den Aardweg, Joseph Nicolosi, Charles Socarides, and Masters
and Johnson have reported much success helping homosexuals to
recover, thereby proving the point that it is curable.[50]
<P>
<B>11. Claims military homosexuals would not contribute
to poor morale.</B>  The article proposes three points concerning
military morale.  First, it blames immature recruits for the anti-homosexual
policy but fails to cite supporting data.  &quot;Many recruits,
who may be insecure in their own sexual orientation, may react
with various forms of discomfort to the presence of an identified
homosexual person.&quot;[51] Second, it acknowledges that &quot;subcultures
in a military organization can disrupt functioning of the unit...since
the military copes with many subcultures, it remains for the military
to make a convincing case that this [homosexual] subculture is
substantially and essentially so much more damaging&quot; to justify
&quot;the costs of [the] current policy.&quot;[52] The military's
significant experience with drug and alcohol subcultures provides
ample experience with damaging categories of behavior.  Finally,
the authors state, &quot;We expect that acceptance of homosexuals
in the military will increase, negating the need for a walled-off
subculture and resulting in more respect for the homosexual soldier.&quot;[53]
 The authors provide no reason or basis for this supposition.
<P>
Morale is defined as &quot;a strong sense of enthusiasm and dedication
to a commonly shared goal that unifies a group.&quot;  Heterosexual
soldiers forced to live and work with avowed homosexuals cannot
be expected to do so with &quot;...a strong sense of enthusiasm.&quot;
<P>
Open homosexuals tend to bind their basic identity with their
sexual orientation and practice: &quot;I am a homosexual,&quot;
as opposed to the American soldier's basic identity: &quot;I am
a soldier.&quot;  The homosexual's preoccupation with individual
behavioral characteristics is incongruent with and detracts from
the commonly shared goal -- accomplishment of the mission -- which
unifies heterosexual soldiers and subordinates their individual
goals to that of the group.
<P>
The homosexual subculture is recognized as &quot;liberated&quot;
or, in a manner of speaking, undisciplined.  This is inherently
at odds with the 24-hour discipline system within which soldiers
must live and work.  Homosexuals are distinguished from other
subcultures by their behavior [sodomy].  Another group behavioral
characteristic is a very high rate of promiscuity.  Military records
indicate that homosexuals are statistically more likely to engage
in misconduct than heterosexuals.  They have a higher incidence
of drug and alcohol abuse than heterosexuals.  If these statistics
aren't enough, much-touted books such as Randy Shilts' <I>Conduct
Unbecoming</I> and Mary Ann Humphrey's <I>My Country, My Right
to Serve</I> provide, perhaps unwittingly, ample testimony to
the disruptive nature of homosexuals in military units.
<P>
The voice of experience also indicates that homosexuals jeopardize
military morale.  For example, a survey of active duty officers
conducted for the American Security Council Foundation found that
99.03 percent said homosexuals would undermine the cohesiveness
and readiness of combat units.[54] The Defense Readiness Council
compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[55]
<P>
<B>12. Contends, against the evidence, that homosexuals
aren't a security risk</B>.  The article states that identifying
oneself as a homosexual is no more of a security risk than identifying
oneself as a heterosexual.  The authors call for the government
to show a &quot;nexus&quot; between the presence of homosexuals
and adverse impact on duty performance.[56]
<P>
This is a flawed argument.  Few people identify themselves as
heterosexual; that identity is assumed.  Homosexuals do, indeed,
identify themselves, however.
<P>
The article ignores the landmark research by Alan Bell and Martin
Weinberg, <I>Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and
Women</I>, which found that a significant number of homosexuals
report that &quot;someone has threatened [them with] exposure
of homosexuality in order to get something of value.&quot;[57]
<P>
If the threat of blackmail was the only problem with homosexuals
in the military, then lifting the prohibition would be justified.
 However, for the many reasons cited in this analysis, homosexuals
should not serve openly and security investigations are a valid
mechanism for enforcing the ban.
<P>
<B>13. Contends, against overwhelming evidence, that homosexuals
are not a special health risk.</B>  The article virtually ignores
the documented health risks associated with the homosexual lifestyle,
citing only the military's HIV screening program.  &quot;By policy,&quot;
the authors explain, &quot;no one who tests positive for the HIV
virus is allowed to enter active duty.&quot;[58]
<P>
Admitting open homosexuals into the military violates the legal
principle of the assumption of risk.  This principle states that
if you know there is a risk and you assume it, then don't complain
when the risk materializes.  The review's authors denigrate a
very serious risk.
<P>
A recent report from the University of Michigan found that people
with HIV are more capable of spreading the virus during the first
60 days of infection, but that blood tests during this period
do not find the HIV.[59] This means that the military assumes the
risk, even though all personnel are initially tested, that soldiers
will not be infected.  This is why screening out high-risk groups
and not just those who test positive for HIV is smart.  Unfortunately,
the Clinton Administration no longer screens out homosexuals --
the highest-risk group for contracting HIV.
<P>
The Army's Surgeon General, Lieutenant General Alcide Lanoue,
addressed the health risks associated with homosexuals:[60]
<P>
&quot;The military setting provides unique requirements for
safety in executing the Army blood transfusion program and for
preventing the transmission of blood-borne pathogens (especially
HIV and hepatitis B) in the field setting.  Homosexual males would
comprise a pool of ineligible blood donors and as a group are
at high risk of infection by HIV and hepatitis B, both significant
blood-borne pathogens which can infect other soldiers through
exposure to blood in peace and war.&quot; [During Operation Desert
Storm, there were five documented instances where blood was drawn
from soldiers and transfused.  In Somalia, five units of blood
were drawn and directly transfused to Somalis.  The urgency of
such transfusions precludes testing for the AIDS virus.]
<P>
&quot;HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Disease rates will
increase to the extent that the proportion of homosexual males
in the Army increases because homosexual/bisexual men are allowed
to enter and remain in the Army.&quot;  [The CDC reports that
most of the AIDS patients in this country are homosexuals.[61] Homosexuals
account for a disproportionate number of America's most serious
STD's, including syphilis, gonorrhea, genital warts, and hepatitis
A and B.[62] Moreover, the 1994 homosexual sex survey in <I>The Advocate</I>,
a leading homosexual magazine, found that 13 percent of respondents
were HIV-positive and only 18 percent had taken all three shots
in the hepatitis B vaccine series.  <I>The Advocate</I> article
admits &quot;Gay men are one of the top risk groups for being
exposed to hepatitis B.&quot;[63] ]
<P>
&quot;A male homosexual soldier is significantly more likely
than a heterosexual soldier to be nondeployable for medical reasons
related to HIV infection.  If HIV-infected, the soldier will be
permanently nondeployable.  Male homosexuals are more likely to
acquire sexually transmitted diseases which can render them nondeployable,
such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and hepatitis B.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Readiness from a medical standpoint will suffer if the restriction
is lifted.  The impact would be felt at the unit level, when the
homosexual soldier cannot train and deploy for health reasons.
 Likewise, the impact would be felt Army-wide in terms of the
military blood program and of the burden placed on the Army health
care system.&quot;
<P>
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homosexuals
are especially vulnerable to contracting HIV.  They are a high-risk
group because of co-factors associated with their lifestyle. 
These include recreational drug use, homosexual sex, malnutrition,
prior incidents of sexually transmitted diseases, and, most significantly,
sexual promiscuity.  
<P>
Homosexuals who participate in unsafe sex practices with multiple
partners and without taking precautions are at great risk of contracting
sexually transmitted diseases.  <I>The Advocate</I> survey found
that 72 percent of homosexual respondents engage in insertive
oral intercourse, 46 percent insertive anal intercourse, 45 percent
receptive anal-oral sex, 48 percent in three-way sex, 24 percent
in group sex (4 or more), and 10 percent in sadomasochism.[64] Most
of the homosexuals in the survey admitted to having had more than
30 sex partners over their lifetime, and about a third (35 percent)
report more than 100 partners.  The survey also found that homosexual
men use condoms only 1 time in 4.[65]
<P>
Heterosexuals have fewer sex partners than homosexuals.  A 1988-1990
General Social Survey found that 91 percent of men 25 to 29 years
of age are heterosexually active.  Nineteen percent of these men
have had only one lifetime sex partner, 55 percent have had 2
to 19 lifetime partners, and 25 percent have had 20 or more lifetime
partners.[66]
<P>
The University of Chicago published a national sex survey in October,
1994, which found that 20 percent of men have had only one sex
partner in their lifetime, 21 percent have had 2 to 4 partners,
17 percent had 5 to 10 partners, 16 percent had 11 to 20, and
17 percent report having had 21 or more sex partners.[67] However,
that survey excluded men over 59, who constitute one-sixth of
the population and who typically have more conservative sex lives.
 Thus the real figures probably are even lower for the population
of all men.[68]
<P>
Homosexuality also increases medical costs.  With the ban in place,
openly homosexual inductees are turned away.  However, with the
ban lifted, a homosexual recruit could contract HIV within days
or have early-stage HIV, test negative at first, and be accorded
full medical benefits for the rest of his life.  This is about
$120,000 in direct medical costs per AIDS patient.[69]
<P>
Dr. Edmund Tramont, Associate Director for retroviral research
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, published a 10-year projection
for HIV costs at $1.7 to $1.9 billion.[70]  However, he warns that
this is in 1989 dollars, is based on the present rate of new cases,
and assumes that only 60 percent of health care beneficiaries
will use the military health care system.  The potential 10-year
cost could rise to $5 billion if these assumptions are incorrect.[71]
 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services indicates that
the lifetime cost of treating a person with AIDS -- from diagnosis
until death -- is $102,000.[72] The American Medical Association
estimated the per-person AIDS patient cost would rise to $386,000
by the year 2000 and to $639,000 by the year 2008.[73]
<P>
As of April 1993 the military had dealt with 8,832 HIV-positive
service members.  Most have been separated from the service, but,
at that time, 1,580 were still on active duty.  Their status precluded
them from deploying overseas and necessitated special assignments
and special medical care.[74]
<P>
Homosexuals also have a much shorter life expectancy than heterosexuals,
as indicated by a study of more than 6,400 obituaries in 16 homosexual
newspapers.  The average age of homosexuals who died from AIDS
is 39; from all other causes it is 41.[75]
<P>
Substance addiction and abuse are called the second set of key
health problems after AIDS in the homosexual subculture (and violence
is third).[76]
<P>
Screening out homosexuals and discharging those discovered later
makes financial sense.  The 1992 GAO report states that the military
spent $26 million on homosexuals discharged.  The military spent
many times that figure treating homosexuals with AIDS -- people
who lied to enter the military and now receive full health and
pay benefits.  The cost-effective decision would be to minimize
the risk to the federal taxpayer by rejecting homosexuals before
they are recruited and discharging those later discovered.
<P>
<B>14. Cites legal challenges as indication that public
will soon favor homosexual service.</B>  The article briefly reviews
the current judicial climate regarding the military policy.  The
authors believe, &quot;With the increased public attention now
focused on the miliary policy, swift changes could sweep away
previous positions.&quot;[77]
<P>
The article cites two cases won by the government and the case
of Navy Petty Officer Keith Meinhold, who was discharged for saying
he was gay on national television.  Meinhold's case was labeled
&quot;the most recent legal case decided.&quot;[78]
<P>
Meinhold's case is not the most recent case decided.  The case
of former midshipman Joseph C. Steffan from the U.S. Naval Academy
was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
on November 22, 1994.  The decision from the country's &quot;second
highest court&quot; declared the military's homosexual ban constitutional.[79]
<P>
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled August
31, 1994 that a statement of homosexuality alone is insufficient
reason to discharge Meinhold.  That decision was limited only
to sailor Meinhold and struck down the lower court's decision
to extend the ruling to the entire Defense Department.[80]
<P>
Although numerous cases of former service members discharged for
homosexuality are now in the judicial system, there is no indication
that &quot;swift changes&quot; will &quot;sweep away previous
positions.&quot;  On the contrary, it is expected that the 104th
Congress will force the Clinton Administration to enforce the
homosexual law despite rulings that are in conflict with the law.
<P>
The issue of homosexuals in the military was cited as one of the
pivotal issues that collapsed the Democratic Party's majority
in Congress.  The new majority should respond by reinstating the
full homosexual ban, i.e., require the Clinton Administration
to obey the new homosexual law and to reintroduce the questions
for recruits at induction.
<P>
<B>15. Concludes that the ban is based solely on bad attitudes.</B>
 The article states, &quot;The strongest argument for excluding
and separating homosexual persons from military service is 
not mental illness or security risks but the presence of social
strictures and adverse attitudes.&quot;[81]
<P>
The authors ignore a wealth of information that comes from Congress's
oversight hearings in 1993.  Reasons include combat readiness
(cohesion, deployability risk, family and community risks); manpower
(recruitment and retention risks); cost (medical, housing, claims
from soldiers previously discharged for homosexuality, quality
of force sustainment, and lost productivity); and political (military
used as laboratory for social experimentation to satisfy the political
views of a small minority).  The article completely ignores these
concerns.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
&quot;Homosexuality and the Military&quot; is an article that
was rushed to press, was poorly reviewed, and does little for
the academic credibility of the APA -- an organization that should
be promoting sound research, not a moral agenda that abuses and
neglects available research.  The article is evidence that the
APA is playing an ever greater role in the promotion of the homosexual
agenda.

<P>
In the welfare debate last year, President Clinton himself stated
that &quot;the real source of [the] problem is the inordinate
number of out-of-wedlock births in this country.&quot;[1]  He also
conceded that &quot;there's no question that [ending welfare for
unwed mothers] would work.  The question is... 'Is it morally
right?'&quot;[2]
<P>
While the President's proposed policies leave much to be desired,
he has formulated precisely the right question to frame the current
debate over welfare reform in general and illegitimacy in particular.
 There can be no more important policy objective than the preservation
-- or more properly in this day and age, the revitalization --
of our nation's moral capital.  As James Q. Wilson wrote in his
oft-cited article, &quot;The Rediscovery of Character: Private
Virtue and Public Policy&quot;:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The essential first step is to acknowledge that at root, in almost
every area of important public concern, we are seeking to induce
persons to act virtuously....  Not only is such conduct desirable
in its own right, it appears now to be necessary if large improvements
are to be made in those matters we consider problems.[3]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
There exists a striking public consensus that the welfare state's
practice of subsidizing illegitimacy is not only a massive problem,
but a moral problem at root.
<P>
Even so unlikely a source as Bruce Reed, President Clinton's leading
aide on welfare reform, acknowledges that the essential purpose
of reform must be to reverse the alarming rise in out-of-wedlock
births.[4]  If not driven exclusively by AFDC &quot;benefits,&quot;
the increase has at least been sustained and perpetuated by the
expansion of a system that pays recipients to bear illegitimate
children.  Current trends indicate that by the year 2015 -- some
studies project as early as 2000 -- one of every two American
babies will be born to a single mother, and illegitimacy will
surpass divorce as the main cause of fatherlessness.  If a job
program succeeds in putting more unmarried welfare mothers to
work (which is unlikely on a sufficiently grand scale, given budget
constraints), we will still be left with roughly the same number 
of fatherless children.  While
Great Britain has already succeeded in implementing reforms that
make work economically more attractive than welfare, the reforms
of the 1980s have only served to underscore in both Britain and
America the fact that little progress can be made without addressing
the collapse of the family.[5]
<P>
No moral judgment even need be adduced to acknowledge that intact
families bestow upon individuals and communities advantages that
simply come no other way.  Empirical evidence amassed by social
scientists in the last ten years (and chronicled for popular consumption
by Barbara Dafoe Whitehead in her April 1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article,
&quot;Dan Quayle Was Right&quot;) has confirmed in exquisite detail
what those who have lived in broken families already know.  A
single woman with children is not a viable economic unit for the
vast majority, but children need biological fathers for much more
than the extra dollars they add to the family budget.  As social
scientist Charles Murray has written, single parenthood is &quot;damaging
to children in so many ways that to list them individually would
be to trivialize them.&quot;[6]
<P>
Not surprisingly, Dr. Murray also concludes that &quot;illegitimacy
is the single most important social problem of our time...because
it drives everything else.&quot;[7]  More than 70 percent of all
juveniles in state reform institutions, for example, come from
fatherless homes; and the relationship between crime and one-parent
families is so powerful that controlling for family structure
erases the relationship between crime and race and between crime
and low income.  Illegitimacy feeds itself, too.  Young white
women who grow up without a father in the home are more than twice
as likely to bear children out-of-wedlock and to do so during
their teenage years when they are most likely to form long-term
attachments to AFDC.
<P>
If those on the welfare rolls have suffered most conspicuously,
it is also true that the welfare system has corrupted the ideals
and narrowed the vision of many who live well beyond the bounds
of the inner city -- even as it is now threatening our most cherished
civic institutions.  One obvious casualty is the weakening of
our conviction that the so-called &quot;bourgeois virtues&quot;
are available to all, regardless of race or class.  Early American
social workers, like Mary Ellen Richmond, understood the importance
of middle class norm-setting.  &quot;The way to reintegrate the
deviant into society, she argued, is to educate and indeed direct
them toward the shared values of the mainstream culture.&quot;[8]
<P>
The role of the traditional two-parent family is essential in
sustaining the institutions of a free society precisely because
it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted from generation
to generation.  If the family fails to impart virtues that temper
and restrain behavior, broad legal freedoms must give way.  So,
too, human dignity and equality, as the Founders understood them.
 Virtue, historian Gertrude Himmelfarb has said, is the only true
basis of equality and the only requisite for citizenship.[9]  As
Charles Murray made clear in his now famous op-ed &quot;The Coming
White Underclass,&quot; either we act now to reduce illegitimacy
and to reinfuse our public policy with a commitment to higher
and nobler things -- or we run the risk of sabotaging the entire
experiment in democratic self-government.
<P>
Or, as Michael Novak put it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[T]he project of self-government depends on the capacity of citizens
to govern their own passions, urges, habits, and expectations.
 If they cannot govern their own lives individually, how can they
be successful in self-government as a republic?  The project of
self-government is moral -- or not at all.[10]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The Founding Fathers and many succeeding generations understood
that only a virtuous people can be free.  Do we?
<P>
Given the consequences for the individual child, the surrounding
community, and the national polity, bringing a baby into this
world without a sense of sacred responsibility cannot long be
regarded as a morally neutral act.  In a report issued in December
1994, the Progressive Policy Institute, policy arm of the Democratic
Leadership Council, joined others in acknowledging that &quot;it
is wrong -- not simply foolish or impractical -- for women and
men to make babies they cannot support emotionally and financially.&quot;[11]
 Donna Shalala made the same concession a year earlier, however
reluctantly, when she said in an interview, &quot;I don't like
to put this in moral terms, but I do believe that having children
out-of-wedlock is wrong.&quot;[12]
<P>
Congress should now recognize that it is also wrong to sanction
such activity by subsidizing it.  Republican strategist Bill Kristol
has said that &quot;neither our politics nor our sociology can
ultimately be neutral as to the content of the _laws of Nature
and Nature's God,_&quot;[13] chief among which is the fact that
we were made to live in families.  Charles Murray asks rhetorically:
 if &quot;a social policy that induces people to believe that
they are not responsible for their lives is one that inhibits
the pursuit of happiness and is to that extent immoral[,] [c]an
then a policy that <I>fails</I> to stigmatize be a moral one?&quot;[14]
<P>
Historical experience, related by Marvin Olasky and others, does
indeed demonstrate that the most effective social services have
been offered by private community groups, without any illusion
of moral neutrality.  In her seminal historical study <I>Poverty
and Compassion</I>, Gertrude Himmelfarb writes that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[a]fter making the most arduous attempt to objectify the problem
of poverty, to divorce poverty from any moral assumptions and
conditions, we are learning how inseparable the moral and material
dimensions of that problem are.  And after trying to devise social
policies that are scrupulously neutral and _value-free,_ we are
finding these policies fraught with moral implications that have
grave material and social consequences.[15]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
George Liebmann says, more simply, in a recent issue of <I>The
American Enterprise</I>, &quot;Rescuing an underclass is by definition
a highly moralistic undertaking.&quot;[16]  While controlling welfare
spending is a happy byproduct of terminating benefits to teen
mothers, even more promising is the opportunity to begin reversing
the message of the counterculture that has so eroded the character
of our people, in part by assaulting the family.
<P>
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has used the phrase &quot;defining
deviancy down&quot; to describe Americans' tendency to ignore
excess levels of deviancy by normalizing what used to be considered
pathology.  Only by &quot;defining deviancy down&quot; have we
been able to ignore until now all the signs of impending disaster
that attend a burgeoning illegitimacy rate.  Barbara Whitehead's
1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article heralded a real and significant change
in the public mood, however; and the near-mythic ascendancy of
Charles Murray's &quot;Coming White Underclass&quot; piece the
same year seemed to confirm a general convergence of public opinion.
 In a recent Family Research Council survey of 1,000 Americans,
a substantial majority (81 percent) of respondents indicated that
&quot;women having babies out of wedlock that they can't support
financially&quot; is a serious problem.  The mounting public consensus
presents a unique opportunity to implement more than symbolic
change in the 104th Congress and to make sanctions against illegitimacy
the focus of that change.
<P>
In sending his welfare package to Congress more than 30 years
ago, President Kennedy articulated contemporary liberals' fundamental
misunderstanding of the causal role welfare plays in boosting
illegitimacy rates.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[W]elfare programs, [he said], must contribute to the attack
on . . . family breakdown [and] illegitimacy. . . .  Unless such
problems are dealt with effectively, they fester, and grow, sapping
the strength of society as a whole and extending their consequences
in troubled families from one generation to the next.[17]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Kennedy's insight about the consequences has proven historically
accurate; but his &quot;service&quot; approach to curbing illegitimacy
worked no better than the current President's will -- a fact which
an unnamed aide on the Clinton welfare task force acknowledged
last year.
<P>
While the President advocates a massive and expensive public relations
campaign against out-of-wedlock births, his aide confided to <I>Newsweek</I>
reporter Joe Klein: &quot;We looked at a hundred different programs
around the country that were trying to deal with this problem,
and not one of them moved the needle.  There just weren't any
results.&quot;[18]  Likewise, a formal study of the Teenage Parent
Demonstration, sponsored by the Department of Health and Human
Services in response to &quot;persistently high rates of teenage
pregnancies and births,&quot; found that &quot;[t]he program had
an unusual and disappointing pattern of impacts on pregnancy and
birth rates . . . despite . . . the substantial efforts of the
programs to empower [the] young mothers to take control of their
fertility.&quot;[19]
<P>
Charles Murray anticipated the problem in his 1988 book <I>In
Pursuit of Happiness and Good Government</I>.  &quot;The task,&quot;
he concludes, &quot;is not to devise a public relations campaign
to discourage single teenage girls from having babies, but to
neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings
to form families.&quot;[20]  Eliminating grants to unwed teenage
mothers will be necessary, but not sufficient, to restore the
integrity of the family unit.
<P>
Only by historical accident were unwed mothers -- of any age --
ever included in the AFDC program.  Frances Perkins, President
Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor and chief architect of welfare
policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers
because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate
family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority
in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal
member of the Roosevelt Administration because they rejected that
intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.  It is the
potential to reverse that sad experience that must define &quot;compassion&quot;
in the present debate.  As the one policy option that promises
to effect change in the current system, restrictions on benefits
by definition constitute the compassionate alternative.
<P>
Himmelfarb notes that the word &quot;compassion&quot; once described
&quot;a moral sentiment, not a political principle, a sentiment
evoked by _misery_ or _sorrow,_ not by poverty as such.&quot;[21]
 As political salvationism sought to preempt traditional morals
in the last 30 years, it was only natural that moral sentiments
should be confused with political principles.  Likewise, that
misery and sorrow should be equated with material poverty; for
the redefinition of compassion required a highly artificial view
of man as no more than a material being.
<P>
If compassion is once again properly understood, perhaps then
it will become more obvious that the object of our concern must
be &quot;misery&quot; and &quot;sorrow,&quot; not economic poverty,
and that the &quot;misery&quot; most evident today is the spiritual
and moral deprivation visited upon dependents of the welfare system.
 It is time that we stop suppressing the moral responsibilities
that make life precious for a resident of the inner city just
the same as for a middle-class suburbanite.  It is time, in short,
to secure equal access to the central satisfactions of family,
virtue, and freedom.

<P>
Again, in the course of the welfare debate, the abortion issue
has demonstrated its unique capacity to mobilize and divide.
<P>
Pro-life advocates who resist the so-called family cap, which
would freeze benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare, fear with some justification that the
cap could promote an increase in abortions.  Pro-life advocates
who support the measure share both this concern and the long-term
goal of driving abortions to the point of zero.  Unlike the more
conventional conflict between pro-life and pro-choice groups,
pro-life differences over the family cap represent a dispute over
means, not ends, that is complicated by the absence of any hard
data from actual experimentation.
<P>
Such differences lend themselves to reasoned discussion and, ultimately,
resolution far more easily than the larger debate for and against
abortion rights, which Laurence Tribe has characterized as a &quot;clash
of absolutes.&quot;  While the choice between life and death cannot
be accurately described as a &quot;clash of absolutes,&quot; the
phrase does capture usefully the impossibility of winning adherents
to the pro-life cause without first changing hearts, one at a
time.  In other words, we should forfeit no battles, but neither
can we expect to win the war against abortion on demand without
a comprehensive, long-term strategy to develop and sustain a pro-life
consensus.
<P>
While a pro-life position must be part of the agenda for national
renewal, opposition to abortion must be only one plank of the
pro-life platform.  A crisis as broad and deep as abortion on
demand requires a transformation of the political and moral culture
as well as a reform of law.  Reducing illegitimacy is the <I>sine
qua non</I> of moral reconstruction; and right-to-life activists
should realize that, as one of the few weapons in the anti-illegitimacy
arsenal, the family cap not only serves their cause in the long-term
but deserves their active support in the short-term -- subject
to the critical qualification that there must be no attendant
funding for abortions.
<P>
No hard data are available to demonstrate that the family cap
stimulates the abortion rate.  And there is reason to think that
the family cap will <I>not</I> increase abortions, even in the
short-term.    
<P>
Feminists and welfare rights activists argue that the current
benefits level is already far too low to cover the costs associated
with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical to maintain that a cap
would have a sufficiently significant impact on the &quot;affordability&quot;
of another child to necessitate such a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
The decision to abort, anyhow, is far more than an economic calculation.
 Twenty years of spiraling illegitimacy rates in the face of liberalized
abortion laws demonstrate that many individuals do not regard
abortion as a viable option.  Policy data collected by the Family
Research Council suggest that abortion is even less acceptable
to poor women;[1] and an article recently published in <I>Family
Planning Perspectives</I> found that abortion rates for teen welfare
mothers are <I>lower</I> than national averages for all teenage
girls.[2]
<P>
Those who are tempted to conclude that it is the availability
of welfare checks that reduces the abortion rate, relative to
the general population, should keep in mind the basis of comparison.
 That hypothesis -- that limited cash benefits suppress the abortion
rate -- would predict a <I>lower</I> rate of abortion in the general
population, relative to welfare mothers, because the average member
of the general population has more economic resources at her disposal.
 The empirical data, however, refute the hypothesis; and Douglas
Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute has commented that,
to the contrary, &quot;[k]ids who have less to lose . . . are
less likely to have an abortion.&quot;[3]       
<P>
The finding that abortion rates for teen welfare mothers are lower
than national averages for all teenage girls is a powerful suggestion
that non-economic factors determine the decision to carry a child
to term.  Other research supports the claim that, whether conception
was intended or not, most illegitimate births to underclass women
today are &quot;wanted.&quot;[4] Certainly, there is ample anecdotal
evidence to suggest that some girls have babies because they want
&quot;something to love&quot; -- or, worse yet, because their
peer group has perversely defined a baby as a status symbol.[5]
<P>
Others, including the young welfare mother who testified before
a recent congressional hearing on illegitimacy, simply believe
that abortion is wrong and choose not to compound their first
mistake by committing another.  While poverty dispirits some lives,
in others it serves to highlight the intangibles that make life
most sacred.  The point of decrying moral deterioration among
the underclass is to assert an easily forgotten truth: every person,
regardless of economic status, is capable of the very moral commitments
that argue most forcefully against abortion.
<P>
Even assuming that our ultimate objective is to save as many lives
as possible, it is by no means clear that the appropriate operational
measure of success in assessing the family cap would be the number
of lives saved in the short-term -- if such a number could be
approximated in the future as it cannot be now.  The question
itself is a red herring because it obscures the larger and more
important issue: &quot;What constitutes progress toward ending
altogether the culture that finds abortion acceptable?&quot;
<P>
Deciding on a rational means to maximize the total number of lives
saved in fact requires two sets of measures for maximizing that
good -- human lives saved in the short-term and human lives saved
over the course of several generations.  Since the policy changes
under consideration affect illegitimacy and the structure of the
welfare system, the number of lives saved in the long-run should
include both children who would have been aborted as well as the
children who would have fallen prey to the violent crime that
results from, as James Q. Wilson put it, &quot;neglecting the
processes by which the underclass reproduces itself.&quot;[6]
<P>
While there is no point at which the short-term perspective loses
relevance, few would dispute that there exists some point at which
the long-term implications demand consideration.  If it is true
that preserving the current benefits package will save lives,
presumably we could save even more lives by increasing the entitlements
tenfold.  Yet, most right-to-life activists intuitively understand
that there is an alternative good to be served by restricting
benefits that will in no way compromise our commitment to life.
<P>
Charles Murray wrote in his 1988 book <I>In Pursuit of Happiness
and Good Government</I>, in a passage that defined the parameters
and the language of the above analysis: &quot;It cannot be . .
. that the objective of a program is to save lives.  It may be
the <I>operational</I> measure of success, but it cannot be the
<I>construct</I> . . . because it has no discriminatory power.
. . .  One can too easily think of measures that will save lives
efficiently but are also totalitarian.&quot;[7]
<P>
The construct we are really interested in is &quot;advancing the
pro-life cause,&quot; which we may attempt to operationalize by
estimating the total number of lives saved now and later as a
result of the proposed policy change -- in this case, the family
cap.  And there is no question that reducing illegitimacy by imposing
restrictions on welfare benefits will serve the over-arching purpose
of the pro-life movement.
<P>
As Chuck Donovan explained in a paper published by the Family
Research Council, it is a basic statistical fact that marital
status and the abortion rate are inextricably linked.  The vast
majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women -- and
the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, therefore, we
should reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy
that create a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.
<P>
Right-to-life activists who oppose measures to reduce illegitimacy
are helping to sustain the very system that encourages young women
to find themselves in the predicament that makes abortion seem
as attractive as it possibly could.  Opposition to the family
cap is a curiously negative way to affirm life.  Although it should
be noted that many pro-life advocates are the ones on the front
lines offering material assistance to unwed mothers who do decide
to keep their babies, it would be far more compassionate to try
to preclude the need for that help in the first place.
<P>
Glenn Loury and James Q. Wilson argued convincingly at recent
welfare hearings before the Human Resources subcommittee that
the problems of illegitimacy and abortion are moral -- not material
-- problems.  They require spiritual solutions which no government
can provide directly.  Yet, Loury writes, &quot;in every community
there are agencies of moral and cultural development that seek
to shape the ways in which individuals conceive of their duties
to themselves, of their obligations to each other, and of their
responsibilities before God.&quot;[8]
<P>
In many communities, right-to-life organizations are those very
agencies, and they deserve credit and gratitude they don't often
receive.  By gradually eliminating federal benefits, poor women
who are pregnant out of wedlock will be forced to turn to local
organizations, including right-to-life crisis pregnancy groups,
that will counsel against abortion and discourage further irresponsible
behavior.
<P>
Launching the arguments against illegitimacy in the context of
the current debate over those benefits will give new rhetorical
emphasis and more widespread attention to the arguments against
abortion; for, the two ills spring from the same misconception
that life is cheap and motherhood bears no sacred responsibility.
 Indeed, the bipartisan focus on illegitimacy is one of the most
golden opportunities we have had in quite some time to reverse
the message of the counterculture that has made abortion &quot;rights&quot;
seem palatable.
<P>
Yet, to increase the logic and appeal of pro-life arguments to
a significant number of people who do not now see the moral force
in such arguments, we must begin the task of rebuilding other
civic institutions that will nourish human souls and liberate
them to fulfill their full potential.  Such an ambitious project
will require a multifaceted strategy, and eliminating the welfare
benefits that encourage illegitimacy will be a key component of
that strategy.
<P>
The interconnections linking functioning communities with functioning
families are so rife and so apparent that even Democrats now concede
Dan Quayle was right.  Illegitimacy, by definition, is the failure
of families to form in the first place; and by driving a host
of social problems that corrode communities and erode the national
character, illegitimacy promotes the failing of family on a grand
scale.
<P>
Charles Murray writes that affiliation -- including family affiliation
-- is a means whereby people of common values are enabled to enact
those values.  A functioning community that promotes a wide array
of affiliations provides an extremely important venue both for
practicing virtue and for passing down to the next generation
the habit of virtue.[9] The pro-life movement is itself a classic
example of people expressing their interests and values through
affiliations that are sustained by a rich network of institutions
outside of -- and sometimes even in opposition to -- government.
<P>
Arguably, members of the underclass do not now have the same type
of privilege; but they should and could if we begin, in Michael
Joyce's words, &quot;the resuscitation of the civic sphere which
alone makes genuine citizenship possible.&quot;[10] Because civil
institutions are the very institutions that cultivate character,
that &quot;appeal to and sustain spirit and heart as much as mind,&quot;[11]
reconstructing them will engender a far more lasting commitment
to pro-life principles than obstruction of the family cap.  Michael
Joyce has explained eloquently: &quot;Through . . . countless,
subtle, daily interactions, our civil institutions give form and
substance to the everyday qualities and values without which life
itself would be impossible.&quot;[12]
<P>
Paradoxical as it may seem, reforming the culture will be the
most expedient complementary strategy for winning new and permanent
legal victories against abortion.  If any issue position depends
on one's idea of man, it is abortion.  And an individual's idea
of man is not something that gives way to clever arguments in
court or the Congress.  Instead, it is shaped and formed from
childhood by the quiet but pervasive messages of the surrounding
society in which children grow and develop into adults.
<P>
In addition to changing notions of the individual, we must also
change the related conception of government.  If we succeed in
restoring a commitment to limited government, the courts will
be under increasing pressure to reverse the abortion decisions
that have, in George Weigel and Bill Kristol's analysis, &quot;[reduced]
the actors in American society to the coercive state and the radically
autonomous individual, bereft of all social ties and responsibilities.&quot;[13]
 There is no better way to undermine this &quot;America of strangers,&quot;
to use Richard John Neuhaus' phrase, than to restore the civil
institutions that nurture the daily interactions and affiliations
that are anathema to the proponents of centralized government.
<P>
Right-to-life advocates give collective voice to a magnificent
idealism in our political discourse.  To them, it does not matter
that a decrease in abortions will mean a disproportionate increase
in minority babies born to low-income parents.  It does matter
that abortions end innocent lives because life is eminently sacred
and precious.
<P>
Thus, pro-lifers should understand more fully than anyone in the
debate over the family cap that abortion is not an issue that
can be nickel-and-dimed or reduced to a scientific calculation
of anticipated marginal changes in the abortion rate.  The very
attempt threatens, however unintentionally, to promote the same
thoroughly dehumanized and despiritualized view of life in which
pro-abortion forces indulge.
<P>
If our objective is to find a rational means to maximize the number
of lives saved over time, it bears repeating that, for Aristotle,
&quot;conformity with a rational principle&quot; meant something
far more humane than a cold mathematical calculation of odds.
 He distinguished between &quot;theoretical wisdom,&quot; which
is more akin to a scientific process, and &quot;practical wisdom,&quot;
defined as &quot;the capacity of deliberating well about what
is good and advantageous.&quot;  Aristotle knew that in making
decisions the best of statesmen would draw upon this more indefinable
wisdom that is an equal but different part of rationality.  So
should we draw upon the best part of our wisdom in evaluating
the costs and benefits of the proposed family cap.[14]
<P>
We should also bear in mind that what we think about the right
to life has an organic relationship with our vision of the kind
of society we should institute.  In the end, it really is not
possible to think about one in isolation from the other; or else
the arguments lose impetus, grow artificial and -- lifeless.
<P>
Not by coincidence, the Declaration speaks of &quot;life&quot;
in the same breath with &quot;liberty&quot; and &quot;the pursuit
of happiness,&quot; two conditions that speak directly to the
question of how best to organize society.  The Founders instituted
a limited government to secure natural rights, including the right
to life; but as George Will noted in a recent editorial, &quot;Our
creed of limited government . . . [has a] corollary vision of
human capacities and of the life worth living,&quot; captured
by the phrase &quot;pursuit of happiness.&quot;[15]
<P>
The Founders would have scoffed at the notion that the protection
of life and limb alone is an adequate notion of &quot;happiness,&quot;
and right-to-life activists forget that at their peril in the
present debate over the family cap.  By opposing the current system
of welfare benefits, we advocate a transformation of the political
and social culture that will sustain both &quot;happiness&quot;
and a more enduring pro-life consensus than even legal reform
can hope to accomplish.

<title>GOALS 2000: THE CASE FOR REPEAL</title>

<h2>GOALS 2000:<br>
THE CASE FOR REPEAL</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>
To an ailing American education system, Goals 2000 offers further
centralization, added bureaucracy, and federal coercion -- and
calls it a prescription for local freedom.
<p>
But Americans have overwhelmingly objected to the &quot;government
knows best&quot; philosophy of which Goals 2000 is another manifestation.
If the 104th Congress intends to keep its campaign promises of
decentralizing authority, returning power to states and localities,
empowering American families, balancing the budget, and reducing
the deficit, then Goals 2000 must be repealed. It is an impediment
to these goals. Leaving intact the Goals 2000 formula for restructuring
American education will undo any education reform Congress hopes
to accomplish.
<p>
Goals 2000 (P.L. 103-227) is the Clinton Administration's plan
to drastically restructure the American education system. &quot;Goals
2000 establishes overall direction for a new local-state-federal
partnership in education,&quot; writes Gordon M. Ambach, executive
director of the Council of Chief State School Officers.[1] It increases
the federal role by imposing a congressional formula for reform
on any state, school district, or school that wishes to receive
funding under this act.
<p>
The priority of the restructuring agenda can be seen in the appropriations.
Less than half the funding for Goals 2000 will reach local schools
in this first year of its existence. Of the $105 million appropriated
for Goals 2000 in FY 94, $92.4 million (88 percent) is targeted
toward state grants. Stipulations in the law require that only
45 percent of each state's grant be filtered down to individual
schools.[2] That means only $42 million, or 40 percent of the original
appropriation, will ever reach the schools. The other 60 percent
constitutes the bureaucratic skim that is being used at each level
to create the new framework for the educational system.
<p>
The danger of the Goals 2000 restructuring agenda is that all
future federal experimentation with education will be easily inculcated
into the new network. Local schools will be extremely vulnerable
to manipulation and have little, if any, autonomy.
<p>
The bureaucratic waste and ominous restructuring agenda of Goals
2000 are just the beginning of the argument against this legislation
that will radically change American education. Its ten titles
contain dozens of problem areas that warrant the repeal of Goals
2000.
<p>
<center><h3>TITLE I -- NATIONAL EDUCATION GOALS</h3></center>
<p>
This title codifies eight national education goals. Six were agreed
to in 1990 by governors and President Bush following the Charlottesville
education summit. The other two goals, parental participation
and teacher education, were added as bait to sell the Goals 2000
legislation to interest groups, such as teacher unions and the
PTA, which supposedly represent the views of teachers and parents.
<p><ul>
<li>The concept of national education goals is based on faulty
logic. If the federal government is setting goals, that presupposes
that it has the authority and ability to ensure the accomplishment
of the goals. Reaching national education goals will require an
unprecedented federal intrusion in schools.
<p>
<li>Had the goals been popularly developed and had Americans
asked for federal supervision in achieving them, Goals 2000 might
be procedurally, if not philosophically, a legitimate plan. They
did not and it is not. Secretary Riley reveals this as he retells
the history of the Goals 2000 legislation:
<p><ul>
In the first place, educators had not been in on the ground floor
when the National Education Goals were developed in 1989 and 1990.
The goals were viewed by many as a classic example of a top-down
reform imposed on localities.... Nor had parents, citizens, or
the business community been brought into the picture in a meaningful
way.... Finally, neither members of Congress nor state legislators
had a hand in crafting the goals.... The truth was that the reform
movement at the national level had absolutely no statutory basis....
The National Education Goals, three years after their announcement,
had no legal standing of any kind.[3]
</ul><p>
<li>National education goals cannot be reached through a <I>voluntary</I>
program. If the Clinton Education Department intends to reach
these goals, they certainly cannot believe that Goals 2000 is
voluntary, or at least they do not intend that it will be optional
for long. The goals are stated in section 102 using all-inclusive
language: &quot;all students will leave grades 4, 8, and 12 having
demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter...,&quot;
and &quot;every school in the United States will be free of drugs....&quot;
These goals absolutely cannot be accomplished through a voluntary
program. The crafters of this legislation were either deceived
or deceptive when they touted Goals 2000 as voluntary.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE II -- NATIONAL EDUCATION REFORM LEADERSHIP,<br>
STANDARDS AND ASSESSMENTS</h3></center>
<p>
Understanding title II is key to understanding the significance
and danger of the Goals 2000 legislation. This title is the heart
of the restructuring agenda. It creates two new national bureaucracies:
the National Education Goals Panel (NEGP) and the National Education
Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC).
<p>
The driving force of the Goals 2000 reform plan lies in title
II: <I>standards</I>. Three types of national standards are defined:
content standards, performance standards and opportunity-to-learn
standards. In order to apply for a grant under Goals 2000, each
state must develop its own content, performance and opportunity-to-learn
standards, or adopt the national standards in each of the three
areas (see title III).
<p>
Title II is very problematic for anyone who believes in a decentralized
system of education:
<p><ul>
<li>Clearly, adding bureaucracy is contrary to the goals of
this Congress. It will not lead to better education, only waste.
<p>
<li>Goals 2000 called for the creation of the National Education
Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC) within 120 days of the
law's enactment (March 31, 1994) [Sec. 212(e)]. The council was
not named during that time, nor has it been since then, yet in
FY 94 $2 million was appropriated for its use. To what end were these
funds used?
<p>
<li>NESIC was to &quot;identify areas in which voluntary national
content standards need to be developed&quot; [Sec. 213(a)(1)(A)].
Since NESIC has not been formed it obviously has not performed
this function. Which bureaucrat decided what standards projects
would be funded? With such anonymity there is no accountability.
<p>
<li>The content standards are being presented to school personnel
and the general public as though they have been officially and
legally approved. Neither of these can happen because the body
set up by law to certify the standards -- NESIC -- does not exist.
It is misleading to present these as <I>the</I> &quot;national
standards&quot; when they have been neither federally nor popularly
approved.
</ul><p>
The <I>National Standards for United States History,</I> produced
by the Center for History in the Schools, are a case in point.
A politically correct account of American history, these standards
are being presented to history teachers as <I>the national standards</I>.
While Congress may believe it has addressed the issue with the
Senate's 99 to 1 vote to reject the U.S. history standards, this
non-binding resolution was merely symbolic. In Goals 2000, Congress
gave authority over the standards to NESIC. That makes the Senate's
resolution only a good gesture. Congress should follow this vote
to reject the history standards with a vote of much greater significance:
the repeal of the entire Goals 2000 legislation, which calls for
national standards and has the potential to produce more material
like the U.S. history standards.
<p><ul>
<li>The federal government should not be involved in the creation
of standards. Government-endorsed standards are by nature coercive,
not voluntary, and will create a body of &quot;official knowledge.&quot;
This is contrary to the American tradition of freedom of thought.
Furthermore, content standards deal with curriculum, an area which
the federal Department of Education was expressly forbidden to
enter when it was created in 1979. The creation, critique and
usage of standards must remain a community endeavor. No further
federal money should be spent on standards projects, and there
should be no federal certification or endorsement of existing
standards. Political involvement results in politically-charged
standards. Imagine the reaction of those unoffended by the original
history standards if new standards were developed under the leadership
of Sen. Jesse Helms or Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</ul><p>
Opportunity-to-learn (OTL) standards are an especially troublesome
element of title II:
<p><ul>
<li>These standards shift the focus of reform back to increasing
inputs into education, a tried-and-failed method. OTL standards
chosen by states and school districts will require schools to
provide adequate resources -- including such things as gender-equitable
materials, curriculum aligned with national content standards,
and anything else NESIC deems appropriate.
<p>
<li>OTL standards are measuring sticks for schools and teachers,
not for students. They are not a reliable method for improving
student achievement. Indeed, numerous studies linking dramatically
increased spending and declining test scores indicate that spending
does not drive academic success.[4]
<p>
<li>OTL standards invite further federal intrusion in American
education. Diane Ravitch, an assistant secretary of education
in the Bush administration, wrote, &quot;[T]he new standards,
euphemistically called 'opportunity-to-learn' standards, would
permit Federal regulation of curriculum, textbooks, facilities
and instructional methods....The bill describes the Federal 'opportunity-to-learn'
standards as 'voluntary,' but litigation would quickly turn them
into mandates.&quot;[5]
</ul><p>
The idea of lawsuits and mandates is not an alarmist fabrication;
an Alabama state court recently declared the state school system
unconstitutional for not providing adequate education to its students.
The judge's 125-page opinion imposes OTL-type standards on the
state's schools.[6]
<p>
<center><h3>TITLE III -- STATE AND LOCAL EDUCATION<br>
SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENT</h3></center>
<p>
This title authorizes block grants to states and subgrants to
local school boards [Sec. 309(a)].
<p><ul>
<li>In order to receive a grant under Goals 2000, a state is
obligated to adhere to the federal outline for reform: opportunity-to-learn
standards, content and performance standards, assessments, etc.
State improvement plans must be approved by the Secretary of Education.
Never before have states had to submit such lesson plans to the
federal government for approval. Contrary to the rhetoric of Goals
2000, this is not a formula for local authority over school reform;
it makes the word <I>voluntary</I> moot.
<p>
<li>In its grant application, a state must include &quot;an
assurance that State law provides adequate authority to carry
out each component of the State's improvement plan...&quot; [Sec.
305(a)(2)(B)]. In other words, the state must explain how it will
impose the Goals 2000 agenda on each of its school districts,
voiding the voluntary option for them as well.
<p>
<li>The Goals 2000 prescription for reform encourages states
to include plans to transform schools into &quot;one-stop shopping&quot;
centers which offer a variety of social services, including health
care and child care [Sec. 306(f)(2)]. This coordination of services
tends toward a collectivism which is contrary to our nation's
history as a free society. Concentrating the services in one place
and on one group of people may lead to a sense of dependency.
<p>
<li>Advancing social services, health care and related services
likely includes the promotion of school-based clinics (SBC). The
term &quot;coordinated services&quot; has been used by proponents
to refer to school-based clinics. These clinics commonly distribute
contraceptives and, when these measures fail, the clinics refer
for abortion.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE IV -- PARENTAL ASSISTANCE</h3></center>
<p>
This title provides for parental information and resource centers
and describes parental involvement in education. Laudable as it
sounds, this title is problematic:
<p><ul>
<li>Goal 8 (parental participation) and title IV (Parental
Assistance) assume that schools and parents have equal authority
over and responsibility for children. The legislation denies the
fact that parents' authority over their children is intrinsic
and that schools have only a delegated authority.
<p>
<li>To improve family life and help parents, Goals 2000 suggests
more programming, more meetings, more time at school and with
school personnel, and more home visits from professionals. All
of this leaves less time for parents and children to spend together.
<p>
<li>With their Goals 2000 grants, states must spend money on
&quot;parent education.&quot; Parents as Teachers (PAT), which
advocates home visits by counselors beginning at birth, is one
of the programs specifically endorsed by the law. Not only are
states encouraged to use their &quot;parent education&quot; money
to fund PAT programs, but the objectionable organization was directly
appropriated $10 million under Goals 2000 for FY 1995. The House
Education, Labor, HHS Subcommittee for Appropriations is to be
commended for targeting this program for termination. Its rationale
for proposing cuts to parent education programs is that &quot;these
are the very paternalistic and 'government knows best' programs
that the American people rejected last year.&quot;
<p>
<li>Publicly-funded institutions like PAT are not equipped
to improve families because they cannot speak to the values issues
inherent in the breakdown of families. Private voluntary associations
and individuals must take responsibility in this arena.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE V -- NATIONAL SKILL STANDARDS BOARD</h3></center>
<p>
Title V is devoted to linking education to business and industry.
It authorizes the creation of another national bureaucracy: the
National Skill Standards Board (NSSB). NSSB will establish business-education
partnerships and oversee development of skill standards and assessments.
<p><ul>
<li>The $3 million spent in 1994 to develop skill standards
is another misguided appropriation of funds. It also calls for
the development of national assessments to certify achievement
of the skill standards. These additions, however, will not produce
better candidates for business. According to a <I>Chicago Tribune</I>
article, employers seek critical thinking and creativity, but
when it comes to promoting those skills, &quot;most of the visible
school reform efforts, such as uniform national testing schemes,
head 180 degrees in the wrong direction.&quot;[7]
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE VI -- INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM</h3></center>
<p>
Title VI calls for evaluation of foreign education systems. It
also sets up a program of education personnel exchange with central
and eastern European countries and any country formerly a part
of the Soviet Union.
<p><ul>
<li>The United States does not have the resources to &quot;provide
Department of Education personnel and technical experts to assist
eligible countries to establish and implement a database or other
effective methods to improve educational delivery systems, structure
and organization&quot; [Sec. 601(c)(5)]. Moreover, U.S. envoys
should not be pushing the Goals 2000 agenda, unproven in our own
country, on eastern European countries.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE VII -- SAFE SCHOOLS</h3></center>
<p>
This title provides grants to local school districts to achieve
safe and drug-free schools. Section 705 describes types of programs
to be implemented to prevent violence.
<p><ul>
<li>Conflict resolution, anger management, and peer mediation
are cited as &quot;programs of demonstrated effectiveness in addressing
violence&quot; (Sec. 705). In reality, experts are skeptical of
these soft-approach violence prevention programs.[8]
<p>
<li>We cannot afford to spend millions on a violence prevention
strategy that includes programs of no proven effectiveness. Serious
efforts must be made to curb violence, but conflict resolution
and peer mediation will not get to the real solution: changed
lives and families.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE VIII -- MINORITY-FOCUSED CIVICS EDUCATION</h3></center>
<p>
This title provides grants for teacher seminars on minority-focused
civics and government.
<p><ul>
<li>Minority-focused courses will likely promote versions of
history similar to that produced by the Center for History in
the Schools in its <I>National Standards for United States History.
</I>Such politicization of history will not produce acculturation
but cultural friction and fragmentation.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE IX -- EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND IMPROVEMENT</h3></center>
<p>
Title IX makes organizational changes in the Department of Education's
Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI); prescribes
OERI's functions in relation to Goals 2000; establishes within
OERI a National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board,
five National Research Institutes, and a National Education Dissemination
System linking federal and local agencies. It also authorizes
expansion of research grants for comprehensive school health education
(Sec. 971).
<p><ul>
<li>Once again, Goals 2000 aims to improve education by adding
and reshuffling bureaucracy.
<p>
<li>Health education, which includes sex education, has already
been a major source of grief to parents. Advancing these programs
will undoubtedly lead to an increase in challenges to parental
authority.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE X -- MISCELLANEOUS</h3></center>
<p>
This catch-all title contains a gun-free school act, a non-smoking
policy for children's services in schools, a policy for distribution
of contraceptive devices, and authorization of grants for Midnight
Basketball programs.
<p><ul>
<li>The Goals 2000 policy on contraceptive devices further
marginalizes parents. Section 1018 states that &quot;all federally
funded programs which provide for the distribution of contraceptive
devices to unemancipated minors [shall] develop procedures to
encourage, <B>to the extent practical</B>, family participation
in such programs&quot; (emphasis added). How unlikely is it that
a school administrator will find it impractical to listen to parental
objections to a condom distribution policy?
<p>
<li>Midnight Basketball was originally a private sector plan.
There is no need for government to get involved in these charitable
efforts and regulate them to death.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
The Goals 2000 restructuring agenda will continue to spread like
kudzu throughout America as long as states receive Goals 2000
grants requiring them to submit their standards and assessments
for federal approval. Furthermore, zero-funding the Goals 2000
programs individually leaves open the possibility of future funding.
Complete repeal of Goals 2000 is the only solution.
<p>
Education reform calls for a reduction in the role of the federal
government in the system and a return to the traditional role
of school: teaching students basics like reading, writing, and
arithmetic. A decisive first step will be the repeal of Goals
2000, which subverts education reform with more federal regulation
and spending.

<H2>IS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT<BR>
THROWING FIRST COURT<BR>
TEST OF MILITARY'S HOMOSEXUAL<BR>
LAW?</H2>

<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</I></CENTER>
<P>
The Justice Department appears to be throwing a key military homosexual
case by not calling expert witnesses to rebut the half-truths
presented by pro-homosexual witnesses like former Assistant Secretary
of Defense Lawrence J. Korb.
<P>
Six avowed homosexuals are contesting the military's homosexual
law in a Brooklyn federal district court case, <I>Abel et al.
v. William Perry</I>.  This is the first federal case challenging
the military's new law.  Plaintiffs allege that the military ban
violates equal protection and free speech rights and imposes punitive
rules unrelated to fitness and ability to serve.[1]
<P>
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund and the American Civil
Liberties Union are representing the homosexual servicemembers.
 They called six &quot;expert&quot; witnesses to refute the military's
constitutional right to exclude homosexuals.  Not one of those
witnesses was countered by expert defenders of the ban.[2]
<P>
The law is on solid constitutional ground.  Congress has the constitutional
responsibility for writing personnel laws for the military: Article
I, Section 8.  Congress conducted extensive hearings in both the
Senate and the House in 1993.  It then codified the military's
policy banning homosexuals, and President Clinton signed it into
law on November 30, 1993.  The law took effect on February 28,
1994.
<P>
Mr. Korb, who testified on March 16, is an apologist for homosexual
causes who now works for the Brookings Institute.  In the past,
he frequently has relied on a discredited study from the Defense
Personnel Security Research and Education Center (PERSEREC), which
contains much sloppy research and misinformation.
<P>
Some of Korb's statements on the topic deserve closer examination:
<P>
<LI><I>Army Times</I>, February 17, 1992.  Korb states: &quot; [PERSEREC]
 completed two 
studies that concluded: <I>Homosexuals are better prospective
military members than heterosexuals</I>; the Pentagon should engage
in empirical research to see if they can function appropriately
in military units; and the Pentagon should make judgments about
individuals based on conduct, not sexual orientation.&quot;
There is no evidence that &quot;homosexuals are better&quot; soldiers,
and the Pentagon's 1993 studies found conclusively that homosexuals
are a high-risk category of potential recruits. 
<P>
<LI><I>CNN</I>, &quot;Larry King Live,&quot; July 27, 1993.  Korb
said, &quot;[A]ccording to the Pentagon's own studies done out
in Monterey, <I>approximately 200,000 people in the military are
homosexuals.  So you're talking about 10 percent of the force</I>.&quot;
<P>
The cited &quot;studies&quot; relied on the discredited work of
sex researcher Alfred C. Kinsey.  They exaggerate Kinsey's already
overblown findings of sexual deviance in the general population,
including the now-refuted 10 percent myth for homosexuality. 
Even Planned Parenthood, <I>The New Republic</I> and <I>Newsweek</I>
concede as much.  More reliable surveys indicate that the homosexual
population in America is less than two percent.
<P>
<LI> Testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, March
31, 1993.  Korb testified, &quot;Professor Theodore Sarbin, co-author
of a 1991 PERSEREC study for the U.S. military, has stated that
<I>there is no data linking gays to lower morale or cohesion</I>.
 Rather he (Sarbin) noted that where there's good leadership,
there's high morale.&quot;
<P>
This statement is without foundation.  PERSEREC omits any reference
to any scientific study of military unit cohesion and discipline
and their effect on combat readiness.  
<P>
The Pentagon's 1993 task force that studied the issue of homosexuals
in the military found hundreds of cases where servicemembers discovered
to be homosexual were very disruptive.  Mr. Korb's anecdotal account
is disputed by these cases.
<P>
A survey by the American Security Council Foundation found that
99 percent of active duty officers said homosexuals would undermine
the cohesiveness and readiness of combat units.[3] The Defense Readiness
Council compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[4]
<P>
<LI>Testimony in the 1994 case of <I>Margarethe Cammermeyer v. Les
Aspin</I>.  Korb told that court: &quot;The policy was never intended
to authorize the military to discharge someone simply based on
his or her status -- absent any evidence of conduct.  To the contrary,
conduct was the real focus of the policy....A servicemember's
own admission of being gay -- absent any indication of her propensity
to engage in homosexual conduct -- is simply not sufficient grounds
for discharging her under the existing policy....The policy I
authorized should not be construed as authorizing such an irrational
outcome.&quot;[5]
<P>
The military's pre-1993 ban was based on the principle that, &quot;Homosexuality is incompatible with military service.&quot;  Decades of court
rulings have affirmed the military's position that declaring oneself
a homosexual implies the person has or will engage in illegal
homosexual behavior.  
<P>
<LI>Testimony in the 1995 case of <I>Abel et al. v. William Perry</I>.
 Korb told the court, &quot;We were losing a lot of very good
people in whom the government had invested a lot of money.&quot;
 He also compared the homosexual exclusion with women in the military.
&quot;I can't over-emphasize the great opposition from military
leaders to ending the draft and bringing women into the services.&quot;
 Korb said he once shared a room with a homosexual without any
problem.
<P>
The military releases three times as many people each year for
drug abuse than it does for homosexuality.  And homosexuals in
the military have a bad record: as a group, they have a high ratio
of discipline problems and account for most of the AIDS cases.
<P>
Homosexual activists often try to compare their agenda with the
integration of blacks into the military.  Former chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell does not agree:  &quot;Skin
color is a benign, nonbehavioral characteristic.  Sexual orientation
is perhaps the most profound of human behavioral characteristics.
 Comparison of the two is a convenient but invalid argument.&quot;[6]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Justice Department and the Pentagon have many witnesses (active
duty and retired officers and civilians) who would refute the
half-truths presented by the pro-homosexual witnesses.  It is
inexplicable that in a politicized case like <I>Abel v. William
Perry,</I> the Justice Department failed to call experts to challenge
the misinformation promoted by homosexual groups.
<P>
The 104th Congress must demand that the Justice Department represent
the military's interests.  The evidence supports the military
homosexual law, but if the government is silent about the facts,
cases like this will be lost, and the destruction of military
morale will proceed unchecked.

<TITLE>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION SCUTTLES FIRST COURT TEST OF MILITARY'S HOMOSEXUAL LAW</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/insight/insight.gif">
<P>
<H2>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION<BR>
SCUTTLES FIRST COURT TEST OF<BR>
MILITARY'S HOMOSEXUAL LAW</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER><I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</I></CENTER>
<P>
In a lackluster performance, the Clinton Administration failed
to use key arguments and called no witnesses in the first court
test of the military's new homosexual law.  
<P>
On March 30, 1995, Judge Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District
of New York struck down parts of the military's new homosexual
law and the Pentagon's implementing directives in the case of
<I>Lieutenant Colonel Jane Able, et al. v. United States of America</I>.[1]
<P>
Judge Nickerson ruled that six service members' First and Fifth
Amendment rights were violated when the military sought to discharge
them solely based on their admissions of homosexuality.  He enjoined
the Pentagon from discharging the six, and the Justice Department
is expected to appeal the case to the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals.
<P>
This case follows a pattern seen in the Steffan, Meinhold, and
Cammermeyer cases whereby the government ignores key arguments
for prohibiting service by avowed homosexuals.  These cases demonstrate
fundamental differences between the law, which was signed by President
Clinton on November 30, 1993, and the Pentagon's implementing
directions, which took effect February 28, 1994.
<P>
Specifically, the Justice Department failed to:
<P><UL>
<LI>Call witnesses to represent the government's interest.  The
plaintiffs called six &quot;expert&quot; witnesses to dispute
long-held &quot;myths&quot; about homosexuals. 
<P>
<LI>Present well documented arguments for denying homosexual service
based on physical and psychological problems.
<P>
<LI>Demonstrate that the policy is conduct-based rather than status-based
as the plaintiffs argued.
<P>
<LI>Show that homosexual &quot;lifestyles&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
are contrary to the best interests of the armed services and present
serious morale and unit cohesion problems.
<P>
<LI>Refute a flawed study cited by the plaintiffs as evidence that
homosexuals will not damage morale and unit cohesion.
<P>
<LI>Demonstrate that homosexuals present a risk to the military
and therefore the military's ban is justified.  
</UL>
The judge noted key differences between the law and the directives:
<P><UL>
<LI>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and orientation
at the point of admission, the Clinton Administration has rejected
the questions.  The judge labeled this as unusual.  On one hand
the Pentagon encourages homosexuals to join (by not making homosexuality
part of a pre-induction litmus test) and then insists that the
homosexual remain secretive about his &quot;status.&quot;
<P>
<LI>The law denies service to homosexuals, but the directives permit
service to admitted homosexuals who can rebut the presumption
that they will engage in homosexual misconduct.  This creates
a status/conduct dichotomy.  The judge labels the rebuttable presumption
as &quot;Orwellian.&quot;
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>FIRST AMENDMENT ARGUMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The plaintiffs complain that the government violated their First
Amendment rights when it tried to discharge them for stating that
they are homosexual.  
<P>
The military law [10 U.S.C. 654(b)(2)] permits discharge when
&quot;the member has stated that he or she is a homosexual or
bisexual, or words to that effect, unless there is a further finding,
made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in the
regulations, that the member has demonstrated that he or she is
not a person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity
to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.&quot; 
The Pentagon's directives which implement this law [DoD Directive
1332.14 and 1332.30] have the same litmus test.
<P>
The government argued that this is not a First Amendment issue
because the law and the directives are directed solely at the
prohibition of acts and give members the opportunity to rebut
the presumption of misconduct.  However, the government failed
to show a nexus between a declaration of homosexuality and homosexual
misconduct.  In fact, government lawyers labeled much of the available
evidence as &quot;myths,&quot; thus aiding the plaintiffs.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> GOVERNMENT FAILED TO EXPLAIN RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HOMOSEXUALS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The judge noted that the government made no argument to exclude
homosexuals based on &quot;mental illness,&quot; security or infectious
diseases.  In fact, Justice Department lawyers dismissed these
well-founded arguments as &quot;myths.&quot;  Consider the facts.
<P>
<B>Homosexuals as a category present unacceptable risks.</B>
Research shows that homosexuals tend to be extremely promiscuous
and tend to have high incidences of sexually transmitted diseases,
especially the deadly AIDS virus.
<P>
Admitting homosexuals into the military violates the legal principle
of the assumption of risk.  This principle states that if you
know there is a risk and you assume it, then don't complain when
the risk materializes.  
<P>
A recent study from the University of Michigan found that people
with HIV are more capable of spreading the virus during the first
60 days of infection but that blood tests during this period do
not find the HIV antibodies.[2] This means that the military assumes
some risk, even though all personnel are initially tested, that
soldiers are not infected.  This is why screening out high-risk
groups and not just those who test positive for HIV is appropriate.
 Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration no longer screens out
homosexuals -- by far the highest risk group for contracting HIV.
<P>
The Army's Surgeon General, Lieutenant General Alcide Lanoue,
has addressed the health risks associated with homosexuals:[3]
<P><UL>
<LI>&quot;The military setting provides unique requirements for
safety in executing the Army blood transfusion program and for
preventing the transmission of blood-borne pathogens (especially
HIV and hepatitis B) in the field setting.  Homosexual males would
comprise a pool of ineligible blood donors and as a group are
at high risk of infection by HIV and hepatitis B, both significant
blood-borne pathogens which can infect other soldiers through
exposure to blood in peace and war.&quot; [During Operation Desert
Storm, there were five documented instances where blood was drawn
directly from soldiers and transfused.  In Somalia, five units
of blood were drawn from soldiers and directly transfused to Somalis.
 The urgency of such transfusions precludes testing for the AIDS
virus.]
<P>
<LI>&quot;HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Disease rates will
increase to the extent that the proportion of homosexual males
in the Army increases because homosexual/bisexual men are allowed
to enter and remain in the Army.&quot; [The CDC reports that most
of the AIDS patients in this country are homosexuals.[4] Homosexuals
account for a disproportionate number of America's most serious
STD's, including syphilis, gonorrhea, genital warts, and hepatitis
A and B.[5] Moreover, the 1994 homosexual sex survey in <I>The Advocate</I>,
a mainstream homosexual magazine, found that 13 percent of respondents
were HIV-positive and only 18 percent had taken all three shots
in the hepatitis B vaccine series.  <I>The Advocate</I> article
admits that, &quot;Gay men are one of the top risk groups for
being exposed to hepatitis B.[6]
<P>
<LI> &quot;A male homosexual soldier is significantly more likely
than a heterosexual soldier to be nondeployable for medical reasons
related to HIV infection.  If HIV-infected, the soldier will be
permanently nondeployable.  Male homosexuals are more likely to
acquire sexually transmitted diseases which can render them nondeployable,
such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and hepatitis B.
</UL>
&quot;Readiness from a medical standpoint will suffer if the restriction
is lifted.  The impact would be felt at the unit level, when the
homosexual soldier cannot train and deploy for health reasons.
 Likewise, the impact would be felt Army-wide in terms of the
military blood program and of the burden placed on the Army health
care system.&quot;
<P>
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homosexuals
are especially vulnerable to contracting HIV.  They are a high-risk
group because of co-factors associated with their lifestyle. 
These include recreational drug use, homosexual sex, malnutrition,
prior incidents of sexually transmitted diseases, and, most significantly,
sexual promiscuity.  
<P>
Homosexuals who participate in unsafe sex practices with multiple
partners and without taking precautions are at great risk of contracting
sexually transmitted diseases.  <I>The Advocate</I> survey found
that 72 percent of homosexual respondents engage in insertive
oral intercourse, 46 percent insertive anal intercourse, 45 percent
receptive anal-oral sex, 48 percent in three-way sex, 24 percent
in group sex (4 or more), and 10 percent in sadomasochism.[7] Most
of the homosexuals in the survey admitted to having had more than
30 sex partners over their lifetime, and more than a third (35%)
report more than 100 partners.  The survey also found that only
one time in four do homosexual men use condoms.[8]
<P>
Heterosexuals have fewer sex partners than homosexuals.  A 1988-1990
General Social Survey found that 91 percent of men 25 to 29 years
of age are heterosexually active.  Nineteen percent of these men
have had only one sex partner, 55 percent have had two to 19 partners,
and 25 percent have had 20 or more partners.[9]
<P>
The University of Chicago published a national sex survey in October,
1994, which found that 20 percent of men have had only one sex
partner in their lifetime, 21 percent have had two to four partners,
17 percent 5 to 10 partners, 16 percent 11 to 20 and 17 percent
report having had 21 or more sex partners.[10] However, that survey
excluded men over 59, who constitute one-sixth of the population
and who typically have had more conservative sex lives.  Thus
the real figures probably are even lower for the population of
all men.[11]
<P>
Homosexuality also increases medical costs.  With the ban in place,
openly homosexual inductees are turned away.  However, with the
ban lifted, a homosexual recruit could contract HIV within days
of induction or have early-stage HIV and not test positive and
be accorded full medical benefits for the rest of his life.  This
is about $120,000 in direct medical costs per AIDS patient.[12]
<P>
Dr. Edmund Tramont, Associate Director for retroviral research
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, published a 10-year projection
for HIV costs at $1.7 to $1.9 billion.[13] He warns that this is
in 1989 dollars, is based on the present rate of new cases and
assumes that only 60 percent of health care beneficiaries will
use the military health care system.  The potential 10-year cost
could rise to $5 billion if these assumptions are incorrect.[14]
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services indicates that
the lifetime cost of treating a person with AIDS -- from diagnosis
until death -- is $102,000.[15] The American Medical Association
estimated the per-person AIDS patient cost would rise to $386,000
by the year 2000 and $639,000 by the year 2008.[16]
<P>
As of April 1993 the military had dealt with 8,832 HIV-positive
service members.  Most have been separated, but at that time 1,580
were still on active duty.  Their status precluded them from deploying
overseas and necessitated special assignments and special medical
care.[17]
<P>
Homosexuals also have much shorter life expectancy than heterosexuals
as indicated by a study of more than 6,737 obituaries published
in <I>Omega: Journal of Death and Dying</I>.  The average age
of homosexuals who died from AIDS is 39; from all other causes
it is 42.[18]
<P>
Substance addiction and abuse represent the second key health
problems after AIDS in the homosexual subculture (with violence
the third).[19] A report by the National Lesbian-Gay Health Foundation
found that homosexuals -- men and women -- are about three times
as likely as heterosexuals to have an alcohol or drug abuse problem.[20]
<P>
While the 1992 GAO report states that the military spent $26 million
on homosexuals discharged,  it spent many times that figure treating
homosexuals with AIDS -- people who lied to enter the military
and now receive full health and pay benefits.  The cost-effective
decision would be to minimize the risk to the federal taxpayer
by rejecting homosexuals before they are recruited and discharging
those later discovered.
<P>
The 1992 GAO report also found that women are discharged for homosexuality
four times as often as men.  They are much more likely to be processed
under administrative discharge procedures than men.
<P>
Lesbians are also disruptive to unit morale and cohesion.  Pentagon
records include vignettes[21] such as the case of a female sergeant
who drank too much.  She approached four different women at a
base social club making sexually explicit remarks and grabbing
one woman's buttocks.  She was arrested on charges of indecent
assault.
<P>
A female veteran told her account of another female soldier who
made sexual advances in a barracks.  &quot;I was stuck in the
same barracks with that person for three months.  I had to get
up and look at that person every day.  She [the homosexual] insisted
on trying to find a mate in the barracks, and by the end of the
training, everyone has [sic] lost morale.&quot;
<P>
A female basic training soldier complained to her drill sergeant
that other female trainees were &quot;making out&quot; in a common
area.  The sergeant subsequently found seven female soldiers partially
dressed, embracing each other, holding hands, and kissing.  The
seven admitted they were lesbians and said that they were consenting
adults.  They stated they had not engaged in sexual activities,
and their lifestyle had nothing to do with being a good soldier.
<P>
A female air force veteran was assigned a lesbian roommate.  She
made strong sexual advances to the straight airwoman, so much
so that the airwoman left her room and slept on the floor in a
friend's barracks.
<P>
<B>The Justice Department ignored evidence showing that homosexuality
is a pathology.</B>  
<P>
Rather, contrary to long-established military precedence, the
government embraced the concept that homosexuality is normal or
at least of little consequence.  Labeling homosexuality as other
than a pathology is a serious mistake.
<P>
The military's World War II experience provided considerable insight
into human behavior.  Specialists in military medicine literally
rewrote the diagnostic codes and nomenclature for psychiatric
disorders.  Since 1945, the Army has consistently held that homosexuality
is a behavioral problem, not a mental disease.[22]
<P>
In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) Council approved
and published a new nomenclature for categorizing mental disorders
similar to those used by the military.[23] In the more than 40 years
since that time, the APA, under pressure from militant homosexual
groups, has progressively changed the nomenclature so as to remove
the negative connotations implicit in the terms &quot;sexual deviation&quot;
or &quot;pathology.&quot;
<P>
During its annual meetings from 1969 through 1971, the APA was
besieged by activists demanding the recognition of homosexual
behavior as normal.  In 1971, homosexual activists invaded the
annual meeting and denounced psychiatry as &quot;the enemy incarnate.&quot;[24]
<P>
In 1973, activists challenged the New England Psychiatric Society
to rename the section on &quot;sexual deviation&quot; to &quot;sexual
dysfunction.&quot;  Later that year, APA trustees ruled that homosexuality
would no longer be listed in its official nomenclature of mental
disorders but, rather, would be referred to as &quot;sexual orientation
disturbance.&quot;[25]
<P>
The revision of nomenclature continued when, in 1986, the last
remaining term, &quot;ego-dystonic homosexuality,&quot; was removed
from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders.
 This was done over the strong protest of many psychiatrists who
preferred to label homosexuality a long standing disturbance originating
in the early years of life.[26]
<P>
A survey of the American Medical Association membership in 1975
found that 69 percent agreed that homosexuality is &quot;pathological.&quot;[27]
 An argument used by those who promote homosexuality is that this
proclivity is inborn and irreversible.  Numerous psychotherapists,
including Elizabeth Moberly, Gerald van den Aardweg, Joseph Nicolosi,
Charles Socarides, and Masters and Johnson have reported significant
success in helping homosexuals to recover, thereby proving it
is a curable pathology.[28]
<P>
Despite considerable evidence of success in gender reparative
therapy, the APA, under pressure from gay activists, voted to
stop recommending efforts to turn unhappy homosexuals into heterosexuals.
 In December 1994, AMA's governing House of Delegates called for
a &quot;nonjudgmental recognition of sexual orientation by physicians.&quot;[29]
<P>
<B>The government ignored evidence that homosexuals are a security
risk by relying on a debunked government report which suggests
that homosexuals are no more at risk of blackmail than heterosexuals.</B>
<P>
The primary study comes from the Defense Personnel Security Research
and Education Center (PERSEREC), an agency of the Department of
Defense.[30] Although the report contains much sloppy research and
misinformation, it is frequently cited by one of the plaintiffs'
key witnesses in this case, former Assistant Secretary of Defense
Lawrence J. Korb.
<P>
Few people identify themselves as heterosexual; that identity
is assumed.  Homosexuals do, indeed, identify themselves, however.
<P>
Landmark research by Alan Bell and Martin Weinberg, <I>Homosexualities:
A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women</I>, found that a significant
number of homosexuals report that &quot;someone has threatened
[them with] exposure of homosexuality in order to get something
of value.&quot;[31]
<P>
If the threat of blackmail were the only problem with homosexuals
in the military, then lifting the prohibition might be justified.
 However, homosexuals should not serve for many reasons, and security
investigations are a valid mechanism for enforcing the law.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE SEES A STATUS V. CONDUCT DICHOTOMY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The legal fiction that an admission of homosexuality is not a
valid presumption of misconduct has long been dismissed by the
courts.  For many years, the military has won homosexual cases
because the courts recognize that people don't label themselves
homosexuals without some experience or intent to engage in the
defining behavior.  The Clinton Administration tried to finesse
this point in court but failed to persuade the judge, who labeled
the government's arguments as &quot;Orwellian.&quot;
<P>
Because the government failed to show a connection between a declaration
of homosexuality and misconduct, the judge understandably concluded
&quot;that the admission of homosexuals did not pose an uncontrollable
risk that they would commit acts inherently dangerous to morale,
good order, and discipline....&quot;
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE RELIES ON DEBUNKED STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The government argued that homosexuals create sexual tension in
single-gender organizations.  This tension undermines morale and
cohesion which are key to military readiness.
<P>
The plaintiffs dismiss this argument by citing a Rand Corporation
study which concludes &quot;although some disruptions might result
from having acknowledged homosexuals serving in the military....the
experience of analogous [non-military] organizations...suggests
that any increase is likely to be quite small.&quot;
<P>
In 1993, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin commissioned the Rand
Corporation to study lifting the military's homosexual ban.  The
Rand study cost $1.3 million and contains inaccurate or misleading
information and inappropriate parallels.
<P><UL>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites Rand's report on other countries, &quot;[N]o
serious problems were reported concerning the presence of homosexuals
in the force.&quot;
<P>
Rand ignored the June 1993 GAO report on &quot;Homosexuals in
the Military: Policies and Practices of Foreign Countries.&quot;[32]
 The GAO reviewed 25 countries and selected four countries for
detailed analysis.  The report states that 11 countries have policies
that do not permit homosexuals to serve in the military, 11 have
policies that do.  Three of the latter 11 countries do not have
any laws, regulations, or policies that address this issue.  An
unpublished Pentagon study conducted in December 1992 found that
some of those countries that permit homosexuals to serve do so
with strict limitations. 
<P>
Testimony before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees
(SASC and HASC) in April and May 1993 illustrates the dramatic
differences between foreign militaries and our own.  For example,
the Netherlands started a homosexual military experiment in 1974.
 That nation has 65,000 service members, including 40,000 conscripts
who serve 14 months and who primarily commute from home each day.
 The U.S. has 2.5 million active and reserve service personnel
stationed in the U.S. and around the world at any given time.
 The U.S. routinely participates in combat operations, something
the Dutch have not done for 50 years.      
The German armed forces, which are included among those that do
<I>not</I> have an exclusionary policy, will not induct acknowledged
homosexual volunteers because they would &quot;undermine military
order and discipline.&quot;[33] Of the 476,300 members, 43 percent
are conscripts who, if identified as homosexual, may be required
to undergo psychological tests to determine their fitness.  The
German Federal Administrative Court declared in November 1990
that the military is justified in not allowing homosexuals to
serve in leadership and educational positions.
<P>
Foreign social experiences have little relevance for America's
military.  The U.S. is a superpower with urgent missions worldwide.
 America also has a radical homosexual community and a liberal
judicial system, a combination that guarantees a steady stream
of legal activism that is disruptive to military morale.
<P>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites the 1992 GAO study on analogous organizations
which &quot;accepted homosexuals into their ranks...[and] have
generally not reported adverse impacts.&quot;
<P>
Rand's &quot;analogous organizations&quot; are fire and police
departments.  Researchers visited six cities and concluded that
homosexuals were integrated through clear and simple policies,
aggressive leadership and adherence to strict standards of conduct.
 The report prescribes the same approach for the military.
<P>
Rand ignores the important lessons from San Francisco Chief of
Police Anthony D. Ribera, who told the HASC on May 7, 1993 that
his department experiences a &quot;significantly higher&quot;
number of AIDS deaths among homosexual officers.  His department
routinely tests for Hepatitis B -- as demanded by the policemen's
union.  And they rely on local hospitals rather than other officers
for emergency blood.
<P>
San Francisco's officers also go home evenings or, as in the Seattle
Fire Department, occupy private cubicles when required to stay
overnight.  Additionally, homosexual officers serve primarily
in homosexual districts and, as in New York City, no one is forced
to pair up with a homosexual.  Chief Ribera concludes, &quot;Our
experience is remotely parallel to the military.&quot;
<P>
Sgt. Edward Striedinger of the Seattle Police Department told
the HASC about female officers who complained about advances from
lesbian officers.  These women refused to file formal complaints,
citing fear of reprisals. 
<P>
The parallels between paramilitary and military organizations
are mostly cosmetic, such as wearing side-arms and uniforms. 
The differences are pronounced but ignored in Rand's briefing.
<P>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites Rand's study on racial integration of
the services stating, integration &quot;did not 'destroy' unit
cohesion and military effectiveness.&quot;
<P>
Rand equates the evolving &quot;discriminatory&quot; homosexual
policy with the integration of blacks into the military.  General
Colin Powell has rejected the linkage: &quot;Skin color is [a]
benign, nonbehavioral characteristic.  Sexual orientation is perhaps
the most profound of human behavioral characteristics.  Comparison
of the two is a convenient but invalid argument.&quot;[34]
<P>
The Council of 100 (a national organization of African-American
Republicans founded in 1974) points out differences in the moral
and social climate in 1948 (when President Truman directed the
military to integrate), and the fact that blacks had honorably
and openly served since the Revolutionary War.  The Council said
that the homosexual discrimination argument is &quot;a disingenuous
strategy to divert attention from the real issues&quot; of readiness
and cohesion.[35]
<P>
The integration of avowed homosexuals brings into the military
services individuals whose behavior violates federal law.  The
integration of black Americans involved no behavioral assumptions.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>FIFTH AMENDMENT ARGUMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The government argued that heterosexual service members &quot;will
be upset by a co-worker's mere statement of homosexuality&quot;
and as a result refuse to work cooperatively.  The judge labels
this unjustified discrimination.
<P>
The government once again failed to present compelling evidence
that homosexual &quot;lifestyles&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
are incompatible with military service.
<P>
Consider the implications of homosexual service for military morale.
<P>
Morale means &quot;a strong sense of enthusiasm and dedication
to a commonly shared goal that unifies a group.&quot;  Heterosexual
soldiers forced to live and work with avowed homosexuals cannot
be expected to submit to sexual tension with &quot;...a strong
sense of enthusiasm.&quot;  
<P>
Open homosexuals tend to derive their basic identity from their
sexual orientation and practice: &quot;I am a homosexual,&quot;
as opposed to the American soldier's basic identity: &quot;I am
a soldier.&quot;  The homosexual's preoccupation with individual
behavioral characteristics is incongruent with and detracts from
the commonly shared goal -- accomplishment of the mission -- which
unifies heterosexual soldiers and subordinates their individual
goals to that of the group.
<P>
The homosexual subculture is recognized as &quot;liberated,&quot;
or in a manner of speaking, undisciplined.  This is inherently
at odds with the 24-hour discipline system within which soldiers
must live and work.  Homosexuals are distinguished from other
subcultures by their behavior [sodomy].  One group behavioral
characteristic is a very high rate of promiscuity.  Military records
indicate that homosexuals are statistically more likely to engage
in misconduct than heterosexuals.  They have a higher incidence
of drug and alcohol abuse than heterosexuals.  If these aren't
enough, much-touted books such as Randy Shilts' <I>Conduct Unbecoming</I>
and Mary Ann Humphrey's <I>My Country, My Right to Serve</I> provide,
perhaps unwittingly, ample testimony to the disruptive nature
of homosexuals in military units.[36]
<P>
The voice of experience indicates that homosexuals jeopardize
military morale.  For example, a survey of active duty officers
conducted for the American Security Council Foundation found that
99.03 percent said homosexuals would undermine the cohesiveness
and readiness of combat units.[37] The Defense Readiness Council
compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[38]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE MAKES NO MORAL DECISION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Judge Nickerson explained that his task &quot;is to determine
the constitutionality of the policy adopted by Congress, not its
morality.&quot;  He argues that everyone is &quot;entitled to
think it demeaning and unworthy of a great nation to base a policy
on pretense rather than on truth.&quot;
<P>
The judge suggests that constitutionality and morality may not
agree in this case, but many soldiers think this is clearly a
morality issue.  And requiring soldiers to &quot;tolerate&quot;
homosexuality will lead to recruitment and retention problems.
 The <I>Los Angeles Times</I> survey found that 46 percent of
soldiers said lifting the ban would enter into their reenlistment
decision and 11 percent would not reenlist because of it.  A February
1993 <I>CNN/Gallup Poll</I> found that, among men who had not
attended college, the prime recruiting population, 74 percent
opposed lifting the ban.  
<P>
The judge's labeling this a &quot;pretense&quot; is based on the
Clinton Administration's decision to stop asking recruits whether
they are homosexual.  Asking the question keeps honest homosexuals
out and sends a clear message that to serve, others must keep
their homosexuality a secret.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
It is expected that the Supreme Court will hear this case by 1997.
 As long as the government permits homosexuals to serve and as
long as the Clinton Administration's implementing directives flout
the law, however, the outcome is in doubt.
<P>
The 104th Congress must take legislative action to stop the evasion
of reality.  The Clinton Administration should be required to
abide by the law and the Justice Department must defend the law
using longstanding and successful arguments.

<TITLE>ACCREDITATION COUNCIL MANDATES ABORTION TRAINING </TITLE>

MANDATES ABORTION TRAINING</H2>

<P>
On February 14, 1995, the 23-member Accreditation Council for
Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) voted unanimously to pass new
regulations mandating that all medical residents specializing
in obstetrics and gynecology be trained to perform elective abortions.
 Individual residents expressing moral or religious objections
would be able to opt out of the abortion training.  However, medical
institutions opposed to abortion, such as Catholic hospitals,
would still be required -- in order to maintain their accredited
status -- to provide their students with abortion training by
arranging for their students to receive such training at another
location.
<P>
The wording of the new requirement is as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Experience with induced abortion must be part of residency
education, except for residents with moral or religious objections.
 This education can be provided outside the institution.  Experience
with management of complications of abortion must be provided
to all residents.  If a residency program has a religious, moral
or legal restriction which prohibits the residents from performing
abortions within the institution, the program must ensure that
the residents receive a satisfactory education and experience
managing the complications of abortion.  Furthermore, such residency
programs must have mechanisms which ensure that residents in their
program who do not have a religious or moral objection receive
education and experience in performing abortion at another institution.&quot;[1]
<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
Programs which fail to comply with the new regulations risk losing
their accreditation.  Accreditation status qualifies teaching
hospitals to receive federal reimbursement for services which
medical residents provide to patients.  Moreover, doctors must
ordinarily graduate from accredited training programs to get certified
as competent in their specialties.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DECLINE IN ABORTION PROVIDERS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Over the last twenty years, the number of medical schools offering
elective abortion training to their residents has declined.  In
1976, 92.5 percent of U.S. 
medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training, either
on a routine (26.3 percent) or optional basis (66.2 percent).
 This contrasts with 1991 figures in which 68.8 percent of medical
schools offered first-trimester abortion training -- 12.4 percent
on a routine basis, 56.4 percent on an optional basis.[2] Second-trimester
abortion training is only slightly less common than first-trimester
training programs (65.4 percent vs. 68.8 percent respectively),
but fewer medical schools routinely offer second-trimester abortion
training (6.7 percent); more provide optional training (58.7 percent).[3]
<P>
About one third of medical schools refuse to provide abortion
training due to moral and/or legal reasons.  For example, Catholic-affiliated
hospitals -- which make up about 20 percent of all U.S. hospitals
-- do not perform elective abortions because of religious and
moral beliefs.[4] Other hospitals, such as the publicly financed
Truman Medical Center in Missouri, are legally prohibited from
performing abortions because laws in several states -- including
Missouri -- bar the use of taxpayer money to fund abortions.[5]
<P>
In addition to the declining number of medical schools which provide
abortion training, fewer physicians are willing to perform abortions.
 A Columbia University survey found that nearly half of the ob/gyn
chief residents graduating each year have never performed a first-trimester
abortion.[6]
<P>
Overall, the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) reports that the
number of hospitals, clinics, and physicians' offices that provide
abortions -- 2,380 in 1992 -- has been declining at a rate of
about 65 a year.  Most of the decline can be attributed to hospitals;
the number of hospitals providing abortions decreased by 18 percent
between 1988 and 1992.[7]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ENSURING THAT WOMEN HAVE A CHOICE?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Proponents of ACGME's new regulations such as the National Abortion
Federation, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the
Feminist Majority Foundation, the Center for Reproductive Law
and Policy, and the current leadership of the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) point to the decline
in abortion providers as justification for the mandate.  They
emphasize that unless the procedure is required, many ob/gyn students
will choose to opt out of abortion training, thereby decreasing
access to abortion.
<P>
Abortion advocacy groups hope the ACGME mandate will help bring
abortion back into the &quot;mainstream&quot; of ob/gyn practice.
 Currently, the vast majority of abortions are performed in clinics,
isolating abortion from the general practice of medicine.  Abortionists
also say they frequently feel less respected by their colleagues
and society in general.  By including abortion as a necessary
ob/gyn service, abortion proponents hope to remove the taint associated
with abortion and also reduce the targeting of clinics by abortion
protesters.
<P>
Finally, the ACGME cited patient safety as a reason to require
abortion training.  Dr. John C. Gienapp, Ph.D., executive director
of ACGME, said, &quot;Those physicians who choose to develop appropriate
medical skills in the area of abortion must be trained adequately.&quot;[8]
 The American Medical Association agreed, saying in a statement,
&quot;For the safety of patients, it is essential that physicians
providing abortion services are trained and competent.&quot;[9]
<P>
While the new regulations will not go into effect until January
1, 1996, abortion advocacy groups as well as several medical societies
-- including ACOG -- have lobbied the ACGME for over a year to
adopt such a policy change.[10]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>OR REMOVING CHOICE FROM OB/GYN PHYSICIANS?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
ACGME's new abortion mandate has received considerable opposition
-- from pro-life groups to many within the medical establishment.
 &quot;Pro-choice&quot; physician James Schreiber, M.D., chief
of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University Medical
Center in St. Louis, denounced the new policy as coercive and
&quot;anti-choice,&quot; saying that institutions with moral objections
were &quot;being forced into an untenable position.&quot;[11]
<P>
Richard T. F. Schmidt, M.D., a former ACOG president (1977-1978)
and residency review committee member, also questions the rationale
behind the abortion training mandate.  In a letter to ACGME's
ob/gyn residency review committee, Dr. Schmidt wrote, &quot;Is
there a demonstrated lack of knowledge or technical competence
among program graduates?  Or is the purpose to make more residents
comfortable with the <I>idea</I> of elective abortion and its
performance?&quot;  Commenting on the diminishing number of programs
offering elective abortion training, Dr. Schmidt said that given
a choice, faculty and residents &quot;voted very clearly with
their feet.&quot;[12]
<P>
The Christian Medical and Dental Society (CMDS), the American
Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, and other pro-life and pro-family
groups have also registered their strong opposition to the new
mandate.  These groups argue that requiring residents to undergo
abortion training will have the effect of dissuading many pro-life
medical students from choosing to specialize in ob/gyn.  These
groups also believe that residents will receive intense pressure
from within the medical school to undergo abortion training due
to the accreditation requirement.[13]
<P>
The fears these groups express may well be justified.  An editorial
published in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> indicates
that ob/gyn residents will receive considerable pressure to undergo
elective abortion training.  The author of the editorial, an advocate
of the new ACGME requirements, writes that &quot;[r]esidents who
wish to opt out of abortion training should be required to explain
why in a way that satisfies <I>stringent</I> and <I>explicit</I>
criteria&quot; (emphasis added).[14]  Furthermore, two years ago the
University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill
found that greater numbers of residents were refusing to perform
abortions even though the school provided training.  As a result,
the school sent a letter to all prospective residents in the summer
of 1993 saying that it would accept only candidates who agreed
to perform abortions.  The policy was rescinded after threats
of a class-action lawsuit.[15]
<P>
The North Carolina scenario demonstrates that ACGME's new policies
were not passed in response to ob/gyn residents who wanted to
receive abortion training but were unable to receive it.  Such
a conclusion is also supported by a recently released survey by
the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a
recognized special interest group within the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).  With almost 25 percent
of the 36,000 ACOG members responding, the survey found that 59
percent of respondents felt that abortion training should <U>not</U>
be required in residency programs.[16]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>IMPACTS OF THE ABORTION TRAINING MANDATE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
ACGME's new requirements seem to be implicitly directed at teaching
residents to perform second- and third-trimester abortions.  As
Congressman and family physician/obstetrician Tom Coburn (R-OK)
has testified, medical residents already receive training in handling
spontaneous abortions (miscarriages) through dilation and curettage
(D &amp; C), which is the usual technique used for first-trimester
abortions.  Only later-term abortions require additional training
in special techniques to &quot;terminate the pregnancy.&quot;[17]
<P>
The new policy would also require teaching hospitals to provide
or obtain additional facilities, equipment, and faculty (or contract
with other institutions to do so).  Furthermore, hospitals which
have not historically referred patients for abortions because
of moral reasons and which refuse to provide abortion training
on-site would nonetheless be forced to violate their fundamental
beliefs and directly collaborate with abortion providers.  The
mandate also violates laws in roughly half the states that exempt
hospitals from referring for abortion, contraception, or sterilization
when the hospital is conscientiously opposed.
<P>
Because the abortion training mandate does conflict with several
states' laws, it can also be reasonably expected that Planned
Parenthood and other abortion providers will file lawsuits to
change the laws which (1) exempt hospitals from referring for
abortion, and (2) explicitly ban the use of taxpayer monies to
fund abortions in publicly-funded hospitals.

<I>Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</I></CENTER>
<P>
The forced feminization of the Navy is undermining combat readiness
and Congress must exercise its Constitutional responsibility to
examine these politically motivated changes before more damage
is done.
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry promised, &quot;Our over-arching
goal is to maintain a high-quality, ready and effective force.
 By increasing the numbers of units and positions to which women
can be assigned, the military services gain greater flexibility
in the development and use of human resources.&quot;[1] 
<P>
Unfortunately, Mr. Perry has set a course to feminize the Navy
without regard for military necessity.  Today, 94 percent of Navy
billets, including previously exempt combat positions, are open
to women.  Secretary Perry promotes these changes as &quot;equal
opportunity.&quot;[2]
<P>
Consider factors that seriously impair Navy readiness.
<P><UL>
<LI>A Navy study found that women are NOT physically equipped to
perform most at-sea emergency tasks.
<P>
<LI>A 1995 Navy policy embraces pregnancy as an acceptable readiness
problem in spite of the fact that almost half of pregnant sailors
never return to their crews after delivery.
<P>
<LI>Fraternization is a growing problem among crew members aboard
mixed-gender ships and this contributes to serious morale and
cohesion problems at sea.  It also has a negative effect on the
well-being of military spouses back home.
<P>
<LI>The Navy has ignored longstanding screening standards in order
to accelerate less qualified women into positions, thus bypassing
more experienced men.
<P>
<LI>Sexual harassment charges are a favorite tool of some women
who manipulate Navy leaders to promote personal agendas.
<P>
<LI>The Defense Department has promised to raise the percentage
of female servicemembers to perhaps 25 percent of the total force.[3]
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>STUDY SAYS WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Navy has ignored key findings which demonstrate that women
are less equipped physically to perform assignments aboard combat ships.
 The Navy Personnel Research and Development Center in San Diego,
California, conducted a comprehensive study of 350 men and 195
women to determine what effect training had on their physical
performances.  The study measured performance on five basic damage
control tasks: carrying litters on level surfaces and up and down
ladders, moving and starting emergency pumps, turning engine bolts,
and directing fire hose streams.  Virtually all male recruits
were able to perform all of the tasks before training, while women
could perform only one of the tasks to a satisfactory standard.[4]
<P>
Even after significant training, women showed no appreciable improvement.
 The study found that the differences between the sexes on measures
of lifting strength and aerobic capacity are dramatic.  
<P>
All naval crewmembers must be prepared to perform damage control
assignments.  Lack of physical strength among female sailors can
decrease survivability.  For example, had more women been aboard
the <I>USS Stark</I>, crippled by an Iraqi missile in the Persian
Gulf, the loss of life and property would very likely have been
greater.
<P>
Analogous organization experiences show similar trends.  Civilian
fire departments have reported disproportionate differences between
the sexes in injury rates when women are expected to perform like
men.  They suffer up to three times as many disabling back injuries
as men.[5] Women suffer more injuries because to lift the same load
as men, they must operate near their maximum lifting capacity,
e.g., a male medic carrying a litter uses on the average half
of his lifting power, but a woman uses on average her full lifting
capacity.
<P>
The 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in
the Armed Forces found that women's aerobic capacity is significantly
lower, meaning they cannot carry as much as far as fast as men.
 Despite the existence of an exceedingly small number of Amazonian
women who resemble men in muscular mass, on average, women are
shorter, have less muscle mass and weigh less than men.  This
puts them at a distinct disadvantage when performing tasks requiring
a high level of muscular strength and aerobic capacity.[6]
<P>
The Commission also found that women are at a higher risk for
exercise-induced injuries than men, with 2.13 times greater risk
for lower extremity injuries, and 4.71 times greater risk for
stress fractures.[7]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PREGNANCY POLICY HURTS READINESS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Navy's 1995 pregnancy policy ignores readiness while favoring
protection of individuals' rights.  As the number of women in
the Navy increases, pregnancy becomes a serious readiness issue.
<P>
At any given time, up to 18 percent of Navy women are pregnant
and a study of two ships showed a pregnancy rate as high as one
in three.[8] That's nearly 8,423 women or enough to crew almost
two aircraft carriers.  During Desert Storm 1,145 women on ships
needed to be reassigned because of pregnancies, at an average
of 95 per month.[9]
<P>
According to the policy, a woman may serve aboard ship until she
is 20 weeks pregnant.  While aboard ship, she must never be more
than six hours from emergency OB/GYN care.  Perhaps this provision
exists because at least five babies have been born on Navy ships,
one of which died shortly after birth.  Obviously, this policy
limits the pregnant sailor's deployability and her job performance
is frequently limited.
<P>
On average, each pregnancy taken to term removes a female sailor
from her ship for at least six months.  Once the child is born,
the sailor receives six weeks of convalescent leave and is not
required to re-deploy for four months.  That period can be extended
by the attending physician.  Many women never return to their
ship after giving birth.  According to Navy records, 35 percent
leave the Navy and eight percent remain on shore.    
<P>
Those who do return are unable to devote full time to their infant,
often creating an unhealthy reliance on child care at an extremely
impressionable age for the child.  Extended care for children
during frequent deployments denies the child the nurturing that
is key to a balanced emotional composition.   
<P>
According to Jay Belsky writing in the <I>Journal of Marriage
and the Family</I>, children left in child care while mothers
work &quot;scored more poorly on a composite measure of adjustment
than did children whose mothers were not employed during their
first three years....[and they] were significantly more noncompliant
than agemates without such early experience.&quot;[10]  These problems
are made worse as the mother-child separations are longer and
more frequent.
<P>
According to the Defense Manpower Data Center, two thirds of all
uniformed female mothers of one child have never married.  There
are never-married servicemembers with as many as nine dependents.
 Today, there are 84,831 never-married female active duty members
from all services with at least one child.[11]
<P>
Unmarried female servicemembers with at-home dependents are eligible
for benefits identical to married members.  For example, they
receive larger government quarters (more children means more bedrooms),
larger allowances driven by family size (such as cost of living
allowances), government-subsidized child care and medical care.
 During each pregnancy the servicemember is provided all pay and
allowances, time off and free medical benefits.
<P>
If a pregnant sailor wants an abortion she must be transported
off the ship to a location near an abortion clinic.  Before this
happens Navy personnel must counsel her about her options.  If
she chooses abortion, she is given, at government expense, a complete
blood count (CBC) to determine whether to administer Rhogam to
prevent an immune reaction.  After the abortion, the Navy provides
medical attention for problems arising from the procedure, like
clinical depression or an incomplete abortion.  The costs for
this treatment are borne by the Navy.
<P>
Navy policy prohibits supervisors from taking action against a
woman who becomes pregnant during a deployment, and there is no
requirement for women to use birth control during deployments.
 One command did, however, send a message to all ship captains
directing them to counsel their female sailors about the advantages
of NORPLANT, the under-the-skin birth control device.[12] 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SEX TAKES PLACE AFLOAT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Two sailors aboard the <I>USS Eisenhower</I> were recently punished
for having sex, videotaping the event and then showing it to fellow
sailors.  The sailors were charged with adultery, since each of
them was married to someone else.  The incident shows that mixing
men and women in close quarters for extended periods can lead
to misconduct, and it has serious implications for morale.
<P>
The number of pregnancies aboard the USS Eisenhower, the first
combat vessel with female crewmembers, grew from five to 39 in
a couple months.  In all, 13 percent of the female crew became
pregnant.  By comparison, less than four percent of the male crewmembers
left the <I>Eisenhower</I> for medical reasons since April 1994.[13]
<P>
An active duty Naval officer with recent at-sea experience supervising
female sailors claims that every ship has &quot;large numbers
of pregnancies.&quot;  This officer alleges that advancement in
the Navy depends on supporting the &quot;vital program of women
at sea&quot; and he is &quot;not sure the Navy [has] thought through
the pregnancy issue.&quot;[14]
<P>
A seasoned chief petty officer who recently supervised women aboard
ship alleges that many women &quot;get pregnant to avoid deployment.&quot;
 He believes that many &quot;Generation X&quot; women are in the
Navy for financial gain, the education and to find a husband.
 Sex aboard ship is common.  As a supervisor who wouldn't tolerate
sexual liaisons among crewmembers,  he claims that his disapproving
female subordinates were very uncooperative with him due to his
lack of tolerance of their fraternization.
<P>
The chief alleges that many of his female subordinates were untrained
prior to a recent deployment because they had only been recently
reassigned to the crew.  They were replacing other females who
&quot;got pregnant at the last minute.&quot;  It is difficult
to replace women with men, because ships are now configured to
accommodate a specified number of billets for each sex. 
<P>
Apart from the immediate shipboard impact, the policy hurts family
members who stay ashore and worry about the sexual climate to
which their spouses are being subjected.  An officer's wife recently
wrote about sexual tensions in Haiti.  Two men shared a tent with
a female officer who &quot;made it known that she was open to
intimate relationships.&quot;  The male officer indicated the
situation made him &quot;uncomfortable and awkward&quot; and it
&quot;was to him professionally and personally&quot; distressing.
 He had recently married and his wife was pregnant with their
first child.[15] Military wives often worry about the prospects that
their husbands might be sexually preyed upon by women willing
to use sex for personal gain.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>AFFIRMATIVE ACTION COMES ABOARD</H3></CENTER>
<P>
There is growing anecdotal evidence that shows that female sailors
get special treatment.  Consider several incidents.
<P>
A female sailor aboard the <I>USS Eisenhower</I> was disciplined
for &quot;falling in love.&quot;  Her punishment was three days
on bread and water in a Navy brig.  Since the carrier has no female
jail, she was sent ashore to Rota, Spain via an Italian island,
Italy, Germany and finally Spain.  En route to Rota, she and her
two escorts shopped and dined their way for five days, all at
government expense.  She told the <I>Norfolk Virginian-Pilot and
Ledger-Star</I>, &quot;I was free to go.  We went out to eat,
to the shopping malls in Italy and we stayed in hotels.  It had
to be a huge expense.&quot;[16] Some &quot;punishment.&quot;
<P>
The 19-year-old claims she was the only female crewmember disciplined
for breaking the captain's no-dating policy and alleges other
women were found &quot;with their boyfriends kissing in closets
and other hideaways aboard ship.&quot;[17]
<P>
Tragedies which involve Navy women have also been handled in an
unusual fashion.  The fatal crash of an F-14A Tomcat fighter on
October 25, 1994 is revealing.  In an unprecedented move, the
Navy released Lieutenant Kara S. Hultgreen's training records
to the media and her mother, Sally Spears.  It also went to great
lengths to recover the aircraft from the ocean floor.  Finally,
it released a video showing Hultgreen's last carrier approach.
<P>
Although initial reports blamed a failed engine for the crash,
on March 14, 1995, the Mishap Investigation Report (MIR) contained
&quot;...repeated instances of pilot error.  It notes the role
of engine trouble but concludes that Hultgreen's flight-control
mistakes were the most critical factors [in the accident].&quot;[18]
 The MIR, written to exacting standards, is classified as &quot;privileged&quot;
and is used for improving the safety of future flights.
<P>
On March 7, 1995 a female Navy pilot called a live national radio
show from the deck of the <I>USS Abraham Lincoln</I>, the same
carrier to which Hultgreen was assigned.  This F-18 pilot called
to promote women in combat aircraft.  She explained that the &quot;women
in the military&quot; debate is about &quot;equal opportunity&quot;
and as far as she is concerned there is &quot;no problem.&quot;[19]
<P>
In August 1994, a male Navy pilot told his boss that he objected
to women serving in combat, but would follow orders.  He now faces
dismissal for failing to &quot;demonstrate leadership&quot; despite
having received outstanding efficiency reports.[20]
<P>
Another male officer alleges that women are receiving preferential
treatment for command and promotions.  One female officer was
selected to become a ship's executive officer after only three
years of sea duty.  The more seasoned male officer explained that
the standard has long been no less than six to eight years of
sea duty before eligibility for this coveted assignment.  He also
cited the example of a female commander who was excused for hitting
a sea buoy, an act which is normally a career killer.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CHARGES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The 1991 Tailhook convention branded the Navy as a haven of sexual
harassers.  Even though much of the evidence is contradictory,
the Navy has suffered serious public relations damage.
<P>
In the wake of Tailhook, several key senior Navy leaders have
taken direct hits from women alleging sexual harassment.  Admiral
Stanley Arthur decided to drop a female lieutenant with poor flying
skills from helicopter aviation training.  The lieutenant claimed
that she had been eliminated from flight school because of &quot;retaliation&quot;
for filing a successful sexual harassment complaint.  The man
involved in the harassment charge was punished for making inappropriate
comments and has since left the Navy.
<P>
Adm. Arthur reviewed the lieutenant's record and found evidence
of poor aptitude and performance both before and after the harassment
incident.  He wrote: &quot;From this review I do not have sufficient
confidence that [the lieutenant] could safely and successfully
operate an aircraft in a dangerous and unforgiving operational
environment....I do not desire to see her or perhaps others die
because she could not perform at a level consistent with our standards.&quot;[21]
<P>
The admiral had been nominated to become Commander in Chief of
Naval Forces in the Pacific (CINCPAC).  After his decision, his
confirmation was procedurally shelved possibly because of threats
from congresswomen like Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-CO) who fought
the retirement status of outgoing Chief of Naval Operations Frank
B. Kelso II, who oversaw the Tailhook investigation.  The Navy
withdrew the Arthur nomination.
<P>
Tragically, Coast Guard Captain Ernest J. Blanchard IV took his
own life after learning of an investigation into remarks he allegedly
made at a dinner at the Coast Guard Academy on January 10, 1995.
 An officer who attended the dinner said, &quot;I heard the remark
that some of the things the speaker said would have been OK maybe
20 years ago....I guess they were jokes, off-color remarks, not
politically correct.  Some women in the humanities department
apparently complained about the comments.&quot;[22]
<P>
Blanchard, considered a rising star in the Coast Guard, wrote
a formal letter of apology to the &quot;offended&quot; woman,
but it was not accepted.  The female officer pressed her allegations.
 Blanchard offered to retire but permission was denied.  Friends
believe that he felt that his character was being assailed and
that he was being treated as an example by the Coast Guard.
<P>
In other instances, remarks by junior officers have met with charges
of sexual harassment.  For example, when a petty officer reported
that two of his subordinates were having a lesbian relationship,
the women responded by alleging sexual harassment.  The senior
chief was removed from the ship.
<P>
Another officer was removed for being a &quot;gender offender.&quot;
 The first words out of his boss's mouth were: &quot;You're guilty
of sexual harassment,&quot; a clear violation of the long tradition
of being held innocent until proven guilty.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Clinton Administration's decision to scuttle exemptions for
women and to embrace the feminization of the Navy has seriously
damaged readiness.  The 104th Congress should reverse the current
trend before irreparable harm is done to the U.S. Navy and the
defense posture of the nation.

<TITLE>THE FACTS ABOUT WELFARE AND ABORTION IN NEW JERSEY</TITLE>

WELFARE AND ABORTION<BR>
IN NEW JERSEY</H2>

<P>
<I>Jennifer E. Marshall</I></CENTER>
<P>
John Cardinal O'Connor of New York has defined two conditions
-- and two conditions only -- that justify opposing the anti-illegitimacy
measures recently adopted by the House.  His opposition hinges,
first, on the &quot;virtual inevitability&quot; that a freeze
on benefits &quot;amounts to a programmed 'short-term' increase
in abortions&quot; and, second, on the lack of &quot;any hard
evidence&quot; to support the contention that reducing illegitimacy
will reduce abortions.[1]
<P>
The Cardinal's principled objections deserve an answer, and all
people of faith should be relieved by the fact that we do have
hard evidence to allay both of his concerns.  Given the weight
of evidence suggesting that abortions will not increase in the
short term and will in fact decrease in the long term, those who
defend the status quo on moral or empirical grounds must now bear
the burden of proof.  And those who have been both puzzled and
troubled by the rift in the pro-life ranks over this issue must
understand that the division springs not from a different understanding
of our moral responsibilities, but from a different degree of
reliance on the actual empirical record.
<P>
While it is far too premature to draw any decisive conclusions
from the welfare experiment in New Jersey, there is absolutely
no statistical indication as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the state's family cap took effect August 1,
1993.  In fact, the total number of Medicaid-funded abortions
in New Jersey declined from 13,629 in 1993 to 13,424 in 1994.[2]
<P>
Because Medicaid data is collected by date of payment, rather
than procurement, the raw numbers do contain some distortion.
 Yet any Medicaid-funded abortion occurring within approximately
the first year after implementation of the cap is included in
the current data set.  While the 1994 numbers are still subject
to some adjustment to reflect the most recent abortions for which
no claim has yet been filed, the existing margin between the totals
for 1993 and 1994 can accommodate the anticipated inflation without
threatening the indication that abortions have not surged upward
as feared.
<P>
Likewise, the number of privately funded abortions performed on
welfare mothers
 is expected to be too negligible to affect the finding that abortions
have not significantly increased (especially since the average
cost of an abortion in New Jersey in 1993 was equal to eight times
the $64 amount by which the new policy reduces the benefits package
each month).  Although no hard data is available to address the
question, Susan Tew of the Alan Guttmacher Institute commented
that &quot;it logically does not make sense to suggest that women
who are in severe financial straits and are eligible for a publicly
funded abortion would forgo those Medicaid dollars in lieu of
scarce private resources.&quot;  No data is available, she noted,
precisely because the possibility that welfare women forgo available
public funding for the abortions they choose to have is too remote
to merit the expenditure of research dollars.[3] 
<P>
The only other significant objection to the use of Medicaid data
-- the only data we have at present -- is that the population
includes approximately 57,000 women (ages 16-45) who are eligible
for Medicaid, but are not subject to the Family Development Program
(FDP) in New Jersey that included the family cap.  The presence
of such a sizeable group of women who are not subject to the new
welfare policy could conceivably mask an increase in abortions;
but the fact that the non-FDP population remained virtually unchanged
between 1993 and 1994 suggests that there is no hidden increase
lurking in the short-run data.
<P>
Anita Leone, executive director of an association that represents
all the publicly-funded abortion clinics in New Jersey, confirmed
in a recent interview: &quot;We know that abortions in New Jersey
are currently decreasing.  We just don't know why.&quot;  Since
the decline in the birth rate among welfare mothers in New Jersey
has been rather substantial since implementation of the family
cap (estimates range at least as high as 11.4 percent[4]), the fact
that an increase in abortions is not yet indicated is significant.
<P>
The anecdotal evidence collected by those who are on the frontlines
of welfare reform in New Jersey confirms the general pattern that
is beginning to emerge from the data.  Richard Traynor of the
Legal Center for Defense of Life in New Jersey and David Sciarra
of New Jersey Legal Services, who together filed a class-action
suit over the New Jersey family cap, both commented in telephone
interviews that the class was certified to include welfare mothers
who had aborted their babies -- but that neither one could locate
a woman who had actually aborted in the wake of the cap.
<P>
Instead, the only plaintiffs who mention abortion in their affidavits
explain that they consciously decided on moral grounds not to
terminate their pregnancies, despite increased economic pressures.
 One woman testified that she made an appointment at an abortion
clinic but ultimately &quot;became very upset about having an
abortion and decided that [she] could not go through with it.&quot;
 Another woman who already had two children and was carrying triplets
-- three times the pressure -- never even considered abortion.[5]
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  And welfare mothers are apparently
more inclined to consider &quot;non-rational&quot; factors than
any other population group.  Public opinion data collected by
the Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more
morally repugnant to poor women;[6] and the fact that abortion rates
for teen welfare mothers are <I>lower</I> than national averages
for all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic
factors determine the decision to carry a child to term.[7]
<P>
Many who now argue otherwise are precisely the ones who maintain
that the current benefits level is already far too low to cover
the costs associated with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical
to predict that a cap would have a sufficiently significant impact
on the &quot;affordability&quot; of another child to trigger such
a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
State-by-state data from the 1980s demonstrates that small changes
in welfare payouts do not affect abortion rates in the short term;[8]
and Michael Schwartz of Life Advocacy Alliance has found in analyzing
more recent data that states with the highest average monthly
benefit for a family of three also tend to have the highest ratio
of abortions to live births.[9]
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, the only &quot;evidence&quot; the plaintiffs
could offer in the New Jersey suit was 55 letters from pro-life
activists expressing concern that freezing benefits might increase
abortions.  As of yet, there is nothing more concrete than their
concern itself to corroborate their claims; and pro-lifers who
are unconvinced by the hearsay -- including John Tomicki, past
president of New Jersey Right to Life -- have concluded that welfare
reform itself is a pro-life cause.
<P>
Contrary to Cardinal O'Connor's assertion, we do have compelling
statistical evidence to suggest that reducing illegitimacy will
reduce abortions.  Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation has
found an astronomically high correlation between abortion and
illegitimacy in a state-by-state analysis.  His study shows that
an increase of 100 in the number of illegitimate births per 10,000
women, in fact, results in an increase of 200 in the number of
abortions per 10,000 women.[10]
<P>
The vast majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women
-- and the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, we must
reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy that create
a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.  Marriage affords the
best protection -- indeed, the only real hope -- for the children
of the poor.
<P>
In deference to that fact, John Paul II wrote in his most recent
encyclical <I>Evangelium Vitae</I> that &quot;[a] general <I>and
no less serious </I>responsibility [for abortion] lies with those
who have encouraged the spread of an attitude of sexual permissiveness
and a lack of esteem for motherhood, and with those who should
have ensured -- but did not -- effective family and social policies
in support of families.&quot;[11]
<P>
The Pope's teaching leaves ample room for inferring that a program
that undermines families and promotes sexual immorality as effectively
as our current welfare system does is equally responsible for
abortion as permissive abortion laws.  Those who countenance the
status quo in welfare countenance a system rife with abortion.
 And those who fight for welfare reform wage a war against abortion
that is no less morally valid than peaceful sit-ins, prayer vigils,
and reform of law.

<TITLE>THE EVELYN HOOKER STUDY AND THE NORMALIZATION OF HOMOSEXUALITY</TITLE>

<H2>THE EVELYN HOOKER STUDY<BR>

<P>
Evelyn Hooker has been among the most influential figures in the
highly successful movement to convince the American people that
homosexuality is a &quot;normal variant&quot; of human sexual
behavior.  Her 1957 study, &quot;The Adjustment of the Male Overt
Homosexual&quot; (<I>Journal of Projective Techniques,</I> 1957,
21, 18-31) is the most frequently cited scientific source for
the argument that homosexuality is not a pathology, that homosexuals
are as free from mental disorder as heterosexuals.  
<P>
Such assertions have not only found their way into standard psychology
textbooks but have also provided a scientific basis for decisions
in major court cases involving the legality of state sodomy laws
and prohibitions against homosexual employment in certain state
and local agencies (e.g., schools, police departments).  Indeed,
when the American Psychiatric Association debated the issue of
homosexuality in 1973, Evelyn Hooker's work was Exhibit A for
those who wanted to remove homosexuality from the group's list
of mental disorders. 
<P>
For many commentators and activists, the Hooker study effectively
ended the debate over whether or not homosexuals were in any way
abnormal in their relationships with each other and with the community
at large.  Today many Americans have accepted the idea that homosexuality
is &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; without realizing
that such an opinion is derived in large measure from a single
study -- one conducted by a UCLA professor whose previous laboratory
subjects had been rats.  
<P>
In all this extravagant homage to Hooker and her study, several
points have escaped her admirers, to say nothing of the federal
courts: 
<P>
1. In her 1957 report, Evelyn Hooker did not use a random sample
to test the stability of homosexuals, but allowed gay rights activists
to recruit those homosexuals most likely to illustrate her thesis
that homosexuality is not a pathology.  Individuals who proved
unstable were deleted from the final sample.
<P>
2. Hooker's published account of how she recruited heterosexual
subjects is not consistent with a more detailed later account.
<P>
3. Six subjects in her study, three from each group, had engaged
in both homosexual and heterosexual behavior beyond adolescence.
<P>
4. Hooker made several errors in her mathematical calculations
that raise doubts about her care and competence as a researcher.
<P>
5. Hooker did not attempt to prove that homosexuals were normal
in every way, nor does her study support the idea that homosexuals
as a group are just as stable as heterosexuals.
<P>
6. Hooker was relatively inexperienced in administering the Rorschach
test, and this inexperience may have led to mistakes in the administration
and evaluation of the Rorschach.
<P>
7. On the Thematic Apperception Test and the Make-A-Picture-Story
test -- which require subjects to make up fictional narratives
about depicted scenes -- the homosexuals could not refrain from
including homosexual fantasies in their imaginary accounts.  For
that reason, Hooker altered the nature of the study by no longer
asking the judges to use the TAT and MAPS in an attempt to determine
the sexual orientation of each of the 60 subjects, since the differences
were apparent from the narratives.
<P>
In order to understand fully the nature of the controversy over
Hooker's study, it is helpful to review its history.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE HISTORY OF THE HOOKER STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Evelyn Hooker did not begin her research on homosexuals as a logical
development in her career as a psychologist or even out of a dispassionate
scientific curiosity. From all indications, she undertook the
study to prove that homosexuals could function as normal human
beings.  As she herself said, &quot;How could my hypothesis have
been anything else?  I'd seen these men and saw nothing psychopathological
in their behavior.&quot;[1]
<P>
&quot;These men&quot; were the many friends she'd made in the
Los Angeles homosexual community -- one of whom, Sam From, persuaded
her to undertake the investigation.  &quot;Now we have let you
see us as we are,&quot; he said to the UCLA professor.  &quot;It
is your scientific duty to do a study of people like us.&quot;[2]
 Despite the fact that she was a &quot;rat runner&quot; -- with
no clinical experience in the area of human behavior, she undertook
her study, which would become, along with the Kinsey report, a
prime weapon in the hands of the gay rights movement.
<P>
It is important to examine carefully the manner in which Hooker
planned and executed her research, which was funded by the federal
government's National Institute of Mental Health.  A number of
commentators have failed to read Hooker's own report carefully
or else have deliberately distorted her methods and findings for
their own purposes.  Here is just how she proceeded and what she
found.         
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SELECTION OF SUBJECTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
First, to find her homosexual subjects, she enlisted the early
gay rights group Mattachine Society, which, as she put it in her
published report, &quot;has as its stated purpose the development
of a homosexual ethic....&quot;[3] Members of the Mattachine Society
volunteered for the study and also recruited their friends.  Hooker,
herself, created a &quot;control group&quot; of heterosexuals
for the experiment, despite the fact that on the standardized
tests she intended to use, norms had already been established.
<P>
In her 1957 report, Hooker offers this somewhat cryptic explanation
of heterosexual recruitment:
<P>
Because the heterosexuals were, for the most part, obtained from
community organizations which must remain anonymous, I cannot
describe further the way in which they were obtained.[4]
<P>
Years later, a <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reporter elicited from
Hooker a somewhat different explanation, one that is fairly explicit
in detail:
<P>
She canvassed the education secretaries of labor unions, thinking
that they would have liberal attitudes.  &quot;I was wrong,&quot;
she says; as soon as she explained the nature of the study, no
one wanted to participate...So Hooker took to collaring candidates
wherever she could find them, including a fireman who showed up
to inspect her home.  &quot;No man is safe on Saltair Street,&quot;
joked her husband.[5] 
<P>
She did not insist on a random sampling.  In fact, she deliberately
sought out only those subjects who seemed stable and &quot;normal&quot;
-- at least in their ability to adjust to their social environment.
 She defined the criteria for membership in the groups as follows:
<P>
In both groups subjects were eliminated who were in therapy at
the time.  If, in the preliminary screening, evidence of considerable
disturbance appeared, the individual was eliminated (5 heterosexuals;
5 homosexuals).[6]
<P>
As for the sexual proclivities of the participants, Hooker says
the following in her report:
<P>
I attempted to secure homosexuals who would be pure for homosexuality;
that is, without heterosexual experience.  With three exceptions
this is so.  These three subjects had not had more than three
heterosexual experiences, and they identified themselves as homosexual
in their patterns of desire and behavior.  The heterosexual group
is exclusively heterosexual beyond the adolescent period, with
three exceptions; these three had had a single homosexual experience
each.[7]
<P>
Originally, she chose 40 homosexual subjects and matched them
as closely as possible by age, IQ, and education with 40 heterosexual
subjects.  At some point, as noted parenthetically above, she
found five from each group too unbalanced to include in her study,
so apparently she dropped these ten and their matches in the opposite
groups -- for a total of 20 eliminated.  This winnowing process
reduced the size of the total pool from 80 to 60.
<P>
It is instructive to read her summary of these matchings and then
compare that summary to the chart containing the same information.
<P>
The homosexuals, and thus the heterosexuals, ranged in age from
25 to 50, with an average age of 34.5 for the homosexual group
and 36.6 for the heterosexual group.  The IQ range, as measured
by the Otis Self-Administering Tests of Mental Ability, was from
90 to 135, with an average for the homosexual group of 115.4 and
for the heterosexual group of 116.2.  In education the range was
from completion of grammar school to the equivalent of a master's
degree, with an average for the homosexual group of 13.9 years
and for the heterosexual group of 14.3.[8]
<P>
Turning to the table upon which she lists the age, IQ scores,
and education of all 60 subjects, a careful reader finds that
the figures neatly arranged in columns <I>contradict her summary</I>.
 While she says the age range for all subjects is 25-50, the chart
indicates that the youngest subject is 26 and the oldest 57. 
The figures on the table indicate an average age of 35 for the
homosexuals and 37 for the heterosexuals -- different averages
than the ones Hooker gives.
<P>
In her summary, she says the range of IQ scores is 90-135, but
the lowest IQ score on her chart is 91.  Despite this error, however,
her averages for both homosexuals and heterosexuals are consistent
with the chart.
<P>
On average years of education, she gives as a range the completion
of grammar school to the equivalent of a masters degree.  Here
her summary is at best imprecise, since the least amount of education
is 9 years -- past the junior high level and three years beyond
elementary school.  The highest educational level indicated on
the chart is 18 years, which is a year beyond the course requirement
for most master's programs.  Also, her average education for homosexuals,
based on the chart, should be 14.0 rather than 13.9.
<P>
These mathematical discrepancies are minor but disturbing.  If
all the averages had been incorrect, a generous reader might have
concluded that somehow she had printed the wrong chart -- a single
careless error.  But given the accuracy of <I>some</I> of her
calculations, it seems more likely she made several careless errors.
 A footnote on the first page of the Hooker report suggests that
the materials were rushed into print -- that, though she hesitated
to publish her paper, &quot;[i]n view of the importance of her
findings it seemed desirable to the editors that they be made
public....&quot;[9]  (In other words, she was saying something that
well-placed members of the profession wanted to hear.)      
<P>
To be sure, these figures are largely irrelevant to the final
conclusions of her study.  The averages of ages, IQ scores, and
amount of education lend only marginal credibility to the selection
process.  Yet the inaccuracies tell us something important about
Hooker's reliability as a researcher, the degree to which we can
trust her methodology.  As noted below, Hooker scored the Rorschach
test herself, despite the fact that she had had little previous
experience in this area.  Add to this inexperience a lack of mathematical
precision, and the study begins to pose genuine problems. 
<P>
At this point, two observations are in order concerning Hooker's
overall method of selecting her subjects.  First, in choosing
a small sample that is anything but random, Hooker has declined
to test the proposition that homosexuals and heterosexuals in
society are equally likely to be normal, well-adjusted human beings.
 As she, herself, says in the report, she is only interested in
&quot;whether homosexuality is <I>necessarily</I> [emphasis added]
a symptom of pathology.&quot;  To answer that question, she maintains,
&quot;All we need is a single case in which the answer is negative.&quot;[10]
 In other words, in this study she is concerned with finding at
least one homosexual who, after testing, doesn't fall into the
category of &quot;pathological.&quot;  This is why she has focused
on the healthiest possible cohort.    
<P>
But the limited scope of her study cuts two ways.  Knowing the
nature of the sample, no one could reasonably conclude from her
findings that homosexuals as a group are no more likely to be
mentally disturbed than heterosexuals.  Yet this is precisely
what many have concluded.  If one accepts the study as valid and
definitive, one can only conclude that some homosexuals are not
pathological <I>in their dealings with the world at large.</I>
  As Hooker herself observes, there is no evidence to conclude
that homosexuals are not pathological in their sexual activities.
<P>
A second point to note about Hooker's selection process is her
ease in recruiting homosexual subjects and her difficulty in recruiting
heterosexual subjects.  Indeed, her account in the study report
is evasive; and her later recollections suggest that she may have
shaded the truth initially in order to cover up problems she encountered
in recruiting the control group.         
<P>
This question becomes more pressing when one reads that in her
group of 30 heterosexual men, she still must include three who
have had homosexual experiences <I>in their adult lives</I> --
by no means a &quot;pure&quot; sample -- and we don't know how
many more had had homosexual experiences in adolescence.  No one
-- not even Kinsey -- would call this an unambiguously heterosexual
group.
<P>
From Hooker's own report -- and from a follow-up interview in
later years -- we see that homosexuals were not only eager to
participate, but indeed were the instigators of the study.  They
hoped that it would prove they were &quot;normal&quot; human beings;
so they scoured their own community to find just the right volunteers
to prove her limited hypothesis.  When analyzing the results of
the Hooker study, it's very important to remember who instigated
the project and the fact that the subjects were well aware of
its ultimate goal.  (In light of this fact, the performance of
homosexuals on two of the three tests, as discussed below, may
well indicate that homosexuality generates social behavior that
is obsessive, indeed all but uncontrollable -- certainly one indication
of pathology.) 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE TESTING OF THE SUBJECTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
To prove her thesis, Hooker administered three standardized tests
to her 60 subjects -- the Rorschach Test, the Thematic Apperception
Test (TAT), and the Make-A-Picture-Story test (MAPS).  The Rorschach
test, as most people know, consists of a series of ink blots that
subjects are asked to interpret.  The Thematic Apperception Test
requires subjects to describe and make up stories about pictures
of people in various settings.  The MAPS test requires subjects
to arrange cut-out pictures and then make up a story about their
arrangement.   
<P>
Despite her lack of clinical experience in what is called &quot;projective
techniques,&quot; according to Hooker, she administered and scored
the Rorschach test herself.  After scoring the test and constructing
profiles, she placed the results in random order and passed them
along to two experts in Rorschach analysis.  Thus we have Hooker's
scored results analyzed by Drs. Klopfer and Meyer, with two tasks
in mind: first, to rate the subjects on &quot;overall adjustment&quot;
and second, to see if they could determine which were the homosexuals
and which were the heterosexuals.
<P>
On the task of determining overall adjustment (i.e., social stability),
the judges differed sharply in some respects but agreed in others.
 For example, Judge &quot;A&quot; rated 15 of the 60 as &quot;top&quot;
in stability, while Judge &quot;B&quot; rated only 4 as &quot;top.&quot;
 The other ratings revealed greater agreement. However, more homosexuals
than heterosexuals ranked in the two &quot;top&quot; groupings
and more heterosexuals than homosexuals ranked in the two &quot;bottom&quot;
groupings.
<P>
When assigned the task of choosing between the homosexual and
heterosexual subjects, Judge &quot;A&quot; correctly identified
17 of the 30 pairs and Judge &quot;B&quot; 18 of the 30.  An ideal
random selection would have identified 15 out of 30, though Hooker
is technically correct in saying that, in such a small sample,
the results indicate that &quot;neither judge was able to do better
than chance.&quot;[11]
<P>
Critics of Hooker's Rorschach results make at least two points.
 First, they question her ability to administer and score the
test.  As an animal researcher until the time she undertook this
project, she obviously had logged comparatively little experience
in administering Rorschachs, a delicate and highly complicated
task in which the clinician gently and obliquely elicits spontaneous
responses.  Some authorities in the field maintain that, under
ideal circumstances, a more qualified expert would have explored
many avenues Hooker failed to note and would have found out many
things Hooker missed -- including indications of the pathology
of the homosexuals.
<P>
A second criticism of her methodology is the lack of &quot;blindness&quot;
in the administration of the Rorschach.  Ideally, given the nature
of the results sought, the test should have been administered
under circumstances in which both interviewer and subject were
unaware of the purpose of the test.  In the case of the Hooker
study, both she and her subjects knew what she was striving to
prove -- and both she and the homosexuals had a vested interest
in proving the hypothesis that homosexuals were not necessarily
pathological.
<P>
Can Rorschach subjects tailor their answers to desired ends? 
Absolutely, say some Rorschach experts.  One example of such a
phenomenon in &quot;projective techniques&quot; is called the
&quot;Rosenthal Effect,&quot; in which a subject generates the
results he or she believes the researcher wants.  In this particular
case, both the researcher (Hooker) and her homosexual subjects
had a compelling reason to produce these results.
<P>
Perhaps the most significant implications of Hooker's study came
from the MAPS and TAT results, which were analyzed by a single
judge.  Here is Hooker's own account:
<P>
The problem of identifying the homosexual protocol from this
material was essentially a much easier one than that encountered
with the Rorschach, since few homosexuals failed to give open
[sic] homosexual stories on at least one picture.  The second
task given the Rorschach judges, of distinguishing the homosexual
from the heterosexual records when they were presented in matched
pairs, was therefore omitted.[12]
<P>
Note that the identity of the homosexuals was so obvious in these
tests that Hooker did not even ask the judge to distinguish between
homosexual and heterosexual.  Simply put, the homosexuals gave
themselves away on tests less dependent than the Rorschach on
the training and experience of the examiner.  Despite the fact
that they knew the purpose of this test was to prove their own
stability, normalcy, and lack of differentiation from heterosexuals,
they still did not refrain from indulging themselves in homosexual
fantasies, thereby exposing their sexual appetites.  It is difficult
not to conclude that in verbalizing such fantasies, they were
exhibiting the obsessive nature of homosexuality, the difficulty
of homosexuals to control their desire, even when their reputation
in the psychiatric community was at stake.
<P>
As one research analyst puts it:
<P>
So Hooker's study suggests that sexual fantasies among homosexuals
are irrepressible, so much so that such people cannot always see
ordinary situations and relations as devoid of sexual content,
but must, on occasion, interject sexual significance where it
does not exist or, at the very least, need not exist.  Following
the logical conclusions of this experiment, we are compelled to
conclude that there is something substantively different about
the way homosexuals and heterosexuals look at the world.[13]
<P>
In evaluating the MAPS and TAT results for stability, the single
judge assigned &quot;top&quot; scores to no one; 9 homosexuals
and 7 heterosexuals were rated &quot;next to top&quot;; 15 homosexuals
and 19 heterosexuals were ranked &quot;average&quot;; 6 homosexuals
and 3 heterosexuals were rated &quot;next to bottom&quot;; and
no homosexuals and 1 heterosexual were ranked at the &quot;bottom.&quot;
 (Again, critics say that the absence of &quot;blindness&quot;
raises the possibility that the Rosenthal Effect was again operative
in the evaluation process, since the judge knew what Hooker was
seeking.)
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SUMMARY OF RESULTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The remainder of her study is a highly selective summary of comments
by judges, all of which support her thesis that the two groups
are, in effect, indistinguishable in terms of &quot;overall adjustment.&quot;
 In her own evaluation of the results, Hooker -- aware of the
degree to which she is challenging leading authorities in the
field -- offers a set of &quot;admissions&quot; about the limitations
of her study.  In this section she concedes the possibility that
homosexuals are indeed pathological, a point overlooked by most
of her admirers.
<P><UL>
<LI>She speculates that the psychological defect of homosexuals
may lie &quot;in a weakness of ego-function and control and that
this cannot be adequately diagnosed from projective test protocols.
 As one psychiatrist puts it, the material produced in the Rorschach
is like that produced on the analytic couch.  Two men may produce
very similar material on the couch, but the difference between
them is that one -- the normal -- gets up at the end of the hour
and resumes his normal functioning, while the other does not.&quot;[14]
<P>
<LI>She also admits that the pathology of homosexuality may only
occur &quot;in an erotic situation and that the homosexual can
function well in non-erotic situations such as the Rorschach,
TAT, and MAPS.  Thus, one could defend the hypothesis that homosexuality
is symptomatic of pathology, but that the pathology is confined
to one sector of behavior, namely, the sexual.&quot;[15] (She seems
to have disproved this proposition by her own study, since the
homosexuals were unable to control their sexual fantasies, even
in a &quot;non-erotic situation&quot; such as taking the MAPS
and TAT.)
<P>
<LI>During Hooker's research, she took the life histories of her
subjects; and though she didn't include an analysis of these materials
in her study, she did indicate that when she eventually published
her results, &quot;the life history data from the two groups will
differ:  namely, in the love relationships.  Comparisons between
the number and duration of love relationships, cruising patterns,
and degree of satisfaction with sexual pattern and the love partner
will certainly show clear-cut differences.&quot;[16]
</UL>
Hooker never published the summary of these histories, though
in a fairly recent interview with writer-researcher Edward Eichel,
she said she still hoped to do so after 35 years.  However, she
undoubtedly found in these personal histories what most other
researchers have found:  a substantially greater number of sexual
partners among homosexuals than heterosexuals and a significantly
shorter duration in relationships.  These findings, if published,
could well have cast further doubts on the stability and normalcy
of homosexuals.
<P>
It is significant to note that Hooker's stated reservations seldom,
if ever, find their way into the summaries of her work -- summaries
that are now <I>de rigeur</I> in legal and scholarly discussions
of homosexuality.  Her 1957 report has, like a folk tale, become
simpler and purer in the constant retelling.  Instead of a complicated
account filled with the predictable complexity of life, we now
have only Beauty and the Beast.     
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CITATIONS AND  USES OF THE HOOKER STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Perhaps as important as the Hooker 1957 research itself is the
use that others have made of her findings.  Not only has this
single study with only 60 subjects been cited repeatedly by prominent
psychiatrists, social critics, and gay activists; but such summaries
have also been accepted as part of the expert testimony in high-profile
court cases nationwide.
<P>
Curiously, many of those who cite the study not only incorrectly
summarize its content but do so in remarkably similar fashion.
 It's as if one commentator misread Hooker and all the rest derived
their knowledge from that single erroneous commentary.  Here are
several examples:     
<P><UL>
<LI>In the <I>Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry</I>, Dr. Judd
Marmor, a driving force in the American Psychiatric Association's
decision to drop homosexuality from its manual of disorders, has
written this summary of Hooker's research: &quot;Hooker (1957)
conducted a cooperative study of 30 male homosexuals and 30 male
heterosexuals who were matched for age, I.Q., and education. 
The homosexuals were all rated 6 and the heterosexuals 0 on the
Kinsey scale.  None of the subjects was in therapy.  Two judges
independently, without prior knowledge of which subjects were
which, reviewed the Rorschach protocols, Thematic Apperception
Tests, and Make-a-Picture-Story responses, and tried to distinguish
the homosexuals from the heterosexuals, but they were unable to
do so.&quot;[17]
<P><UL>
<LI>Marmor repeated this very passage when he submitted an affidavit
in <I>Morales v. Texas</I>, a case heard before a state court
in Texas.
<P>
<LI>Dr. Gregory Herek supported Marmor's testimony in <I>Morales
v. Texas</I>, saying under oath: &quot;The classic study in this
case was conducted by Hooker (1957).  She administered the Rorschach,
Thematic Apperception Test, and Make-A-Picture-Story Test...When
asked to assess which protocols were obtained from homosexuals,
the experts were unable to distinguish respondents' sexual orientation
at a level better than chance.&quot;[18]
<P>
<LI>In a 1990 article on Hooker, <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reporter
Bruce Shenitz described the experiment in precisely the same way:
 &quot;On all three tests, two-thirds of the heterosexuals and
homosexuals were assigned a rating of 3 (average) or better. 
Next, the judges were presented with pairs of tests and asked
to distinguish between heterosexuals and homosexual.  They were
able to do so no more accurately than if they were flipping a
coin.&quot;[19]
</UL></UL>
This striking agreement among scientific experts and the working
press is remarkable, especially when one realizes that all of
these accounts <I>are untrue</I>.  Marmor's version is particularly
faulty.  Indeed, the brief passage quoted above contains five
demonstrable errors of fact.
<P>
1.  &quot;The homosexuals were all rated 6 and the heterosexuals
0 on the Kinsey scale.&quot;  In the first place, in her report
Hooker makes no reference whatsoever to the Kinsey scale.  In
the second place, she gives evidence in her narrative to contradict
Marmor's generalization.  Three heterosexuals reported homosexual
contact after adolescence and three homosexuals reported heterosexual
behavior.  Kinsey described his &quot;0&quot; rating as &quot;[e]xclusively
heterosexual with no homosexual&quot; and his &quot;6&quot; rating
as &quot;[e]xclusively homosexual.&quot;
<P>
2. There were three judges involved rather than two, as Marmor
reports.
<P>
3. Dr. Marmor reports that the judges reviewed all three tests
when, in fact, two judges reviewed the Rorschach and one judge
reviewed the MAPS and TAT.
<P>
4. Dr. Marmor states that the judges reviewed the MAPS and the
TAT, as well as the Rorschach, in an attempt to distinguish between
heterosexual and homosexual subjects when, in fact, no judge was
asked to make this distinction for the MAPS and TAT because Hooker
knew the homosexuals had &quot;outed&quot; themselves.  
<P>
5. Contrary to what Marmor states, the MAPS and TAT did indeed
reveal the sexual orientation of the homosexuals.  
<P>
Both Herek and Shenitz make some of the same errors Marmor makes.
<P>
1. They suggest that more than one judge reviewed all test results.
<P>
2. They also state that after looking at the results of all three
tests, the &quot;experts&quot; or &quot;judges&quot; were unable
to distinguish between homosexual and heterosexual subjects.
<P>
Shenitz is no more than a newspaper reporter, but in <I>Morales
v. Texas</I>, Marmor and Herek were testifying as expert scientific
witnesses before a judge -- Marmor as former president of the
American Psychiatric Association.  It is ironic that while the
Morales judge accepted the testimony of Marmor and Herek without
question, he ignored the research of Paul Cameron, who gives a
careful and precise summary of the Hooker study in his volume
<I>The Gay Nineties: What the Empirical Evidence Reveals About
Homosexuality</I>.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
This unquestioning acceptance of &quot;authorities&quot; on the
basis of professional reputation or political correctness threatens
the integrity of our legal system.  Judges must take greater responsibility
for assessing the soundness and accuracy of testimony by so-called
experts; yet, paradoxically, such a task is manifestly beyond
the competence of the court.  This dilemma is the consequence
of the politicizing of the scientific community over the past
several decades, particularly in questions of sexuality.  The
recent exposure of Kinsey's errors indicates just how long researchers
have been careless or deliberately misleading in approaching sexual
questions.  And the widespread acclamation of recent, flawed studies
&quot;proving&quot; that homosexuality is inherited genetically
is evidence that the problem has only worsened over the years.

<P>
The 1995 federal appropriation bills which were approved by the
last Congress are filled with duplication, political favoritism,
social agendas, and questionable grants.  The alarming misuse
of taxpayer money should encourage citizens to demand more accountability.
<P>
Consider some government spending already approved for 1995:
<P>
<UL><LI> The Corporation for Public Broadcasting may pay a single individual
$438,000 for a once-a-week, 30-minute TV appearance.[1]
<P>
<LI>Federally financed Howard University gets $5.5 million to prepare
practicing attorneys to do pro bono work in Washington, DC.
<P>
<LI>NIH will spend $2.5 million to build playgrounds for monkeys.
<P>
<LI>DOT will spend $400,000 to help Russians build roads.
<P>
<LI>The Pentagon will spend $18 million for new homes at an Army
base that is losing one third of its existing personnel.
<P>
<LI>The State Department will give Russians $15 million for &quot;family
planning.&quot;
<P>
<LI>The State Department will spend $750,000 to study tropical bird
migration.
<P>
<LI>The EPA will spend $250,000 to control zebra mussels in the
City of Chicago.
<P>
<LI>The EPA will spend $70,000 to study a European fish in Lake
Superior.
<P>
<LI>HUD will spend $53 million for a sewage plant in Mexico.
<P>
<LI>The Forest Service will spend $635,000 to build a visitor center
on a remote and inaccessible by road peninsula on Alaska's panhandle.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>DETAILS FROM 13 APPROPRIATION BILLS</h3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>1. Foreign aid in non-foreign bills</B>:  The appropriations
bill for &quot;The ForeignOperations, Export Financing, and Related Programs for the Fiscal
Year Ending September 30, 1995&quot; includes funding for most
foreign aid programs.  Foreign aid, however, can be found in other
bills.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Federal Highway Administration was given $400,000 to provide
technical assistance to Russia.[2] 
<P>
<LI>The Department for Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was given
$52.5 million to finance the construction of a waste treatment
plant in Tijuana, Mexico.[3]  HUD is funding a second wastewater
facility near Micicali, Mexico for $47.5 million.[4] (Congress also
appropriated $1 million through the International Boundary and
Water Commission to reimburse the City of San Diego for treatment
of Tijuana sewage.[5]) 
<P>
<LI>Funding for the Smithsonian Institution includes a $50,000 grant
to the Mpala Center, Kenya for facility and equipment purchases.[6]
</UL>
<B>2. Suspect foreign aid</B>.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The State Department will provide $15 million for &quot;family
planning&quot; to Russia in 1995.[7]
<P>
<LI>It will give $50 million to the United Nation Population Fund
(UNPF) with the intention that none of this money will be used
to fund abortions in China.[8] The UNPF is expected to give $7 million
for &quot;voluntary family planning programs&quot; in China.[9]
<P>
<LI>The State Department will grant $750,000 to the Fish and Wildlife
Foundation to study neotropical migratory bird conservation.[10]
</UL>
<B>3. Duplication of programs</B>.  Our government should
look to eliminate redundancy.  Consider:
<P><UL>
<LI>The Treasury Department's plan to build a training facility
near Tuscon, Arizona.  There will be a dormitory, a dining facility
and $2.9 million in firearm ranges.[11] Just outside of Tuscon is
the Army's Fort Huachuca, which has many modern firearm ranges.
 Treasury should arrange with the Army to use existing ranges
rather than building duplicate firing facilities.  After all,
the FBI Academy's entire campus is located on Quantico Marine
Base in Virginia where it has joint use of all ranges.
<P>
<LI>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was appropriated
$175,000 for a special purpose grant to be given to Domestic Violence
Prevention, Inc. in Bowie County, Texas.[12] Why is housing money
used for this project when the 1994 crime bill authorizes $324
million for the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act?[13]
The crime bill also has $10 million for nonprofit organizations
to establish projects that coordinate intervention and prevention
of domestic violence, and authorizes $30 million for rural domestic
violence and child abuse enforcement.
<P>
<LI>The Department of Interior received $800,000 to monitor salmon
on Alaska's Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers.[14] The National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will spend another $700,000
to collect information on salmon in the Yukon River as well.[15]
NOAA collects information on salmon at other locations as well.
<P>
<LI>The Small Business Administration is directed to grant $3.25
million for three incubator facilities.[16]
<P>
<LI>The Justice Department is appropriated $29 million for &quot;Drug
Courts&quot; which is a program that provides drug treatment during
and after incarceration for non-violent offenders.[17] This replicates
ongoing programs both inside prisons and in many communities.
<P>
<LI>The National Science Foundation was appropriated $2 million
to establish in 1995 an interdisciplinary center to support research
on violence.[18] The 1994 crime bill authorizes many programs to
research violence:[19]
<P><UL>
<LI>Title IV-Violence Against Women Act of 1994 requires the Attorney
General to study campus sexual assaults, the &quot;battered women's
syndrome,&quot; the abusive spouse, and domestic violence.[20]
<P>
<LI>Title III-Crime Prevention includes research grants to investigate
juvenile violence, drug use, and gang violence.[21]
<P>
<LI>Virtually every section of the crime bill requires at least
one federal agency to either study or research special aspects
of violence.[22]
</UL><P>
<LI>HUD will award housing money for six substance abuse programs
and eight crime prevention programs.[23] The 1994 crime bill includes
duplicate grant programs.
<P>
<LI>Congress has already appropriated $20.4 million for federal
support of the 1995 Special Olympics in New Haven, Connecticut
and both the XXVI Olympiad and the X Paralympiad in Atlanta in
1996.[24] The GSA and HUD will contribute $3 million to the X Paralympiad.
 (The Paralympiad was established in 1960 to create awareness
of athletes with physical disabilities.)  The X Paralympiad will
take place in Atlanta August 16-17, just after the Olympic Games.
 Some 4,000 athletes representing 110 countries are expected to
participate.  HUD's contribution goes to assist disabled veterans
to participate.
<P>
<LI>Congress appropriated $5.6 million for the taxpayer funded District
of Columbia School of Law ignoring Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly's
recommendation to close the school.  Two of the best law schools
in the nation are in Washington, D.C. - Georgetown University
and American University and another is in nearby Baltimore.  Additionally,
the appropriation bill lists the other reasons to close the school:
it must dramatically expand its library before it can earn full
accreditation; it must increase faculty salaries and other staff
and student services; and the school needs a permanent facility
of at least 125,000 square feet.[25]
</UL>
<B>4. Spending to remember former Congressional Leaders.</B>
<P><UL>
<LI>The National Historical Publications and Records Commission
is giving $2 million to the Thomas P. &quot;Tip&quot; O'Neill,
Jr. Library at Boston College.[26] The money will be used to organize
Mr. O'Neill's personal papers.  
<P>
<LI>Two million dollars was also granted to the Robert H. and Corinne
W. Michel Congressional Education Fund.[27]  Michel was for many years
the House minority leader.  
<P>
<LI>The Merit Systems Protection Board granted $10 million to the
Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental
Policy Foundation.[28] Udall was a liberal congressman and environmentalist
from Arizona.
</UL>
<B>5. Other questionable expenditures.</B>  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Army recently announced that the 1st Infantry Division headquartered
at Fort Riley, Kansas will be removed from the force.  This means
approximately 5,600 soldiers or a third of the post's population
will leave.  Meanwhile, Congress has appropriated $12.6 million
to build 126 new homes at Fort Riley.[29]
<P>
<LI>The 6th Infantry Division headquartered at Fort Wainwright,
Alaska was deactivated in July, 1994.  Cuts in the Army's presence
in Alaska will be felt at both Fort Wainwright and Fort Richardson
which is near Anchorage.  Yet, Congress appropriated $5 million
to build 72 new homes at Fort Richardson and $66 million to replace
the nearby and jointly used Elmendorf Air Force Base hospital.[30]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Agriculture's Forest Service will spend $635,000
to build a visitor center at Ketchikan, Alaska.  Ketchikan is
located on a remote peninsula reachable only by boat and small
plane.  Ketchikan county has a population of 14,000 inhabitants
scattered among numerous small villages.  The Department also
gave $500,000 to Alaska because &quot;many timber mills have closed.&quot;[31]
<P>
<LI>The National Institutes of Health, National Center for Research
Resources, was directed by the conference committee to reserve
$2.5 million for playgrounds for monkeys used in research.[32]
<P>
<LI>The federal government helps to fund Washington, D.C.'s Howard
University.  Part of the University's 1995 appropriations ($5.5
million) are for the creation of a Law School Clinical Center
to provide legal assistance to supplement the Legal Services Corporation
and to conduct training for practicing attorneys to perform pro
bono (free) services.[33]
</UL>
<B>6. Did you know?</B>  Here are some of the various
and sundry federal spending programs.
<P><UL>
<LI>$46 million to build and operate military child development
centers, including one in Germany and one in Great Britain.[34] These
federally subsidized centers are part of a growing network of
child care facilities that include every military activity worldwide.
<P>
<LI>$45 million will be spent by the Library of Congress for books
for blind and physically handicapped people.[35]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Transportation will give $26 million for employee
bonuses and cash awards.[36]
<P>
<LI>$2.7 million to the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.[37]
 This 34 person organization oversees construction projects along
Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue.
<P>
<LI>$27 million annual operating expenses for the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Council, which is a private organization that oversees
the Holocaust Museum.[38] This relatively small but popular museum
was first opened to the public two years ago.  It was built with
$168 million in private donations raised in just four years.[39]
The Council continues to receive donations from many national
and local organizations.
<P>
<LI>Child Nutrition Programs include $500,000 in state grants for
special dietary needs of children with disabilities.[40]
<P>
<LI>$7 million for the private organization American Printing House
for the Blind.[41]
<P>
<LI>The State Department oversees a $533 million United Nations
peacekeeping appropriation.  This money can be spent with one
stipulation: that American manufacturers and suppliers are given
an &quot;equal&quot; opportunity to provide equipment, services,
and materials to the United Nations peacekeepers.[42] The Senate
amended this appropriation to transfer $350 million to unspecified
&quot;International Organizations&quot; for peacekeeping activities.[43]
<P>
<LI>HUD will grant the City of Chicago $250,000 to control zebra
mussels which originally came from the Black Sea area of Europe.[44]
 The Department of Interior will continue to study zebra mussels
at St. Croix, Virgin Islands.[45] The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration was appropriated $3.7 million to research zebra
mussels.[46] If the zebra mussel is truly endangering our oceans
and lakes, then a more focused effort should be undertaken.
</UL>
<B>7. Legislating inside appropriation bills.</B>  Five
appropriation bills contain social legislation.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Architect of the Capitol is directed to hire a &quot;diverse
labor force.&quot;[47] This means hiring quotas.
<P>
<LI>The National Science Foundation is directed to award at least
20 percent of all grants to small colleges and universities that
consist of &quot;predominantly underrepresented groups&quot; in
science and technology.[48]
<P>
<LI>When hiring investigators the John F. Kennedy Assassination
Records Review Board is directed to give preferential treatment
to former Office of Personnel Management employees.[49]
<P>
<LI>The Office of Personnel Management is encouraged to promote
&quot;diversity.&quot;  OPM's definition of &quot;diversity&quot;
includes people of different sexual orientation.[50]
<P>
<LI>The appropriation bill for the Department of Agriculture deletes
Senate language aimed at ending the use of taxpayer funds to promote
homosexuality.[51]
<P>
<LI>Health and Human Services is directed to increase quotas for
black nurses nationally.[52]
<P>
<LI>The Federal Bureau of Investigation was appropriated funds to
restore special agents &quot;eliminated in prior years associated
with background investigations.&quot;[53] A former marker for elimination
based on a background investigation was identifying the candidate
as a homosexual.  The FBI Academy has started training for homosexuals
previously rejected.
</UL>
<B>8. Please explain these appropriations.</B>  Many programs
are funded without adequate explanation.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Department of Education is awarding $4 million to the Mary
McLeod Bethune Memorial Fine Arts Center on the campus of Bethune
Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida.[54] The facility will
allow students to be trained for the fields of entertainment and
hotel management.[55]
<P>
<LI>The U.S. Institute of Peace gets $11.5 million.[56] The ten year
old institute has received $76 million in federal grants.  In
1991 it shifted from discussing peace to teaching conflict resolution
in America's classrooms.  There are more than 300 violence-prevention
programs and 100 conflict resolution curricula available to America's
28,000 high schools and 78,000 grade schools.[57] The 1994 crime
bill contains many grants for anti-violence programs.  
<P>
<LI>The Bureau of Mines is directed to do &quot;essential Arctic
research&quot; in Anchorage, Alaska.[58]  Anchorage is 400 miles south
of the Arctic Circle and has no arctic characteristics like permafrost.
 Why not conduct the research nearer the Arctic Circle, perhaps
at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks?
<P>
<LI>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration
is appropriated $1.5 million for the Pan-Pacific Educational and
Cultural Experiments by Satellite Program.[59]
<P>
<LI>Washington, D.C. received $720 million from the federal government
for public education.  The appropriation bill states, &quot;the
Board of Education has overspent its appropriation for personal
services by millions of dollars while underspending its appropriation
for other-than-personal-services by an equal amount.  The chronic
recurrence of such an imbalance suggests that the Board of Education
habitually submits budgets to the Congress that the Board knows
to be unrealistic and that the Board intends to disregard.&quot;[60]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Housing and Urban Development will award 261
special purpose grants worth $291 million.[61] These include:
<P><UL>
<LI>$450,000 to construct the Center for Political Participation
at the University of Maryland.[62] The Center &quot;is the first
academically-sanctioned program in the country to support young
leaders seeking elective office.&quot;[63] The advisory board includes
actress Morgan Fairchild, Congressman Steny Hoyer, Congresswoman
Connie Morella, <I>ABC News'</I> Sheila Kast, and the wife of
Maryland governor Parris Glendening.[64]
<P>
<LI>$500,000 to the Maine College of Art for renovations to a Portland
building.[65]
<P>
<LI>$1 million to develop the Center for Pacific Rim Studies in
San Francisco.[66] The Center will do research on competition and
offer training for professionals.  It is focused on trade development,
including foreign language and culture, legal systems, commercial
practices and data links.[67]
<P>
<LI>$6.5 million for the Points of Light Foundation.[68] The <I>Los
Angeles Times</I> found that the Foundation in its first four
years spent $22 million on administrative expenses and $4 million
on grants to service organizations.  Expenses included $1.4 million
for a kickoff celebration and more than $108,000 paid to the Hill
and Knowlton public relations firm to promote the party, as well
as a $160,000 salary for its top executive.  In the first four
years, it received $26 million from the government.[69]
<P>
<LI>$500,000 for the National Invention Resource Center in the
City of Akron, Ohio.[70] The Center is part of the nonprofit Inventure
Place which opens July, 1995.
<P>
<LI>$70,000 to study the European Ruffe in Lake Superior.[71] The
Ruffe was introduced in 1986 to Duluth Harbor which is on Lake
Superior.  The Ruffe now makes up 65 percent of the harbor's fish
population.  Why is federal housing money being used to study
the spread of this fish?  Possibly some of the $450,000 appropriated
for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission could be used to study
the Ruffe.[72]
<P>
<LI>$750,000 for a center to coordinate academic training for physical
therapists at the Veterans' Administration hospitals in Brooklyn,
NY.[73]
<P>
<LI>$2.5 million for Project Social Care MB, Inc. to serve elderly
Holocaust survivors in Brooklyn, NY.[74] There are about 2,000 Holocaust
survivors in the greater New York metro area.  Another organization,
Selfhelp Community Services, has a $51 million annual budget and
has the prime focus on helping survivors.[75]
<P>
<LI>$250,000 for port modernization at Davisville, Rhode Island.[76]
<P>
<LI>$300,000 to expand the science and mathematics complex at the
University of South Carolina.[77]
<P>
<LI>$1.2 million for the Fire Safe Cigarette Act.[78] These funds
go to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the National
Institute of Standards and Technology to measure the cigarette's
ignition propensity.[79]
<P>
<LI>HUD special purpose grants also fund: 5 child care centers,
the restoration of 5 theaters/museums, restoring or building 5
libraries, running a summer camp program, and building a bicentennial
and media activities center for a city.[80]
</UL></UL>
<B>9. AIDS money scattered among bills.</B>  Most AIDS
money is found in the appropriations for HHS, but AIDS money is
in other bills as well.
<P><UL>
<LI>The Department of Agriculture will grant Indiana $250,000 to
study HIV/STD prevention in rural areas.[81]
<P>
<LI>The Pentagon is being given $33 million to study AIDS.[82]
<P>
<LI>HUD is appropriated $186 million for housing people with AIDS.[83]
 HUD also is awarding special purpose grants worth $4.3 million
for other HIV housing facilities.[84]
</UL>
<B>10. Politics and agriculture appropriations.</B>  The
1995 agriculture appropriations appear to be based more on politics
than merit.  The top three states to receive agriculture grants
earmarked by state were Arkansas, Iowa and Mississippi.[85] Arkansas
received $17.7 million, Iowa received $11.9 million, and Mississippi
received $10.45 million.
<P>
Senators from these states were on the conference committee for
appropriations.  Additionally, President Clinton is from Arkansas
and former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Epsy is from Mississippi.
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce reports that the highest net farm
income for 1991 came from California which ranked seventh in discretionary
agriculture grants.  Mississippi ranked 21 in net income and Arkansas
was ninth.[86] But Arkansas received almost 300 percent more discretionary
grant money than California, the highest farm income state.  Arkansas
grants included:
<P><UL>
<LI>$462,000 for a National Center for Agricultural Law Research
and Information at the Leflar School of Law in Fayetteville, Arkansas.[87]
<P>
<LI>$1.2 million for a new agriculture building and $946,000 for
an Alternative Pest Control Center at the University of Arkansas.[88]
<P>
<LI>$4.8 million for the Rice Germplasm Center, Stuttgard, Arkansas.[89]
<P>
<LI>$1.1 million for the Arkansas Children's Hospital.[90]
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Taxpayers should demand that the 104th Congress review and rescind
appropriations that waste money or promote a political agenda.

<P>
Thirty years ago this March, Daniel Patrick Moynihan issued his
famous warning about the breakdown of the black family.  At the
time, liberal intellectuals and civil rights activists excoriated
him for &quot;defending middle-class values.&quot;  &quot;What
may seem to be a disease to the white middle class may be a healthy
adaptation to the Negro lower class,&quot;[1] Bayard Rustin intoned.
<P>
Today, however, overwhelming empirical evidence demonstrates that
there is nothing at all &quot;healthy&quot; about the decay of
families and that not all personal choices are equal in terms
of their impact on children, families, and communities.  The evidence
itself has propelled illegitimacy to the forefront of the current
national debate over welfare reform.
<P>
While a burgeoning white illegitimacy rate has helped strip the
debate of racial overtones, a black Democrat named Wayne Bryant
has pioneered in the state of New Jersey one of the key anti-illegitimacy
provisions recently adopted by the U.S. House.  The so-called
&quot;family cap&quot; would deny benefit increases to mothers
who bear additional illegitimate children while on welfare.
<P>
The essential purpose of the reform, according to Bryant, is to
restore healthy families.  &quot;Until the needs and the problems
of the family are confronted in a comprehensive way, welfare will
continue its course of entrapping one generation after the next
in a modern form of slavery,&quot;[2] he wrote in a paper describing
his proposal.
<P>
By incorporating the family cap, Senator Bryant intended, not
to constrict reproductive choices or to reduce births per se,
but to promote a sense of responsibility by insisting that families
on welfare live by the same values and confront exactly the same
choices as the general population.  He explained the rationale
for the cap in a series of newspaper interviews:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These welfare reform measures are not so much about capping family
size as they are about giving recipients a chance to make choices.
 Under our conventional welfare system, 
welfare mothers are effectively shielded from confronting the
difficult questions that other American parents face when considering
additional children.... I never pretended or intended to have
the law bring about a dramatic increase in births.  It was a responsibility
issue.... Why should people on welfare be guaranteed a 'raise'
when they have additional children?  If a person wants to enlarge
their family while on welfare, they should go to work to support
the additional children like any other working family....No one
is saying welfare mothers can't have families.  We're just saying
the state won't pay for it....If the kids are suffering because
parents are irresponsible in having children they cannot afford,
they'll still suffer if we give them the money because the parents
will still be irresponsible....The battle is dissolving the wall
that separates welfare families from the mainstream population
-- and the cap is an important part of that effort.[3]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Echoing Senator Bryant's most popular argument, California's welfare
commissioner Eloise Anderson is even more blunt: &quot;Working
women do not get automatic raises when they have children.  Why
should our expectations of a woman on AFDC be any different than
any other woman?  Do we think they're stupider or less capable
of being rational?&quot;[4] New Jersey's human services commissioner,
William Waldman, agrees: &quot;A lot of what we do [in the name
of welfare] is very patronizing.&quot;[5]
<P>
Since the family cap took effect in New Jersey in August of 1993,
the birth rate among welfare mothers in the state has dropped
substantially -- powerful proof that women on welfare are indeed
capable of governing their own decisions.  Robert Rector of the
Heritage Foundation estimates a decrease greater than 20 percent;[6]
but like Wayne Bryant, he too emphasizes that even if the birthrate
had not fallen the policy would be justified.  &quot;I support
the family cap simply because it's morally correct,&quot;[7] Rector
says.
<P>
Even the more conservative estimate of the birthrate decrease
reported by the New Jersey Department of Human Services (11.4
percent)[8] vindicates the two fundamental principles underlying
the current national debate: that economic incentives do influence
out-of-wedlock childbearing and that subsidizing irresponsible
sexual behavior has accelerated the moral and cultural decline
beyond what even Moynihan envisioned.
<P>
While Charles Murray notes that much of the force of noneconomic
social stigma was underwritten by economics in the past, he argues
that contemporary &quot;[w]elfare will not be abolished [despite
the potential economic savings to communities] until the moral
sanctions against illegitimacy have also gained great strength.&quot;[9]
 The seeming paradox highlights the difficulty of defining precisely
how government can promote character formation.
<P>
James Q. Wilson answers that &quot;[t]he essential first step
is to acknowledge that at root, in almost every area of important
public concern, we are seeking to induce persons to act virtuously&quot;[10]
-- a statement that has grown less controversial in the 30 years
since the Moynihan Report met with violent protest from moral
relativists who denied the existence of an absolute standard of
virtue.  Today, there is a mounting public consensus that bearing
children out of wedlock is wrong and that the perverse incentives
of the welfare system share much of the blame.
<P>
In a continuation of the same passage, Professor Wilson explains
the moral implications of economic incentives: &quot;Virtue is
not learned by precept...; it is learned by the regular repetition
of right actions.... Seen this way, there is no conflict between
economic thought and moral philosophy: The latter simply supplies
a fuller statement of the uses to which the former can and should
be put.  We...induce habits of right conduct...by arranging the
incentives confronting youngsters in the ordinary aspects of their
daily lives so that right action routinely occurs.&quot;[11]
<P>
Yet, morality is not merely a product of rational choices in response
to economic incentives.  If man is more than a material being,
then it is not unreasonable to expect some individual moral decisions
to override the economic incentives that run against the grain
of virtue.  Nor is it implausible to suggest that, of all the
choices an individual mother must make, the decision to abort
her child -- the most galvanizing moral issue of our day -- is
the one least likely to respond to policy variables.  
<P>
Precisely because human behavior is governed by a unique complex
of moral instinct and rational choice, the elimination of additional
cash benefits in New Jersey has decreased the birthrate without
causing an upsurge in the abortion rate.  While it is far too
premature to draw any decisive conclusions, there is absolutely
no statistical confirmation as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the New Jersey family cap took effect August
1, 1993.In fact, the total number of Medicaid-funded abortions in New Jersey
declined from 13,629 in 1993 to 13,424 in 1994.[12]
<P>
In fact, Anita Leone, executive director of an association that
represents all the publicly-funded abortion clinics in New Jersey,
asserted in a recent interview: &quot;We know that abortions in
New Jersey are currently <I>decreasing</I>.  We just don't know
why.&quot;[13] Because the decline in the birth rate among welfare
mothers in New Jersey has been rather substantial since the implementation
of the family cap, the fact that an increase in abortions is not
evident is particularly significant.
<P>
The anecdotal evidence collected by those who are on the front-lines
of welfare reform in New Jersey confirms the general pattern that
is beginning to emerge from the data.  Richard Traynor of the
Legal Center for Defense of Life in New Jersey and David Sciarra
of New Jersey Legal Services, who together filed a class-action
suit over the New Jersey family cap, both commented in telephone
interviews that the class was certified to include welfare mothers
who had aborted their babies -- but that neither one could locate
a woman who had actually aborted in the wake of the cap.
<P>
Instead, the only plaintiffs who mention abortion in their affidavits
explain that they consciously decided on moral grounds <I>not</I>
to terminate their pregnancies, despite increased economic pressures.
One woman testified that she made an appointment at an abortion
clinic but ultimately &quot;became very upset about having an
abortion and decided that [she] could not go through with it.&quot;
 Another woman who already had two children and was carrying triplets
-- three times the pressure -- never even considered abortion.[14]
<P>
Women interviewed at Chelton Terrace in New Jersey said &quot;they
didn't see the cap forcing women into abortion clinics.  'It's
not going to make them get any more abortions than what they've
been getting,' one woman said.  'If you want to have that baby,
you will.'&quot;[15] Another woman in Camden, New Jersey said that
she knew about the cap but decided to have her baby anyway.  &quot;Abortion
is against my faith,&quot;[16] she explained.
<P>
A church pastor in the same town related a telling story.  A young
welfare mother had come to the church grieving over a miscarriage.
 Another pastor gently reminded her that she really had no way
of providing for a second child and that the state would not increase
her grant.  &quot;But it just didn't make sense to her,&quot;[17]
the pastor concluded, because mothers do not tend to subject their
relationships with their children to a strict cost-benefit analysis.
 Only the most callous of mothers places a price tag on her baby's
head.
<P>
One welfare mother recently quoted in <i>The New York Times</i>
said it perhaps most eloquently: &quot;[My fourth child] wasn't
planned, but I wasn't going to abort her.  Sixty-four dollars
is not going to change my love for my child, and if I would have
aborted her, it wouldn't have comforted my soul.... You just learn
that a pound of ground beef is overrated.&quot;[18]
<P>
Michelle Scholz of the Northwest Pregnancy Center in Washington,
D.C. explains that in her experience a mother decides first whether
or not to keep her baby and, then, how to pay for the child's
care.[19] Sister Connie Driscoll, founder of St. Martin de Porres
House of Hope in Chicago, testifies that over 9,000 destitute
women have passed through her shelter in the last 12 years.  Not
one of those women has opted for an abortion.[20]
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  And welfare mothers are apparently
more inclined to consider &quot;non-rational&quot; factors than
any other population group.  Public opinion data collected by
the Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more
morally repugnant to poor women;[21] and the fact that abortion rates
for teen welfare mothers are <i>lower</i> than national averages
for all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic
factors determine the decision to carry a child to term.[22]
<P>
Many who now argue otherwise are precisely the ones who maintain
that the current benefits level is already far too low to cover
the costs associated with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical
to predict that a cap would have a sufficiently significant impact
on the &quot;affordability&quot; of another child to trigger such
a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
State-by-state data from the 1980s demonstrate that small changes
in welfare payouts do not affect abortion rates in the short term;
and Michael Schwartz of Life Advocacy Alliance has found in analyzing
more recent data that states with the highest average monthly
benefit for a family of three also tend to have the highest ratio
of abortions to live births.[23]
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, the only &quot;evidence&quot; the plaintiffs
could offer in the New Jersey suit was 55 letters from pro-life
activists expressing concern that freezing benefits might increase
abortions.  As of yet, there is nothing more concrete than their
concern itself to corroborate their claims; and pro-lifers who
are unconvinced by the hearsay -- including John Tomicki, past
president of New Jersey Right to Life -- have concluded that welfare
reform itself is a pro-life cause.
<P>
The findings in New Jersey are striking evidence of the latent
moral potential in welfare mothers that is begging to be cultivated,
rather than frustrated by the perpetuation of policies that subsidize
immorality.  Remedial policies should reconcile the current tension
between moral knowledge and the economic incentives of the welfare
system -- before moral knowledge is altogether gone from the inner
city.
<P>
Charles Murray explains that, when illegitimacy reaches a critical
mass, the neighborhood effects create problems that extend far
beyond the recipients of welfare.  Community values and the norms
for male behavior are changed, and with them the behavior of young
men and women who never touch an AFDC check.  Thus, the effect
of those checks springs not only from discrete changes in economic
incentives but from a larger, more pervasive effect on the formation
of character among poor young people.[24]
<P>
Yet, conservatives must acknowledge that government cannot be
an effective moral teacher.  Public policy can undermine, but
never instill, virtue.
<P>
Rather than attempting to devise the perfect bundle of carrots
and sticks, we must eliminate altogether the government subsidies
that skew welfare recipients' decisions by shielding them from
the natural economic consequences.  Michael Tanner of the Cato
Institute writes: &quot;We could reasonably expect that people,
faced with the consequences of their actions, would change their
behavior.  Such an approach would avoid coercion and the conceit
that government knows best.&quot;[25]
<P>
Getting government out of the way, of course, is the theme that
unites social conservatives and economic libertarians.  In <i>The
Road to Serfdom</i>, F. A. Hayek emphasized the symbiotic relationship
between morality and freedom from government intervention:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Freedom to order our own conduct in the sphere where material
circumstances force a choice upon us, and responsibility for the
arrangement of our own life according to our own conscience, is
the air in which alone moral sense grows and in which moral values
are daily re-created in the free decision of the individual.[26]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It is the intrinsic truth of Hayek's observation that motivated
Wayne Bryant to institute the family cap in New Jersey -- a cap
he himself describes as a mechanism to reduce government constriction
of personal choices.[27]
<P>
Government must instead cede ground to the character-forming institutions
that are found in every community -- families, churches, schools,
charities, and other traditional arrangements that have been supplanted
by public authorities.  Rather than merely ending government programs,
conservatives intend to <I>replace</I> government welfare by advancing
proposals like a tax credit for charitable contributions that
will help to strengthen civil institutions.
<P>
Unless those institutions are reinvigorated and social functions
are restored to neighborhoods and communities, the behavioral
problems Daniel Patrick Moynihan described 30 years ago will only
continue to grow more acute, jeopardizing personal freedoms and
ultimately the survival of the republic itself.  If it is true
that moral values do not have concrete meaning in the absence
of freedom, it is also true that the preservation of political
liberty depends upon the cultivation 
of virtue in the people.

<P>
American families must balance expenses with income.  When this
fails, they delay clothing purchases or visits to the dentist.
  Such decisions are difficult,  but the alternative of  mounting
debt is too risky.  These hard-working taxpayers likewise expect
the federal government to keep its fiscal house in order by balancing
expenses with income.
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee is beginning
the process of balancing  the national budget.  The Committee
proposes a balanced budget by the year 2002, but to get there
will require a lot of  belt tightening.   
<P>
Their proposed budget includes many needed cuts.  They propose
to terminate, privatize, or convert to block grants three Cabinet
departments, 284 programs, 69 commissions, 13 agencies, and three
commercial activities.[1]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DEPARTMENTS TO BE ELIMINATED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
The Department of Energy was created in 1977 by President Jimmy
Carter in response to the energy crisis of the early 1970s.  
The 20,213-employee agency promotes energy conservation, controls
federal supplies of power, and develops alternative sources of
energy.   However, 85 percent of DoE's budget is spent on activities
that are not energy related.[2]
<P>
The Department of Education was established in 1979 by President
Carter to expand the federal role in education.  The Department's
budget has doubled while student performance has declined.   According
to former Secretary of Education William Bennett, more than 90
percent of the students entering U.S. colleges today would not
be admitted to post-secondary education anywhere else in the world.[3]
 In fact, only a small part of federal education spending reaches
American classrooms.  Most of the Department's current functions
of technical assistance and information can be transferred to
the states or other federal agencies.
<P>
The Department of Commerce was created in 1903 and spends $3.6
billion per year on more than 100 programs of which three-fourths
are duplicated by other federal agencies.  More than half of the
Department's budget and a third of its employees staff the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.[4] This organization would
become an independent agency.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>AGENCIES TO BE ELIMINATED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Just as America's taxpayers can do without the three cabinet-level
departments targeted for elimination in the House GOP Budget,
they can surely get along without the 13 agencies the House GOP
Budget would eliminate.  For example:
<UL>
<LI>The U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration was created in
1981 and spends $17 million per year promoting tourism and recreation
activities by conducting surveys, distributing promotional material,
and running regional marketing shows.  There is no reason for
the federal government to be involved in an activity that is already
handled by a prosperous private industry.[5]
<P>
<LI>The Minority Business Development Agency was created in 1971
to promote the development of minority-owned businesses and to
steer these businesses toward government contracts.  It was appropriated
$44 million in fiscal 1996 even though it duplicates a  loan program
run by the Small Business Administration.[6] 
<P>
<LI>The Maritime Administration was created in 1950 to tap the
domestic maritime fleet in case of national emergency.  Unfortunately,
the government-owned &quot;Ready Reserve Force&quot; was not seaworthy
during the Persian Gulf call-up.   The Maritime Administration
is part of the Department of Transportation and primarily acts
as a custodian of federal subsidies used to shield U.S. vessels
from foreign competition.[7]  But most (96 percent) of all waterborne
cargo entering or leaving the U.S. is on American vessels.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>PROGRAMS ELIMINATED (284)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Likewise, most taxpayers aren't likely to miss the 284 programs
eliminated by the House GOP Budget.  These programs include:
<UL>
<LI>The Federal Helium Reserve and Processing Facility will cost
$26 million over the next five years.  It was established in 1925
to insure a constant supply of helium for military blimps and
observation balloons which are no longer used.  The United States
produces most of the world's helium, exporting 5.5 times as much
helium as is produced worldwide.  But the government stays in
the helium business because of a federal ban prohibiting NASA
and the Pentagon from purchasing privately produced helium.[8]
<P>
<LI>The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, which will
spend $2.7 million in 1995, was established in 1972 to oversee
the &quot;Avenue's revitalization.&quot;  The corporation is governed
by a 23-member board which oversees joint ventures with the private
sector, sponsors festivals, cultural performances, and athletic
events on Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue.[9]
<P>
<LI>The Points of Light Foundation in its first four years spent
$22 million on administrative expenses and $4 million on grants
to service organizations.  Expenses included $1.4 million for
a kickoff celebration and more than $108,000 paid to a public
relations firm to promote the party, as well as a $160,000 salary
for its top executive.[10]
<P>
<LI>The National Rail Passenger Corporation (AMTRAK) was created
in 1970 to take over the nation's ailing private passenger rail
service.  It has cost the taxpayer $17 billion but carries less
than one-half of one percent of America's inter-city passengers
or about 22 million passengers a year, a quarter of the entire
rail passenger service.[11]
<P>
<LI>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was established
in 1968 and now sponsors more than 600 National Public Radio (NPR)
stations and 340 Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television
stations.  PBS and NPR are primarily (80 percent) funded through
private and non-federal public donations, but the federal share
provided by CPB for fiscal year 1996  is $286 million.[12]
<P>
<LI>The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was created in 1974 to
provide low-income individuals with legal representation. LSC
will spend part of this year's $415 million budget to fund lobbying
or campaigning for local political initiatives.  The agency, a
piggybank for left-wing causes, has fought reforms designed to
reduce out-of-wedlock births; filed suit against a nonprofit homeless
shelter; and tried to create a &quot;constitutional right&quot;
to federal welfare.[13]
<P>
<LI>The AmeriCorps program, created by President Clinton, funds
community-based organizations &quot;to address problems they identify
by using the skills of individuals serving in National Service
positions.&quot;  Participants are given a stipend, an educational
award or credit toward student loan repayment, medical benefits,
and free child care for volunteer work.  The taxpayer cost for
each &quot;volunteer&quot; exceeds $30,000 or more than $3 billion
over the next five years.[14]
<P>
<LI>The National Endowment for the Arts has been a platform for
attacks on religion, traditional art forms, traditional families
and traditional values, and a forum for the promotion of homosexuality.
 NEA grants greatly influence what is presented in museums and
theaters and what private donors feel is worthy of support.  As
former NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer noted: &quot;Our grantees
state unequivocally that fund-raising is substantially easier
because of an Endowment grant.  It is an endorsement-a mark of
quality and achievement.&quot;[15] In 1994, the private sector donated
more than $9.6 billion to the arts.
<P>
<LI>The Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial Fine Arts Center located
on the Campus of Bethune Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida
received a grant of $4 million from the Department of Education.
 The facility will allow students to be trained for the fields
of entertainment and hotel management, fields adequately covered
by the private sector.[16]
<P>
<LI>The Essential Air Service Program (EASP) was created in 1978
to continue air service to small communities.  EASP will spend
$28 million in 1996 subsidizing commuter service to 80 communities.
 It was initially authorized for a ten-year period.  The subsidies
that these airlines receive from taxpayers range from $5 to $320
per passenger.[17]
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>BOARDS, COMMISSIONS, AUTHORITIES TO BE ELIMINATED (269)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Similarly, it is difficult to justify deficit spending to support
many federal boards, commissions, and authorities.  Among those
the House GOP wants to delete are:
<UL>
<LI>The Interstate Commerce Commission was created in 1887 to
oversee the rail industry.  It now oversees rail traffic, trucking,
barges, buses, freight forwarders and express companies.   Legislation
that deregulated transportation has increased competition and
made the ICC largely obsolete.[18]
<P>
<LI>The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) was created in 1965
to fight poverty.  It is one of 62 federal economic development
programs under 18 federal departments and agencies.  ARC is currently
funded at $200 million.[19]
<P>
<LI>The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was created in 1933 to
generate and distribute electric power for the Tennessee Valley.
 Today, TVA manages locks, dams and recreation areas, operates
a research center, and funds economic development.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES TO BE PRIVATIZED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Rather than believing worthwhile public functions must be performed
by government, the House GOP Budget plan recognizes that commercial
activities ought to be privatized.  Specifically:
<UL>
<LI>The Department of Energy operates five Power Marketing Administrations
which sell electricity from 131 dams.  In 1994, the PMA's sold
$3 billion worth of electric power.  The Budget Committee recommends
selling four of the PMA's, which are not a profitable investment
for the taxpayer.[20] 
<P>
<LI>The Naval Petroleum Reserves were established in 1912 by Presidents
William Howard Taft and Woodwork Wilson to assure fuel for the
Navy.  The project oversees two commercial oil fields and an oil-shale
reserve.  Studies show that these facilities operate far less
efficiently than comparable privately-owned fields.[21]
<P>
<LI>The United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC)  produces
and markets uranium enrichment services to private utilities in
the U.S. and abroad.  USEC advertises that it serves &quot;approximately
90 percent of the domestic market and about 40 percent of the
world market.&quot;[22] This taxpayer- financed commercial enterprise
could be sold for profit and operated more efficiently through
privatization.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Individually, these programmatic cuts may not amount to much;
 but collectively these changes translate into hundreds of billions
of taxpayer savings and a balanced federal budget by 2002.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The rates in columns 2 and 3 are defined as abortions per
1,000 females on AFDC.  The twelve months prior to implementation
of the cap are August 1992 through July 1993.  The cap took effect
August of 1993, and the most recent monthly data available are
March 1994 because of a time lag in reporting.</FONT>
<P>
<HR><P>
Together with all who decry abortion, the Family Research Council
reacted with concern to press reports Tuesday that New Jersey
experienced a &quot;slight increase in the abortion rate among
women on welfare during the first eight months since implementation
of the family cap.&quot;[1]
<P>
We were relieved to discover for ourselves and are now eager
to reassure fellow pro-life advocates that the data released do
not support the conclusion that the family cap has increased abortions.
<P>
Of course, no one can ascribe causality to the family cap, no
matter how the abortion rate appears to have changed.  Officials
from the New Jersey Department of Human Services themselves stress
emphatically that &quot;additional data and analysis are required
before any link can be made between the family cap and the abortion
rate.&quot;[2]
<P>
The much more immediate problem, however, is that the numbers
just released do not describe a consistent upward trend in abortions
as the accompanying press release suggested -- and the newspapers
then hastened to report.  Instead, the raw numbers indicate that
there is no real change in the rates, other than the normal month-to-month
fluctuation that would be expected regardless of the cap.   
<P>
Jacqueline Tencza, spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of
Human Services, herself cautioned that &quot;the department does
not believe that the [perceived] increase is statistically significant
[i.e., other than a normal distribution of values] because it
is based on a short period of time and compared with only one
previous year.&quot;[3]
<P>
Upon closer scrutiny, the alleged &quot;increase in the abortion
rate&quot; is strictly a function of the particular eight-month
time period isolated for analysis.
<P>
The abortion rate for the month of March 1994 (or March 1993)
is noticeably and significantly greater than any other rate included
in the chart, in part because the month of March contains 23 weekdays
as opposed to the average 21.7 days.  Excluding that one anomalous
rate yields a total monthly average of 9.44 for the period following
implementation of the cap -- which is virtually equal to the pre-cap
average monthly abortion rate of 9.43.
<P>
Examining the pre-cap and post-cap numbers month by month helps
underscore the fact that a straightforward comparison of the two
8-month averages listed in the chart is meaningless.  Three of
the eight months before implementation of the cap in fact posted
a higher abortion rate than the corresponding months in the year
after the cap took effect.
<P>
The waters grow considerably murkier, moreover, when calculations
of average monthly abortion rates include the rates for the four
pre-implementation months in 1993 not included in the chart released
Tuesday.  When the rates for these months (10.96 in April 1993;
9.33 in May 1993; 10.9 in June 1993; and 10.34 in July 1993)[4] are
included, the average monthly abortion rate for the entire year
before implementation of the cap is 9.75 -- again, virtually equal
to the average rate for the eight months since the cap (the only
post-cap months for which data are currently available).  It is
possible, in fact, to isolate a different eight-month period prior
to the cap for which the average monthly abortion rate is higher
than the average calculated for the eight months post-cap.[5]
<P>
It would, of course, be foolish to jump to the conclusion that
abortions must have declined in New Jersey since implementation
of the cap -- but no more foolish than it is to conclude that
abortions have definitely increased in New Jersey, based on the
comparison of two 8-month averages.  It is worthwhile to note
in passing that to date the numbers do not exclude the possibility
that abortions have declined slightly since the cap took effect.
<P>
Given what limited data we have, however, it appears most probable
that the New Jersey family cap is essentially abortion-neutral.
 And we can assert with a large measure of confidence that the
fears of a large upsurge in the short-term abortion rate are unfounded.
<P>
But we repeat again, as we have carefully stated in all previous
comments on the family cap:  It is far too premature to draw any
decisive conclusions from the welfare reform experiment in New
Jersey.  Indeed, it would be a travesty for the national debate
over an issue as critical as welfare reform to rise or fall on
the basis of preliminary returns from one state.
<P>
New Jersey, of course, is a worst-case scenario for the family
cap because it is one of the few states that provides public funding
for abortion.  Failure to demonstrate a consistent, upward trend
in the abortion rate in New Jersey in particular confirms that
it is perfectly appropriate for the debate over the family cap
to go forward.  Given the pathologies of our current welfare system,
the debate <I>must</I> go forward.
<P>
Even with the release of the most recent data, there is still
every reason to theorize that the family cap may be functioning
as a new safeguard for the lives of the unborn.  To know whether
the net effect of the family cap is an increase or a decrease
in the abortion rate, we must know the number of abortions performed
on women who have left the state's welfare rolls.  If the cap
encouraged them to become self-sufficient or to seek alternative
means of support for their babies -- as the framers of the policy
intended -- the abortion rate for former welfare mothers may very
well have decreased.  And the total number of abortions in New
Jersey may have declined.  If that proves to be the case, in a
state that provides public funding for abortions, we will have
powerful evidence to predict that the family cap will be actively
anti-abortion in a state that does not fund or otherwise encourage
abortion.    
<P>
Family Research Council, however,  has never maintained that the
legitimacy of the family cap depends on its capacity to reduce
abortions over the short-term.  The current welfare system is
indelibly anti-marital and anti-natal -- peacefully coexisting
with the world's highest abortion rates outside the Eastern Bloc.
 Long-term change may entail some risk of short-term harm, but
the cost of reform must be weighed against the moral cost of perpetuating
a system that destroys the lives of both the born and yet unborn.
<P>
The family cap is the only welfare reform initiative in the Senate
debate that will directly reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which
is strongly correlated with abortion.  Ardent support for the
family cap <I>is</I> the pro-life position because marriage is
the best protection for children both before and after birth.
 Paying women not to have abortions, by contrast, is morally corrupt.

A study of fruit flies by National Institutes of Health scientists
has rekindled the debate over whether homosexuality has a genetic
component. 
<P>
A set of male fruit flies, the study reports, formed mating chains
with each other after their body chemistry was altered.  But a
close look at the study reveals that the most reasonable conclusions
from the evidence are that male and female sex drives are quite
different, and that frenzied males, under certain conditions,
will mate with anything, even other males. 
<P>
Writing in the June 1995 <I>Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences</I>, Shang-Ding Zhang and Ward F. Odenwald of the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke division
of the National Institutes of Health report a heightening of the
sexual activities of fruit flies that had been heat-treated to
reduce levels of the chemical serotonin.[1] Reduction of serotonin
has been linked in other studies to an increase in sexual activity
and same-sex coupling among some animals (rats, cats, and rabbits).[2]

<P>
Media reports, predictably, have exaggerated the actual findings
of the research.  <I>Time,</I> for instance, reported that the
new study &quot;adds to the mounting evidence that homosexuality
has genetic origins....&quot;[3]
<P>
The <I>Time</I> article and other media reports ignore or underreport
key elements of the study that work against the claim that homosexuality
may be hereditary or even partly hereditary.  One finding was
that altered females, the study notes, were not affected in any
discernible way.  
<P>
Another finding -- that normal males resisted sexual advances
by the altered males for up to two hours and then succumbed to
same-sex activity -- indicates strongly that homosexual behavior
is environmentally induced. 
<P>
From the study:
<P>
&quot;At the beginning of chaining periods, in bottles containing
[more than] 80 percent transformants [treated flies], nontransformant
males were observed only at 
the head of fast moving chains where they repeatedly displayed
repelling signals to advancing suitors -- i.e. wing-flicking,
face-kicking, and/or running away....After a 2-hr. exposure to
vigorous transformant courtship, many, if not all, of the nontransformants
were observed courting and inducing courtship.&quot;[4]
<P>
In bottles in which females were present, the females formed defensive
clusters, impeding males' efforts to mate with them.  In one jar
pictured in the article, the females were huddled at the very
bottom while the males formed long lines of sexual activity in
the rest of the jar.  Some of the males did mate with the females,
but the females offered resistance.  
<P>
As the study explains: 
<P>
&quot;Lead males would typically break off their heterosexual
advances after experiencing one or more of her repelling signals...such
as kicking his face and/or running or flying away.  During vigorous
chaining periods, females predominantly grouped together in tight
clusters; however, no female-female courtship was observed in
or outside of these dense packs.&quot;[5]
<P>
The male &quot;homosexual&quot; activity might have had little
to do with preference and merely involve frenzied mating with
the nearest available partner.
<P>
But listen to how <I>Time</I> magazine summarizes the participation
by the &quot;straight&quot; males:
<P>
&quot;While the gays formed their conga lines, the straights stayed
to the side -- but only temporarily.  After a few hours, the straights
joined in and, for the time being, acted gay.&quot;[6]
<P>
No mention is made by <I>Time</I> of the struggle by the &quot;straight&quot;
flies to ward off the hypersexual males.  And the use of the word
&quot;gay&quot; to describe the flies gives them anthropomorphic
overtones; that is, the writer attributes human characteristics
to a non-human rather than vice-versa.  But the notion of being
&quot;gay&quot; is a calculated construct of self-identification
for political purposes.  Many people struggling with homosexuality
reject the idea that their defining characteristic is to be &quot;gay.&quot;[7]
 The <I>Time</I> article does concede that &quot;[t]he type of
gene they've been studying in fruit flies could not begin to account
for the complex variations in human homosexual behavior.  For
one thing, the gene does not cause flies to renounce heterosexuality
altogether.  If a 'gay' fly is surrounded by females instead of
males, he'll fertilize the lady flies.&quot;[8]
<P>
Another culturally significant fact from the study is that when
non-treated male flies constituted 50 percent or more of the population
in a bottle, the researchers found that &quot;little or no chaining
was detected and nontransformant participation was rarely observed.&quot;[9]
<P>
In other words, when the bottle's &quot;culture&quot; was at least
half normal, the male-to-male sex occurred not at all or rarely.
 But when the normal flies were surrounded by &quot;homosexual&quot;
flies and attacked repeatedly, they finally gave in to the behavior.
 Again, it is perilous to extrapolate insect studies to humans,
but this sounds much like experiences reported among convicts.
 Otherwise sexually normal prison inmates sometimes indulge in
homosexual behavior, not because of genetics but because of the
immediate environment (coercion, lack of opposite-sex partners,
peer acceptance of the behavior).  According to psychiatrist and
author Jeffrey B. Satinover, &quot;It is common knowledge that
when some heterosexual men are placed in isolation for long periods
of time with each other that they will engage in homosexual behavior.
 But, once released, they will resume their heterosexual behavior.&quot;[10]
<P>
The social sciences are increasingly looking to animals or insects
for clues to human behavior, even though human sexuality is quite
different.  But if any lessons are to be drawn for human purposes,
they might be these:
<P>
<LI>  The sexes are quite different in their sexual needs, drives
and reactions to particular stimulants.
<P>
<LI>  A culture that hopes to maintain its sexual norms is at risk
when a critical mass of deviant behavior occurs.
<P>
 <LI> Homosexual behavior is learned, and occurs among those who are
vulnerable to the environmental factors that tend to produce homosexual
behavior. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
As with other studies purporting to show a genetic link to homosexuality,
the NIH study is being hailed by homosexual activists, who are
trying to equate homosexuality with an immutable characteristic
such as skin color or ethnic origin in their drive to create support
for an entirely new category of behavior-based special civil rights.
<P>
The actual research often reveals something entirely different
from what is claimed.  Researchers Zhang and Odenwald summarize
that &quot;both genetic and environmental factors play a role
in male sexual behavior[11]....elements of the basic machinery controlling
male sexual behavior may be highly conserved between taxonomically
distinct organisms.&quot;[12] They call for more research on the
topic to &quot;enhance our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms
controlling sexual behavior.&quot;[13]
<P>
The study is interesting.  But it gives no hard evidence of anything
other than the fact that male fruit flies subjected to a sexual
stimulant may mate with anything in sight.  In March 1993, two
Columbia University psychiatrists examined the various studies
purporting to find a homosexual biologic component.   They concluded
that &quot;there is no evidence at present to substantiate a biologic
theory...the appeal of current biologic explanations for sexual
orientation may derive more from dissatisfaction with the present
status of psychosocial explanations than from a substantiating
body of experimental data.&quot;[14]
<P>
In other words, politics, not science, is driving the debate.
 An honest look at the evidence of 70 years of psychology, therapeutic
research, the history of the entire human race, and the moral
codes of all the great civilizations tells us that homosexuality
is not only universally discouraged as learned behavior but can
also be temporary, controlled, or even changed.
<P>
Given the well-documented, socially and medically destructive
effects of homosexual behavior on individuals, families and communities,
compassion and prudence should lead us to discourage any cultural
promotion of homosexuality as a moral and normal activity.  Media
reports indicate that homosexual experimentation among high schoolers
has increased considerably in recent years as schools have presented
homosexual activity as normal, desirable and even &quot;cool.&quot;[15]
 Sexually vulnerable young people are being steered onto a behavioral
path that they and their families will sorely regret and which
will even cost some of them their lives at an early age.
<P>
Homosexual behavior, like other destructive vices, can be learned
-- and unlearned.  Under no circumstances should it be promoted,
particularly through misrepresentation of scientific studies.

<P>
Federal arts funding, much like the welfare system, has created
a class of beneficiaries who are hostile to conservative, pro-family
causes.  Recipients of federal aid all too often become cheerleaders
for big government, the family's natural enemy.  Big government
strips families of their incomes through confiscatory taxation
and diminishes their autonomy through intrusive social welfare
and educational programs designed to wean children from their
parents (and parental values) at earlier and earlier ages. 
<P>
The same taxpayers who suffer the indignity of seeing their own
earnings used by bureaucrats to undermine their families also
pay for a federally-subsidized artistic and media elite to cheer
on their tormentors: the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment
for the Humanities.
<P>
It is long past time that the federal arts and humanities endowments
be de-authorized and de-funded.  Spawned during the 1960s' Great
Society years, these agencies, despite whatever good they have
done, have damaged American culture, ripped off the taxpayer,
waged war on the family and religion, and politicized the academy
and the arts.   
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CURRENT PROPOSALS TO TRIM THE ENDOWMENTS ARE ILL-ADVISED AND
COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Merely cutting the budgets and stretching out the life of the
agencies will cause more mischief.  When Proposition 13 was enacted
into law in California, hostile government officials began cutting
back on essentials, such as police and fire departments, leaving
the waste and fat untouched.  The object lesson to the voters
was that challenging government growth meant the onset of anarchy.
 Similarly, if the federal budgets for public broadcasting and
the arts and humanities are merely reduced, the truly offensive
offerings will be the last to be de-funded.  Vengeful bureaucrats
will trim where it will cause the most pain and where patrons
would complain most loudly.  A couple of years ago, when Congress
stalled in passing an appropriations bill for the federal government,
the Smithsonian closed its 
doors, as did some national parklands, enraging taxpaying visitors.
 But the long-obsolete federal Helium Reserve suffered no loss
of gas.  Again, the message to the voters was:  we will punish
you if you don't lobby your elected representatives to reinstate
our funding -- with increases. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SOME POLITICIANS THINK THEY CAN BUY PEACE BY APPEASING THEIR
OPPONENT. INSTEAD, THEY CREATE A HARDENED ENEMY.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In terms of the federal endowments, the political price is actually
higher for merely cutting instead of eliminating them.  Recipients
of federal aid are the natural foes of budget cutters and will
continue to use their taxpayer-provided subsidies to wage political
war on them.  Hundreds of arts organizations are being lobbied
to bring pressure on individual members of Congress to preserve
art pork in their own districts.
<P>
A case in point is a letter from Independent Television Service
Executive Director James Yee to public broadcasting advocates.
 The taxpayer-supported (and, therefore, in no way independent)
ITVS was created in 1988 to provide new programming for public
broadcasting.  Yee urges his &quot;independent colleagues&quot;
to &quot;become involved in future efforts to drum up support
for public broadcasting, especially with your local and national
elected officials....&quot;  Yee warns that &quot;an extensive
informational outreach campaign will have to be waged.&quot; 
Such campaigns cost money, but are easier to mount when federal
subsidies pour in to handle other costs.  
<P>
The current House plan to phase out the endowments serves only
to give welfare artists some time to restore their subsidies.
 Indeed, subsidy supporters have acknowledged, through their accord,
that the phase-out plan is their best hope for saving the agencies
and returning to business as usual.[1] 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CUTTING BACK THE ENDOWMENTS WILL NOT LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT REFORM.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Congress repeatedly has slapped NEA on the wrist, and still the
NEA sends money to The Kitchen, Franklin Furnace and other centers
of blatantly offensive &quot;performance&quot; art that denigrates
religion, families and traditional morality.  Indeed, a <I>Washington
Post</I> critic observed recently that the 1993 Biennial Exhibition
at the NEA-funded Whitney Museum was &quot;one long whinging [sic]
whine of political correctness, suggesting as it did that the
only art that counts is art produced by lesbians, inhabitants
of barrios, sufferers of AIDS and others on the margin.&quot;
 Two years later, at the 1995 Biennial, &quot;[h]omosexuality's
still hot, especially the kinds involving punctures of the flesh,
accessories of leather, bondage and cross-dressing, but so too
are the subtlest of painterly abstraction.  Nuances and nipple-rings
are both themes of this exhibit, if it can be said to have any
themes at all.&quot;[2]
<P>
NEA chairwoman Jane Alexander has boasted of using the endowment
to promote homosexual themes[3] and has even defended a public bloodletting
by an HIV-infected  performer at an NEA-subsidized venue.[4]  Despite
many assurances by past and present NEA officials that excellence
and artistic merit are the criteria for grant allocation, this
is clearly not the case.  More than $9 billion in private giving
sustains arts in communities all over America.[5] The NEA's $175
million is important more for its symbolism than for the actual
dollars involved.  An NEA grant validates an artist, and the government
should not be putting its imprimatur on much of the anti-family,
anti-religious propaganda that counter-culture activists brazenly
categorize as art.  The entertainment industry has revenues in
the tens of billions of dollars  each year.  Time-Warner alone
took in $15.9 billion during 1994.  Clearly, Hollywood is in a
better position to subsidize the endowments for arts and humanities
than US taxpayers who struggling to get out from under $200 billion
in annual deficits.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting
Act creating CPB.  The agency oversees the Public Broadcasting
Service, which was formed in 1969, a year before the creation
of National Public Radio.  CPB's total appropriation in fiscal
1969 was $5 million.  In 1992, Congress re-authorized CPB with
a three-year, $1.1 billion appropriation.  By 1993, CPB's annual
federal appropriation was $318.6 million, which rose to $386 million
for fiscal 1995.  There are 349 public TV stations and 200 TV
grantees receiving CPB funding.[6]  PBS claims to reach 1.8 million
teachers and 29.5 million students through educational programming
and services, and 97 million Americans overall each week with
some PBS programming.[7] National Public Radio is carried on 595
stations, and CPB awards money to 391 public radio grantees. 
<P>
The basis for CPB's existence has always been an anti-free market
philosophy.   Proponents have said that the market is incapable
of providing good programming, so the government must step in
and do it, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars annually.[8]
 Yet the shows that register high ratings on PBS turn out to be
the very programs that the public perceives to be excellent: <I>Sesame
Street</I>, <I>Barney and Friends</I>, <I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I>,
and <I>Masterpiece Theatre</I>, for example.  All of these shows
are generating more than sufficient revenue from sponsors, donors,
grants and product marketing.  They do not need taxpayer subsidies.
<P>
But there is other CPB programming that probably would fail to
attract a sufficient viewing/listening audience or donor support.
 These programs are so bad that their creators must dig into the
public purse.  Subsidizing bad art is a donor's prerogative, of
course -- unless the &quot;donor&quot; is the taxpayer, who has
no choice.  (For detailed examples, see FRC's Policy paper entitled
&quot;Public Broadcasting?  Let's Free Big Bird.&quot;)
<P>
<CENTER><H3> NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
NEA was established in 1965 when President Johnson signed the
National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act, which also
created the National Endowment for the Humanities.  NEA's initial
budget was $2.5 million, but grew over the years to about $175
million annually (fiscal 1995 appropriation is $167.7 million).
 A fiscal 1995 rescission bill, HR 1158, would reduce 1995 funding
to $162.5 million.[9] All told, NEA has spent more than $3 billion
of tax money in its 30-year history.   
<P>
The plan approved by the House Economic and Educational Opportunities
Committee on May 10, 1995 would reauthorize NEA through fiscal
1998 but eliminate funding in fiscal 1999.  Funding would be reduced
by 40 percent in fiscal 1996, another 40 percent in fiscal 1997
and by 20 percent in fiscal 1998. The NEA would get no money in
fiscal 1999.[10]
<P>
NEA would also face a $5 million cap on administrative expenses,
which would entail an 80 percent reduction in budget for staff.
 Currently, NEA spends $24 million annually on administration.[11]
<P>
Beginning in 1996, grants to individuals would be eliminated,
with all grants going to institutions.  Eighty percent of annual
appropriations to the state art councils would be in the form
of block grants.[12]
<P>
A Senate bill (S 856) introduced by James Jeffords (R-VT) and
co-sponsored by Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), Alan Simpson (R-WY), Edward
Kennedy (D-MA) and Claiborne Pell (D-RI) would reauthorize NEA
for five years (FY 1996-2000) at gradually reduced funding levels.
 Forty percent of the NEA's program budget would go to &quot;partnership&quot;
grants with the states, local and regional groups; 40% more would
go toward organizations of &quot;national significance;&quot;
a final 20% would go to direct grants to organizations, such as
theaters or museums, and to individual artists. 
<P>
Most significantly, the bill keeps intact much of the current
peer review system, in which panelists award federal tax dollars
to their friends and associates.  It also locks in place the conditions
under which the NEA would reject a grant over &quot;obscenity.&quot;
 An artwork would have to be found legally obscene in a court
of law before the NEA could move to recover funds.  Given that
a grant from the NEA automatically gives an artwork &quot;artistic&quot;
significance no matter how offensive, the provision is meaningless
in terms of curbing abuses of taxpayer funding.  
<P>
The bill also directs the current NEA director to give &quot;Distinguished
Lifetime Service for the Arts&quot; awards to &quot;each of the
former Chairpersons of the Endowment.&quot;  This means that federal
taxpayers would honor, among others, John Frohnmayer, the NEA
chief whose tenure ended when he was forced by President Bush
to resign over NEA's continued funding of anti-Christian and pornographic
works. 
<P>
Finally, the bill creates an entirely new federal agency to nationalize
standards for all public libraries and museums.  The &quot;Institute
for Museum and Library Services&quot; would be authorized for
five years, beginning with a budget of $75 million in fiscal 1996
&quot;and such sums as may be necessary for each of the 4 succeeding
fiscal years,&quot; and would have grant-making authority.  This
is a potentially lucrative source to be abused by well-connected
left-wing groups like the American Library Association, would
give the federal government potential control over the nation's
local public libraries, and would do to libraries and museums
what the NEA has done to art -- redefine it using federal tax
dollars to further a radical cultural and political agenda. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES</H3></CENTER>
<P>
NEH was established at the same time NEA was born, in 1965.  The
fiscal year 1966 budget was $5.9 million, and the agency had a
staff of 13.[13] The agency expanded over the years until it reached
a budget of $177 million in fiscal 1995.  
<P>
Officials at the NEH are hardly contrite for sponsoring a widely-denounced
set of national history standards that, among other things, emphasize
the role of the Ku Klux Klan (17 references) and exalt Soviet
advances in space while ignoring Albert Einstein, the Wright Brothers,
Paul Revere, Robert E. Lee and the American moon landing.[14] The
NEH also specializes in promoting cultural relativism, feminist
studies and other Marxist and neo-Marxist theoretical quagmires
on the nation's campuses.[15]
<P>
The current plan approved by the House Economic and Educational
Opportunities Committee would reauthorize NEH with an annual 20
percent funding reduction through fiscal 1998 starting with the
1995 appropriation of $172 million (which includes a recent House-approved
$5 million rescission).  No funding would be allocated to NEH
in 1999.  The 5 percent cap for administrative expenses would
also apply to NEH, as well as the termination of direct federal
grants to individuals (scholars would continue to receive grants
through recipient organizations such as universities).  Eighty
percent of appropriations would go to state humanities councils
in the form of block grants.  Senate bill S 856 would reauthorize
NEH for five years at gradually reduced funding levels, beginning
with $168.6 million in fiscal year 1996.  Each state would get
a minimum of $200,000 in funding each fiscal year.  Grants would
continue to be made to &quot;groups, individuals, and State agencies
or entities.&quot;

<CENTER><H3>SUMMARY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Attempts to curry favor with the welfare broadcast media and arts
groups are useless and only embolden the political enemies of
budget cutters.  So, we must ask budget-cutting Members of Congress:
why give the very people who will never love you enough subsidies
to stay in business so they can continue taking shots at you?
 The federal arts subsidies must end once and for all.

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD SUMMIT FOR<br>
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT TAKES ON THE FAMILY</h2>

What follows is a commentary on the &quot;Draft Declaration and
Draft Programme of Action&quot; prepared by United Nations staff
for the &quot;World Summit for Social Development&quot; scheduled to
occur in Copenhagen March 6-12, 1995.  This commentary is indicative
of problems found in the document, which runs some 55 pages in
typescript, and which addresses, in generally broad language,
a wide range of social issues and concerns in member countries
of the United Nations.  This commentary will be updated after
Copenhagen to discuss the final language of the Declaration and
Programme of Action.    
<P>
<center><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3></center>
<P>
Following the United Nations and its swamp of commissions, declarations,
and conferences can be a debilitating experience.  The situation
is compounded by the rapidly growing basket of UN documents and
observances devoted to such topics as the family (International
Year of the Family, 1994), population and development (International
Conference on Population and Development, 1994), social development
(World Summit for Social Development, 1995), and women (Fourth
World Conference on Women, 1995).    
<P>
Thematically and administratively separate, these observances
and conferences tend to overlap in subject matter.  This is due
in part to the ambiguity of mission in many UN agencies and documents,
and the tendency of recent UN meetings to produce &quot;smorgasbord&quot;
documents that say in 1,000 words what more succinct documents
(like those of the American founding) say in 10.  Thus, for example,
the bitter dispute over abortion at the ICPD in Cairo in 1994
is likely to be reprised at the Beijing women's conference and
its preliminary meetings.              
<P>
An additional factor promoting these disputes is the continued
presence and agitation within the UN structure of international
lobbies (some with economic ties to the UN, and others privately
funded) devoted to particular agendas.  The United Nations Charter
(for example, Chapter X, Article 71, relating to the Economic
and  Social Council) makes specific provision for consultation
by the UN and its constituent councils and agencies &quot;with
nongovernmental organizations [NGOs] which are concerned with
matters within its competence.&quot;  
<P>
The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is responsible for conducting
all events in connection with the World Summit for Social Development.
<P>
NGOs vary in the amount and type of energy they devote to UN activities.
 Essentially, they  are private, charitable (i.e., tax exempt)
or advocacy organizations that are accredited by the UN  to lobby
at particular conferences and the preparatory meetings leading
up to them.  In the context of Cairo and Beijing, NGOs such as
the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF)  and the
Women's Environmental and Developmental Organization (WEDO) have
exerted continuous pressure, with considerable internal UN support,
for the drafting of documents that  strongly endorse abortion,
the redefinition of the family, and other radical causes.    
<P>
Preparatory meetings leading up to designated international conferences
are called, in UN lingo, &quot;prepcoms.&quot;  Major prepcoms
for both the Cairo population conference and the Beijing women's
summit have been held months in advance at the United Nations
headquarters in New York.  The prepcoms are run by &quot;Preparatory
Committees,&quot; composed of representatives of member nations
of the UN.  In between sessions of the prepcom, the Committee
chairman, with  the assistance of the UN Secretariat, may be tasked
with such responsibilities as the drafting of  declarations and
programmes of action.  The periods between prepcoms are invaluable,
especially to New Yorkbased NGOs, as opportunities to lobby UN
officials and to influence the development of conference documents.
<P>
With respect to the World Summit for Social Development, a second
session of the prepcom  was held in New York from August 22 to
September 2, 1994.  At that session, the committee  tasked its
chairman to prepare a declaration for consideration in Copenhagen.
 The UN Secretariat was charged by the committee to prepare a
programme of action for Copenhagen.  The analysis that follows
discusses the draft declaration and programme of action of November
22, 1994, as prepared by the chairman and the Secretariat.  As
of this writing, a final draft is in the process of  being completed
for submission to the summit in Copenhagen.    
<P>
That the United Nations is an incessant document mill has become
increasingly obvious.  The  November 22 draft, as discussed below,
incorporates a wealth of vague and contradictory ideas,  not the
least of which is the situational irony of a massive United Nations
bureaucracy proclaiming itself the savior of decentralized government.
 But, the question may be asked, are not most UN documents merely
recommendations, without the force of law?  Indeed, the design
of the  Economic and Social Council announced in the UN Charter
is precisely that of a body constituted to hold meetings and make
recommendations.  Article 62 defines the powers of ECOSOC as 
follows:                 
<P>
1.  The Economic and Social Council may make or initiate studies
and reports with respect to international economic, social, cultural,
educational, health, and related matters and may make recommendations
with respect to any such matters to the General Assembly, to the
Members of the United Nations, and to the specialized (UN) agencies
concerned.                  
<P>
2.  [ECOSOC] may make recommendations for the purpose of promoting
respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms
for all.                  
<P>
3.  [ECOSOC] may prepare draft conventions for submission to the
General Assembly ...      
<P>
4.  [ECOSOC] may call, in accordance with rules prescribed by
the United Nations, international conferences on matters falling
within its competence.  This brief Article summarizes the activity
of the ECOSOC with respect to the World Summit  for Social Development
 with one exception.  That is, none of the documents of the Summit
 amount to a convention, a legal instrument that requires the
approval of the General Assembly  and the submission to members
states for ratification.  Examples of such conventions are the
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention for the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  It
is important to realize that the language developed at Copenhagen
for its nonbinding declaration and programme of action will thereby
acquire momentum within the UN system, and perhaps form the basis
for future conventions with potentially legally binding force.
<P>
<center><h3>WEDO AND THE GLEN COVE CONCLAVE</h3></center>
<P>
It is this possibility that motivates the activities of the most
intensely involved NGOs, such as  the Women's Environmental and
Development Organization (WEDO).  Former Democratic Congresswoman
Bella Abzug, a privatecitizen member of the US delegation to the
Cairo population conference, is the leader of WEDO.  An uncompromising
feminist and abortion advocate, Abzug  represented WEDO at a November
29 to December 2, 1994 planning meeting for the Beijing women's
conference.  This global strategy meeting was held in Glen Cove,
New York.  While  focused primarily on Beijing, the meeting included
working groups focused on devising strategies and language for
the whole basket of UN conferences and documents in progress.
 In that context, many of its recommendations are instructive.
<P>
The Glen Cove working group on the Copenhagen document criticized
it for its focus &quot;on the  family as the basic unit&quot;
of society, and for overlooking &quot;the changing configuration
of the  family.&quot;  The working group called for women's housework
to be remunerated, for a &quot;universal  adequate annual guaranteed
income,&quot; and &quot;payment for childcare.&quot;  It also
called for the adoption of a tax on &quot;international financial
transactions&quot; and &quot;taxation of transnational corporations&quot;
to  finance social development, presumably under UN auspices.
 (In this regard, the November 22 Copenhagen draft recommends
that the General Assembly task the ECOSOC to study such  proposals.)
<P>
The working group proposed a number of changes to the Copenhagen
draft (See full text of  the November 22 draft in the Appendix).
 The changes include a subtle call for changes in electoral systems
to establish a &quot;mechanism for women's ... equitable representation
at all levels of  the political process.&quot;  Other language
developed at Glen Cove suggests this &quot;mechanism&quot; would
 include gender quotas for public office.  In addition, the working
group proposed that the  Copenhagen document ensure &quot;that
effective laws and agencies exist to prevent and eliminate  discrimination
on the basis of gender [and] sexual orientation ...&quot;; &quot;that
women and adolescents  have access to good quality, comprehensive
health care, including the full range of reproductive  and sexual
health care services, including access to safe abortion ...&quot;;
and that the draft's  language regarding &quot;family as the basic
unit of society&quot; be replaced with references to &quot;households
and families&quot; as &quot;important economic units.&quot;  
<P>
The Glen Cove working group recommendations for Beijing are also
revealing.  The group  called for the &quot;recognition of sexual
orientation as a fundamental human right within the context  of
the expanding definition of the family.&quot;  It also called
for &quot;sexual and reproductive education to [sic] boys and
girls&quot;; affirmative action to assure that &quot;governments
... achieve 50% representation in elected and appointed office
by women by the year 2005,&quot; to be achieved by &quot;setting
 targets or quota systems&quot;; and encouraging &quot;activities
aimed at changing traditional decisionmaking roles in the family.&quot;
 One specific action recommended by the working group is that
the UN Secretariat prepare a &quot;gender balance rating card&quot;
to be published at the beginning of each session of the General
Assembly &quot;rating and ranking Member States on the basis of
numbers, positions, titles, race and ethnicity of women participating
in their Missions to [the] UN ...&quot;      
<P>
Other working groups dealt with the aftermath of the Cairo population
conference and discussed ways to expand the advances made in promoting
the notion of &quot;reproductive health and  decisionmaking&quot;
as aspects of fundamental human rights, including possibly adolescents
and  single people.  The goal remains to assure that abortion
is included in future UN documents &quot;as a  basic method of
fertility regulation and as an essential part of reproductive
health services and  rights.&quot;    
<P>
Finally, Working Group 2 at Glen Cove developed a program of lobbying
and other activities  to be undertaken between the Copenhagen
and Beijing meetings.  The program is entitled the  &quot;Women's
Global Campaign, 180 Days, 180 Ways.&quot;  The campaign's goal
is to extend the statements of belief and programs of action of
the Glen Cove coalition to a wider network of women,  NGOs and
&quot;disenfranchised people.&quot;  Expanded usage of online
computer networks is  envisioned.  All of this is in keeping with
a recognition that the topdown organization of social  movements
by such bodies as the United Nations are doomed to failure if
it cannot enlist the  support of a grassroots movement in member
nations.                                      
<P>
The Glen Cove conclave amounted to a gathering of radical feminists
rebuffed politically in the  United States but rewarded in the
closed environment of New York and the United Nations,  funded
and supported by a variety of such populist funding sources as
the Ford, and Rockefeller  Foundations, and abetted by the swelling
throng of UN and Clinton Administration bureaucrats  dedicated
to adopting the sexual revolution on a global scale.  With each
new UN conference and  document, they have another opportunity
to move the international clock in the direction of their  Brave
New World.    
<P>
<center><h3>ANALYSIS OF NOVEMBER 22 COPENHAGEN DRAFT</h3></center>
<P>
All page numbers refer to the November 22, 1994 draft declaration
and &quot;programme of  action.&quot;  The actual text of the
draft declaration reviewed begins on page 3 and concludes at page
 55.  Most paragraphs in the declaration are identifiable by numbers
or letter designations in the  text, and these designations are
used in this commentary.  Language that is objectionable is  indicated
by brackets [ ].  Language to be added or substituted for objectionable
language is indicated in bold.    
<P>
Suggested modifications follow.    
<P>
Page 3, paragraph 2.  Modify line two to read &quot;profound social
problems specially poverty,  unemployment, family breakup and
social exclusion.&quot;  The phenomenon of family dissolution
is  a virtually universal concomitant of development; indeed,
it is especially pronounced in the most highly developed nations
as individuals tend to supplant family (agrarian) units as the
primary  sources of production.  Asserting the problem of family
breakup at the outset of the document  will serve to buttress
family preservation as an essential component of development throughout
 the declaration.    
<P>
Page 3, paragraph 4.  &quot;Peace and security&quot; are insufficient
descriptors of national aspirations.   This paragraph should be
modified to read &quot;the achievement and maintenance of conditions
of  freedom, peace and security with and between ... cannot be
attained in the absence of conditions of freedom, peace and security.&quot;
 This language is needed to express the basic condition  of political
freedom as the key to economic and human progress.  Conditions
of &quot;peace and  security,&quot; at least in the military sense,
prevailed in Soviet Russia and numerous authoritarian  regimes
of East Asia, Africa, and the Americas.  Peace and security alone
are insufficient conditions for human wellbeing and development.
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 11, line 2.  The word &quot;contradiction&quot;
should be modified to read &quot;contrast.&quot;  This distinction
may not carry over well in other languages besides English, but
it is important that the document not be read to assert that in
every case the expansion of prosperity occurs for some at the
expense of the poverty of others.   All wealth is not the product
of exploitation.  Were it so, development by definition would
be a zero sum game in which no real improvement in overall global
living standards is possible.  The declaration must reject this
notion in principle. &quot;Contrast&quot; better suggests the
morally troubling existence of stark inequities in the distribution
of the world's basic resources.    
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 12, line 3,  The word &quot;people&quot; or
&quot;peoples&quot; appears to be missing after  &quot;Globalization
also permits.&quot;    
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 14, subparagraph a, line 2, add the following
language:  &quot;the gap between rich and poor, aggravated by
cultural factors and social mores, has increased.&quot;  This
addition recognizes that the economic gap between rich and poor
is not purely an economic phenomenon. In the United States, for
example, families headed by a single parent are five times more
likely to be poor than are families headed by two parents.  Casual
attitudes regarding divorce and sexual activity outside of marriage
have fueled these inequities.    
<P>
Page 6, paragraph (h).  Language is needed here to suggest, as
economically as possible, that &quot;family,&quot; while expressed
in different cultural and legal terms in many countries, nonetheless
has an archetypal and crosscultural meaning.  If we can speak
of &quot;equity and equality&quot; between men and women at various
points in the document, we can also make clear that the family
is an archetypal arrangement of man and woman, and their offspring,
and others related to them by  blood, marriage and adoption. 
<P>
Page 7, paragraph 21.  This paragraph needs to be strengthened
to include recognition of due  principles of subsidiarity and
of the possibility that government, even when wellmeaning, may
 overreach and become the principal obstacle to the attainment
of development.  Thus, language  should be added which states:
 We acknowledge the [primary] special responsibility of  governments,
particularly those units of government closest to and most accountable
to the  people, to attain these goals.  We also acknowledge that
they cannot be achieved by government  alone, and that, indeed,
governments may hinder development by overinvolvement in and 
disruption of healthy social and economic activity.    
<P>
Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph b.  Modify to read:  &quot;the
provision of primary health care  and the promotion of reproductive
health and voluntary and informed family planning for  married
couples, reinforcement of the social and legal significance of
the archetypal family unit, safe drinking water ...&quot;  Addition
of &quot;voluntary&quot; is necessary to affirm the right of couples
to reject the &quot;provision&quot; of family planning; reference
to the marital couple is a natural correlative  of the term &quot;family&quot;
in family planning.  The role of the dissolution of the family
in fostering  intractable poverty is described above.    
<P>
Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph c.  &quot;access to land, credit&quot;
should be modified to read  &quot;opportunity to acquire land,
credit ...&quot;  The emphasis must be on expanded opportunities,
and  the United Nations should make clear that it is not endorsing
policies of expropriation and confiscation of lawfully acquired
and owned resources.                                        
<P>
Page 9, commitment 4, subparagraph a.  &quot;Promote basic values
of respect for pluralism and  diversity, tolerance and responsibility,
political and personal freedom, nonviolence and solidarity ...&quot;
<P>
Page 10, commitment 4, subparagraph e:  &quot;central role of
the archetypal family.&quot; 
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph b:  &quot;Establish policies
[objectives and measurable goals] to  enhance gender balance.&quot;
 This language clearly stipulates the formulation of quotas for
political representation of women, presumably created and enforced
by the United Nations and its instrumentalities.  As such, this
language is at war with the declaration's expressed commitment
to respect for national sovereignty and decentralization of developmental
initiatives.  Moreover, it is  false in principle.  The key to
equity and equality is opportunity.  Government policies should
 indeed guarantee such opportunities, and those governments that
do so will reap the richest rewards in diverse and freely chosen
representation.  Republican forms of government are incompatible
with quotas, and republican forms are precisely those that have
proven most resilient in  expanding political participation by
all citizens.    
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph c.  In this context, there
is no reason to exclude men from protections against &quot;exploitation,
abuse and violence.&quot;  Violence against entrepreneurs in the
 United States, for example, frequently takes the form of attacks
upon disfavored ethnic groups  engaged in lawful business activity
in the cities.  Prejudice and violence against citizens of foreign
extraction is also common in many countries.  Both of these types
of phenomena are severe hindrances to the development of small
enterprises in economically depressed communities.  The selective
nature of much of this violence against men certifies it as an
issue of equity and equality.  Therefore, the subparagraph should
read:  &quot;Take effective measures to eliminate all kinds of
 exploitation, abuse and violence against men and women, with
particular attention to  immigrants, [women] refugees, and [women]
noncombatants in situations of armed conflict.&quot;    
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph d.  &quot;Encourage the ratification,
[removal of reservations,]  and implementation of all provisions
...&quot;  The United Nations is to be expected to encourage the
 ratification of international instruments approved by the General
Assembly.  Reservations, however, are a critical mechanism by
which sovereign nations adduce understandings that protect  important
cultural and legal values and policies.  In this particular regard,
reservations in many  nations preserve understandings regarding
special protections for women and mothers, and for  their offspring,
born and unborn.  The language as written is once again at war
with the declaration's commitment to respect national sovereignty.
 It is intrusive and should be modified as noted.    
<P>
Page 11, subparagraph d.  &quot;Increase official development
assistance, both in total and for social  programs, without coercion
or reducing the resources allocated to other sectors.&quot;  This
language is needed to address the continuing problem of assistance
linkage:  the withholding or threatened withholding of assistance
funds from nations which do not conform national policies to donor
nation's preferences in such areas as population control.  Addition
of coercion or reinforces the declaration's commitment to national
sovereignty.    
<P>
Page 11, commitment 7, subparagraph a.  &quot;Protect basic social
programs and expenditures, in  particular, those affecting the
weakest and most vulnerable segments of society, from acrosstheboard
budget reductions, while eliminating inefficient spending and
perverse incentives against work and family formation, and increasing
the quality of social expenditures.&quot;    
<P>
Page 12, commitment 8, subparagraph d.  &quot;Ensure that taxation
systems are fair, [and] economically efficient, and nonpunitive,&quot;
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 4.  &quot;Social development is also clearly
linked to the development of peace, freedom, stability and security
...  to promote social development requires a reorientation of
values, objectives, and priorities, in order to strengthen or
reform existing institutions and  policies.  Human dignity, [equity]
equal opportunity, freedom  and social justice must be ...&quot;
 The rationale for each of these suggested changes is outlined
in similar contexts above.  Note that the strengthening of all
existing institutions should clearly not be the objective of the
United  Nations in this declaration.  Many national institutions,
both private and public are, in fact,  destructive of human wellbeing.
 The declaration itself calls for reform of multilateral lending
 policies to the most debtridden nations.  No one, for example,
should support strengthening of  the UNFPA, which has exhibited
warm relations with national governments employing population
policies deeply destructive of human life and human freedom. 
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 5.  &quot;This same global community is threatened
by environmental degradation, epidemics, various forms of intolerance,
attacks and stresses upon the archetypal family unit, sexual exploitation
and the drug trade, violence and criminality . . . &quot;    
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 7.  &quot;Gender equity and equality of opportunity
[and the full participation of  women] in all economic, social
and political activities is essential.&quot;  Besides being redundant
as  written, this phrase could be abused to discourage governmental
policies that protect full or parttime homemakers and that permit
them to freely choose the terms of their participation in  economic
and other activities.  The right of families to establish their
own patterns of workfamily  involvement must be affirmed.  Another
alternative here is to change the word &quot;full&quot; to &quot;open.&quot;
  Ask yourself this question:  which nation of the world has the
fullest participation of women in  economic activities?  Clearly,
it is the People's Republic of China, with its cadres and worker
 brigades.  Free nations typically exhibit much more diverse and
complex arrangements, with equality of opportunity guaranteed
and norms of participation left to individual and family choice
and capability.  This is the more socially just and free condition.
<P>
Page 17, bulleted items:  Add &quot;a strengthened role for the
archetypal family, churches and  private associations for selfbetterment;&quot;
and &quot;public policies that discourage illegal and/or  selfdestructive
behaviors that shorten lifespan and/or reduce productivity.&quot;
 The latter  language should be unexceptionable; it is aimed at
such practices as smoking, drug abuse, and  activities that transmit
HIV and other diseases.  The impact of these factors on human
lifespan, productivity, and development is clearly massive.  
 
<P>
Page 18, paragraph 11, add a subparagraph e:  Promoting the expansion
of political freedom in the context of transitions to market economies,
and directing development assistance to smallscale and private
ventures that maximize individual creativity and initiative. 
<P>
Page 19, paragraph 13, subparagraph e:  &quot;... and ensuring
that subsidy systems benefit people in  poverty, avoid incentives
to nonproductive lifestyles and family breakup, and reduce disparities.&quot;
As noted above, family breakup is a key determinant and perpetuator
of poverty; subsidy  (welfare) programs should avoid designs that
punish intact families and reward illegitimacy.    
<P>
Page 19, paragraph 13, subparagraph g:  &quot;Assisting developing
canters and countries in transition to establish efficient, nonpunitive
and fair tax collection systems.&quot;    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph a:  &quot;Ensuring that institutions
 public, private, and  natural, including the family unit  and
agencies responsible for the design and implementation ...&quot;
 This language eliminates any possible bias toward governmental
institutions as  opposed to private and natural institutions engaged
in critical social development, primarily the family, business,
and religious denominations.    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph b:  The phrase &quot;full
transparency ... for all ... private  institutions&quot; raises
important questions for private associations, including churches,
which are  generally accorded far more freedom of action than
governmental and quasigovernmental  institutions that operate
with public funds.  This subparagraph should be amended to include
 language respecting the privacy rights of voluntary and religious
institutions except insofar as  necessary to meet generally accepted
standards of accountability under the laws of each nation.   Without
such language, private institutions are vulnerable to treatment
as publicly owned entities.  Therefore, add &quot;Nothing in this
subparagraph shall be construed to diminish the right of  voluntary
and religious institutions to appropriate privacy protections
consistent with generally accepted standards of accountability
under the law.&quot;    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph c:  Throughout the document,
no attempt is made to define  &quot;discrimination&quot; or to
limit in any way its application to only those characteristics
of persons  rightly regarded as &quot;neutral&quot;   ethnicity,
national origin, creed, gender, disability, etc.  It may be  better
to leave this term undefined, on the presumption that prevailing
national policies, which  generally protect only neutral characteristics,
are what is meant.  Nonetheless, the recent action in the European
Parliament to protect homosexual partnerships, and US initiatives
to expand &quot;domestic partnership&quot; legislation offer some
argument for defining &quot;discrimination&quot; here to mean
only the protection of neutral characteristics.  Possible language:
 &quot;Eliminating de jure  discrimination, while [ developing]
encouraging educational programmes and media campaigns  aimed
at eliminating de facto discrimination against persons based on
race, sex, national  origin, religion, political affiliation,
disability, or other characteristics unrelated to character or
performance.    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph d:  [reflect better]  better
reflects    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph f:  &quot;Making political
and social processes inclusive of all  lawabiding members of society
...&quot;  Many nationstates exclude criminals from access to
certain political and social processes.  The phrase as written,
like much of the declaration, is  susceptible of widely varying
interpretation, but as written it appears open to abuse.  The
best course of action may be to delete the phrase &quot;inclusive
of all members of society and&quot;, since &quot;respecting political
pluralism and cultural diversity&quot; sufficiently describes
an open political  system.    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 15, subparagraph c:  &quot;ensuring that all
obstacles to full equity and equality  between women and men are
removed in all private and public institutions of society.&quot;
 The  dangers in this language are obvious.  The United Nations
is hereby committing itself to eliminating anything it regards
as inequities between men and women in private institutions. 
If  churches and parachurch organizations are excepted from this
proscription, that fact is not  mentioned.  These issues have
created tremendous friction and debate in the United States and
 elsewhere in the developed world.  Most US &quot;equal rights&quot;
statutes have been limited in their  application to &quot;public
accommodations,&quot; a term which embraces many private institutions
that  hold themselves forward as open to the public, but excludes
those, such as churches and other  religiously affiliated institutions,
which impose membership requirements based on creed.  Most US
statutes, with one or two exceptions, also exempt private, nonpublicly
supported clubs and  associations (e.g., the Boy Scouts, the YMCA).
 This principle should be protected here.  &quot;Public accommodations&quot;
is not a term common to UN documents.  I recommend revision to
read &quot;all  [private and] public and publicly accessible institutions
of society&quot;.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 16, subparagraph a:  The language as written
suggests governmental  interference with the media to ensure socially
constructive attitudes.  The goal is laudable, but its implementation
by government is violative of free speech standards and guarantees.
 The purposes  of government in this regard are better served
by policies that encourage the development of a diverse body of
mass media.  Increasing the body of media voices, not stifling
an errant few, is a proper sphere for government action.  It is
akin to averting the growth of monopolies in the economic sphere.
 If language stating this objective cannot be obtained, change
&quot;Ensuring&quot; to  &quot;Encouraging&quot; to leave this
objective in the realm of the bully pulpit.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 16, subparagraph c:  &quot;including on gender,
family and cultural issues ...&quot;  The paragraph as written
is narrow and excludes needed improvements in data collection
on  issues of family structure and culture.  For example, international
data preliminarily examined by scholars at the American Enterprise
Institute suggests a close linkage between infant mortality and
 family structure.  Gender analysis is one of only many relevant
possible areas for improvement.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 17, subparagraph d:  &quot;... policies to
combat terrorism, organized crime,  sexual exploitation and drug
trafficking.&quot;  This additional language gives higher visibility
and  priority to efforts to combat the exploitation of minors
in South Asia and elsewhere around the  world where the international
sex and pornography trade are officially ignored or inadequately
 resisted.    
<P>
Page 22, paragraph 20:  The personal dimension of poverty is excluded
from this analysis of the  origins of poverty.  It is most easily
addressed by modifying the first sentence of the paragraph to
read &quot;and cultural and personal values.&quot;  Without more,
however, this entire section focuses too  heavily on &quot;political
and economic structures&quot; and too lightly on personality structures
such as  selfdiscipline, deferral of gratification, honesty and
hard work.  To address this problem, add  after &quot;those who
cannot support themselves&quot; the following: &quot;to foster
personal qualities of selfdiscipline, honesty, hard work, and
the deferral of gratification;&quot;    
<P>
Page 24, paragraph 26, subparagraph a:  The most important indicator
of poverty is family  structure.  This indicator must be added
to the litany of poverty and vulnerability indicators.    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 29, subparagraph a:  Language should be added
to the phrase &quot;redistributing  land&quot; to bar expropriation
and confiscation of lawfully owned and managed property.  The
US  Constitution includes a &quot;takings clause,&quot; which
obliges government to compensate owners for  lawfully expropriated
or attached property.  Even in developed countries, this principle
is  irregularly and inadequately followed.  This paragraph should
read:  &quot;encouraging the  redistribution of [redistributing]
land where necessary to foster a return to productive use  and
where full compensation and other due process of law is guaranteed
to lawful owners.&quot;    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 30, subparagraph a:  &quot;access of people
living in poverty to responsible levels  of credit ...&quot; 
The United Nations should not require any lending institution
to make irresponsible  loans.  In fact, the declaration's clear
and repeated call for debt restructuring and forgiveness for 
developing nations dramatizes the fact that irresponsible lending
that ignores economic viability damages both the lending institution
and the dependent party.  This experience must be applied to micro
as well as macroeconomics.    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 30, subparagraph c:  &quot;Providing incentives
for [, earmarking percentages of  the lending base].  In line
with the criticism noted above, lending institutions must retain,
for the sake of their depositors as well as the wellbeing of borrowers,
reasonable standards of viability and repayability for all loans
in their portfolio.  Encouraging lenders to provide responsible
levels  of credit to impoverished persons for socially valuable
purposes is a laudable aim, but setasides  and quotas can only
encourage distortions in the loan market and the placement of
irresponsible  loans.  This will not alleviate poverty and may,
in fact, hinder normal patterns of development.    
<P>
Page 27, paragraph 32, subparagraph b:  The phrase &quot;full
and equal access&quot; to health services  suggests that the same
standards of service that apply to women should apply to girls.
 The  implication is that services to be provided are identical
irrespective of maturity, marital status, or other factors.  Add
at the end of this sentence, &quot;with due regard for the responsibility
of  government to protect the vulnerability of the immature and
the sanctuary of the family.&quot;    
<P>
Page 28, paragraph 33, add a new subparagraph i, and adjust the
following subparagraph accordangle:  &quot;Encouraging the formation
and retention of stable family units, as a shield against poverty,
the appropriate locus for sexual expression, childbearing and
childrearing, and the essential factor in successful education
and the creation of productive and responsible  citizens.&quot;
<P>
Page 28, paragraph 34, subparagraph c:  The antagonism, in some
nations, between formal and  nonformal education for preschoolers
should be acknowledged.  To some extent, these objectives can
be mutually exclusive.  Numerous education experts believe that
nonformal education  within the family is significantly healthier
and more effective than early formal education before a child
is emotionally or psychologically ready to learn.  The best way
to address this concern is to add the word voluntary before &quot;preschool
education&quot; to assure that mandates do not drive out parental
education of young children in the home. 
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 34, subparagraph d:  Same changes as recommended
for Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph b.    
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 34, subparagraph e:  Removing objectionable
language in this context may  prove impossible.  I recommend instead
that language be added to encourage the provision of  health care
to expectant mothers and the children they carry that will enable
them to carry those  children successfully to term.  &quot;Safe
motherhood&quot; must be made to be synonymous with safety for
 both mother and child  this is logical because, without the child,
it is not motherhood at all. The strategy of proabortion organizations
at Cairo was to move away from an individual conception  of maternal
health that focuses on the health of every motherandchild in utero
toward a collective, public healthoriented concept that denies
the need to protect the health of mother and child in all circumstances.
 This is one occasion where the faulty language in the declaration
can be improved by making it truly universal, i.e., protective
of all mothers and children.  Amend this language to read &quot;full
access to such services, including voluntary and informed reproductive
health/family planning care for married couples [and], education
on safe motherhood, and  supportive services for all expectant
mothers and the children they carry, [and prenatal and postnatal
care] both prenatally and postnatally.    
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 35, subparagraph e.  &quot;Expanding and strengthening
social insurance   programmes and tax policies to protect working
people ...&quot;  Burdensome taxation can subject  working families
to poverty.  Recently the United States reformed a program called
the Earned  Income Tax Credit to provide additional income to
lift working families above the poverty line.   Broadly considered,
this is a &quot;social insurance&quot; programme, but the key
is that it is based on an  alleviation of taxation on the working
family, not the direct imposition of a tax on families or  other
entities.   
<P>
Page 30, paragraph 36, subparagraph d:  &quot;Improving the status
of the single parent in society&quot; is  opposed to policies
that responsibly discourage the deliberate choice of single parenthood
or  sexual irresponsibility.  Assisting single parents to care
for their child is generally sound policy,  but even here society
gains nothing by refusing to recognize that promotion of adoption
is the  better alternative for many single mothers.  To avoid
these notional difficulties, amend this  subparagraph to read:
[&quot;Improving the status of the single parent in society and]
Ensuring that  singleparent families receive the social support
they need, include support for adequate housing and the child
care of their choice, with special emphasis on incentives for
marriage and  strengthening extended family networks.&quot;  
<P>
Page 32, paragraph 43, bullet one:  The &quot;full participation
of employers and trade unions&quot;  excludes the vast majority
of the world's workers.  Add &quot;nonunionized workers&quot;
to this phrase.    
<P>
Page 34, paragraph 46, add a subparagraph g:  &quot;Establishing
policies to encourage invention and entrepreneurship, to protect
the products of invention and entrepreneurship from  misappropriation,
and to provide inventors and entrepreneurs with access to capital
and  economic rewards sufficient to encourage the development
and introduction of new technologies and methods.&quot;  Much
technological development takes place outside &quot;national and
local technology institutions; indeed, the home computer revolution
was largely sparked by the  technical wizardry of two Americans
working out of a garage.  Assurance of economic rewards,  protection
of copyrights and patents, and access to capital are as or more
critical than support for technology institutions as a means to
promote employmentintensive growth.  Experience demonstrates that
governments cannot always predict, produce, or judge which technologies
will have the most profound impact in promoting economic growth
and human betterment.    
<P>
Page 34, paragraph 47, subparagraph d:  Revise to read &quot;increasing
family benefits and social  support such as equitable and substantial
financial support for all forms of child care, including care
at home.       
<P>
Page 38, paragraph 55, subparagraph d.  This paragraph is a glaring
demonstration of the  irreconcilability of the declaration's claimed
dedication to sovereignty and its clear commitment to utilize
United Nations instrumentalities to change attitudes toward the
division of paid labor and housework!  Many families around the
world obviously do not wish their attitudes to be changed.  They
believe explicitly in the social and childrearing advantages of
a single wageearner  structure.  They have no wish to impose those
structure on all peoples and families around the globe.  They
adopt such patterns as sequencing in which a primary caregiver,
usually the mother, leaves the paid labor force to devote herself
fulltime to the care of her family, only to return to paid labor
as the children enter formal schooling or are fully grown.  That
the United Nations would seek to use its resources to foster the
destruction of such patterns is reprehensible, but it will also
ultimately be futile.  This language is a retreaded version of
the most doctrinaire  feminism that is losing popularity even
in the most advanced nations.  If language of any kind is  needed,
it should state only &quot;Devising public policies that support
maximum family choice and empowerment over questions of parental
division of labor.&quot;  The reference to &quot;child care  facilities&quot;
appears to favor the least popular form of child care in the United
States, i.e.,  institutional child care.  This phrase should be
modified to read, as above, support for all forms  of child care,
including home care and family care.  The phrase profamily tax
relief should  also be added to this litany of workfamily policies,
as this issue transcends all the others in  promoting family freedom.
 Other objections could be raised to this paragraph, but these
are the  major ones.    
<P>
Page 38, paragraph 55, subparagraph e.  On the scale of public
values, encouraging fathers and  mothers to stay together is far
more important than using atomic scales to measure gender  equality
in diaperchanging and other domestic duties.  Nearly all studies
of child care issues point out that most parents would prefer
to have one or both working parents spend more time with their
children, if loss of income were not an issue.  The point is that
all of these subparagraphs ignore parental choice and parental
preferences and subordinate them to the goal of encouraging women
to take paid employment.  Other than ideology, it is not clear
why this should be so.  This  paragraph should be replaced with
one that reads:  Encouraging governments to recognize the unique
contributions of families with children and to adopt policies
that maximize parental time spent in childrearing activities and
minimize the need for families to spend inordinate time in paid
labor activities at the expense of overall family wellbeing. 
The goal here is to encourage at least some form of a family wage
system that leaves each parent's role as the parents mutually
agree.  Parttime, flexible, and home working schedules promote
this result, as well.    
<P>
Page 41, paragraph 64, add to the last bullet item listed:  &quot;violence,
crime, drug abuse and  trafficking, sexual exploitation, and other
behaviors that diminish productivity, shorten lifespan and spread
disease.  This language is needed to assure that &quot;respect
for diversity&quot; does not  include respect for actions that
involve a dimension of personal immorality.  &quot;Diversity&quot;
properly means neutral differences, not moral disputes about issues
of character.    
<P>
Page 41, paragraph 66, subparagraph c:  Revise to read &quot;Giving
community organizations,  private associations and natural institutions
like the family greater control . . .&quot;                  
<P>
Page 42, paragraph 67, subparagraph a:  The phrase &quot;as appropriate&quot;
may suffice to address  concern about the overextension of prohibitions
on discrimination to distinctly moral categories. Marriage laws
currently &quot;discriminate&quot; against samegender pairs. 
Enacting legislation to  reverse this situation would be inappropriate,
but it may be wiser to nail this down with some  effort to define
unacceptable discrimination.  Note the language at page 40, paragraph
59 that  comes close to defining the scope of acceptable prohibitions
on discrimination:  &quot;different groups which are defined by
language, ethnicity, religion, geography or class.&quot;  This
internal definition  may offer a route to an acceptably limited
definition of discrimination, with the addition of gender and
disability.    
<P>
Page 42, paragraph 67, subparagraph b:  [removal of reservations],
for the reasons noted above.    
<P>
Page 45, paragraph 71, subparagraph a:  In many places in the
declaration, the emphasis on the  elimination of violence against
certain groups in society (armed conflict, for example) is culturally
true and entirely appropriate.  Here it is mystifying.  Young
males are disproportionately the victims of homicide (at the hands
of other young males, in most cases) in developed countries, including
the United States.  On the general issue of social violence, thereis
absolutely no need for gender oneupmanship.  The United Nations
should never jettison concern for violence against young men,
who are among the most pathetic victims of family breakup in advanced
societies.  I recommend ending the first sentence of this paragraph
as follows, &quot;with particular attention to vulnerable persons
who are the most frequent victims of violent acts.&quot;  Crime
and violence are pervasive enough that they should never be turned
into mere group politics.    
<P>
Page 47.  Nearly every word on this page illustrates the tension
in this document between its  repeated pledges to respect and
promote &quot;decentralization,&quot; government &quot;closest
to the people,&quot;  &quot;national sovereignty,&quot; &quot;small
business entrepreneurs&quot; and &quot;grassroots/community organizations.&quot;
   As national strategies are here designed, &quot;priorities
and time frames&quot; are the responsibility of national governments.
 &quot;Massive political will to invest in people&quot; is required
to achieve these goals.  All of this is &quot;primarily the responsibility
of national Governments.&quot;  The declaration does not strive
to reconcile these contradictory themes and objectives.  In small
nationstates, national Governments may in fact be close to the
people.  In large nations, they are remote, and the general direction
of policy reform is running counter to central government solutions.
 The declaration's only attempt to resolve this problem is to
include language at various points that expresses all points of
view.  The irony of the United nations amassing resources and
summoning political will to promote local solutions ought not
to miss anyone's attention.  There are far too many problems with
this page to fix it, but it is probably the clearest expression
yet of the authors' actual intent in devising the programme of
action.    
<P>
Page 48, paragraph 75, prologue:  Include family counseling and
assistance among the spheres  of work done by NGOs.          
<P>
Page 49, paragraph 76, subparagraph f:  This paragraph includes
the first reference in the  document to &quot;debate&quot; about
the direction of social policy.  The rest of the declaration could
be  improved by correcting this omission and recognizing that
the most progressive nations are those that have the most debate
about all of the issues covered by the document.    
<P>
Page 50, paragraph 77, subparagraph a:  add nonpunitive before
&quot;taxes&quot;; add at the end or that  provide incentives
for selfdefeating and selfdestructive behaviors.    
<P>
Page 52, paragraph 82.  This paragraph broaches the possibility
of vesting the United Nations  with taxing authority.  This idea
is only surfaced here, but its philosophical implications are
 profound.  It raises the possibility that the United Nations
Economic and Social Council will take on the characteristics of
an extralateral, rather than multilateral institution.  Such a
mechanism  would inevitably diminish individual nations' role
in managing and overseeing the development of  United Nations
policy.  This paragraph deserves wide publicity and debate now.
 Similar concerns are raised by the references to international
taxation and involuntary financing of the United  Nations at paragraphs
85 b and 86 g.

<p>
The Clinton Administration's women-in-combat policy has created
an atmosphere which may make it difficult for officers to comply
with combat-related military service.  The recent case of Navy
helicopter pilot Lieutenant Commander Ken Carkhuff illustrates
the unfortunate turn that the pursuit of a gender-blind military
may be taking for the US Navy and for those who object to the
policy. 
<P>
On August 24, 1994, Carkhuff told his executive officer, &quot;I
cannot take this detachment to sea.&quot;  The detachment included
two female pilots, and Carkhuff later explained, &quot;I could
not appear to endorse a policy [the women-in-combat policy] that
I didn't agree with.&quot; Carkhuff's statement disqualified him
from leading his detachment. His commander relieved him of his
duties and two officer boards have concluded that Carkhuff should
be honorably discharged from the service.[1]
<P>
Carkhuff told the &quot;show cause&quot; board on May 18, 1995,
&quot;I think that we should not be subjecting... women to violence,
and there is no more extreme violence that a human can be involved
in than in combat.&quot;[2]  He said that he was not anxious to confront
the policy and stated that he had no objection to women serving
in the Navy.[3]
<P>
Carkhuff had, in fact, just completed a year at the Naval War
College where the issue of women in combat was debated extensively.
 He had strong and religiously-based views on this issue.  The
day he privately stated his view to his boss corresponded to the
birth of his fifth child, a daughter.  Carkhuff feared that leading
women into a possible combat situation [the US invasion of Haiti
was weeks away] would incrementally lead to expanded combat roles
for women and perhaps his own daughter's forced combat role in
the future.
<P>
Commander Carkhuff did state at the hearing that &quot;if ordered
to execute that policy, I will do it.&quot;[4]  Nevertheless, the
Navy stood by its decision to discharge him honorably.
<P>
This case raises questions about a double standard at work in
the Navy on the issue of voicing personal opinions about women
in combat.  In 1992, uniformed female Navy officers gathered on
Capitol Hill to lobby against the female combat 
ban, labeling it an &quot;equal opportunity issue.&quot;  The
Navy ignored regulations which restrict uniformed sailors from
personal lobbying and did not discipline these officers.  However,
Carkhuff's private protest resulted in an honorable discharge.
 This would demonstrate that violations committed while protesting
in support of women in combat are ignored, while those protests
against the policy of women in combat are punished.
<P>
More importantly, this case raises questions about whether the
Navy is in danger of losing good men due to its women-in-combat
policy.  Carkhuff was a proven officer with consistently high
performance ratings.  Assuming there are other exemplary men who,
because of such policies, will cut short their military careers,
the military does not profit.  Nor does it profit from the fact
that this policy may discourage some would-be &quot;top guns&quot;
from responding to recruitment appeals to pursue a military career.
<P>
The Clinton Administration has erased more than 250,000 combat
exemptions for women.  Today, women can be assigned to 95 percent
of all Navy billets.  Feminists say this is progress, but combat
veterans and our combat-hardened allies know this portends disaster.
 In fact, the Navy's policy of women in combat is contrary to
the findings of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment
of Women in the Armed Forces.
<P>
The board reviewing Carkhuff did not find that Carkhuff lacked
the ability to perform.  According to Navy documents, he is being
honorably separated for disagreeing with a politically sensitive
policy, and for refusing to perform a duty.
<P>
When officers so strongly protest, it is time for the Pentagon
and Congress to reconsider the wisdom of policies that increase
the combat role of women.  Men like Carkhuff deserve the opportunity
to honorably serve, rather than have their careers cut short by
an unfortunate and dangerous policy.

<title>MARRIAGE PROTECTS WOMEN FROM VIOLENCE</title>

<h2>MARRIAGE PROTECTS WOMEN<br>
FROM VIOLENCE</h2>

<p>
Studies and pronouncements about violence against women continue
to make headlines.  Recently, the Justice Department announced
that a redesigned national survey found that violence against
women is much higher than previously reported.  The survey also
reveals that marriage often shields women from violence.  
<P>
Any violence against women should be strongly condemned, and offenders
should be punished to the full extent of the law.   But some feminists
exaggerate the real scope of this tragic problem using unvetted
advocacy research.   Consider some advocacy reporting:
<UL>
<LI>&quot;There are three to four million women beaten by husbands
or lovers every year; that's one every 15 seconds.&quot;  (<I>Chicago
Tribune</I>, February 10, 1992)
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Four million to six million women are beaten [each year].
 That means once every five seconds...a woman is punched or kicked...or
held down and pummeled.&quot;  (Associated Press)[1]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Miami talk-show host Pat Stevens told a <I>Crossfire</I> audience
that 60 million women are abused every year.[2]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Ms</I>. magazine's &quot;Campus Project on Sexual Assault&quot;
claims that 15.4 percent of college women are raped and 12.1 percent
experience an attempted rape each year.[3]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>When President Clinton named Bonnie Campbell to head the &quot;Violence
Against Women&quot; office at the Justice Department, he said
there are 700,000 rapes or attempted rapes every year.[4]
</UL>
<P>
<P>
The bases for these &quot;facts&quot; are seldom given and they
should be suspect.  After all, there are 31,536,000 seconds in
a year.  If an American woman is victimized every 15 seconds,
then there are in reality 2,124,000 incidents.  Five million violent
female victimizations would be one every 6.3 seconds.
<P>
The August, 1995 Bureau of Justice Statistics study, &quot;Violence
Against Women: Estimates from the Redesigned Survey,&quot; provides
a different, although, sobering picture.[5]
Men are far more likely to be victims of crime (64.9 v. 43.7 per
1,000 persons) than women.[6]   But women are nine times more likely
than men to become rape/sexual assault victims.[7]   That figure
is higher than previously reported.
<P>
The new survey estimates there are 500,200 female victimizations
each year which includes 172,400 completed rapes and 141,200 attempted
rapes.[8]  In comparison, the FBI previously reported 109,062 forcible
rapes for 1992, which was a 38.2 percent rise in the total number
of reported rapes and a 27 percent rate increase since 1973.[9]
<P>
The study is based on the redesigned National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS) which is a continuous nationally representative
sample of 50,000 households.  The latest report includes the years
1992-1993 and with revised questions it found that the average
annual rate of violent victimization per 1,000 women rose from
5.4 in 1987-91 to 9.4.[10]
<P>
The woman's relationship to the offender is a key variable.  The
1995 study found that a woman is three times more likely to be
raped or sexually assaulted by a boyfriend and 10 times more likely
to be raped or sexually assaulted by an acquaintance thanby a
spouse.  Single women are just as likely to be raped or sexually
assaulted by a stranger as they are by a boyfriend.[11]
<P>
When all acts of violence against women are considered, married
or widowed women are 30 times less likely than separated women
to become violence victims.  Married women are at least four times
less likely than never-married women to be crime victims.[12]
<P>
The study also found that women aged 19-29 are the most likely
violence victims.  They are twice as likely to become victims
as 30 to 45 year old women and 12 to 18 year old girls.[13]  Although
the Justice Department report does not explain the difference,
U.S. Census Bureau statistics show that the older female cohort
tends to be married and the younger cohort is more likely to live
in homes where there is a protecting father.[14]
<P>
Family income also makes a big difference.  Women from middle
income families tend to be four times safer than those from families
with incomes under $10,000.  Education, ethnicity and race are
not major violence discriminators.[15]
<P>
<center><h3>CONCLUSIONS ABOUT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN</h3></center>
<P>
Incidents of rape and sexual assault are officially higher than
previously reported but do not come close to the figures offered
by some advocacy researchers.  Based on the new survey it's too
early to determine whether violence against women is rising. 
But it's clear that the offender/victim relationship is key and
deserves more attention.
<P>
Young women (19-29 years old), who have never married (or are
separated) and have low incomes are most vulnerable to violence.
 Their offenders are more likely to be known to them, and crime
by non-strangers usually occurs at or near the woman's home. 
<P>
The survey shows that marriage protects all female cohorts from
every type of violence.  Married women are safer than single,
separated, divorced and never-married women.    
<P>
Marriage also reduces violent crime incidents among men.  It helps
to channel male aggression toward positive goals.  Never-married
men are more likely to commit assault and they suffer most (58.9
percent) assaults.[16]  They are also five times more likely to rape
and commit other violent crime than married men.[17]
<P>
The Justice Department's latest report should encourage government
to harness marriage as a shield against violence.  The report
also tells American women and girls that the safest place today
is living in homes with their husbands and fathers.

<h2>THE STRAIGHT STORY<br>
ON NEW JERSEY:<br>
BIRTHS, ABORTIONS, AND THE FAMILY CAP</h2>

<p>
In August of 1993, the first &quot;family cap&quot; in the nation
took effect in the state of New Jersey as part of a larger package
of reforms known as the Family Development Program.  The family
cap provision stipulates that a mother who has already received
welfare benefits for at least 10 months and who bears an additional
child will receive no increase in her basic monthly AFDC benefit.
 The provision affects only the monthly <I>cash</I> benefit, however.
 Health benefits and food stamps continue to increase with family
size.
<P>
The raw numbers of births and abortions in New Jersey since the
cap took effect strongly suggest that the policy has reduced the
number of births to AFDC mothers without affecting the abortion
rate.
<P>
Raw data for the 20-month period from August 1992 to March 1994
appears in Table 1:

<P>
The total number of abortions in the year before the policy took
effect was 11,817, yielding a monthly average of 984.75.  In the
eight months after the policy took effect (including March 1994,
which had a far higher total of abortions than any other month
on record), the total number of abortions was 7,932, yielding
a monthly average of 991.5.  The difference (0.7%) is trivial
and well within the expected range of random fluctuation.  If
the anomalous month of March were excluded from the analysis,
the average would be just 953 abortions per month after the introduction
of the family cap -- a 3% decline from the previous year's average,
but also trivial enough to be within the range of random fluctuation.
<P>
A more comprehensive look at the data reduces the significance
of the difference even further.  The average monthly caseload
in the year before the family cap was enacted was 121,479.  In
the eight months post-cap, the average monthly caseload was 122,679
-- a difference of less than 1%.  But the monthly abortion rate
(number of abortions per 1,000 AFDC cases) was 8.11 in the year
prior to enactment of the family cap and only 8.08 in the eight
months post-enactment.  The difference is too small to be statistically
significant, but it is worth noting that the total number of abortions
in the period after implementation of the cap was three <I>fewer</I>
than predicted by the rate before enactment of the policy.
<P>
Using the entire preceding year as the baseline, however, tends
to distort the real effect of the family cap because the abortion
rate was very low in the period ranging from August to November
1992.  During the eight months immediately preceding the introduction
of the cap (December 1992 to July 1993), New Jersey welfare mothers
underwent 8,144 abortions -- 212 <I>more</I> than in the eight
months after the cap took effect.  If the post-cap data did not
include the month of March 1994, moreover, the post-cap abortion
average would have been 8% less than the average for the previous
seven months.
<P>
No responsible statistician would therefore conclude that the
family cap must reduce abortions.  But an honest evaluation of
the available data strongly argues that, contrary to the fears
expressed by many in the pro-life community, the family cap has
had no impact on the number or rate of abortions among New Jersey's
AFDC recipients.  The monthly abortion totals fluctuated with
no apparent pattern, but were always within the expected range.
 The total number of abortions in the eight months post-cap was
almost exactly what would have been projected if there had been
no change in the state's welfare policy.
<P>
The birth rate among AFDC recipients, on the other hand, was significantly
lower after introduction of the family cap.  In the year prior
to the cap, the total number of births to welfare mothers in New
Jersey was 15,972, yielding a monthly average of 1,331 births
and a monthly rate of 10.96 births per thousand AFDC recipients.
 In the eight months post-cap, there were 9,519 births, yielding
a monthly average of 1,190 births and a monthly rate of 9.70 births
per thousand AFDC recipients.  The difference is consistent, substantial,
and statistically significant.
<P>
In all eight months after the introduction of the cap, the birth
totals were below the previous year's average and lower than the
total for the corresponding month in the previous year.  The monthly
abortion totals after implementation of the cap show a more random
pattern.  In six of the eight months, there were fewer abortions
than the previous year's average, but in only three of those months
was the abortion total lower than the total for the corresponding
month the year before.
<P>
When the entire 20-month period is divided into 4-month increments
(see Table 2), the change in the average number of births is obvious.
 The family cap has produced a significant reduction in the number
of births and pregnancies, but has had no discernible impact on
the number of abortions.

<P>
<P>
The only way to calculate a higher abortion rate for the post-cap
period is to suppress the data from April to July 1993 -- the
period immediately prior to implementation of the new policy --
and compare the abortion totals from the post-cap period with
the totals from the corresponding months of the previous year.
 <I>Unless the April to July 1993 data is suppressed, </I>the
abortion rate after implementation of the family cap appears to
be either the same as or lower than the abortion rate before the
cap.
<P>
There are only two hypotheses that could justify suppressing the
April to July 1993 data and preserve the finding that the abortion
rate has increased since implementation of the cap.
<P>
First, it is possible that the abortion rate follows an annual
cyclical pattern and that the monthly abortion totals from April
to July 1994 will show the same inflation as in 1993.  But a close
examination of the month-by-month totals suggests that the high
months and low months in the two years do not correspond with
enough consistency to indicate a seasonal cycle.  In 1992-1993,
the months with high abortion totals were October, January, and
March, while August, November, and December registered low totals.
 In 1993-1994, August and March were the months with a high number
of abortions, and the September total was relatively low.
<P>
The second hypothesis is that welfare mothers may have staged
an &quot;abortion rush&quot; prior to implementation of the family
cap, thereby generating unusually high abortion totals in the
months immediately preceding the change in policy.  But the single
month in which an &quot;abortion rush&quot; would have been most
visible, July 1993, had a lower abortion total than either June
1993 or August 1993.  The number of abortions declined between
June and July and increased between July and August.  The time
period with the highest number of abortions spanned six months,
from March to August -- straddling the enactment date -- and then
was followed by six months of low abortion totals after implementation
of the family cap.
<P>
While it is still premature to draw any decisive conclusions from
the welfare reform experiment in New Jersey, it is becoming increasingly
fantastic to claim that the state has experienced an upsurge in
abortions since the family cap took effect.  The reported &quot;increase&quot;
in abortions rests on a statistical illusion created by suppressing
data from the four-month period immediately preceding the policy
change -- which includes the highest abortion totals recorded
in the data under study.
<P>
Those who would hold welfare reform hostage in the name of saving
lives bear a significant burden of proof in maintaining that more
lives will be saved by preserving the current welfare system.
 The consistent, strong correlation between increased welfare
spending and increased abortions should be far more troublesome
data to pro-lifers than the most recent numbers from New Jersey.

<title>RENEWING THE AMERICAN DREAM FOR EDUCATION</title>

<h2>RENEWING THE AMERICAN DREAM<br>
FOR EDUCATION</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<i>Jennifer A. Marshall</i></center>
<p>
High-profile advocates of public education lack an inspiring vision
for the educational renewal of America.  President Bill Clinton,
Secretary of Education Richard Riley, Congress, teacher union
bosses -- all alternately cheerlead and criticize, but their discussions
usually degenerate into bickering over funding, equity, and the
competitiveness of the American economy.  Ultimately, they are
concerned about the educational <I>system</I> and its place in
the larger context of American society and the national economy.
Little of what they have to say deals with the real stuff of
education.
<p>
Dorothy Sayers, an author and a contemporary of C.S. Lewis, articulated
half a century ago the foolishness of focusing on the system and
thereby missing the whole aim of education:
<p><blockquote>
What use is it to pile task on task and prolong the days of labor,
if at the close the chief object is left unattained?  It is not
the fault of the teachers -- they work only too hard already.
 The combined folly of a civilization that has forgotten its own
roots is forcing them to shore up the tottering weight of an educational
structure that is built upon sand....  For the sole true end of
education is simply this:  to teach men how to learn for themselves;
and whatever instruction fails to do this is effort spent in vain.[1]
</blockquote><p>
Sayers clearly had a vision of what education ought to be.
<p>
Today, once again, those with the academic zeal that rallies others
to renew education have a vision that goes beyond the realities
of the public school system.  Their common sense, optimistic ideas
are not constrained by the inadequacies of a federally run education
bureaucracy.  As Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville remarked in 1835,
such freedom from bureaucracy is -- or at least once was -- distinctively
American:  &quot;Uniformity or permanence of design, the minute
arrangement of details, and the perfection of administrative system
must not be sought for in the United States; what we find there
is the presence of a power which, if it is somewhat wild, is at
least robust....&quot;[2] Homeschooling and classical education
exemplify this genius and vibrancy of the American people.
<p>
<center><h3>SCHOOLING BY THE TRUE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</h3></center>
<p>
We have long known that the &quot;true department of education,&quot;
as author Douglas Wilson refers to the family, is the institution
behind the success of the homeschool movement.[3] Recent scholarship,
however, shows the role of the family in the academic success
of children in all settings. Because parents are vested with the
authority and responsibility to oversee their children's upbringing,
especially their education, homeschooling ought not to be considered
the method of last resort, but a first option.  Recent scholarship
demonstrates that, no matter what the school setting, family is
the key factor in the academic success of children.[4]
<p>
Critics may view homeschoolers as somewhat reclusive, but the
flourishing movement contributes to society much more than they
recognize.  Increased interaction within the family counters the
individualism and the &quot;generation gaps&quot; created by the
secular culture.  With some 400,000 families currently homeschooling,
the movement has also become a gathering point for inter-family
relations.  Networks and support groups abound (see the addendum
for a sample listing).  Though the homeschooling movement takes
a back-to-basics approach to academics, it is thoroughly progressive
when it comes to using the latest technology.  CompuServe and
America Online forums provide helpful hints on raising kids, curriculum
tips, homework help, and an ongoing discussion of a new ideal
for education.
<p>
Homeschoolers are some of the most politically involved private
citizens in America.  Politicians have learned not to trifle with
the &quot;stay-at-home mom&quot; with a phone tree, a fax machine,
and a firm devotion to raising well-grounded children.  Initially
a measure for self-defense, homeschoolers' lobbying efforts have
strengthened the platform for all families in America.   Nationwide
homeschool networks have proven to be very effective avenues of
communication.  The Home School Legal Defense Association, located
outside of Washington, D.C., disseminates regular alerts calling
homeschoolers to action when threats to their -- and everyone's
-- freedom arise.
<p>
Bill and Mary Pride and their nine children are the epitome of
a fully engaged homeschooling family.  Ranging from toddlers to
teens, the kids are all taught at home and always have been. 
The Pride children's educational package takes advantage of everything
from traditional material to on-line computer classes.  To share
their good news in education, the Prides publish a quarterly magazine
called <i>Practical Homeschooling</i> with 96 pages of suggestions
for networking, critiques of curriculum and software, discussions
of educational theories and lighthearted openness about the joys
and trials of the homeschooling life.  Mary does much of the writing
herself and also gathers articles from some of the most staunchly
conservative education thinkers in the nation, including Samuel
Blumenfeld and Doug Wilson.  <I>Practical Homeschooling</I> now
has an on-line site of its own which includes forums for Q &amp;
A on homeschooling pragmatics and on-line chats with contributing
authors.
<p>
<center><h3>THE RETURN OF CLASSICAL EDUCATION</h3></center>
<p>
Truly a timeless educational philosophy, classical education has
now hit cyberspace and become the subject of much chatting in
homeschool online forums.  The resurgence of this medieval model
of education is due in large part to Douglas Wilson, author of
<I>Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning.</I>  His title refers
to the essay which inspired his efforts, entitled, &quot;The Lost
Tools of Learning,&quot; by Dorothy Sayers.  Miss Sayers' 1947
critique of education stall efforts in an apt commentary on America's
system of public education in the '90s:
<p><blockquote>
We dole out lip-service to the importance of education -- lip-service
and, just occasionally, a little grant of money; we postpone the
school-leaving age, and plan to build bigger and better schools;
the teachers slave conscientiously in and out of school hours;
and yet, as I believe, all this devoted effort is largely frustrated,
because we have lost the tools of learning, and in their absence
can only make a botched and piecemeal job of it.[5]
</blockquote><p>
What she goes on to describe as &quot;the lost tools of learning&quot;
are the disciplines of Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric.  These are
the tools with which students must be equipped, she argues, in
order to tackle the content of any subject.  Sayers considers
Latin an important learning tool as well.  As the key to so many
languages, to the vocabulary of science, and to historical documents,
she estimates that in most subject areas, a knowledge of Latin
would cut learning time by half.  The study of Latin, and not
the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of the test, may prove to be the
surest way to recoup lost ground on the verbal section of the
SAT.
<p>
The contemporary relevance of Miss Sayers' insights is astonishing.
 While federal bureaucrats set a National Education Goal that
all our children will start school ready to learn, Sayers points
out that children are by nature sponges ready to absorb information.
 For those who disparage memorization and the accumulation of
factual knowledge, she points out that young children love litanies
of information.  She gives a whole new meaning to age appropriateness,
a topic of great discussion in the teaching colleges, by tying
Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric to a child's stages of mental development.
 And how about Latin, as Sayers suggests, for early childhood
education?  &quot;The Lost Tools of Learning&quot; ought to be
required reading in every teacher education class; it cuts through
the confusion and inconsistencies of modern educational theory.
 Sayers' vision is idealistic yet practical; it has the power
to inspire and the wisdom to work.
<p>
Doug Wilson has demonstrated that effectiveness.  Fourteen years
ago he founded Logos School, a distinctively Christian school
based on the Sayers' model of classical education.  Today there
are some thirty member schools in his Association of Classical
and Christian Schools (ACCS).   &quot;These schools are engaged
in what might be one of the most important educational reforms
of our time,&quot; writes Dr. Gene Veith, Dean of Arts and Sciences
at Concordia University.[6] Dr. Veith is in the midst of a year-long
study of classical education.  While modern education disintegrates,
notes Dr. Veith, these classical schools are &quot;recovering
the very approach to education that gave birth to Western civilization
and has continually brought that civilization to renewal.&quot;
 The re-popularization of classical education is timely indeed.
<p>
<center><h3>THE GREAT BOOKS</h3></center>
<p>
While equipping students with grammar, logic, and rhetoric, classical
education focuses on the great literary works of Western civilization,
something modern schools do less and less as contemporary books
replace the old.  The neglect of great books in the schools is
a symptom of a wider cultural trend, as evidenced by the disappearance
of classics from many libraries across the nation.  The Family
Research Council study, &quot;Discarded Images:  Selected Classics
and American Libraries,&quot; by Charles Donovan and William Spont,
documents this phenomenon.
<p>
Large tomes of collected works with ancient bindings may intimidate
the modern reader, but C.S. Lewis argues that old books are not
merely for the expert, but especially for the ordinary reader:
<p><blockquote>
[I]f the average student wants to find out something about Platonism,
the very last thing he thinks of doing is to take a translation
of Plato off the library shelf and read the <I>Symposium</I>.
 He would rather read some dreary modern book ten times as long,
all about 'isms' and influences and only once in twelve pages
telling him what Plato actually said....  But if he only knew,
the great man, just because of his greatness, is much more intelligible
than this modern commentator....  It has always therefore been
one of my main endeavours as a teacher to persuade the young that
first-hand knowledge is not only more worth acquiring than second-hand
knowledge, but is usually much easier and more delightful to acquire.[7]
</blockquote><p>
In contrast, Lewis advises the ordinary reader to take up the
old books &quot;precisely because he is an amateur and therefore
much less protected than the expert against the dangers of an
exclusive contemporary diet.  A new book is still on its trial
and the amateur is not in a position to judge it.&quot;[8] Classical
education has taken the precaution of going back to the revered
classics.
<p>
<center><h3>NEW CONCLUSIONS FROM OLD PRINCIPLES</h3></center>
<p>
While homeschool and classical education may be perceived as eccentric,
esoteric, and even impractical because of their intense pursuit
of &quot;intellectualism,&quot; they are actually thoroughly pragmatic.
 Both models guide students through the learning process efficiently
and deliberately.  The educational sequence is logical and meaningful.
 Meanwhile, we continue to fund a modern public school system
that measures hours spent in school (&quot;seat time&quot;), where
the curriculum is so disjointed that classroom teachers are hard
pressed to answer students' question, &quot;Why do we have to
learn this?&quot;  Convoluted attempts to standardize and individualize
simultaneously have resulted in a dysfunctional system.
<p>
The traditional methods espoused by homeschooling and classical
education strike just the balance the public school system lacks.
 They hold a universally high standard of excellence, and an inherent
standardization which comes from keeping educationally on-task.
 Yet the homeschool and classical models are also much more individualized
than the public school classroom, not only on the basis of size,
but also in personal attention to the development of each child's
mind.  While in the modern system the outcome is paramount, in
classical education and homeschooling the process is just as important
as the end.
<p>
Classical education and homeschooling recognize that different
students have varying strengths, and that each student should
be strengthened in all domains.  Where public education has gradually
excluded certain subjects (art, music, logic, etc.) from the core
curriculum and advised teachers to cater to all learning styles
in the remaining subjects, homeschool and classical education
have embraced the classical liberal arts which train students
in the whole spectrum of knowledge.  A student may excel in one
area and struggle in another, but he will grow in all.
<p>
Leaders of public education would do well to take cues from their
competitors.  Commitment to the system, however, continues to
prevent many from recognizing potentials for renewal. Consequently,
significant overhaul of the public school system may be the only
remedy.  As Doug Wilson notes, this is exactly what William Bennett,
former Secretary of Education, suggested after the Governors'
education summit in 1989, which initiated the America 2000/Goals
2000 agenda:
<p><blockquote>
I'd give the education reform movement another five years.  If
we're not able to get our schools back to where they were in 1963,
after spending 40 percent more, then maybe we should just declare
bankruptcy, give the people back their money, and let them start
their own schools.  That would be a radical way to have accountability.[9]
</blockquote><p>
Time's up.   The people have started their own schools and they
have already outdone the public school system.   We want our money
back.

<title>MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS</title>

<h2>MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS:<br>
GOOD FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM,<br>
GOOD FOR FAMILIES</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Catherine A. Deeds</i></center>
<p>
<center><h3>CURRENT HEALTH CARE SITUATION</h3></center>
<p>
Last year's historic health care debate proved -- to the surprise
of no one but the Clinton Administration -- that American families
will not tolerate federal bureaucrats or &quot;gatekeepers&quot;
in Washington dictating their medical services and choice of doctors.
  A government-run, &quot;one size <I>must </I>fit all&quot; health
policy violates Americans' fundamental principles of freedom.
<p>
An overwhelming majority (roughly 85 percent) of small businesses
provide health insurance for their employees but they should not
be <I>forced</I> to pay for them through a federal mandate, as
Clinton's plan would have required.  A government mandate costs
wages and jobs in the long run and is not the way to reform health
care or help the uninsured population. 
<p>
While employer-provided health benefits may address the problem
of health care &quot;access,&quot;  they do not address the problem
of rising health care costs, which everyone agrees needs to be
addressed.  The national debate on health care reform debunked
the &quot;Washington knows best&quot; philosophy in favor of innovative
state and free-market health care initiatives.  At the forefront
of free-market reform is the concept of medical savings accounts
(also known as MSAs, Medisave accounts, or Medical IRAs).  They
are the centerpiece of the Republicans' health care plan and have
proved popular with the 2,000 private companies that now have
them.  The basic premise is that MSAs empower consumers to make
their own decisions about spending on routine health care, choose
their own doctors, and save unspent account funds from year to
year to pay for future health or retirement needs.  By contrast,
the present &quot;third-party payer&quot; system offers no incentive
to spend wisely because someone else -- the government or private
insurance --  is paying the bill. 
<p>
This year, a bipartisan Congressional proposal to make MSAs tax
free (like traditional health insurance) has 130 cosponsors and
prospects for passage are good.  Congressional Republicans have
advocated MSAs as a potential cost-saving measure for Medicare
recipients as well.
<p>
<I>This year $1 trillion was spent on health care, accounting
for one-seventh of the nation's entire economy</I>.  As costs
rise, consumers pay higher premiums for their health insurance.
 For the most part, consumers are spending the money of a third
party -- the insurance company or government.  When this is the
case, common sense shows that consumers will not spend frugally
or wisely.  Why should they?   Former Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop likened the present third-party payer system to this:  The
government invites people to pick out a new car, charge it to
a card they issue, and then pays the bill.  The problem with this
system is that no one buys a Hyundai.  They all buy Cadillacs
and BMWs.
<p>
Our present health care system discourages competition and cost-consciousness
because, unlike car insurance, the consumer does not see the bill
or, for the most part, use his own money to pay for services.
 Therefore, there is no incentive to shop for lower-cost medical
care.  The administrative costs of processing insurance claims
for the majority of employers account for up to 35 percent of
total premium costs, and average 25 percent of premium costs for
the majority of employers.
<p>
This is the case because traditional indemnity/health insurance
plans tend to stipulate a low-deductible (out-of-pocket) amount
of $100-$250.  In other words, once the consumer has paid the
first $250 out of pocket for his family's medical care, the insurance
begins to pay.  That seems like a good deal but it is very expensive
in the long run because of high administrative costs and the lack
of cost-consciousness that the third-party payment system instills.
<p>
It would make better economic sense for businesses or individuals
to purchase a &quot;high-deductible&quot; health insurance plan
(which costs less in monthly premiums), combined with an MSA for
health care expenses below the deductible level.  (This type of
arrangement, however, does not enjoy equitable tax treatment under
current law.)  The Business Coalition for Affordable Health Care
estimates that approximately 10 percent of Americans spend <I>more
than</I> $2,000 per year on medical expenses.  A March/April 1994
<I>Journal of American Health Policy</I> study (using 1994 dollars)
of one million Americans showed that one-third of the population
filed no claims in 1989; 73 percent filed $500 or less in claims;
82 percent filed  $1,000 or less; and 89 percent filed $2,000
or less.  &quot;In other words, if this group had a $2,000 deductible
MSA, only 11 percent would have reached the deductible,&quot;
the editors noted.  An MSA empowers consumers to pay for routine
medical expenses from their account and to keep the unspent funds
for future health care needs, thus creating incentives for shopping
around and wise spending.  Medical expenditures from the MSAs
are applied against the deductible until the deductible (out-of-pocket
expense) is met, at which point the insurance coverage begins.
<p>
<center><h3>PRIVATE COMPANIES UTILIZE MSAs</h3></center>
<p>
Because of these positive features, more than 2,000 large and
small companies have begun offering MSAs to their employees, with
great success, even though current federal law does not exempt
contributions to such accounts.   Interestingly, seven states
have achieved tax fairness in their state income tax codes by
exempting contributions to MSAs.
<p>
A March 1995 Cato Institute study analyzed several companies and
states that provide MSAs, noting dramatic cost-savings and improvement
in customer satisfaction.  Consider these two examples:
<p><blockquote>
Dramatic savings from using MSAs have also been achieved at Windham
Hospital in Willimantic, Conn., with 1,000 employees.  In 1993
the hospital switched from a pure first-dollar coverage plan with
no deductible or co-payments to a plan with a $500 deductible.
 It also contributes $10 per week, or $520 per year, to an MSA
for each worker.  In addition, the hospital negotiated discounts
for its employees when they pay for health services with MSA funds.
 The hospital itself offers discounts of 30 percent, area doctors
offer price reductions of 20 percent, and drugstores cut prices
by 10 percent.
<p>
Under the old plan, the hospital's employees used medical services
35 percent more than the community average.  After one year under
the new plan, however, the entire 35 percent excess was eliminated.
 Moreover, projected health costs for the hospital employees were
reduced by about 50 percent.
<p></blockquote>
The study even cites the case of The United Mine Workers Union
that successfully negotiated for MSAs in their contract. 
<p><blockquote>
Under an agreement with the Bituminous Coal Operators Association,
covering about 15,000 employees, coal mine operators now provide
workers insurance with a $1,000 deductible replacing a zero deductible
under the old health plan.  The employees are each provided a
$1,000 cash bonus at the beginning of the year that they can use
for health care expenses below the deductible.  At the end of
the year, workers can keep for any use whatsoever any portion
of the bonus they do not use for health care.
<p></blockquote>
<center><h3>HELP FOR LOWER-INCOME FAMILIES</h3></center>
<p>
Companies that have MSAs have found they are most popular among
lower-income employees.  Under conventional insurance plans, low-income
employees would have to meet their $250 or $500 deductible with
after-tax dollars before they could access their insurance.  A
single mother earning $14,000 or $15,000 a year may find it difficult
to meet the deductible when rent, transportation, taxes, grocery
bills and other needs for her children are pressing.  An MSA allows
these low-income earners first dollar coverage, permitting them
to get medical care when they or their children need it.  This
feature alone could significantly reduce the level of emergency
room utilization for non-emergency care.  Low-income wage earners
would have, in effect, first-dollar coverage for medical care
up to the amount in their MSA.
<p>
<center><h3>LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS IN CONGRESS</h3></center>
<p>
Congress has proposed several variations of MSA legislation, but
generally this legislation has been designed to end the current
tax discrimination against MSAs.  MSAs are flexible and would
operate as a <I>tax-free</I>, portable account which can be used
to pay medical bills (including those for eyeglasses and dental
care), in conjunction with a high-deductible (or &quot;catastrophic&quot;)
health insurance plan.  Contributions made by employers, the self-employed
or individuals would be tax-free.  If one needs to withdraw money
for non-medical expenses, the funds are taxed and a 10 percent
penalty applies.
<p>
MSA proposals have gained bipartisan support but have never passed
in Congress.  Now, the 104th Congress has the chance to pass an
MSA bill, such as the Family Medical Savings and Investment Act
of 1995, H.R. 1818, introduced by Reps. Bill Archer (R-Texas)
and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.).  This bill allows contributions made
to MSAs by employers, the self-employed, and individuals to be
tax-deductible.  Through tax fairness, the bill also helps the
uninsured, future senior citizens, and employed mothers, who will
no longer be forced to accept full-time employment to receive
tax-deductible health coverage.  The estimated cost of H.R. 1818
is $1.77 billion over seven years, according to the Joint Committee
on Taxation.  Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) recently introduced
a virtually  identical MSA proposal in the Senate, S. 1247. 
<p>
Under H.R. 1818 and S. 1247, there are annual limits on the amount
of money that can be placed in such accounts ($2,500 for an individual
or $5,000 for a family).  A 10 percent penalty is levied if the
money is withdrawn for non-medical expenses.  In addition, money
for non-medical expenses is also taxed as income, since the money
was deposited tax free.  As in the case of IRAs, a 10 percent
penalty would encourage savings and discourage frivolous non-medical
spending. 
<p>
The MSA is essentially a trust created exclusively for the purpose
of paying qualified medical expenses (QME) of the account holder
and his or her family.   Distributions for QMEs are excluded from
gross income.  QMEs are defined by section 213 (d) of the IRS
code, except that MSA expenses for insurance premiums other than
catastrophic plans or long-term care insurance premiums would
not be included.
<p>
H.R. 1818 has passed the House Ways and Means Committee and will
be included in the budget reconciliation package for consideration
under &quot;closed rules&quot; on the House floor.  That means
no amendments may be offered.  The reconciliation bill is an omnibus
&quot;must-pass&quot; budget package slated for a vote in October.

</pre><p>
<ul>
<li>In  S. 1247, the amount of deposit is limited to the deductible
amount of the insurance policy or $2,500 for an individual or
$5,000 for a family.
<p>
<li>If this is used up in a year, the traditional or catastrophic
insurance plan kicks in. 
<p>
<li>If this is not used up in a year, the remainder can be retained
in the MSA to be used for next year's health expenses, or future
retirement (IRA) needs.
<p>
<li>Long-term care insurance policies can be purchased from the
MSA account.
<p>
<li>People laid-off or unemployed can use MSA funds to continue
to purchase high-deductible private health insurance.
</ul><p>
Let's say an employer, for example, will spend $4,000 per year
on health insurance for an individual.  The employer decides to
use that $4,000 for an MSA for his employee.  The employer purchases
a high-deductible insurance policy which costs $2,000 per year.
 The policy has a deductible of $2,500.  The employer then deposits
$2,000 into the MSA, from which the employee draws to meet routine
medical expenses.  Therefore, as an equation, the example above
would look like this: 
<p>
<center>
$4,000  =  $2,000 in premium costs for a health insurance policy<br>
with a $2,500 deductible  +  $2,000 deposited in the MSA
</center><p>
Next year, the employer deposits another $2,000 (usually in monthly
allotments) in the employee's MSA.  If the employee only spent
$1,000 the first year, then the employee would have $1,000 left
in the MSA at the beginning of the second year, when that year's
$2,000 would be deposited.  Therefore, the employee would have
$3,000 in the MSA at the beginning of the second year.  
<p>
Once initially set up, an MSA is useful in times of temporary
unemployment or in-between jobs.  The same <I>Journal of American
Health Policy</I> (cited above) reports that &quot;41 percent
of persons losing private health insurance have an uninsured spell
that ends within one to three months, and 71 percent have a dry
spell that ends within four months.&quot;   The &quot;portable&quot;
feature of  MSAs can prevent &quot;job lock&quot; - that is, a
situation in which someone feels &quot;forced&quot; to remain
in a job because of fear of losing good health benefits.   Those
unfortunate families who are chronically unemployed or earning
wages below the poverty level, will still be eligible for public
health programs, such as Medicaid and SSI, which will continue
to provide aid to the working poor.
<p>
<center><h3>TYPICAL FEATURES OF  H.R. 1818/S. 1247:</h3></center>
<p><ul>
<I>* tax free account, similar to IRA, for medical expenses</I><br>
<I>* employer or individual makes contribution (limit $)</I><br>
<I>* choose own doctor</I><br>
<I>* portable </I><br>
<I>* money in account rolls over year to year </I><br>
<I>* no claims, no new government bureaucracy or administrative
costs</I><br>
<I>* can withdraw savings for retirement at 59 1/2 years old</I><br>
<I>* 10 percent penalty for withdrawal for non-medical use</I><br>
<p></ul>
<center><h3>MEDICARE</h3></center>
<p>
As one possible alternative to Medicare, both House and Senate
committees have proposed  tax-free &quot;Medisave&quot; accounts,
similar to those proposed for working families, as a potential
option for seniors.  In the future, these Medisave accounts have
the potential to save seniors and the health care system money
by allowing personal account funds to be used to pay for expenses
not covered by the traditional health insurance plan, such as
prescription drugs or long-term care insurance premiums.   If
the money is spent wisely, there will be money left in the account
for next year's health expenses or for non-medical expenses (with
a small penalty).  This will help give the elderly and their families
an opportunity to best use the money.  It takes decisions away
from the Washington bureaucrats.  The House Ways and Means and
Senate Finance Committees have approved a medical savings account
option that combines a high-deductible insurance policy with a
Medicare MSA.   
<p>
<center><h3>SUMMARY</h3></center>
<p>
FRC believes Medical Savings Accounts are family-friendly health
care reform.  Ultimately, all health care reform legislation should
be judged within the following family-based guidelines:  
<p><ul>
<li>Fosters Genuine Compassion
<li>Makes Prudence Pay
<li>Promotes Family Autonomy
<li>Recognizes the Family's Contribution to Good Health
<li>Empowers Families to Act

<h2>YOUTH GANGS: OUT OF<br>
CONTROL AND GETTING<br>
WORSE</h2>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
A recent decline in violent crime appears to be more a result
of fewer teenagers than better law enforcement.  When the current
bumper crop of elementary-age children become adolescents, the
violent crime rate is likely to explode.
<p>
A growing chorus of experts warn of the impending youth crime
crisis.  Reggie Walton, a Washington, D.C. Superior Court judge
who handles juvenile cases, blames it on the disappearance of
fathers.  Walton says fathers leave children to be raised by young
mothers who themselves are often struggling with mental or emotional
problems, limited education, poverty and addiction.  Walton labels
these children &quot;walking time bombs.&quot;[1]
<p>
This time bomb has been in the making for some time.  Youth violent
crime has been rising dramatically for more than a decade.  Today,
and historically, young males commit far more crimes than other
age groups.
<p>
The volatile mix of more chronic juvenile delinquents and an upward
surge in youthful perpetrators of violence is complemented by
an unprecedented growth in youth living with little or no adult
supervision.  Consider some recent examples.
<p><ul>
<li>A Los Angeles family takes a wrong turn into gang territory
and is fired upon.  A 3-year-old is killed and her 2-year-old
brother wounded.
<p><li>A Chinese immigrant in Brooklyn is kidnapped by a Chinatown
gang which demands ransom payments from her family.  She is murdered
when the family fails to pay.
<p><li>Two FBI agents and a police sergeant are murdered inside the
Washington, D.C. police headquarters by a gang member.
<p><li>A Pittsburgh police sergeant walking home with his daughter
is killed with his own gun after he stops and confronts a gang
spraying graffiti on a street.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>WALKING TIME BOMBS</h3></center>
<p>
Vice President Albert Gore recently told the White House press
corps, &quot;Gangs have been a major cause of the growth in violent
crime in the past decade.&quot;[2] He cited a Treasury Department
report that found the presence of rival gangs, the Bloods and
the Crips, in 35 states and 58 cities across the country.
<p>
At the same press conference, Attorney General Janet Reno cited
the impact of disabling one gang in New Haven, Connecticut.  Eighteen
members of the &quot;Jungleboy&quot; street gang were put in jail,
and, according to Reno, New Haven's murder rate fell by one-third
in 1993.[3]
<p>
Given that youth gangs account for a disproportionate share of
youth violence, their potential for contributing to a future crime
wave is enormous.
<p>
At the current growth rate, there will be nearly half-a-million
more adolescent boys in the year 2010 than today.  That means
if current trends continue, we will have perhaps 30,000 more chronic
juvenile delinquents by the year 2010 than today.  Chronic youth
offenders comprise 7 percent of all male teenagers and they commit
70 percent of all serious crime for their age group.[4]
<p>
If history is any predictor, these adolescents will be more violent
than the current delinquents.  According to the Department of
Justice, today's youth are extremely violent.  Firearms are now
used by three-fourths of all juvenile homicide offenders and 
one-third of all reported violent crime offenders are less than
21 years old.  Juvenile arrests for all violent crime have increased
from 1983 to 1992 in spite of the decline in the overall number
of teenagers in the U.S. population.  The government estimates
that the juvenile arrest rate for major violent crime will more
than double by the year 2010.[5]
<p>
This ticking youth time bomb is evident everywhere.  California
authorities report that incarcerations of violent youth increased
from 44 percent of the prison population in 1987 to 61 percent
in 1992[6]. There is no sign of a turnaround.  Officials in the
upscale Washington, D.C. suburb of Fairfax, Virginia, report that
the number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes has climbed
61 percent since 1991.  The number of youth arrested with weapons
has risen 118 percent since 1989.[7]
<p>
A 1993 report by the Washington State Department of Community
Development states, &quot;Our state and nation are awash in a
tidal wave of violence, violence that has reached epidemic proportions
especially among our youngest generation.&quot;[8]
<p>
Professor Dean Rojek, a sociologist at the University of Georgia,
says, &quot;For decades violent crime was driven mostly by adults,
with kids involved mostly in property crime....What's been changing is 
that you have juveniles becoming much more involved in violent offenses, 
with the use of weapons. If we add to this more babies, you could have a 
multiplier effect...a mini explosion [in violent crime by youth].&quot;[9]
<p>
Attorney General Janet Reno agrees.  &quot;Unless we act now,&quot;
says Reno, &quot;to stop young people from choosing a life of
violence and crime, the beginning of the 21st century could bring
levels of violent crime to our community that far exceed what
we have experienced.&quot;[10]
<p>
<center><h3>GANGS EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM</h3></center>
<p>
The bomb's fuse is shortened by the youth gang phenomenon.  California
authorities describe the youth gang as a &quot;violent and insidious
new form of organized crime.  Heavily armed with sophisticated
weapons, (gangs) are involved in drug trafficking, witness intimidation,
extortion, and bloody territorial wars.  In some cases they are
traveling out of state to spread their violence and crime.&quot;[11]
<p>
According to the FBI,  &quot;The fastest growing murder circumstance
is juvenile gang killings.&quot;[12] Almost one-third of Los Angeles'
homicides are gang related.[13] Nationwide, the rate of violent offenses
by gang members is three times as high as for non-gang delinquents.[14]
<p>
There's something about young males belonging to a gang that makes
them more violent.
<p><ul>
<li>Orange County, California probation statistics indicate that
gang-related youth had significantly higher law-violation rates (55.1 percent) 
than non-gang affiliated youth (26.4 percent).[15] A study of 20 years of 
data collected by Philadelphia's police gang unit shows that &quot;gangs
engage in more violent behavior than do delinquent non-gang groups.&quot;[16]
<p>
<li>Metropolitan Life surveyed schools about gang violence.  It
found that more than half (59 percent) of law enforcement and one-third (34 
percent) of students and teachers say gang or group membership is a major
cause of violence in schools.[17]
<p>
<li>A study in Wisconsin found that most violent crimes by youths
were committed by groups of three or more.  This &quot;pack&quot; behavior, 
not surprisingly, seems to be at the core of much of the rise in youth
crime.[18]
<p>
<li>A study of New York City teenage gunshot victims found that
40 percent were shot during school hours.  Another study found that of 
children and teenagers wounded in drive-by shootings in Los Angeles, 71 
percent were &quot;documented members of street gangs.&quot;[19]
<p></ul>
Not only do gang members tend to be more violent than non-gang
members, but gang membership appears to prolong one's criminal
career.  One study found that a &quot;large portion of persistent
and dangerous juvenile gang offenders become even more serious
adult offenders.&quot;[20] Another study in California found that
previously-incarcerated gang members continued their lives of
crime after being released.[21]
<p>
<center><h3>GANGS - AN AMERICAN PHENOMENON?</h3></center>
<p>
As early as the 1600s, London was &quot;terrorized by a series
of organized gangs...[who] fought pitched battles among themselves
dressed with colored ribbons to distinguish the different factions.&quot;[22]
 Gang problems have been reported in most of Europe, the former
Soviet Union, Africa, South America, Mexico, New Zealand and Japan.
<p>
One of the first reports of youth gangs in America comes from
Philadelphia.  In 1791, that city's leaders convened a conference
to decide how to deal with bands of disruptive youth.[23]
<p>
New York City had a similar problem in the 19th century.  New
York's gangs tended to be political agents for the Know Nothing
or Native American Party.  During the early Civil War years there
were draft riots which may have been started by Irish street gangs.[24]
<p>
The classic movie, <I>West Side Story</I>, is stereotypical of
20th century gang life.  The Sharks and the Jets are territorial
gangs protecting their neighborhoods.  Until recently, however,
gangs like these were not considered a threat to the general population.
<p>
Neither a 1967 presidential commission on law enforcement nor
the 1976 National Advisory Committee on Criminal Standards and
Goals foresaw today's gang problem. They concluded, &quot;Youth
gangs are not now or [sic] should not become a major object of
concern....Youth gang violence is not a major problem in the United
States....What gang violence does exist can fairly readily be
diverted into 'constructive' channels, especially through the
provision of services by community agencies.&quot;[25]
<p>
<center><h3>WHY ARE GANGS SPREADING?</h3></center>
<p>
Gangs are spreading across the country and are not just limited
to major cities.  Bernard Friedlander, a University of Hartford psychology 
professor and a violence expert, says, &quot;This is an American problem, 
not an inner-city problem....It's spreading slowly....On one level it's 
simple fad imitation...but on another level the
isolation of youth is just as profound in some of the more stable
areas as in the inner city.&quot;[26]
<p>
Ed Edelman, a Los Angeles supervisor, said, &quot;Gangs are very
mobile today.  They don't just stay in one area.  They are not just limited 
to poor areas of the country.  They are all over the place.&quot;[27]
<p>
The spread of gangs can be attributed to at least three factors.
 First, parents, desiring to protect their gang-culture-saturated
children from the hometown gang's influence, send them to relatives
across the country.  Sometimes this strategy works.  But many
times it merely helps transplant the gang culture into a new community.
<p>
The drug trade has created entrepreneurial gangs which fan out
across the country to ply their trade and expand their markets.
 Franchises of the Bloods and the Crips are now in most metropolitan
centers.  With their expansion, they have introduced collateral,
gang-like violence.
<p>
Finally, the entertainment industry contributes to the spread
of gangs.  The gang culture, value system and mentality are sprinkled
across the country through movies, &quot;gangsta&quot; rap music
and now comic books.  These cultural amplifiers educate young
audiences to gang values and attitudes.  They denigrate women,
promote exaggerated manhood or  &quot;machismo,&quot; and glorify
violence.  They also pass on gang language, symbols, activities,
and traditions.[28]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG NUMBERS, LOCATION AND TYPES</h3></center>
<p>
According to Justice Department estimates, the United States has
some 1,436 gangs and 120,636 gang members.  They exist in large,
mid-sized and small communities and in suburban areas.[29]
<p>
The Justice Department figures are disputed by the National School
Safety Center, which in 1993 estimated that the Los Angeles area
alone has at least 959 gangs with approximately 125,000 gang members.[30]
 Another report states that more than 350,000 gang members reside
along the West Coast.[31] To further confuse the issue, a 1975 study
found a total of 760 to 2,700 gangs in the nation's eight largest
cities.[32]
<p>
There are many types of gangs.  Some are black, white, Asian,
Hispanic or other ethnic-centered gangs.  Others are structured
around territory, commercial activities, corporate businesses,
political agendas, religion, music and special types of crime.
<p><ul>
<li><B>Race/ethnic-based gangs</B>:  Larry Rawles, deputy director
of Philadelphia's Crisis Intervention Network, says, &quot;When any ethnic 
group was at the bottom, they formed gangs -- the Jews, the Irish, the 
Italians.&quot;[33] Gangs offered status, a sense of self-worth, 
and protection.  Today, most gangs are racially segregated (54.6
percent are African American and 32.6 percent are Hispanic).  Blacks and 
Hispanics constitute the largest numbers of youths arrested for gang 
offenses today.[34]
<p>
The all-black rival gangs, the Crips and the Bloods, have an estimated
70,000 members in Los Angeles County alone.[35] They have franchises
in most states and metropolitan communities where they tend to
dominate the crack cocaine trade.
<p>
Darlyne Pettinicchio, a probation officer in Orange County, California,
says, &quot;(White gangs are) punk rockers and heavy metalers
(who) come from all socio-economic classes.  They're of average
intelligence and they're capable youngsters.  They have very little
parental authority.  They're usually angry.  Their dance is violent.
 Their music is violent.  Their behavior is violent.  They're
into anarchy.&quot;[36]
<p>
There are numerous Hispanic, Satanic cult, Asian, and Stoner (punk
rock and heavy metal) gangs.  Each has a subculture and each tends
to be very violent and involved in the use and or distribution
of illicit drugs.
<p>
<li><B>Economic-based gangs</B>:  Some gangs are organized around
a commercial activity. Members may be all from a single race or the same 
neighborhood or they may be very diverse.  The glue that holds them together
is making money.
<p>
They often see themselves as Robin Hoods or Bonnie-and-Clyde types
who practice their own version of free enterprise.  A close cousin
is the corporate gang, which selects a type of industry or business
and dominates the field through intimidation and violence.   For
example, there was a Miami-based gang called the &quot;Mazda boys&quot;
who specialized in stealing Mazda cars.
<p>
<li><B>Territorial gangs</B>:  Territorial gangs can be from any
race or ethnic background. They lay claim to a particular territory. They 
typically &quot;tag&quot; their territory with gang graffiti and are 
willing to defend their turf to the death. When their territory is invaded 
the gang provides &quot;warriors.&quot;
<p></ul>
<center><h3>WHO JOINS A GANG?</h3></center>
<p>
No matter the type of gang, most gang members are male.  A Chicago
study of four police districts found that only 2 to 5 percent
of gang arrestees were female.[37] These females are typically auxiliary
gang members.
<p>
Gang members range in age from 8 to 22 years old, but there are
exceptions where tenure is often well beyond 22 to perhaps more
than 40 years old.[38] A counselor in a juvenile detention facility
in California said: &quot;(If) you find a gang member who comes
from a complete nuclear family, a kid who has never been exposed
to any kind of abuse, I'd like to meet him....a real 'gangbanger'
who comes from a happy, balanced home, who's got a good opinion
of himself.  I don't think that kid exists.&quot;[39]
<p>
Sydney Harris, a nationally syndicated columnist, said, &quot;Gang
members tend to be chronic losers, who can accomplish nothing
individually, or who live in so depressed an environment that
only by banding together can they exercise any influence over
their lives.  In both cases, they are as much to be pitied as
condemned.&quot;[40]
<p>
Allen Frazier, superintendent of schools for Plymouth, Connecticut,
blames economic problems.  &quot;As people have more economic
problems in the adult world,&quot; says Frazier, &quot;it transfers
to the young people as well....[The children] don't seem to have
a place where they are comfortable.  In order to seek that, sometimes
they end up with the security of a gang....It becomes an extended
family which they may not have.&quot;[41]
<p>
A gang researcher says, &quot;These gang kids have nothing to
do that they perceive as useful.  They are the disconnected, alienated
ones.  They identify with whatever is trendy in terms of music,
clothes, and in terms of behavior.  They are living entirely on
the surface of life.&quot;[42]
<p>
Prisons are often referred to as gang training schools.  Often
gangs are formed in prison and then emigrate to the streets. 
The cohesion associated with jail time amplifies gang loyalty.
<p>
Fred Williams, the executive director for Common Ground Foundation,
a Watts [Los Angeles, California] nonprofit organization that
works with gang youth, says, &quot;Prison doesn't scare them.
 It's a home away from home.&quot;[43]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG CULTURE</h3></center>
<p>
Professor Cornel West, a Princeton University social scholar,
says in his book <I>Race Matters</I> that the nihilistic thinking
of the inner city black community sets the stage for gang formation.
 West says, &quot;The frightening result is a numbing detachment
from others and a self-destructive disposition toward the world.
 Life without meaning, hope, and love breeds a cold-hearted, mean-spirited
outlook that destroys both the individual and others.&quot;[44]
<p>
The youth gang satisfies a void.  It provides the child a sense
of identity, belonging, power, and protection.  The gang satisfies
the child's desire to feel secure.  Living in a high-risk environment
without paternal protection, the young gangster satisfies his
insecurities by aligning himself with a gang, his surrogate family.
 The gang provides a protective barrier against the outside forces.
<p>
One gang member says, &quot;Being in a gang means if I didn't
have no family, I think that's where I'll be.  If I didn't have
no job that's where I'd be.  To me it's community help without
all the community.  They'll understand better than my mother and
father.&quot;[45]
<p>
His new &quot;family&quot; has a distinct set of values that affect
every aspect of his life.  According to the Los Angeles District
Attorney, the gang culture is radically different from the mainline
culture.  &quot;It confronts and confounds adult authority on
every level -- sex, work, power, love, education, language, dress,
music, drugs, alcohol, violence.  As icons of popular culture,
gangs not only represent a powerful group identity utterly inaccessible
to adults, they are surrounded with an appealing aura of outlaw
danger.&quot;[46]
<p>
Visible manifestations of the gang culture include colors, signs,
symbols, graffiti, and tattoos.  Gang colors, different types
of clothing and head covering help distinguish one gang from another.
 Even some National Football League players who are connected
to gangs wear gang-colored bandanas.
<p>
Gangs often have their peculiar vocabulary.  Many black street
gangs address each other as &quot;cuz&quot; for cousin.  They
often have code words and many speak like &quot;rappers.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Tagging&quot; their territory with gang graffiti is common.
 It proclaims the presence of the gang and offers a challenge
to rivals.  It may claim credit for a crime.  The denser the graffiti,
the closer one is to the gang's core territory.  The Crips often
mark &quot;B/K&quot; for &quot;Bloods killers.&quot;
<p>
Gang behavior is characterized by extreme loyalty.  Members never
inform on &quot;homeboys,&quot; even if faced with death.  Once
in a gang, the member faces long odds of ever leaving alive.
<p>
Captain Russell Holyfield of the Hartford Police Department describes
gang protocol.  &quot;You give someone a dirty look,&quot; says
Holyfield, &quot;or say something about their girlfriend and later
on that day, you're a target.&quot;[47]
<p>
A Los Angeles District Attorney gang study describes the macho-psychology
of the gang culture.  &quot;The gang's ideal man is virtually
identical to the romantic myth of the gunfighter of the Old West
-- a two-fisted, hard-drinking, dangerous man who is quick to
avenge any insult; he lives and dies by violence, with his exploits
rousing fear and respect in the hearts of men, and in the hearts
of women, fear and desire.&quot;[48]
<p>
&quot;Gangsta&quot; rap is filled with messages that glorify violence,
extreme abuse of women and disrespect for authority.  The rapper's
lyrics paint a realistic picture of daily gangster activity.
<p>
Despite this, some gangs have an odd sense of civility.  A Los
Angeles Hispanic gang member says, &quot;When I'm out on the streets,
I know I'm safe if I'm with my mom.  You don't disrespect anybody
if they are with their mom.&quot;[49]
<p>
Partying and fighting, the core activities of a gang, are what
draw many young males.  According to the Los Angeles District
Attorney's report, &quot;These are the things that build and define
group loyalties.  Even criminality, which is probably the public's
main perception of what gangs are about, is less a core value
of the gang than a byproduct of the emphasis on partying and fighting.&quot;[50]
<p>
Sergeant Joe Guzman with the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department
explains prison's influence on the gang culture:  &quot;One prison
gang member might see that another gang member had something he
wanted.  If he was larger, more powerful or had more back-up from
his 'homeboys' than the other inmate, he literally just took the
item he wanted.  If he was angered in one fashion or another he
retaliated with deadly vengeance and commanded the presence of
his entire gang to back him up.&quot;[51]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG ORGANIZATION</h3></center>
<p>
Gangs are loosely organized.  Some are part of larger structures
known as &quot;nations,&quot; which are networked nationwide.
 But most are loosely knit groups with several leaders.
<p>
The 1960 New York City Youth Board proposed a theory of gang structure,
stating gangs are structured both vertically and horizontally.
 The vertical gang is structured along age lines and draws members
from local neighborhoods.  The horizontal gang has older members
who are drawn from a larger area.[52] This type of gang tends to
evolve into coalitions, supergangs and nations.  The term &quot;supergang&quot;
was coined in Chicago in the late 1960s to describe a gang with
thousands of members.[53]
<p>
Virtually every gang is built from groups called &quot;cliques.&quot;
 One gang researcher called the clique a &quot;spontaneous interest
group usually of the conflict type which forms itself within some
larger social structure such as a gang.&quot;[54] Members of cliques
tend to be similar in age.
<p>
Gang leaders are chosen by natural selection based on the person's
age, physical stature, arrest record and behavior.  Like any organization,
according to one researcher, the &quot;ability to get along with
people is one of the basic skills associated with gang leadership.&quot;[55]
<p>
Some gangs have formal leaders known as king, prince, prime minister,
general, don, or chief .  Others are informal, known as &quot;shot
callers&quot; or &quot;shooters.&quot;   Leadership responsibilities
may be shared and based upon a &quot;collection of functions that
may be undertaken at various times by a number of members.&quot;[56]
<p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
&quot;We've got so many kids out there who've lost hope, who believe
in only living for today,&quot; says John Turner, chief of police
for the city of Mountlake Terrace, Washington. &quot;They join
a gang and get involved in criminal activity because there aren't
any people taking them by the hand in simple terms and pointing
them in the right direction, giving them self-esteem and positive
feedback.&quot;[57]
<p>
Perhaps gangs exist because modern society has failed to harness
the male hunter/predator instinct and converted those energies
to familial provider/protector efforts.  Delinquent young people
lacking values, conscience or a sense of remorse can easily find
themselves drawn to the gang lifestyle.
<p>
Noted author James Q. Wilson writes in <I>The Moral Sense</I>
that modern society with its &quot;rapid technological change,
intense division of labor, and ambiguous allocation of social
roles, frequently leaves some men out, with their aggressive predispositions
either uncontrolled or undirected.  Gangs are one result.&quot;[58]
<p>
Wilson says the profits from illegal drug sales provide gang members
economic opportunities which combine with their uncontrolled aggression
to develop a &quot;warrior culture that underinvests in family
life.&quot;
<p>
Converting male energy to familial provider/protector efforts
has always been the task of the intact family.  But the nuclear
family is declining, especially in predominantly black inner cities
where gangs dominate life and rain violent crime.  Many of these
children join gangs to find purpose, security, and self-esteem.
 The gang culture gives them a sense of belonging and remakes
their value system.  Partying, fighting, and vicious gang loyalty
become their primary values, thus pushing aside virtues that favor
family life.  This is a vicious cycle and it must be broken.
<p>
Defusing the youth crime bomb must include a strategy to dismantle
the growing youth gang movement.  Gangs are the powder magazine
-- they must be dealt with before the bomb goes off.

<title>CONGRESS MAY FORM A COMMISSION TO STUDY LEGALIZED GAMBLING</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/insight/insight.gif">
<p>
<h2>CONGRESS MAY FORM A<br>
COMMISSION TO STUDY<br>
LEGALIZED GAMBLING</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
America is experiencing a wave of legalized gambling. Some consider
government-sponsored betting a financial godsend, but for others
it is a social and economic disaster that will stop only when
the public says enough is enough.
<p>
Gambling has grown in an ad hoc manner with states and cities
emulating others that appear to be successful. Officials look
with envy as citizens go to other states and cities to wager.
But as one politician who led the battle to legalize gambling
in Atlantic City warned, &quot;Casino gambling is not a 'try it
and see' experiment. Once the casino opens and the dice begin
to roll, gambling creates an instant constituency. People depend
on it for jobs. Governments depend on it for revenues.&quot;[1]
<p>
Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) has introduced legislation intended to
discover the true nature of gambling. Wolf's bill, the National
Gambling Impact and Policy Commission Act, calls for the creation
of a two-year commission to study gambling. The Act was approved
by voice vote November 8, 1995, by the House Judiciary Committee
and is expected to see House floor debate in 1996.[2]
<p>
A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate by Paul Simon
(D-Ill.) and Richard Lugar (R-Ind.).[3] The proposed commission will
examine policies and practices with respect to legalization or
prohibition of gambling and make recommendations for legislation
and administrative action.
<p>
This legislation is considered necessary because of the gradual
creation of 37 state lotteries and the expansion of casino gambling
to 23 states (prompted in part by the Indian Gaming Regulatory
Act of 1988) as well as an avalanche of gaming promoters selling
government officials on the economic benefits of legalization.
These sponsors sell legalization as an economic boon and a harmless
recreational pastime, but there is considerable evidence that
this rush to easy money actually costs the taxpayer more than
it harvests.
<p>
Columnist William Safire speaks for many when he labels gambling
&quot;a $40-billion-a-year industry that is inherently immoral,
corrupting public officials, enriching criminals, addicting and
impoverishing the young and the vulnerable.&quot;[4] He supports
the legislation now pending in the 104th Congress.
<p>
According to Congressman Wolf's bill, the proposed federal commission
would consider 11 broad areas. The following summarizes what is
already known about some of these areas.
<p>
<center><h3>ECONOMIC IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
Tunica County, Mississippi was known as the poorest county in
the country. In January 1992, it had an unemployment rate of 26.2
percent and a per capita income of $11,865. More than half of
its citizens were on food stamps.[5]
<p>
Since legalized gambling came to Tunica County, land values have
skyrocketed from $250 to $25,000 per acre. Over a billion dollars
in building permits have been granted. The nine area casinos each
average 1,000 employees, bringing unemployment down to 4.9 percent.
Child support collections have doubled, welfare benefits have
been nearly halved, food stamp recipients have decreased and property
taxes have been cut one-third.[6]
<p>
Webster Franklin, executive director of the Tunica County chamber
of commerce, is a gambling fan. He told a House committee in September
1995 that gambling is the best thing to happen to his county.
<p>
Such reports cause officials of money-strapped government agencies
to salivate. Detroit, for example, equates casinos with economic
salvation. For years, gambling citizens have crossed the Detroit
River to make wagers in Canada.
<p>
John Kelly, a lawyer and former Michigan state senator who opposed
gambling when he was in the legislature, now works for a local
investment group. He said the presence of Canadian casinos across
the river has been persuasive to him. He wants Detroit to reap
some of the profit from gambling rather than watch locals cross
the border to wager. Michigan Governor John Engler has appointed
an 11-member commission to study whether an Indian-run casino
would benefit the city.[7]
<p>
The story in Mobile, Alabama, is quite different. Mayor Mike Dow
believed that $63 million was spent by Alabama residents at nearby
Gulfport, Mississippi gambling casinos. When Mayor Dow investigated
bringing casinos to his city, he found the price was too high.
<p>
Forty-one of Mobile's social service agency CEO's were tasked
to determine the probable effects of introducing casinos. The
five-month study found that introducing casinos would cost the
city $15 million more each year in increased social service costs.
<p>
Charles White, CEO, Franklin Memorial Health Care Center of Mobile,
said, &quot;Our social service staff is already seeing an impact
from casinos in Mississippi....We see families selling their food
stamps and WIC vouchers for gambling money, and we are aware of
one family who lost its home.&quot;[8]
<p>
Joyce Collier, executive director of Mobile's Family Counseling
Center, states: &quot;[in the Biloxi/Gulfport area] families have
lost everything that they have worked for in terms of physical
holdings....Some clients have pawned car titles and lost transportation....Our
family counselors report increased alcohol and drug abuse and
spouse abuse.&quot;[9]
<p>
In 1994, Florida governor Lawton Chiles sponsored an economic
impact study of gambling. He found that Florida could anticipate
gambling revenues ranging from $324 to $469 million each year,
but that collateral costs outstripped the gain. Sales tax revenues
would drop $84.7 million, and crime and social costs attributable
to casinos were estimated to reach between $2.16 and $3.8 billion
annually.[10]
<p>
University of Nevada professor of public administration William
Thompson explained Florida's dilemma. Casinos generate significant
new tax revenues &quot;only if they can export their product.
The local economy doesn't benefit if only local people are gambling.&quot;[11]
Florida's geography is unlike Atlantic City and Las Vegas, which
draw gamblers from other states and send them packing with the
residue of gambling pathologies. That tab is absorbed by the gamblers'
home states. But Florida believes most of its potential gamblers
would be residents and not out-of-state tourists.
<p>
National gambling expert Robert Goodman studied the industry's
claims of economic benefits for the Ford Foundation and the Aspen
Institute. He says there is a critical lack of objective knowledge
and research about the real economic and social costs and benefits
of legalizing gambling. He warns that the research often used
by public officials tends to be unbalanced because it has been
provided by the gambling industry.[12]
<p>
Goodman's 1994 study analyzed 14 gambling industry studies concluding
that &quot;hiding the costs&quot; of gambling was widespread and
gambling acted as &quot;economic cannibalism&quot; on pre-existing
economies and other businesses.[13]
<p>
John Kindt, a professor of commerce at the University of Illinois,
has estimated that for every dollar that states take in from gambling
they pay three dollars to social agencies and crime fighting.
A problem gambler costs the state an average of $13,000 a year
in social impact.[14]
<p>
<center><h3>IMPACT ON BUSINESS</h3></center>
<p>
Louisiana gambled and is now paying the price. That state legalized
riverboat gambling and a few land-based casinos several years
ago. Recent events show the error of that decision.
<p>
Mike Foster, a Republican who ran on an anti-gambling platform,
was recently elected governor. He promises a state referendum
on gambling's future within a year.[15]
<p>
Additionally, on November 22, 1995 Harrah's Jazz Company, a consortium
that was building a 200,000-square-foot casino on New Orleans's
Canal Street, filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy law. This action caused the layoff of 3,500 workers
and a net loss of $23.6 million each year for the city. Why? Because
the temporary casino was doing poorly. Gambling investors miscalculated
the appeal of gambling.[16]
<p>
Gambling is leading many communities into economic distress. Atlantic
City has created 43,000 jobs over 10 years, but now the city has
only one business -- gambling. When casinos first came to Atlantic
City, there were 2,100 thriving small businesses. Today the number
is near 1,100 and falling. According to a New Jersey commission
report, &quot;It is clear that retail business and retail employment
in Atlantic City have continued to decline despite the presence
of gambling, and that rampant speculation has rendered the development
of vast parts of Atlantic City difficult if not impossible.&quot;[17]
<p>
In Illinois it was hoped that an economic facelift would result
when riverboats were introduced. But Earl L. Grinols, a University
of Illinois economist, examined the economic data in April 1994.
He found that &quot;riverboat gambling did not create the jobs
that were promised and had very little effect on reducing unemployment.&quot;[18]
He concluded, &quot;Economically speaking, it appears that riverboat
casinos shift jobs as opposed to creating jobs. For example, the
number of independent restaurants drops when a casino opens up.
Car sales have been known to go down with the onset of gambling.&quot;[19]
<p>
A survey by Chicago's Better Government Association (BGA) of 324
business owners in Illinois' riverboat towns found that a majority
said the floating casinos had no effect or a negative effect on
their businesses. BGA director J. Terrence Brunner said, &quot;Clearly,
riverboat gambling has not met the criteria set forth by Illinois
legislators when they sold this to the citizens of Illinois. The
economic development we found was marginal at best. It has not
spurred economic development. It has not created jobs. It has
not boosted tourism, and it certainly has not brought new life
to Illinois rivers or beautified their banks.&quot;[20]
<p>
Jeffrey Bloomberg, state's attorney, Lawrence County, South Dakota,
told the House Committee on Small Business on September 21, 1995,
that since 1988 when casino gambling was legalized for Deadwood,
South Dakota, life has been a nightmare. Real estate values have
skyrocketed, taxes have risen and gaming revenues have been eaten
up by increased administrative, law enforcement and infrastructure
costs.[21]
<p>
When casino gambling swept into three Colorado towns, it radically
changed life for the worse. According to a 1992 <I>Wall Street
Journal</I> article, &quot;[I]nstead of a few slot machines, full-blown
casinos owned by Las Vegas veterans and real-estate developers
have swept in, swallowing many mom-and-pop businesses along the
way. Water, sewer and traffic systems have been overwhelmed, crime
has increased, non-casino businesses face huge tax increases and
the relative calm of local politics has been shattered.&quot;[22]
<p>
Many communities with gambling experience are discovering the
hollow promises of the sponsors of this get-rich-quick industry.
Gambling creates many low paying jobs, diverts consumer dollars
into gambling, cannibalizes small businesses, and saddles those
that remain with burdensome tax liabilities. Gambling has a cumulative
negative economic impact.[23]
<p>
<center><h3>POLITICS AND PUBLIC POLICY IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
The gambling industry is sophisticated when it comes to getting
what it wants. Consider the Mashantucket Pequot Indians' gambling
operations in Connecticut.
<p>
Today, the 370-member Pequot tribe operates a 17-story, 1,229-room
hotel and casino facility that draws 50,000 visitors a day. The
facility is managed by Gerald Michael Brown, a former New Jersey
deputy attorney general. Brown recently failed to win state support
to expand Pequot gambling to Bridgeport, a New York City suburb,
but it wasn't for lack of trying.[24]
<p>
Brown hired a law firm for $100,000 a month to prowl the halls
of Connecticut's capitol to sway lawmakers. The Pequot tribe ran
television commercials and sent out direct mail appeals touting
the financial benefits for the taxpayer. The cumulative effort
cost the tribe $13 million over four years. The fact is that the
Pequots contribute more to the state coffers than any single organization.[25]
But in November 1995, the state senate, by a majority of 24-10,
shot down the proposal. Count on a comeback.
<p>
The Pequots are generous on the national scene as well. In 1994,
the tribe contributed $215,000 in soft money to the Democratic
party and $465,000 to the Republicans. The industry's total public
contributions for 1993-1994 were $1,642,229.[26] But that doesn't
account for all contributions.
<p>
In June 1995, Steve Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts Inc., hosted
a fund-raiser for Senator Robert Dole (R-Kan.) that took in $477,450.
GOP chairman Haley Barbour isn't embarrassed by gambling money.
He said, &quot;It's not my place to be judgmental about issues
when it comes to allowing people to support us...you don't have
to agree with the Republican party on every issue to support us.&quot;[27]
<p>
Wynn is the genius behind the gaming industry's growth explosion,
according to John L. Smith, who writes in<I> Running Scared</I>
that Wynn has &quot;been accused of shadow-waltzing precariously
close to the wise-guy world.&quot; He dealt with a front man for
the Genovese crime family, and one of his associates was a point
man for Chicago mob lieutenant Johnny Rosselli, according to Smith,
who says Wynn was also associated with convicted junk bond felon
Michael Milken.[28]
<p>
The gambling industry understands the importance of politics.
That's why it hired Frank Fahrenkopf, a Nevada lawyer and former
Republican National Committee chairman. He now heads a $4 million
trade group, the American Gambling Association. This group, financed
by the gambling industry, promotes on Capitol Hill the positive
economic benefits of gambling.[29]
<p>
Gambling money and its agents have often been associated with
political corruption. Federal agents are investigating possible
political corruption in Louisiana. In 1995, senior state legislators
allegedly were caught discussing taking bribes from video-poker
lobbyists. Louisiana State Senator Jay Darnemme states, &quot;Greed,
arrogance, money and power -- it's all there....we went into this
very recklessly. Any states considering gambling ought not use
our formula as a model.&quot;[30]
<p>
The speaker of Missouri's House of Representatives resigned under
a cloud of gambling-related political corruption. In August 1991, FBI agents
in Columbia, South Carolina, wrapped up &quot;Operation Lost Trust,&quot;
which resulted in the bribery-related conviction of numerous legislators
and lobbyists.[31]
<p>
Six Arizona legislators pleaded guilty in 1990 to accepting gambling
bribes and that same year seven Kentucky officials were found
guilty of accepting bribes and making false statements. In 1994,
the West Virginia lottery director was sentenced to federal prison
for rigging a video lottery contract.[32]
<p>
The Clinton Administration has been cozy with the Seminole Tribe
of Florida. Clinton's Solicitor General, Drew Days, filed a last
minute, friend-of-the-court brief in the U.S. Supreme Court siding
with the Seminole Indians' case against the state of Florida.
The Seminoles want casino gambling and say Florida has not been
faithful to the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
<p>
President Clinton's outsider support of the Seminoles waves a
red flag in the face of anti-gambling forces. A check of Florida-based
gaming contributors to the 1996 Clinton/Gore Primary Committee
Inc. found only $6,000, however.[33]
<p>
With annual wagers nationwide now topping half-a-trillion dollars
and gambling profits over $40 billion, there is great opportunity
for corruption.
<p>
<center><h3>GAMBLING AND CRIME</h3></center>
<p>
On October 16, 1995, Joseph Curran, Jr., Maryland's attorney general,
published that state's analysis of the link between gambling and
crime. Curran said, &quot;Casinos would bring a substantial increase
in crime to our state.&quot;[34]
<p>
The Maryland report reflects what virtually every government that
has experienced gambling has found. Jeffrey Bloomberg said, when
casinos came to remote Deadwood, &quot;We have seen individuals
who, prior to their exposure to gambling, had no criminal history,
who were not junkies or alcoholics, many of whom had good jobs,
who became hooked on slot machines and, after losing all their
assets and running all credit resources to their maximum, began
committing some type of crime to support their addiction.&quot;[35]
<p>
Crime on Mississippi's gulf coast increased in every category
after legalization of gambling. Gulfport's chief of police found
overall crime increased more than 100 percent, juvenile crime
shot up 65 percent and alcohol-related accidents increased 101
percent.[36]
<p>
In the first three years after casinos came to Atlantic City,
it went from 50th to first in the nation in per capita crime.
In the first 15 years Atlantic City had casinos, violent crime
skyrocketed almost 500 percent. This was in spite of a 20 percent
population decrease.[37]
<p>
Crime rose 262 percent in Deadwood and police calls in Black Hawk,
Colorado increased from 25 per year before gaming, to as many
as 20,000 today.[38]
<p>
Congressman Wolf testified on September 29, 1995, &quot;Evidence
shows that pathological gamblers engage in forgery, theft, embezzlement,
drug dealing and property crimes to pay off gambling debts. Various
studies indicate that the mean gambling-related debt of people
in compulsive gambling therapy ranged from about $53,000 to $92,000.&quot;[39]
<p>
Durand F. Jacobs, a professor of psychiatry at California's Loma
Linda University and a gambling industry consultant, says that
most people who commit crimes to support their gambling had no
prior criminal records.[40]
<p>
Florida's Department of Law Enforcement studied the probable crime
impact of legalizing gambling and concluded it would cause an
increase in many crime categories. They include: robberies, rape,
theft, drug abuse, aggravated assault, counterfeiting, profit-skimming,
prostitution, credit card scams, loan sharking, and card cheats.[41]
<p>
Given the huge number of dollars involved, gambling legalization
attracts organized crime. Jim Moody, chief of the FBI'S Organized
Crime Section, told <I>60 Minutes</I>, &quot;Gambling itself --
is probably the biggest producer of money for the American La
Cosa Nostra [that] there is.&quot;[42] A former Chicago mobster told
a congressional committee, the introduction of legalized gaming
into Illinois &quot;created a brand new market for us.&quot;[43]
<p>
In 1995, 18 men linked to the Genovese and Gambino crime families
in New York and the Marcello crime family in New Orleans were
convicted of secretly trying to operate a video-poker company
in New Orleans.[44]
<p>
For these reasons Maryland's attorney general Curran warned, &quot;Whatever
dubious financial benefits might flow from casino gaming are outweighed
by the tremendous social costs. Casinos would forever damage the
quality of Maryland life. I urge the task force and the people
of this state to resist the temptation of money that would benefit
too few at the cost of too many.&quot;[45]
<p>
<center><h3>SOCIAL IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
Americans make more trips to casinos than to major league ballparks,
making gambling the new national pastime. This is evidenced by
the creation of casinos in 23 states and a projection that, by
the year 2000, most Americans will be within a four-hour drive
of a casino.[46]
<p>
This phenomenon is not without social consequences. The American
Psychiatric Association says that gambling addiction parallels
the devastation of alcohol and drug addictions.[47] Although less
than 1 percent of the population have been identified as gambling
addicts, the legalization of gambling could cause that number
to grow to 5 percent, and that includes teenagers.[48]
<p>
Tom Fennelly, a counselor with Gamblers Anonymous, says people
with gambling problems wait to get help until they do something
that bothers their conscience. He told of one woman who became
a prostitute to pay for gambling.[49]
<p>
Robert Goodman reports in the United States Gambling Study that
there are 9.3 million adults and 1.3 million adolescents with
a gambling problem. These are often lower-income residents, and
problem behaviors are worst among the poor and minorities.[50]
<p>
Gambling has caused increased family breakup, suicide, crime,
and massive personal debt. Jason Berg, a 19-year-old from a small
Iowa town, committed suicide after running up gambling debts.
He left a note: &quot;I'm out of control.&quot; Howard Russell,
a 41-year-old salesman, shot himself outside an Illinois casino
after losing more than $50,000.[51] <I>The Kansas City Star</I> reported
the tragic story of a mother who killed herself because she gambled
away the family savings at a casino riverboat.[52]
<p>
The social costs from pathological gambling are high. Peter Reuter,
executive director of the Maryland Task Force on Casino Gambling,
states, there is &quot;no convincing estimate of the average social
costs of an individual becoming a pathological gambler,&quot;
but the &quot;annual costs of $100 million or more in Maryland&quot;
is reasonable.[53]
<p>
Professor Kindt told the House Committee on the Judiciary on September
29, 1995, that the &quot;average socio-economic cost per compulsive
gambler per year has been calculated at $53,000.&quot;[54]
<p>
<center><h3>THE GAMBLER</h3></center>
<p>
Where do gamblers come from? Many gaming supporters count on diverting
funds from other states. They were surprised when a survey by
the Wisconsin Policy Institute of automobile license tags and
the patrons at a Wisconsin-based Indian tribe casino revealed
that nearly 80 percent were local people.[55]
<p>
Paul Dworn, the former editor of a leading gambling trade journal,
argued that most people go to casinos to be entertained: &quot;They
do not go because they have or want to win money.&quot;[56] But gaming
is not like going to Disneyworld or a ball game. It attracts people
who often can't afford the consequences, and it has proven to
be addictive.
<p>
The Wisconsin Policy Institute found that the typical casino gambler
is between 50 and 70 years old and has either retired or has a
blue-collar job. He or she wagers about $101 and loses about half
that amount during each visit.[57]
<p>
A 1995 survey done for the Iowa Department of Human Services found
that the availability of legalized gambling leads to increases
in the prevalence of gambling-related difficulties. Problem gamblers
are increasingly likely to be male, under the age of 30, non-Caucasian
and unmarried. The survey found that 3.5 percent are lifetime
problem gamblers and 1.9 percent are lifetime probable pathological
gamblers.[58]
<p>
Recent studies found lifetime gambling participation rates range
from a low of 74 percent to a high of 92 percent.[59] Iowa's survey
found that respondents spent an average of $40 per month gambling.
Men spend twice as much on gambling as women. People under age
30 spend twice what older gamblers spend. Singles spend more on
gambling ($51 per month) than marrieds ($31 per month).[60]
<p>
The economic strain on gamblers is often crippling. Kansas City's
Family Policy Council found that lower-income households spend
five to 10 times as much per capita on lottery tickets as do middle-income
homes. Since casinos came to Missouri, there has been a dramatic
increase in the number of pawn shops. Today, Kansas City has 38
shops, compared to four in 1979. Twelve shops opened within 18
months of the establishment of riverboat gambling.[61]
<p>
A Kansas City pawn shop owner said, &quot;You see people come
in here who can't afford to buy groceries, but they pawn their
VCR and go to the boat, where they lose $500.&quot; St. Louis'
Gamblers Anonymous reports that gamblers get money from their
life insurance and more than a third actually cancel their policies.
Nearly $1.3 billion of insurance fraud is committed each year
by pathological gamblers.[62]
<p>
The legalization of gambling and the number of pathological gamblers
appear to be linked, and some researchers believe gambling is
the fastest-growing addiction among teenagers. Henry Lesieur, Chair of 
the Criminal Justice Department at Illinois State University, headed a 1991 
panel that studied gambling among college students. The panel surveyed six 
schools in five states and concluded that almost one-quarter of students 
gamble at least once a week.[63]
<p>
Arnie Wexler, executive director of the Council on Compulsive
Gambling of New Jersey, estimates that the number of problem gamblers
will grow as the industry expands. He graphically portrays gambling's
temptation for some. &quot;If you put a guy who wouldn't cheat
on his wife in a room with a gorgeous nude woman, some guys would
fall by the wayside.&quot;[64] While this scenario would not excuse
a man from cheating, Wexler argues that, in the same way, state
approved gambling encourages many people to bet and a certain
percentage will become pathological.
<p>
<center><h3>GAMBLING REGULATION</h3></center>
<p>
Today, there are six major sectors of legal gambling: lotteries,
casino-style gambling, pari-mutuel racing, non-profits (including
bingo and Las Vegas nights), Indian high-stakes bingo and mini-casinos.
Regulating this rapidly expanding industry is expensive and complicated.
<p>
The state of Florida estimated it would cost nearly $50 million
to regulate 34 casinos, and that figure isn't unrealistic.[65] After
all, the 1991 annual budget for New Jersey's Casino Control Commission
was nearly $26 million, and that state's casinos are concentrated
in one city, not spread across a large state.[66]
<p>
But gaming regulation costs don't stop there. The New Jersey Division
of Gaming Enforcement spends another $36 million annually, a portion
of which provides police personnel for patrol and investigative
functions.[67]
<p>
The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 created a federal commission
to set gaming rules and oversee regulation of Indian bingo games.
The federal regulation effort is scanty, however. There are less
than 30 staff persons to regulate hundreds of Indian casinos across
the nation.[68]
<p>
Bob Renneisen, president and CEO, Claridge's Casino, Atlantic
City said, &quot;Our goal is not to get more out of a customer
in three hours but to get him to stay for four hours.&quot;[69] He
figures that the gambler will lose more with time since all casino
games give the house a mathematical edge.
<p>
The industry has studied gambling psychology. The casinos don't
want the gambler to realize he is losing. Jack Binion, owner of
Horseshoe Casino, Las Vegas, said, &quot;What is gambling? It's
really just a hype on emotion.&quot; Bill Zneder, operations chief,
Aladdin Casino, Las Vegas, said, &quot;If you give a guy a $100
bill he looks at it like a round of golf, a golf cart, two beers
and a hot dog. But if you give him chips, it's just betting units
and it loses its value.&quot;[70]
<p>
<center><h3>ADVERTISING GAMBLING</h3></center>
<p>
As governments have become more dependent on gambling, their regulation
efforts have shifted somewhat to promotion. According to gambling
expert Robert Goodman, legislators are tending to legalize-higher-revenue
producing games just as the market is becoming saturated.[71] This
is why public subsidies have been used to help competing private
gambling operations survive.
<p>
Since 1934, the federal government has had a long-standing policy
of prohibiting gambling-related advertising. Current federal criminal
law generally prohibits anyone from broadcasting &quot;[a]ny advertisement
of or information concerning any lottery, gift enterprise, or
similar scheme, [or] offering prizes dependent in whole or in
part upon lot or chance.&quot;[72]
<p>
The law does permit not-for-profit organizations to advertise
if the activity is &quot;clearly occasional and ancillary to the
primary business of that organization.&quot; But that might soon
change.
<p>
Pro-gambling forces in the Senate tried to amend the Telecommunications
Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 to &quot;allow commercial
gambling enterprises to advertise on radio and television, thereby
reversing a long-standing federal policy against commercial gambling
advertising.&quot;[73]
<p>
State governments already spend more than $300 million a year
in lottery advertisements.[74] Taxpayer funded pro-gambling ads mixed
with industry-paid ads could fill the airways with messages that
promote gambling, thus drawing in more gullible victims.
<p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
Despite its popularity, legalized gambling is taking the country
in the wrong direction. Gambling is not an economic savior but
a disease that claims millions of victims.
<p>
President Clinton supports Congressman Wolf's proposal. In a letter
to Senator Simon, Clinton said, &quot;Too often, public officials
view gambling as a quick and easy way to raise revenues, without
focusing on gambling's hidden social, economic and political costs.&quot;
<p>
A national gambling commission could examine and publicize the
devastating consequences of legalized gambling. After the commission,
public policymakers should consider legislation to re-criminalize
or severely limit all forms of gambling.

<p>
The Federal Communications Commission is considering a set of
rules that would greatly increase federal oversight of children's
television programming.
<p>
In order to further implement the Children's Television Act of
1990, the FCC is considering:
<p><ul>
<li>Issuing a &quot;more particularized&quot; definition of &quot;educational
and informational&quot; content.
<p><li>Requiring commercial broadcasters to carry a quota of 
&quot;educational&quot; programming, or pay another (probably a Public 
Broadcasting Service affiliate) to carry an equivalent amount of such 
programming.
<p><li>Adopting licensing renewal &quot;processing guidelines&quot;
which would allow the FCC to refuse license renewal to broadcasters
if program quotas are not met.
<p><li>Restricting credit for &quot;educational&quot; fare to designated
&quot;core&quot; programming (which would eliminate consideration
of specials and public service spots that might otherwise be deemed
&quot;educational&quot;).
<p><li>Requiring on-air designations of programs as &quot;educational.&quot;
<p><li>Defining as &quot;educational&quot; those programs for which
educational content is a &quot;significant purpose&quot; of the
show.
<p><li>Excluding for credit any programs that air before 7 a.m. and
after 10 p.m.
<p><li>Monitoring the total amount of educational and informational
programming over a specific time period.
</ul><p>
Given that the worth of specifically &quot;educational&quot; programming
for children is debatable, that public television already provides
many hours of such programming, and that the networks have steadily
increased their &quot;educational&quot; fare in recent years,
it does not appear that an expansion of federal power over television
is warranted.
<p>
More importantly, there are serious First Amendment problems with
any attempt by government to mandate specific programming content.
<p>
<center><h3>BACKGROUND</h3></center>
<p>
In 1989, a U.S. Senate report found that there was &quot;disturbingly
little&quot; programming &quot;that serves the special needs of
children&quot; and that time periods in which children were most
likely to be watching were filled with &quot;reruns of adult or
family comedy, variety, or dramatic programs.&quot;[1] Several cartoon
shows, whose main characters were heavily marketed as toys (such
as G.I. Joe) were criticized by public interest groups as being
little more than show-length toy commercials. Pressure groups
such as Action for Children's Television lobbied hard for some
federal oversight. They found a sympathetic ear in Sen. Daniel
Inouye (D-Hawaii), who sponsored the Senate version of the Children's
Television Act (CTA).
<p>
In 1990, Congress passed the CTA &quot;to increase the amount
of educational and informational broadcast television programming
available to children and to protect children from over-commercialization
of programming.&quot;[2] It was signed into law by President George
Bush.
<p>
The Act limits advertising spots to 10.5 minutes per hour during
weekends and 12 minutes per hour during weekdays.[3] It also prohibits
the advertising of program-based products on the same shows. For
instance, the <I>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</I> show cannot
include ads for Power Ranger dolls. The Act also directs the FCC
to review, at license renewal time, whether broadcasters have
served the &quot;educational and informational needs of children.&quot;
<p>
In 1991, the FCC issued rules and policies implementing the Children's
Television Act. Television station licensees were required to
respond to the &quot;educational and informational needs of children
16 years of age and under.&quot; No program quotas were established,
and the FCC said it would take into consideration any programming
that served children's &quot;positive development in any way,
including serving their cognitive/intellectual or social/emotional
needs.&quot;[4]
<p>
Irked by some broadcasters' insistence that shows like <I>The
Flintstones, Leave it to Beaver,</I> and <I>The Jetsons</I> meet
the definition of &quot;educational and informational,&quot; the
FCC concluded in a 1993 report that, &quot;We do not believe that
the level of performance is, in the long term, consistent with
the objectives underlying the CTA.&quot;[5]
<p>
Pressure from a coalition of interest groups including the Center
for Media Education, the National Education Association, the National
PTA and others resulted in a renewed effort by the FCC to further
refine the implementation rules for CTA. The coalition proposes
that broadcast licensees be required to provide at least one hour
a day of &quot;educational&quot; children's programming, to be
determined with tougher FCC standards.
<p>
In June 1995, a hearing was held before the full Commission, attended
by broadcasters, interest groups and media. The FCC also asked
for public comment to be submitted in writing, with final comments
and replies being closed on November 20, 1995. More than 600 entries
were filed, from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, private
citizens, TV networks, program providers such as Walt Disney Company,
and many religious and interest groups such as the United Church
of Christ, U.S. Catholic Conference, and the Children's Defense
Fund.[6] Most commentators backed some sort of tightening of the
rules, but the networks and several others argued hard against
program quotas, citing the First Amendment.
<p>
In October 1995, Professor Dale Kunkel of the University of California,
Santa Barbara, released a survey that says some TV stations are
meeting the &quot;kidvid&quot; requirement by airing programs
such as <I>Biker Mice from Mars, America's Funniest Home Videos</I>,
and <I>Yogi Bear</I>.&quot;[7]
<p>
In an Oct. 18, 1995 speech before the National Press Club, FCC
Chairman Reed Hundt cited the Kunkel study, and took particular
aim at NBC's claim that <I>NBA Inside Stuff</I> was educational. 
NBC lawyer Rick Cotton responded that the show
&quot;uses sports to attract teenagers to a program, and then
we provide educational and informational material. This highlights
the problem of government trying to set itself up as the arbiter
of what is educational.&quot;[8]
<p>
<center><h3>THE CASE FOR STATE INTERVENTION ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN</h3></center>
<p>
As noted in the FCC brief filed by the United States Catholic
Conference, &quot;The Supreme Court has not required scientific
exactitude when legislative and administrative bodies take actions
helpful to children and their parents. The Court has deferred
to the judgments of legislators and administrators when harm to
children is at issue.&quot;
<p>
The USCC cites a number of cases in which the court has upheld
state action &quot;aimed at protecting the physical and emotional
well-being of youth.&quot;[9]
<p>
True enough. If public officials depended only on scientific research,
then there would be a pressing need for studies to show that placing
a small child in heavy traffic is dangerous. Some truths are self-evident,
and the general concept of protecting children has been an accepted
societal value in the United States since before its founding.
The only question is how to balance the legitimate public interest
in protecting children with other rights, such as the freedom
of speech, and parental authority. Over the years, the courts
have approved government abridgments of the freedom of speech
when it was determined that children would be unduly harmed without
benefit of such law. Most recently, a federal appeals court in
Washington, D.C. upheld the FCC's right to prohibit indecent programming
between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., citing the government's
&quot;compelling interest&quot; in protecting children.[10]
<p>
But shielding children from pornography, excessive violence and
coarse language is different from legislating prescriptive programming.
It is one thing to put a health warning label on a pack of cigarettes,
for instance, and another to require all citizens to take vitamins.
Similarly, it is one thing to shield children from smut and another
to require specific broadcasting content determined by government.
<p>
In tackling this thorny issue, the FCC has been lobbied to tighten
the requirements on broadcasters to air &quot;educational&quot;
programs. Here is a closer look at what is proposed.
<p>
<center><h3>DEFINING A MORE &quot;PARTICULARIZED&quot; EDUCATIONAL
AND INFORMATIONAL CONTENT</h3></center>
<p>
Currently, the FCC has broad discretion in defining what is good
TV fare for children. Stations can cite anything aired as part
of their repertoire of child-friendly programming. In 1990, Sen. Daniel 
Inouye provided this definition to convey the intent of Congress:
<p>
&quot;Educational and informational needs encompass not only intellectual
development, but also the child's emotional and social development.
Pro-social programming which assists children to discover more
about themselves, their families, and the world would qualify.&quot;[11]
<p>
The danger in adopting a more refined definition is that it may
lead to a one-size-fits-all, government-designated type of children's
programming. Given the ability of ideologues of various stripes
to commandeer government power to their advantage, expanding the
FCC's power in this way may lead to politically correct programming.
Religious programs might be considered either unimportant or even
detrimental, depending on who is doing the assessment and whose
agenda is being served. As government power grows, religion is
pushed out of the public square by those who expansively interpret
the &quot;wall of separation&quot; between church and state. Also,
concern for &quot;diversity&quot; of lifestyle might weigh more
heavily with the FCC than imagination and dramatic content.
<p>
For example, the Public Broadcasting Service outlet in Akron,
Ohio, aired the one-hour homosexual propaganda show <I>What If
I'm Gay?</I> between <I>Kidsongs TV</I> and <I>Sesame Street</I>,
from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. one Thursday in July 1994.[12] Someone thought
this was suitable educational fare for a preschool audience.
<p>
Appointing an academic panel to come up with suitable definitions,
which some FCC observers have proposed, is also fraught with peril,
since academia has proved to be at least as susceptible as government
bureaucrats to the virus of political correctness. And the networks are not 
immune to the same cultural forces. Turner Broadcasting's <I>Captain Planet</I> 
is often cited as an example of responsible privately-generated programming 
for children, but the show also has been severely criticized by some observers 
for its allegedly radical environmentalist themes.
<p>
<center><h3>QUOTAS FOR EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION</h3></center>
<p>
Any government regulation that forces privately owned broadcasters
to air specified content risks violating the First Amendment guarantee
against forced speech of any kind.
<p>
Courts consistently have allowed only the narrowest exceptions
to this rule. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that any government
content rules must be &quot;narrowly tailored to further a substantial
government interest.&quot;[13]
<p>
The U.S. Supreme Court in 1973 upheld the FCC's refusal to force
broadcasters to carry editorial advertisements, saying that such
a move runs &quot;the risk of an enlargement of Government control
over the content of broadcast discussion of public issues.&quot;[14]
In 1974, the Supreme Court upheld the right of a newspaper not
to have to publish government-dictated copy.[15] And in 1986, the
Supreme Court reiterated that &quot;what to say and what to leave
unsaid&quot;[16] were both protected by the First Amendment's prohibition
against &quot;abridging the freedom of speech.&quot;
<p>
In Turner Broadcasting Systems v. FCC (1994), which concerned
whether cable systems could be compelled to carry broadcast signals,
the U.S. Supreme Court said of the FCC that &quot;oversight responsibilities
do not grant it power to ordain any particular type of programming
that must be offered by broadcast stations.&quot;[17]
<p>
The FCC itself has never adopted specific prescriptions of programming,
and has formally rejected such proposals on two occasions.
<p>
Apart from the constitutional question, the FCC would have to
justify such a major government intrusion by proving that 1) there
is an indisputable need for such programming; 2) such programming
does not exist already or 3) children do not have reasonable access
to such programming if it does exist.
<p>
There is very little independent data to indicate that children
are better off watching television -- even &quot;educational&quot;
TV -- than playing, reading or engaging in other activities. In
fact, the drumbeat for &quot;educational&quot; television is part
of a larger lobbying effort in behalf of the concept of early
childhood education. The current, number-one education goal of
the Clinton Administration is that every child &quot;come to school
ready to learn.&quot;
<p>
Declining literacy rates and school test scores have persuaded
some educators to target preschoolers for education, despite the
fact that the presumed benefits of early introduction to formal
learning lack a solid base of research. Just as the supporters
of Head Start have justified its efficacy repeatedly over the
years by reference to a single, nonrepresentative study of 52
preschoolers in a private day-care setting,[18] the educational TV
lobby has based its case for early formal learning on studies
that raise questions of bias.
<p>
In its FCC brief, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting cites
a &quot;1995 report released by Children's Television Workshop&quot;
revealing that &quot;viewing educational television, including
Sesame Street, helps preschoolers in three ways: they are better
prepared to enter school; they perform better on verbal and math
tests as late as age 7; and they spend more time reading.&quot;
Children's Television Workshop produces <I>Sesame Street</I> and
other public TV children's programs. Other data cited by CPB (from
a study commissioned by CPB) indicates that &quot;88 percent of
all preschoolers and 80 percent of all kindergartners watch at
least one of four public broadcasting programs each week -- <I>Sesame
Street, Reading Rainbow, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</I> and <I>Barney
and Friends</I>.&quot;[19]
<p>
If this is so, then the question must be asked: If PBS educational
television has made such a difference, why have test scores continued
to decline? According to <I>Ready to Learn</I>, a 1991 report
by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, increasing
numbers of pupils are deficient in language skills. Why do children
seem less prepared? Could it be that children have become so addicted
to television that they have difficulty concentrating on real
school work? Could it be that a steady diet of television reduces
a child's attention span more than it educates?
<p>
PBS defenders often cite studies by the Educational Testing Service,
sponsored by Children's Television Workshop, that report significant
gains among young viewers in a number of basic skills such as
counting and naming letters and numbers. A later Russell Sage
Foundation review of the data concluded that the gains were more
modest and that they could be attributed to other factors inherent
in the research method. Also, the Sage study found that the show
increased the intellectual gap between middle-class and poor children,
the opposite of ETA's findings.[20]
<p>
Something of a national sacred cow, <I>Sesame Street</I> is loved
by children and adults alike. Its production values have always
been high, and the content is witty and funny. Big Bird, Bert
and Ernie and other characters have become national icons.
<p>
Touted since its inception as an educational device, the show
is high-quality enter-tainment that parents often will watch with
their children. However, the &quot;educational&quot; effects,
some critics argue, may have been exaggerated to garner public
funding and to alleviate the guilt of parents who let <I>Sesame
Street</I> baby-sit their toddlers for hours on end.
<p>
One <I>Sesame Street</I> critic, Kay S. Hymowitz, even questions
the show's central premise -- that it is good for children. Writing
in the public policy periodical <I>City Journal</I>, Hymowitz
notes that for all its touted &quot;diversity,&quot; <I>Sesame
Street</I> &quot;couldn't be more monocultural and conformist
in its unwavering endorsement of American anti-intellectualism
and [the] cult of the cool.&quot;[21] Hymowitz explains that the skits
trivialize great literature and great events by making them conform
to whatever is current in popular culture, particularly television
shows. She also detects a drumbeat that kids must be &quot;cool&quot;
about everything. Encouraging children to adopt a skeptical approach
to life teaches the &quot;folly&quot; of being passionate about
anything. This can have the side effect of encouraging children
to detach from the beliefs of their parents.
<p>
Hymowitz also notes that <I>Sesame Street</I> &quot;focuses on
mere technical skills, the tools of mental cultivation, rather
than mental cultivation itself; the building blocks of thought
rather than thought....Worse, the show's anti-intellectualism
and its glorification of television culture over print send the
implicit message that the skills of literacy have no meaningful
purpose.&quot;
<p>
Aware that she may come off as something of an Oscar the Grouch,
Hymowitz acknowledges the show's appeal (&quot;who can resist
the clever witticisms of sophisticated television?&quot;) but
stresses that her main concern is the impression that <I>Sesame
Street</I> is an unalloyed educational bonanza.
<p>
No matter how educational <I>Sesame Street</I> appears to be,
if its net effect has been to make school seem dull by comparison,
and to help shorten youngsters' attention spans, then it may not
be such a good idea to promote television viewing of any type
for children. The most powerful argument, outside CTW's own studies,
is that children &quot;are going to watch TV anyway,&quot; which
has some resonance, given the overwhelming evidence that children
do spend many hours in front of the tube.
<p>
Finally, considering the enormous amount of &quot;educational&quot;
programming provided by public television[22] (PBS regularly airs
such popular shows as <I>Sesame Street, Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood,
Barney and Friends, Where in the World Is Carmen San Diego?, Ghostwriter,
Puzzleplace, Shining Time Station</I> and <I>Reading Rainbow)</I>
and the fact that most American children are already tuning into
these shows in large numbers, and the fact that the networks have
increased their &quot;educational&quot; output significantly in
recent years,[23] proponents would be hard pressed to prove that children
have so little access to &quot;educational&quot; television that
an unprecedented government intrusion into content is warranted.
<p>
CTA sponsor Sen. Daniel Inouye noted during debate over passage
of the bill in 1990 that the total programming mix should be &quot;left
to the discretion of the broadcaster, taking into account what
other stations, including non-commercial ones, are doing in this
important area.&quot;[24]
<p>
<center><h3>PROGRAM SPONSORSHIP OPTION</h3></center>
<p>
Public television has nearly monopolized weekly children's programming.
The FCC is considering allowing commercial stations to subsidize
such programming on other channels (such as PBS) as a way to satisfy
their overall duty to serve children's needs. This proposal has
support primarily from the public broadcasting community. In its
FCC brief, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting notes that:
&quot;With CPB at the helm, public television has embraced the
education of America's youth as its core mission for over 25 years.&quot;[25]
CPB promotes the concept of the &quot;program sponsorship&quot;
option in which broadcast licensees would meet a prescribed quota
of children's programming by airing it or by providing &quot;financial
or in-kind support&quot; to &quot;host&quot; stations in the same
market.
<p>
CPB notes that this would result in &quot;shifting programming
dollars to the broadcasters with the greatest expertise in and
commitment to children's educational programming -- the noncommercial
educational broadcasters.&quot;[26]
<p>
CPB also suggests that stations should not be allowed to satisfy
all of the requirement this way, and should provide at least some
educational broadcasts of their own, citing Sen. Inouye's wish
that the FCC &quot;would, of course, expect that each station
will itself broadcast some programming specifically designed for
children to serve their educational and informational needs.&quot;[27]
<p>
Several critics have charged that the formula amounts to a guaranteed
subsidy to Children's Television Workshop, among others. Dr. Laurence
Jarvik of the Center for the Study of Popular Culture calls the
idea &quot;a shakedown by PBS, pure and simple. You might as well
have Big Bird put a gun to their head.&quot;[28]
<p>
Peggy Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television, also
opposes the sponsorship option: &quot;PBS serves the needs of
children now. Allowing stations to simply pay another station
to do programming does not fulfill stations' obligations to serve
the needs of children.&quot;[29]
<p>
Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Media Education,
which lobbies for the new FCC requirements, nonetheless also opposes
the sponsorship option: &quot;The intent of the law was for every
station to air a significant amount of programming for children.&quot;[30]
<p>
Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), who, as chairman of the House telecommunications
subcommittee played an important role in passing the CTA, said
in an interview that &quot;the intent of the Act was not to have
stations pay PBS to do their programming for them.&quot;[31]
<p>
<center><h3>ADOPTING LICENSING RENEWAL &quot;PROCESSING GUIDELINES&quot;
</h3></center>
<p>
Processing guidelines would designate how much &quot;educational
or informational&quot; material had to be included for a licensee
to qualify under any new definitions. They would be the &quot;teeth&quot;
for the FCC to withhold license renewal based on compliance. As
such, they would constitute the equivalent of program quotas,
which would be an infringement of broadcasters' First Amendment
rights.
<p>
<center><h3>RESTRICTING CREDIT FOR &quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot; FARE
TO &quot;CORE,&quot; STANDARD-LENGTH PROGRAMMING ONLY</h3></center>
<p>
In an attempt to ensure regularity of wholesome content, proponents
suggest that broadcast licensees not be able to include specials
and short subjects when they make their case to the FCC that they
have served the &quot;educational and informational&quot; needs
of children. They recommend that only regularly scheduled, 
&quot;standard-length&quot; programs (at least a half-hour in length) be 
counted.
<p>
While the intent seems reasonable, the formula would discourage
imaginative public service announcements generated by the ad industry
and by interest groups. It may also discourage sponsorship of
TV specials.
<p>
The Walt Disney Company, which produces all manner of children's
programming, argued in its FCC brief for the value of non-regular
programming:
<p>
&quot;Certain lessons, for example, can be conveyed best in a
short segment, but might become overbearing or pedantic if relegated
to a 15- or 30-minute format. Anyone who can recall the impact
of the anti-drug commercial depicting a man breaking an egg into
a frying pan and watching it sizzle with the voice-over, 'This
is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. Any questions?,' knows
the unique educational value that such programming can have.&quot;[32]
<p>
<I>Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue</I>, described by NBC as &quot;a
history-making animated anti-substance abuse television special
for children,&quot; was broadcast on all major TV networks and
&quot;hundreds of independent stations and cable outlets throughout
the U.S.&quot;[33] ABC airs the Schoolhouse Rock series during its Saturday 
morning lineup. The animated, three-minute segments are set to music and
have featured such topics as multiplication tables (<I>Zero Is
My Hero</I>), grammar (<I>Conjunction Junction</I>), history (<I>Preamble
to the Constitution</I>), and science (<I>Electricity</I>).[34]
<p>
The Senate Report on the Children's Television Act of 1990 emphasizes
an &quot;overall&quot; assessment of programming to children,
and specifies that the requirement &quot;does not exclude any
programming that does in fact serve the informational and educational
needs of children.&quot;[35]
<p>
An alternative to a ban on counting other than &quot;core&quot;
programs might be for the FCC merely to state that it encourages
more regularly scheduled programming for children as part of a
good-faith effort by broadcasters. Licensees could then score
points by offering more &quot;core&quot; shows, but be able to
present significant short-subject spots as additional proof of
commitment to children's needs. Again, this is contingent upon
acceptance of an increase in the FCC's power over children's programming.
<p>
<center><h3>REQUIRING ON-AIR DESIGNATIONS OF PROGRAMS AS 
&quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot;</h3></center>
<p>
Children are drawn to particular television shows for their entertainment
value. Parents may be far more interested in a show's educational
content. An on-air designation might seem to be a valuable tool
for parents, but it risks the same problems as posed by specific
content regulation. Educational designations could be granted
or withheld arbitrarily or for ideological reasons. The designations
could also have the unintended effect of &quot;warning&quot; children
that &quot;somebody thinks this is good for you, so prepare to
be bored.&quot; Good, entertaining educational fare could wind
up being stigmatized.
<p>
The idea has other problems. As Disney points out, &quot;requiring
an on-air identification attached to a particular program will
serve no such benefit unless the parent is not only watching television
but also watching the particular channel at the moment the identification
is aired.&quot;[36]
<p>
A system to determine such designations would artificially divide
the world of programming into the &quot;educational&quot; and
the &quot;uneducational.&quot; Since the definition of &quot;educational&quot;
is so subjective, and programming does not lend itself to such
draconian division, the system would be unworkable. It is a simple
task to affix warning labels because of specific content, such
as sex, violence or vulgar language, which can be quantified.
But it is another to determine an entire program's subjective
worth as an educational device.
<p>
A reasonable alternative might be to encourage the provision of
published guides on TV content and program guides for parents.
But again, this should not be required.
<p>
<center><h3>DEFINING AS &quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot; THOSE PROGRAMS
FOR WHICH EDUCATIONAL CONTENT IS A &quot;SIGNIFICANT&quot;
PART OF THE SHOW</h3></center>
<p>
When the FCC first proposed new rules for children's TV, the agency
suggested that education must be the &quot;primary&quot; purpose
of educational programs. Now, it has shifted to the stance that
education be a &quot;significant&quot; purpose. This was a reasonable
accommodation, given the power of entertainment to attract viewers.
<p>
<I>Bill Nye the Science Guy</I> is a Disney-produced weekly program
that teaches children about scientific wonders using graphics,
special effects, music video-type sound and comedy.
<p>
&quot;Someone recently asked me to break down into percentages
the entertainment and educational components of our show,&quot;
Nye told an interviewer. &quot;Quite honestly, I couldn't do it.
But I am 100 percent certain that the program is more than 50
percent entertainment -- or kids wouldn't watch.&quot;[37]
<p>
The jury is out as to what exactly is educational fare. Jarvik
notes that even shows such as the Fox cartoon comedy <I>The Simpsons</I>
should not be dismissed as lacking educational content. &quot;While
I don't approve of a foul-mouthed brat, at the least, children
see a family with a father and mother. I suspect that some of
those who disapprove of <I>The Simpsons</I> dislike the idea of
kids seeing an intact, traditional family, and would rather replace
it with something like a cartoon television version of <I>Heather
Has Two Mommies</I>.&quot;[38]
<p>
Moreover, much of the television that children watch is not geared
specifically for them but may, in fact, be educational. What do
children derive from seeing re-runs of <I>The Waltons</I>, for
instance? The hour-long show, in syndication, features a wholesome
Virginia family working out its problems during the Depression.
While not being specifically &quot;educational,&quot; the show
conceivably conveys more valuable information about life to children
than a designated &quot;educational&quot; program.
<p>
<center><h3>EXCLUDING FOR CREDIT ANY PROGRAMS THAT AIR BEFORE 7 A.M. AND
AFTER 10 P.M.</h3></center>
<p>
Proponents of this provision charge that TV stations are airing
some &quot;educational&quot; programs when no one is watching,
in the early hours of the morning, for instance. They want a 7
a.m. standard so that more children would be exposed to educational
content.
<p>
In many markets, public television provides <I>Sesame Street</I>
and other children's shows beginning at 6 a.m. and running throughout
the morning. TV ratings data, as noted in a July 1995 opinion
of the federal D.C. Court of Appeals, show that many children
are viewing television between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., and even later
into the evening.[39] The Nielsen Company has found that an estimated
1.5 million children aged two to 11, or five percent of all children,
watch TV Monday through Friday at 6 a.m and that an estimated
2.4 million children aged two to 11 (6.3 percent) tune in by 6:30
a.m.[40] Rule proponents contend that this is too small a proportion
of child viewers to make enough difference.
<p>
The networks contend that most educational programming takes place
after 7 a.m. anyway. A study by the National Association of Broadcasters
says that during fall 1994, some 81.4 percent of programs identified
by licensees as &quot;educational and informational&quot; were
broadcast after 7 a.m, with 15.8 percent being aired before 7
a.m.[41] NBC, in its FCC brief, suggests that the FCC give credit
with no time limit, but &quot;if the Commission nonetheless feels
compelled to take some action to allay its concerns in this regard,
we believe it should simply state that licensees must broadcast
some qualifying standard-length programming after 7 a.m. and that
licensees meeting this standard will receive full credit for all
their qualifying programming broadcast during the hours of 6 a.m.
to 11 p.m.&quot;
<p>
Limiting credit to educational fare after 7 a.m. might eliminate
some licensees' obvious dodges, such as scheduling a teen educational
program at 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, when most teens are still
asleep. But it might have an unintended effect of discouraging
<I>any</I> educational programming between 6 a.m .and 7 a.m.,
when up to two million children are watching. Perhaps the FCC
should consider counting as educational fare during those hours
only those programs that appeal to the prime audience during that
time -- small children.
<p>
<center><h3>MONITORING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING OVER
A SPECIFIC TIME PERIOD</h3></center>
<p>
One of the more arguably valuable functions of government is data
collecting, since this can shed light on a problem. It can also
create issues, and data can be (and frequently is) manipulated
for partisan ends. But at least the government must give everybody
access to the data.
<p>
Outside of the census, there is no constitutional provision for
federal agencies to collect data. The best argument that can be
made is that data collection helps bureaucrats and lawmakers do
their job better, so it adds to the &quot;general welfare.&quot;
<p>
Should the FCC decide to do anything with regard to children's
television, the agency is on the safest grounds in collecting
data on programming. But the enterprise is open to abuse, such
as widely-varying definitions of what constitutes &quot;educational
and informative&quot; programming for children. This brings us
back to the central problem: Is the federal government legally
and practically suited to the task of fine-tuning children's television?
The honest answer is no.
<p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
More federal control of children's television programming is not
in the best interests of children and their parents and would
constitute an unwarranted violation of the First Amendment rights
of broadcasters. Children learn in many ways, and government-dictated
designation of some material as &quot;educational&quot; may lead
to politically-correct programming and more government control
of the dissemination of information. The FCC should reject the
proposed rules.

Kemp, a long-time champion of supply-side economics and "empowerment" strategies to help the poor, served as Housing and Urban Development Secretary during the Bush administration. A former nine-term congressman representing Buffalo, N.Y., Kemp was a 1988 candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.

<p>
Mr. Kemp resigned from The Heritage Foundation on August 14, 1996, to pursue the office of Vice-President of the United States.<p>

<P><TT><B><A NAME="1">1</A></B></TT>	The 2.9 percent Medicare tax, as
explained above, applies to all income. The 12.4  percent Social Security tax,
however, applies only  to the first $61,600 of income (the reason being that
Social Security is somewhat akin to  an insurance premium; taxing additional
income would have the effect of boosting the  retirement benefits of those who
had higher  incomes during their working years).
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="2">2</A></B></TT>	This section is derived largely 
(though updated) from Robert Rector, &quot;How to  Strengthen America's
Crumbling Families,&quot; Heritage  Foundation <CITE><U>Backgrounder</U></CITE>
No. 894, April 28, 1992.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="3">3</A></B></TT>	Liberal and conservative economists 
agree that both shares of the Social Security tax  are in fact taxes on workers'
wages. See Joseph A. Pechman and Benjamin A. Okner, 
<U><CITE>Who Bears the Tax Burden?</CITE></U>  (Washington, D.C.: The 
Brookings Institution, 1974), pp. 2543.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="4">4</A></B></TT>	Data from the U.S. Bureau of the 
Census. Total pretax income includes the employer  share of Social Security tax
deducted from the  worker's wages. In this case, the median income for  a family
of four in 1994 is $47,012. Adding $3,596 from the employer's share of payroll 
taxes brings the gross family income to $56,608.

Board of  Trustees of the Federal OldAge and Survivors Insurance and Disability
Insurance Trust  Funds</CITE></U>, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  April 12, 1994.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="6">6</A></B></TT>	This is not to suggest that 
politicians should be given power to invest the funds.  Such a policy inevitably
would result in political manipulation, as surplus funds would be  steered to
politically wellconnected industries  and used to bail out businesses in the
states and districts of senior lawmakers.  A governmentcontrolled retirement
system, by definition, must be operated on a  payasyougo basis.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="7">7</A></B></TT> The chart shows a decline in tax 
collections in the early 1980s, but this occurred  as a result of the 19811982
recession (which started, incidentally, before Reagan's  first fiscal year
began). Moreover, this decline  in revenue also took place before there was a
tax cut. The Reagan economic package was  approved in the summer of 1981, but
the tax cut  was phased in over several years and not fully implemented until
1985. The tax burden  actually rose in Reagan's first year in office, as the
minor tax cut in 1981 was overwhelmed  by previously legislated payroll tax
increases and inflationinduced bracket creep  (indexing to protect taxpayers
from inflation did not  go into effect until 1985). The 1982 portion of the tax
cut was more significant, but it  was roughly canceled out by bracket creep and
payroll tax changes.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="8">8</A></B></TT>	The Administration's $300perchild 
credit begins phasing out for families with  incomes above $60,000 and reaches
zero at $75,000  in family income. The credit increases in value to $500 per
child after 1998.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="9">9</A></B></TT>	For taxpayers filing jointly with 
incomes above $110,000, the credit phases out at a  rate of $25 for each $1,000
above the threshold (a range of $20,000), thus fully phasing out  at $130,000 in
income. For families with two children, the two credits are phased out fully  at
$150,000 in income. For single filers, the credit begins to phase out at $75,000
in  income.

be defined properly. Provisions which force taxpayers to overstate their income,

repealed. Nor should taxpayers be forced to  undercount business expenses. As a

delaying, reducing, or canceling wage increases. In  most years, additional

increases are accompanied by higher taxes, however,  it is government, not the
workers, that captures all the benefits.

<p> 
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Last winter's budget battle between Congress and the President was seen by most observers as a victory for the President and a defeat for fiscal conservatives in Congress who were attempting to make major reductions and reforms in government spending programs. But when the smoke cleared and the fiscal year (FY) 1996 budget process finally came to a close, it was apparent that while a rhetorical battle was lost, the budget war was won by the fiscal conservatives. And the victory was unprecedented in scope.

How complete was the victory?  The 104th Congress:<ul>

<p><li>Reduced year-over-year discretionary spending for the first time since 1969.

<p><li>Reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices between 1994 and 1996.<sup>1</sup>

<p><li>Eliminated over 270 programs, agencies, offices, and projects.

<p><li>Helped reduce the deficit to the lowest level in 14 years. Only President Reagan's FY 1982 budget deficit was lower.

<p><li>Enacted into law more privatizations in just one year than occurred during the entire eight years of the Reagan Administration.

<p><li>Forced a national debate on structural welfare reform and encouraged states to continue to overhaul their welfare systems. Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent-- reducing the demand for federal as well as state dollars. The 104th Congress included as part of welfare reform legislation much of the Wisconsin plan. Unfortunately, President Clinton chose to veto the bill.

<p><li>Deregulated the agriculture and telecommunications industries. Congress passed a 1996 farm bill that begins to bring an end to costly Depression-era agriculture programs by getting government out of the business of telling farmers what to grow. This was the most sweeping reform in 60 years. Farmers increasingly will be able to grow to meet the demands of the market rather than the federal government. In addition, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 eliminates decades worth of outdated rules and restrictions on the telephone, cable, and broadcast industries. It will expand job and export opportunities within the industry, lower the cost of basic communications services, and free consumers to choose between competing providers of service.</ul><p>



<b>WHAT BUDGET DEFEAT?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although many in Congress have come to believe that they lost the budget war, the facts indicate otherwise. As the final FY 1996 budget reveals, this Congress accomplished an unprecedented reduction and elimination of unneeded federal programs, federal bureaucrats, and federal spending. To be sure, Congress did not close any of the four Cabinet departments -- Commerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development -- it targeted. Nor did it see its ambitious national reforms in welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare signed into law. But the hundreds of reforms it did accomplish were comprehensive and far-reaching. Indeed, many of its accomplishments were far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan Administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In the discretionary budget accounts alone, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969 as a result of program terminations and major cuts. More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. These include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts, the Office of Technology Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Bureau of Mines, the Administrative Conference of the United States, and hundreds of other programs throughout the government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	And whereas Congress fell short in its efforts to terminate such targeted programs as the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Legal Services Corporation, it cut their budgets substantially and forced them to curtail activities. Indeed, even by early Reagan-era standards, the reforms are unprecedented. Examples:<ul>

<p><li>The first Reagan budget proposed to cut the National Endowment for the Arts by 27 percent, but achieved a 17 percent reduction. This Congress cut the Endowment by 38 percent. 

<p><li>Reagan wanted the National Endowment for the Humanities cut by 23 percent in his first budget, but achieved 20 percent. This Congress cut it by 36 percent.

<p><li>Reagan proposed to cut mass transit subsidies by 10 percent; this Congress cut them by 43 percent.

<p><li>Congress cut the Appalachian Regional Commission by 39 percent and the Legal Services Corporation by 33 percent. Both agencies were slated for termination by the Reagan Administration and by this Congress, but both survived, albeit with significant reductions in funding. 

<p><li>HUD's budget was cut by $2.6 billion -- or by 10 percent compared with spending for the previous year. 

<p><li>Both this Congress and the Reagan Administration failed in their plans to eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which once again demonstrated its impressive skills at self-preservation, but this Congress made a real and deep cut. Reagan proposed a 25 percent cut, but CPB's budget rose $10 million in his first year. This Congress substantially reduced CPB's spending last year through the rescission process, cutting planned spending by $37 million in 1996 and $55 million in 1997.</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


As a result of these and hundreds of other cuts, freezes, and terminations, this year's budget deficit is expected to total $146.3 billion, in contrast to the $193.8 billion expected for this year by President Clinton as part of his budget plan in 1993, and the $196 billion projected in the FY 1996 baseline. Importantly, three-quarters of this deficit improvement is due to the spending reductions enacted by the 104th Congress. As noted earlier, FY 1996's projected deficit will be the lowest since President Reagan's FY 1982 budget.
<p>

<b>HOW CLINTON HAS TRIED TO STOP ENTITLEMENT REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Obviously, the deficit would have been much lower had Congress been as successful with the federal entitlement programs as it was with the discretionary spending accounts. Unfortunately, multiple vetoes by the President of repeated congressional efforts to enact reforms in major entitlement programs like welfare, Medicare, and Medicaid have left federal spending higher than it could have been and rendered future reform efforts more difficult.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But in welfare, at least, the congressional emphasis on welfare reform, including its passage by the House as part of the Contract with America, has encouraged many states to press the White House for waivers of current rules to enable these states to reform their welfare systems along the lines proposed by the House and Senate. President Clinton, fortunately, has agreed to many of these waiver requests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	As a result of these reforms, and despite the lackluster national economy, the number of Americans on welfare has fallen by 1.3 million between 1993 and the present, for an overall decline of 9 percent. <sup>2</sup> Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent.Unfortunately, President Clinton has blocked the rapid expansion of successful state programs like Wisconsin's to the rest of the nation by vetoing federal welfare reform legislation that would have removed the need for cumbersome waiver requests.
<p>

<b>PRIVATIZATION FINALLY MOVES FORWARD</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Perhaps in no other area was the difference between past and present performance as dramatic as it was in the 104th Congress's success in privatizing government-run enterprises. Spurred forward by the House Speaker's appointment of Representative Scott Klug (R-WI) to head up the House's privatization effort, numerous privatizations have been successfully concluded, often with bipartisan support and White House cooperation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The Reagan Administration was able to privatize only Conrail and the National Consumer Cooperative Bank, because of intense congressional opposition during the 1980s. But in one year, this Congress has enacted legislation to privatize four major government programs. Although first proposed and developed in the mid-1980s by the Reagan Administration, it took this Congress to pass the legislation (which the President signed into law) to privatize the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, the Naval Petroleum Reserve, and the Alaska Power Marketing Administration. Passed by the House and awaiting action in the Senate is legislation to privatize the government's National Helium Reserve in Texas. Although final transfer prices remain to be determined, the estimated revenues to the federal treasury from these four sales will be several billion dollars.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In addition to these asset sales, this Congress has initiated many contracting out opportunities which will allow the government to provide better services at lower costs. During the first session, for example, Congress enacted legislation to contract out the Internal Revenue Service's debt collection efforts, the General Services Administration's commercial real estate brokerage functions, the special forecasting functions of the National Weather Service, and selective map-making functions throughout the federal establishment.

	Perhaps encouraged by the more favorable privatization environment in Congress, the Clinton Administration dusted off and improved a Reagan Administration proposal -- called Fed Co-Op -- to set in motion an employee buyout of the background investigations functions previously provided by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.<sup>3</sup>  Involving approximately 700 federal employees, and structured as an employee stock ownership plan with a projected 90 percent employee ownership share, the transfer is scheduled to take place in mid-July. Unfortunately, there are concerns that some House lawmakers may attempt to thwart it in an effort to preserve the civil service status    quo.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	More generally, Congress included in this year's defense authorization bill (Section 357 of P.L. 104-106) language that mandates a more systematic appraisal of contracting opportunities within the Department of Defense (DOD). Although Defense has been one of the few government agencies to take advantage of contracting opportunities, much more could be done. DOD estimates that its cost savings through contracting have averaged 31 percent on contract competitions between 1978 and 1994, and that the savings now total nearly $1.5 billion per year. <sup>4</sup> 
<p>

<b>OTHER POLICY CHANGES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Both the telcommunications and agriculture sectors of the economy were the targets of significant legislative reforms that will place more responsibility and decision making in the hands of private participants operating in the competitive marketplace. And just getting underway in Congress are a series of efforts to overhaul the federal government's involvement in virtually all facets of America's national and local transportation systems. Perhaps indicative of the shape this effort will ultimately take are some innovative pieces of legislation that have been or soon will be introduced in Congress. These include prospective legislation that would devolve much of the federal highway program to the states, as well as existing legislation that would privatize the airports, transfer Amtrak responsibilities to regional compacts created by the states, and remove the trouble-plagued Federal Aviation Administration from the Department of Transportation.
<p>

<b>THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 As impressive as this Congress's performance was, it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervades the federal government. As noted earlier, largely untouched were the costly entitlement programs for welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare. These should be revisited during the FY 1997 budget process and should be campaign issues at all levels of government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Furthermore, opportunities for extensive and cost-saving privatization remain, with the four power marketing administrations prime candidates for commercialization and self-sufficiency. Potential revenues to the government from their sale have been estimated at between $8 billion and $20 billion.<sup>5</sup>  Other areas for privatization include all facets of government's role in the transportation sector, including airports, air traffic control, highways, mass transit, and Amtrak. And building on the progress described earlier, Congress and the Administration should be more aggressive in seeking contracting opportunities to improve service at reduced costs. As noted in a Heritage study published last year, budgetary savings of at least $9 billion per year could be achieved through contracting.<sup>6</sup> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	 Finally, and notwithstanding the impressive reforms made in the thousands of discretionary government programs, much more could and should be done. Savings of an additional $20 billion should be the goal of the FY 1997 budget. As a casual reading of the hundreds of reports produced by the government's Inspectors General reveals, waste and mismanagement are still pervasive throughout the federal establishment and have largely survived the first round of budget cuts. Indeed, there is recent evidence to suggest that in response to budget cuts, government bureaucracies have engaged in the traditional "Washington Monument" ploy -- cut services to the public instead of making efficiencies in program overhead.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	For example, the National Park Service has been highly resistant to the use of contractors to provide routine services such as entrance fee collection, janitorial work, and campground management, preferring instead to use more costly uniformed personnel to perform these services. As a result, and in response to limits placed on the growth of its budget, the Park Service has announced a series of service cutbacks in the form of reduced hours and closed campgrounds just as vacation season is getting underway. Such bureaucratic games should not be tolerated by Congress. Lawmakers should require the Park Service to seek savings through management efficiencies rather than service cutbacks. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The record of the last year's budget battle clearly demonstrates that, although the tactical victory may belong to the President, the strategic victory belongs to the 104th Congress. Many of its members, particulary the freshmen, arrived in Washington with an electoral mandate to cut the budget. It was a mandate they honored, and in doing so they accomplished the first reduction in discretionary spending since 1969.
