<h1> ASIA-LABOUR: Indochina's Children Exploited in Thailand </h1>

<ADDRESS>	By Prangtip Daroueng </ADDRESS>
<strong>BANGKOK, Feb 11 (IPS) - Teary-eyed and grimy faced, they tap on  
car windows on busy streets in the Thai capital begging for money;  
some wait in fear in darkened rooms in Bangkok brothels; others  
work by day night in factories at border areas. </strong><P>
	Some have been smuggled across borders by unscrupulous dealers in  
the child sex trade, others were brought by their parents, and  
still others came on their own, hopeful that fast developing  
Thailand might have more to offer than the poverty they left  
behind. <P>
	Invariably, these unskilled, uneducated children are subjected  
various forms of abuse and exploitation, their plight compounded  
by their illegal status and inability to speak Thai. As such, they  
are unable to even seek the recourse of laws that often even fails  
to protect children of the soil. <P>
	Centrally located in South-east Asia, with porous borders linking  
the impoverished Indochina region, Thailand has long been a hub  
for migrant labour -- legal and illegal -- from southern China,  
Burma and Cambodia. <P>
	More recently however, the faces have become younger, with  
unofficial estimates putting the number of illegal workers under  
the age of 15 at close to 200,000 -- a conservative figure, says  
Taneeya Runcharoen, associate coordinator of the Bangkok-based non- 
governmental organisation (NGO) Child Workers in Asia. <P>
	Child rights campaigners say that minimum wage increases have  
seen Thai industry increasingly turn to cheap foreign labour in a  
bid to remain competitive -- and those easiest exploited are  
children without education or documentation. <P>
	Government, under pressure from the private sector, sanctions the  
import of foreign, skilled labour from its Indochina neighbours.  
This policy, say rights activists, not only fails to curb child  
labour, but exacerbates the problem in that children accompanying  
their parents invariably are also put to work. <P>
	According to the interior ministry, there are 740,000 foreign  
workers employed in Thailand under its import labour scheme with  
Burma, Laos and Cambodia. <P>
	A research study carried out by Thailand's Mahidol University  
estimates that as a direct result of the scheme, 185,000 children  
under 15 years old are involved in one form or another, of illegal  
work activity. <P>
	The situation has been drawn to the government's attention and in  
collaboration with seven NGOs and Bangkok's Chulalongkorn  
University, the interior ministry has set up a working group to  
look into the issue of abuses against foreign children. <P>
	Initial findings show most of the children come from southern  
China, Laos, Burma and Cambodia. <P>
	''From our interviews with some of them, they said that had hoped  
to continue staying in Thailand with their families because the  
situation back home, both economically and, in some cases like  
Burma, politically, are unsure,'' says Taneeya. <P>
	The children can be put into three groups. <P>
	''The first group are those who came with their parents. The  
second group are children who came with friends or relatives of  
similar ages in search of jobs; and the last group are those who  
were cheated by agents and were taken from their villages without  
knowing what they were going to find here,'' says Taneeya. <P>
	The trend is that the foreign children are gradually replacing  
Thai child workers in the agricultural and industrial sectors.  
They are also swelling the number of street children that daily  
beg for money on Bangkok streets. The welfare department says that  
at least 300 foreign children roam the capital. <P>
	This does not mean that Thai children too are not still  
exploited, observes Kempon Wirunrapan, director of the NGO  
Foundation for Children's Development. <P>
	''Although Thai child workers generally know more about the  
situation before they start working, it does not change the  
behaviour of some employers,'' she says. <P>
	Child rights activists say that while the issue needs to be  
better addressed at the national level, the problem is really a  
regional one -- driven by poverty and economic disparities. <P>
	Moreover, child labour -- foreign-based or domestic -- must be  
seen as an issue of abuse of human rights, and so must not be  
dealt with in the same manner as illegal migrant labour. <P>
	''We would like the issue of child rights put on the ASEAN  
agenda,'' says Taneeya. <P>
	ASEAN (Association of South-east Asian Nations) groups Brunei,  
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and  
Vietnam -- that cooperate at the governmental level. Burma, Laos  
and Cambodia are also bidding to become members.

<html><head><title>Women in Islam : Qur'anic ideals versus Muslim realities</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><img align=left hspace=3 src="ippf_pix/ippf_logo.gif"><h3>International<br>Planned<br>Parenthood<br>Federation</h3><i>The material that follows has been provided by <a href="ippf_info.html">IPPF</a></i><br clear=left><hr><h1>Women in Islam : Qur'anic ideals versus Muslim realities</h1><b>by Dr Riffat Hassan</b><p><img align=right hspace=10 src="ippf_pix/ippf_women.gif">In spite of the fact that the Qur'an is particularly solicitous about women's well-being and development, women have been the targets of the most serious violations of human rights which occur in Muslim societies in general.  In particular attention needs to be drawn to the discrepancies which exist between Qur'anic ideals and Muslim practice with regards to the following women and women-related issues. <p><h3>Attitude toward girl-children</h3>Muslim societies tend to discriminate against girl-children from the moment of birth.  It is customary amongst Muslims to regard a son as a gift, and a daughter as a trial, from God. Therefore, the birth of a son is an occasion for celebration while the birth of a daughter calls for commiseration, if not lamentation.  Here, it may be mentioned that though Muslims say with great pride that Islam abolished female infanticide, one of the most common crimes in many Muslim countries is the murder of women by their male relatives.  These so-called "honour-killings" are frequently used to camouflage other kinds of crime. <h3>Marriage</h3>There is much Qur'anic legislation which is aimed at protecting the rights of women in the context of marriage. However, many girls are married when they are still minors and do not understand that marriage in Islam is a contract and that women, as well as men, have the right to negotiate the terms of this contract.  The Qur'anic description of man and woman in marriage: "They are your garments/ And you are their garments", implies closeness, mutuality, and equality. However, Muslim societies in general have never regarded men and women as equal, particularly in the context of marriage. The husband, in fact, is regarded not only as the wife's majazi khuda (god in earthly form) but also as her gateway to heaven or hell and the arbiter of her final destiny.  That such an idea can exist within the framework of Islam which -in theory - considers the deification of any human being as shirk, regarded as the one unforgivable sin by the Qur'an, and rejects the idea that there can be any intermediary between a believer and God, represents both a profound irony and a great tragedy.<h3>Marital problems and divorce</h3>While the Qur'an provides for just arbitration in case a marriage runs into problems, it also makes provision for what we today call a "no-fault" divorce and does not make any adverse judgments about divorce.  The Qur'anic prescription, "Either live together in kindness or separate in kindness" preserves the spirit of amity and justice in the context of both marriage and divorce.  In Muslim societies, however, divorce has been made extremely difficult for women, both legally and through social penalties. <h3>Child-rearing and child-custody</h3>In the context of child-rearing, the Qur'an states clearly that the divorced parents of a minor child must decide by mutual consultation how the child is to be raised and that they must not use the child to exploit each other. However, divorced women in Muslim societies are often subjected to great exploitation on account of their children, losing the right to the custody of both boys (generally at age 7) and girls (generally at age 12).  It is difficult to imagine an act of greater cruelty than depriving a mother of her children simply because she is divorced. <h3>Polygamy</h3>Polygamy was intended by the Qur'an to be for the protection of orphans and widows.  However, in practice it has been widely misused and has been made into the Sword of Damocles which keeps women under constant threat. <h3>Inheritance</h3>One of the most "revolutionary" steps taken by the Qur'an for the empowerment of women was to give women the right of inheritance.  Few women in the world have had this right until the modern period.  According to Qur'anic prescription not only could women inherit on the death of a close relative, they could also receive bequests or gifts during the lifetime of a benevolent caretaker.  However, in general, Muslim societies have disapproved of the idea of giving wealth to a woman in preference to a man, even when she is economically disadvantaged or in need.  The intent of the Qur'anic laws of inheritance was to give all members of a family - including women as daughters, mothers, sisters and wives - a share in the inheritance so that the family-wealth was equitably distributed amongst all the "legal" heirs.  The fact that women - to whom no financial responsibility was ascribed -were given a share, indicates the concern of the Qur'an to give women financial autonomy and security.<p>However, Muslims have used the unequal share of men and women in some (not all) cases, e.g., in the case of a son whose share is twice that of a daughter - to argue that men are worth twice as much as women! A revised reading of the Qur'anic texts relating to inheritance is very important for combating the discriminatory attitude toward women in the context of inheritance which is widely prevalent in Muslim societies.<h3>Segregation and "purdah" or "veiling"</h3>Although the purpose of the Qur'anic legislation dealing with women's dress and conduct was to make it safe for women to go about their daily business - which included the right to engage in gainful activity as testified to by Surah 4: An-Nisa': 32 - without fear of sexual molestation or harassment, Muslim societies have segregated women or put them behind shrouds or veils and locked doors on the pretext of protecting their chastity.  Amongst the changes brought about in the Muslim world by the onset of modernity has been the appearance in "public" space of an increasing number of women. The crossing by many women of the traditional boundary between the home and the world has, in fact, been a critical factor in bringing about the "Islamization" of a number of contemporary Muslim societies.<p>Massive efforts have been made by conservative Muslims to keep women segregated by insisting that a chaste Muslim woman ought to stay within the chardewari (four walls) of the home.  They have also insisted that a woman's Muslim identity is determined, largely if not solely, by whether she covers her hair or not.  The debate between "veiled" and "unveiled" women rages throughout the Muslim communities of the world and has split Muslim women from Turkey to Indonesia as well as in the Western world into rival camps.  Here, it is important to mention that according to the Qur'an confinement to the home was not the norm for chaste Muslim women but, rather, the punishment for unchaste women.  Further, it needs to be noted that "veiling" has a history which pre-dates Islam and is profoundly linked with discriminatory ideas regarding women found in the Jewish and Christian traditions.  The historical context of the Qur'anic prescriptions relating to Hijab (literally, "curtain") which refers to both seclusion and "veiling" also needs to be understood.  Special focus needs to be put on the issue of segregation and "purdah" due to its multi-faceted and vast sociological impact on the lives of millions of Muslim women.<h3>Family planning</h3>An overview of the sources of the Islamic tradition shows that there is much support for family planning within the religious and ethical framework, as well as the legal and philosophical literature, of Islam.  Despite this fact, in practice, family planning programmes continue to fare badly in most Muslim societies where the birth rate is amongst the highest in the world.  This is due, in part, to the fact that masses of Muslim women do not have adequate access to reliable means of contraception. But it is also due, in significant measure, to the widespread influence of conservative Muslims who proclaim from public platforms, as well as preach from mosque pulpits, that family planning is against Islam.<p>However, an examination of both the normative literature of Islam and the sociological factors which are relevant to the issue of family planning in contemporary Muslim societies provide strong evidence why the right to use contraception should be regarded as a fundamental human right, especially in the case of disadvantaged Muslim women whose lives are scarred by grinding poverty and massive illiteracy.<p><h3>Other theological issues</h3>Other theological issues which are important in the context of gender-justice and equity in Islam relate to statements which are widely made in Muslim societies to foreclose any discussion on the subject of women's equality with men. Amongst such statements are the following: <ul>	(a)	the evidence of one man is equal to that of two women; <br>	(b)	a woman's blood-fine is one-half of a man's blood-fine; <br>	(c)	a woman is deficient in reason whereas a man is not; <br>	(d)	a woman is less than a man in prayer or worship (on account of menstruation, childbirth, etc); <br>(e)	righteous men will be rewarded by beautiful companions in the hereafter, but no such reward exists for righteous women; <br>	(f)	a woman cannot be a prophet. </ul><p><h3>Other issues relating to women's health and well-being</h3>The negative ideas and attitudes regarding women which have become incorporated in the Islamic tradition have had a profound impact on the physical, psychological and emotional health of Muslim women.  There is, therefore, urgent need to investigate the relationship or linkage between the state of women's health and the theological framework within which they live their lives.  In particular it is important to examine the way in which masses of Muslim women perceive themselves or why many Muslim women have low self-esteem and put such little value on their life or its quality.<h3>From Re-Active to Pro Active - The Challenge for Muslim Women on the road from Cairo to Beijing</h3>The United Nations Conference on Population and Development, held in Cairo, in September 1994, was an extremely important landmark in raising global consciousness with regards to a number of issues which are central to the lives of women.  The Conference was particularly momentous for Muslim women who participated in record numbers in this Conference which was held in one of the most important capitals of the Muslim world.  The presence in Cairo of Al-Azhar University, the oldest University in the world, whose "fatwas" or religious proclamations carry much weight amongst Muslims, added further significance to the venue of this Conference. <p>In an opening session of the Conference, three male Professors representing the Al-Azhar University, presented what were labelled "Muslim viewpoints" on the subject of "Religion, Population and Development".  Only a small part of their presentations, however, dealt with the topic of Population and Development which was the subject of the Conference. After stating that Islam was not against family planning but that it allowed abortion only to save the mother's life or health, the speakers focused on the status or position of women in the Islamic tradition.  The purpose of this panel presentation by high-powered representatives of the most prestigious Muslim University in the world, was to pre-empt any discussion on the subject of Muslim women by making the "privileged" position of women in Islam clear to both the Western media (which stereotypes Muslim women as "poor and oppressed") and to Muslim women themselves.<p>In interventions from the floor, however, the "Muslim viewpoints" represented by the three male Professors of the Al-Azhar University were questioned as voices of Muslim women were conspicuous by their absence in the panel of presenters. Muslim women demanded "equal time" and they got that and more - in subsequent days when a number of sessions were held at the NGO Forum in which Muslim women figured significantly and in which women-related issues were explicated by women themselves.<p>Women's identification with body rather than with mind and spirit is a common feature of many religious, cultural and philosophical traditions.  However, though women have, traditionally, been identified with body, they have not been seen as "owners" of their bodies.  The issue of who controls women's bodies - men, the State, the Church, the Community, or women - has been one of the most important underlying issues of the Cairo Conference.  The fact that Muslim women forcefully challenged the traditional viewpoint not only with regards to women's identification with body, but also with regards to the control of the woman's body, indicates that Muslim women are no longer nameless, faceless or voiceless, and that they are ready to stand up and be counted. <p>It has now been accepted globally that issues which may appear to pertain primarily to a woman's body, namely that of contraception and abortion, cannot be looked at in isolation from the larger factor of women's overall development as human beings.  However, as pointed out by a number of persons and agencies, the primary focus of the Cairo Conference was on "population" issues focusing on the body, rather than on "development" issues which focus on the whole person. <p>The challenge before women in general, and Muslim women in particular, is to shift from the re-active mind set in which it is necessary for women to assert their autonomy over their bodies in the face of strong opposition from patriarchal structures and systems of thought and behaviour, to a pro-active mind set in which they can, finally, begin to speak of themselves as full and autonomous human beings who have not only a body, but also a mind and a spirit.  What do Muslim women - who along with Muslim men have been designated as God's vicegerent on earth by the Qur'an - understand to be the meaning of their lives? Reacting against the Western model of human liberation no longer suffices, as a pro-active orientation requires a positive formulation of one's goals and objectives.  The critical issue which Muslim women are called upon to reflect on, with utmost seriousness, between the Conferences at Cairo and Beijing, is: what kind of model of self-actualization can be developed within the framework of normative Islam which takes account of Qur'anic ideals as well as the realities of the contemporary Muslim world? <p>Santayana had remarked with acute insight that those who do not know their history are destined to repeat it.  Until such time as the vast majority of Muslim women remain unaware of the religious ideas and attitudes which constitute the matrix in which their lives are rooted, it is not possible to usher in a new era and create a new history in which the Qur'anic vision of gender-justice and equity becomes a reality.<p><i>Dr Riffat Hassan is Professor of the Religious Studies Programme at the University of Louisville, Kentucky. <br>This article is excerpted with permission from the paper she presented at the IPPF Inter-Regional Workshop on 'Women in Islam: Human Rights and Family Planning', Tunis, July 1995.</i><p> <hr><p>©Copyright IPPF 1995.<br><font size=-1>Picture: &copy;Jeremy Hammand/IPPF</font><hr><img src="ippf_pix/ippf_logo2.gif"> <a href="index.html">IPPF Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

Refugees, displaced persons and development cooperation</h2>
<h4><i>NAR Secretariat</i>
<p>
Source: <i>In Brief: Information from the NAR</i><br>No. 6, October 1993</h4>
<h5>The full text of the report in English, as well as a list of other publications, are available free of
charge from the Council's secretariat: E-mail: nar-dgis@dgis.minbuza.nl</h5>
</center>
<hr>
<b>The 102nd report of the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) on the
relationship between development cooperation and the refugee problem was presented to Mr J P Pronk,
Minister for Development Cooperation, at the beginning of October 1993.</b>
<p>
<h3>Summary of the problems and questions considered in the report</h3>

How can development cooperation help to prevent large-scale flows of refugees and combat and/or help to
forestall their negative consequences? How can host countries - developing countries in particular - be
assisted in dealing with an influx of refugees and displaced persons? These were the questions posed by the
Minister in his request for recommendations on the refugee issue. Another was how can support be given to
sustainable solutions to the refugee problem other than asylum in the region? It is a fact that more people
than ever before are now fleeing. Current estimates indicate that twenty million people have left their home-
land, while a similar number have been driven out of their homes, albeit not out of their country of origin.
The great majority of them are women and children fleeing from one developing country to another. Many
of them wait to return, sometimes for decades, in desolate camps. The report is principally concerned with
aid to such people, and definitely not with migrants coming to Europe in search of work. It does, however,
discuss the changes that the definition of a refugee has undergone in the last ten or twenty years. The
Council would associate itself with the policies developed by the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency.
<p>
However, we have to be very cautious concerning the potential contribution of development cooperation to
resolving the refugee problem. After all, the question of the extent to which economic underdevelopment is
responsible for creating refugee flows is well-nigh impossible to answer. The connection between economic
inequality and violent social upheaval is a highly complex one. Nevertheless, development cooperation is
increasingly called upon to serve as a preventive instrument, and speculation is voiced about reducing the
numbers of asylum seekers by "developing" poor regions. Leaving aside the incentive to poor government
which would result from such a policy, it is a formula that takes no account whatever of the capriciousness
and unpredictability of the refugee problem. The Council wold argue that economic underdevelopment as
such is not a major cause of refugee flows.
<p>
The question even arises of whether conflicts are inherent in the development process itself, since
development implies social change and the emergence of a new situation affecting relations between groups
and the relationship between people and their environment. Such a process rarely proceeds smoothly. Some
critics say that the current economic crisis, with all the violence it entails (such as increasing domestic and
international crime rates, conflicts involving the use of force, civil wars, drug trafficking and damage to the
environment) is the product of the dominant Western-style development model.
<p>
On the other hand, development cooperation can be seen as a potential way of preventing the conflicts which
give rise to refugee flows. Improved living standards might forestall conflicts caused by scarcity, ecological
degradation or economic inequality. However, as stated above, the causes of refugee flows are legion: the
formation of states and nations, decolonisation, sometimes linked with economic factors, problems of
institutional development, and not least environmental degradation. Violations of human rights, life-
threatening violence and national or ecological disasters drive vast numbers of people to abandon the scene
of their misfortune. Alongside the wider reality of persecution in general can be found the more personal,
individual motive of fear. All this is closely related to changes in the identity of the population of developing
countries, changes brought about to some extent by education and development, resulting in a new sense of
individuality. Such values as autonomy, personal liberty, responsibility, mutual respect and, above all,
guarantees of physical integrity thus acquire a new meaning, particularly for young people, as a result of
which violence in society is more frequently regarded as unjust and unacceptable. This may lead to political
radicalisation and hence the need to flee. At the same time, however, the numbers participating in what are
increasingly rigid political processes are declining all the time and collective action is hardly an option. In
that case there is nothing for politically aware young people in the South to do but leave. Their main
motives for doing so are - in that event - by no means economic. In general they would have stayed if they
could have been guaranteed freedom from violence or from the caprices of an unpredictable tyranny. 
<p>
<h3>Conclusions and recommendations</h3>

The Council therefore believes that development policy should be based to a greater extent on concepts of
social, economic and cultural diversity as the foundation of self-elected development from the bottom up. In
the long term a policy of this kind can have a preventive, or at least moderating, effect on polarisation and
violent outbursts of idiosyncratic fundamentalism. Moreover, as stated in NAR report no. 100, many
developing countries are the victims of skewed growth, with the result that the structure of society has
become one-sided, being dominated by economic institutions or an overgrown state apparatus. Skewed
growth of this kind often leads to social tensions, which sometimes spill over into violence, forming an
obstacle to efforts to achieve sustainable development.
<p>
In this connection the Council feels that fostering respect for human rights is vital. Measures such as early
warning systems, the physical presence of international organisations and the promotion of good governance
can have a direct preventive effect. The Council would recommend that support be given to human rights
organisations, more particularly if human rights violations are on the increase. This should be extended to
include working with other organisations which are sensitive to human rights issues, such as trade unions
and women's organisations. Early reporting of trends in the area of human rights violations is likewise
called for. Local embassies should report on law enforcement and the beginnings of trends such as
disappearances, incarceration and executions. Good reporting on human rights violations and incipient
refugee flows could also help to raise awareness of the problems, as could invitations to and assignments of
journalists and commissioning television documentaries from journalists in the relevant countries. As part of
enhanced conditionality,  all industrialised countries should declare themselves willing to accept international
monitoring of observance of human rights in their own region, in the same way as most of the states of
Europe have done by means of the European Convention on Human Rights.
<p>
The Council wishes to point out once again that 80% of the world's refugees are women and children. It
would be advisable for this to be stressed at both bilateral and multilateral level, and for policy to take
account of this fact.
<p>
The Council is very concerned to note that no more than 35% of total Dutch development aid expenditure in
1992 on refugee aid (including reception facilities for asylum seekers) went to refugees in developing
countries. This percentage is in danger of declining even further in the near future. The Council would urge
that a halt be called to this trend, adding that the provision of reception facilities for asylum seekers in the
Netherlands should no longer be paid for out of the development cooperation budget.
<p>
Asylum in the region certainly merits support. It must be remembered that what is referred to as the cultural
region for some refugees is situated in the West rather than in countries near their country of origin. Some
years ago, for example, it would have been improper for Bhutto supporters from Pakistan who sought refuge
in London to have been sent back to a camp in the sub-continent. The Council recommends that a distinction
be drawn between the policy field relating to Dutch admission and reception problems and that relating to
assistance to refugees in developing countries. Moreover, given the different timescales involved, simply
linking policy on refugees and asylum seekers with development cooperation would be in the interests of
neither.
<p>
The Council believes that development cooperation should be involved in voluntary repatriation projects for
refugees. Both bilateral and multilateral efforts can be effective, particularly in relation to the reconstruction
of a country. The restoration of human rights - political, social and economic - should also be actively
promoted. If voluntary repatriation is to work in the long term, conditions in the home country must be such
that those who return are never again compelled to seek refuge elsewhere.
<p>
Development cooperation should give more consideration to social structures in a post-conflict situation.
This means doing more to reconcile warring factions. Links could be sought with an international policy on
organising peace through development which is gradually taking shape. The Council also believes that
consideration should be given to the problem of the millions of people who have been living in exile for
many years in refugee communities with political leadership structures and military wings which wage war
for political ends. Their existence not only creates problems as far as fund-raising is concerned but also
poses dilemmas in terms of international law, since refugee status is incompatible with armed political
activism.
<p>
Refugees and their own organisations in the West should be closely involved with both repatriation projects
and reconciliation processes. Their knowledge, experience and dedication as regards development projects in
their countries of origin would then be doubly effective. Such involvement would help to stem the brain
drain from developing countries, as highly-qualified persons could contribute to the reconstruction of their
countries while Western donors could take advantage of refugees' expertise.
<p>
The Council is of the opinion that support should be given to regional, integrated approaches, which
embrace political, economic and development-related aspects of the problems associated with refugees
and/or those returning home. Such an approach requires coordination, particularly between (and within) the
UN and the EC and the various international aid organisations. The UNHCR is attempting to expand its
programmes and step up its activities. The Council believes that generous support should be given to the
UNHCR in this, as in its more traditional activities, namely increasing and improving emergency aid in
collaboration with other international organisations, donor governments and NGOs, increasing scope for
voluntary repatriation of refugees, for example by the introduction of quick impact development projects, the
resettlement of refugees whose lives or fundamental wellbeing would otherwise be threatened and measures
to improve the protection afforded refugees.

Netherlands development cooperation: Norms and policy</h2>
<h4><i>NAR Secretariat</i>
<p>
Source: <i>In Brief: Information from the NAR</i><br>No. 3, July 1993</h4>
<h5>The full text of the report in English, as well as a list of other publications, are available free of
charge from the Council's secretariat: E-mail: nar-dgis@dgis.minbuza.nl</h5>
</center>
<hr>
<b>On 1 July 1993 the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) presented the
Minister for Development Cooperation, J P Pronk, with a report on the norms and nature of the Netherlands
development cooperation.</b>
<p>
<h3>Summary</h3>

With this report, the NAR wishes to make a contribution to the current social and political discussion on
Netherlands development cooperation. The report contains the following propositions:
<ul>
<li>the current confusion regarding the nature of the Netherlands development effort and the norms
defining its extent - in that order - should be brought to an end as quickly as possible;
<li>the recently abandoned norm was in no way excessive, considering the problems, both old and new,
confronting developing countries;
<li>the problems currently facing developing countries need to be re-assessed in the light of recent
developments;
<li>there is an urgent need for a clear policy, particularly in the light of current public opinion in the
Netherlands - as perceived by the Council - regarding development cooperation.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Time for clarity</h3>

The NAR urges that a number of measures should be taken within the coming five years to address the
problems, both old and new, facing development policy. Aid to the poorest developing countries should be
increased, with less going to the richer ones. More scope should be created for assistance to Central and
Eastern Europe and to tackle environmental problems. With this new framework for aid established, the
norm for the Netherlands contribution should be set at a new level - 1.5% of NNI (Net National Income)
after the five-year period.
<p>
Furthermore, the Council urges that the multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay round) be completed as
soon as possible and in such a way as to increase the export potential of developing countries. The Council
also believes that there is scope for drawing up regional trade agreements between the North and South.
<p>
Protection of the markets of the rich countries against the import of goods and the migration of labour from
developing countries restricts the development potential of these countries. The Council sees this as a further
reason for providing assistance, to compensate for these restrictions.
<p>
Discussion of new tasks in the areas of the environment, peace and security and aid to Central and Eastern
Europe should not be avoided. These issues are relevant to development cooperation and should, under
certain conditions,  be integrated into development policy.
<p>
In the interests of effectiveness and to prevent fragmentation, the Council advocates reducing the number of
countries (currently 54) which receive aid from the Netherlands. In addition, efforts aimed at structural
poverty alleviation should be concentrated in the 37 poorest countries with which the Netherlands already
has a development relationship. Expansion of the programme to countries in Central and Eastern Europe
will make further streamlining  necessary.
<p>
<h3>Stop the political erosion of development cooperation</h3>

The NAR is optimistic regarding the extent of public support for development cooperation in the Nether-
lands. It laments the erosion of development policy at the political level and the emergence of a political
decision-making process which is both unclear and out of line with the intentions and preferences of a large
part of the Netherlands population. The "contamination" of the budget, which has increased considerably
since 1989, should be rectified within a specified period to allow scope for the proposed new policy.
<p>
<h3>Measures</h3>

Given the current situation, the Council recommends that the government undertake the following action
during the coming five years:
<ol>
<li>Official Development Assistance (ODA): The first priority should be to increase ODA to developing
countries through multilateral and bilateral programmes (including those of the Co-Financing Organisations)
from its current level of 0.78% to 1,0% of GNP in the 1998 budget. The table below indicates how the
development budget should be allocated:

</TR>
<TR>
<TD>* very rough estimate</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>


<p>
<li>'Purification' of the budget: A clearer picture should be given of the expenditure that should, now or
in the future, be included in the aid budget. A number of the items that are currently covered by the budget
(see annex 3) should be removed. These include the costs of accommodating asylum-seekers, the
contribution to the Ministry of Education and Science and a number of others which are in no way related to
the interests of developing countries. The first two items mentioned account for 36% of the non-ODA part
of the 1993 development budget (NLG 497.7m of a total of NLG 1,385m). The total non-ODA part of the
budget is 0.24% of GNP or 0.31% of NNI. This purification should be effected within a specified period
(for example, five years);
<p>
<li>Choice of countries: In the interests of efficiency, the criteria for countries eligible for development
assistance from the Netherlands should be tightened up. In respect of the ODA contribution, at least 80%
should be allocated to countries with a per capita income of US$ 650 or less and no ODA should be
allocated to countries with a per capita income higher than US$ 1,235 (1991 levels). Countries falling
between these two limits may be eligible for concessional loans on ODA terms in exceptional circumstances;
<p>
<li>New countries: Aid to countries in Central and Eastern Europe will automatically be categorised as
ODA when they qualify for the DAC list and if the aid is sufficiently concessional. This assistance should
be provided from regular development funds, as far as this is made possible by reducing the contamination
of the budget. If this proves insufficient, additional funds will have to be released;
<p>
<li>Environmental expenditure: Contributions that are made by the Netherlands through bilateral and
multilateral (e.g. GEF) channels to help developing countries on the DAC list comply with international
environmental agreements will automatically be considered ODA by the DAC. This assistance should be
provided from regular development funds, as far as this is made possible by reducing the contamination of
the budget. If this proves insufficient, additional funds will have to be released;
<p>
<li>Separation of expenditure: Certain items that fall under the development budget which are relevant to
developing countries but are not ODA as defined by the DAC should be given a ceiling. This expenditure
includes such items as administrative expenses, certain interest subsidies, etc. It is recommended that a
ceiling of 0.14% of GNP be imposed on these items within a period of five years;
<p>
<li>Security: Development funds should not be used to put an end to armed conflict but to provide
humanitarian aid and support for reconstruction once conflicts have been resolved. Assessment of defence
spending by developing countries and subsequent policy should as far as possible follow the criteria drawn
up jointly by donors. Support for the setting up of democratic institutions at both national and local level and
including institutions to guarantee access to reliable legal procedures should be given high priority.
</ol>
<p>
"It would be a miracle if we succeed, functioning as we do". These words were used by Jawaharlal Nehru
when he presented India's first Five-Year Plan. The NAR believes that international problems in the areas
of security, poverty and the environment will increase in both size and intensity during the coming decade,
demanding a greater international effort and greater sacrifices from the industrialised countries. As a
development partner and in its role as international defender of the interests of developing countries and the
poor that inhabit them, the Netherlands should reaffirm that it is able to provide an appropriate and reliable
contribution to the solution of these issues. Where possible the Netherlands should strive to attain a higher
norm - two per cent of NNI is not an excessive target.

<h3>Les strat&#233;gies nationales de d&#233;veloppement durable<p>L'aide de la C.E. et le d&#233;veloppement durable: Note d'information No. 3, 1995</h3>



<I>Il est maintenant généralement admis que l’intégration à la planification stratégique des facteurs écologiques, sociaux et économiques s’impose pour réaliser des progrès sensibles dans le sens d’un développement durable. Ce thème a pris une importance accrue lors de la Conférence des Nations unies sur l’environnement et le développement (CNUED) de 1992, notamment dans le cadre d’Action 21 - plan d’action mondial pour le développement durable qui avance les stratégies nationales de développement durable (SNDD) comme mécanismes de traduction des discours et engagements de la CNUED en politiques et actions concrètes permettant aux différentes nations de définir et mettre en oeuvre des priorités de développement durable. Cette Note d’information traite du concept de SNDD, examine certaines des leçons tirées de l’expérience passée et présente quelques idées pour relever le défi de l’élaboration de stratégies. Des suggestions sont faites quant aux modalités optimales de soutien des efforts des pays en développement en ce domaine par les donateurs, la C.E. par exemple</I>. 
<p>
On a élaboré, ces dix dernières années, de nombreuses et diverses approches des stratégies et plans formant la politique de l’environnement et du développement. Parmi les plus connues on relève les stratégies nationales de conservation (SNC) et les plans  d’action nationaux pour l’environnement (PANE), dont les promoteurs respectifs sont l’Union mondiale pour la nature (dont le sigle demeure «UICN») et la Banque mondiale. Or, il existe toute une palette d’autres approches comme, par exemple, les plans d’action forestière et les plans de lutte contre la désertification. Des conventions internationales récemment conclues sur la biodiversité, le changement climatique et la désertification prévoient aussi d’autres plans d’action nationaux.
<p>
Dans le monde entier, plus de 100 pays préparent et mettent en oeuvre actuellement des formes de planification stratégique en matière d’environnement et de développement, tout en leur donnant des appellations diverses. Une grande partie de ces approches, dans les pays en développement et les pays récemment industrialisés, a reçu le soutien de donateurs bilatéraux, de banques de développement multilatérales (notamment la Banque mondiale) et d’institutions onusiennes (notamment le PNUD dans le cadre de son initiative «Capacités 21»). De cette accumulation continue d’expérience en matière de stratégies se dégage un consensus autour des éléments du processus qui, semble-t-il, donnent les meilleurs résultats.

<H3>Les enseignements de l’expérience passée</H3>

L’expérience montre qu’aucun type d’approche exclusif, aucune formule unique, ne peuvent ni ne doivent déterminer la forme des SNDD. Il revient à chaque pays de déterminer, pour son propre compte, la meilleure façon d’en aborder la préparation et la mise en oeuvre. Dans une large mesure, le processus retenu sera façonné par les circonstances politiques, bureaucratiques et culturelles du moment ainsi que par les variations, d’un pays à l’autre, des conditions économiques, écologiques et sociales.
<p>
Par conséquent, une approche de type «schéma général» n’est ni possible, ni souhaitable. Néanmoins, l’étude récente, effectuée par l’IIED/UICN, d’un vaste corpus de stratégies utilisées dans le passé partout dans le monde, a fait apparaître un certain nombre d’enseignements fondamentaux et quelques principes directeurs (cf. Encadré No 1). Elle a également mis en exergue certaines démarches apparemment communes aux stratégies les plus performantes:
<p>
<center>
<table border=1 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><center><h4>Encadré 1: Enseignements et principes</h4></center>
<p>
L’expérience montre que, pour assurer la réussite et l’efficacité d’une SNDD :<ul><li>elle doit consister en un processus cyclique de planification et d’action où l’accent est mis sur la gestion des progrès vers des objectifs de durabilité plutôt que sur la production d’un «plan» ou produit final (cf. Figure 1) ;<li>elle doit être réellement multisectorielle et intégrante, cherchant à assurer l’engagement des parties intéressées et à surmonter la fragmentation des institutions et des politiques ;<li>il est indispensable de se concentrer sur les thèmes prioritaires et d’identifier des objectifs-clés et des cibles premières, ainsi que les moyens de les atteindre ;<li>elle doit assurer une «participation la plus large possible» ; ceci veut dire partager les responsabilités et constituer des partenariats entre tous les acteurs concernés - groupes commerciaux, groupes communautaires et groupes d’intérêt, ainsi que les gouvernements - mais seulement lorsque les partenaires le jugent opportun ;<li>elle doit adopter une approche adaptative et souple, reconnaissant que la complexité et l’incertitude caractérisent les problèmes et que les réponses politiques et les capacités technologiques évoluent au fil du temps ;<li>il est indispensable de créer des mécanismes de suivi, d’évaluation et d’extraction des enseignements de l’expérience et de les intégrer totalement au processus ;<li>il faut reconnaître que la préparation d’une SNDD est une expérience de renforcement de capacités et doit être organisée de façon à valoriser les dispositions institutionnelles, aiguiser les concepts et les outils, favoriser les connaissances et compétences professionnelles et sensibiliser le public.</ul>

</center>
<p>
<I>Déterminer si les conditions sont favorables</I> - par exemple : climat politique et social propice, soutien politique de haut niveau et financement suffisant.
<p>
<I>Repérer un point d’ancrage</I>. Une SNDD doit prendre la forme d’un processus cyclique (cf. Figure 1). Certains éléments se suivent naturellement, tandis que d’autres (par exemple l’analyse, le suivi et l’évaluation des informations et une partie de la mise en oeuvre) sont en activité permanente pendant toute la durée du cycle. Une nouvelle stratégie doit tenir compte de ce qui s’est passé auparavant et s’ancrer éventuellement dans la phase atteinte par une autre stratégie, antérieure ou en cours d’application, dont l’importance le justifie.
<p>
<I>Établir un organisme d’entraînement du processus</I>. Très souvent, il s’agit d’installer un secrétariat, dont le personnel ait de bonnes compétences de gestion et proviennent en partie des services gouvernementaux et en partie d’autres origines. Le secrétariat pourra rendre compte à un Comité directeur à la composition largement représentative et qui sera doté d’une présidence indépendante. Aucun de ces deux organismes ne devra avoir des intérêts sectoriels à protéger, ni être enraciné dans un secteur ou groupe d’intérêt.
<p>	
<I>Arrêter le choix de la conception du processus</I>. Le Comité directeur et le secrétariat auront à déterminer la portée de la stratégie, le choix des principaux groupes intéressés devant participer, les thèmes abordés, l’approche adoptée et les modalités de gestion des éléments individuels du cycle stratégique (cf. Figure 1).
<p>
<I>Sélectionner les participants</I>. La participation suppose que tous les groupes intéressés (aussi bien gouvernementaux que non gouvernementaux) jouent pleinement leur rôle dans les domaines appropriés, y compris la conception de la stratégie, l’échange d’information, la prise de décisions, la mise en oeuvre, etc. Il convient de décider dans quelle mesure la participation est possible et nécessaire et d’en élaborer les mécanismes : groupes pivots, tables rondes, ateliers, techniques communautaires, etc.
<p>
<I>Recueillir et analyser l’information</I>. On procède alors par études sur dossiers et ateliers, en mettant à contribution des organismes gouvernementaux, des universités, des instituts de recherche et de formulation de politiques ainsi que des professionnels indépendants.
<p>
<I>Formuler les politiques et assigner les priorités</I>. Dans le cadre de forums appropriés (par ex. les dialogues à thème politique et les tables rondes), établir les principes, buts et objectifs de la stratégie, ainsi que des indicateurs pour en mesurer l’accomplissement.
<p>
<I>Aborder les questions difficiles du développement durable</I> -  les grands problèmes, obstacles et risques feront l’objet d’opinions et d’attitudes divergentes. Comme il y aura vraisemblablement des gagnants et des perdants, des compromis s’imposeront. Les dialogues politiques devront se concentrer tout d’abord sur les situations du type «gagnant-gagnant», avant de passer au traitement des problèmes plus délicats.
<p>
<I>Planifier et budgétiser les actions</I>. Une SNDD consiste en une approche «macro» exigeant sur le terrain des actions «micro» : changements politiques, législatifs, institutionnels et organisationnels, renforcement des capacités du gouvernement, des ONG et des communautés locales, ainsi toute une gamme de programmes et de projets.
<p>
<I>Mise en oeuvre et renforcement des capacités</I> - s’étendant au secteur commercial, aux ONG et aux communautés ainsi qu’au gouvernement. Ce dernier peut créer un «environnement favorisant» les actions de développement de toutes les composantes de la société tandis que les ONG pourront jouer un rôle-clé en catalysant la participation et l’action locale.
<p>
<I>Communications</I> - tenir les participants au courant des progrès réalisés, exprimer le consensus, faire mieux connaître le développement durable et encourager la participation - à l’aide de notes et de bulletins d’information et en stimulant une couverture médiatique, etc.
<p>
<I>Suivi et évaluation</I> - des processus comme des produits. Cette double fonction peut être interne ou externe, ou menée en collaboration entre le personnel chargé de la stratégie, les participants et des évaluateurs externes. Il faut choisir des indicateurs reflétant l’état et les tendances évolutives d’un élément ou d’un produit particulier du processus.

<p>
<H3>Disposer d’une stratégie a ses avantages</H3>

Une stratégie peut être utile aux décideurs à de nombreux titres, car elle aide à :
<ul>
<li>définir des options, des objectifs, des cibles et des politiques de développement durable, ainsi que leurs valeurs sous-jacentes ;
<li>analyser les questions économiques, écologiques et sociales en totalité et de manière intégrée ;
<li>identifier et évaluer les options (réformes juridiques, développement institutionnel, etc...) permettant de traiter les questions prioritaires ;
<li>décider des priorités, identifier les plans et programmes de développement et en orienter la mise en oeuvre ;
<li>affecter des ressources limitées ;
<li>contribuer à renforcer les capacités afin de faire face aux questions complexes du développement.
</ul><p>
Plusieurs avantages dérivent, directement (à partir du processus même) et indirectement (comme aboutissement du développement durable), de la formulation d’une SNDD. On peut identifier les avantages suivants :
<ul>
<li>elle rend possible l’élaboration de politiques gouvernementales de développement durable et permet de forger un consensus à leur sujet ;
<li>elle accroît l’efficacité de telles politiques et actions ;
<li>elle permet de mobiliser et libérer les énergies et les ressources humaines, financières et autres d’une nation, sur le plan interne (national) et externe (international), au profit du développement durable ;
<li>elle aide les pays en développement à coordonner le soutien des donateurs - par exemple au moyen de tables rondes regroupant des donateurs envisageant de soutenir une série intégrée d’initiatives aux priorités hiérarchisées en fonction d’une stratégie ;
<li>elle pousse à respecter les exigences des conventions internationales en matière de comptes rendus ;
<li>elle facilite l’intégration d’objectifs divergents en matière de développement ainsi que la résolution de conflits engendrés par des différences de valeurs et de perspectives.
</ul><p>
Quant aux avantages indirects, seul un petit nombre d’entre eux sera quantifiable (par exemple la création de revenus et d’emplois). D’autres s’avéreront moins tangibles et mesurables (exemple: la fourniture et la maintenance de services vitaux comme l’absorption des déchets solides et des émissions industrielles, les dispositifs de lutte contre l’érosion, etc...). Des cas de résultats obtenus en applications de stratégies figurent à l’encadré No 2.

<tr><td><center><h4>Encadré No 2 : Quelques exemples de résultats de stratégies</h4></center>
<p>
Botswana (Stratégie nationale de conservation) : l’intérêt manifesté pour les problèmes d’environnement lors de la préparation et de la mise en oeuvre du Plan national de développement économique a connu une sensible augmentation. Des institutions ont été établies avec comme domaines de responsabilité le développement durable et le respect des procédures d’ÉIE (étude d’impact écologique). Cela a permis de réaliser d’importantes économies liées à la sélection des sites de barrages, ainsi que l’annulation du projet intégré de développement hydraulique du Sud Okavango, dont les impacts  financiers, économiques et sociaux étaient suspects.
<p>
Costa Rica (Stratégie nationale de conservation pour le développement durable) : cette stratégie a joué un rôle très influent dans l’établissement de l’Institut national de la biodiversité, organisme novateur.
<p>
Pays-Bas (Plan national de politique d’environnement - PNPE, PNPE Plus et PNPE 2) : ces différentes moutures du PNPE comprennent une stratégie dont le but ambitieux est de parvenir en une seule génération au développement durable, certains groupes impliqués bien définis devant atteindre leurs objectifs quant à une amélioration significative de l’environnement et se livrer à des activités quantifiables. 17 conventions ont été signées entre le gouvernement et les secteurs industriels et d’autres ont été négociées. Une fois mis au point, le processus d’élimination de 80 % de la pollution industrielle du pays sera géré par ce mécanisme.
<p>
Pakistan (Stratégie nationale de conservation) : illustration de premier ordre d’un processus exemplaire, cette SNC fut le premier grand exemple de consultation au niveau national ayant porté sur des problèmes de développement et d’environnement du Pakistan, la participation des ONG et du secteur privé ayant été couronnée de succès. La SNC a ouvert la voie aux stratégies provinciales, actuellement en cours de réalisation ; c’est dans leur contexte, alors qu’elles donnent lieu à une consultation plus intensive des groupes d’utilisateurs de ressources, que les objectifs seront fixés. La Banque mondiale a accepté la SCN comme l’équivalent d’un PANE.

<H3>Les défis actuels</H3>

De nombreux gouvernements de pays en développement réfléchissent aux meilleurs moyens possibles d’élaborer une SNDD répondant aux critères d’Action 21. Une des tâches essentielles qu’il leur faut accomplir consiste à développer une capacité de penser et d’agir de façon stratégique en matière de développement durable. Il faudra convaincre les responsables du lancement d’une SNDD (en régle générale, membres haut placés du gouvernement) qu’une stratégie doit être un processus continu et cyclique, imbriqué dans la planification traditionnelle du développement et susceptible de l’améliorer. Il devront aussi promouvoir l’élaboration de stratégies aux divers niveaux structurant le pays (provinces, districts, villes, communautés locales) et prévoir des articulations efficaces entre les stratégies de ces différents niveaux. À l’avenir, les détails des politiques et des plans d’action relèveront donc des institutions et des communautés responsables de leur mise en oeuvre.
<p>
Il faut que la CE et les autres donateurs réfléchissent aux modalités optimales de fourniture d’aide aux pays en développement, tout en tenant compte d’un certain nombre de facteurs. Les donateurs doivent :
<ul>
<li>appuyer des initiatives émanant du pays-cible et aboutissant à un engagement du gouvernement, plutôt que des processus émanant des donateurs et donnant lieu à des processus concernant ces derniers ;
<p>
<li>éviter d’imposer un modèle stratégique quelconque ou d’exercer une influence excessive sur ses principes, notamment en s’en servant pour assurer le caractère conditionnel de l’aide - les critiques et le ressentiment abondent dans les pays en développement au sujet de la Banque mondiale et de son utilisation de l’élaboration d’un «PANE acceptable» comme condition d’obtention de fonds de l’AID.
<p>
<li>reconnaître que l’élaboration de stratégies suppose un engagement à long terme ; et éviter d’envoyer des «équipes d’expatriés» pour diriger le processus ;
<p>
<li>admettre qu’une bonne stratégie leur permettra de maximiser la valeur de leur aide en ciblant les besoins prioritaires négociés et décidés par un pays.
</ul>
<p>
De nos jours, avancer vers le développement durable représente vraisemblablement le défi le plus difficile lancé au décideurs de tous niveaux et aux populations de toutes les nations. En l’absence de mécanismes et de processus efficaces servant à mettre à contribution les compétences, les valeurs et les perspectives de chaque nation, ce défi ne risque guère d’être relevé. L’élaboration d’une stratégie de développement durable, animée au plan national, représente un moyen d’y parvenir.

<p>
<h3>R&#233;sum&#233; des probl&#232;mes pos&#233;s dans l'avis</h3>

Quelle peut &ecirc;tre la contribution des Pays-Bas, dans le cadre de leur politique de coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement, &#224; la formulation et &#224; la mise en oeuvre d'une politique
d&#233;mographique? C'est sur cette question que le ministre de la Coop&#233;ration a demand&#233; au
Conseil d'&#233;mettre un avis, en vue de la pr&#233;paration de la Conf&#233;rence internationale sur la
population et le d&#233;veloppement, qui aura lieu au Caire en septembre 1994. La d&#233;l&#233;gation
n&#233;erlandaise &#224; la Conf&#233;rence sera &#233;galement appel&#233;e &#224; faire
conna&icirc;tre son point de vue sur l'avortement, sur la relation entre le droit des femmes &#224; choisir
ou non d'avoir des enfants et les objectifs d&#233;mographiques, ainsi que sur la relation entre les droits
des femmes et les responsabilit&#233;s des hommes. Le Conseil aborde ces diff&#233;rents points dans cet
avis. 
<p>
La politique d&#233;mographique touchant l'individu dans ses relations, ses normes et ses valeurs les plus
intimes, ainsi que dans ses strat&#233;gies de survie, elle constitue un sujet d&#233;licat, suscitant souvent
des r&#233;actions passionn&#233;es. Pourtant un consensus se d&#233;gage de plus en plus au niveau
mondial sur la n&#233;cessit&#233; de freiner la croissance d&#233;mographique mondiale. Cette prise de
conscience s'explique notamment par l'attention accrue apport&#233;e au d&#233;veloppement durable. En
effet, la croissance d&#233;mographique repr&#233;sente une charge de plus en plus grande pour
l'environnement. Mais des mod&#232;les non durables de production et de consommation portent tout
autant atteinte &#224; l'environnement. Les probl&#232;mes r&#233;sultent pr&#233;cis&#233;ment de la
relation complexe entre la question d&#233;mographique et des mod&#232;les de production et de
consommation qui se caract&#233;risent par une r&#233;partition in&#233;gale des richesses et du pouvoir.
<p>
Ce sont surtout les pauvres qui voient dans les enfants une s&#233;curit&#233; pour l'avenir. Et, dans le
m&ecirc;me temps, ce sont les pauvres qui, faute d'avoir acc&#232;s aux moyens de r&#233;gulation des
naissances, se trouvent limit&#233;s dans leurs choix au niveau de la procr&#233;ation. Par ailleurs, il est
connu que le manque d'acc&#232;s &#224; l'enseignement, aux soins de sant&#233; et au travail conduit
&#224; une f&#233;condit&#233; &#233;lev&#233;e. La politique d&#233;mographique doit donc
s'inscrire dans une strat&#233;gie globale de lutte contre la pauvret&#233;, et inversement. Car une
croissance d&#233;mographique qui reste &#233;lev&#233;e entrave pr&#233;cis&#233;ment la lutte
contre la pauvret&#233;. Et il est ainsi de plus en plus difficile de r&#233;aliser l'objectif de la
qualit&#233; de l'existence pour le plus grand nombre. La croissance d&#233;mographique appara&icirc;t
donc comme &#233;troitement li&#233;e &#224; la pauvret&#233;.
<p>
Mais la croissance d&#233;mographique n'est pas toujours le seul ou le principal probl&#232;me. La
dispersion g&#233;ographique, la pyramide des &#226;ges (vieillissement) et la migration ont
&#233;galement une influence sur la structure d'un groupe de population et peuvent engendrer des
probl&#232;mes. L'urbanisation en particulier, c'est-&#224;-dire la concentration croissante de la
population dans les villes, constitue un probl&#232;me de plus en plus aigu. Cela signifie donc qu'il n'y a
pas un seul probl&#232;me d&#233;mographique, et qu'il n'y a donc pas de solution unique.
<p>
La f&#233;condit&#233; - c'est &#224; dire le nombre d'enfants par femme - varie consid&#233;rablement
en fonction de leur situation socio-&#233;conomique, de leur environnement culturel et religieux et de leurs
perspectives d'avenir, lesquels sont &#233;videmment indissociables de celles des hommes. Toutefois,
l'in&#233;galit&#233; entre les hommes et les femmes au niveau du pouvoir de d&#233;cision, aussi bien
dans les relations individuelles qu'&#224; l'&#233;chelle publique, exerce une influence consid&#233;rable
sur les mod&#232;les en mati&#232;re de procr&#233;ation. Dans la plupart des pays, les joies et les
charges de l'enfantement et de l'&#233;ducation des enfants sont tr&#232;s in&#233;galement
r&#233;parties. On constate, dans la formulation et la mise en oeuvre de la politique d&#233;mographique,
une tendance &#224; faire des femmes l'instrument d'une politique de r&#233;gulation des naissances. Les
femmes se trouvent ainsi limit&#233;es dans leur autonomie, tout en devant assumer la pleine
responsabilit&#233; de la r&#233;duction de la croissance d&#233;mographique. La traduction de la
politique d&#233;mographique en programmes de planning familial ne r&#233;pond pas suffisamment aux
besoins des femmes.
<p>
&Agrave; la suite de l'&#233;volution des conceptions sur la r&#233;gulation des naissances, les services
de planning familial ne sont plus uniquement consid&#233;r&#233;s comme un moyen de r&#233;duire la
croissance d&#233;mographique, mais plut&ocirc;t comme un &#233;l&#233;ment d'un train plus vaste de
mesures ax&#233;es en particulier sur la sant&#233; des femmes en mati&#232;re de procr&#233;ation.
Ces mesures portent non seulement sur la fourniture de moyens contraceptifs, l'&#233;ducation sexuelle et
la pr&#233;vention, mais aussi sur le diagnostic et le traitement des maladies et autres infections
sexuellement transmissibles, ainsi que sur l'assistance m&#233;dicale en cas de grossesse non
d&#233;sir&#233;e. Des &#233;tudes effectu&#233;es r&#233;cemment sur l'efficacit&#233; des
programmes de planning familial par les institutions oeuvrant dans le domaine de la politique
d&#233;mographique, telles que le PNUAP, la Banque mondiale et le Conseil d&#233;mographique,
indiquent que le succ&#232;s de ces programmes est moins tributaire de facteurs quantitatifs que de facteurs
qualitatifs (traitements respectant davantage l'individu, mesures ad&#233;quates d'accompagnement, etc.).
<p>
Par ailleurs, dans le d&#233;bat international, ces mesures sont le plus souvent plac&#233;es dans une
perspective plus large: le planning familial n'est qu'un des &#233;l&#233;ments qui permettent de freiner la
croissance d&#233;mographique. En effet, cette croissance est le r&#233;sultat &#224; la fois de la
f&#233;condit&#233; non d&#233;sir&#233;e, de la f&#233;condit&#233; d&#233;sir&#233;e et du
"moment" d&#233;mographique, c'est-&#224;- dire l'accroissement du nombre de femmes et d'hommes
f&#233;conds &#224; la suite de l'augmentation des naissances dans la g&#233;n&#233;ration
pr&#233;c&#233;dente. Le planning familial n'est efficace qu'au niveau de la f&#233;condit&#233; non
d&#233;sir&#233;e, elle n'a aucune influence sur d'autres &#233;l&#233;ments d&#233;terminant la
croissance d&#233;mographique. Cela signifie que la politique d&#233;mographique doit &ecirc;tre
int&#233;gr&#233;e dans la politique globale, comme &#233;tant un aspect d'une politique socio-
&#233;conomique plus large. De plus, les politiques &#233;ducative et sanitaire devraient &#233;galement
&ecirc;tre adapt&#233;es en fonction des objectifs de la politique d&#233;mographique. En effet, la
dur&#233;e de scolarit&#233; des femmes reste toujours le meilleur indicateur du nombre d'enfants qu'elles
auront: plus le niveau d'enseignement est &#233;lev&#233;, moins la femme a d'enfants. La
mortalit&#233; infantile joue &#233;galement un r&ocirc;le dans l'ins&#233;curit&#233; quant &#224;
l'avenir. Il importe donc d'accorder davantage de cr&#233;dits aux secteurs de l'&#233;ducation et de la
sant&#233;, et la politique socio-&#233;conomique doit veiller &#224; modifier la r&#233;partition des
t&#226;ches entre les hommes et les femmes. Le souci d'assurer ses vieux jours a une influence sur les
d&#233;cisions relatives au nombre d'enfants, tout en permettant de satisfaire les besoins du nombre
croissant de personnes &#226;g&#233;es dans de nombreux pays en d&#233;veloppement. Le rythme du
ph&#233;nom&#232;ne de vieillissement fait qu'il est souhaitable de tenir compte dans la r&#233;partition
des cr&#233;dits des besoins sp&#233;cifiques des personnes &#226;g&#233;es, dont les femmes
constituent un pourcentage &#233;lev&#233;. Enfin, l'urbanisation n&#233;cessite d'adapter les mesures
sanitaires en mati&#232;re de procr&#233;ation aux conditions de vie sp&#233;cifiques et aux
diff&#233;rences de comportement au niveau de la sexualit&#233; et de la procr&#233;ation dans les villes.

<p>

<h3>Conclusions et recommandations</h3>

Il est important que les gens aient acc&#232;s &#224; des &#233;quipements et des mesures sanitaires de
qualit&#233; en mati&#232;re de procr&#233;ation, afin d'&ecirc;tre en mesure de faire librement le choix
du nombre d'enfants qu'ils souhaitent. Cela s'applique tout particuli&#232;rement aux femmes qui n'ont que
peu d'influence sur leurs relations sexuelles et qui ne peuvent pas d&#233;cider elles-m&ecirc;mes de leur
f&#233;condit&#233;. L'acc&#232;s limit&#233; des filles et des femmes &#224; l'enseignement et la
r&#233;partition traditionnelle des t&#226;ches au sein de la famille d&#233;terminent le cadre dans lequel
elles doivent faire leurs choix en mati&#232;re de maternit&#233;. Et, dans bien des pays, la
l&#233;gislation contribue &#224; restreindre les possibilit&#233;s de choix.
<p>
Le Conseil arrive &#224; la conclusion que le planning familial doit &ecirc;tre plac&#233; sous le signe de
la politique sanitaire en mati&#232;re de procr&#233;ation. Il est essentiel que les programmes qui sont
pr&#233;sent&#233;s dans le cadre du planning familial comprennent un large &#233;ventail de services de
qualit&#233;. Si l'on ne fournit pas les bons contraceptifs (par exemple la pilule en cas de contre-indication
ou un st&#233;rilet alors qu'il y a infection) ou si l'on ne donne pas suffisamment d'informations sur les
effets secondaires, les femmes renonceront &#224; participer aux programmes. Outre la mise &#224;
disposition de contraceptifs, il faut &#233;galement offrir aux femmes des possibilit&#233;s de diagnostic et
de traitement des maladies sexuellement transmissibles et des infections des organes de reproduction. Il faut
veiller &#224; toucher &#233;galement les jeunes ainsi que les femmes non mari&#233;es ou
c&#233;libataires. Le Conseil estime qu'il faut &#233;galement conscientiser les hommes, par des
programmes d'information appropri&#233;s, par rapport &#224; leurs responsabilit&#233;s en
mati&#232;re de comportement sexuel et de f&#233;condit&#233;.
<p>
Le train de mesures doit &#233;galement comprendre la possibilit&#233; d'avortement m&#233;dicalement
assist&#233; pour les femmes confront&#233;es &#224; une grossesse non d&#233;sir&#233;e. Les
grossesses non d&#233;sir&#233;es peuvent r&#233;sulter du manque d'acc&#232;s &#224; de bonnes
m&#233;thodes de r&#233;gulation des naissances ou de l'&#233;chec des moyens utilis&#233;s, mais
aussi, dans bien des cas, de la violence exerc&#233;e contre les femmes, du viol, que se soit ou non au sein
de la famille, et dans des situations de guerre. Le Conseil consid&#232;re qu'il faut attirer l'attention des
pouvoirs publics sur leurs responsabilit&#233;s en mati&#232;re de sant&#233; des femmes et de
l&#233;galisation de l'avortement pour permettre des avortements m&#233;dicalement s&ucirc;rs.
<p>
Le Conseil arrive &#224; la conclusion en concernant du paiement aux groupes cibles de primes visant
&#224; r&#233;duire la f&#233;condit&#233;, qu'un tel instrument se heurte &#224; des objections de
principe et &#224; de grandes difficult&#233;s pratiques au niveau de la mise en oeuvre. Le Conseil est
d'avis que, dans la pratique, il n'existe pas de m&#233;thode, &#233;conomiquement fructueuse, qui offre
une garantie suffisante que de tels instruments ne conduisent pas &#224; des abus, &#233;tant donn&#233;
les conditions de corruption, le statut peu &#233;lev&#233; des femmes et la pauvret&#233; qui
r&#232;gnent dans ces pays. Le Conseil consid&#232;re, en revanche, que l'on pourrait indemniser les
frais engag&#233;s pour accro&icirc;tre l'accessibilit&#233; des services de planning familial, par exemple
en remboursant les frais de transport d'une visite &#224; la clinique.
<p>
Le Conseil recommande de soutenir davantage la recherche visant &#224; am&#233;liorer et &#224;
&#233;largir concr&#232;tement l'offre de m&#233;thodes de r&#233;gulation des naissances, la
pr&#233;f&#233;rence devant &ecirc;tre donn&#233;e &#224; la recherche sur les contraceptifs masculins.
Le Conseil recommande &#233;galement de soutenir les travaux de recherche portant sur des
m&#233;thodes dont les femmes peuvent contr&ocirc;ler elles-m&ecirc;mes l'utilisation. On peut songer
dans ce contexte aux travaux actuellement en cours sur l'&#233;laboration d'un gel protecteur contre
l'infection par le VIH, dont deux vari&#233;t&#233;s sont mises au point, l'une en tant que contraceptif,
l'autre en tant que simple moyen de protection contre l'infection et ne compromettant donc pas la
f&#233;condit&#233;. Le Conseil estime moins heureux de soutenir la recherche et l'inoculation de vaccins
immunologiques aux femmes, &#233;tant donn&#233; les dangers potentiels li&#233;s &#224; leur
application ainsi que le contr&ocirc;le limit&#233; que les femmes peuvent exercer sur ces m&#233;thodes.
<p>
Il faut chercher, dans la formulation de la politique d&#233;mographique, des possibilit&#233;s
concr&#232;tes de faire une plus grande place aux objectifs des populations cibles. Le Conseil
consid&#232;re qu'il est indispensable de concr&#233;tiser des m&#233;canismes de participation aux
programmes d&#233;mographiques. Des commissions de conseil ou d'encadrement, au sein desquelles
seraient repr&#233;sent&#233;es des organisations priv&#233;es, des organisations non gouvernementales
et en particulier des organisations de femmes, pourraient par exemple &ecirc;tre associ&#233;es &#224; la
formulation et &#224; la mise en oeuvre de programmes. De plus, les programmes doivent pr&#233;voir
des formes d'&#233;valuation conjointe avec les groupes cibles.
<p>
Le Conseil est d'avis qu'il faut engager un d&#233;bat ouvert avec l'&Eacute;glise catholique sur les effets
des conceptions qu'elle professe en mati&#232;re de sexualit&#233; et de r&#233;gulation de la
f&#233;condit&#233;.
<p>
Le Conseil souligne les points communs qui caract&#233;risent l'approche de nombreux mouvements
&#233;cologistes et mouvements f&#233;ministes. Ces points communs se manifestent tr&#232;s clairement
lorsqu'on soumet &#224; un examen critique les mod&#232;les actuels de d&#233;veloppement dans le
contexte du souci du d&#233;veloppement durable. Il n'est pas possible de modifier ces mod&#232;les sans
changer les rapports de force existants et la r&#233;partition in&#233;gale du pouvoir et des richesses.
Dans une telle approche, une place centrale serait donn&#233;e aux strat&#233;gies de survie et &#224; la
participation des pauvres. Une strat&#233;gie commune doit viser &#224; obtenir la promesse des
responsables politiques qu'ils affecteront davantage de cr&#233;dits &#224; une approche large et
int&#233;gr&#233;e des probl&#232;mes d&#233;mographiques.
<p>
En ce qui concerne le dialogue sur les probl&#232;mes d&#233;mographiques dans le Sud entre les
gouvernements des pays industrialis&#233;s et les gouvernements des pays en d&#233;veloppement, il
importe que le Nord ne cherche pas non plus &#224; fuir ses responsabilit&#233;s pour la r&#233;alisation
d'un d&#233;veloppement durable. C'est en effet le Nord qui, en adoptant des mod&#232;les de production
et de consommation non durables, s'approprie une partie disproportionnellement &#233;lev&#233;e des
ressources de la plan&#232;te. De l'avis du Conseil, les probl&#232;mes d&#233;mographiques ne
devraient pas conduire, dans les relations de d&#233;veloppement, &#224; de nouvelles formes de
conditionnalit&#233; impos&#233;es unilat&#233;ralement, mais plut&ocirc;t &#224; un dialogue
d'&#233;gal &#224; &#233;gal.
<p>
Deux membres du Conseil, qui faisaient partie du groupe de travail charg&#233; de la pr&#233;paration de
l'avis, y souscrivent pour une grande partie, notamment au fait de transmettre activement, au Caire,
l'id&#233;e d'une strat&#233;gie &#233;tendue et consistante et l'offre d'approfondir, dans un avis
ult&#233;rieur, la mise en oeuvre pratique d'une politique d&#233;mographique large. Ces membres ont
toutefois des opinions divergentes sur un certain nombre de points, dont les principales peuvent se
r&#233;sumer dans les termes suivants:
<ul>
<li>Le principal probl&#232;me d&#233;mographique est, de loin, la persistance de la croissance. Des
probl&#232;mes tels que l'urbanisation et le vieillissement en sont des corollaires. Le probl&#232;me de la
croissance d&#233;mographique m&#233;rite donc une attention prioritaire.
<li>Les mesures recommand&#233;es par le Conseil ne suffiront vraisemblablement pas &#224;
att&#233;nuer l'ampleur du probl&#232;me de la d&#233;mographie. Aussi longtemps en tout cas que
subsiste une croissance d&#233;mographique rapide, il faut recourir &#224; tous les moyens acceptables
pour r&#233;duire cette croissance, parmi lesquels le paiement, sous certaines conditions, de primes aux
groupes cibles en vue de promouvoir un abaissement de la f&#233;condit&#233;.
<li>Il faut fixer des priorit&#233;s plus pr&#233;cises en particulier en ce qui concerne l'&#233;tendue
des mesures &#224; mettre en place pour le planning familial et l'information &#224; ce sujet.

<a name="howdev"><hr><b>How Developing Countries Trade: The Institutional Constraints </b>.
<i>Sheila Page </i>. Over the last fifteen years there have been dramatic increases in both private and
public intervention in international trade. Traditional barriers to market- based trade such as
commodity cartels and tariffs have been augmented by new developments such as the rise of regional
trade blocs and the growth of intra-firm trade. This book argues that these changes are large and
persistent enough to have an impact on total development performance, and on the performance of
both individual countries and sectors. It illustrates this with a wealth of theoretical arguments,
empirical evidence and country studies.(1994, price = &#163; 15.99). Order from: <a href="mailto:publications@odi.org.uk">publications@odi.org.uk</a></a>
<p>
<a name="trawit"><hr><b>Trading with South Africa: The policy options for the EC</b>. <i>Sheila
Page and Christopher Stevens </i>. Provides wide ranging analysis of South African trade
post-sanctions, detailing its current exports, and examining what types of external support South Africa
needs, and how South Africa and its trading partners can encourage new products and markets. It also
identifies which existing suppliers to the EC could be affected. The report compiles and analyses data
on South African trade, commodity data for all major trading partners, tariff and non-tariff data, and
competitiveness indicators. (1992, price &#163; 20.00). Order from: <a href="mailto:publications@odi.org.uk">publications@odi.org.uk</a></a>
<p>
<a name="wortra"><hr><b>World Trade Reform: Do Developing Countries Gain or Lose?</b>.
<i>Sheila Page and Michael Davenport</i>. The Uruguay Round of trade negotiations reduced barriers
to trade in all economic sectors, with the largest changes in food and clothing. An unprecedented
number of activities and government policies related to trade will come under international regulation
for the first time, as the move from GATT to the World Trade Organization creates a new institution
with stronger powers as well as wider responsibilities. For the developing countries the effects of this
new international framework are increased because their special privileges are defined more precisely,
but also more narrowly. Estimates of the consequences have varied from massive gains to crippling
losses. This Special Report analyses the changes and where possible quantifies them. It sets out their
impact on a range of countries at different stages of development. Finally it considers how the new
trading system may need to evolve to meet its increasing responsibilities. (1994, price = &#163; 17.50). Order from: <a href="mailto:publications@odi.org.uk">publications@odi.org.uk</a></a>
<p>

<a name="eurpre"><hr><b>Europe's Preferred Partners? The Lom&#233; Countries in World Trade </b>.
<i>Michael Davenport, Adrian Hewitt and Antonique Koning</i>. Countries in Africa, the Caribbean
and the Pacific (ACP) have enjoyed preferential access to the European Market under the Lom&#233;
Convention for over twenty years. This report assesses the impact of their special treatment, examines
in detail their trade performance and investigates the difficulties that ACP exporters experience. The
Report also explores potential effects on ACP trade performance of changes in EU policy regarding
the Lom&#233; Convention and of trade liberalisation that resulted from the Uruguay Round. (1995, price 
&#163; 17.50). Order from: <a href="mailto:publications@odi.org.uk">publications@odi.org.uk</a></a>
<p>
<a name="crior"><hr><b>Crisis or Transition in Foreign Aid?</b> <i>edited by Adrian P Hewitt </i>.
Has the end of the Cold War caused a crisis in official aid, already  beset by budgetary cuts,
challenges on effectiveness and so called 'donor fatigue'? Or is the  problem specific to a few donors,
while others move ahead with more constructive policies,  stronger and broader-based public support,
and larger programmes? This Special Report assesses  the current position in ten of the leading donor
countries (UK, USA, Canada, Japan, France,  Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Denmark)
and looks to the future role of foreign  aid. (1994, price  &#163; 17.50). Order from: <a href="mailto:publications@odi.org.uk">publications@odi.org.uk</a></a>
<p>

<a name="foraid"><hr><b>Foreign Aid Reconsidered</b>. <i>Roger C Riddell</i>. Examines in depth
the moral and theoretical questions raised in the  aid debate and weighs up the different arguments in
the light of the range and quality of  current evidence.  '...the most thorough and authoritative analysis
of foreign aid that I have seen.  It is balanced and well argued and based on a broad range of relevant
sources. In the  literature on development, it is a landmark that no doubt will attract interest among
both academics  and professional aid administrators.' Goran Hyden author of No Shortcuts to Progress.
(1987, price  &#163; 14.95). Order from: <a href="mailto:publications@odi.org.uk">publications@odi.org.uk</a></a>
<p>
<a name="afrmul"><hr><b>Africa's Multilateral Debt A Modest Proposal</b>. <i>All Party Group
on Overseas Development</i>. Many African countries now see the lending policies of the World
Bank  and the IMF as an impediment to development rather than a help. What is the truth  behind this
perception? Should the international financial institutions now reverse their  policy of refusing to
reschedule or write off bad debts? Are our own governments bailing  out the IMF and the World Bank
with scarce bilateral aid to keep debts current and if so  should the donors be prepared to continue?
The Working Party has drawn up a framework of  recommendations after meeting representatives of
all points of view   banks, creditor  and debtor governments, as well as the international financial
institutions and independent  experts. (1994, price = &#163; 10.00). Order from: <a href="mailto:publications@odi.org.uk">publications@odi.org.uk</a></a>

pr&#233;sent&#233; &#224; M. Jan Pronk, ministre de la Coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement.</b>
<p>
<h3>Pr&#233;sentation de la probl&#233;matique </h3>

Les pays en d&#233;veloppement candidats &#224; des pr&ecirc;ts du Fonds
Mon&#233;taire International (FMI) et de la Banque Mondiale doivent accepter les conditions
pos&#233;es par ces organismes. Ces conditions font partie int&#233;grante des programmes
d'ajustement qui doivent &ecirc;tre mis en oeuvre par les pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires. Un
programme d'ajustement comprend un certain nombre de mesures &#233;conomiques visant
&#224; la restructuration de l'&#233;conomie nationale: ce sont des mesures
macro-&#233;conomiques. Parall&#232;lement, un grand nombre de pays donateurs
financent dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement des projets ax&#233;s sur
l'am&#233;lioration, au niveau local, de la situation de groupes sp&#233;cifiques: ce sont
des mesures micro-&#233;conomiques. Comme ces deux types de mesures ont des effets sur
la situation au micro-niveau, il inmporte de les harmoniser, faute de quoi l'efficacit&#233; de
la politique d'aide au d&#233;veloppement sera compromise, et il n'est pas impensable que
puissent survenir des effets non d&#233;sir&#233;s sur la lutte contre la pauvret&#233;.
<p>
Le Conceil constate dans son avis que cette harmonisation est insuffisante. Il s'interroge donc
sur la fa&#231;on de parvenir &#224; une meilleure harmonisation entre la politique des
pays donateurs au macro-niveau et au micro-niveau et sur les probl&#232;mes qui se posent
&#224; cet &#233;gard aux pays en d&#233;veloppement et aux pays donateurs. L'avis
&#233;tudie certains aspects du contexte dans lequel s'inscrit ce manque d'harmonisation et
&#233;met un certain nombre de recommandations pour y rem&#233;dier. Il examine, enfin,
les possibilit&#233;s de renforcement de la position des pays en d&#233;veloppement dans le
dialogue avec les pays donateurssur la politique de d&#233;veloppement.
<p>
<h3>Goulots d'&#233;tranglement</h3>

L'objectif des programmes d'ajustement est de r&#233;tablir &#224; court terme
l'&#233;quilibre entre les revenus et les d&#233;penses d'un pays par des mesures
&#233;conomiques au niveau national. &Agrave; plus long terme, ces programmes doivent
&#233;galement aboutir &#224; une restructuration &#233;conomique telle que les secteurs
prometteurs soient renforc&#233;s. Dans cette sorte de restructuration, les mesures &#224;
prendre se situent au niveau macro-&#233;conomique: r&#233;tablissement de
l'&#233;quilibre de la balance des paiements, ajustement des cours de change, limitation du
d&#233;ficit budg&#233;taire des pouvoirs publics, stimulation des investissements
productifs, am&#233;lioration du climat d'investissement, suppression des entraves au
march&#233;, mise en place d'une gestion convenable et d'une infrastructure de
qualit&#233;, etc. De telles mesures touchent des groupes socio-&#233;conomiques
tr&#232;s divers dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement. M&ecirc;me si les r&#233;actions
de ces groupes - paysans, commer&#231;ants ou salari&#233;s, par exemple - varient, elles
sont ensenble d&#233;terminantes pour l'effet final des mesures prises au niveau national.
<p>
L'autre forme d'aide - la mise en oeuvre de projets de d&#233;veloppement - est dans de
nombreux cas cibl&#233;e, au niveau des objectifs, sur des groupessp&#233;cifiques et sur
la situation locale dans laquelle ils se trouvent.Il semble donc &#233;vident que les
programmes d'ajustement et l'aide aux projets doivent &ecirc;tre harmonis&#233;s. L'avis
constate que cette harmonisation laisse encore &#224; d&#233;sirer.
<p>
<h4>Connaissance insuffisante des rapports socio-&#233;conomiques</h4>

Le manque d'harmonisation provient pour une large part de ce que l'harmonisation entre la
politique au niveau macro-&#233;conomique et la politique au niveau
micro-&#233;conomique est difficilement r&#233;alisable &#224; cause de la connaissance
insuffisante des rapports socio-&#233;conomiques. Il y a bien quelque chose &#224; dire,
pour un certain nombre de secteurs tels que l'agriculture, sur les effets de la politique
d'ajustement sur certains groupes socio-&#233;conomiques sp&#233;cifiques et sur leurs
r&#233;actions, mais cela ne d&#233;passe pas le cadre des g&#233;n&#233;ralit&#233;s.
Faire des pr&#233;visions plus pr&#233;cises sur les r&#233;actions de groupes
d&#233;termin&#233;s aux mesures d'ajustement rel&#232;ve &#233;galement,
jusqu'&#224; un certain point, de l'approximation. On peut admettre que les r&#233;actions
au niveau micro-&#233;conomique varient probablement aussi d'un pays &#224; l'autre et
d'une culture &#224; l'autre. La plupart des mod&#232;les &#233;conomiques sont trop
g&#233;n&#233;raux pour &ecirc;tre utilisables. Aussi le risque est-il grand - m&ecirc;me si
personne ne le souhaite - que certaines mesures &#233;conomiques restent sans effet ou aient
m&ecirc;me des effetspervers. Les pouvoirs publics des pays concern&#233;s ne disposent
souvent pas des donn&#233;es concr&#232;tes sur la situation locale, n&#233;cessaires pour
une analyse plus cibl&#233;e. Et les services qui devraient &ecirc;tre responsables de la
collecte de ces donn&#233;es ne disposent souvent pas des moyens n&#233;cessaires ni des
personnels qualifi&#233;s pour pouvoir remplir leur t&#226;che. De ce fait, les chances de
succ&#232;s d'une politique efficace de lutte contre la pauvret&#233;, ax&#233;e sur les
besoins sp&#233;cifiques de groupes donn&#233;s, sont minimes.
<p>
Dans le Rapport "Un monde de Diff&#233;rences", M. Jan Pronk, ministre de la
Coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement, souligne &#233;galement la
n&#233;cessit&#233; d'une connaissance et d'une compr&#233;hension en profondeur des
processus sociaux et pose la question de savoir quelles sont les cat&#233;gories de pauvres
&#224; distinguer.
<p>
<h4>Int&#233;r&ecirc;t des pays donateurs</h4>

Il n'est pas surprenant que les int&#233;r&ecirc;ts des pays donateurs tiennent une place
dans la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. Pourtant, ce facteur rend plus difficile
l'harmonisation aussi bien entre les pays donateurs qu'entre les donateurs et les pays
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires de les institutions financi&#232;res multilat&#233;rales d'aide au
d&#233;veloppement.
<p>
<h4>Influence excessive des donateurs dans l'&#233;laboration de la politique &#224; long
terme</h4>

Les pays en d&#233;veloppement manquant g&#233;n&#233;ralement de donn&#233;es et
de connaissances syst&#233;matiques sur leur propre situation socio-&#233;conomique, leurs
possibilit&#233;s de pr&#233;senter une politique &#224; long terme solidement
&#233;tay&#233;e sont limit&#233;es. Dans le d&#233;bat avec les pays donateurs sur les
mesures d'ajustement &#224; prendre, ces pays sont handicap&#233;s par ladifficult&#233;
&#224; formuler leur vision de leur propre avenir. Les pays donateurs s'empressent de les
d&#233;charger de cette t&#226;che et formulent eux-m&ecirc;mes une politique &#224;
long terme pour leur propre intervention dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement et ce,
g&#233;n&#233;ralement &#224; l'aide d'instruments insuffisamment adapt&#233;s &#224;
la situation locale et sur la base d'informations qui laissent &#224; d&#233;sirer.
<p>
<h3>Conclusions et recommandations</h3>

L'avis parvient &#224; la conclusion que les pays en d&#233;veloppement ne peuvent pas
faire entendre suffisamment leur voix dans l'&#233;laboration de la politique de
d&#233;veloppement &#224; long terme. Or, la politique du d&#233;veloppement
rel&#232;ve en premier lieu de la responsabilit&#233; des pouvoirs publics des pays en
d&#233;veloppement eux-m&ecirc;mes, les pays donateurs pouvant naturellement poser des
questions sur cette politique. Le NAR constate que l'incapacit&#233; relative des pays en
d&#233;veloppement &#224; formuler clairement une vision quant &#224; leur avenir est un
probl&#232;me fondamental. Les pays en d&#233;veloppement en sont souvent plus ou
moins r&#233;duits &#224; accepter des solutions &#233;manant de tiers et
fr&#233;quemment li&#233;es &#224; des conditions de financement et &#224; des
int&#233;r&ecirc;ts particuliers. Le succ&#232;s d'une politique accept&#233;e sous une
forte pression externe est incertain, car le pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire n'y adh&#232;re pas
r&#233;ellement. 
<p>
Ce probl&#232;me est partiellement li&#233; &#224; l'incapacit&#233; technique des
services concern&#233;s dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement. Aussi le Conseil
recommande-t-il de soutenir davantage ces pays dans l'&#233;laboration et la planification
de leur propre d&#233;veloppement sur la base de priorit&#233;s qu'ils fixent
eux-m&ecirc;mes, par exemple en renfor&#231;ant dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement les
services publics charg&#233;s des &#233;tudes et de la planification et ce, de
pr&#233;f&#233;rence dans le cadre d'une politique novatrice d'assistance technique et de
relations de coop&#233;ration de longue dur&#233;e, &#224; la condition toutefois que ces
pays m&#232;nent eux-m&ecirc;mes une politique ax&#233;e sur la lutte contre la
pauvret&#233;.
<p>
L'avis conclut qu'outre un probl&#232;me technique, il y a &#233;galement un manque
d'information scientifique sur les rapports socio-&#233;conomiques dans les
soci&#233;t&#233;s concern&#233;es. L'avis part d'une conception du fonctionnement de
l'&#233;conomie diff&#233;rente de celle commun&#233;ment adopt&#233;e en
macro-&#233;conomie. Une analyse plus pr&#233;cise permet d'int&#233;grer les
probl&#232;mes, objectifs et lignes directrices au niveau macro-&#233;conomique et des
objectifs sp&#233;cifiques en mati&#232;re de lutte contre la pauvret&#233;, de protection
de l'environnement, d'action en faveur de la population rurale ou citadine, d'acc&#232;s de
certains groupes &#224; l'enseignement, &#224; d'autres prestations sociales ou aux
ressources naturelles. Une analyse int&#233;grale est essentielle, tant dans la perspective de
la politique macro-&#233;conomique qu'en vue d'&#233;tayer les recommandations en
mati&#232;re de politique au micro-niveau. Or. il n'y a pas d'int&#233;gration,
jusqu'&#224; pr&#233;sent, dans l'analyse de l'ajustement structurel ni dans l'analyse des
probl&#232;mes sp&#233;cifiques des groupes, secteurs ou r&#233;gions. Une analyse
int&#233;grale n&#233;cessite en outre davantage de connaissances sur les r&ocirc;les
respectifs des hommes et des femmes, la r&#233;partition des t&#226;ches et la prise de
d&#233;cisions au sein des m&#233;nages. L'int&#233;gration fait d&#233;faut aussi bien
du c&ocirc;t&#233; des pays en d&#233;veloppement que du c&ocirc;t&#233; des donateurs
bilat&#233;raux et multilat&#233;raux. Mais des mod&#232;les permettant une analyse plus
efficace ont &#233;t&#233; &#233;labor&#233;s ou sont en voie d'&#233;laboration. L'avis
en cite quelques exemples.
<p>
Le Conseil recommande de recourir davantage &#224; des mod&#232;les d'analyse
int&#233;grale. Il conviendrait d'encourager la Banque Mondiale &#224; reprendre le
r&ocirc;le - qu'elle a jou&#233; autrefois - de pr&#233;curseur dans le domaine de l'analyse
politique.
<p>
Le Conseil conclut, comme le souligne le Rapport "Un Monde de Diff&#233;rences",
qu'une meilleure connaissance de la situation locale dans les pays avec lesquels sont
entretenues des relations de d&#233;veloppement est indispensable. Il recommande de
promouvoir la connaissance de la situation locale par la multiplicacion des &#233;tudes de
terrain dans les pays concern&#233;s. 
<p>
Il n'est pas toujours possible de disposer rapidement de donn&#233;es suffisantes pour
pouvoir prendre &#224; temps les mesures qui s'imposent dans une situation
impr&#233;vue. Aussi le Conseil recommande-t-il de mettre en place des syst&#232;mes
d'alerte (early warning systems) permettant de pressentir les perturbations graves du
sch&#233;ma normal, par exemple en ce qui concerne la moisson. Les efforts &#224;
d&#233;ployer pour l'acquisition de connaissances sp&#233;cifiques sur les pays peuvent
conduire &#224; une sp&#233;cialisation parmi les donateurs et permettre &#224; la CE de
jouer un r&ocirc;le sp&#233;cifique. 
<p>
Le probl&#232;me de l'harmonisation de la politique au macro-niveau et de la politique au
micro-niveau se manifeste &#233;galement dans l'&#233;laboration et la mise en oeuvre de
la politique de l'environnement. Seule une bonne connaissance du r&ocirc;le jou&#233; par
l'environnement au micro-niveau en tant que moyen pour des groupes sp&#233;cifiques de
subvenir &#224; leurs besoins permet une politique de l'environnement efficace, la lutte
contre la pauvret&#233; et la durabilit&#233; devant &ecirc;tre au centre des
pr&#233;occupations. Cette politique doit garantir un consensus quant &#224; la fa&#231;on
de combiner les diverses formes d'utilisation de l'environnement par les diff&#233;rents
utilisateurs. Le Conseilcraint que le choix de l'"option dure", aux termes de laquelle les
ressources naturelles non renouvelables ne doivent pas &ecirc;tre exploit&#233;es, ne
restreigne trop les possibilit&#233;s des pays pauvres de mener une v&#233;ritable politique
de lutte contre la pauvret&#233;. 
<p>
Le Conseil conclut que cela peut en particulier avoir des cons&#233;quences n&#233;gatives
pour les groupes les plus pauvres, dont l'acc&#232;s aux ressources naturelles est restreint.
<p>
Le Conseil recommande de ne pas exclure le remplacement des ressources naturelles par un
autre capital productif, sauf &#224; d&#233;montrer que la pr&#233;servation de certaines
ressources naturelles n'entrave pas la lutte contre la pauvret&#233;. La politique
macro-&#233;conomique (programmes d'ajustement notamment) doit &ecirc;tre
&#233;valu&#233;e dans ses effets sur les diff&#233;rents groupes socio-&#233;conomiques
et leur acc&#232;s aux ressources naturelles.
<p>
<h3>Autres recommandations</h3>

Le Conseil recommande d'ouvrir davantage de perspectives de b&#233;n&#233;fices
durables aux pays qui prennent r&#233;ellement au s&#233;rieux la mise en oeuvre d'un
programme d'ajustement structurel. Il cite, &#224; titre d'exemple, la cr&#233;ation d'une
zone mon&#233;taire du type de la zone franc en Afrique. 
<p>
Les investissements doivent &ecirc;tre adapt&#233;s &#224; la capacit&#233; de mise en
oeuvre des pouvoirs publics. Le Conseil recommande donc de se montrer moins directif dans
les investissements. Les pays donateurs doivent &#233;viter que de nouveaux projets de
d&#233;veloppement nuisent &#224; l'assainissement n&#233;cessaire entrepris par les pays
concern&#233;s. Si l'on accro&icirc;t le r&ocirc;le du m&#233;canisme du march&#233;,
les d&#233;cisions d'investissement peuvent &ecirc;tre davantage d&#233;centralis&#233;es.
L'identification et le soutien de projets de d&#233;veloppement peuvent alors &ecirc;tre
organis&#233;es davantage &#224; partir de la base.

<html><head><title>AFRICAN FOOTBALLERS TO LEAD HIV/AIDS AWARENESS CAMPAIGN</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="unicef_pix/unicef_logo.gif"><hr><br><h2>AFRICAN FOOTBALLERS TO LEAD HIV/AIDS AWARENESS CAMPAIGN</h2><p><b>6th February 1996:</b><p>Africa's leading footballers have teamed-up with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in its HIV/AIDS prevention and care campaign across Africa.<p>The campaign 'African Footballers Unite Against AIDS' was officially launched in Johannesburg at the African Nations Cup.  Amongst the players who have agreed to participate in the campaign are:<p>George Weah (Liberia)Abedi Pele Ayew (Ghana)Tony Yeboah (Ghana)Nii Lamptey (Ghana)Kalusha Bwalya (Zambia)Neil Tovey (South Africa)Doctor Khumalo (South Africa)<p>along with John Fashanu, the former England, Wimbledon and Aston Villa star, who is now a UNICEF UK Special Representative.<p>Although not able to be present at the launch, the FIFA, European and African Footballer of the Year, George Weah has agreed to lead the campaign, stating that he would lend his support in any way that will further the work of UNICEF with the children of the world.<p>The campaign is one element of a broad relationship being developed between footballers and football associations, as part of UNICEF's partnership in the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), according to Mr Ian MacLeod, from UNICEF in South Africa.<p>'As the number one sport in Africa - indeed, across the globe - football has the unique capacity to be able to reach out to millions of young men and women, and improve their understanding of health issues, especially the threat of HIV/AIDS,' said Mr MacLeod.<p>'The top players in each country are listened to by young men and women - they have great influence over their behaviour. Hopefully, these young people can be better informed about how to protect themselves against HIV/AIDS,' he said.<p>The programme between football associations and UNICEF/UNAIDS kicked off at the African Cup of Nations.  During the period of the Cup, in countries across Africa, activities have been organised bringing together youth organisations to watch and listen to the games and then to discuss health and pro-social issues.  During the games, media in many African countries are broadcasting and printing special messages for youth on HIV/AIDS, including some from football stars', said Mr MacLeod.<p>'UNICEF has been very fortunate that CAF have been supporting our work, in allowing us to have signboards at the games, and allowing us to meet with players and officials to increase their understanding of this major health concern, and how we can work together to stem the advance of HIV/AIDS' he said.<p>Dr Rob Moodie, a Director of UNAIDS who is based in Geneva, and in South Africa for the development of the initiative, reinforced the importance of football now taking up the issue of HIV/AIDS as a priority.<p>'In many parts of Africa between 10% and 20% of 15-24 year olds are already infected with the virus that leads to AIDS, HIV.  Every day it is estimated that there are over 4000 new infections across the continent - of which at least half are in this age group,' stated Dr Moodie.<p>'The African Footballers Unite Against AIDS initiative will be a catalytic factor in ensuring that the present and future generations across this vast continent are able to make informed decisions to ensure their own healthy development, and that of their families and communities,' said Dr Moodie.<p>'People with HIV live productive and fulfilling lives and continue to work and play sports for many years.  Just look at the basketball star, Magic Johnson.  We all have a responsibility in this era to show solidarity and to be supportive of HIV-infected people, giving them love and care, not prejudice and rejection'.<p>'We know that HIV prevention does work and can reduce infection rates.  Together with these football stars, we are taking up the challenge and working in unity towards a safer, stronger, and more economically dynamic Africa,' he said.<p><b>Note to Editors:</b><br>John Fashanu is currently visiting AIDs projects in Tanzania and will be available for interview on his return to this country the week beginning February 13th. There will also be Beta footage and photos available of his trip, filmed by ITV in Tanzania on his return.<p>Please contact Stacey Adams UNICEF UK Press Office on 0171 430 0162 or Deborah Valentine UNICEF Pretoria South Africa 00 27 12 320 7066/7/8/9<p><hr>©Copyright: UNICEF 1995<hr><a href="index.html" target="_parent"><img src="unicef_pix/unicef_logo2.gif"> Unicef Home Page</a></body></html>

<H2>La CIG de 1996: <BR>
quels enjeux pour la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE?
</H2>

<P>
Texte int&eacute;gral d'un article paru dans<I> Lom&eacute; 2000</I>,
no. 1, janvier 1996: page 3</CENTER> <HR>

<P>
A peine quatre ans apr&egrave;s la signature du Trait&eacute;
de Maastricht, l'Union europ&eacute;enne s'appr&ecirc;te d&eacute;j&agrave;
&agrave; le r&eacute;viser dans le cadre d'une conf&eacute;rence
intergouvernementale (CIG). La CIG, qui d&eacute;bute officiellement
le 29 mars 1996, r&eacute;pond essentiellement &agrave; deux exigences:
adapter la structure institutionnelle &agrave; un nombre croissant
d'Etats membres et revoir, comme stipul&eacute; par le Trait&eacute;
lui-m&ecirc;me, la politique ext&eacute;rieure et de s&eacute;curit&eacute;
commune (PESC). Alors que le TUE marquait un tournant dans la
politique de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement de l'UE,
en la dotant d'une  base juridique propre,  elle n'est pas &agrave;
l'ordre du jour de la CIG. Elle pourrait n&eacute;anmoins &ecirc;tre
affect&eacute;e par la place accord&eacute;e &agrave; la coh&eacute;rence
de l'action ext&eacute;rieure de l'UE.
<P>
En effet, en mati&egrave;re de relations ext&eacute;rieures, le
ton est &agrave; la coh&eacute;rence. Coh&eacute;rence au sein
de la politique de d&eacute;veloppement qui pourrait se traduire
par l'inclusion de la coop&eacute;ration ACP-UE dans une politique
de d&eacute;veloppement globale. Coh&eacute;rence, surtout, entre
les trois principales politiques externes de l'Union (politique
commerciale, coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement, PESC)
. 
<P>
Qu'elle se d&eacute;cline selon des &quot;int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts
europ&eacute;ens&quot; d&eacute;finis dans le cadre, plus intergouvernemental,
de la PESC ou qu'elle se fonde sur une clarification des t&acirc;ches
entre les trois principales politiques externes, une coh&eacute;rence
renforc&eacute;e comporte des risques pour la coop&eacute;ration
ACP-UE. 
<P>
Une instrumentalisation de la politique commerciale et de la coop&eacute;ration
au d&eacute;veloppement dans le cadre d'une politique ext&eacute;rieure
coh&eacute;rente, signifierait une subordination des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts
du d&eacute;veloppement &agrave; ceux politiques, s&eacute;curitaires
ou li&eacute;s &agrave; la politique d'immigration. Un partage
plus clair des t&acirc;ches confierait les questions politiques
strat&eacute;giques globales ainsi que les relations avec des
r&eacute;gions &quot;d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t commun&quot; comme
la M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e et l'Europe centrale &agrave; la
PESC, laisserait les relations &agrave; forte composante mercantile
sous la houlette de la politique commerciale et il ne resterait
plus &agrave; la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement que
les pays ACP et autres pays moins avanc&eacute;s.
<P>
A &eacute;viter donc pour les ACP: une spirale descendante par
laquelle ils repr&eacute;sentent de moins en moins un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
commun aux pays europ&eacute;ens et la marginalisation de la coop&eacute;ration
au d&eacute;veloppement. Et, par consequent, comment faudrait-il
agir? En articulant aussit&ocirc;t que possible leurs positions
vis-&agrave;-vis de l'UE, comme l'a sugg&eacute;r&eacute; l'ancien
premier ministre de Maurice.<HR>

<h2 align=center> NEW INITIATIVE  BRINGS CLEAN WATER TO HEBRON</h2>

<h4>12 February 1997</h4>



     
     Save the Children will launch a new project which will bring a regular 
     supply of
     clean water to children and their families in the South West bank 
     district of
     Hebron, (recent focus of Israeli- Palestinian negotiations) on 
     Wednesday 29
     January.<p>
     
     Funded with a grant of $400,000 from the Overseas Development 
     Administration,
     the project will also involve local communities in the establishment 
     of a low cost
     refuse collection and sewerage system. This will reduce the  risk of 
     environmental
     health hazards and diseases now commonplace in densely populated urban
     neighbourhoods and refugee camps in the region. The project will be 
     managed
     jointly by Save the Children UK and US.<p>
     
     Frances Moore, Save the Children's UK  Regional Adviser for the Middle 
     East, said:<p>
     <blockquote>
     "Year round supplies of clean water are a luxury for many families in 
     the West
     Bank. This critical water shortage is just one illustration of how 
     children of all
     communities have been deprived of the conditions required for a normal 
     healthy
     development."
     </blockquote><p>
     She added:<p>
     <blockquote>
     "This project arrives at a crucial time in Hebron's history. Although 
     the peace
     process and recent events have raised new hopes and expectations, for 
     most
     families, their economic and social  situation is actually 
     deteriorating."<p>
     </blockquote>
     
     Tomorrow 24 January as part of an official ministerial visit, the 
     British Overseas
     Development Minister Baroness Chalker will visit a similar ODA funded 
     water and
     sanitation programme run by Save the Children in Qalqilia district in 
     the north-
     eastern part of the West Bank.<p> 
     
     Save the Children is committed to strengthening Palestinian self 
     reliance and
     improving the quality of life for children in the West Bank and Gaza. 
     But it believes
     this will require long-term stability achievable only through progress 
     on the political
     issues outstanding in the region.<p>
     
 
                                
     
     
    <h4>NOTE TO EDITORS:</h4>
     
     1. Frances Moore, Save the Children's Middle East Adviser will be 
     attending the
     launch of the water resource development and environmental health 
     project in
     Hebron on Wednesday 29 January. To arrange interviews please contact 
     Save the
     Children press office.<p>
     
     2. Save the Children has been working in the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
     since
     1973.<p>

<html><head><title>Planned Parenthood Challenges 1996/1</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><img align=left hspace=3 src="../ippf_pix/ippf_logo.gif"><h3>International<br>Planned<br>Parenthood<br>Federation</h3><i>The material that follows has been provided by <a href="../ippf_info.html">IPPF</a></i><br clear=left><hr><h1 align=center>&quot;Backers of the people" in China</h1><h3 align=center>by Li Yang and Jeremy Hamand</h3><img align=left border=1 hspace=10 vspace=10 width=175 height=147 src="p25.jpg"><br><b>The human rights aspect of China's family planning programmeis constantly under attack by Western media and politicians,as are IPPF and the United Nations for providing support tofamily planning in China at all. Yet IPPF's affiliate inChina, the China Family Planning Association, performs avaluable role in representing people in the family planningprogramme against coercion or abuses by local officials andgenerally safeguarding their legal rights and interests.</b><p><font size=2>Collecting people's views on the family planning programme in Gongzhuling, Jilin Province</font><p><hr width=71%><p>The China FPA is different from family planning associationsin other countries. Like other organizations in this vastcountry, it is a 'mass organization', which means that thereis not a single FPA, but literally hundreds of thousands ofFPAs - at provincial, municipality, prefecture, county,township and village level.<p>The organization relies heavily on the services of unpaidvolunteers - numbered in tens of millions - who mainly do notprovide contraceptive services (that is done by theGovernment) but work in their own communities giving advice onfamily planning, child care and related family matters.<p>One of their main aims is to reduce the incidence of abortiondue to contraceptive failure, by ensuring that couplesunderstand the proper use of contraceptives and bycampaigning, where necessary, for a wider choice of methods.Another is to educate families on the value of girl children.The FPAs also generate practical help for couples, throughorganizing income-generating activities to reduce poverty andinsurance schemes to provide financial security in old age.<p><h3>Democratic supervision</h3>A major responsibility is to provide what is called'democratic supervision' - a function that is supported by theGovernment and has been repeatedly stressed by the FamilyPlanning Minister, Mrs Peng Peiyun. The China FPA has, shesays, "the responsibility of safeguarding the legal rights ofthe people, reflecting the demands and the voice of thepeople, and supervising that the officials of the Governmentact according to the law."<p>The basic aim is to ensure that individuals are fully informedof their rights and responsibilities in the family planningprogramme, and that these rights are respected. The FPAsencourage people to stand up for themselves and participate incommunity planning and improvement. While exercising thisfunction, the FPAs at all levels play a significant role bychannelling the people's comments, criticism and opinions tothe Government. The FPAs urge the government authorities toface up to any problems the people have with the familyplanning programme, and they point out inconsistencies in theprogramme and inaccuracies in the demographic data used.<p>The FPAs also monitor abuses by individual officials and urgethe authorities to eliminate all forms of abuse. TheGovernment is very sensitive to foreign accusations of abuseand coercion, and has laid down strict guidelines for theconduct of family planning programmes. Through internalregulations, it promulgates <i>Three Principles and SevenForbidden Acts.</i><p><blockquote><b>According to the <i>Three Principles</i>, stress should be laid on:</b><p><ol><li>  information and education rather than economic     disincentives;<li>   contraception rather than abortion<li>  day-to-day family planning management rather than     irregular campaigns.</ol><p><b>Under the <i>Seven Forbidden Acts</i>, the following are unlawfulactions in family planning programmes:</b><p><ol><li>   putting people in custody, beating them or     assaulting them<li>   destroying their possessions<li>  removing their possessions unlawfully<li>  imposing arbitrary charges penalties<li>   imposing penalties on relatives<li>  interfering with legal childbearing<li>   conducting pregnancy checks on young unmarried women.</ol></blockquote><p>But in such a huge country, monitoring of such regulations isnot easy. And even if individuals know of the existence ofthese guidelines, they may well feel too vulnerable to reportabuses themselves. Hence the importance of the 'democraticsupervision' function of the FPAs.<p><h3>Quality and choice</h3>Another valuable aspect of FPA involvement is quality controlof family planning services: any cases which infringetechnical quality standards and jeopardize people's health andsafety are reported to the authorities. They also look out forinadequate choice in their local programme. In DalianMunicipality, in the North-east, the family planning programmerelied only on IUDs and sterilization until 1991. The localFPA convinced officials that a better choice of methods wouldlead to a higher acceptance rate by the population - and thisproved to be the case.<p>In Jilin Province, the FPAs at all levels in GongzhulingMunicipality have gained a reputation as 'backers of thepeople' for their work representing the people who participatein the family planning programme.<p>The main approaches by Gongzhuling FPAs to their supervisionof the family planning programmes include:<p> <li>Collecting and consolidating the FPA members'     perspectives and ideas from the members' General     Assembly, meetings of their Councils and from individual     members;<li>Carrying out special studies and submitting reports with     recommendations to the government authorities;<li>Participating in the planning and implementation of the     approved programmes modified according to FPA proposals.<p>An example of the cases that the FPAs take up and resolve wasa local government ruling on collecting fines from coupleswith unplanned births and making bonus payments to finecollectors in a rural township. The FPA challenged some of thestipulations as being likely to lead to coercive practices.They urged the authorities to emphasize persuasion andpublicity rather than fine collection, and consider thespecial difficulties of some individuals. The townshipgovernment accepted this recommendation and there was nofurther opposition to the ruling.<p><h3>Local ruling</h3>People's rights and privileges are also closely monitored. Inone township last year FPA members found that in some villagesthe one-child health care fee, an incentive payment made toone-child families, had not been paid, and they quickly hadthis remedied by the authorities.<p>Over the past two years, the FPAs at all levels in Gongzhulingtrained 52,410 FPA council members, staff and volunteers toimprove their capacity and performance in democraticparticipation and supervision.<p>In Fujian Province in South China the FPA of Minhou County hasmade an agreement with the local authorities to authorize over3,000 FPA members to be responsible for monitoring theperformance of the family planning programme.<p>Taking the advice of the FPA that information and educationshould be the priorities in the family planning programme, theGovernment mobilized all possible media, including newspapers,magazines, radio, television, exhibitions and posterpublicity, to carry more family planning information so as tohelp the people to make an informed and responsible choice inplanning their families.<p>Through its supervising members' network, the FPA has beensupervising the performance of the government personnel at alllevels, to eliminate any possible abuses. Special letter boxesare in place throughout the county where people can post theircomments confidentially, and the people's concerns areregularly consolidated and passed on to the relevantauthorities for follow-up action.<p>The FPA has also urged the authorities to ensure thatincentives are given in the form of preferential assistance tofamily planning acceptors. The county government has providedspecial maternal and child health services to over 50,000women of reproductive age and all their children up to the ageof eight, and allocated 3.5 million yuan (over $450,000) to set upspecial insurance schemes for one-daughter families, such aschild safety insurance and family planning pension insurance.<p>The FPA asked the authorities for policy support for incomegeneration projects (home processing, home farming, animalrearing and community services) for young couples planningtheir families. These income generation projects are helpingshift people's concept of childbearing from 'the importance ofhaving sons for support in old age' to 'being self-sufficientfor retirement'.<p>In some places it may happen, through official inertia orignorance of the regulations, that people do not receivebenefits due to them. FPA investigators in a county inLiaoning Province found that people were not receiving theeconomic incentives promised in local policies; they raisedthe matter with the local government which, as a result,ensured that all incentives were awarded and also introducedan old age insurance scheme for one-child families. Lack ofreliable life insurance for old age is a major reason for somerural families wanting more children.<p>Local officials sometimes draft regulations designed to servetheir own ends rather than further government policy. In apoor mountainous county in Shandong Province with an annualper capita income of US$30, the local government hadintroduced a draconian penalty system for couples who had toomany children. People complained to the FPA who suggested tothe local government that the emphasis should be changed fromcollecting fines to helping the people to generate income, andwithin two years the FPAs in the county started more than2,000 income-generating projects, using local reservoir waterresources for fishery and growing and processing fruit.<p>In these and many other ways, the China FPA is playing animportant role in enhancing democracy, improving choice andcombating poverty in the country's rapidly changing economicand social environment. <hr><p>©Copyright IPPF<br><font size=-1>Picture: &copy;China FPA </font><hr><img align=left src="../ippf_pix/ippf_logo2.gif"> <a href="index.html">PPC 1996/1 Contents</a><br><a href="../index.html">IPPF Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

The populationof Tanzania is still predominantly based in rural areas, and still largelyreliant on subsistence farming for day to day survival.  <BR><BR>From 1970 President Nyerere established  a programme of villagisation, whichencouraged subsistence farmers in remote parts of the country to resettlein population clusters where they could be more easily reached with socialservices. Although unpopular at the time it  certainly helped the developmentof Tanzania's extensive social services programme. <BR><BR>Following villagisation, in the late 1970s UNICEF's new Basic Services Strategysupported efforts to: provide improved water schemes to more than half thecountry's villages; construct thousands of primary schools and health centres,and train teachers and healthworkers. Sadly, life for many Tanzanians isprobably worse now than it was 20 years ago. As in so many countries, repaymentof the national debt and introduction of economic austerity measures isrestricting funds available for health and education, which has meant thatthese services are inadequate and deteriorating.<BR><BR>Nyerere retired in 1985 and was followed by President Mwinyi (facing electionsin October '95) but much of the administrative structure remains the same.<BR>Tanzania has a pyramid administrative structure (see diagram below). A similarstructure has been developed in Zanzibar. This facilitates delivery of theCSPD programme. <BR>The CSPD programme began in the mid-1980s. It is now active in 12 out ofthe 20 mainland Regions as well as Zanzibar, reaching almost half the population.The programmes in two of  Mwanza Region's six districts, and Zanzibar, wherewe visited, are completely supported by UNICEF, largely through donationsfrom the UK Committee. UNICEF supports the CSPD programme in 50 of the 104Districts. Other donors to UNICEF include the government ministries of:Sweden (SIDA), Norway (Norad) and the Netherlands.<BR><BR>A major part of the CSPD programme is the establishment of systems for planning,delivering and monitoring services at community level. Each village selectstwo village health workers - a man and a woman. Every village has a villagegovernment structure of elected members, supported by a government representativewho will live in the village but not originate from the village. This personfeeds village decisions into Ward level meetings. The selected health workersare crucial to the success of the CSPD programme. They need to be stablemembers of the village, reliable and trustworthy with a primary level education.They receive two months training. One of them may already be a traditionalbirth attendant.<BR><BR>The village government sets up four committees: health, water and sanitation,finance and village safety and security, which are overseen by the villageleaders. (See the data for Kashishi Village, page 14, for example of thedecisions made by village government.)<BR><BR>The two health workers keep registers of all families/householders, childrenand their health records. Education extension staff from the Ward leveloversee pre-school and primary education. Every village has at least oneprimary school and a school committee of parents and teachers. Secondaryschools are at District level and children often have to board.<BR><H3>CSPD in Mwanza Region</H3><BR>Mwanza Region - population<BR><BR>Region 	- population 	1.7 million<BR>District 	- population 	2-300,000<BR>Division 	- population 	50-70,000<BR>Ward 	- population 	10-15,000<BR>Village 	- population 	2-3,000<BR><BR><BR>The CSPD programmes in Geita and Sengerema, two Districts with high populationdensity, started in June 1992.<BR><BR>First the programme was discussed with Regional authorities, who are governmentofficials, and District Councils, who were enthusiastic about the prospectof this integrated approach to community development. The first year wasspent mobilising local leaders and communities so that they would understandtheir responsibilities within the programme, and that of the supportingagencies like UNICEF and non-governmental organisations working in the Region.<BR><BR>With acceptance of the programme came 'capacity building', i.e. training,research, putting equipment and supplies in place. UNICEF provided the followingto Geita District which has 76 villages:<BLOCKQUOTE>155 bicycles - for village health workers<BR>12 motorcycles - for 13 Ward offices<BR>2 motor vehicles (Toyota Landcruiser and Hilux) - at Regional and Districtlevel<BR>56 weighing scales (hanging)<BR>62 weighing scales (standing)<BR>78 file folders<BR>196 registers for recording information<BR>20, 679 growth monitoring cards<BR>41 birth attendant kits<BR>147 Village health workers kits <BR>147 drug kits </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Every village has a village health day once a month when mothers come tothe health centre with their young children for weighing and vaccinationin a systematic growth monitoring programme. UNICEF provides regular suppliesof vaccine which are kept cold in UNICEF supplied kerosene fuelled refrigerators- the government supplies the kerosene. The vaccination programme is a nationalprogramme and takes place throughout the country.<BR><H3>The Child Survival, Protection and Development Programme is dividedinto six main areas:</H3><BR><B>Community mobilisation</B>, participation and management involves raisingawareness of health, nutrition, education and community development issuesin the village. It helps communities to assess the situation, analyse thecauses of the problems and take action for solutions - a process known asthe Triple A approach  to problem solving.  Communities gather informationon their social problems such as child malnutrition and manage their initiatives.<BR><BR><B>Adequacy of food intake</B> is a concept used to describe efforts toensure that women and children get enough of the right kind of food, whichentails improving feeding practices and the availability of food.<BR><BR><B>Child development and education</B> aims to improve the quality of earlychild care and basic education through greater community involvement inthe management of day-care centres and primary education. It supports trainingfor teachers, childcare centre attendants and members of village and schoolcommittees.<BR><BR><B>Health, water and sanitation</B> rest on the principle that clean waterand good health are inseparable. The CSPD programme provides support forcommunities to improve and manage health and water and sanitation systemsthemselves.<BR><BR><BR><B>Income-generating activities</B> are designed to alleviate poverty, oneof the most basic causes of malnutrition.

IGC 1996 -- What's at Stake?</h2>
<p>
Full text of an article from <i>Lom&#233; 2000</i>, No. 1, January 1996: page 3</h4>
</center>
<hr>
  Four years after the Maastricht Treaty, the EU is convening  an intergovernmental conference
  (the so-called "IGC") to revise it. Officially due to begin on 29 March 1996, the IGC aims to
  adapt the institutional structure of the EU to an increase in Member States and to revise the
  EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) as stipulated by the Treaty. Whilst the
  Maastricht treaty constituted a benchmark for EU development policy (by providing a legal
  base for it), it is not, so far, on the agenda of the IGC. It could, however, be affected by the
  quest of the IGC for coherence in external policies.
  <p>
  Indeed, the search for coherence in external relations is now the buzz word. Within
  cooperation policy itself, coherence could imply incorporating ACP-EU relations in a broader
  EU cooperation policy.  However, it is a broader coherence between the three sets of external
  policy (trade, development cooperation and CFSP) that is of primary concern to European
  policy-makers. Coherence can be enhanced by defining common goals to which all external
  policies aim, or by designing a clear task division between the three areas of external policy.
  In both cases, regardless of the benefits that coherence can bring to an incipient European
  foreign policy, it does pose some threats to ACP-EU cooperation. The first scenario, in which
  common goals or interests would be defined  within CFSP, would most likely lead to an
  instrumentalisation of development cooperation in which it is subordinated to political,
  security or immigration concerns. On the other hand, a clear division of tasks would
  incorporate strategic and political questions including relations with areas of "common
  interest" (Mediterranean or Eastern Europe) within CFSP, give trade policy overall
  responsibility for economic sets of relations (Latin America, South East Asia) and reduce
  development policy to cooperation with the ACP and other least developed countries. 
  <p>
  In both cases, the ACP should avoid the dangerous situation in which they would not be seen
  to represent any common European interest. Only by demonstrating a central position in
  European foreign and economic policy can a marginalisation of development cooperation be
  avoided. It would therefore be wise for the ACP to articulate, as soon as possible, their
  positions towards the EU, as has been suggested by the former Prime Minister of Mauritius.

The Domesday Book 2000 <i>by Roger Heape</i>

</h3>

In 1085 William the Conqueror was the only landowner in England. All the others were mere tenants and William needed to know who they were, what title they held to land and what it was worth for taxation purposes. Hence the Domesday book, which recorded details of all the 13,418 hamlets and villages.

<p>

In the next 800 years there were significant changes in land ownership. The church and monasteries acquired vast swathes of the country. The dissolution of the monasteries in the middle ages transferred much land to noble families and friends of the King. 

<p>

By the mid-nineteenth century land ownership had become a political issue - 'the land question'. Following the 1861 census the radical, John Bright, claimed that 'fewer than 150 men own half the land of England'.

<p>

The idea of a new Domesday Book in the form of a national inventory of land, was first raised by the statistician FP Fellowes when addressing the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1871. In the Lords a year later Lord Derby, responding to political pressure on the land question, proposed compiling a Domesday Book. Lord Halifax, on behalf of the government, declared a readiness to publish such a return based on parish valuation lists.

<p>

Four years later information had been gathered from 15,000 parishes and 5 million parochial assessments. This was arranged by county with owners listed alphabetically giving the extent of land and estimated gross rental.

<p>

<center><blockquote><B>In 1876, 710 landowners owned one quarter of England and Wales...</B></blockquote></center>

<p>

The returns showed that outside London nearly 1 million people owned amounts of land. Further classification was carried out in great detail by John Bateman who, in 1876, published his work 'Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland' - listing those people with holdings over 3,000 acres. This showed a huge concentration of ownership with 710 landowners owning one quarter of England and Wales. In some counties the concentration was even greater. In Dorset, for example, 34 landowners owned nearly 60% of the county.

<p>

Since Bateman's work there has been no further inventory of land ownership. Individual ownership has become veiled in secrecy. Government agencies, private companies, local authorities, successful business men and foreign investors have joined the ranks of the aristocracy as significant landowners. The prevailing wisdom is that land ownership is now much more diverse. Yet, who really knows?

<p>

Obtaining such information is difficult. The Land Registry has details of who a particular piece of land is owned by if it changed hands in the last 70 years. But there is no easily available record of total land owned by an individual.

<p>

The year 2000 presents a superb opportunity to produce another Domesday Book. Such a project would give a fascinating insight into the social power structure of Britain today. It would give vital information to organisations like The Land is Ours for campaigning purposes. Historians would be able to compare patterns and individual ownership with both Bateman's late nineteenth century book and the original Domesday Book itself.

<p>

How can such a project be carried out? There is, in fact, a project underway called Domesday 2000. This is being sponsored by Capital and Counties plc and carried out by Professor Peter Dale of University College, London. This aims to set up a national land information system. It will be possible for a person to refer to any piece of land and find out who owns it, linking in to the land database of Her Majesty's Land Registry.

<p>

However, it will not normally be possible to see all the land belonging to a Mr X, since this is deemed personal information and may be covered by data protection acts.

<p>

Surely a project as significant as a new Domesday Book would justify such access. Failing this it is even possible that landowners would want the prestige of appearing in such a publication.

<p>

Who would carry out such a study? Academic institutes clearly are the ideal places. Universities such as East Anglia have already produced publications on Norfolk land ownership.

<p>

To help fund such a venture the Millennium Fund itself could be approached. A modern Domesday Book would be a fitting publication to have at the end of the twentieth century and the end of the millennium.

<a name="sams"></a><h3>TLIO Peasants <i>by Sam Smith</i></h3>





My understanding of French countryside policy is this - country people are paid to stay there. That is, people on 'uneconomical' small farms have their farm incomes subsidised by the French government. The Germans have a similar policy, or so I have heard British farmers complain (not about their own lack of subsidy, but of what they perceive as unfair competition).

<p>

If such are their policies, then my sympathies lie with the French and German governments. I have to say immediately that both countries' policies grew from a very different historical background to that of Britain's.



<center><blockquote><B>People living and working in the countryside are not kicking their heels, or somebody's granny, in a decayed inner city.

</B></blockquote></center>

Like Tolstoy and Picasso, and along with John Berger, I am a proponent of the peasant existence - in all its harshness and simplicity. I believe, despite knowing that a peasant's can be a brutalising life, that the peasantry form the bedrock, the base measure, the touchstone, of all civilisations. A peasantry is a civilisation's contact with the soil, with the climate; a peasantry keeps civilisation rooted in reality, feeds back the effects that that civilisation is having on the soil, on the climate.

<p>

Every civilisation is an artificial self-generating creation. Should any civilisation lose contact with the land then its own reality loses its context. French and German politicians once, happily, realised this, and then they artificially maintained their peasantry.

<p>

However that peasantry is maintained, its value remains the same. A peasantry also, being useful as a base measure, makes social sense. People living and working in the countryside are not kicking their heels, or somebody's granny, in a decayed inner city.

<p>

So let's go to it - my utopian answer to all of Britain's ills.

<p>

We have never really had a peasantry in Britain. We went from the feudalism of Lords and Squires to enclosures, industrialisation, and on to the dump that is Tory Britain today. Thus the British have always seen owned space as a static measure of riches. Appearances are always predominant in Britain. Those prestigious countryside acres were used to create riches so that their owners could purchase large city properties with which they could impress other city slickers.

<p>

The exploitation and neglect of their distant estates eventually led to the formation of Agricultural Colleges where, initially, 'good husbandry' was extolled. By the 1950s though, land management had become the 'agricultural industry'; and the profitable exploitation of all remotely arable land became its manager's priority. Even in the late 1980s Sunday supplements continued to carry adverts showing a green pastoral scene with the caption 'The Factory Floor'.



<center><blockquote><B>...all county councils with a minimum of so many acres under cultivation would have to purchase a fifth of that land and convert it into 15 acre lots

</B></blockquote></center>

Behold today those rustics in their baggy blue boiler suits, diesel-stained, red-wristed, tending their excessively green fields in goggles and mask. These, our latter-day yeomen, are chemical technicians who are owned by the banks and have the gall to call themselves farmers. (One of my neighbours developed an allergic cough and was advised by her doctor to move into a town away from the pollution).

<p>

Last September, in Somerset, I watched a 'farmer' spray his potato crop with some chemical to deliberately kill off the green tops. This would make it easier for another of his machines to harvest the crop, which would then be sprayed to stop sprouting while in store. I decided then and there that the world had truly lost its senses.

<p>

Many farmers are already seeing visible and undeniable evidence under their own noses - nitrate poisoning in streams; pesticide poisoning cases growing daily - and they are losing their wholly exploitative attitude to the countryside. But not all. Side by side are farms where one farmer still grubs up hedgerows and continues to use a pesticide a season, while his neighbour is trying other methods. He is planting tree windbreaks and wildlife corridors, is letting livestock out of the sheds and into the fields, and is actively seeking non-chemical methods of husbandry.

<p>

The latter farmers, however, remain in the minority. Most farmland, I believe, has therefore to be taken away from the banks and the chemical companies and returned to its proper status as a vital resource of the nation, its food basket and spiritual heartland.

<p>

Unfortunately the present crop of Parliamentary politicians are people without vision, mere defenders of sectional interests. Not one of their sectional interests is the land itself; and what is needed now is radical land reform.

<p>

Britain is already a land of gardeners. (Gardens too, are a measure of a civilisation, an indicator of its denizens' subconscious attempts to make reparation for the ravages caused by their civilisation.) What I propose though, is more than gardening. What I want to see is a peasantry created in Britain. It's not likely, because it would not only require politicians with nerves of steel, but also the capitalist heresy of compulsory purchase.

<p>

(I dismiss politicians, but the idea might well be attractive to them. Nationalist politicians have always made use of the peasantry. No one knows and loves/hates their bit of land more than a peasant, and no one defends their bit of land more zealously than a peasant. On the other hand, a capitalist government does have good cause to fear a peasantry. All the communist revolutions, in Russia, China and Cuba, were supported by the peasantry. That, I hasten to add, is not a direct result of having a peasantry, but of having a lousy government.)



<center><blockquote><B>No, I want the scheme directed at the urban unemployed ...

</B></blockquote></center>

Once given the political will, the compulsory purchase of land would be a simple matter of administration. It could be done by saying that all County Councils with a minimum of so many acres under cultivation would have to purchase a fifth of that land and convert it to 15 acre lots.

<p>

The face of any countryside given over to the new peasantry would be drastically altered. Sites of Special Scientific Interest and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty would therefore be exempt from the acreage count.

<p>

On each of the 15 acre sites the commissioning County Council would be obliged to install a two bedroom mobile home, cesspit and power generator (wind or cesspit methane powered). The new peasants would then be given a basic set of tools, a choice of crops, and - on the equivalent of unemployment benefit - left to get on with it. (And it can be done. I did it. Covertly. Happily. For 5 years.)

<p>

I have no illusions about countryside living: most of the time it's wet and smelly and the only company is some red-necked yokels who want to kill things. I know, therefore, that co-operation among new peasants would be based, not on idealism but on necessity. Self-interest would have them banding together the better to market their produce, ferry their children to school, etcetera.

<p>

I would hope that, whilst not wanting to lay down too many preconditions, there would be proscriptions on what these new homesteaders would be allowed to do with their 15 acres. No chemicals, for instance, a limit to the amount of land under polythene or glass, strict limits on the size and number of outbuildings, no converting the holding to a holiday campsite or safari park, etcetera.

<p>

The initial result would be, I hope, that young couples and children would return to the countryside, and that village schools and shops would be reopened. The repopulated land, being revitalised, would attract others. And I don't mean those who would tastefully convert the barn and then commute to the nearest conurbation; but populated by people in working clothes, walking about the land, having even minor triumphs a la Balzac....

<p>

Nor would I be pleased if only middle class hobbyists dabbles in the scheme. I don't want to see yet more Home Counties, where the few fields are token fields - for the grazing of round bellied ponies or a few fat decorative sheep. Pastime places, with woodlands for playgrounds - Oh goody, lets play Pooh sticks.

<p>

No, I want the scheme directed at the urban unemployed, want to see the land worked again by people who will marvel yearly at the miracle of germination, by people with their fingers crumbling their own unique soil, hands in their backs looking with fulsome satisfaction upon an acre of newly turned earth....

<p>

In these new communities, craft workshops - studio, tap and stove - similarly subsidised, could also be instituted. People are happiest  when making or growing things. And all these people will have friends and relatives back in the cities. So the message will be carried back there - being and doing are more important than having.

<p>

I do not claim that the cities will be depopulated by such a scheme, nor that every other of Britain's problems will be solved. (We're already two generations too deep in the excrement for single solutions.) The problems with this scheme itself will come when the first generation, the voluntary peasants, have passed, and their country children inherit the plot and its labours. By then though they'll be the ones seeking new solutions for new problems.

<p>

Could Britain create such a peasantry?

<p>

The first large step would require us, as a society, to put people first, to place them before the ownership of land, before the pursuit of riches or the following of economic dogmas. Were that to happen, we'd maybe have no need of a new peasantry; all would naturally follow.

<p>

Here though, I've just been considering only land reform; and I ask you finally, to just imagine a land, where the majority of people dwelt in the countryside and the cities were not places of dread, not dustbins of inadequates, but centres of excellence.

<p>

Dream on.

<title>Europe - ACP Development Policies from a Maastricht Perspective</title>

<hr>
<H3><center><A HREF = "../index.html"><IMG SRC  =

Coordinate or be Coordinated:<br>Europe - ACP Development Policies from a Maastricht Perspective
<br>
<i>Louk Box and Paul Goodison</i><p></h3>
<h5>(Summary of Box, L. and P. Goodison. 1994. Coordinate or be coordinated: Europe - ACP development
policies from a Maastricht perspective. In: Coordinating the development aid policies of European
countries, edited by J.L. Rhi-Sausi and M. Dass&#249;. Rome: Centro Studi di Politica Internazionale.)
<p>
<a
href="../prog4/p4pub.htm">For related ECDPM publications</a></h5>
</center><p>
<hr>
For decades, the call for coordination in European development policy making has been heard.
Although certain forms of policy coordination have emerged, especially under the Convention of
Lom&#233;, only a beginning has been made. With the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty on 1 November
1993, a new phase in the coordination debate was reached. This Treaty specifies under its Title XVII that the "Community and the Member States shall coordinate their policies on development cooperation."
<p>
The question is: who coordinates what, where and why? Since the general principle of subsidiarity
   does not immediately apply to these forms of coordination and 'complementarity' does, the situation
is even less clear than in other areas of European cooperation. Since, moreover, no clear design, old or new, seems to lie yet at the basis of EC development cooperation in the 1990's, the question must be asked: what forms of coordination have emerged over the past decade, what lessons can be drawn and what implications does this have for the future coordination of European development policies? 
<p>
In this paper, we focus on the experience with the Lom&#233; Convention and the countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP).
<p>
We limit ourselves to the problem of coordination in Europe - ACP development cooperation. This
has two reasons: the availability of a recently published descriptive study on EC development
cooperation, and the fact that the coordination issue by itself is sufficiently important to warrant a
separate paper. We argue that the positive experiences with Lom&#233; Convention form the basis for
coordination between Europe and poor countries, provided institutional development takes place in
these countries allowing for partnership... and institutional development takes place in Brussels
allowing policy coherence. Provided, as well, that the Maastricht Treaty is elaborated to guide internal
European coordination and that the notion of complementarity is defined much more clearly in relation
to development cooperation. Provided, finally that the aims of European development policies are
reduced to come into line with the limited institutional resources it can muster.
<p>
<h3>Conclusion: A National Base is Still Lacking</h3>
<p>
What comes through quite clearly from the experience of programming under the Lom&#233; Convention
is: 
<ul>
<li>the extent to which potentially it could facilitate coordination of Community and Member States programmes in individual ACP countries;

<li>the relative inability of many ACP Governments, particularly in Africa, to play the lead role in determining the utilisation of development assistance resources in the context of coherent national development strategies, which the programming exercise places upon them;

<li>the relatively weak capacity of the Commission to actually coordinate with EC Member states and the other major providers of funds when considering the deployment of Lom&#233; resources in support of recipient led development strategies and programmes.

<li>In certain countries and in certain important areas, such as the utilisation of Counter-part Funds, the
Commission services have provided a lead in the initiation of coordinated action. 
However, this has largely been the consequence of dedicated action by individual civil servants and
the "right" personal chemistry between key actors. Only if the capacity of ACP Governments is
increased to lead the programming exercise is the programming process likely to provide a focus for
the coordinated deployment of available resources in a more effective manner.
<p></ul>
The European Commission could give consideration to assisting in this process by:
<ul><p>
<li>paying more attention to operationalising policy priorities in the social and economic
     circumstances pertaining in individual ACP countries and sub-regions of the ACP; 

<li>reviewing the relationship between Delegations and headquarters;

<li>giving priority to strengthening the Delegations capacity to exploit existing instruments in a coherent and systematic manner consistent with policy priorities and in a manner relevant to local economic and social circumstances;

<li>redefining the role of the Delegate to move away from project administration towards policy dialogue and appropriate programme design.

The objectives of bilateral aid, structural adjustment and donor policy</h2>
<h4><i>NAR Secretariat</i>
<p>
Source: <i>In Brief: Information from the NAR</i><br>No. 1, February 1992</h4>
<h5>The full text of the report in English, as well as a list of other publications, are available free of
charge from the Council's secretariat: E-mail: nar-dgis@dgis.minbuza.nl</h5>
</center>
<hr>
<b>The 98th report of the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) on the
relationship between the bilateral aid policies of donor countries and structural adjustment policy was
presented to the Minister for Development Cooperation, J P Pronk, on 27 February 1992.</b>
<p>
<h3>Summary of the problems and the questions explored in the report</h3>

Developing countries which wish to receive loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank have to agree to the conditions laid down by these institutions. These conditions are part of the
"adjustment programmes" which the recipient countries are expected to implement. An adjustment
programme is a package of economic measures designed to restructure the national economy, in other words
macroeconomic measures. Many donor countries also finance projects in developing countries, the purpose
of which is to improve the situation of particular sections of the population at local level. Such projects are
described in economic jargon as designed to operate at "micro-level". Since both the macroeconomic
measures contained in adjustment programmes and projects affect the situation at micro-level, these two
forms of development aid need to be coordinated. Otherwise, the effectiveness of aid policy is likely to be
undermined and efforts to reduce poverty may conceivably suffer a setback.
<p>
The report indicates that the level of coordination is less than satisfactory and raises the question of how
coordination of the macro and micro-policies of donors can be improved and what problems this presents for
developing countries and donors. Some of the reasons for the lack of policy coordination are explored and a
number of suggestions are made for remedying the situation. Finally, attention is turned to the matter of
how to strengthen the position of developing countries in the policy dialogue with donors.
<p>

<h3>Problems</h3>

The purpose of an adjustment programme is to redress the balance between a country's income and its
revenue by means of a number of economic measures at national level. In the longer term it should also
bring about a restructuring of the economy to the benefit of those sectors in which there is room for growth.
An operation of this kind involves what are known as "macroeconomic" measures, such as improving the
balance of payments, altering the rate of exchange, reducing the public spending deficit, stimulating
productive investment, improving the investment climate, eliminating market restrictions, ensuring proper
government, creating a sound infrastructure, etc. Measures of this kind affect many different sections of the
population and the reaction of the different socioeconomic groups (farmers, traders, employees, etc.) varies.
It is the sum total of all these reactions which determines the ultimate effect of measures taken at the
national level.
<p>
The other form of aid mentioned above - development projects - is very often geared to specific groups and
the particular circumstances in which they live. It would seem logical therefore to coordinate adjustment
programmes on the one hand and project aid on the other. The report indicates that coordination is not as
effective as it should be.
<p>
<h4>Lack of understanding of socioeconomic implications</h4>

One important reason for this mentioned in the report is a lack of understanding of the socioeconomic
implications, which hinders the coordination of macro and micro-policies in the short term. It may be
possible in some sectors, such as agriculture, to predict the impact of adjustment policy on specific
socioeconomic groups and their reaction to it in broad terms, but that is all. Any attempt to make a more
detailed forecast of the reaction of certain groups to adjustment measures will to some extent be a question
of guesswork, and it is likely that the response at micro-level will differ according to country and culture.
Most economic models are not sophisticated enough to be of any help. There is a very real danger,
therefore, that certain economic measures will prove too heavy-handed or backfire, despite the good
intentions behind them. The authorities in the country in question often have no factual information to hand
about the local situation with which it would be possible to make a more accurate analysis. The resources
and manpower/expertise necessary for collecting such data are often lacking. This makes it extremely
difficult to pursue an effective poverty-reduction policy geared to the specific needs of particular groups.
<p>
The policy document "A World of Difference" refers in this context to the need for "a far-reaching
knowledge of and insight into social processes" and asks what categories of poor people should be
distinguished.
<p>
<h4>Inadequate coordination due to the interests of the donor countries</h4>

It should come as no surprise that development policy is influenced in part by the interests of the donor
countries themselves. However, this is another factor which hinders coordination between the donor
countries as a group and with the recipient countries and the multilateral financial institutions.
<p>
<h4>Excessive influence of donors over long-term policy</h4>

Because the developing countries often lack any systematic data or knowledge and understanding of their
socioeconomic situation, they have very limited scope for presenting a wellfounded long-term policy of their
own. This is a major handicap for them when it comes to formulating a view of their own future in the
discussions held with donors about the adjustment measures to be taken. This task is more or less
automatically taken over by the donors, who proceed to formulate a long-term policy for their own activities
in the developing countries, often on the basis of inaccurate information and instruments which are not
sufficiently geared to the local situation.
<p>
<h3>Conclusions and recommendations</h3>

The report comes to the conclusion that developing countries are not given sufficient opportunity to voice
their own opinions on long-term development policy. Development policy is primarily the responsibility of
the governments of developing countries. Donors may of course ask questions about that policy. The report
sees the relative inability of developing countries to formulate a well-founded viewpoint as a fundamental
problem. It means that they are often more or less forced to accept the strategies proposed by others, which
are often tied to funding and reflect interests other than their own. A policy which has been accepted only
under external pressure is less likely to be successful because it does not have the wholehearted support of
the recipient country.
<p>
This problem is partly brought about by a lack of technical capacity on the part of the competent authorities
in developing countries. The Council recommends that countries be given more support in shaping and
planning their own development on the basis of priorities they themselves have formulated. This can be done
by strengthening the government agencies responsible for research and planning in these countries,
preferably in the framework of an innovative policy of technical aid and long-term aid relations. Such
support would be conditional on the countries conducting a policy geared to eliminating poverty.
<p>
The report concludes that besides problems of a technical nature there is also a lack of scientific understan-
ding of the socioeconomic structures in society. A different view is adopted of the working of the national
economy than is customary in macroeconomics. If a more careful analysis is made macroeconomic issues,
aims and stategies can be integrated with more specific objectives with regard to poverty, the environment,
the rural or urban population, the access of particular groups to education or other social services, or the use
of natural resources. Integral analysis is essential, both from the point of view of macroeconomic policy and
with regard to supporting policy recommendations at micro-level. Such integration has been lacking to date
in the analysis not only of structural adjustment but also of specific target group, sectoral and regional
problems. More needs to be known about gender relationships, the division of labour and decision-making
within households if integral analysis is to be possible. An integrated approach is necessary both in the
developing countries and on the part of the bilateral and multilateral donors. Models have been, or are
being, developed which will permit a more effective analysis to be made. A number of examples are
mentioned in the report.
<p>
The Council recommends that more use be made of integral analysis models. The World Bank should be
encouraged to resume its old pioneering role in the field of policy analysis.
<p>
The Council concludes that a greater understanding of local circumstances in countries with which the
Netherlands has an aid relationship is essential. The same point is made in the policy document "A World of
Difference". The Council recommends that understanding of local circumstances be improved by commis-
sioning more research in these countries.
<p>
Information which would allow a prompt response to be made to unforeseen situations is not always
immediately available. The Council recommends in such cases that an early warning system be set up to
detect in advance major disruptions in the normal pattern of events (e.g. crop failure). It may be necessary,
with regard to the accumulation of information on individual countries, for donors to specialise in one field
or another; the EC could play a role here.
<p>
The problem of coordinating policy at macro and micro-level applies equally to the formulation and
implementation of environmental policy. A thorough understanding of the role played by the environment at
micro-level as the means of livelihood for specific groups is crucial to an effective policy. Poverty
alleviation and sustainability must be given a key position. Environmental policy should also guarantee that a
consensus is reached on the way in which various uses of the environment by different groups can be
reconciled with each other. The Council fears that the so-called "hard option", which prohibits the
destruction of non-renewable natural resources, places too severe a restriction on the ability of poor
countries to pursue a policy aimed at combating poverty. The Council concludes that this would particularly
affect those of the poor with limited access to non-renewable resources.
<p>
The Council recommends that the replacement of natural resources by other productive capital should not
be excluded unless it can be shown that the preservation of certain natural resources does not stand in the
way of poverty alleviation. Macroeconomic policy, including adjustment programmes, should be assessed in
the light of its effects on each socioeconomic group and their access to natural resources.
<p>
<h3>Other recommendations</h3>

The Council recommends that countries which make genuine efforts to implement an effective structural
adjustment programme should be offered the prospect of more permanent benefits, such as inclusion in a
currency zone similar to that of the Francophone countries of Africa.
<p>
Investments should be compatible with the implementing capacity of the government. The Council
recommends a more hands-off approach with regard to investments. Donor countries must ensure that new
projects do not conflict with the necessary rationalisation of activities. As market forces come increasingly
into play, investment decisions can be further decentralised. The identification and support of development
projects can then take place from the bottom up.

d&#233;veloppement (NAR) peuvent &ecirc;tre command&#233;s aupr&#232;s du

<b>Le 1er juillet 1993, le Conseil Consultatif National pour la Coop&#233;ration au
D&#233;veloppement (NAR) a pr&#233;sent&#233; &#224; M. Jan Pronk, ministre de la
Coop&#233;ration au D&#233;veloppement, une d&#233;claration sur la teneur et la
norme de la coop&#233;ration n&#233;erlandaise au d&#233;veloppement.</b>
<p>
<h3>R&#233;sum&#233;</h3>

Par cette d&#233;claration, le Conseil entend apporter une contribution au d&#233;bat
engag&#233; au sein de la soci&#233;t&#233; et du monde politique aux Pays-Bas sur la
coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. Il pose &#224; cet effet:
<ul>
<li>qu'il convient de mettre fin le plus rapidement possible &#224; la confusion qui
r&#232;gne actuellement quant au contenu et &#224; la norme - dans cet ordre - de l'aide
n&#233;erlandaise;
<li>que la norme appliqu&#233;e jusque r&#233;cemment n'est absolument pas
excessive, eu &#233;gard aux probl&#232;mes, nouveaux ou connus, auxquels les pays en
d&#233;veloppement sont confront&#233;s;
<li>que les probl&#232;mes actuels des pays en d&#233;veloppement doivent &ecirc;tre
consid&#233;r&#233;s ou reconsid&#233;r&#233;s &#224; la lumi&#232;re des
d&#233;veloppements r&#233;cents;
<li>qu'une clarification de la politique n&#233;erlandaise s'impose, certainement si l'on
prend en compte le soutien que le Conseil a constat&#233; au sein de la population pour la
coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. 
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Clarifier la politique</h3>

Le Conseil pr&#233;conise qu'un certain nombre de mesures soient prises, dans un
d&#233;lai pr&#233;alablement fix&#233; de cinq ans, pour faire face aux
probl&#232;mes, nouveaux ou connus, qui se posent: aide accrue pour les pays en
d&#233;veloppement les plus pauvres, aide r&#233;duite pour les pays en
d&#233;veloppement plus riches, mesures en faveur de l'Europe centrale et orientale et
mesures en faveur de l'environnement. Une fois la nouvelle composition de l'aide
d&#233;finie, il convient de fixer, &#224; la fin de la p&#233;riode de cinq ans, le volume
de l'aide n&#233;erlandaise au niveau actuel, soit 1, 5  per cent du revenu national net (RNN).
<p>
Le Conseil plaide en faveur d'une conclusion rapide des n&#233;gociations commerciales
multilat&#233;rales dans le cadre de l'Uruguay Round, devant d&#233;boucher sur des
possibilit&#233;s accrues d'exportation pour les pays en d&#233;veloppement. Il entrevoit
par ailleurs la possibilit&#233; de parvenir &#224; des accords commerciaux au niveau
r&#233;gional entre le Nord et le Sud.
<p>
La protection des march&#233;s des pays riches contre les importations de biens en
provenance des pays en d&#233;veloppement et contre l'immigration de ressortissants de
ces pays en qu&ecirc;te de travail limite les possibilit&#233;s de d&#233;veloppement des
pays du Sud. Raison de plus pour apporter une aide &#224; ces pays de mani&#232;re
&#224; compenser les limitations qui leur sont ainsi impos&#233;es.
<p>
Le d&#233;bat sur les nouvelles t&#226;ches dans le domaine de l'environnement, de la
paix et de la s&#233;curit&#233; et sur l'aide 0ux pays d'Europe centrale et orientale ne
doit pas &ecirc;tre &#233;vit&#233;. Ces domaines pr&#233;sentent des points de
convergence avec la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement et peuvent donc &ecirc;tre
int&#233;gr&#233;s, sous certains conditions, &#224; la politique du d&#233;veloppement.

<p>
Par souci d'efficacit&#233; et afin de pr&#233;venir la dispersion de l'aide, le Conseil
entend limiter le nombre de pays - actuellement 54 - avec lesquels les Pays-Bas
entretiennent des relations de coop&#233;ration. Pour ce qui est de la r&#233;alisation des
objectifs de lutte structurelle contre la pauvret&#233;, l'accent doit &ecirc;tre mis sur les
37 pays les plus pauvres auxquels les Pays-Bas accordent actuellement une aide. L'extension
du programme d'aide aux pays d'Europe centrale et orientale n&#233;cessite
&#233;galement une r&#233;duction du nombre de pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiant de l'aide
des Pays-Bas.
<p>
<h3>Stopper le d&#233;tournement de l'aide &#224; des fins impropres</h3>

Le Conseil est optimiste quant au soutien de la population n&#233;erlandaise pour l'aide au
d&#233;veloppement. Il s'oppose au d&#233;tournement de l'aide &#224; des fins
impropres dans la politique n&#233;erlandaise, ainsi qu'&#224; la prise de d&#233;cisions
politiques non seulement confuses, mais encore contraires aux intentions et aux voeux d'une
grande partie de la population n&#233;erlandaise.
L'utilisation, en particulier depuis 1989, des cr&#233;dits de la coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement &#224; des fins impropres doit &ecirc;tre stopp&#233;e dans un
d&#233;lai pr&#233;alablement fix&#233; afin d'ouvrir la voie &#224; une politique
nouvelle.
<p>
<h3>Mesures &#224; prendre</h3>

Partant de la situation actuelle, le Conseil recommande au gouvernement de prendre dans
les cinq ann&#233;es &#224; venir les mesures suivantes :
<ul>
<li>Aide publique au d&#233;veloppement (APD): La premi&#232;re priorit&#233; doit
&ecirc;tre de porter cette aide,dont profitent les pays en d&#233;veloppement par le biais
de programmes multilat&#233;raux et bilat&#233;raux (y compris par l'interm&#233;diaire
des organisations de cofinancement) &#224; 1% du PNB (elle est actuellement de 0,78 %)
dans le budget pour 1998. Le tableau ci-dessous indique les objectifs &#224; fixer:

<p>
<li>Suppression des d&#233;penses impropres: Il convient de pr&#233;ciser clairement
les d&#233;penses qui doivent rester imput&#233;es au budget de la coop&#233;ration et
celles qui pourraient le devenir. Un certain nombre de d&#233;penses actuellement
imput&#233;es au budget du d&#233;veloppement doivent en &ecirc;tre exclues, en
particulier les frais d'accueil des demandeurs d'asile, la contribution vers&#233;e au
minist&#232;re de l'Enseignement et divers autres postes qui ne servent  en rien les
int&#233;r&ecirc;ts des pays en d&#233;veloppement. Les deux premiers postes (accueil
des demandeurs d'asile, contribution au minist&#232;re de l'Enseignement)
s'&#233;l&#232;vent dans le budget de 1993 &#224; 36 % de la totalit&#233; du budget
non-APD, soit 497,7 millions de florins sur un total de 1.385 millions. La totalit&#233; du
budget non-ADP repr&#233;sente 0,24 % du PNB ou 0,31 % du RNN. Cette mesure doit
intervenir dans un d&#233;lai fix&#233; &#224; l'avance (de 5 ans).

<li>S&#233;lection des pays: Il est imp&#233;ratif, pour des raisons d'efficacit&#233;,
de d&#233;finir de fa&#231;on plus rigoureuse le nombre de pays entrant en ligne de
compte pour une aide au d&#233;veloppement. Au moins 80 % des cr&#233;dits APD
pour l'aide bilat&#233;rale doivent &ecirc;tre mis &#224; la disposition de pays dont le
revenu par habitant &#233;tait inf&#233;rieur, en 1991, &#224; 650 $, les pays dont le
revenu par habitant (en 1991) &#233;tait sup&#233;rieur &#224; 1235 $ ne devant
b&#233;n&#233;ficier d'aucune aide au titre de l'APD. Les pays dont le revenu par
habitant se situe entre ces deux montants peuvent b&#233;n&#233;ficier, dans des
circonstances particuli&#232;res, de pr&ecirc;ts &#224; des conditions de faveur
r&#233;pondant aux crit&#232;res APD.

<li>Nouveaux pays: L'aide aux pays d'Europe centrale et orientale pourra
automatiquement &ecirc;tre imput&#233;e au budget APD lorsque ces pays
r&#233;pondront aux crit&#232;res de la liste CAD et pourvu que ce soit &#224; des
conditions de faveur suffisantes. Cette aide doit &ecirc;tre imput&#233;e au budget de
l'aide au d&#233;veloppement dans la mesure o&ugrave; les d&#233;penses impropres
seront supprim&#233;es; dans le cas contraire, il faudra voter des cr&#233;dits
suppl&#233;mentaires.

<li>D&#233;penses au titre de l'environnement: Les aides accord&#233;es par les Pays-
Bas aux pays de la liste du CAD par le biais de canaux bilat&#233;raux et
multilat&#233;raux (du Fonds pour l'Environnement Mondial, par exemple) et susceptibles
de leur permettre de satisfaire aux obligations des conventions internationales en
mati&#232;re d'environnement, seront automatiquement class&#233;es APD par le CAD.
Ces aides devront &ecirc;tre imput&#233;es au budget de l'aide au d&#233;veloppement
dans la mesure o&ugrave; les d&#233;penses impropres seront supprim&#233;es; dans le
cas contraire, il faudra voter des cr&#233;dits suppl&#233;mentaires.

<li>S&#233;paration des d&#233;penses: Un certain nombre de d&#233;penses
imput&#233;es au budget de la coop&#233;ration qui, bien qu'ayant un rapport avec les
pays en d&#233;veloppement ne sont pas class&#233;es dans la cat&#233;gorie APD par le
CAD, doivent &ecirc;tre plafonn&#233;es (d&#233;penses non-APD pour les frais
administratifs, certaines bonifications d'int&#233;r&ecirc;t, etc.). Ces d&#233;penses
doivent &ecirc;tre ramen&#233;es &#224; 0,14 % du PNB dans un d&#233;lai de cinq
ans.

<li>S&#233;curit&#233;: Les fonds destin&#233;s &#224; l'aide au
d&#233;veloppement ne doivent pas &ecirc;tre utilis&#233;s pour mettre un terme &#224;
des conflits; ils peuvent toutefois &ecirc;tre consacr&#233;s tant &#224; l'aide humanitaire
en cas de conflit qu'&#224; la reconstruction apr&#232;s un conflit. Pour &#233;valuer le
niveau des d&#233;penses militaires des pays en d&#233;veloppement et arr&ecirc;ter la
politique d'aide, il y a lieu de se conformer, dans la mesure du possible, aux crit&#232;res
communs propos&#233;s par l'ensemble des pays donateurs. L'aide au processus de mise
en place d'institutions d&#233;mocratiques, y compris au niveau local, en particulier
d'institutions visant &#224; promouvoir des proc&#233;dures fiables, doit &ecirc;tre
prioritaire.
</ul>
<p>
"Ce serait un miracle si nous r&#233;ussissions, avec notre fa&#231;on de fonctionner!"
d&#233;clarait Nehru en pr&#233;sentant le premier Plan quinquennal de l'Inde. Le
Conseil est convaincu que les probl&#232;mes internationaux en mati&#232;re de
s&#233;curit&#233;, de pauvret&#233; et d'environnement augmenteront en gravit&#233;
et en ampleur dans la d&#233;cennie &#224; venir et qu'ils exigeront des efforts et des
sacrifices plus grands de la part des pays industrialis&#233;s. En tant que partenaire dans la
coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement et d&#233;fenseur au niveau international des
int&#233;r&ecirc;ts des pays en d&#233;veloppement et de leurs populations, les Pays-Bas
doivent confirmer qu'ils fourniront une contribution appropri&#233;e et fiable &#224; la
solution de ces probl&#232;mes. Ils doivent m&ecirc;me, le cas &#233;ch&#233;ant,
s'efforcer de relever la norme de l'aide, un objectif de 2 % du revenu national net
n'&#233;tant pas excessif.

<title>Dutch aid has never been so donor-centric</title>

Dutch aid has never been so donor-centric</h2>
<h4>by <i>Marit Scheepmakera</i>
<p>
Full text of an article from <i>Vice Versa (a quarterly magazine on
development work published by SNV)</i><br>Vol 29, No. 5, 1995: page
8</h4>
</center>
<hr>
<b>The "use" of development cooperation is discussed ever more
openly in the Netherlands. Aid doesn't help, or so claim the
sceptics, and they point primarily to Africa. No other continent
receives so much aid per head of population, and, at the same time,
in no other continent is the poverty so vast. But the Dutch
Government now wishes to take a different approach to development
cooperation - hopefully one which will prove to be more efficient.
A new exchange in which the recipient countries are to assume
greater responsibility.</b>
<p>
In recent years Dutch aid to African countries has fluctuated
between 1200 and 1300 million guilders. In 1996 a sum of 685
million guilders has been set aside for the regular cooperation
programmes with Egypt, Ethiopia, Yemen, Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso,
Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Senegal, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda,
Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Thatþs 35 million guilders more
than in 1995 and 23 million more than was spent in 1994. With
adjustment to account for inflation, the total expenditure on
Africa is roughly the same as in 1990. In that year, at the first
meeting of the GCA in Maastricht, Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers
promised that Dutch aid to Africa would increase by 50% by the year
2000. Thus up to now little of what was promised has materialized.
Yet there would certainly appear to be every reason to increase the
aid. The current expectations are that by the year 2010 there will
be another 300 million chronically underfed people in Sub-Saharan
Africa. Yet in the explanatory statement accompanying the budget
for 1996 it appears that the Dutch Government is now thinking more
in terms of a different - and hopefully more effective - approach
to aid.
<p>
The same applies to Africa as to the other developing countries
with which the Netherlands cooperates: less aid in the form of
projects and more in terms of budget support, programme aid and
sector aid.
<p>
"It has too often been the case in the past that our policy
objectives differed from those of the African Governments," says
Bernard Berendsen, Head of the Africa Directorate at the
development deopartment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DGIS).
"It appears that many projects fail because they do not mesh with
the policy of a country. As a result, as soon as the donor's back
is turned, the results of the project disappear like snow in the
sun. The inevitable conclusion is that we have to renounce
involvement in a project if the policy conditions are
unfavourable."
<p>
The DGIS is working to integrate development aid within the
national or regional policy of the various African countries. For
example, by contributing "x" million guilders to the education
budget of a country, the DGIS also hopes to be able to exert a
certain amount of influence on the policy as a whole. "The aim is
that the money should find its way to those actively implementing
the programme by means of the shortest route. Thus less money is
sidetracked into all sorts of intermediary organizations and
bodies."
<p>
But what if the organization of the government in question is weak,
corrupt or very centralized? Amongst other things, the latest
explanatory statement to the budget refers to the corruption in
Kenya and Tanzania as being a serious problem. Are such countries
really ideal partners for cooperation?
<p>
Berendsen: "In such cases we will have to keep a strict watch on
expenditure and accountability. There will be a certain amount of
paternalism." He points to the fact that development aid
contributes to a reduction of precisely this kind of corruption and
simultaneously encourages good governance. This can be achieved,
for example, by a reorganization of the mechanism of government
combined with increased salaries for officials. Civil servants are
often forced to take on all sorts of additional employment or to
ask for extra money for services rendered in order to survive.
Another way in which the state mechanism can be strengthened is by
improving the system of taxation in a country.
<p>
Paul Hoebink, who is attached to the Third World Centre of the
Catholic University in Nijmegen is highly sceptical about the new
policy plans. "The Dutch aid to Africa is progressively of symbolic
value. If the Netherlands wishes to exert some kind of influence it
needs to concentrate on a number of countries. This is something we
could do in consultation with the Scandinavian countries and
Germany. If the Netherlands were to "adopt" six or seven African
countries, that would be sufficient. At the moment the development
aid is parcelled out over 56 countries. Minister Pronk is
attempting to use the aid as a crowbar, as a means of exerting
political influence. But the amounts of aid involved are too small
to serve such a purpose. For this reason I don't expect to see the
number of projects being reduced. Small amounts are easily spent on
projects. Hoebink is a member of the National Advisory Council for
Development Cooperation, which came forward earlier this year with
a similar recommendation. He points to the fact that not all
countries encounter problems in managing a large number of projects
- an argument that is often used against support in the form of
projects. "Mali, for example, manages projects very well."
<p>
Pieter Marres, director of training and education at the Royal
Institute for the Tropics, considers that the Netherlands does not
have a genuinely political Africa policy. "It is development
cooperation policy," believes the former head of the West Africa
division of the DGIS. "What you see is the political dimension
gradually being introduced into development cooperation. The issues
concerned being human rights, the position of women, the
environment, democratization and good governance. This has led to
a situation in which Dutch development projects are now assessed on
the basis of a multitude of criteria. The objectives of the Dutch
policy are very worthy objectives, but it is difficult to translate
them into separate projects. Aid has never been so "donor-centric",
by which I do not mean that the aid is primarily intended to
benefit the Dutch business community. The proportion of the aid
going to the business community is only 20 to 30%. It is more so
the case that the aid carries the ideological objectives of the
donor. Instead of this, the Dutch Government would be far better
off considering which of its objectives it wishes to realize in
bilateral consultation with a particular African country
independent of the aid being given. The policy discussion - also in
relation with the developing countries - needs to be carried out at
a high political level. And this is actually the task of the Dutch
Minister of Foreign Affairs. Relations with Mali are not
essentially any different from relations with France." That
Minister Jan Pronk might function in practice as a kind of Minister
of Foreign Affairs for Africa is wrong as far as Marres is
concerned. "I find it wrong on principle. Development cooperation
is one of the instruments of foreign policy. Issues such as
democratization, good governance, peace missions and the
environment do not solely concern the developing countries, and, as
such, these issues are the responsibility of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs."
<p>
Marres welcomes the intention to finance fewer projects with
development money and to extend more programme, sector and general
aid, such as budget support. "I need to see it, before I believe
it. Pronk has a tendency to get very involved in the details when
it comes to the spending of development money. The officials will
also be less enamoured of this new form of aid since it means that
they will be less involved. The implementation will have to be done
far more in the countries themselves. And they will claim that a
great deal will go wrong if they are not involved. And naturally
there is less to be gained by the Netherlands if you say to a
developing country: "You organize it and we will pay."
<p>
He agrees with Pronk that there are good reasons to reduced aid in
the form of projects. "It was an unfortunate choice of aid, since
such a multitude of projects is an enormous burden for the
administrative organization of the African countries." Besides, the
disappointing results of twenty, thirty years of development aid
are sufficient reason in themselves to introduce a different
approach. "If you see how bad education and healthcare are in rural
Africa. That after so many years there is just one book for a whole
class of school children. That in clinics there is absolutely
nothing but three aspirins past their shelf life. Itþs certainly
cause for thought."
<p>
Marres is of the opinion that the DGIS should probably concentrate
all its efforts on macro support. "Why not leave the financing of
projects entirely to the co-financing organizations in the
Netherlands, the business community, trade unions, institutes and
similar organizations? The ministry can restrict itself to a global
policy assessment. In addition to this, the enlisting of local NGOs
is of great importance. The embassies could play an important role
in the selection of the NGOs, sorting out the wheat from the chaff,
investigating which of the local NGOs really meet a need and are
supported. There is so much expertise in the embassies, easily
twenty to twenty-five years experience in the field of development
cooperation. They could do with some work.
<p>
In this set up, the DGIS would have to take on the role of
inspection and evaluation. "And I would appoint some extremely
annoying people to take part in the delegations."

<Title>Kirkstall Valley campaign Letter</Title>

</HEAD>

<BODY BGColor="#FFFFFF" Text="#000000" Link="#0000FF" VLink="#FF00FF" ALink="#FF0000">





<H3>This is the letter included in an email to us from Kirkstall Valley Campaign Group

</H3>



<pre>



In the light of the media interest in allegations of parliamentary

sleaze, I would like to draw your attention to the controversy

surrounding a major development in Kirkstall, Leeds.  Although of

particular concern to local residents, it is of National significance in

that it draws attention to the failure of  existing regulatory bodies to

protect the public interest.  It is a glaring example of how vested

interests and secrecy can destroy a neighbourhood, and how the

Government can suppress the truth.  Certainly, if you are genuinely

interested in sleaze, corruption, maladministration and incompetence,

and more importantly how these can combine to override the public

interest you could do much worse than look at this case.  You will find

that criticism should be levelled at the behaviours of the DoE, the

Treasury solicitors, the officers of the local Council and most

significantly the operation of a former quango, the Leeds Development

Corporation (LDC).



The controversy surrounds the grant of planning permission for a huge

supermarket on playing fields in a highly dense residential area of

Leeds.  The main beneficiaries of this are the local RUFC, several

directors of which were involved on the planning authority (the LDC). 

In addition, the actions of the Chair of the planning authority must be

suspect since most of the decisions leading to this consent were taken

when he had a substantial pecuniary interest (estimated to be 20

million).



A cursory look at the scheme shows that it has been rushed through

without consideration of the highways problems.  The site is situated on

the second busiest road into Leeds and conservative estimates suggest

that the development will lead to a 25% increase in traffic volumes. 

The local population have been denied crossing facilities in the

existing scheme on the grounds that there are too many pedestrians. 

Now, under pressure to push the scheme through, the Highways officers

have failed to consider the interests of Public transport, cyclists and,

most importantly, pedestrians.

This scheme has not yet passed all the obstacles but the Government is

exerting pressure on the Council to push it through.  A little bit of

investigative journalism would certainly give Ministers and the Council

something to think about and, maybe, prevent the accumulated effects of

bias, maladministration and protection of self interest from ruining an

inner city community.



Some key facts, for which there is documentary and legal evidence,

follow:-



  1) Appointment of a major political activist for the Conservative

Party to the Chair of the Leeds Development Corporation (LDC) by the

DoE.  This quango was the planning authority for an area in Kirkstall,

Leeds.



  2) The failure by the aforementioned appointee to declare both a

substantial pecuniary interest (up to 20 million) in connection with a

planning application in Kirkstall, and his connections with the

Developer.



  3) The grant of planning permission by the LDC to this Developer for a

very large supermarket on playing fields in a high density residential

area without consideration of the full traffic and environmental

effects, not to mention the detrimental effect on the local population.



  4) The destruction of evidence (the controversial planning file) by

the LDC at the end of its operational life.  All other planning files

were handed to the Council.



  5) The failure of the DoE to investigate the actions of its

appointees.  Instead it sought to subvert the public interest and defend

the actions of the LDC.



  6) The failure of the Treasury solicitors, acting for the DoE, to

disclose material facts in court.  They knew the planning file had been

destroyed yet stated that it had been handed to Leeds City Council after

the demise of the LDC.



  7) The behaviour of Council officers in the Highways department who

have failed to consider properly the safety and interests of

pedestrians.





Most of the information proving the above statements has already been

collated and all you would need to do is to ask certain Ministers and

local Councillors what threats are being used to push the scheme

through.  This is a case where your questions and reporting of the truth

could prevent a major miscarriage of justice.  I will gladly provide you

with a fuller account of the events surrounding this case and back them

up with  documentary evidence.

I look forward to hearing from you.

<title>World Aids Day - 1st December</title>

</head>

<hr>

<TABLE BORDER=4>

</center><p>



<i>This information has been supplied by<a href="index.html"> AVERT</a></i><hr><p>


<center><h3>WORLD AIDS DAY 1st December</h3></center>

<i>"AIDS is a terrible thing. World AIDS Day is an opportunity to remind people the future is in their hands." <p>

"We don't hear much about AIDS anymore. You need a day once a year to remind people it hasn't gone away." <p>

"At college we had a special lecture about AIDS and HIV because it was World AIDS Day. You realise how many people are affected. People with AIDS and their families, friends, everything...." </i><p>

This page tells you about the meaning of World AIDS Day, the Red Ribbon and how you can help. It gives you the facts and figures about HIV and AIDS in the UK and where to go for further advice and information. <br><br><br>



<center><h3>WORLD AIDS DAY</h3></center>

Every year the 1st December is set aside as a special day for people all over the world to remember all those who have died and all those who have been affected.<p>


It is also a day to continue our efforts to reduce the effect of HIV infection and AIDS in the future. <p>


There are conferences, services of remembrance, public events and meetings all over the UK and many other countries. Many people wear a piece of folded red ribbon as a symbol of AIDS awareness. <p>


Lots of individuals are involved, as well as schools, colleges, health centres, hospitals, charities and voluntary groups. <br><br><br>

<center><h3>'WHAT CAN I DO...?'</h3></center>

Lots more people will become infected with HIV in the future. And lots more families, friends, partners and carers will be affected unless we act NOW.<p>

We need to act:<br>
<li>to educate people so they can avoid infection in the future <br>
<li>to care for and help those needing our support. <p>


If you have children or grand-children you could: <br>
- talk to them about HIV and AIDS.<p>


If you have a sister or brother, a friend or a partner you could:<br>
 - talk to them about what World AIDS Day is. <p>


If you could be at risk in the future, you can make sure you don't become infected yourself. <p>


You can help increase AIDS awareness by wearing a red ribbon on World AIDS Day. <p>


Through talking about AIDS and taking action we can all help to reduce the effects of AIDS in the future.<br><br><br> 


<center><h3>AIDS AND HIV: THE FIGURES</h3></center>

The first person with AIDS in the UK was diagnosed in 1981. By 1995 over 11,000 people in the UK had been diagnosed as having AIDS. Nearly three quarters of these people have already died. <p>


It is much harder to say how many people are infected with HIV. By 1995 over 25,000 people were known to be infected. Of these about<p>



21,500 are men<br>
3,600 are women<br>
600	are children<p>


But these are only the people who are known to be infected. The actual number of infected people could be five times greater. This means that the number of men, women and children infected in the UK could already be over 100,000.<br><br><br> 


<center><h3>THE FACTS</h3></center>

- Every day the number of people infected with HIV in the UK increases. <br>
- There is no cure for AIDS.<br>
- We all need to act NOW to reduce the effect that HIV infection and AIDS will have in the future. <br><br><br>


<center><h3>INFORMATION ABOUT AIDS</h3></center>

AIDS is caused by a virus called HIV.<p>


After a person has been infected with HIV for some time, their body's natural defence system can no longer fight against diseases which they would normally get over quite easily. <p>


When the person gets one or more of these serious diseases they are considered to have AIDS. Most people with AIDS die within three years of diagnosis.<p>


Many people live with HIV infection for many years without any signs of ill health. It can be as much as ten years or more after becoming infected before someone develops AIDS. <p>


Even if a person does not have any symptoms of ill health they can still pass on HIV to someone else. <p>


The main ways in which people become infected with HIV are: <br>
- by having sexual intercourse with an infected person<br>
- by injecting drugs with a needle or syringe which has been used by someone who is infected <br>
- by the virus being passed by an infected woman to her unborn child or through breastfeeding. <p>


This is because the virus is present in the sexual fluids and blood of infected people. If infected blood or fluids get into your blood then you can become infected.<br><br><br>


<center><h3>THE RED RIBBON</h3></center>

Anyone can make or wear a red ribbon. It is one way that you can show your concern about AIDS. <p>


To make your own red ribbon:<br>
<li>Get an ordinary piece of red ribbon about six inches long <br>
<li>Fold it into a loop, then fasten it using an ordinary safety pin. <p>


Making extra red ribbons and giving them to your friends and relatives to wear is one way of helping to raise AIDS awareness. <br><br><br>

Finland's and EU's Development Cooperation: A Comparison.<br>
<i>Jarle Harstad and Paul Silfverberg</i><p></h3>
<h5>(Summary of FINNIDA Evaluation Study 1995:2)<br></h5>
</center><p>
<hr>
Upon Finland's entry into the European Union, FINNIDA decided to carry out a comparative analysis of Finland's and the EU's development cooperation policies and modalities. The points of departure were the new obligations and responsibilities as well as the new opportunities which participation in the new European-level international cooperation offered Finland. The study contains:
<ul>
<li>a comparative analysis of Finnish and EU development cooperation policies and processes;<br>
<li>a comparison of the modalities of developing country relations, as well as the concurrence and coherence between and within Finnish and EU relations;<br>
<li>visions for future Finnish participation in policy dialogue and development cooperation issues within the EU.
</ul><p>
After a review of EU and Finnish development policy and programmes, the authors suggest that:
<ul>
<li>Finnish comparative advantages compared to the EU seem to be in the areas of environmental protection, sustainable use of natural resources, and social development (including gender issues).<p>
<li>Finland can benefit from cooperation within the EU in matters such as democratisation, macro-economic policies, institutional development, trade, untying of aid, and the development of private sector institutions.<p>
<li>Finland can activity promote Finnish experience and expertise in countries such as Vietnam, Nepal, and Nicaragua where the EU has been a marginal donor until now.<p>
<li>Finland should continue its efforts to increase recipient responsibility and execution in its programmes. This includes seeking to influence the EU towards establishing real partnerships with recipient countries.<p>
<li>Together with fellow EU members, Finland should assess ways to simplify and streamline EU aid and cooperation procedures, espcially for ACP countries.<p>
<li>Both Finnish and EU aid should gradually shift from an emphasis on attainment of physical targets toward more concern for local competence and institution building.

NGOs and the IGC</h2>

<p>
<h4>Full text of an article from <i>Lom&#233; 2000</i>, No. 2, May 1996: page 3</h4>
</center>
<hr>
<P>
While the Inter Governmental Conference to revise the Maastricht
Treaty does not have development cooperation on its agenda, the
NGO community in Europe is determined to influence IGC discussions
so that their values and principles are reflected in the common
foreign and security policy of the EU.
<P>
From 19-20 April, participants at the annual NGDO-LC Conference
on &quot;The IGC and a Europe open to the world&quot; discussed
the coherence of European policies affecting developing countries.
Three main questions were addressed: What are the inconsistencies
in EU policies, where do they come from, and how can they be overcome?
Three policy-areas were singled out: the common foreign and security
policy; immigration and citizenship policies; and common economic
policies (mainly trade and agriculture) that seem to &quot;give
with one hand and take with the other.&quot; Participants concluded
that inconsistencies are mainly due to the clash of interests
between different groups in Europe, including within civil society
(consumers, agro-business).
<P>
The view that the EU should respect the objectives it sets for
itself and promote values of human security was equally at the
core of two NGO meetings held in London and Helsinki to discuss
the future of EU aid.
<P>
The British platform of the NGO-EC Liaison Committee organised
a conference entitled &quot;Lost Horizons? The future of Europe's
Relations with the South.&quot; Representatives of the Commission,
the British Government and the European Parliament gave their
views on the future direction of EU aid. Opinions were split on
several issues of concern to the NGO's -- the focus on the poorest
countries, the reorientation of EU interests and aid towards neighbouring
countries. The IGC, the future of Lom&eacute; and the position
of LDCs in the world trade system were also discussed.
<P>
These issues also dominated a meeting organised by KEPA, the Finnish
NGO umbrella organisation. ECDPM presented some of the challenges
facing EU development cooperation at this seminar whose aim was
to raise awareness of EU development cooperation among Finnish
NGOs. Despite their newness to the Lom&eacute; scene, the critical
comments by Finnish NGOs will be valuable inputs into the ongoing
reflection review process.

<b>In march 1994 the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) presented its report
nr. 103, `Development cooperation and fighting urban poverty' to the Minister for Development
Cooperation, J.P. Pronk. This summary contains a description of the problem as the Council has identified
it, the results of an analysis of the problem and of policy, the Council's conclusions and its recommen-
dations for the policy of the Minister for Development Cooperation. </b>
<p>

<h3>The growth of towns and urban poverty in the Third World</h3>

According to projections by the United Nations, 51% of the world's population will live in towns and cities
in the year 2000 and as many as 65% in the year 2025. The total population of the world will be 8.4 billion
in the year 2000, 4.4 billion of whom will live in the towns of developing countries. Primary and medium-
sized towns in developing countries will grow explosively, especially in Asia and Africa. Because of their
unbalanced demographic structure - large numbers of young migrants and a high excess of births over deaths
- the population in towns and cities will continue to grow faster than in rural areas for a long time, even if
migration to towns declines. 
<p>
A growing percentage of the urban population of Latin America, and of Africa and Asia, live below the
poverty line. Between 1970 and 1980, the population of greater Sao Paulo rose by 44%, but that of the
working-class districts went up by 446% in the same period. More than a third of urban residents in Asia
(1985) live below the poverty line and the figure is as high as 86% in Bangladesh. Even in the rapidly
expanding economies of South and East Asia more than 10% of the urban population live below the poverty
line. 
<p>
Absolute poverty in the world, measured in terms of income, is still worst in rural areas. According to
statistics the level of provisions and facilities is higher in urban than in rural areas. However, a growing
number of the urban poor are affected by a concentration of inter-related poverty factors. According to their
own perception of their circumstances the urban poor see "vulnerability" as the main feature of their
existence. They often have no access to provisions such as education, health care, proper housing and credit
and other facilities for work and income. In most Third World towns and cities a large percentage of the
workforce is unemployed or working in temporary jobs. The growth of the workforce - the population
between 15 and 65 years of age - is usually faster in towns than that of the urban population as a whole.
The demand for labour by the government authorities and large and medium-sized business declined sharply
in the eighties in a number of developing countries. The fall in real wages in the public sector and major
private sector companies and the large numbers of unemployed have also caused incomes to drop in the
informal sector. The levels of protection for employees have fallen dramatically.
<p>
The urban poor do not have social networks, nor do they have any influence on political decision-making
processes or say about the circumstances in which they live. The urban authorities do not usually have the
management capacity or the resources to deal with the complex problems effectively. Nevertheless, many of
the urban poor actually succeed in raising their standard of living. In a number of towns, the residents of
slum areas have successfully formed self-help organisations, often for highly specific purposes such as
housing and water. The appalling living conditions of poor people in towns also create psychological and
social problems in the form of stress, alienation, instability and insecurity, heightened by the disappointment
of expectations which have failed to materialise and the discrepancy between incomes and spending
opportunities in towns. This situation often leads to social unrest, forms of violence and crime in which
young people are both victims and offenders, child abuse and violence against women in the home.
<p>
<h3>The most affected groups</h3>

The vicious circle of marginalisation in towns is worst for three groups of poor people:
<ul>
<li>Mothers, especially breadwinners who are heads of poor households i.e. women-maintained
households. The repercussions of a poor diet, bad health, living conditions in slums, and long hours at work
and travelling to and from the workplace are worst for pregnant women with jobs.
<li>Street children. Children and young people up to the age of 24 represent 55.8% of the total population
of developing countries and 65% in Africa (1992). The low family incomes of the poor, their limited access
to work and the disintegration of the family mean more children end up on the streets. Estimates suggest the
world total amounts to tens of millions. The most vulnerable are once again girls aged between 12 and 16
and pre-teenagers. Street children are left to fend for themselves and many end up in crime and prostitution.
They are abused by the drugs mafia and in Latin America they are exposed to violence by the police and
death squads.
<li>Unemployed young people. Unemployment is especially high among young people up to the age of
25. They have little access to the informal sector and small companies. The young also have to compete
with older people who have lost their jobs in the formal sector.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Existing policy to fight urban poverty</h3>

The Council's report examines the policies of a large number of players who are attempting to fight urban
poverty. The Council notes that the policy priorities of developing countries, multilateral donors and the
Netherlands Minister for Development Cooperation do not always coincide. The authorities of developing
countries only approach the problem of the urban poor as a separate issue as an exception. Even an
organisation like the World Bank places its efforts to reduce urban poverty in the context of general urban
development. The priorities of Netherlands policy such as work and incomes, the human settlements sector
and improving public administration are no different from those of the  multilateral organisations, although
the strong emphasis of current policy on direct measures to fight urban poverty is an exception.
<p> 
To summarise, the Council has the following comments about Netherlands development policy:
<ul>
<li>Development policy to fight urban poverty is formulated as a flanking policy, not only in relation to
the policy of virtually all the relevant multilateral organisations, but also in relation to the policy of most
developing countries.
<li>Policy as a whole does not focus explicitly on problems of unemployment among young people and
their lack of training, the position of women in towns and the problem of urban environment, nor on special
opportunities for Netherlands policy to solve problems in secondary towns. Publications do not suggest that
the Women and Environment Spearhead Programmes have integrated urban aspects into their activities. In
the view of the Council this means that an important area of policy - unemployment among young people -
is not receiving attention.
<li>The Council endorses the importance of programmes by the Netherlands Finance Company for
Developing Countries (FMO) and the Retired Managers Assignment Programme (PUM) to generate
employment in developing countries.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Basic premises</h3>

The Council's most important conclusion is that a special policy needs to be formulated in view of the
nature and rapidly growing urgency of urban poverty. The Council's basic premise is that policy to reduce
urban poverty is an integral part of Netherlands development policy as a whole. 
<p>
The Council considers that Netherlands bilateral aid to fight urban poverty should be confined to cities
which have no more than one to two million inhabitants, if only because the Netherlands can not call on the
expertise required to administer very large cities. In view of the structural nature of the problem, the choice
of towns will involve long-term cooperation with "concentration towns". The Council also thinks that the
three most important target groups for Netherlands policy which is designed to fight urban poverty should
be women-maintained households, unemployed young people and street children.
<p>
Formulation of Netherlands policy in this area should be based on a broad and integrated vision and a
process approach. In view of the inter-related nature of the problems, attempts to solve urban poverty will
require simultaneous policy interventions at various administrative levels and of different kinds: human
resource development to raise productivity, improvements in administration and management, macro-
economic policy, creating facilities, promoting the participation of the urban poor and helping them to form
their own organisations, investing in economic activities and infrastructure, combined with improving the
urban environment.  
<p>
The Council attaches great importance to stimulating economic growth as a necessary, though not in itself
sufficient precondition to fight poverty in general and urban poverty in particular. It believes productivity
must be raised in many developing countries, despite the apparent contradiction between this objective and
the possibility of unemployment as a result of short-term and long-term increases in productivity. 
<p>
The Council considers that Netherlands policy to fight urban poverty must make allowance for the extent to
which national development policies of governments of recipient countries allow for the effects of such
policies on the urban poor. Using this criterion, Netherlands policy can make choices to flank or support the
policy of governments or multilateral organisations, and to support certain types of activities such as those
of local NGOs. The Council considers that in countries where national governments do not pursue a
redistribution policy, NGOs should be supported which are trying to help the poor, with the aim of
persuading governments to revise their policies.
<p>

<h3>Policy recommendations</h3>

The Council recommends intensifying the Spearhead Programme for Fighting Urban Poverty in order to
achieve the integrated approach which it advises in its recommendations. 
<p>
If possible the Council recommends that towns should be chosen using an urban poverty index.
<p>
The Council makes a distinction between direct and indirect forms of fight ing urban poverty. Direct
measures to fight poverty means activities which are undertaken in cooperation with or on the initiative of
target groups. Indirect measures to fight poverty include activities designed to improve situations which
partly determine the lives of the target groups, over which they have no say or influence.
<p>

<h4>Direct measures to fight poverty</h4>

The Council recommends promoting direct measures to fight poverty in towns by continuing to provide
NGOs with direct or indirect assistance to encourage the poor to form their own organisations and to take
care of street children. It makes good sense to carry out policy to help unemployed young people in
cooperation with the Netherlands joint financing organisations (MFOs), both sides of Netherlands industry -
unions and employers' organisations - and SNV, all of whom are already involved in such activities. The
Council recommends examining where these organisations can see opportunities to contribute towards the
training of young people and the level to which the local private sector can be involved in such activities.
<p>
The Council recommends that the Netherlands should contribute to the creation of temporary safety net
constructions of the kind used in Bolivia and Jamaica. Steps must be taken to ensure that a Social Develop-
ment Fund meets the conditions which are necessary to ensure that the available funds benefit the target
groups in particular. Although people who depend on wages in a number of countries are among the
vulnerable groups when they become unemployed, in the Council's view they do not occupy an exceptional
position in this respect.
<p>
The Council recommends that the policy dialogue with developing countries on the problems of the urban
poor should take the following considerations into account in relation to the living conditions in working-
class and slum areas:
<ul>
<li>increasing the feasibility and sustainability of activities by involving the population in planning and
implementation;
<li>providing housing rights and land rights and improving the urban infrastructure by making safe
drinking water and sanitation available and refuse collection facilities;
<li>creating opportunities for self-help activities connected with agriculture - such as crops and small
livestock - or making such activities legal in working-class districts;
<li>providing advisory services which will help to persuade small and medium-sized companies in
working-class districts to implement process improvements which will result in less industrial waste and
improve working conditions, especially those of the target groups in such companies; and
<li>improving the quality of the services provided by the urban authorities. 
</ul>
<p>
<h4>Indirect measures to fight poverty</h4>

The Council recommends supporting the policy of the World Bank and the IMF to improve the economic
structure and macro-economic policy in recipient countries. Allowance should be made for the consequences
of this policy for the urban poor. On the basis of an analysis of the effects, flanking activities can be
undertaken, through bilateral channels  if necessary, especially in concentration towns.
<p>
The Council considers that cooperation between UNCHS, UNDP and the World Bank in the Urban
Management Programme merits further support and recommends examining how far it is possible to make
allowance  at the implementation stage for the choice of towns by the Netherlands and the deployment of
Netherlands expertise in this field. In connection with the shortage of resources of the urban authorities the
Council recommends investigating how far the Netherlands can become involved in the World Bank's
Urban Development Loans, especially the parts which relate to improving the urban infrastructure.
<p>
The Council recommends examining the conditions under which Netherlands companies would be willing to
invest in economic activities in concentration towns selected by the Netherlands. In the Council's view, the
demand for products of small businesses is largely determined by the incomes of people who work for large
and medium-sized companies and for government authorities.
<p>
The Council recommends investigating whether opportunities can be created through bilateral or multilateral
channels to stimulate credits for housing by means of local currency loans. It is still important to continue
existing policy in order to support initiatives in the field of credit unions, often through NGOs.
<p>

<h3>Research</h3>

The Minister also asked the Council to examine the need for research to increase the effectiveness of policy
to fight urban poverty. The Council has identified thirteen areas in which  research can fill existing
information gaps. The Council believes that it is important to involve the perspective of the poor themselves
in each field of research. The five most important areas are as follows:
<ul>
<li>The perception of urban problems among the poor and the survival strategies they have developed as
the basis for policy. 
<li>Regular research in countries which are selected, especially in concentration cities, into the effect of
macro-economic policy on urban poverty. 
<li>The conditions which will allow poor people's organisations to have an effective influence on local
urban policy, for the benefit of the policy of NGOs and local and national authorities.
<li>The role of NGOs and companies in training young people.
<li>The integration and disintegration of groups of migrants in towns and the survival strategy at
household level, especially in women-maintained households.

From words to deeds: Gender and development,<br>
the fourth UN World Women's Conference in Beijing, 1995</h2>

<hr>
<b>
This was the title of recommendation no. 106, submitted on 22 August 1995 by the
Netherlands'  National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) to the Minister for
Development Cooperation, Jan Pronk.</b>
<p>
The NAR notes with concern the increase in violence, especially sexual violence, directed against
women throughout the world. The Council believes that violence against women and girls would
not be so widespread if it were not based on equally widespread acceptance, on the part of both
society and governments.
<p>
The Council supports the Netherlands Government's present policy, which unequivocally rejects
female circumcision. However, the Netherlands should make efforts to promote the
implementation of international agreements and conventions, if necessary through the use of
coercive measures, to stop or curb increasing violence against women. This view is set out in
the NAR report `From words to deeds', which was commissioned by the Minister for
Development Cooperation in the run-up to the fourth UN World Women's Conference to be held
between 4 and 14 September 1995 in Beijing.
<p>
The Council focuses its recommendations on gender and development on three themes: women
and poverty, women and human rights, and women and decision-making. These provide a
framework within which a look is taken at all the `Critical Areas of Concern' set out in the draft
programme of action of the fourth UN World Women's Conference. The Council consistently
bases its recommendations on the need for a transformation of existing gender relations. This
means that gender-related issues have consistently to be integrated into general policy. Men
should be emphatically reminded of their responsibilities in the process, so that women can
realise their sexual and social rights. It is crucial that the World Women's Conference results in a
genuine plan of action for women: `Not words, but deeds'.
<p>
The Council sees the promotion and implementation of human rights, notably economic, social
and cultural rights, as a strategic method of linking the results of a number of UN conferences.
The Council urges greater recognition of the universality of human rights, inter alia through the
adoption of a code of conduct governing the extent of the restrictions which governments are
permitted to impose on them. Furthermore, the Council argues that the supervisory mechanisms
to enforce compliance with ESC rights should be strengthened and the scope for individuals to
appeal against violations of such rights expanded. The last point is crucial to women, if they are
to achieve greater autonomy and more just relations between the sexes. The Council also
recommends that calls be made in Beijing for the adoption of a right of petition in respect of ESC
rights by making states party to the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Moreover, the Council supports the Dutch Government's efforts to
promote the adoption of an additional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
of Discrimination Against Women, which would accord both individuals and states the right of
petition.
<p>
The Council notes with approval that it is now recognised that improvement of women's
position is a goal in itself and not simply an instrument to other ends. Nevertheless, such an
improvement can help to resolve international problems such as poverty, environmental
degradation, violence, unemployment and social disintegration.
<p>
It is against this background that the NAR has made a large number of recommendations, both
for the fourth World Women's Conference and in the context of Dutch policy on development
cooperation. They include:
<ul>
<li>renewal of the social sector: restructuring programmes for developing countries should take
account of their potentially negative impact - both direct and indirect - on the position of
women; in a number of countries (particularly developing countries) the economic position of
women has done nothing but deteriorate, influenced by such factors as a fall in real wages; new
technologies have often resulted in an increased workload and less favourable working
conditions for women, who still have to combine work outside the home with domestic duties;
<p>
<li>conventional statistics and economic data, in which female labour has scarcely figured up
to now, should reflect the quantitative and qualitative contributions made by women to
development; the visibility of their contribution is an essential condition if their economic
situation is to be improved;
<p>
<li>defining sexual rights: at the 1994 Population Conference in Cairo these were discussed
only in the context of women's health and reproduction; the Council feels a broader framework
is needed, and defines sexual rights as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li>`Sexual rights (sexual in the sense of `sexuality', rather than `gender') could be understood
to mean the right of individuals - women and men - freely to interpret sexuality in their own
way, free from coercion, discrimination or violence, without this resulting in a violation of the
rights of others, sexual or otherwise.'
</ul>
<p>
<li>participation of women in political and social decision-making; the Council rejects `parity
democracy' (reserved seats in representative bodies), since it places women in a separate
domain; the important thing is to remove obstacles to participation by taking measures in the
fields of education, health care, work, child care, media and culture, and to redistribute
responsibilities between women and men;
<p>
<li>an international equal opportunities task force, which should be given a coordinating role
within the UN, with duties that would include reinforcing existing agencies in the fields of gender
and women in development; the World Women's Conference should modify the preliminary
studies for the `Agenda for Development' proposed by the Secretary-General of the UN; at
present they have too little to say about gender and women in development; in the context of
the proposed UN reforms, systematic attention should also be paid to a review of personnel
policy and `corporate culture' with a view to furthering the participation of women; the Council
is dubious about the value of target figures in isolation;
<p>
<li>an increase rather than a reduction in resources for Dutch policy on gender and
development; to be maintained after the review of Dutch foreign policy;
<p>
<li>priority for the implementation and evaluation of the impact of Dutch policy on gender and
women in development, rather than for the drafting of new policy; although the Netherlands was
one of the first to develop much of the policy and many of the instruments in this field,
operationalisation of activities and programmes has failed to keep pace. The Council warns of
the risk of producing too much policy; 
<p>
<li>strengthening the position of women in conflict prevention and settlement; many women
and NGOs are active throughout the world in the cause of disarmament and peace; at present
insufficient advantage is being taken of this potential resource.
</ul>
<p>
In an earlier comment on the UNDP's 1995 Human Development  Report (published on 16
August 1995), which referred, inter alia, to the use of a `gender inequality index', various
Council members drew attention to the risks of measurement and quantification without
sufficient operationalisation of activities which really increase women's opportunities and
potential.
<p>
The Council hopes that the fact the Conference is being held in Beijing will have a positive
impact on thinking in China on democratisation and human rights, especially its policy on
population. This policy has seriously undermined women's right of self-determination in respect
of their own bodies and their right to choose the number of children they wish to have and when
they wish to have them, by subjecting them to measures such as enforced abortion.
<p>
The NAR does not regard this fourth World Women's Conference as the last of its kind. Despite
the problems attendant on such a huge operation, another such conference should be placed on
the agenda for the year 2000, so that UN member states are made to comply with their
reporting obligations and NGOs given the opportunity to question governments on their progress.

Policy review and development cooperation:<br>Quality accorded priority</h2>
<h4><i>NAR Secretariat</i>
<p>
Source: <i>In Brief: Information from the NAR</i><br>No. 11, June 1995</h4>
<h5>The full text of the report in English, as well as a list of other publications, are available free of
charge from the Council's secretariat: E-mail: nar-dgis@dgis.minbuza.nl</h5>
</center>
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>

At the beginning of June 1995 the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) of the
Netherlands took the initiative of submitting to the Minister for Development Cooperation, J.P. Pronk,  an
advisory document (recommendation no. 105) entitled Review of foreign policy: a changing approach to
development cooperation in a changing world. It had been prompted to do so by a meeting which had taken
place the previous October with members of the Permanent Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Lower
House of Parliament.
<p>
<h3>Determining the place of development cooperation ('Major review')</h3>

The globalisation of the world economy has not left developing countries untouched. Quite the reverse in
fact; some of these nations are at the forefront of this process. Developing countries' economies are growing
more rapidly than those of rich countries, and this trend looks set to continue. They will increasingly fuel
the progress of the global economy. The familiar socioeconomic issues have been supplemented by other
questions which are making ever more urgent calls upon our attention: these include the refugee issue,
peacekeeping, the protection of human rights, democratisation and good governance. The question posed by
the National Advisory Council focuses on whether the instruments of Dutch foreign policy are still adequate
to deal with these issues, and on their effect on development cooperation.
<p>
Some of what were formerly styled Third World countries have reached or are about to reach a stage at
which they will no longer require special treatment in international relations, such as preferential measures
in the field of trade. It is easier for them to finance their development through the international private
capital market. These countries can be held responsible for poverty alleviation within their own borders.
Official flows of capital can be concentrated on a smaller group of developing countries. This should in no
way deflect efforts from the goal of global liberalisation of the movement of goods, services and capital.
While some economies are growing rapidly, others are being left behind. The gap is growing fast. Each
year sees an increase in the number of the poor; in the seventies this was estimated at 700 million, but their
ranks have now swelled to some 1,300 million. Of this latter group, 750 million men, women and children
go hungry every day. More attention must be given than hitherto to those left behind in the race for
development, to ensure that they do not entirely lose their chance of catching up. 
<p>
The end of the Cold War has shaken the international political map up considerably. Domestic and
international conflicts have broken out, altered or stopped. Undreamt of forces have been unleashed. The
stable picture hitherto presented by the international legal order has been replaced by a dynamic which
works sometimes towards peace, but more frequently towards increasing conflict and anarchy. An urgent
need has arisen to set the parameters for economic development, such as peacekeeping operations, good
governance, domestic legal order, social development, social integration and sustainability.
<p>
The National Advisory Council believes that the aim of Dutch foreign policy should be to promote the
international legal order and to achieve a more equitable distribution of the ecoscope. Development
cooperation is one of the instruments of that policy. In addition to the above-mentioned considerations, it is
important to realise that well-regulated international relations are very much in the Netherlands' interests.
Such a situation would be to the country's advantage, but it also places upon us obligations which cannot be
shrugged off as someone else's responsibility.
<p>
Development aid has become a staple instrument of international cooperation. Some countries, such as South
Korea and Taiwan, have benefited from it in the early stages of their development. Others have failed to
develop, for various reasons. Sometimes such failure has been attributable to the country itself; sometimes,
though, it has been the result of manipulative aid. In the past, the humanitarian principle underlying aid has
sometimes been made subservient to economic or political considerations. In this respect the current
tendency to remove the barriers formerly segregating policy fields may prove very beneficial - always
assuming that such policy 'mergers' lead to behavioural changes, that is.
<p>
The field of emergency aid/peacekeeping operations is a good example of an area which would benefit from
merged policy. The many organisations active in the field are in themselves efficient bodies. Efficiency
could however be improved by creating a single liaison office for international and national organisations in
situations where speed is of the essence. At present there is no such office in the Netherlands; the
implementation of such operations is channelled through various ministries and ministers. The National
Advisory Council proposes that the possibility of a liaison office, which would be responsible for policy
preparation and decision-making, be studied.
<p>
Another effect of globalisation has been an increase in the dissemination of information. In turn this has
greatly influenced people's aspirations with regard to participation in decision-making, good governance and
protection of human rights, and it has also made them more articulate and more ready to demand their
rights. Social development should be an independent element of development cooperation. Non-
governmental organisations can do much to promote such development. Efforts should continue to focus on
the development of criteria and the setting of priorities in the entire field of political and social development.
<p>
<h3>Tasks of development cooperation ('Minor review')</h3>

The central aim of development cooperation should be structural poverty alleviation within the parameters of
sustainability and political development (good governance, human rights, democratisation and social
development). An element of enlightened self-interest is permissible here, provided that it is not hidden, that
it is controllable, that it serves a purpose, and, most importantly, that it is subordinate to the real objective.
This aim should be furthered, just as in the eighties, by allocating 0.9 percent of GNP for traditional aid,
and 0.1 percent of GNP for international cooperation in the field of the environment. This should not affect
the aid currently being given to Central and Eastern Europe; this should be covered by a different budget.
<p>
In the long term, trade relations will assume greater importance to developing countries than aid relations.
However, the National Advisory Council believes that up to now many of the pleas for 'trade, not aid' have
amounted to empty rhetoric, since they have not been linked to proposals to achieve a greater liberalisation
of trade for developing countries. The Council is of the opinion that the Netherlands should take a stand
within the European Union for a simpler preferential system which will ultimately offer only the least
developed countries completely free access for all trade products (i.e. including textiles, clothing, steel and
agricultural products), gradually excluding the somewhat less poor countries from preferential measures.
The Netherlands must moreover make extra efforts to abolish European export subsidies which lead to the
dumping of agricultural products in developing countries. The agreements made during the Uruguay Round
must be honoured. This does not detract from the fact that the Netherlands should investigate scope for
going further than the dictates or agreements proceeding from 'Brussels'. Since protectionism can always
rear up unexpectedly, it is important to adhere, in the years ahead, to the agreed steps towards liberalisation
and to resist any delay on this point.
<p>
As indicated above, the Netherlands should adhere to the commitment it made in the framework of UNCED
to make 0.1 percent of GNP available for international environmental projects. However, the National
Advisory Council does not share the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and Environment's view that
these resources should mainly be deployed in Central and Eastern Europe and in East Asia. International
demand should take precedence over Dutch supply, here. The Council does, however, see scope for a
financial contribution to be made towards the cost of provision of Dutch expertise, say in the fields of soil
cleanup, water purification and environmental management. World Bank project funding would seem to
provide reasonable guarantees of environmental protection. The Council believes that the Netherlands should
ensure that other financial institutions, too, such as the Asian Development Bank, subject their proposals for
project financing to critical environmental assessment and that they recruit the staff necessary for such
assessment. The Dutch bilateral development aid programme should incorporate target figures for the total
amounts to be spent on environmental activities. It is important, though, to ensure that this sort of aid is not
increasingly made subject to requirements and conditions emanating from the Dutch political agenda.
<p>
Development projects come in many shapes and sizes. There is no simple formula for a successful project.
They often entail intricate intervention in complex social and political systems. A paucity of data makes it
difficult to predict the effects of such interventions (even in the Netherlands, where data are relatively
abundant, it is difficult to predict what the effects of an extra airport runway will be!). Nevertheless,
evaluation of thirty years of experience in development does provide some pointers. The provision of
development aid has worked better in Asia and Latin America than in Africa. And yet in the latter
continent, too, some successes have been achieved. Countries not torn by civil war have seen a sharp drop
in infant mortality rates, a great increase in life expectancy, great improvements in literacy rates and a far
greater number passing through higher education. These achievements are largely due to aid in the form of
vaccination campaigns, food programmes and education. The failures that have occurred have been in the
field of large-scale infrastructural projects, of industries which were technologically inappropriate and too
large in scale. The likelihood of failure increased greatly when the provision of aid became clouded by
economic interests and political motives.
<p>
The National Advisory Council feels that it is important for aid work to be done by professionals. It
recommends that an organisation's quality enhancement methods be viewed as a barometer when recruiting
bodies for aid work. To this end it will be necessary to ascertain whether they make use of independent
evaluation and reflect the results in their policy. Self-evaluation and self-criticism are qualities which are not
invariably possessed by aid agencies. The Council accordingly believes that the extent of the Netherlands'
voluntary contributions to international bodies should depend on the perceived quality of the organisation in
question and its evaluation methods. In the case of obligatory contributions the Netherlands and other
countries will have to insist that quality be adopted as the yardstick for increasing or reducing future
contributions. In theory, a wide range of NGOs qualify for aid, particularly as the Council would like to see
greater importance attached to a balanced programme of social development. It is against this background
that the Council urges a gradual increase in the share of co-financing organisations in the total development
budget. In general, these have proved an efficient aid channel, fulfilling the sustainable poverty alleviation
condition, and have in recent years worked towards quality improvement.
<p>
The Dutch economy is very much an open economy; a good proportion of our prosperity is derived from
international trade. And yet that openness is relative. Compared to other countries, our international contacts
tend to be restricted to ties with rich nations. If the sustainability of the Netherlands' links with developing
countries is to be promoted, the Council feels that new ways must be sought to intensify such relations. We
might approach other donors for advice on aid-initiated relations in the field of trade and investment.
<p>
What is the status of the quality of aid provided and the aid channels used by the Netherlands on a bilateral
basis? Over the years this has become ever more complex in nature, with a sharp increase in the number of
main aims, subordinate aims, and social and political requirements. Improvement of the quality of such aid
would, the Council believes, make both Dutch policy and the organisation of aid more transparent and
straightforward. In the interests of manageability and quality it would seem sensible to concentrate aid on a
smaller number of countries. With regard to Dutch bilateral aid, the Council is thinking in terms of ten
countries in which broad programmes of development aid could be set up, and twenty countries in which
only theme or sector programmes would be financed. The Council once again reiterates its earlier
recommendation to concentrate 80% of traditional aid in the poorest countries (with a per capita GNP of
less than USD 650). Development cooperation is very much a knowledge industry, and loss of quality and
fragmentation are inherent dangers. For this reason it is also recommended that special programmes
(environment, women, research, urban poverty, etc.) are integrated in the proposed country programmes.
The Council would stress here that it is not proposing that specific expertise in the said areas be lost, only
that it should be incorporated more effectively in the country programmes.
<p>
The quality of bilateral aid can also be enhanced through various personnel-related measures (aiming at
professionalisation) and by decentralising powers and staff. Staff recruited for the preparation, approval and
monitoring of aid should have considerable experience in the field of development cooperation. The rotation
of staff should also be restricted, in terms both of the length and location of their postings (e.g. possibly
only within regional clusters). It should also be possible to recruit personnel with both experience of
managing complex organisations and development expertise. If not, it will be necessary to consider setting
up a government agency for aid implementation. In the latter case, one will have to ensure that
implementation does not become too far removed from the Minister for Development Cooperation's political
accountability and control. Before setting up such an agency, it would be advisable to commission, in the
short term, a comparative study of other donor country practices in respect of management and the
implementation of decision-making in the field of development cooperation. Responsibility for identification,
supervision and disbursement of smaller sums should lie with the developing countries, and the Council
accordingly recommends that field offices be set up. The 'ownership' of projects and programmes could also
be better structured. The Council believes this could be achieved within the existing personnel establishment
and budget.
<p>
The new approach outlined above would, in the view of the Council, justify expansion of the Minister for
Development Cooperation's portfolio (perhaps specified under the heading of 'International Cooperation'). In
addition to his present responsibilities in the field of aid and cooperation, the minister would become
responsible for the issues relating to development cooperation, namely international trade*, the global
environment and political concerns (good governance, human rights, democratisation and social
development). In order to cope with this extended mandate, the Minister could make greater use of
professional aid agencies in the implementation of the aid programme.
<p>

trade' in this recommendation.

<b>
At the beginning of March 1994 the 104th report of the National Advisory Council for Development
Cooperation (NAR) was presented to the Minister for Development Cooperation, Mr J P Pronk. The report
deals with the relationship between population and development and is part of the preparation for the
International Conference on Population and Development which is to be held in Cairo in September
1994.</b>
<p>
<h3>Summary of the problem and the issues addressed in the report</h3>

How can the Netherlands contribute towards formulating and implementing population policy within the
framework of Dutch development cooperation policy? The Minister for Development Cooperation requested
the NAR to produce a report as part of the preparation for the International Conference on Population and
Development to be held in Cairo in September 1994. The Dutch delegation will be expected to present a
standpoint on abortion, the relationship between women's right not to have children and demographic aims
and the relationship between the rights of women and the responsibilities of men. The report covers these
issues.
<p>
Population policy affects people in their most intimate relationships, beliefs and values and survival
strategies, which makes it a difficult and often emotionally-charged subject. Nevertheless, it seems that
international agreement is being reached on the need to slow down the world's population growth. This is
closely related to growing interest in sustainable development in that population growth is placing an
increasing burden on the environment. However, unsustainable patterns of production and consumption are
equally harmful. The essence of the problem lies in the interrelationship between population growth and
patterns of production and consumption which are characterised by unequal distribution of resources and
power.
<p>
For the poor, children can represent security for the future. At the same time, however, it is the poor who
have limited reproductive choice owing to lack of access to family planning services. In addition, limited
access to education, health care and the labour market are further factors which lead to high fertility rates.
Population policy must therefore be embedded in strategy for combating poverty and vice versa. It is
difficult to fight poverty if the population is growing at a consistently high rate. This situation is making it
increasingly difficult to improve the lives of large sections of the population. It is clear that population
growth and poverty are interrelated.
<p>
However, population growth is not always the only problem or indeed the main problem. Geographic
distribution, the aging of the population and migration all affect population structure and give rise to
problems. Urbanisation too is becoming an extremely urgent problem. There are therefore many aspects to
the population problem and more than one solution is required.
<p>
The fertility rate, or the number of children born to each woman, varies widely depending on the
socioeconomic position of women, their cultural and religious environment and prospects, and, naturally,
those of men. However, inequality between men and women in both personal and public life is a major
influence on reproductive patterns. The joys and responsibilities of childbearing and the rearing of children
are very unequally distributed in most countries. The way in which population policy is formulated and
implemented tends to reduce women to instruments of birth control policy. Women's autonomy is restricted
and furthermore, they are burdened with the full responsibility of reducing the rate of population growth.
The needs of women are not considered enough when population policy is translated into family planning
programmes.
<p>
It is now recognised that family planning is no longer only a means of keeping the population rate down, but
that it forms part of a package of measures aimed at improving the reproductive health of women.
Reproductive health care includes the provision of contraceptives, information on the prevention, diagnosis
and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and other infections, and services to deal safely with
unwanted pregnancies. Recent information from organisations active in the field of population policy such as
UNFPA, the World Bank and the Population Council, reveal that they now use qualitative rather than
quantitative factors (including treating people with respect and providing good guidance) to measure the
success of their family planning programmes.
<p>
The trend in international debate is to place these facilities in a broader perspective: family planning is only
one means of slowing the population growth rate. After all, this growth is a result of the fertility rate and of
demographic momentum (the increase in the number of men and women of childbearing age as a result of
the rise in the birth rate of the previous generation). Family planning is effective only where there is a
desire to reduce the fertility; it has no effect on the other factors of growth. This means that population
policy must also be included as an aspect of broader socioeconomic policy, while education and health
policy must be matched to the aims of population policy. A woman's education is still the most accurate
indicator of the number of children she will bear: the more education, the fewer children.
<p>
Infant mortality is also a factor which causes uncertainty. More funds should therefore be allocated to
education and health and socioeconomic policy should ensure that the allocation of tasks between men and
women is changed. Provisions for old age not only influence the number of children people have but also
meet the needs of the increasing numbers of old people in developing countries. The aging of the population
requires that the special needs of the elderly, of whom women form a high percentage, be taken into
account when funds are allocated. Urbanisation calls for facilities for reproductive health which are
appropriate to the specific living conditions and varied patterns of sexual and reproductive behaviour in the
cities.
<p>
<h3>Conclusions and recommendations</h3>

People must be given access to good health care and reproductive health care facilities so that they are able
to decide how many children they wish to have. This applies particularly to women who have only limited
control over their sexual relations and cannot take their own decisions on fertility. The fact that girls and
women have only limited access to education and the traditional allocation of roles in family life define the
framework within which they can make choices on having children. Legislation in many countries only
serves to reinforce the limited choice they have.
<p>
The Council believes that family planning should be part of reproductive health care. It is essential that
family planning programmes offer a wide range of high quality services. If the wrong type of birth control
is prescribed (for example the pill where there are contraindications or the IUD where there is an infection
present) or not enough information provided on side effects, women are going to be very reluctant to
participate in programmes. In addition to birth control, diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted
diseases and infections of the reproductive tract should be provided. Reproductive health care services
should also be available to young people and single women. Information campaigns must make men aware
that they are responsible for their sexual behaviour and their fertility, and the consequences thereof.
<p>
Safe abortion should be included in this package. Unwanted pregnancies may result from the failure of
contraceptive devices or from the lack of effective birth control methods. However, they are often the result
of violence perpetrated against women: rape either by members of the family or others or during a war
situation. The Council is of the opinion that governments should be made aware of their responsibilities
towards women's health and that they should make safe abortion available by legalising it.
<p>
The Council objects on paying target groups to limit fertility on grounds of principle and would emphasise
the enormous practical problems involved in applying this instrument. In practice there is no cost-effective
method of guaranteeing that this type of instrument would not be open to abuse, given the context of
corruption, poverty and the low status of women in which it would be applied. The Council is, however, in
favour of refunding some expenses, for example travel expenses, incurred in visiting a family planning
clinic. This would make services more accessible.
<p>
The Council recommends more support for research in order to broaden and improve the range of
contraceptives available. This applies particularly to research into male contraceptives. The Council also
recommends support for research into methods over which women have control, for example, a gel which
provides protection against HIV infection. Two forms are being developed: one provides protection only
against HIV and the other is also a contraceptive. The Council believes that research into immunological
vaccines for women is less desirable as there would be risks involved in their use and women would have
little control over such methods.
<p>
When population policy is formulated specific ways of giving greater power to the grassroots should be
sought. The Council is of the opinion that substance should be given to mechanisms for ensuring
participation in population programmes. The assistance of advisory or supervisory committees which
represent private organisations, NGOs and women's organisations in particular should be sought in
formulating and implementing programmes. Ways of evaluating participation should also be built into policy
programmes.
<p>
It is the Council's view that frank debate with the Roman Catholic church should take place on the
consequences of its doctrine on sexuality and contraception.
<p>
The Council would point to the common aspects in the approaches of environmental and women's
movements. These are clear if one examines critically the present patterns of development from a sustainable
development perspective. It is not possible to alter these patterns without changing the existing balance of
power and inequality. Survival strategies and the participation of the poor are central features of this type of
approach. Common strategy should be geared towards achieving political undertakings to spend more money
on a broad, integrated approach to population issues.
<p>
As far as the dialogue on population issues between the governments of the industrialised countries and the
developing countries of the South are concerned, the North should not evade its responsibility for sustainable
development. Unsustainable patterns of production and consumption in the North are placing a
disproportionate burden on the world's resources. The population issue should not result in a new
conditionality being introduced into development relations, but in equal dialogue.
<p>
Two members of the Council, who are also members of the working group which prepared the report,
support most of the report but have different views on a number of points, under which are also included
the idea to actively propagate a broad and consistent strategy at the Cairo conference and the offer to
elaborate on the operationalisation of a broad population policy in a future recommendation. The most
important different views can be summarised as follows:
<ul>
<li>The most serious problem by far is still rapid population growth and problems such as urbanisation
and the aging of the population are merely extensions of the main problem. Attention should therefore be
devoted primarily to population growth.
<li>The recommended measures are therefore unlikely to succeed in alleviating the population problem.
While growth is still so rapid, all acceptable means should be deployed to reduce it, including providing
target groups with financial rewards to reduce fertility. This should be subject to certain safeguards.
<li>Clearer priorities should be set, particularly relating to the nature and extent of family planning
facilities and related information campaigns.
</ul>

<p>
Le pr&#233;sent r&#233;sum&#233; contient une description du probl&#232;me tel qu'il a &#233;t&#233;
identifi&#233; par le Conseil, les r&#233;sultats de l'analyse de la question et de la politique actuelle, les
conclusions du Conseil et les recommandations concernant la politique du ministre de la Coop&#233;ration
au d&#233;veloppement.
<p>
<h3>La croissance des villes et de la pauvret&#233; urbaine dans le Tiers-Monde</h3>

Selon les pr&#233;visions des Nations Unies, 51 % de la population mondiale vivront dans les villes en l'an
2000: ce chiffre atteindra m&ecirc;me les 65 % en 2025, date &#224; laquelle la population mondiale sera
de 8,4 milliards de personnes, 4,4 milliards de cette population vivant dans les villes des pays en
d&#233;veloppement. Ce sont les villes, - aussi bien les villes principales que celles de moyenne importance
-, des pays en d&#233;veloppement notamment d'Asie et d'Afrique qui conna&icirc;tront une croissance
explosive. Du fait d'une structure d&#233;mographique d&#233;s&#233;quilibr&#233;e - grand nombre de
migrants jeunes et exc&#233;dents d&#233;mographiques &#233;lev&#233;s - la population continuera
encore longtemps d'augmenter plus rapidement dans villes qu'&#224; la campagne, m&ecirc;me si l'exode
rural devait se faire moins important.
<p>
On assiste &#224; une augmentation du pourcentage de la population urbaine vivant au-dessous du seuil de
pauvret&#233; en Am&#233;rique latine, en Afrique et en Asie. Si la population du Grand Sa&otilde;
Paolo a cr&ucirc; de 44 % entre 1970 et 1980, celle des quartiers populaires a augment&#233; de 446 %
dans la m&ecirc;me p&#233;riode. En 1985, plus d'un tiers des citadins vivait au-dessous du seuil de
pauvret&#233; en Asie (au Bangladesh, m&ecirc;me 86%). M&ecirc;me dans les pays d'Asie de l'Est et
d'Asie du Sud qui connaissent une croissance rapide de leur &#233;conomie, 10 % de la population urbaine
vit au-dessous du seuil de pauvret&#233;.
<p>
La pauvret&#233; absolue, mesur&#233;e en termes de revenus, est encore la plus importante dans les
campagnes. Et selon les statistiques, le niveau des infrastructures est plus &#233;lev&#233; en ville
qu'&#224; la campagne. Toutefois, un nombre croissant de citadins pauvres sont victimes de la
concentration de facteurs de pauvret&#233; interd&#233;pendants. La "vuln&#233;rabilit&#233;" est ce qui
caract&#233;rise principalement leur existence selon la perception des citadins pauvres eux-m&ecirc;mes.
Les citadins pauvres n'ont d'ordinaire pas acc&#232;s aux structures d'enseignement, aux soins de
sant&#233;, &#224; un logement ad&#233;quat, au cr&#233;dit ni &#224; d'autres facilit&#233;s de
travail et de revenu. Dans la plupart des villes du Tiers-Monde, une grande partie de la population active est
sans travail ou n'a qu'un travail temporaire; dans les villes, la population active - entre 15 et 65 ans -
cro&icirc;t g&#233;n&#233;ralement plus rapidement que l'ensemble de la population. L'offre de travail
des pouvoirs publics et des grandes et moyennes entreprises a diminu&#233; fortement dans les
ann&#233;es 80 dans un certain nombre de pays en d&#233;veloppement. La chute des salaires r&#233;els
dans le secteur public et dans les grandes entreprises et le nombre &#233;lev&#233; de ch&ocirc;meurs ont
&#233;galement fait baisser les salaires r&#233;els dans le secteur dit informel. La protection sociale des
travailleurs a s&#233;rieusement d&#233;clin&#233;.
<p>
Les citadins pauvres manquent de r&#233;seaux sociaux, d'influence sur les d&#233;cisions politiques et de
contr&ocirc;le sur leurs conditions de vie. Les administrations urbaines ne poss&#232;dent pas, en
g&#233;n&#233;ral, la capacit&#233; de management ni les moyens pour s'attaquer efficacement &#224;
ce probl&#232;me complexe. De nombreux citadins pauvres n'en parviennent pas moins &#224; rehausser
effectivement leur niveau de vie. Dans un certain nombre de villes, des organisations d'habitants de
bidonvilles r&#233;ussissent souvent &#224; atteindre des objectifs tr&#232;s concrets (logement, eau). Les
conditions de vie m&#233;diocres des pauvres des villes se caract&#233;risent &#233;galement par des
probl&#232;mes psychosociaux: stress, d&#233;sorientation, instabilit&#233; et incertitude, renforc&#233;s
par les espoirs d&#233;&#231;us et l'inad&#233;quation entre le revenu et les tentations de la ville. Une
situation qui conduit souvent &#224; des explosions sociales, &#224; des formes de violence et de
criminalit&#233; - dont les jeunes sont tant les auteurs que les victimes -, &#224; la maltraitance des
enfants et &#224; la violence envers les femmes dans les m&#233;nages.
<p>
<h3>Les groupes les plus touch&#233;s</h3>

Le cercle vicieux de la marginalisation dans les villes touche principalement trois groupes de pauvres.
<ul>
<li>Les m&#232;res, notamment celles qui assurent le revenu d'une famille pauvre: les m&#233;nages
entretenus par les femmes. La mauvaise qualit&#233; de l'alimentation, de la sant&#233; et du logement
dans les bidonvilles, les longs temps de travail et les longs trajets affectent le plus les travailleuses enceintes.
<li>Les enfants des rues. En 1992, les enfants et les jeunes de 0 &#224; 24 ans constituaient 55,8 % de la
population des pays en d&#233;veloppement (en Afrique, 65 %). Le faible revenu familial des pauvres,
l'acc&#232;s limit&#233; au travail et la d&#233;sint&#233;gration de la famille jettent de plus en plus
d'enfants &#224; la rue. Selon les estimations, ils seraient actuellement quelques dizaines de millions de par
le monde. Les plus vuln&#233;rables sont encore une fois les filles de 12 &#224; 16 ans, et les
pr&#233;adolescents. Les enfants des rues sont contraints de se d&#233;brouiller tout seuls et tombent dans
la criminalit&#233; et la prostitution; ils sont utilis&#233;s par les cartels de la drogue et, en
Am&#233;rique latine, ils sont expos&#233;s &#224; la violence de la police et des escadrons de la mort.
<li>Les jeunes sans emploi. Le ch&ocirc;mage est particuli&#232;rement &#233;lev&#233; parmi les
jeunes jusqu'&#224; 25 ans. Le secteur informel et les petites entreprises leur sont peu accessibles; ils se
trouvent en outre en concurrence avec les adultes devenus ch&ocirc;meurs dans le secteur formel.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>La politique actuelle de lutte contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine</h3>

Dans son avis, le Conseil r&#233;pertorie les politiques d'un grand nombre d'acteurs dans le domaine de la
lutte contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine. Il constate que les priorit&#233;s des pays en d&#233;veloppement,
des donateurs multilat&#233;raux et du ministre n&#233;erlandais de la Coop&#233;ration au
D&#233;veloppement ne concordent pas sur tous les points. Les autorit&#233;s des pays en
d&#233;veloppement ne consid&#232;rent qu'exceptionnellement le probl&#232;me des citadins pauvres
comme un probl&#232;me distinct. Une organisation comme la Banque Mondiale situe, elle aussi, la lutte
contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine dans le cadre g&#233;n&#233;ral du d&#233;veloppement urbain. Bien
que les priorit&#233;s politiques des Pays-Bas - travail et revenu, habitat et am&#233;lioration de
l'administration - ne soient pas diff&#233;rentes des priorit&#233;s des organisations multilat&#233;rales,
la forte orientation de la politique n&#233;erlandaise actuelle vers la lutte directe contre la pauvret&#233;
constitue une exception.
<p>
En r&#233;sum&#233;, le Conseil constate, en ce qui concerne la politique n&#233;erlandaise de d&#233;veloppement:
<ul>
<li>que la politique de d&#233;veloppement &#224; l'&#233;gard de la lutte contre la pauvret&#233;
urbaine est formul&#233;e comme une politique d'accompagnement, non seulement par rapport &#224; la
politique de presque toutes les organisations multilat&#233;rales concern&#233;es, mais aussi par rapport
&#224; celle de la plupart des pays en d&#233;veloppement.
<li>que la politique dans son ensemble n'est pas explicitement ax&#233;e sur les probl&#232;mes du
ch&ocirc;mage parmi les jeunes et sur l'absence de formation professionnelle, sur la situation des femmes
dans les villes et le probl&#232;me de l'environnement urbain, ni sur les possibilit&#233;s
particuli&#232;res qu'offre la politique n&#233;erlandaise pour aider &#224; r&#233;soudre les
probl&#232;mes dans les villes d'importance secondaire. D'apr&#232;s les publications, il n'appara&icirc;t
pas que les programmes prioritaires "Les femmes et le d&#233;veloppement" et "L'environnement" ont
int&#233;gr&#233; l'aspect urbain dans leurs activit&#233;s. Le Conseil estime que le ch&ocirc;mage des
jeunes est un domaine important auquel on n'a toujours pas accord&#233; d'attention.
</ul>
<p>
Le Conseil reconna&icirc;t l'importance des programmes de la FMO (soci&#233;t&#233; financi&#232;re
n&#233;erlandaise pour les pays en d&#233;veloppement) et du programme PUM (programme de
d&#233;tachement de managers) pour g&#233;n&#233;rer de l'emploi dans les pays en
d&#233;veloppement.
<p>
<h3>Les principes de la politique de la lutte contre la pauvret&#233;</h3>

La principale conclusion du Conseil est que, vu la nature et l'urgence croissante qu'il y a &#224; combattre
la pauvret&#233; urbaine, il est n&#233;cessaire de formuler une politique distincte &#224; cet
&#233;gard. Le Conseil part du principe que la politique de lutte contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine fait partie
int&#233;grante de la politique g&#233;n&#233;rale de d&#233;veloppement n&#233;erlandaise.
<p>
Le Conseil consid&#232;re que l'aide bilat&#233;rale n&#233;erlandaise pour la lutte contre la
pauvret&#233; urbaine doit se limiter aux villes qui ne comptent pas plus de un ou deux millions
d'habitants, ne serait-ce que pour la simple raison que les Pays-Bas ne peuvent pas s'appuyer sur une
exp&#233;rience dans l'administration de villes plus grandes. &Eacute;tant donn&#233; la nature
structurelle du probl&#232;me, les Pays-Bas devront opter pour une coop&#233;ration de longue
dur&#233;e avec des "villes cibles". Le Conseil est &#233;galement d'avis que la politique
n&#233;erlandaise de lutte contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine doit cibler son action sur trois groupes
principaux: les m&#233;nages entretenus par les femmes (women maintained households), les jeunes sans
emploi et les enfants des rues.
<p>
La politique n&#233;erlandaise doit &ecirc;tre &#233;labor&#233;e sur la base d'une vision large et
int&#233;gr&#233;e et d'une aide-programme proj&#233;tis&#233;e. Vu les interd&#233;pendances
&#233;voqu&#233;es plus haut, l'amorce d'une solution au probl&#232;me de la pauvret&#233; urbaine
exige des interventions politiques &#224; diff&#233;rents niveaux administratifs et de diverses natures: la
valorisation des ressources humaines pour augmenter la productivit&#233;, l'am&#233;lioration de
l'administration et du management, une politique macro-&#233;conomique; la cr&#233;ation
d'&#233;quipements sociaux, la promotion de la participation et de la constitution d'organisations de
citadins pauvres; l'investissement dans des activit&#233;s &#233;conomiques et dans les infrastructures, en
relation avec l'am&#233;lioration de l'environnement urbain.
<p>
Le Conseil attache une grande importance &#224; la stimulation de la croissance &#233;conomique qui est
une condition n&#233;cessaire (mais insuffisante) de la lutte contre la pauvret&#233; en
g&#233;n&#233;ral et contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine en particulier. Il est n&#233;cessaire d'augmenter
la productivit&#233; dans de nombreux pays en d&#233;veloppement, malgr&#233; le risque de
ch&ocirc;mage &#224; court et &#224; moyen terme que comporte cet objectif.
<p>
Le Conseil est d'avis que la politique n&#233;erlandaise de lutte contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine doit tenir
compte de la mesure dans laquelle la politique de d&#233;veloppement men&#233;e par les autorit&#233;s
des pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires int&#232;gre les cons&#233;quences qu'une telle politique
entra&icirc;ne pour les citadins pauvres.
Les Pays-Bas peuvent donc opter, sur cette base, pour une politique d'accompagnement ou de soutien de la
politique men&#233;e par ces autorit&#233;s ou organisations multilat&#233;rales, et pour le soutien de
certaines activit&#233;s d&#233;ploy&#233;es par exemple par des ONG locales. Le Conseil pense que
dans les pays o&ugrave; les autorit&#233;s nationales ne m&#232;nent pas de politique de redistribution, il
convient d'appuyer les ONG qui d&#233;fendent les int&#233;r&ecirc;ts des pauvres, dans le but d'amener
les gouvernements concern&#233;s &#224; revoir leur politique.
<p>
<h3>Recommandations</h3>

Le Conseil recommande d'intensifier le Programme de lutte contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine afin de
pouvoir r&#233;aliser l'approche int&#233;gr&#233;e pr&#233;conis&#233;e dans les recommandations.
<p>
Le Conseil recommande de faire usage si possible d'un "indice de pauvret&#233; urbaine" dans le choix
des villes cibles.
<p>
Le Conseil fait une distinction entre la lutte directe et la lutte indirecte contre la pauvret&#233;. Il entend
par lutte directe contre la pauvret&#233; les activit&#233;s qui sont entreprises en coop&#233;ration avec
les groupes cibles cit&#233;s ou &#224; leur initiative. La lutte indirecte contre la pauvret&#233; comprend
des activit&#233;s qui ont pour but d'am&#233;liorer la situation des groupes cibles, sur laquelle ceux-ci
n'ont ni influence ni contr&ocirc;le, mais d&#233;termine n&#233;anmoins leur destin&#233;e.
<p>
<h3>La lutte directe contre la pauvret&#233;</h3>

Le Conseil recommande de promouvoir la lutte directe contre la pauvret&#233; dans les villes en
continuant &#224; soutenir directement ou indirectement les ONG, qui visent &#224; encourager les
pauvres &#224; se r&#233;unir en organisations et &#224; assurer l'accueil des enfants des rues. Il est
&#233;vident que la mise en oeuvre de la politique en faveur des jeunes sans emploi exige une
coop&#233;ration avec les MFO (organisations n&#233;erlandaises de cofinancement), les entreprises
n&#233;erlandaises - aussi bien les syndicats que les organisations patronales - et la SNV (Association
n&#233;erlandaise d'assistance au d&#233;veloppement), qui participent d&#233;j&#224; &#224; de telles
activit&#233;s. Le Conseil recommande d'examiner quelles sont les possibilit&#233;s envisag&#233;es par
ces organisations pour contribuer &#224; la formation professionnelle des jeunes et dans quelle mesure les
entreprises locales peuvent &ecirc;tre impliqu&#233;es dans ce type d'activit&#233;s.
<p>
Le Conseil recommande que les Pays-Bas contribuent &#224; la mise en place de filets de protection
sociale provisoires du type utilis&#233; en Bolivie et en Jama&iuml;que. Un tel fonds de
d&#233;veloppement social (Social Development Fund) devra imp&#233;rativement satisfaire aux conditions
qui sont n&#233;cessaires pour que les fonds disponibles profitent directement en particulier aux groupes
cibles cit&#233;s. Bien que dans un certain nombre de pays les salari&#233;s fassent partie des groupes
vuln&#233;rables lors de l'apparition de ch&ocirc;mage, le Conseil estime qu'ils n'occupent pas une
position d'exception &#224; cet &#233;gard.
<p>
Le Conseil recommande de tenir compte, dans le dialogue politique avec les pays en d&#233;veloppement
sur le probl&#232;me de la pauvret&#233; urbaine, des consid&#233;rations suivantes relatives aux
conditions de logement et d'existence dans les quartiers populaires:
<ul>
<li>l'accroissement de la faisabilit&#233; et de la durabilit&#233; des activit&#233;s par la participation
de la population &#224; la planification et &#224; l'ex&#233;cution;
<li>l'octroi du droit au logement et des droits fondamentaux et am&#233;lioration de l'infrastructure
urbaine par l'approvisionnement en eau potable salubre, l'assainissement et l'enl&#232;vement des
d&#233;chets;
<li>la cr&#233;ation de possibilit&#233;s pour des activit&#233;s li&#233;es &#224; l'agriculture - par
exemple la culture potag&#232;re et l'&#233;levage de petit b&#233;tail - ou l'autorisation l&#233;gale de
ces activit&#233;s dans les quartiers populaires;
<li>le moyen d'amener les petites et moyennes entreprises des quartiers populaires, par des activit&#233;s
de conseil, &#224; am&#233;nager les processus de production de fa&#231;on &#224; r&#233;duire la
quantit&#233; de d&#233;chets industriels et &#224; am&#233;liorer les conditions de travail en particulier
des groupes cibles dans ces entreprises, et
<li>l'am&#233;lioration de la qualit&#233; des prestations de services des autorit&#233;s urbaines.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>La lutte indirecte contre la pauvret&#233;</h3>

Le Conseil recommande d'appuyer la politique de la Banque Mondiale et du FMI visant &#224;
am&#233;liorer la structure &#233;conomique et la politique macro-&#233;conomique des pays
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires. Il faut tenir compte &#224; cet &#233;gard des cons&#233;quences que cette
politique peut entra&icirc;ner pour les citadins pauvres. Au besoin, des activit&#233;s d'accompagnement
peuvent &ecirc;tre d&#233;ploy&#233;es, en particulier dans les villes cibles, par l'interm&#233;diaire du
canal bilat&#233;ral, sur la base d'une analyse de ces cons&#233;quences.
<p>
Le Conseil estime que la coop&#233;ration entre le Centre des Nations Unies pour les &#233;tablissements
humains (UNCHS), le Programme des Nations Unies pour le D&#233;veloppement (PNUD) et la Banque
Mondiale au sein du programme de planification urbaine (Urban Management Programme) m&#233;rite
d'&ecirc;tre soutenue davantage et recommande qu'on examine dans quelle mesure le choix des villes
&#224; op&#233;rer par les Pays-Bas et le recours &#224; l'expertise n&#233;erlandaise peuvent
&ecirc;tre pris en compte dans son ex&#233;cution. Vu l'absence de moyens des autorit&#233;s urbaines,
le Conseil recommande d'&#233;tudier dans quelle mesure les Pays-Bas peuvent participer aux Pr&ecirc;ts
de d&#233;veloppement urbain (Urban Development Loans) de la  Banque Mondiale, notamment  pour ce
qui est des volets relatifs &#224; l'am&#233;lioration de l'infrastructure urbaine.
<p>
Le Conseil recommande d'examiner sous quelles conditions il est possible d'amener des entreprises
n&#233;erlandaises &#224; investir dans des activit&#233;s &#233;conomiques dans les villes-cibles. Le
Conseil est convaincu que la demande de produits des petites entreprises est d&#233;termin&#233;e en
grande partie par les revenus des salari&#233;s des grandes et moyennes entreprises et des fonctionnaires.
<p>
Le Conseil recommande d'examiner s'il est possible de cr&#233;er par l'interm&#233;diaire des canaux
bilat&#233;raux et multilat&#233;raux, des conditions visant &#224; stimuler l'octroi de cr&#233;dits pour
la construction de logements au moyens de pr&ecirc;ts en devises locales. Il importe de poursuivre la
politique actuelle pour soutenir - surtout par le canal des ONG - des initiatives sur le plan de
coop&#233;ratives de cr&#233;dit.
<p>
<h3>&Eacute;tudes</h3>

Le ministre a &#233;galement demand&#233; au Conseil si des &#233;tudes sont n&#233;cessaires pour
augmenter l'efficacit&#233; de la politique de lutte contre la pauvret&#233; urbaine. Le Conseil a
identifi&#233; treize lacunes pouvant donner lieu &#224; une &#233;tude et estime qu'il est important,
dans chacune des &#233;tudes, d'int&#233;grer les perspectives des pauvres eux-m&ecirc;mes. Les cinq
principales lacunes sont les suivantes:
<ul>
<li>la perception du probl&#232;me urbain par les pauvres eux-m&ecirc;mes et les strat&#233;gies de
survie qu'ils ont d&#233;velopp&#233;es, en tant que points de d&#233;part de la politique;
<li>la conduite r&#233;guli&#232;re d'&#233;tudes dans les pays cibles et notamment dans les villes-
cibles sur les effets de la politique macro-&#233;conomique sur la pauvret&#233; urbaine;
<li>les conditions pour que les organisations de pauvres aient une influence r&#233;elle sur la politique
urbaine locale, dans le cadre de la politique des ONG et des administrations locales et nationales;
<li>le r&ocirc;le des ONG et des entreprises dans la formation professionnelle des jeunes;
<li>l'int&#233;gration et l'exclusion des migrants dans les villes et les strat&#233;gies de survie au
niveau des m&#233;nages, et en particulier des m&#233;nages entretenus par les femmes.

<html><head><title>A GUIDE TO AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL'S POSITION ON THE UN CONFERENCE ON WOMEN</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#oooooo" link="#238e23" vlink="#4a766e"><img src="amnesty_pix/amnesty_logo.gif"><br><i>The material that follows has been provided by </i><a href="amnesty.html">Amnesty International</a><hr><h2>THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS FOR WOMEN: A GUIDE TO AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL'S POSITION ON THE UN CONFERENCE ON WOMEN</h2><h3>What does Amnesty International want to come out of the UN Conference on Women?</h3> This is the first UN Conference on Women where human rights issues are on the agenda and Amnesty International is looking for a commitment in both words and action to improve the protection of those rights. The key issues for Amnesty International are: <ul><li>The universality and invisibility of human rights </ul><p>The Platform of Action, the main document that will emerge from the conference , still does not make a strong and clear statement that all women, wherever they live in the world or whatever their circumstances, should enjoy all the human rights and fundamental freedoms, and that all these rights are inextricably linked. This principle is expressed as the universality and indivisibility of human rights.<p>It is astounding that commitments on this very point made by 171 governments just two years ago at the 1993 UN World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 are barely visible in the Platform of Action. At that conference, governments adopted the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action which states:<ul><li>The human rights of women and the girl-child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of human rights. The human rights of women should form an integral part of the United Nations human rights activities, including the promotion of all human rights instrument relating to women. The World Conference on Human Rights urges Governments, institutions, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to intensify their efforts for the promotion and protection of human rights of women and the girl-child. </ul><p>At this stage, many governments have resisted attempts to affirm and build on the commitments to all human rights they made in Vienna, and at other global conferences on the environment, population and social development. The message many governments are sending is that they will not treat all human rights on the same footing , and in particular that they do not want to tackle human rights violations for which they have direct responsibility. <p><h3>Violence against women</h3>Until the most recent draft of the Platform of Action, state violence against women, such as torture, "disappearances", and extrajudicial executions , was barely mentioned. The current draft states explicitly that governments should "refrain from engaging in violence against women" and prevent and investigate such acts and punish those responsible including state agents. <p>What is still missing, though, is a statement that torture by state agents is one of the most common forms of violence suffered by women. For the Platform of Action to commit governments to eliminating this form of violence, it needs to include a strong exhortation for all government to ratify without any limiting reservations the Convention Against Torture and other relevant human rights instruments.<p>It must also urge them to take prompt steps to implement the Convention including a clear statement that any state agent suspected of being responsible for torture will be brought to justice.<p>This point is crucial not only because any attempt to stem violence against women must eradicate brutality by police and soldiers but also because any government which does not do so sends a message to others in its society that violence against women is not taken seriously. <p><h3>Armed Conflict</h3>Women are disproportionately the victims of human rights violations and abuses including rape and other torture, "disappearances" and summary or arbitrary executions during armed conflicts, a central point that the conference must take on board for it to make a real impact on the human rights violations suffered by women.<p>The conference must also recognize that both governments and armed opposition groups are bound by international humanitarian law , known as the laws of war , that prohibit rape and other forms of torture, as well as hostage taking, and extrajudicial execution. <p>Increasingly, rape is used by soldiers as a weapon of war, and the conference should specifically condemn such torture and governments should commit themselves to eliminating rape by their forces.<p><h3>How do human rights issues relate to the other key points of debate at the conference? </h3>The themes of the World Conference on Women , equality, development and peace - will not be achieved unless governments commit themselves to ensuring that women fully enjoy all human rights.<p>The rights to equality, development and peace are inextricably linked to civil and political rights because any woman who faces arbitrary imprisonment, torture, "disappearance", judicial or extrajudicial execution stands no chance of exercising any other of her rights. <p>The conference in Beijing will be the first opportunity for the world's governments to spell out how past commitments to the human rights of women can be implemented to achieve real and measurable change for women by the year 2000. <p><h3>What are the obstacles to achieving a commitment from governments on human rights protection?</h3>The major obstacles will be governments who ignore the urgent need for action on human rights protection for women in favour of vested political interests, and those who will ignore the fact that the state is a major cause of the violations of the human rights of women. <p><h3>Does Amnesty International believe that the outcome of the conference will make a difference to the human rights of women? </h3>It can make a difference if the governments at the conference build on, and do not roll back, their commitment to all human rights for women, and if they then take concrete action to promote and protect those rights when they leave Beijing and return to their countries. <p>The real test for the success of any major UN conference is not just what is said or agreed at the conference itself, but what takes place afterwards. The three previous world conferences on women have not dealt with the human rights of women , this is long overdue and we hope the conference will finally come to grips with human rights. <p>Amnesty International will judge the ultimate impact of the conference on whether governments ratify the various human rights instruments that are relevant to the protection of women, implement them by changing their national laws and policing, trial and other procedures, and, finally, whether human rights violations against women decrease. <p>Whatever the Platform for Action says, and we hope that governments will use this opportunity to make firm commitments to human rights, it is ultimately what governments do that will change the situation of women.<p>                    <hr>©Copyright: Amensty International<hr> <a href="index.html"><img src="amnesty_pix/amnesty_logo2.gif"> Amnesty International</a><hr></body></html>

<html><head><title>Planned Parenthood Challenges 1996/1</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><img align=left hspace=3 src="../ippf_pix/ippf_logo.gif"><h3>International<br>Planned<br>Parenthood<br>Federation</h3><i>The material that follows has been provided by <a href="../ippf_info.html">IPPF</a></i><br clear=left><hr><h1 align=center>Speaking out for youth in Kenya</h1><h3 align=center>by Joseph Karueru</h3><img align=left border=1 hspace=10 vspace=10 width=200 height=123 src="p31.jpg"><br>The issue of youth sexuality and reproductive health in Kenyaprovokes emotional and passionate reactions from concernedparties. Everyone agrees that young people are experiencingserious sexuality and reproductive health problems, manifestedby increasing numbers of school drop-outs due to teenagepregnancies, increased incidence of sexually transmitteddiseases (STDs) among adolescents, abortions and other socialrelated problems like drug abuse and family communicationbreakdown.<p>But attitudes to the appropriate responses differ.  There arethose groups who feel that providing any form of education andservices to young people on these matters will encouragepromiscuity and immorality among them. This standpoint ismainly shared by groups spearheaded by the Catholic Church. Other groups believe in empowering the youth with appropriateinformation on these matters to enable them make responsibledecisions.  <p>Some of the groups in the latter category have come togetherunder the Kenya Youth Initiatives Project to advocate foryouth reproductive health information and services in Kenya,adopting the slogan TETEA VIJANA, which is Swahili for 'SpeakOut For Youth'. The campaign initiative is spearheaded byYouth Serving Organizations in Kenya through the auspices ofthe National Council For Population and Development (NCPD)with the Family Planning Association of Kenya (FPAK) takingthe lead.<p>In 1992, a number of agencies including FPAK undertook acountrywide youth survey on behalf of the Government.  Amongits findings was one that the current environment forundertaking youth sexuality and reproductive health programmesin Kenya is hostile, confirming the protracted stalematebetween those for and against family life education for youth. Following the study, the Government launched a countrywideintervention, the Kenya Youth Initiatives Project, to addressits recommendations. <p>Although the family planning association had been in theforefront of supporting youth sexuality and reproductivehealth initiatives, the organization still lacked completeconsensus and there existed some hesitation and ambiguityabout what form youth services should take.  So FPAK organizedan open forum for staff and volunteers to review facts andfigures on the magnitude of the youth problems and FPAK's rolein resolving the issues, and come up with a common approachfor FPAK. At the end of the workshop the vast majority of theparticipants believed that FPAK should deliver information andservices to youth and provide leadership in advocating foryouth reproductive health.<p> Subsequently FPAK adopted a policy to provide reproductivehealth information and counselling to young people aged 10-24who are not yet sexually active in order to assist them indelaying the onset of sexual activity; to provide reproductivehealth information and services to the young people who aresexually active to help them prevent reproductive healthrelated problems; and to support the government of Kenya inintroducing Family Life Education (FLE) in schools, byactively undertaking FLE activities for in-and-out of schoolyouth, parents, teachers and other community and opinionleaders.  <p>With the youth policy in place, FPAK could confidentlyspearhead the implementation of the Kenya Youth InitiativesProject.  A project advisory committee was constituted, drawnfrom all youth serving organizations in the country, andchaired by the National Council for Population andDevelopment. As a first step, the issues and the problems thatlay ahead had to be considered. The legislative and policyenvironment of the issue had to be studied, and the perceptionand opinions of policy makers and public opinion leaders hadto be understood. The conclusions were that Kenya has nonational youth policy; that there are several contradictionsand discrepancies in Kenyan law governing social and medicalissues of the young people; and that Kenyan law is not clearon the definition of the child and the youth.<p>Furthermore, an opinion survey conducted with seniorpolitical, administrative and opinion leaders at local andnational levels showed that most of them were aware of theproblems young people experienced in relation to sexual andreproductive health and supported the provision of informationand services aimed at reducing these problems. However, mostof them were fearful of speaking openly for fear of politicaland social repercussions. Nevertheless, some of the leaders inthis study admitted encouraging their adolescent children touse condoms if they went out.<p>FPAK  developed a "Leaders Advocacy Strategic Pack",  anattractive package of IEC materials containing a set of fivefactsheets with well-illustrated and facts and figures onyouth sexual activity, teenage pregnancy, HIV/AIDS and otherSTDS, abortions and harmful practices facing girls; a booklet,with text and graphics on the same issues; and a wallchartwith coloured graphics.<p>In order to encourage leaders to make the time to read thematerial, and ensure it made enough of an impression on themthat they subsequently took action, district youth advocateswere recruited.  Each advocate would sensitize theirdistrict's leadership, by giving presentations on youthsexuality and reproductive health, and distribute the advocacystrategic pack.  They would report back so their interactionswith leaders could be collated at the project secretariat.  Atotal of 39 district advocates, chosen by a district selectionpanel, underwent a six-day intensive training course onadvocacy skills, conducted by Johns Hopkins University andAdvocates for Youth.  <p>In October and November 1995, the National Council forPopulation and Development (NCPD), with funding from theUnited Nations Population Fund, conducted five regionalPopulation Conferences, with the theme `Population andSustainable Development'. The major purpose was to discuss andreceive recommendations from leaders on the review of thecountry's population policy guidelines of 1984. Through theinitiatives of the KYIP project, youth reproductive health waspushed as a main item for discussion. Using the advocacystrategic pack, the participants were taken through the litanyof youth reproductive health problems, their social andmedical consequences and the need to put in placeinterventions which can help reduce the sufferings of theyouth. The youth agenda provided the most spirited debate onwhat needs to be done. At the end of the conferences, it wasclear that Kenya needed a youth reproductive health policy.<p>For a long time, it had not been possible to create a forum onyouth sexuality, but in March 1995 FPAK brought togetherpeople of divergent views on youth programmes in a one-dayworkshop. Among those represented were the Kenya Government(with keynote addresses by the Vice President and Ministerresponsible for Population issues and the Ministry ofEducation); the Catholic Church; Muslim leaders; and theNational Council of Churches of Kenya.<p>Though there was no general consensus, it was clear there wereseveral areas of shared interests.  It was agreed that regularforums of such nature be organized to encourage dialogue andfind ways and means of exploiting the common ground foradvancement in this matter.<p>In July 1995, the Kenya Youth Initiatives Project co-sponsored a national youth workshop for the National Councilof Churches of Kenya (NCCK) and this attracted over 100 youngpeople and over 400 senior clergy including bishops andmoderators of the Protestant Churches in Kenya. The workshop'sagenda centred on the role of NCCK in addressing reproductivehealth problems.  Presentations examined these problems asthey affect the welfare of the youth, and looked at thereligious standpoint on these matters. There were also opendiscussions in groups and agreement was reached that NCCKwould make a commitment to support the move to introduceFamily Life Education in schools and support pragmaticinterventions which aim at improving the health and well-beingof youth in Kenya. It was also emphasized that the memberchurches should play a more active role in promoting thesexual and reproductive health of young people. Indeed thechurches were requested to do more teaching and less preachingon these issues.<p>From an analysis of media coverage of youth reproductivehealth issues, it was apparent that either the mass media wasignoring or did not understand the seriousness of the issuesat hand. The coverage provided was scanty and did not provokethe readership of these publications to take any action.Forums to sensitize and brief the senior editors andjournalists of these publications were conducted and facts andfigures including implications and consequences of the youthsexual and reproductive health were presented and discussed.As a result the print media gave a commitment to giveprominence to these matters in a manner that would attract theattention of those who are in the position to initiaterelevant programmes and policies. It is evident that sincethese interventions there has been a dramatic shift towardfavourable coverage of these issues.<p>However, the project is aware that still greater efforts willbe needed to sustain the current momentum of a more receptiveenvironment in favour of youth sexuality and reproductivehealth information and services.<p><hr><p>©Copyright IPPF<br><font size=-1>Picture: &copy;IPPF </font><hr><img align=left src="../ippf_pix/ippf_logo2.gif"> <a href="index.html">PPC 1996/1 Contents</a><br><a href="../index.html">IPPF Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

<title>Britain's relations with Africa primarily via South

Britain's relations with Africa primarily via South Africa</h2>
<h4>by <i>Tjitske Lingsma</i>
<p>
Full text of an article from <i>Vice Versa (a quarterly magazine on
development work published by SNV)</i><br>Vol 29, No. 5, 1995: page
5</h4>
</center>
<hr>
<b>Britain's African policy is dictated by pragmatic and economic
interests. Beyond this, London shows very little interest in the
continent. The Queen, on the other hand, is happy to imagine
herself in the Golden Age of the former British Empire.</b>
<p>
"Awfully pragmatic", was how Richard Dowden described Britain's
African policy. Great Britain's relations with the African
countries are primarily determined by the economic advantage that
Britain is likely to derive. Just as in colonial times, commercial
interests constitute the most important motive for British
involvement with the continent. "The consideration is purely in
terms of the scope of British investments in a country. If these
prove to be insufficient, the country in question is immediately
demoted. Diplomatic representation and development aid are being
scaled down," says Dowden, the African correspondent for the
renowned journal "The Economist."
<p>
During the eighties British investments in Africa were sharply
reduced. This development was further speeded up by the end of the
Cold War. "At that stage Great Britain was very much focused on the
enormous possibilities and opportunities opening up in Eastern
Europe. Eastern Europe seemed to be the future," according to
Dowden. Subsequently London was preoccupied with crises such as the
Gulf War. And the "Continentþ also began to exert an increasing
pull, says Adotey Bing, director of the Africa Centre in London. "I
think Great Britain opted for a stronger integration in Europe and
that Africa will henceforth be viewed from a European perspective."
<p>
The result has been that in recent years London has increasingly
turned its back on Africa. Diplomats were recalled. African
students are no longer encouraged to come and study at British
universities. And even the support of English-language radio
broadcasts within the continent is being run down. "In Africa you
come across members of the general public who ask: "Why isnþt
England helping any more?þ But the British Government appears to be
turning a deaf ear," recounts Dowden. He goes on to say:
"Essentially, Great Britain is no longer interested in its former
African colonies."
<p>
There is also great concern regarding the threatened cut-backs on
development cooperation. Oxfam is anticipating a cut of at least 12
percent over the total budget (bilateral aid currently amounts to
0.3 percent of the Gross Domestic Product). The cuts are also bound
to hit Africa. "Development cooperation is less important for Great
Britain now that there is no longer the political motivation for
it," says Bing. "Now that the African countries can no longer
appeal to the Soviet Union, the British Government can afford to
reduce development aid. Thus," according to Bing, "development aid
is focused less on political issues and more on economics."
<p>
The lack of interest at government level certainly does not also
apply to the British people. Correspondent Dowden was amazed by the
public response to the catastrophe in Rwanda. "Never was so much
money collected in so short a time as for Rwanda. The public forced
the government to extend official development aid to Rwanda. The
Ministry of Foreign Affairs was forced to send a diplomat to keep
track of the money sent. The same diplomat is still in Rwanda. It
was exceptional that the public appeal forced a government to take
measures when it would otherwise have been inclined to do far
less," says Dowden. Bing predicts that on an economic level Africa
will not be entirely abandoned. At the end of the eighties British
exports to Africa only accounted for 4 percent of the total
exports, but there are signs that exports to Africa are increasing.
Imports from Africa have also increased. In its traditional role of
supplier of raw materials, the continent will continue to carry a
certain relevance. "In view of the fact that London aspires to the
role of international trading centre, Africa is inevitably of
interest since that is where the raw materials come from," says
Bing.
<p>
Economic British-African relations centre on a handful of
countries. The list is headed by South Africa, followed by Nigeria.
In third place comes Kenya. As far as Great Britain is concerned,
South Africa offers the greatest prospects. For years the British
Government was at odds with the international community because
London was opposed to the economic sanctions on Pretoria. But with
the new South Africa the gates are wide open. "On an economic
level, British relations with Africa will primarily be determined
via South Africa," says Bing. Dowden shares the same opinion,
according to Dowden: "British economic interests are mainly
concentrated in South Africa. Britain can use South Africa as a
base from which to do business with the rest of Africa, especially
with the region." 
<p>
In its political approach to Africa, Great Britain prefers to adopt
the role of observer, a strategy which is an extension of the
method of "indirect ruleþ which London applied to the colonies.
Only in the case that matters really go too far will the British
Government be heard to voice loud protest. Thus the Kenyan
Government was put under heavy pressure to initiate a
democratization process in the country. London is a great deal more
cautious in its dealings with the powerful giant Nigeria, the
preference being given to 'silent diplomacy." As a rule, the
British Government is reticent in its response to political issues.
When it comes down to it, even the most faithful of African allies
are abandoned entirely to their fate.
<p>
This was experienced by the former president of Gambia, Dawda
Jawara. For thirty years Jawara was on Britain's side. Never once
did he criticize British policy with regard to South Africa. "He
was seen by the British as a shining example of how an African
leader should be," recounts Dowden. The Gambia maintained close
ties with Great Britain. The land was blessed with British
investments and British tourists. When John Major became Prime
Minister, and was of the impression that he needed to show Africa
that the continent was important to him, he decided to invite
Jawara for a special state visit. "But when Jawara was overthrown
by five officers demanding higher salaries, Great Britain did
absolutely nothing," says Dowden.
<p>
The British, says Bing, appear to have accepted the fact that the
Great British Empire no longer exists. This, however, does not mean
that the old colonial sentiments have entirely disappeared. Former
Prime Minister Thatcher seemed to have the utmost difficulty in
accepting the idea that the British Empire was a thing of the past.
And though the Commonwealth, which was once one of the most
important political organizations in the world, has lost a great
deal of its strength, the memory of the old alliance between Great
Britain and its former colonies is still cherished. "It's a nice
get-together," grins Dowden in speaking of the annual Commonwealth
reunion, where Her Majesty makes small talk with heads of state
from the former colonies and where problems can be discussed in an
informal way. "she knows all the heads of state, their families and
the ministers. She speaks with them along the lines of: "I knew
your grandfather." Dowden goes on to say: "There is currently a
relatively strong movement in Great Britain to put an end to these
top-level gatherings, but the Queen is attached to them. Because
not only does it make her the Queen of England, it also makes her
a kind of world player."
<p>
That the alliance is also useful as far as Africa is concerned can
be seen from the expected extension of the Commonwealth group of
states. Cameroon and Mozambique have both become members of the
Commonwealth. "The reasons for this are not so much economic as a
question of language," says Bing. The Portuguese-speaking
Mozambique wants greater connection with the surrounding
English-speaking countries, but has scarcely enough money for
English tuition. The Commonwealth could be helpful to Mozambique in
this respect. Bing: "I can imagine that as an institution the
Commonwealth will cease to exist, yet it will continue to function
as a cultural network."

<h2>Report of the Inaugural Meeting<br>of the DSA European Development Policy Study Group<br>Manchester, 12 February 1996<p></h2>

Two papers were discussed.
<p>
<a href="lis_sum.htm">Ruth Lister</a> reviewed the performance of Lom&#233; IV and discussed the long-term prospects for this Coinvention. She noted the emphasis upon structural adjustment and the switch of priority from micro-economic projects to macro-economic change. Despite the greater importance of trade than aid to the ACP's, their trade preferences appear to have been of limited value and the margins of preference will significantly decline under the Uruguay Round.
<p>
Lom&#233; aid has been criticised for the slowness of its disbursement and both Stabex and Sysmin schemes are seen as having major inadequacies. Dr. Lister was also critical of the unclear relationship between the EU and the Member States and the weaknesses of the Commission's own internal organisation. Finally, she examined the Mid term Review and the "Horizon 2000" review of development cooperation policy. The failure of the latter to address the future of the Lom&#233; Convention is indicative of the lack of political support within the EU for its continuation. The role of France was seen as crucial in sustaining any support for its renewal.
<p>
Aidan Cox (ODI) reported on their recent <A HREF ="../../ecdpm/projects/aidsum.htm">comparative study of development aid</a> across the Member States of the EU. They found that the management costs of small projects were high, requiring six times as many staff. He argued that each Member State should specialise in its area of comparative advantage, but that this would require a common aid evaluation system. Unfortunately, their work suggests that all EU States share weaknesses in the same areas - eg. rural development. He was critical of the EU Commission for failing to address institutional issues, evaluate aid, or learn from experience. The Commission and other donors could also benefit from greater decentralisation of decision making and authority to their field officers.
<p>
He argued for a reorientation of EU aid towards the low income LDCs. This implies a reorientation of assistance towards South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa away from countries such as Israel and Singapore and away from smaller LDCs such as Jamaica. The findings will be published in June 1996 by the ODI under the title - "How European Aid Works: A Comparison of Management Systems and Effectiveness."

<title>Italian aid? No grazie! We'd rather have nothing at

Italian aid? No grazie! We'd rather have nothing at all</h2>
<h4>by <i>Jan van der Putten</i>
<p>
Full text of an article from <i>Vice Versa (a quarterly magazine on
development work published by SNV)</i><br>Vol 29, No. 5, 1995: page
9</h4>
</center>
<hr>
<b>Italy's African policy was based on blind self-interest. It
mainly took the form of colossal corruption and the financing of
local despots. Fortunately - both for Italy and for Africa - the
policy collapsed. There is now the wait for a new era.</b>
<p>
Long before they were allies in the Second World War, Germany and
Italy were already in the same camp: the camp of the colonial
losers. In both countries national unity was late to arrive. At
that stage the choice colonial morsels had long been shared out.
But Italy spotted the Horn of Africa, and with that, in 1889
Italian colonialism was born.
<p>
More than a hundred years later, Italy's colonial legacy is proving
a terrible embarrassment. For if the former Italian colonies are
today the scene of chaos and bloodshed, this is in no small measure
thanks to the former mother country. Italy chose to pursue a policy
in which its own self-interest took the form of colossal corruption
and the financing of local despots. Now that the true nature of the
policy has been revealed nothing more remains. If Italy still
harbours certain intentions where Africa is concerned it is solely
thanks to the efforts of private and clerical organizations.
<p>
In 1905 the Italian protectorate of Somalia was granted colonial
status. The dictator Mussolini, who was so desperately determined
to turn Italy into a great Power, embarked on a campaign of
conquest. In the war against Ethiopia (1935-1936) bombers were
used. After the Italian victory there emerged an Italian East
Africa consisting of the colonies of Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia.
The monumental work by the historian Angelo del Boca on Italian
colonialism completely destroys the myth of the relatively decent
comportment of the Italians in the Horn of Africa.
<p>
Before Italy had lost the Second World War, Italy had already lost
its colonies - but not its influence. In 1950 it was commanded by
the UN to guide Somalia towards emancipation. Ten years later the
country became independent. At that time it was not scourged by
armed bands and there were no starving children roaming the streets
of Mogadishu. No one could then have suspected that a civil war
would raise the country to the ground. Italy contributed powerfully
to the outbreak of the war with its support of the dictatorship of
Siad Barre, regardless of whether it was described as development
aid or went by some other name. This support stimulated the
rebellion of the clans which had no access to the Italian wealth.
<p>
Has Italy ever pursued an African policy worthy of the name? Of
course good relations were entered into with Algeria and Libya
since the neighbouring countries were important oil suppliers. This
was the reason that Italy was pro-Arab. This worked out well for
the great American ally, it meant that pro-Israeli Washington had
a link to the Arab world. Apart from that, after a brief period of
idealism, there was no policy at all, except that of profit.
Initiatives announced with a great deal of fanfare, such as the
formation of a cooperative of all of the countries around the
Mediterranean turned out to be nothing more than hot air.
<p>
Under the Ministers of Foreign Affairs Giulio Andreotti (Christian
Democrat, 1983-1989) and Gianni de Michelis (Socialist, 1989-1992)
Africa became a neo-colonial extension of national politics. Just
as the entire Italian society was divided up into party political
provinces, so Africa was carved up along party political lines.
Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya and Za&iuml;re were allocated to the Christian
Democrats, while Somalia, Algeria and Tunisia became the hunting
grounds of the Socialists. Morocco, Kenya, the Sudan and Senegal
were fraternally shared by the Christian Democrats and the
Socialists and, appropriately enough, the (ex-) communists of the
opposition were allocated their share of the booty in the form of
the Marxist countries of Angola and Mozambique.
<p>
The implications of this division? An entrepreneur wishing to do
business with Ethiopia first had to hand over a percentage to the
Christian Democrat Party. A development project in Somalia? The
palms of the socialists first needed to be greased. An Italian
hospital for Angola? Permission first had to be purchased from the
communist executives in Rome. The remainder of the developing world
was divided up along the same lines. But Italy focused most of its
attention on Africa, and within Africa on the former colonies. From
1979 to 1992 Italy set aside 42 trillion Lire for development aid.
Calculated at the current very much devaluated exchange rate that
still amounts to 42 billion guilders. The government proudly
announced that no other country in the world was doing as much in
terms of development aid as Italy. That was in the time that De
Michelis declared that Italy had become the fourth great world
power. The majority of the development money was intended for the
former colonies of Somalia and Ethiopia. Development of some sort
may well have taken place, but it had little to do with the
population. In the period from 1980 to 1987, the years of the most
intense Italian aid to Somalia, income per capita fell by
two-and-a-half percent.
<p>
The colonial leaders from the time of fascism may be accused of
many things but not of ignorance. The neocolonials of the political
parties, on the other hand, didn't know the first thing about it.
Actually, they didn't need to as long as they were able to add up,
especially in their own favour. Italian development aid finally
went under in a sea of scandal. It was rescued by examining judge,
Vittorio Paraggio. 
<p>
How hard Paraggio worked can be assessed from the fact that
ex-Socialist leader Craxi, the symbol of national corruption,
attributed to him a whole file of poisonous insinuations. Despite
calls for extradition, Craxi is still sitting high and dry in
Tunisia, where he has little need to worry about the possibility of
extradition. After all, he's a close friend of the Tunisian
president who still remembers the Italian's Socialist "development
aid."
<p>
Of every three aid programmes, at least two failed, assuming it was
ever the intention that they should succeed. Many projects were not
even begun or never come off, or they proved unusable or were found
to be full of defects. As a rule, preliminary studies were
dispensed with. As were invitations for tenders and controls. More
than likely because everything was furtively arranged.
<p>
The examples are as revealing as they are monotonous. A useless dam
in Mozambique. An unusable textiles factory in Ethiopia. A
superfluous university in Somalia. A huge central hospital in a
region populated by nomads. A chemical fertilizer factory where
there was no electricity. Hundreds of silos of unusable material.
The export of redundant, unusable or harmful products.
<p>
In Somalia the rate applying for backhanders could rise as high as
17 percent. This money generally found its way into the coffers of
Siad Barre and his family and closest colleagues. General Aidid and
other mass murderers were also on the payroll of the Italian
development aid. Food aid was traded for weapons to support the war
in Somalia and other countries.
<p>
The most expensive (700 million guilders) and the most disputed
Italian development project, the clearing of an area of twenty
thousand hectares in Ethiopia, was a service to the dictator
Menghistu. Most of the eighty thousand Ethiopians employed on this
Tana-Beles project were the political opponents of Menghistu, who
had deported them to this region. The project was destroyed in 1991
by the guerrillas of the Popular Liberation Front of Tigr&#233;.
<p>
Notorious also was the extortionately expensive road from Garoe to
Bosaso in Somalia, intended for the transport of the troops of Siad
Barre to the guerrilla territory.
<p>
The money went to dictatorial regimes, not to the people. Not a
single condition was attached to the money relating to
democratization or human rights. Siad Barre, a close friend of
Craxi, was supported by Italy up to the last. Little wonder, then,
that in the - failed - Restore Hope operation, the Italian
contingent was given anything but a warm welcome by the population.
Italy's African policy was based on blind self-interest and the
equally blind and shameless support of the regimes in power, since
that was the most effective way to achieve the ultimate objective
of the African policy: by fair means or foul and inexorably, the
Italians and their African friends had to profit by it.
<p>
Craxi had it right, when as personal representative of UN Secretary
General, P&#233;rez de Cu&#233;llar, he had to produce a report on the Third
World's foreign debt. "Whoever accumulates wealth," he wrote
cynically, "generally does so at the expense of someone else." At
the same time, Andreotti was heard to declare that Italy was
heading the battle on behalf of development.
<p>
Italy's old politics have collapsed, and as yet there are no signs
of a new order. Foreign policy is also a huge vacuum. And, as far
as Africa is concerned, it's just as well.

<h2>Silencing the Net - Summary</h2>
<img width=650 height=1 src="../../newsflash_pix/news_line.jpg"></CENTER><br><br clear=all><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Governments around the world, claiming they want to protect children, thwart terrorists and silence racists and hate mongers, are rushing to eradicate freedom of expression on the Internet, the international &quot;network of networks,&quot; touted as the Information Superhighway. It is particularly crucial now, in the early stages of vast technological change, that governments reaffirm their commitment to respect the rights of citizens to communicate freely. A G7 Ministerial Conference on the Information Society and Development to be held in South Africa from May 13-15, 1996 should be used as a platform to repudiate the international trend toward censorship and to express unequivocal support for free expression guarantees on-line.</P><P>Restrictions on Internet access and content are increasing worldwide, under all forms of government. Censorship legislation was recently enacted in the United States, the birthplace of the Bill of Rights as well as of this new communications medium and, for better or worse, a model for other nations' Internet policies. The Clinton administration claims the law will protect minors from &quot;indecent&quot; material and appears unconcerned that it will reduce on-line expression between adults to what may be deemed suitable for a child. Other democratic countries are following suit. The German phone company cut off access to all the sites hosted by an American Internet service provider (ISP) in an effort to bar Germans from gaining access to neo-Nazi propaganda on one of the sites it hosted. The governments of France and Australia have also indicated they may enact legislation to control Internet content.</P><P>Authoritarian regimes are attempting to reconcile their eagerness to reap the economic benefits of Internet access with maintaining control over the flow of information inside their borders. Censorship efforts in the U.S. and Germany lend support to those in China, Singapore, and Iran, where censors target not only sexually explicit material and hate speech but also pro-democracy discussions and human rights education. Proposals to censor the Internet wherever they originate violate the free speech guarantees enshrined in democratic constitutions and international law. In the attempt to enforce them, open societies will become increasingly repressive and closed societies will find new opportunity to chill political expression. </P><P>Because the Internet knows no national boundaries, on-line censorship laws, in addition to trampling on the free expression rights of a nation's own citizens, threaten to chill expression globally and to impede the development of the Global Information Infrastructure (GII) before it becomes a truly global phenomenon. Democratic countries, including the U.S. and Germany, that are pushing for the development of the GII will lack legitimacy in criticizing efforts by China to eliminate information that &quot;hinders public order&quot; or by Vietnam, where the &quot;the cultural aspect&quot; is cited as a reason to censor connections to pro-democracy discussions abroad. <B>1</B> <font size=2>(According to Nghiem Yuan Tinh, deputy director of Vietnam Data Communication Company, &quot;The Internet must be controlled, not only for technical and security reasons but from the cultural aspect.&quot; &quot;Plan by Telecom Authorityto Exercise Control Over Internet Disturbs Foreign Investors and Agency,&quot; Financial Times (London), September 19, 1995.)</font></P><P>An issue closely related to censorship is that of access, which is to a large extent determined by the existing telecommunications system. According to a 1995 report by the Panos Institute, a London-based international non-profit organization specializing in development issues, </P><BLOCKQUOTE>Access requires a telephone line. Forty-nine countries have fewer than one telephone per 100 people, 35 of which are in Africa. India, for example, has 8 million telephone lines for 900 million people. At a global level at least 80% of the world's population still lacks the most basic telecommunications. <B>2</B> <font size=2>(The Internet and the South: Superhighway or Dirt-Track? (London: Panos Institute, 1995).)</font></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Opportunities to promote access have never been greater, however. New communications technologies are providing developing countries with an unprecedented means to leapfrog antiquated communication networks. </P><P>Limits on access are imposed by governments for a variety of reasons, including economic gain and political control. Some governments, including India and Saudi Arabia, have chosen to control the liberalizing effect of the Internet by denying access to entire segments of their populations, either through exorbitant charges or by confining access to select populations, such as universities. Rather than attempting to extend the Internet to a diverse group of citizens, these governments are striving to reap the economic benefits of Internet access without making it available to economically, socially, and politically disadvantaged groups, for whom it has the greatest potential for positive change. In some countries, such as Saudi Arabia, individuals who have Internet connections through foreign-owned corporations are able to elude these restrictions. </P><P>Even at this relatively early stage in the Internet's development, a wide range of restrictions on on-line communication have been put in place in at least twenty countries, including the following: </P><UL><LI>China, which requires users and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to register with authorities;<LI>Vietnam and Saudi Arabia, which permit only a single, government-controlled gateway for Internet service;<LI>United States, which has enacted new Internet-specific legislation that imposes more restrictive regulations on electronic expression than those currently applied to printed expression;<LI>India, which charges exorbitant rates for international access through the state-owned phone company;<LI>Germany, which has cut off access to particular host computers or Internet sites;<LI>Singapore, which has chosen to regulate the Internet as if it were a broadcast medium, and requires political and religious content providers to register with the state; and<LI>New Zealand, which classifies computer disks as publications and has seized and restricted them accordingly.</UL><P>Privacy issues are closely related to the regulation of content and access. On-line communications are particularly susceptible to unauthorized scrutiny. Encryption technology is needed to ensure that individuals and groups may communicate without fear of eavesdropping. Lack of information privacy will inhibit on-line speech and unnecessarily limit the diversity of voices on the GII.</P><P>The Internet has the potential to be a tremendous force for development by providing quick and inexpensive information, by encouraging discussion rather than violence, and by empowering citizens, to cite but a few examples. But this potential can be realized only if it becomes a truly global effort. Policy makers must make every effort to ensure that internationally guaranteed rights to free expression are extended to on-line communication and call for the repeal of censorship legislation. Without such commitments, individuals face the danger of seeing their rights eroded by the very technologies they are embracing. </P><P>This report recommends principles for international and regional bodies and nations to follow when formulating public policy and laws affecting the Internet, sets forth the international legal principles governing on-line expression, and, finally, examines some of the current attempts around the globe to censor on-line communication.</P></blockquote><IMG SRC="tealtxtm.gif"><P><A HREF="index.htm"><IMG SRC="tealprev.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="Previous Page"></A><A HREF="hrw2.htm"><IMG SRC="tealnext.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="Next Page"></A><A HREF="index.htm"><IMG SRC="tealinde.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="See File"></A></P></P></BODY></HTML>

<h2>Silencing the Net - Recommendations</h2>
<img width=650 height=1 src="../../newsflash_pix/news_line.jpg"></CENTER><br><br clear=all><BLOCKQUOTE><P>The meeting of the G7 countries (Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United States) in South Africa in May 1996 to discuss the development of the GII should be used as one platform to emphasize the importance of freedom of expression. <B>3</B> <font size=2>(A UNESCO meeting was held in Madrid in March 1996 to discuss copyright protection on the Internet. To our knowledge, that conference represented the only U.N.-sponsored effort to address Internet regulation.)</font> Regional agreements should clearly state that freedom of expression principles apply to electronic communication. These agreements should clarify that the Internet differs significantly from broadcast media in areas such as the level of choice and control afforded to the individual user. Because of such distinctions, it is important that the Internet not be subject to the same restrictions as are often imposed on broadcast media.</P><P>It is important to promote the universal application of two important free expression principles not yet codified in international law. The first of these is an explicit prohibition against prior censorship, that is, requiring official approval of communication before making it public. Such a practice has been used by repressive governments against the press and could be invoked against electronic communication. The second is an explicit prohibition against restrictions of free expression by indirect methods, such as the abuse of controls over equipment or broadcasting frequencies used in the dissemination of information; or by any other means tending to impede the communication and circulation of ideas and opinions. Controls over newsprint have frequently been used to silence critical publications. Governments are already modernizing their techniques to include modem lines and international Internet connections.</P><P>In its February 1995 letter to U.S. Vice President Al Gore on the eve of the G7 Ministerial Conference on the Information Society, Human Rights Watch joined with a number of other organizations in proposing the following principles regarding content, access, and privacy. <B>4</B> <font size=2>(The American Library Association, American Civil Liberties Union, Article 19, Center for Democracy and Technology, Electronic Frontiers Foundation, Electronic Privacy Information Center, People for the American Way, Privacy International also signed the letter.)</font> These principles are even more critical today, and we urge policy makers at the G7 conference in South Africa, and the framers of GII policy within other regional bodies and international organizations, to follow them.</P><H3>Content Issues</H3><P>Policy makers should take the initiative to expressly enshrine freedom of expression as a principle in the development of the GII. This should include:</P><UL><LI>Prohibiting prior censorship of on-line communication on the GII.<LI>Demanding that any restrictions of on-line speech content beclearly stated in the law and limited to direct and immediate incitement of acts of violence.<LI>Requiring that laws restricting the content of on-line speech distinguish between the liability of content providers and the liability of data carriers.<LI>Insisting that on-line free expression not be restricted by indirect means such as excessively restrictive governmental or private controls over computer hardware or software, telecommunications infrastructure, or other essential components of the GII.<LI>Calling for the promotion of non-commercial public discourse on the GII.<LI>Promoting the wide dissemination of diverse ideas and viewpoints from a wide variety of information sources on the GII.<LI>Ensuring that the GII enable individuals to organize and form on-line associations freely and without interference.</UL><H3>Access Issues</H3><P>GII policy should emphasize the importance of providing Internet access to everyone, regardless of geographic or other factors. This should encompass:</P><UL><LI>Including citizens in the GII development process from countries that are currently unstable economically, have insufficient infrastructure, or lack sophisticated technology.<LI>Providing non-discriminatory access to on-line technology.<LI>Guaranteeing a full range of viewpoints, by providing access to a diversity of information providers, including non-commercial educational, artistic, and other public interest service providers.<LI>Providing two-way communication and enabling individuals to publish their own information and ideas.<LI>Protecting diversity of access by establishing technical standards that can be applied easily in a variety of systems.<LI>Prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.</UL><H3>Privacy Issues</H3><P>Delegates to the G7 meeting and other meetings concerning policy on the GII should guarantee respect for the privacy of communication on the Internet by:</P><UL><LI>Ensuring that personal information generated on the GII for one purpose is not used for an unrelated purpose or disclosed without the person's informed consent.<LI>Enabling individuals to review personal information on the GII and to correct inaccurate information.<LI>Providing privacy measures for information regarding on-line business transactions as well as content.<LI>Allowing users of the GII to encrypt their communications and information without restriction.</UL><P>The above recommendations are also pertinent to individual governments in shaping their own policies with respect to on-line communication. In addition, the following recommendations apply to domestic Internet policies:</P><UL><LI>To ensure that domestic Internet services are designed to ensure universal access, governments should provide full disclosure of information infrastructure development plans and encourage democratic participation in all aspects of the development process. They should also advocate widespread use of the GII and strive to provide adequate training. In addition, governments should urge citizens to take an active role in public affairs by providing access to government information.<LI>In order to guarantee the privacy of on-line communication, governments should put in place enforceable legal protections against unauthorized scrutiny and use by private or public entities of personal information on the GII. They should also oppose controls on the export and import of communications technologies, including encryption. In addition, governments should conduct investigations on the GII pursuant only to lawful authority and subject to judicial review.</UL></blockquote><IMG SRC="tealtxtm.gif"><P><A HREF="hrw1.htm"><IMG SRC="tealprev.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="Previous Page"></A><A HREF="hrw3.htm"><IMG SRC="tealnext.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="Next Page"></A><A HREF="index.htm"><IMG SRC="tealinde.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="See File"></A></P></BODY></HTML>

<h2>Silencing the Net - Background</h2>
<img width=650 height=1 src="../../newsflash_pix/news_line.jpg"></CENTER><br><br clear=all><BLOCKQUOTE><P>The Internet began in the 1960s as a way of linking a U.S. Defense Department network and other communications networks. Over time, many other networks and users from around the world have connected themselves to the Internet. The U.S. still dominates the Internet in terms of users and content, but Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand are also on-line in large numbers. Internet usage in much of Asia is increasing rapidly as well. The number of Internet users is believed to range between twenty and thirty million. More than 160 countries are reported to have links to the Internet, over one hundred nations with full access and the rest through e-mail. <B>5</B> <font size=2>(Johanna Son, &quot;Asia-Communication: Bumps Lie Ahead in Information Superhighway,&quot; Inter Press Service, December 14, 1995.)</font> </P><P>The Internet is composed of a number of different ways of organizing, transmitting and accessing data. Because of this multiplicity of systems, it is unlike any other single medium. Rather, it incorporates characteristics of several other media and communications systems, including print, broadcast, and postal systems. Electronic mail (e-mail) allows for one-to-one or one-to-many communication. Gopher sites provide text-only information arranged according to menus. The World Wide Web allows for the display of many types of information, including text, images, sound and video, as well as interactive communication.</P><P>A recognition by world leaders of the need to formulate policy for this powerful new medium prompted members of the G7 to hold a &quot;Ministerial Conference on the Information Society&quot; in Brussels in February 1995. At that conference, a number of principles were agreed to, including encouraging competition and private investment, defining an adaptable regulatory framework, providing open access to networks, ensuring universal access, and promoting equality of opportunity and diversity of content. Although freedom of expression was not highlighted in specific terms, to the disappointment of Human Rights Watch and other groups that had urged such an emphasis, it is implied in the final goal promoting diversity of content which can be achieved only by encouraging free expression for people all over the world. <B>6</B> <font size=2>(Letter to Vice President Gore from Human Rights Watch, Electronic Privacy Information Center, ACLU, American Library Association, Article 19, Center for Democracy and Technology, Electronic Frontiers Foundation, People for the American Way, and Privacy International, February 16, 1995.)</font> In his keynote address to the conference, Vice President Gore, an active proponent of the GII, stated, &quot;[Global communication] is about protecting and enlarging freedom of expression for all our citizens and giving individual citizens the power to create the information they need and want from the abundant flow of data they encounter moment to moment.&quot;</P><P>One of the main targets of the censors is Usenet, a system separate from the Internet but accessible from it, that &quot;pump[s] upwards of 100 million characters a day into the system - nearly an encyclopedia's worth of writing.&quot; <B>7</B> <font size=2>(Adam Gaffin, EFF Guide to the Internet (San Francisco: Electronic Frontiers Foundation,Revised December 4, 1995).)</font> Usenet comprises more than 9,000 &quot;newsgroups&quot; discussions or picture databases on various topics, including the political and the sexually explicit. The groups are arranged under headings such as biz (business), comp (computers and related subjects), rec (hobbies, games and recreation), sci (science), soc (&quot;social&quot; groups, often ethnically related), talk (politics and related topics), and alt (for alternative, often controversial). Not all the newsgroups are available on all Internet host computers. Usenet came to prominent international attention most recently in late December 1995, when CompuServe, an on-line service of H&amp;R Block, based in Columbus, Ohio, removed from all of its computers more than 200 Usenet computer discussion groups and picture databases that had provoked criticism by a federal prosecutor in Munich. <B>8</B> <font size=2>(The &quot;banned&quot; newsgroups were still available to CompuServe users who used the service to connect to computers that carried the newsgroups. Information on how to do this circulated quickly through the CompuServe system.)</font> Three days later, the Chinese government echoed the Germans' actions by calling for a crackdown on the Internet to rid the country of pornography and &quot;detrimental information.&quot; <B>9</B> <font size=2>(&quot;China Cracks Down on Internet,&quot; Deutche Presse Agentur, January 1, 1996.)</font></P><P>It should not be surprising that governments around the globe are anxious to control this new medium. Every communications advance in history has been seen by self-appointed moral guardians as something to be controlled and regulated. By 1558, a century after the invention of the printing press, a Papal index barred the works of more than 500 authors. In 1915, the same year that the D. W. Griffith film &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot; changed the U.S. cultural landscape, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of an Ohio state censorship board created two years earlier, thus exempting motion pictures from free speech protection on the grounds that their exhibition &quot;is a business, pure and simple, originated and conducted for profit....&quot; The same view was applied in the early days of radio entertainment programs were thought to be exempt from freedom of speech guarantees.</P><P>The Internet, as the first truly &quot;mass&quot; medium, is even more threatening than these earlier media. While few individuals and groups can publish books or newspapers, make a film, or produce a radio or television program, any person with a personal computer and a modem can communicate with a huge international audience. The implications of a real GII for the advancement of human rights and democracy are vast. When traditional means of communication broke down and the war in Sarajevo made it impossible for civilians to leave their homes without risking their lives, many citizens used on-line technology to communicate with family members, the international press, and humanitarian relief agencies. Human rights groups, political organizations, and builders of burgeoning democracies are using the Internet to communicate, educate, and organize. During the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995, women all over the world were able to feel a sense of participation because of regular postings on the proceedings. It is precisely because of the Internet's potential for increasing the political participation of the disenfranchised that governments are seekingto control it.</P><P>These initial achievements could easily disappear if the censors are allowed to have their way. Governments and other institutions that support freedom of expression must ensure that the Internet is granted the same guarantees that are given to other forms of individual expression. International law is clear on what electronic rights of expression must entail. Although international law does not address such communication specifically, the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights enshrine rights to freedom of expression, access, and privacy, which are relevant to the new medium. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. <B>10</B> <font size=2>(Other relevant articles from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights include the following: &quot;Article 7: All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law; Article 12: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence; Article 27: Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.)</font></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) guarantees this right as well, and notes that restrictions on this right &quot;shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;(b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals.&quot; <B>11</B> <font size=2>(Other relevant articles from the ICCPR include the following: Article 25 guarantees the right &quot;to take part in the conduct of public affairs;&quot; Article 26 states: &quot;All persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law....[T]he law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.&quot;)</font></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The recently adopted Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information <B>12</B> <font size=2>(These Principles were adopted on October 1, 1995 by a group of experts in international law, national security, and human rights.)</font> state that restrictions on freedom of expression are permitted only when &quot;the government can demonstrate that the restriction is prescribed by law and is necessary in a democratic society to protect a legitimate national security interest.&quot; <B>13</B> <font size=2>(For the purposes of the Principles, &quot;a democratic society is one which has a government that is genuinely accountable to an entity or organ distinct from itself; there must be genuine, periodicelections by universal and equal suffrage held by secret ballot that guarantee the free expression of the will of the electors; political groups must be free to organize in opposition to the government in office; and there must be effective legal guarantees of fundamental rights enforced by an independent judiciary.&quot;)</font> According to the Principles, the burden of demonstrating the validity of the restriction rests with the government. <B>14</B> <font size=2>(Principle 1(c).)</font> Criticism of the government or its leaders is protected. <B>15</B> <font size=2>(Principle 7.)</font> In addition, a government must demonstrate that &quot;the restriction imposed is the least restrictive means possible for protecting that interest.&quot; <B>16</B> <font size=2>(Principle 1.3(b).)</font></P></blockquote><IMG SRC="tealtxtm.gif"><P><A HREF="hrw2.htm"><IMG SRC="tealprev.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="Previous Page"></A><A HREF="hrw4.htm"><IMG SRC="tealnext.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="Next Page"></A><A HREF="index.htm"><IMG SRC="tealinde.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="See File"></A></P></BODY></HTML>

<img width=650 height=1 src="../../newsflash_pix/news_line.jpg"></CENTER><br><br clear=all><BLOCKQUOTE><p><p><H3>United States</H3><P>Hysteria about &quot;cyberporn&quot; was ignited in the U.S. after Time magazine published a cover story, complete with lurid photographs, asserting the wide availability of sexually explicit material on the Internet. <B>17</B> <font size=2>(Philip Elmer-Dewitt, &quot;On a Screen Near You: It's Popular, Pervasive and Surprisingly Perverse, According to the First Survey of On-line Erotica. And There's No Easy Way To Stamp It Out,&quot; Time, July 3, 1995.)</font> The article was based on the research findings (later acknowledged by Time to have been seriously flawed) of a student at Carnegie Mellon University. Nevertheless, this concern recently culminated in the enactment of the Communications Decency Act (CDA), an amendment to a sweeping telecommunications reform bill signed in February 1996.</P><P>The CDA criminalizes on-line communication that is &quot;obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass an other person&quot; or &quot;obscene or indecent&quot; if the recipient of the communication is under eighteen years of age &quot;regardless of whether the maker of such communication placed the call or initiated the communication.&quot; Also prohibited is on-line communication to minors that &quot;depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs, regardless of whether the user of such service placed the call or initiated the communication.&quot; <B>18</B> <font size=2>(U.S. Code, Title V, Subsection A, Section 502 &quot;Obscene or Harassing Use of Telecommunications Facilities Under the Communications Act of 1934.&quot; )</font> The CDA would permit the U.S., for example, to seek the arrest of a European content provider whose sexually explicit material was seen as &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently offensive.&quot; </P><P>In letters to members of Congress and President Clinton, Human Rights Watch opposed the CDA, taking the position that &quot;indecent&quot; speech is protected by both the U.S. Constitution and international law. Human Rights Watch is also concerned that the effort to censor &quot;indecent&quot; communication could impede the work of our own and similar organizations which transmit graphic accounts of human rights abuses. Because of these concerns, in February, Human Rights Watch became a plaintiff in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union challenging the CDA on constitutional grounds. The suit is currently before a panel of judges. According to our affidavit, </P><BLOCKQUOTE>Some of the accounts [of abuses in Human Rights Watch reports] are necessarily graphic and explicit: torture, rape, mutilation, execution, mass murder are brutalities that must be discussed in detail if people are to understand the widespread human rights abuses occurring worldwide. Likewise, to address human rights abuses without discussing the violence of acts such as rape, torture, and bodily mutilation would be impossible. Human Rights Watch exposes the abuse in order to educate the public about the scope of current abuse and to prevent future atrocities.</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>[T]he graphic nature of some of the eyewitness accounts,especially those dealing with sexual assault, may be considered &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently offensive&quot; under this statute. For example, our July 1995 press release on slavery in Pakistan, posted at our gopher site [on the Internet], provides graphic and factual details on the ways in which bonded laborers have been tortured. The text relates that they have been &quot;beaten with sticks, stripped naked, hung upside down, burned with cigarettes, beaten on the genitals and have had their legs pulled apart. Women prisoners are often held in custody indefinitely and suffer a consistent pattern of sexual assault, including rape.&quot; A March 1995 press release on abuses by Nigerian security forces in Ogoniland, posted at our gopher site, quotes the testimony of one woman, as follows: &quot;K, a woman in her late thirties from the village of Bera, told Human Rights Watch that she had been raped by five soldiers in rapid succession on the morning of May 28, 1994. After locking K's 10-year-old son in a room, K recalled,</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><b>..the soldiers beat me with the butts of their guns, pushed me onto the ground, and kicked me. They tore off my wrapper, then my underwear. Two of them raped me through my anus, three the usual way. While one soldier raped me, another would beat me. I tried to scream, but they held my mouth. They said if I made too much noise they would kill me.</b></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>Our October 1993 report on the abuse of Burmese refugees from Arakan, posted on the newsgroup reg.seasia, relates abuses against women in language such as, &quot;then the official grabbed her breast&quot; (p. 12); &quot;the CIC and the other official put their hands inside S.K.'s clothing and touched her all over her body, including her vagina&quot; (p. 13); &quot;...one policeman fondled S.K.'s breasts and struck S.K. on the back of then neck with a stick&quot; (p. 13).</BLOCKQUOTE><P>Clearly, obstacles to Human Rights Watch in reporting these atrocities in the United States are likely to be magnified for groups operating in more repressive states and attempting to post similar findings on the Internet.</P><H3>Canada</H3><P>In response to the debate about cyberspace, the Canadian government formed the Information Highway Advisory Council (IHAC) in 1994 to study and prepare an official statement on what directions the Internet should take in Canada. In September 1995, the council released its first report, which contained only vague recommendations. On the issue of content, it concluded that there should be controls on two primary targets: obscenity and racist/hate material. <B>19</B> <font size=2>(Alana Kainz, &quot;Information Highway: Advisory report leaves uncharted roads,&quot; Ottawa Citizen, September 28, 1995.)</font><p>It is illegal to spread &quot;hate propaganda&quot; and &quot;obscenity&quot; in Canada. Sexually explicit material is legal as long as it is not deemed obscene, that is, characterized by &quot;undue exploitation of sex,&quot; meaning sex plus violence or degrading sex. Under a new law on child pornography that has not been tested by the Supreme Court, mere possession is illegal. According to David Jones, president of Electronic Frontiers Canada, &quot;There are no new laws being proposed that apply specifically to the Internet.&quot; <B>20</B> <font size=2>(E-mail correspondence from Dr.David Jones to Human Rights Watch, February 15, 1996.)</font> <p>That could change, however. On April 2, 1996, Justice Minister Allan Rock released a discussion paper inviting Canadians to present their views on regulating excessive violence in the media, including the Internet. <B>21</B> <font size=2>(David Vienneau, &quot;Rock seeks views on violence,&quot; Toronto Star, April 3, 1996.)</font><p></blockquote><IMG SRC="tealtxtm.gif"><P><A HREF="hrw3.htm"><IMG SRC="tealprev.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="Previous Page"></A><A HREF="hrw5.htm"><IMG SRC="tealnext.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="Next Page"></A><A HREF="index.htm"><IMG SRC="tealinde.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="See File"></A></P></BODY></HTML>

A senior scientist at Pakistan's state-owned National Institute of Electronics has noted that Internet access would be limited by the small number of nodes and hosts available to users and by the intervention of service providers who could stop undesirable discussion groups and electronic messages. <B>24</B> <font size=2>(Ajoy Sen, &quot;Some Asian Nations Give Internet Mixed Reception,&quot; Reuters, June 13, 1995.)</font> In India, where commercial Internet access was launched in mid-1995, only the state-owned phone company, VSNL, has been allowed to provide international Internet services, in order to maintain the government's monopoly on long-distance phone services. <B>25</B> <font size=2>(Spaeth, Anthony, &quot; National Security,' the Vietnamese Government Wants to Control Internet Access,&quot; Time, October 16, 1995.)</font> According to guidelines issued by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) based on the antiquated Indian Telegraph Act of 1885, an ISP must ensure that nothing objectionable or obscene is carried on the network, but it is not clear that these have been enforced. In late January 1996, the DoT decided to allow commercial access, but all companies will have to route their services through VSNL. <B>26</B> <font size=2>(C. T.

Users have access to information generated outside China, but only after it has been screened in Hong Kong.

Singapore allows three service providers: Singnet, which is part of Singapore Telecom, Pacific Internet and Cyberway. The government claims that it does not currently censor e-mail, but in 1994 it disclosed that it had searched individual accounts to try to identify those who had downloaded sexually explicit material. After businesses expressed alarmed about the security of their information, authorities said they would refrain from conducting such searches in the future.</P><P>The main means of censorship up to now has been to control access. In addition, sexually explicit material and news have been censored by the Ministry of Information and the Arts, the government body in charge of media censorship. Fewer than half of Usenet newsgroups are available through Singnet. Currently there are no widespread uniform guidelines or procedures for restricting use of any Internet services, and local administrators have to make arbitrary decision on access.</P><P>The minister of information and the arts told Parliament that &quot;Censorship can no longer be 100 percent effective, but even if it is only 20 percent effective, we should still not stop censoring....We cannot screen every bit of information that comes down the information highway, but we can make it illegal and costly for mass distributors of objectionable material to operate in Singapore.&quot; <B>45</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Singapore defends censorship in Internet age,&quot; Reuters, July 7, 1995.)</font> Colonel Ho Meng Kit, the CEO of the SBA, the committee that oversees content on the Internet, said objectionable material could be censored through three main channels: technology, legislation, and licensing. He stated that only ISPs would be targeted and noted, &quot;[Censorship] may not always be effective but it makes a statement about the nature of Singapore society and the values it wants to uphold.&quot; <B>46</B> <font size=2>(Jimmy Yap, &quot;Singapore Takes Aim at Cybersmut,&quot; Straits Times (Singapore), July 30, 1995.)</font></P><P>Although authorities initially stated that they would not heavily censor political criticism, they have reportedly shifted from watching for sex-related material to watching for &quot;misinformation.&quot; Some topics recently discussed on the newsgroup soc.culture.singapore ranging from Michael Fay's caning to the case of a Filipino maid convicted of double murder sparked the formation of a government administrative committee, which has started Singapore Infomap, a Web site, to provide &quot;correct&quot; information and rebut &quot;inaccurate&quot; information.</P><P>In early March, the government announced more severe censorship measures, including the licensing of all ISPs and a requirement to use filtering software. The measures are meant to prevent Singaporeans from accessing sexually explicit material and hate literature, and will also cover politics and religion. The government also announced that World Wide Web content providers would have to register with the SBA, and that three categories of Web pages would be scrutinized: those operated by political parties, electronic newspapers targeting Singapore, and pages concerned with politics or religion. <B>47</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Singapore GovernmentClamps Down on Internet and Supports Its Future,&quot; Telenews Asia (Rozelle, Australia), March 21, 1996.)</font> In April, the regulations tightened further. The SBA announced that it was setting guidelines, to become effective in June 1996, for Internet content providers. According to the preliminary guidelines, those with Web sites must ensure they do not encourage abuse or distribute objectionable information, such as sexually explicit material. Sponsors of discussion groups may have to register with the SBA. Internet content providers and ISPs will be responsible for what is transmitted. The rules also require Internet service providers to institute an acceptable use policy. <B>48</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Singapore Sets Rules for Internet Providers, TV Singapore,&quot; Reuters, April 14, 1996.)</font></P><H3>Indonesia</H3><P>Indonesia's first commercial provider, Indonet, began operation in late 1994. A number of others soon followed, and the country now has numerous ISPs. The more established electronic bulletin board networks also draw extensively from the Internet. The Internet is more free than any other mass medium in Indonesia, and there are no laws, regulations or ministerial decrees concerning its use. Tempo, a news weekly that was closed by the government two years ago, recently established a site on the Web, with the blessing of the minister of information who agreed &quot;there are no regulations against it,&quot; but warned that &quot;maybe the House [of Representatives] will want to discuss legislating the Internet.&quot; <B>49</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Tempo on Internet is okay: Harmoko,&quot; Jakarta Post, March 13, 1996, as reported on the Indonesia- L mailing list, March 13, 1996.)</font> At this stage, however, the government has chosen to compete with opposing views by establishing its own Web sites. </P><P>Armed Forces spokesman Brig.-Gen. Surwarno Adiwijoyo told Reuters news agency that the military had suggested to the Communications Ministry the need for some sort of &quot;toll gate&quot; to &quot;black out&quot; news that could damage culture or affect security. <B>50</B> <font size=2>(Jim Della-Giacoma, &quot;Politics, Not Sex, Indonesian Internet Concern,&quot; Reuters, November 16, 1995)</font> It has also suggested registering uses and users, he said. At present, private ISPs do not carry all Usenet groups, but this is reportedly done in the interests of conserving disk space and because of the language barrier. <B>51</B> <font size=2>(E-mail from John MacDougall, April 9, 1996.)</font></P><H3>Malaysia</H3><P>The Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic Systems (Mimos), the nation's sole Internet provider, has experienced a huge demand, with an average monthly increase of 22 percent since it began service in late 1994. As of October 1995, there were some 30,000 users. In April 1996, Mimos announced that it would appoint eight new ISPs to help ease congestion.</P><P>Usenet newsgroups are heavily censored. The &quot;acceptable use&quot; policy at Jaring, the main Malaysian Internet line, states that &quot;members shall not use Jaring network for any activities not allowed under any Law of Malaysia.&quot; <B>52</B> <font size=2>(Charles A. Gimon, &quot;Internet Censorship Around the World,&quot; Info Nation (Minneapolis,MN), July 1995.)</font> The government reportedly realizes that on-line censorship may not be effective. Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad has warned Malaysians that &quot;It depends on the culture. If the culture is weak, we will be the victims. But if we use it in a way that can increase our knowledge, we will get many benefits from the Internet.&quot; <B>53</B> <font size=2>(Lokman Mansor, &quot;Dr. M, Ramos Have a Chat Via the Internet,&quot; Business Times (Kuala Lumpur), January 18, 1996.)</font> However, in March 1996, Information Minister Datuk Mohamed Rahmat announced that a new regulatory body would be set up to monitor the Internet and that those criticizing the government &quot;will face the music.&quot; <B>54</B> <font size=2>(Ian Stewart, &quot;Internet Curbs in the Pipelines,&quot; South China Morning Post, March 13, 1996. )</font></P><P>In reaction to Malaysian students abroad criticizing Malaysia on the Internet, the government has considered various ways to curb such dissent, according to the information and education ministers, and the education minister proposed cutting scholarships of offending students.</P><H3>South Korea</H3><P>In South Korea, about half of all Internet users are affiliated with universities or the government. The nationally run telephone corporation, Korea Telecom, started service in June 1994, and there are a number of other commercial providers.</P><P>The government has decided to censor computer networks, according to statements by communications officials in October 1995. The decision was reportedly made out of growing concern regarding children's access to sexually explicit and other undesirable material. Local computer networks will be asked to prohibit access by local subscribers to banned sites, according to the Information and Communications Ethics Committee of the Data and Communications Ministry. Sexually explicit material will be banned, along with information deemed &quot;subversive,&quot; such as instructions on making bombs and drugs. Computer games and other software are already censored. Details, such as punishments, have reportedly yet to be worked out. <B>55</B> <font size=2>(&quot;South Korea to Censor Computer Communications Networks,&quot; AP Worldstream, October 20, 1995.)</font></P><H3>Vietnam</H3><P>The state-owned telecommunications company Vietnam Datacommunications Company (VDC) had planned to launch Internet service earlier this year, but it reportedly put off the opening day because officials decided to first draft regulations on allowable Internet links and users. Internet regulations will reportedly comply with the government's existing censorship regulations. Pham Dao, director of VDC, said that an Internet firewall would be installed to screen out transmissions from specified senders or news resources cutting out much of the anti-government commentary carried by dissident groups, including support for jailed Buddhists and dissidents. <B>56</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Vietnamese Net Provider to Censor Inbound Transmissions,&quot; Telecomworldwire, January 11, 1996, and Jon Auerbach, &quot;Fences in cyberspace; Governments move to limit free flow of the Internet, The Boston Globe, February 1, 1996. )</font> It appears likely that the Ministry ofCulture and Information will monitor on-line content and that Interior Ministry will be in charge of monitoring Internet national security issues. <B>57</B> <font size=2>(Peter Mears, Radio Australia, March 24, 1996, as reported in &quot;Help Sought from Singapore in Policing the Internet,&quot; BBC, March 26, 1996, and &quot;Government to use foreign software to police Internet users,&quot; Agence France Presse, March 24, 1996.)</font> Nguyen Ngoc Canh of the General Directorate of Posts and Telecommunications, which sets communication policy, said competing domestic services likely will be allowed as long as Vietnam Datacommunications Company monitors a single outside link. <B>58</B> <font size=2>(Kathy Wilhelm,&quot;Vietnam Net or Not,&quot; AP, January 4, 1996.)</font></P><P>Until recently, Vietnam's Internet service was made available through the Institute of Information Technology, which exists mostly for the benefit of academics and nongovernmental organizations.

<h2>Silencing the Net - Australia and New Zealand</h2>
<img width=650 height=1 src="../../newsflash_pix/news_line.jpg"></CENTER><br><br clear=all><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Australia has been considering regulating the Internet since 1993. In August 1994, the Department of Communications and the Arts released a report, &quot;Regulation of Computer Bulletin Board Systems,&quot; which called for regulations. A year later, the recommendations in that report were updated and released in the &quot;Consultation Paper on the Regulation of On-line Information Services.&quot; One of the goals elucidated in the consultation paper was &quot;to protect freedom of expression, especially with regard to private communication between adults, while at the same time limiting children's exposure to harmful or unsuitable material.&quot; It proposed a system of self-regulation reinforced by legislative sanctions. Objectionable material was defined in the consultation paper as material that &quot;depicts, expresses, or otherwise deals with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that it offends against the standards of morality, decency and proprietary generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that the material should be refused classification.&quot; Restricted material was defined as &quot;material that [is] unsuitable for seeing, reading or playing by persons under 15.&quot; <B>61</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Consultation Paper on the Regulation of On-line Information Services,&quot; Australian Department of Communications and the Arts, July 7, 1996 (URL: <A HREF="http://www.dca.gov.au/pubs/paper_2.html">http://www.dca.gov.au/pubs/paper_2.html</A>))</font></P><P>In August 1995, the minister for communications and the arts directed the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA), an independent federal authority responsible for the regulation of the broadcasting industry, to investigate the content of on-line information and entertainment services and report to him by June 30, 1996. The resulting ABA &quot;issues paper&quot; became available in December 1995, with an invitation for comments to be submitted by the public until mid-February. The paper discusses various issues involved in the development of a code of practice, the adoption of a classification scheme, enforcement of a code, and blocking offensive sites.</P><P>Electronic Frontiers Australia, a nongovernmental organization working for rights of Internet users in Australia, submitted a response to the issues paper, arguing a number of points, including that the Internet, because of its interactivity, significantly differs from broadcast media. &quot;[C]lassification of content is unnecessary and in most instances impossible to police,&quot; it pointed out. The EFA also urged the government to consult with the industry and &quot;develop a grasp of the realities of the on-line service industry.&quot; <B>62</B> <font size=2>(Kimberly Heitman, &quot;ABA Inquiry Submission,&quot; Electronic Frontiers Australia, February 16, 1996.)</font></P><P>Some state governments, including those of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia, Northern Territory, and Tasmania, have already passed or are planning to introduce on-line censorship legislation. <B>63</B> <font size=2>(Michael Sharp, &quot;Internet Porn Pedlars Face Jail,&quot; Sydney Morning Herald, April 3, 1996, and John Davidson, &quot;New Moves on Internet Porn Laws,&quot; Australian Financial Review (Sydney), April 3, 1996.)</font> In early October 1995,eighteen people were being questioned and fifteen computers seized across the state of Queensland for alleged involvement with child pornography, based on the state's Classification of Computer Games and Images Act (1995). In Victoria state, the Classification (Publications, Films &amp; Computer Games Enforcement) Bill, which has passed two houses of Parliament and awaits enactment, makes it an offense to use an on-line network to transmit &quot;objectionable&quot; material to minors. <B>64</B> <font size=2>(Mike van Niekerk, &quot;Censor Moves to Shackle Net,&quot; The Age (Melbourne), February 13, 1996.)</font> Victoria's bill has passed two houses of Parliament. A similar law in Western Australia went into effect on January 1, 1996. Both leave primary censorship in the hands of service providers, and seek to punish senders of information deemed &quot;objectionable&quot; and senders of information classified as &quot;restricted&quot; to minors according to broad definitions contained in the legislation. <B>65</B> <font size=2>(For example, the Western Australia bill defines &quot;restricted material&quot; to be that which a reasonable adult, by reason of the nature of the article, or the nature or extent of references in the article, to matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena, would regard as unsuitable for a minor to see, read or hear.&quot;)</font> ISPs are liable only if they knowingly permit objectionable material to be transmitted on their network. An even more extreme bill now before the parliament in New South Wales will hold individuals and ISPs responsible for objectionable material, which includes not only sexually explicit information but also drug- and crime-related material. All state laws are subject to change when new federal laws are adopted.</P><H3>New Zealand</H3><P>Restrictive Internet legislation was proposed in Parliament in 1994, but, according to Stephen Bell, an Internet activist in New Zealand, it &quot;is widely perceived as more or less dead&quot; at present because of unrelated political developments. <B>66</B> <font size=2>(E-mail from Stephen Bell to Human Rights Watch, February 1996.)</font> Under the legislation, the New Zealand Technology and Crimes Reform Bill, all users would be cut off from any site that transmitted a single piece of objectionable material to a single user. Those found in violation of the law could be fined thousands and lose the use of a telephone for up to five years.</P><P>Under current law, computer disks are treated as &quot;publications,&quot; and may be censored as such under the Films, Videos and Publications Classification Act of 1993. If authorities find one example of the more serious grade of &quot;objectionable&quot; material, as defined by the Act, <B>67</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Objectionable&quot; is defined to include that which &quot;describes, depicts, expresses, or otherwise deals with matters such as sex, horror, crime, cruelty, or violence in such a manner that the availability of the publication is likely to be injurious to the public good.&quot;)</font> they may arrest and shut down an ISP. <B>68</B> <font size=2>(E-mail to Human Rights Watch from Stephen Bell of New Zealand, February 7, 1996.)</font></P><P>Apparently fearing possible liability, several universities and Internet providers have been blocking access to newsgroups dealing with erotica. <B>69</B> <font size=2>(Internet Australasia, August 1995 (URL:<A HREF="http://www.interaus.net">http://www.interaus.net</A>).)</font></P></blockquote><IMG SRC="tealtxtm.gif"><P><A HREF="hrw5.htm"><IMG SRC="tealprev.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="Previous Page"></A><A HREF="hrw7.htm"><IMG SRC="tealnext.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="Next Page"></A><A HREF="index.htm"><IMG SRC="tealinde.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="See File"></A></P></BODY></HTML>

<h2>Silencing the Net - Middle East</h2>
<img width=650 height=1 src="../../newsflash_pix/news_line.jpg"></CENTER><br><br clear=all><BLOCKQUOTE><P>The Middle East is coming on-line in increasing numbers, but many governments are hoping to control access to sensitive political and religious discussion as well as sex-related material. Bahrain went on-line in December 1995 through Batelco, the government-run phone company, after installing an expensive system to block access to certain Internet-related sites. <B>70</B> <font size=2>(Richard Moore, &quot;Huge Demand for Internet Link,&quot; Egyptian Gazette (Cairo), January 11, 1996.)</font> GlobeNet, a U.S. firm, won a contract to provide Internet service in Jordan in 1995 and was asked by authorities to install a special screening facility to control sexually explicit material. <B>71</B> <font size=2>(London Observer Service, &quot;Many Arab nations seek Internet curbs,&quot; Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, January 8, 1995.)</font> Kuwait is planning to launch a new Internet service soon, but a Communications Ministry official told the press that the new ISP &quot;must ensure that no pornography or politically subversive' commentary is available in Kuwait.&quot; There is no new content-related legislation planned at present. <B>72</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Kuwait to boost Internet service but plans censorship,&quot; Agence France Presse, April 11, 1996.)</font> In Abu Dhabi, an Internet club &quot;ha[s] agreed to ban sex, religion and politics on the Internet to respect the local laws.&quot; <B>73</B> <font size=2>(Michael Georgy, &quot;Internet Fever Sweeps Gulf,&quot; Reuters, April 4, 1996.)</font> Police in the United Arab Emirates recently held a seminar on combatting political dissent and sexually explicit material. <B>74</B> <font size=2>(Ibid.)</font></P><P>In Morocco, the state Office National des Postes et Telecommunications (ONPT) brought the Internet to the nation on November 16, 1995. ONPT has secured an agreement with the commercial companies that will provide the service. Charges will be fixed, and a convention has been signed to govern all aspects of the Internet's operation. The service has been targeted at the banking and insurance sectors, universities, and multinational corporations. <B>75</B> <font size=2>(John Cooper, &quot;The Middle East Gets Caught in the Internet,&quot; Middle East Economic Digest (London), December 4, 1995.)</font></P><H3>Iran</H3><P>The first Iranian Internet line was opened in 1992 by the Institute for Studies in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics through a link to Vienna. <B>76</B> <font size=2>(Stuart Wavell, &quot;Closed Societies Opened by Internet Genie,&quot; Sunday Times (London), September 3, 1995.)</font> The government helped with funds. Internet users, still mostly at universities, now number around 30,000. <B>77</B> <font size=2>(Ibid.)</font> </P><P>The government also sponsors a network whose chat rooms allow on-line dialogue between only two subscribers at a time, and private ISPs also exist. Access to the Internet is relatively unregulated, but its increasing popularity will likely result in greater government control. One private network had its lines cut by the Telecommunications Company (TCI) of Iran in August 1995. TCI may have been reacting to reports that the network was being used by young people for sex chats, or it may have been trying to reduce competition to its own network service. <B>78</B> <font size=2>(Cooper, &quot;The Middle East Gets Caught in the Internet,&quot; Middle East EconomicDigest.)</font></P><H3>Saudi Arabia</H3><P>In Saudi Arabia, Internet access has been confined to universities and hospitals. All local accounts, which automatically note the material accessed, are open to inspection by the Ministry of the Interior. Government officials have justified their reluctance to permit large-scale access on the grounds that there is a need to protect people from pornographic and other harmful effects. Existing pornography laws apply to the Internet, but loopholes are available: large foreign companies are increasingly offering their unmonitored Internet access to Saudi business acquaintances, and commercial members of the GulfNet are also free from scrutiny. </P><P>Internet access will reportedly be made available to businesses in 1996, but reportedly with strict controls. Mohammed Benten, a dean at King Fahd University for Petroleum and Minerals in Dhahran, told a local newspaper, &quot;Here in the kingdom, with our strict rules and regulations, we will see the Internet being accessed only for constructive objectives.&quot; <B>79</B> <font size=2>(Faiza S. Ambah, &quot;Dissidents Tap the Net to Nettle Arab Sheikdom,&quot; Christian Science Monitor, August 24, 1995.)</font> Minister of Posts, Telephones and Telegraphs Dr. Ali Al-Johani said in February 1996 that, although the Internet was beyond government control, authorities were investigating how it could be regulated. <B>80</B> <font size=2>(Saleh Al-Dehaim, &quot;Panel Formed to Study Telecom Privatization,&quot; Arab News, January 31, 1996, as reported in Moneyclips, February 21, 1996.)</font></P></blockquote><IMG SRC="tealtxtm.gif"><P><A HREF="hrw6.htm"><IMG SRC="tealprev.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="Previous Page"></A><A HREF="hrw8.htm"><IMG SRC="tealnext.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="Next Page"></A><A HREF="index.htm"><IMG SRC="tealinde.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="See File"></A></P></BODY></HTML>

<h2>Silencing the Net - Europe</h2>
<img width=650 height=1 src="../../newsflash_pix/news_line.jpg"></CENTER><br><br clear=all><BLOCKQUOTE><P>The European Union is considering adopting some Internet-related controls. In late January 1996, a European Union Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia said it &quot;hope[d] the EU [would] take all needed measures to prevent Internet from becoming a vehicle for the incitement of racist hatred.&quot; It also called for the &quot;creation of protective judicial measures.&quot; <B>81</B> <font size=2>(&quot;EU Group Calls for Curb on Racism on Internet,&quot; Reuters, January 29, 1996.)</font> It urged all member states to follow the example of Germany, which has been trying to censor racist and pornographic messages. France joined the call for regulation in early February, when the French minister for information technology announced that France would request members of the EU to draft new legislation to cope with legal issues posed by the Internet. It is believed that France's reaction has to do with the recent posting on the Internet of the banned book, Le Grand Secret, by Claude Gubler, the late President Mitterand's physician. <B>82</B> <font size=2>(Sylbia Dennis, &quot;Banned Mitterand Book on the Net Ignites French Government,&quot; Newsbytes News Network, February 5, 1996, and &quot;French plan to stifle Internet freedom,&quot; New Media Age, February 8, 1996.)</font></P><P>EU culture and telecommunications ministers met informally in Bologna, Italy in late April 1996, to discuss Internet regulation. At the meeting, France proposed the drafting of a global convention on Internet regulation. The ministers agreed to ask the European Commission, the executive body of the EU, to draw up a report on the question. The Commission is reportedly supposed to determine whether the EU should deal with this issue, or whether the issue should proceed directly to international negotiations. <B>83</B> <font size=2>(&quot;EU/Media Commission Studies Mechanism for Preliminary Notification of National Draft Legislation on Internet ICRT's Position,&quot; Agence Europe (Brussels), April 26, 1996.)</font></P><P>That same week in Strasbourg, Irish Minister of State for European Affairs Gay Mitchell called on the EU to investigate controls on the transmission of child pornography on the Internet at a joint meeting organized by UNICEF and the Council of Europe, to discuss the commercial exploitation of children. <B>84</B> <font size=2>(Patrick Smyth, &quot;Mitchell Argues for World Wide Register of Paedophiles,&quot; Irish Times (Dublin), April 26, 1996.)</font></P><P>The European Commission reportedly plans to draft a discussion paper on interactive services, including the Internet, which may lead to a directive that may include content regulation. The European Commission is considering a regulation requiring EU member states to send draft national legislation affecting the Internet to the EU in order for member states to vet the laws before they are adopted. The European Commission is reportedly divided over how to standardize Internet policies of its member states. The European Parliament has introduced changes to the EU's broadcasting law to extend its scope to the Internet, but that approach is strongly opposed by many in the computer industry. <B>85</B> <font size=2>(Fiona McHugh, &quot;European Commission Makes Moves to Co-ordinate Policing of EU Cyberspace,&quot; Media and Marketing Europe (London), April 3, 1996.)</font></P><H3>United Kingdom</H3><P>The UK has not yet enacted any Internet-specific censorship legislation but has relied, instead, on existing laws banning obscenity. Gay groups, however, reportedly feel they are being victimized. An organizer for the London-based group, S&amp;M Gays, for example, told the press that &quot;The police seem to have great difficulty in distinguishing between gay men and pedophiles.&quot; <B>86</B> <font size=2>(Liberty, &quot;Caught in the Net,&quot; Agenda (London), June 1995.)</font> The group closed down its computer bulletin board, fearing that it might become a police target.</P><P>In its recent proposals for media ownership, the UK government suggested that the media industry regulator could have some influence over the content of the Internet. An inter-departmental group was set up in March 1995 to examine tackling such issues as sexually explicit material on the Internet. <B>87</B> <font size=2>(Cath Everett, &quot;Internet Pedophile Case Exposes Gaps in the Law,&quot; Computing (London)</font> , January 4, 1996. A new defamation bill extending libel to computer networks was introduced in February 1996; it provides a defense for ISPs as long as they are do not knowingly permit a defamatory statement to be made over their networks. On-line service providers have asked the government for further clarification on their responsibilities under the legislation.</P><P>In March 1996, British Trade and Industry Minister Ian Taylor said the UK was seeking a voluntary approach to regulation of content on the Internet. The Internet Service Providers Association (ISPA), a voluntary grouping of service providers to be formally launched in May 1996, is drawing up a code of practice that will cover fair trading issues, and Taylor said that he expected the code to cover &quot;both illegal and undesirable material.&quot; He added, &quot;The only alternative to voluntary action ... is increased political pressure for legislation in various areas. That pressure may get increasingly hard to resist.&quot; <B>88</B> <font size=2>(&quot;UK Back Voluntary Web Censorship,&quot; New Media Age (London), March 28, 1996.)</font></P><H3>France</H3><P>On March 15, 1996, French ISPs were subpoenaed after a French Jewish student organization brought charges against them for alleged &quot;complicity&quot; in making available propaganda that denies the Holocaust; such propaganda is illegal in France. A decision was to be reached in April, as this report went to press.</P><H3>Germany</H3><P>Germany and CompuServe have both been criticized for their roles in the CompuServe censorship episode. CompuServe and the German officials involved have made conflicting statements regarding who actually made the decision to censor Usenet newsgroups. As far as Human Rights Watch has been able to determine, a task force was set up by the Bavarian minister of the interior at police headquarters in Munich in 1994 to search for on-line child pornography. The task force obtained a search warrant to investigate the Munich CompuServe office on November 22, 1995.The search was reportedly more like a visit, in which the authorities told the company of their concerns and CompuServe agreed to comply. Two days later, CompuServe's German managers reportedly stated that they would support German authorities' fight against pornography in cyberspace. On December 8, the authorities gave them a list of more than 200 suggested newsgroups with a letter saying &quot;...it is left to CompuServe to take the necessary steps to avoid possible liabilities to punishment.&quot; CompuServe then made the decision to take all the groups off its servers, apparently without making the effort to look at them. Among the groups it &quot;banned&quot; were discussion groups for homosexuals and the news service Clarinet, which was not even on its servers.</P><P>As with other instances of Internet censorship, the ban was an ineffective effort to comply with the demands of an ill-informed authority. CompuServe users still of course had access to the Internet and could therefore connect to other host computers that carried the forbidden newsgroups. In February, CompuServe again provided access to the 200 formerly censored newsgroups, except for five groups. The Bavarian minister of justice recently claimed that CompuServe's new Cyber Patrol software does not meet the company's obligations under German law because the company has an obligation not to supply illegal material to German citizens.</P><P>Moving from sexually explicit material to hate speech, in January 1996, Deutsche Telekom (DT), the national telephone company, blocked users of its T-Online computer network from accessing Internet sites used to spread anti-Semitic propaganda, which is a crime in Germany. Authorities also announced that they were expanding their investigation to America Online and Deutsche Forschungsnetz, the national scientific research network. The company was responding to demands by Mannheim prosecutors who were investigating Ernst Zuendel, a German-born neo-Nazi living in Toronto. DT also blocked access to a Santa Cruz, California computer service, Web Communications, that also provides access to Zuendel's site. Web Communications stated that although it did not agree with Zuendel, it was not the company's policy to censor its users. A DT spokesman said that access to certain providers was blocked while government prosecutors investigated on-line neo-Nazi material. The lack of organized monitoring by DT is reflected in the fact that Zuendel's Web site was still available through CompuServe at the same time as it was &quot;banned&quot; through Web Communications. <B>89</B> <font size=2>(Reuters, January 25, 1996, and &quot;German Service Cuts Net Access,&quot; San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, California), January 27, 1996.)</font></P><P>Rita Suessmuth, president of the Bundestag, the German parliament, was recently quoted in German newspapers as saying, &quot;The information superhighway must not be allowed to become a forum for those who defile children.&quot; She added, &quot;Freedom of expression reaches its limit when human dignity is violated and violence is promoted.&quot; <B>90</B> <font size=2>(&quot;Bundestag Seeks World Curbs on Internet Child Porn,&quot; Media Daily (Wilton, Connecticut), February 13, 1996.)</font> The government reportedly disagrees with her assessment, however. Justice Minister Edzard Schmidt-Jortzig said in late March 1996 that the government would introduceInternet censorship legislation before the summer recess. The legislation will seek to punish an ISP only if it knowingly permits illegal material on its service, but will not expect ISPs to be responsible for all the content on their servers. <B>91</B> <font size=2>(Andrew Gray, &quot;Germany Plans Bill to Punish Internet Indecency,&quot; Reuters, March 29, 1996.)</font> The legislation is expected to face opposition from the regional states, who plan to contest the measure on constitutional grounds and may propose a more restrictive law. <B>92</B> <font size=2>( Ibid.)</font></P></blockquote><IMG SRC="tealtxtm.gif"><P><A HREF="hrw7.htm"><IMG SRC="tealprev.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="Previous Page"></A><A HREF="hrw9.htm"><IMG SRC="tealnext.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="Next Page"></A><A HREF="index.htm"><IMG SRC="tealinde.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="See File"></A></P></BODY></HTML>

<h2>Conclusion: Principles of free expression on the GII</h2>
<img width=650 height=1 src="../../newsflash_pix/news_line.jpg"></CENTER><br><br clear=all><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Rather than striving to control content on the Internet, democratic governments should be working to ensure that the GII becomes truly global, and to motivate citizens to become more involved in decision making as they organize, debate, and share information unrestricted by geographic distances or national borders. It has already been shown that the GII has the potential to:</P><UL><LI>permit individuals with common interests to organize themselves in forums to debate public policy issues;<LI>provide instant access to a wide range of information;<LI>increase citizen oversight of government affairs;<LI>decentralize political decision making;<LI>empower users to become active producers of information rather than passive consumers.</UL><P>As noted above, although the extraordinary potential for a GII has been suggested by existing on-line communications networks, the present on-line community is still quite limited. Only countries with a sophisticated telecommunications infrastructure are able to take full advantage of on-line technology. Even in countries with advanced telecommunications infrastructures, only persons with access to equipment and training can take advantage of new information resources. General illiteracy remains the primary obstacle to computer literacy. And while the GII may foster an unprecedented sharing of cultural traditions, current users of on-line technology are primarily American or northern European, affluent, white, and male. </P><P>To maximize the GII's potential to promote democracy, it must adopt and expand upon international standards of free expression. National and international guarantees of free expression should be expressly extended to the Internet.</P></blockquote><IMG SRC="tealtxtm.gif"><P><A HREF="hrw10.htm"><IMG SRC="tealprev.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="Previous Page"></A><A HREF="hrw12.htm"><IMG SRC="tealnext.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="Next Page"></A><A HREF="index.htm"><IMG SRC="tealinde.gif" WIDTH = 32 HEIGHT = 32 BORDER = 0 ALT="See File"></A></P></BODY></HTML>

EU Council of Development Ministers<br>
Statement issued following the Special Meeting of European Union Development and Humanitarian Aid Ministers, Brussels, 7 November 1996</h2>
Source: <A HREF="../../liaison/index.html">Liaison Comittee of Development NGO's to the European Union</A></h4></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
1.	A special meeting of European Union development and humanitarian aid
Ministers was held in Brussels on 7 November 1996 to examine recent
developments in the Great Lakes Region and to discuss the humanitarian
situation of refugees and displaced people in eastern Zaire and ways and
means to bring about an easing of the humanitarian crisis and an enhancement
of the prospects for a sustainable solution.  The meeting was chaired by the
Minister of State, Joan Burton T.D. of Ireland and was attended by
development and humanitarian aid Ministers or representatives from all EU
Member States.  The Commission was represented by Mrs Emma Bonino and Prof J
. Pinheiro.
<P>
2.	Commissioner Pinheiro made a short general statement on the situation
facing the Great Lakes Region and Commissioner  Bonino briefed Ministers on
the humanitarian response of the Commission to the crisis to date and
presented a plan of action, which will be examined immediately and in more
detail in the competent committee on humanitarian aid. Commissioner Bonino
emphasised the urgency of immediate intervention to alleviate the suffering
of refugees and displaced people and presented ideas concerning future
action.  The EU Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region, Mr Ajello, briefed
the meeting on the current complex political situation in the region.  Mr
Akashi, Under-Secretary of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), Mrs
. Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs  Bellamy, Director of UNICEF
, Mr Graisse, Assistant Executive Director of World Food Programme and Mr De
Courtin, Director of Operations for the International Committee of the Red
Cross also gave briefings on the evolving humanitarian situation in the
region.
<P>
3.	The meeting reaffirmed the Union's deep concern at the deteriorating
situation in Eastern Zaire and the threat posed to peace and stability in
the entire Great Lakes Region. The meeting reaffirmed the Union's
determination and commitment to do everything in its power to help and to
assist immediately vulnerable people, refugees and displaced persons in
Eastern Zaire, in averting further human tragedy there and in avoiding a
potentially catastrophic humanitarian disaster in the region.  The meeting
also reiterated the view of the Union that the complex problems at issue can
only be resolved through early and substantive dialogue and called again on
all parties concerned, including in particular Zaire and Rwanda, to begin
such a process as soon as possible. The meeting acknowledged the strong
interconnection between the immediate humanitarian requirements and the
broader political issues underlying the conflict and the need to address
them in a comprehensive way.
<P>
4.	In this regard, the meeting expressed full support for the efforts of the
United Nations, regional leaders and the Organisation of African Unity to
facilitate a peaceful and comprehensive resolution of the conflict and
reaffirmed the Union's commitment to assist in every way possible.  It
welcomed the outcome of the Nairobi Summit of Heads of State of the region
on 5 November.  The meeting endorsed the call by the Heads of State in their
Press Statement for an immediate ceasefire which should be strictly observed
to enable the intensification of diplomatic efforts to achieve lasting peace
.  The meeting shared the view expressed by the Regional Heads of State 
concerning the importance of the territorial integrity of Zaire, in
accordance with the OAU Charter and, in particular, the Cairo Declaration of
1964,  an end to cross-border incursions and  the inalienable rights of all
people, including those of citizenship and nationality. The meeting welcomed
the call by the Heads of State for the immediate setting up of safe
corridors and temporary sanctuaries inside Zaire to facilitate humanitarian
assistance and the repatriation of refugees and noted their request in this
regard to the Security Council for the deployment of a "neutral force".  The
meeting also welcomed the call by the Heads of State for the intensification
of efforts towards voluntary repatriation of refugees to Rwanda and the
"implementation of the long-standing decision to separate the intimidators
and bona fide refugees". The meeting also underlined the importance of
support for the democratic process in Zaire.
<P>
5.	The meeting noted that special arrangements were urgently required in the
short term to ensure a stable security situation in Eastern Zaire, to
facilitate both the necessary humanitarian tasks and the process of dialogue
.  It noted that efforts to this end were being pursued by the Security
Council, taking into account recent proposals which have been made. The
French and Spanish Ministers briefed the meeting on their proposal in this
regard for a temporary force for strictly humanitarian purposes in order to
enable the delivery of aid to the populations concerned.
<P>
6.	In this context, the meeting recalled the Conclusions of the European
Council in Florence on 21-22 June 1996 which indicated that the Council
"continues to support the convening of an international conference under the
joint auspices of the UN and the Organisation of African Unity in order to
address within a global approach the root causes of the crises and to ensure
respect for commitments".
<P>
7.	The meeting expressed its warm appreciation of the efforts of the EU
Special Envoy in seeking, on behalf of the EU, to facilitate a peaceful
resolution of the conflict and the addressing of the immediate humanitarian
requirements and welcomed the fact that Mr Ajello would be continuing his
work in the region in that regard. It looked forward to close coordination
between him and the newly appointed Special Envoy of the Secretary General
of the United Nations, Ambassador Raymond Chr&#233;tien.
<P>
8.	The meeting agreed to send immediately a special mission of development
Ministers from Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy together with Commissioner
Bonino to make an assessment of the humanitarian situation and to identify
ways and means to speed up humanitarian assistance. The EU Special Envoy
will also participate in the mission. The conclusions of this mission will
be transmitted urgently to the General Affairs Council.
<P>
9.	The meeting recalled the Union's commitment to promote the voluntary
return of refugees to their countries of origin. It strongly underlined the
need to ensure safe and protected humanitarian corridors in order to
facilitate the delivery of immediate relief supplies to the victims of the
crisis where they are, as well as the voluntary safe and dignified return of
 refugees to their countries of origin. The need for support for development
efforts as well as for strengthening the legal system notably within Rwanda
to facilitate the integration of returned refugees was also noted.
<P>
10.	The meeting agreed on the need to work in a coordinated manner with
international humanitarian agencies and NGOs to ensure an effective
humanitarian response to the crisis and underlined the coordinating role of
the DHA in the UN system.  It noted the resource needs of the humanitarian
agencies and agreed on the importance of ensuring that aid resources are
made available for agreed priorities as a matter of urgency. The meeting
called on all parties in the region to ensure the safety and freedom of
movement of all international humanitarian aid personnel.
<P>
11.	Since the beginning of the crisis in the Great Lakes Region in 1994, the
European Community and its Member States have provided in the order of 755
MECU in humanitarian aid. At the meeting, the humanitarian agencies
indicated  that they will be shortly in a position to approach the Community
and the Member States regarding precise requirements and needs.  It was
agreed that the most urgent consideration will be given to these appeals.  
<P>
12.	Ministers emphasised that the scale of the current humanitarian crisis
in the Great Lakes Region calls for a coherent and concerted international
response.  It was reaffirmed  that the Union will play its full part in this
task.

<TR><TD>Abstract <TD>The relation between the Community and its member states in the field of development cooperation is a very complex issue, especially when it comes up to decision making. Traditionally the member states have tried to control the Commission to a great extent but have not been ready to accept any substantial coordination of their bilateral development assistance, which reduced the overall efficiency of the European aid. The Maastricht treaty initiated a process that should lead to a systematic operational and political coordination with, potentially, a new repartition of tasks between the community and its member states. The treaty also stipulates for outmost coherence of any policies with implications for development countries.

<B>Braveheart</B> <i>by Shirly-Anne Hardy</i>









<p>

We all arrive on this planet from some mysterious Beyond. Yet, on arrival, some find themselves having to pay others for living space. We pray, "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven". What a mockery of Christianity!

<p>

Let us enquire: to whom did the first man to stake out a claim to land pay money for it...? Well then, what is he doing taking money for it from someone else? Isn't it obvious that the whole thing is just a game, and that the name of the game is power? - the power of the few over the mass of dispossessed.

<p>

The outcome of this game is inevitably an increasing number of those who, having no right of land on which to work their skills, become the 'unemployed'; looking to others for the opportunity  to labour - and beating down wages against each other in that bitter, bogus struggle for work. But the existence of a cheap pool of 'unemployed' to call upon has ever been one of the winning aces of those who hold the cards of power.

<p>

Any attempt to deal with the land question, therefore, which fails to deal with DISPOSSESSION AS A WHOLE, is manifestly simply skating on the surface of things - betraying the real claims of the dispossessed, and turning a deaf ear to those growing hordes now clustering in our cities without a roof. In the words of Solzenitsyn: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>

'And while some danced happy and carefree with songs and music, others shed tears which no hand could wipe away... How did this happen? How could such a gulf have opened out? The words fade away and disappear like water - without taste, without colour, without a trace.'

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<center><blockquote><b>Braveheart laid plainly before our eyes the corruptive influence upon a nation of landed power

</b></blockquote></center><p>

To restore to the dispossessed their minimal right of justice upon earth - to remove the monstrous power obtained by some over others through pre-empting earth's living space - we must remove in its entirety the bogus selling-price of land. That is, we must remove its capital value, this being the base upon which the right to monopolise land is founded. How shall this capital value be removed? There is ONE WAY AND ONE WAY ONLY, and that is : by society's collecting the full rental value of its land, site by site - or acreage by acreage - from every occupant every year. For it is this value (entirely community-created) which - left lying upon the land uncollected - then yields to the claim of ownership by the 'owner' of the land; and it is purely the on-going expectation of this privately collectible rent which builds onto land its false capital value, its lucrative selling price, which in turn makes an investment asset of land, encouraging monopoly.

<p>

What, then, are we doing with conferences on land reform that propose, for example, merely restrictions on the buying of land by foreigners? What can this possibly achieve except a larger field of expectations for our own grandees - while the poor wretched rent-payer remains trapped precisely as before? Or why focus reform on areas of land above an acre? Phew! - what price half an acre of prime city land? It is the entire bogus apparatus of our present land ownership system that needs to go.

<p>

Right now we are being re-awakened, by the film BRAVEHEART, to the courageous life of William Wallace - 'Guardian of Scotland' deservedly named. What we need is another film linking William Wallace's great endeavour with that of another William - William Ogilvie of Aberdeen, who 500 years later dedicated himself no less to the freeing of the Scots, by his radical writings on land reform. For did not Wallace himself give attention to this matter of rights to land, in a document which had bearing on the famous Declaration of Arbroath? The film certainly shows how detestable was, to Wallace - a man of the people - the mean dependence upon the landed power of his time of the mass of his fellow countrymen.

<p>

If we would but be humble enough to search our own history, instead of trying to pattern ourselves upon alien economic fashions, we would find in it all the inspiration that we need now. For William Ogilvie was but one of a string of Scots who grasped the fact that the faithful collection by a nation of its land rent will of itself effect a just and radical redistribution of the land, with - upon payment of that rent - full security of tenure to the occupant, and the abolition of the entire false system of taxation besides.

<p>

As Thomas Paine put it in his famous The Rights of Man: 'Whoever heard that the Creator opened an estate-office to issue title deeds?' But those bogus estate-offices will remain securely in business until the Scots themselves awaken and grasp the true thistle of Scotland's genius in land reform.

<p>

We must be prepared today not only to remake our own history, but to remake it aright. Nothing - bar the shining  integrity of Wallace - was, in the whole of BRAVEHEART, laid more plainly before our eyes, than the corruptive influence upon a nation, of landed power, and that no people can ever be truly free until that corruptive power is completely wiped out. Just as then - so now.

<B>Beating Back the Bandits</B> <i>by John Seymour</i>



<P>

Every activity of mankind on this planet pays a tax to the landowner.

<p>

Everything we buy or use during our lives in a country like England costs us more than it should because of this tax to the landowner. A person living in a bed-sit in Camden Town may not realise it but a large component of his rent goes - not to the owner of the building he is in - but to the hereditary owner of the land the building is on. Somebody built it - or paid somebody to do so - but nobody built the land under it. No man has ever made land.

<p>

But city people are utterly indifferent as to who owns the land of their country. They just don't think it concerns them. It should.

<p>

We are all being taxed, all our lives, by a tiny handful of people who own the land.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

'And how did you come by it?' asked the tramp, who was being ordered out of a field by a landowner.

'I inherited it from my ancestors my good man.'

'And how did they come by it?'

'They fought for it!'

'Right!' said the tramp. And he took off his coat.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

A few - a very few - countries have achieved some measure of land reform. Denmark passed a law in 1880 taking the land from the landlords and giving it to the farmers who farmed it. Which is why Danish products compete so successfully with English ones. Ireland, the country I live in, achieved land reform partly by buying out the English landlords in the nineteenth century and then completely by compulsory purchasing the land after Independence. Irish farmers now own the land they farm and are the better for it. Many a government in Third World countries has tried to get land reform but in every case has been put out of office by a military coup. The Officer Corps comes from the landowning class.

<p>

England, alas, is still a conquered country. After 1066 William the Conqueror dished out every acre of the land out to his fellow bandits, and the pattern of land ownership established then has never been broken. It is time it is.



<center><blockquote><b>land reform could be achieved ... by a graduated tax on land.</b></blockquote></center>



The only possible way in which land reform could be achieved with complete fairness and with lasting results, would be to impose a graduated tax on land. That is a tax that would increase in severity the more land was owned by an individual. For example - a person who owned ten acres of grade A agricultural land might pay nothing, a person who owned a hundred acres might pay ten pounds an acre, a person who owned a thousand acres might pay one hundred pounds an acre. Thus the latter would find it essential to put at least some of his land on the market - the price of land would plummet and you or I might be able to buy some. The result of such a tax would be that land would become far more evenly spread among the population - and it might stay that way. The tax could be very gently applied at first and then racked up as necessary to keep an even flow of land onto the market. If more land was put on the market than the market could absorb then the government would step in and buy land, very cheaply, to make into wilderness areas and nature reserves, but most of the land put on the market would no doubt be bought up by private individuals. And the latter would not buy more than their fair share - they wouldn't want to pay punitive tax on it.

<p>

The big landowners would not like it? The big landowners would have to put up with it. The Saxon peasants did not like it when William the Conqueror's lackeys came and stole their land away from them after 1066.

<p>

Most city people don't want land anyway? No - well they wouldn't have to have it. Only people who wanted land - and therefore would be most likely to look after it - would bother to buy it.

<p>

One good point about such a tax is that it would tax the people who have more than their fair share of our country and the taxes would go to help those with less than their fair share. Another advantage would be that it would lead to a gradual movement out of the swollen conurbations into the countryside again, as more and more people moved out to claim what is, after all, their birthright: their fair share of their country.

<p>

Surely we should work towards a world in which nobody has too much but everybody has enough?

<B>An Open Letter to Tony Blair</B> <I>by Ronald Banks</i>



<P>

Dear Tony Blair

<p>

So! You think you can win the next General Election. But what makes you think you can deal with the economic problems which beset the nation at this moment, and which will not go away?

<p>

Massive social spending that necessitates higher taxes which hurt  production, spending cuts which harm the worst off in society, or a combination of both, all of which produce a vicious circle not capable of resolution?

<p>

Economists have given you a limited toolbag. There is no perception within the economic discipline of how to solve the western world's problems. It needs a giant shift of imagination for new avenues to be opened up to expand the economic discipline.

<p>

Take the 'feel good' factor. This is predicated upon some kind of inflation  - not too much (or else there is too much public concern) - but enough to produce constantly rising house prices. This also produces what is known as the 'wealth effect', a phenomenon which in 1988 created a bank and building society second loan explosion of £24bn over a 12-month period. This far outdistanced the £5.7bn give-away which the Chancellor Lawson created in the budget that spring. Supply problems followed which meant a massive increase in spending on foreign goods, leading to deficits in foreign trade. Home grown supply was unable to cope.

<p>

The 'feel good' factor is always a precursor of the 'feel bad' factor, which entails the 'cure' to restore the 'feel good' factor - high interest rates, higher taxes and expenditure cuts which hurt the most vulnerable in society.



<center><blockquote><b>The proposition is that you call for a "no tax" strategy for which the economic basis is the concept of public and private value.</b></blockquote></center>



If governments are really serious about keeping inflation under control, which the Tories have done 'successfully' during the recession years, then what we are experiencing today is the likely on-going 'feel good' factor with only a little improvement. This is it! The new 'feel good' factor, unless inflation is allowed to rise again.

<p>

The proposition is that you call for a 'no tax' strategy for which the economic basis is the concept of public and private value.

<p>

Expectations need to be changed. Unrealistic expectations, whether in personal finances, health and education, have to be tackled by all political parties - unless new economic policies can be introduced which cut through these limitations. Certainly, feelings of relative security in the job market are not going to be there. They are never there for the employees in the Pacific Basin, the most dynamic economies in the world at the present time. Jobs for life may be the old fashioned objective of the trades union movement, but modern economies will not be predicated on such a notion.

<p>

The new economic paradigm which I am urging you to consider encompasses a revitalised public revenue programme - collecting revenue while at the same time cutting taxes. A contradiction? Not if we return to classical economics or, more properly, neo-classical economics, where land and its rent assume their proper place in the debate about public finance.

<p>

The proposition is that you call for a 'No Tax' strategy! There are some taxes which need to be kept - not for revenue purposes (although the revenue collected will be substantial) but mainly of reasons of health and energy conservation. Tobacco and alcohol taxes would stay, with a tax of some sort to promote energy conservation (including the present tax on motor fuel). Although these taxes are for specific, non-financial reason, the revenue will be considerable. 

<p>

The economic basis for the 'no tax' strategy is the concept of public and private value. Failure to distinguish between these two concepts has kept economics in a parlous situation for 100 years or more. The merging of the two 'values' has seriously hindered a more just system of public revenue collection. Value is currently taxed from whatever source it comes. This means that private endeavour is taxed and therefore discouraged, while windfall profits from the value of public works are taxed only on the same basis as value from private endeavour, if at all.

<p>

This latter point needs elaboration. the fact that taxes on private endeavour discourage production, employment and saving is axiomatic. However, there is a value, a public value, which lends itself as a suitable and fair source to finance public expenditure. The Labour Party has had many attempts to implement such a policy. They tried in the early twenties and again in 1931. Herbert Morrison also tried in 1939, specifically for London. The policy attempt was a good one, and comes close to what I am suggesting.

<p>

After the second World War, Labour lost its way in this area and introduced several policies which had the opposite effect of what was intended.

<p>

Our proposals deal with a number of aspirations which the Labour Party has had for most of its existence. These include: a just land policy for all citizens; sweeping away unjustified profits from speculative deals on land; a banking system which funds and finances productive investment and not speculative land deals; a tax policy which leaves earned income free of taxation and raises public revenue from income derived from public investment. All of this leads to a positive impact on the economy, especially on jobs and productivity and the ability of the public purse to provide for the needs of the most vulnerable in society.



<center><blockquote><b>...a policy which will redress injustice and revitalise the economy to everyone's benefit.</b></blockquote></center>



Conservatives call themselves the 'tax cutting' party, with very little evidence to show that to be true. The Labour Party can call itself the 'no tax' party - a powerful counter to the Tory case. Of course, the case needs to be carefully presented and obvious Tory objections catered for. This we can do with you and your team.

<p>

 In the late 1960s and 1970s, when the Liberals were hawking their local tax strategy, which they called Site Value Rating (a poor substitute for the grand strategy we are urging), the Conservative counter-attack included the claim that the "Liberals were taking the ground from under peoples' feet". This was a recognition that under our proposals the price of land would be reduced, possibly close to zero.

<p>

In all taxation changes, as is obvious, there are winners and losers. And, of course, there will be some heavy criticism from the big losers, who will include not only big landlords but the institutions which finance them. None of these institutions can expect to retain the privileges which they enjoy at the expense of the rest of the community, but all of them would benefit from the cuts in taxation.

<p>

We have mentioned these negative aspects from the very start because they have to be taken seriously. However, they do not constitute a reason for not introducing a policy which will redress injustice and revitalise the economy to everyone's benefit.

<p>

On the immediate credit side, these proposals will be to the immediate benefit of a number of 'constituencies', sufficiently numerous to win any election.

<p>

This is the plan. After valuation of all land in the United Kingdom, its annual 'rent' will be published to allow for appeals and any inconsistencies to be redressed. This annual rent will represent the amount of public revenue available to the public purse for the first year of operation. This will also be the figure (estimated to be at least 20% of the GNP) for cutting taxes. The Government must not cheat! The amount of land rent collected must be balanced by an equivalent tax cut.

<p>

The type of tax cut will vary with the Government's priorities in economic policy. For higher employment, the tax cut will be targeted at employer's national insurance contributions, maybe corporation tax, and any existing tax which is perceived to discourage employment.

<p>

For increased investment and research, the target will be corporation tax. (These tax cuts will, of course, have a positive impact on other parts of the economy.) To increase spending in the shops, the targets will be VAT and cuts in income taxes.

<p>

What should be deduced from the above is the kind  of 'constituency' which would benefit immediately without any need to take account of balances between tax cuts and land rent due to be paid.

<p>

Most property owners would find the payment of land rent would be less than the benefits they receive from the tax cuts

<p>

The poor, the homeless and the unemployed, all classes with very little or no interest in landed property, would gain from the tax cuts. No negative effects! Most property owners would find the payment of land rent would be less than the benefits they receive  from the tax cuts. This would be the case for most of middle England, a primary Labour Party target for winning the General Election.



<center><blockquote><b>Most property owners would find the payment of land rent would be less than the benefits they receive from the tax cuts.</b></blockquote></center>



Those who make a profit solely out of land, renting out residential or commercial property, would probably lose, although this is not certain, since the tax cuts would also apply to these classes. The mechanism for evaluating this balance between land rent due and tax cuts is to capitalise the tax cuts and compare this figure with the reduction in the value of the taxpayer's property. Most home owners will be better off because so much more public value will be collected to compensate. Home owners will also recognise that housing for their children and grandchildren will be easier under this scheme.

<p>

The valuation process itself is a simple matter. Hector Wilks handled two valuations in Whitstable, Kent, in 1963 and 1973. The whole country could be covered within a year, with a further six months for appeals.

<p>

One of the really exciting features of this policy is the basis for our optimism for the future: taxation reduces land rent to a considerable extent. The higher the taxation, the lower the land rent.

Just consider the effect on the economy of the first year's tax cuts and the collection of land rent for public revenue. The impetus to the economy would be immense: from increased employment, increased productivity, higher spending and greater confidence and security. From all these factors, land rents would rise again! A further valuation would give a new figure for land rent collection and, therefore, a new figure for more tax cuts.

<p>

 The ultimate result would be effectively to abolish taxation, with the exception of those health and energy taxes mentioned above. The title of the above policy: 'Land Rent as Public revenue'.

<p>

 It will take a huge imaginative shift (and a lot of courage) for a political party  to espouse this proposition. But there is a big prize there for the taking. The British economy, along with others in the western world, is close to economic collapse. The huge demands for funding the ever-growing social and health needs in the future is becoming intolerable. Your own policy ideas are just tinkering at the edges - a more efficient and humane version of Conservative Party policies.

<p>

You want a 'Big Idea' to ensure victory at the next General Election - here it is!

<p>

Yours sincerely

Ronald Banks

<hr>
Les strat&#233;gies de d&#233;veloppement de l'apr&#232;s-
ind&#233;pendance ont attribu&#233; &#224; l'Etat un r&#244;le
directeur dans la gestion du d&#233;veloppement, souvent au
d&#233;triment d'autres acteurs de la soci&#233;t&#233;. Ceci a
conduit le secteur public &#224; se d&#233;velopper bien au-
del&#224; de ses possibilit&#233;s financi&#232;res et de gestion. Au cours des ann&#233;es 1980, un
consensus global est apparu quant aux limites de l'impact de
l'action du secteur public pour favoriser la croissance et le
d&#233;veloppement. La nouvelle doctrine n&#233;olib&#233;rale met
l'accent sur l'ajustement, la d&#233;r&#233;glementation et la
privatisation. C'est plus particuli&#232;rement en Afrique sub-
saharienne, que l'on s'en est pris &#224; la mainmise de l'Etat sur
le d&#233;veloppement. Les programmes d'ajustement structurel ont
remis en cause le monopole du pouvoir dont disposait l'Etat, et
l'Etat africain, autrefois unique r&#233;cipiendaire et partenaire
de l'aide internationale, a perdu son statut d'organe le plus favoris&#233. Ces changements ont permis aux autres acteurs du d&#233;veloppement d'occuper la
place ainsi lib&#233;r&#233;e et ont contribu&#233; &#224; l'acheminement vers le processus de d&#233;mocratisation. Simultan&#233;ment, le concept de "bonne gouvernance" est devenu le dernier terme en vogue.
<p>
Ces derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, la progression g&#233;n&#233;rale de cette nouvelle orthodoxie du
d&#233;veloppement s'est vue contest&#233;e. On peut d&#233;gager quatre raisons principales
&#224; l'origine de ce ph&#233;nom&#232;ne. Premi&#232;rement, se contenter de "faire reculer
l'Etat" s'est r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; ne pas &#234;tre la panac&#233;e. Les politiques mises en place
pour r&#233;duire la taille et les co–ts de l'administration, par exemple, ont caus&#233; une diminution
dramatique des niveaux des salaires, &#224; un tel point que le secteur public n'a plus &#233;t&#233;
en mesure d'attirer ou de retenir la main-d'oeuvre qualifi&#233;e. Par cons&#233;quent, les
capacit&#233;s ont souvent diminu&#233; jusqu'&#224; atteindre des niveaux dangereusement faibles.
<p>
Deuxi&#232;mement, le d&#233;bat "Etat contre march&#233;", qui n'est pas nouveau, a perdu de son
int&#233;r&#234;t. La privatisation immod&#233;r&#233;e et le d&#233;mant&#232;lement de l'Etat
ont &#233;t&#233; per‡us comme &#233;tant tout autant des erreurs que l'engagement sans
r&#233;serve en faveur d'une organisation bureaucratique et centraliste qui avait
pr&#233;c&#233;d&#233. L'exp&#233;rience en Asie de l'Est met en
lumi&#232;re le r&#244;le d&#233;terminant d'un gouvernement fort et efficace, et on
estime qu'un syst&#232;me d'administration publique africain "offensif" requiert un r&#244;le et un domaine d'intervention bien d&#233;finis ainsi que l'aptitude &#224; d&#233;terminer les degr&#233;s optimaux de son engagement.
<p>
Troisi&#232;mement, la recherche indique que les liens entre la d&#233;mocratisation et le
d&#233;veloppement demeurent accidentels. Les pays en voie de
d&#233;veloppement qui ont r&#233;ussi &#224; d&#233;clencher la croissance et &#224; r&#233;duire
la pauvret&#233; sont g&#233;n&#233;ralement ceux dont les politiques ont rassembl&#233;
suffisamment de pouvoir, de probit&#233;, d'autonomie et de comp&#233;tence pour &#233;laborer,
poursuivre et encourager la r&#233;alisation d'objectifs de d&#233;veloppement explicites et
d&#233;termin&#233;s au niveau national.
<p>
Quatri&#232;mement, les limites des acteurs de "la soci&#233;t&#233; civile" en tant qu'agents du
d&#233;veloppement sont de plus en plus reconnues. En g&#233;n&#233;ral, les acteurs de la
soci&#233;t&#233; civile, y compris les ONG, sont encore tr&#232;s faibles en ce qui concerne
l'organisation et des doutes ont &#233;t&#233; &#233;mis quant &#224; leur capacit&#233; de produire
des effets significatifs sur les r&#233;formes des politiques. Dans de nombreux cas, la distinction entre
Etat et soci&#233;t&#233; civile n'est pas &#233;vidente, et certains sont conscients du fait que
d'innombrables organisations de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile, op&#233;rant en dehors des cadres des
politiques nationales, obtiendront peu de r&#233;sultats en termes de traitement des probl&#232;mes de
d&#233;veloppement de l'Afrique.
<p>
Bien que les partisans d'un Etat bureaucratique fortement centralis&#233; soit tr&#232;s peu nombreux,
on est peut-&#234;tre all&#233; trop loin dans la r&#233;duction du domaine d'action du secteur public.
L'important, aujourd'hui, est d'assurer la transition d'un r&#244;le o&#249; [les gouvernements]
dominaient le processus des politiques de d&#233;veloppement &#224; un r&#244;le o&#249; ils
fournissent un environnement favorable aux divers acteurs institutionnels relativement autonomes.
<p>
Ce document fournit un exemple concret d'un processus de transition de ce type dans la gestion des
ressources de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. La coop&#233;ration
d&#233;centralis&#233;e fut l'une des innovations de la quatri&#232;me Convention de Lom&#233;
sign&#233;e en 1989 entre l'Union europ&#233;enne (UE) et 69 Etats ACP (Afrique, Cara&#239;bes
et Pacifique). Elle permet &#224; un grand nombre d'acteurs du d&#233;veloppement de
b&#233;n&#233;ficier des ressources de Lom&#233;, ce qui, par le pass&#233;, &#233;tait l'apanage
des agences des gouvernements centraux. Cette innovation refl&#233;tait les conceptions en
&#233;volution (des donateurs) quant &#224; la relation Etat-soci&#233;t&#233; et aux modalit&#233;s
de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. Cependant la mise en pratique de ce concept s'est
r&#233;v&#233;l&#233;e difficile et les r&#233;sultats de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement
obtenus jusqu'&#224; pr&#233;sent dans le cadre de Lom&#233; IV sont maigres.

It would be, in his words, 'one of my international marathon documentaries - certain to be my last'.  <p>In this film Ophuls at first intended to reflect on the major conflicts of this century, showing how journalists were in the front line, both in the sense of sharing the danger of the action and in the sense of being the first witnesses to history. It was the struggle between power and the media - self-censorship, jingoism, the thirst for a scoop, the exploitation of suffering, the taste for showmanship - which would be Ophuls' subject. Unsurprisingly CBS, 'seeing my enthusiasm, were quick to back down'.<p><center><img height=2 width=520 src="ophuls_pix/troubles_line.gif"></center><p><img align=left height=120 width=197 hspace=12 vspace=8 src="ophuls_pix/bunker.gif">When Ophuls finally gathered enough finance to begin the project he was convinced that its centrepiece would be a report from some contemporary frontline, observing the journalists of our time in the full practice of their profession. It was what he called 'my coathanger principle' - a device about which to dispose his stories. He would travel to a conflict of our times, plot nothing but lean back and allow reality to come as it would. And on this material he would hang his story. In December 1992, still without much of the finance to mount the film, he boarded the night train to Munich with a cameraman friend. He was bound for Sarajevo as, he subsequently confessed, a naive tourist going to a reputedly very dangerous place without much idea of what was going on.<br clear=left><p>As the film emerged from the cutting room, it was clear that Ophuls' coathanger had become something much more substantial. The contemporary no longer illustrated the past. It was the history - the anecdotes about Capa during the Spanish Civil War or Hemmingway during D-Day - which now served the present. Ophuls has made a film about the seige of Sarajevo, the place where he discovered censorship is a simple matter of shooting journalists in the street. From it he has drawn his lessons about the life and death of truth in the line of fire.<p><center><img height=2 width=520 src="ophuls_pix/troubles_line.gif"></center><p><img align=left height=120 width=197 hspace=12 vspace=8 src="ophuls_pix/inn.gif">Ophuls visited Sarajevo five times during 1993 and much of what has eventually become the two films takes place in the city's Holiday Inn. He accompanies the <b>BBC's John Simpson,</b> the <b>New York Times' John Burns</b> and <b>FR2's Stephane Manier</b> on their sorties through the city and into the hills beyond. There are charged encounters with others within the hotel itself - with <b>Paul Marchand, a French radio journalist</b> who despises the armoured-car safety of his colleagues and with <b>Marine Laroche-Joubert</b> who is bitterly critical of French newscasters safe in their studios and earning five times as much<img align=right height=140 width=196 hspace=12 vspace=8 src="ophuls_pix/burns.gif"> as she does. And there are Ophuls' own forays into the city's life and death - the journalist crouching in the sniper-scarred wrek of the city's newspaper offices and the actor whose legs were blown away but who is confident he will again play Shakespeare. Ophuls even goes out of his way to interview <b>Serb president Slobodan Milosevic</b> and </b>Bosnian Serb Vice-President Nikola Koljevic.</b> There are, besides, conversations with <b>veteran war correspondent Martha Gellhorn</b> (who tells of stowing away on a D-Day boat but having her material scooped by Ernest Hemmingway) and with editors, cameramen, photographers and reporters who covered conflicts in Palestine, the Gulf and elsewhere.<br clear=right><p><center><img height=2 width=520 src="ophuls_pix/troubles_line.gif"></center><p><img align=left height=137 width=199 hspace=12 vspace=8 src="ophuls_pix/laughing.gif">But the heart of these films is a restless odyssey in the bitter Sarajevo cold through the sharp moral conflicts which beset the coverage of war. Ophuls confronts the seriousness of the conflict by reflecting on the ironies he finds around himself. Are these men and women in it for fun? Does reporting make any difference? Doesn't it simply feed off itself - making the death of a journalist headline news while the daily suffering of everyone else is unnoticed? Isn't there something ridiculous about men and women at the heart of a terrible seige who find time to gripe about their pay? Can the suffering of war's victims be faithfully understood by professionals who wear flakjackets and ride amoured cars and who take a plane for Thailand when their duty is over?<p><center><img height=2 width=520 src="ophuls_pix/troubles_line.gif"></center><p>For Ophuls the Frenchman, the reporting of war is also a challenge to the integrity of the TV networks at home. With characteristically boyish humour he exposes the cosy relationship between French TV chiefs and politicians, the empty showmanship of new anchormen, the superficiality  of the Paris editors and the meanness of channels which pour cash into gameshows but who will not purchase any protection for crews in sniper alley.<p>Ophuls' sympathy in <i>The Troubles We've Seen </i> emerges from this kaleidoscope of experience. His anger is for those who gloss over suffering. His wit breaks out in absurd yet pointed quotations from the cinema in which his early years were spent. 'All God's Children Got Guns' sing the Marx brothers in one moment among many in this pair of films which could have come from no other <i>auteur.</i> But above all it is the generosity and the courage of the reporters in the Holiday Inn which stays in the mind. <p><center><img height=2 width=520 src="ophuls_pix/troubles_line.gif"></center><p><h2>Marcel Ophuls</h2> <img align=right height=135 width=150 hspace=8 vspace=8 src="ophuls_pix/marcel.gif">Marcel was born in Frankfurt in 1927, but his family fled the Nazis - in 1933 to Paris and in 1941 to the States. He returned to Paris in 1950 but has remained on the move ever since. His first work was in the cinema - once in <i>Lola Montes </i> as Assistant Director to his father Max. He has produced radio plays, worked as a news reporter and made documentaries in France, Germany and the States. His breakthrough came with <i>The Sorrow and the Pity, </i> seen around the world but only broadcast in France twelve years after its completion. It was followed by an account of the Troubles in Northern Ireland in the ealy 1970s and <i>The Memory of Justice </i> on the Nuremburg Trials. <i>Hotel Terminus </i> was made after his return to France in 1979 and was as much a film about Ophuls himself as about his subject, <b>Klaus Barbie.</b> It was described as uncompromising, laughing in the face of horror, outraged at the silence which covers the uprooted, the stateless and the innocent children.<br><br clear=left><center><img height=2 width=520 src="ophuls_pix/troubles_line.gif"></center><p><img align=left width=104 height=54 hspace=12 src="../owo_logos/online_logo_border.gif"> <a href="tv_current.html"> This week's TV</a><br>  <a href="radio_current.html"> This week's radio</a><br><a href="../index.html"> Home Page</a><br clear=left><br></body></html>

<center><h2>VSO Volunteers working for Peace and Reconstruction</h2></center>



VSO has programmes in countries including Cambodia, Eritrea, Guinea Bissau, Namibia, Nigeria, Uganda, Vietnam, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Belize, Sri Lanka, and in Eastern Europe.<p>




<b>Michael Craven is a Physiotherapist at the Cambodia Trust's Limb Fitting Centre in Kompong Som, Cambodia</b><p>




Each day Michael Craven is faced with the consequences of the 'killing fields' of Cambodia. There are an estimated 7 million landmines in Cambodia and injuries from land mine explosions result in 250 amputations every month. Michael Craven works with rural communities, fitting landmine victims with artificial limbs so that they can generate income by returning to farm their land.<p>




The aim is to get these people back to work so their families don't suffer.  Treatment at the Cambodia Trust's Limb Fitting Centre gives them a chance to earn a living for their families and lead normal, active lives.<p>




An important part of Michael Craven's work is setting up an outreach programme for the centre and training local outreach workers to run the programme. Persuading patients fitted with artificial limbs to return for regular 6-monthly checks is difficult, and the outreach programme encourages these checks.  It particularly targets women and children who, finding it more difficult to visit the town clinic, often remain untreated in their villages.<p>




<b>Catherine Lillington is an English Teacher working at the Khemera Project in Cambodia.</b><p>




Khemera helps Cambodian women to take responsibility for their future. Members of this women's group work together to realise their potential and play a full role in national development.  Established four years ago, Khemera is developing a credit programme, setting up child-care centres and training village women in leadership skills.<p>




For the Khmer-speaking women of Khemera, Cambodia's first local non-governmental organisation, learning English is about empowerment. Catherine Lillington's lessons allows access to local training courses and enables them to communicate with potential funders. <p>




Command of English enables the women to lobby for political advantage and financial support, and the work of VSO volunteers has allowed the group's Deputy-Director to represent and talk about Khemera's work overseas. This will allow Khemera, in collaboration with other NGOs, to play a strong role in advocating protection of human rights and promotion of democracy in Cambodia. <p>
 



<b>Matthew Agnew is a carpentry instructor at Mai Habar Vocational Training Centre in Eritrea</b><p>




After a devastating 30-year civil war, the people of Eritrea are determined to regenerate their country.  But for whole generations of Eritreans the only formal education was being taught how to fight.  Now there is a strong government commitment to regain lost technical skills.<p>




Mai Habar, an old army base, has been turned into a training college for disabled ex-fighters, and VSO technical instructors like Matthew are helping them become economically active and independent.  The college also aims to recruit other disadvantaged groups, including war widows and former refugees returning from neighbouring Ethiopia.<p>




<b>Monica Golding is a Mini-league sports coach in South Africa</b><p>




Sports development is an exciting new initiative for VSO, and Monica is the second of six sports volunteers to be posted to South Africa this year.  Mini-League is a team ballsport similar to mini-rugby which has been specially adapted to township life, and Monica coaches children aged 5-13 in Alexandra, a township outside Johannesburg.  <p>




The game can be played with teams of different sizes, abilities and ages, and the need for space and equipment is minimal.  The aim of the scheme is to give more people in the townships access to sports facilities, offering a sense of direction and commmitment to young people in the poorest parts of the country.<p>

<P>
Texte int&eacute;gral d'un article paru dans<I> Lom&eacute; 2000</I>,
no. 2, mai 1996: page 3</CENTER> <HR>
<P>

<P>

Bien que la Conf&eacute;rence intergouvernementale (CIG) sur la
r&eacute;vision du Trait&eacute; de Maastricht n'aborde pas la
coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement en tant que telle,
la communaut&eacute; des ONG en Europe est d&eacute;termin&eacute;e
&agrave; influencer les discussions de la CIG de mani&egrave;re
&agrave; ce que ses valeurs et principes soient refl&eacute;t&eacute;s
dans la politique &eacute;trang&egrave;re et de s&eacute;curit&eacute;
commune de l'UE.
<P>
Les 19 et 20 avril derniers, les participants &agrave; la conf&eacute;rence
annuelle du CL-ONGD sur &quot;la CIG et une Europe ouverte sur
le monde&quot; se sont pench&eacute;s sur la coh&eacute;rence
des politiques europ&eacute;ennes touchant les pays en d&eacute;veloppement.
<P>
Trois grandes questions ont &eacute;t&eacute; abord&eacute;es:
quelles sont les incoh&eacute;rences des politiques europ&eacute;ennes,
quelle est leur origine et que faire pour les surmonter? Trois
domaines-cl&eacute;s ont &eacute;t&eacute; identifi&eacute;s:
la politique &eacute;trang&egrave;re et de s&eacute;curit&eacute;
commune, la politique d'immigration et de citoyennet&eacute;,
et les politiques communes (notamment commerciale et agricole)
qui semblent &quot;donner d'une main et prendre de l'autre&quot;.
<P>
De l'avis des participants, les incoh&eacute;rences proviennent
principalement d'un conflit d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts entre diff&eacute;rents
groupes europ&eacute;ens, notamment au sein de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
civile (consommateurs, agro-industrie). L'id&eacute;e que l'UE
doit respecter les objectifs qu'elle s'est fix&eacute;s et promouvoir
les valeurs de s&eacute;curit&eacute; humaine se retrouvait &eacute;galement
au coeur des discussions sur l'avenir de l'aide europ&eacute;enne
men&eacute;es par les ONG, &agrave; Londres et Helsinki.
<P>
La plateforme britannique du Comit&eacute; de liaison ONGD-UE
a organis&eacute; une conf&eacute;rence intitul&eacute;e &quot;Lost
Horizons? The future of Europe's Relations with the South&quot;
qui fut l'occasion pour les repr&eacute;sentants de la Commission,
du gouvernement britannique et du Parlement europ&eacute;en de
s'exprimer sur l'orientation future de l'aide communautaire. Les
opinions ont diverg&eacute; sur certains points pr&eacute;occupant
les ONG, tels que la priorit&eacute; aux pays les plus pauvres,
la r&eacute;orientation des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts de l'UE, et
l'aide aux pays voisins. Les participants ont &eacute;voqu&eacute;
en outre la CIG, l'avenir de Lom&eacute; et la situation des pays
les moins avanc&eacute;s dans le syst&egrave;me mondial des &eacute;changes.
<P>
En d&eacute;pit de leur arriv&eacute;e r&eacute;cente sur la sc&egrave;ne
de Lom&eacute;, les remarques critiques des ONG finlandaises constituent
un apport pr&eacute;cieux au processus actuel de r&eacute;flexion.

</center></h5>
<hr>

Post-independence development strategies gave the state a lead role in managing development,
often at the exclusion of other actors in society. This led the public sector to expand well beyond
its managerial and financial possibilities. During the 1980's, a global consensus
emerged on the limits to what the public sector can achieve in promoting growth and development.
The new neo-liberal doctrine emphasized adjustment, deregulation, and privatisation. Particularly in
sub-Saharan Africa, attacks were launched on the developmental state. Structural adjustment
programmes challenged the state's monopoly on power and the African state, formerly the exclusive recipient, partner and rationale for international aid, lost its most favoured status. These changes created space for other actors in development and contributed
to the drive towards democratisation processes. At the same time, the concept of "good governance" became the new buzzword.
<p>
In recent years, the overall thrust of this new development orthodoxy has been challenged. Four
main reasons can be identified for this. First, simply "rolling back the state" proved to be no
panacea. Policies introduced to reduce the size and cost of the civil service, for instance, led to a
dramatic erosion in wage levels, such that the public sector could no longer attract and retain
qualified staff. As a result, capacity often shrank to dangerously low levels. 
<p>
Second, the long-running "state-versus-market" debate lost much of its poignancy. Indiscriminate
privatization and dismantling of the state was perceived to be as much an error as the earlier whole-cloth commitment to centralist-bureaucratic organization.
Experience in East Asia highlights the critical role of a strong and efficient government, and a "combat-ready" African public administration system is considered to require clarity of role and scope as well as ability to determine optimal levels of involvement.
 <p>
Third, research indicates that links between democratisation and development remain haphazard. Developing countries that have been successful in pursuing
growth and alleviating poverty are generally those whose politics have concentrated sufficient power, probity, autonomy and competence at the centre to shape, pursue and encourage the achievement of explicit and nationally-determined development objectives. 
<p>
Fourth, the limitations of "civil society" actors as development agents are increasingly recognised.
In gerenal, civil society actors, including NGO's, are still very weak in organizational terms and
doubts have been raised as to their capacity to have significant impact on political reform. In many cases, the division between state and civil society is not obvious,
and there is an awareness that a multitude of civil society organizations, operating outside national policy frameworks, will yield few results in their efforts to treat the development problems of Africa.
<p>
While there are very few defenders of the highly centralised bureaucratic state, the pendulum may
have swung too far in reducing the scope of action of the public sector. The key challenge now is
to ensure the transition from a role in which [governments] dominated the development policy
process to one in which they provide an enabling environment for a variety of relatively autonomous institutional actors.
<p>
This paper provides a concrete example of one such transition process in managing development
cooperation resources. Decentralised cooperation was one of the innovations of the fourth Lom&#233; Convention signed in 1989 between the European Union (EU) and 69 ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) states. It makes a wide variety of development actors eligible to use Lom&#233; resources which, in the past, were the monopoly of central government agencies. This innovation reflected changing
(donor) perceptions on the state-society relationship and development cooperation modalities. Yet
putting the concept into practice has proven difficult, and the results of decentralised cooperation under Lom&#233; IV have, so far, been dismal.

Would you end up in jailor could you look forward to a nice little villa in the sun? This look atthe current whereabouts of the world's most notorious former dictators mayhelp you make your decision.</font><p><hr width=71%><p><center><img width=263 height=23 hspace=10 vspace=10 src="where_crazy.gif"></center><br clear=all><h3>POL POT</h3><b>THEN</b> - Born Saloth Sar, he has preferred since his<BR>student days to be known as Pol Pot, which means 'Original Cambodian'. Whenhe rose to power as head of the Khmer Rouge in 1975, he saw himself as granddesigner of a new society. The rare photo above shows a smiling father-figureleading his people into the promised land of an enforced agricultural lifestyle.Virtually all educated people were liquidated and 1.5 million people perishedin this holocaust before the Khmer Rouge were ousted by Vietnam's invasionin 1979.<p><b>NOW</b> - Pol Pot stays in the background because of his 'unfortunate'international reputation but he is still leader of the Khmer Rouge, whichholds large areas of western Cambodia by force of terror. He could yet returnto power in Phnom Penh.<p><h3>JEAN BEDEL BOKASSA</h3><b>THEN</b> - Bokassa served in the French Army for 22 years before seizingpower in the Central African Republic in 1965. He suffered from delusionsof grandeur that culminated when he crowned himself emperor in 1977 in aceremony costing $28 million. In 1979 100 students demonstrated againsta law requiring them to buy their uniforms in stores owned by the Emperor- and were tortured and killed under his personal supervision. Laterthat year France could bear his eccentricities no more and deposed him.<p><b>NOW</b> - Bokassa took refuge in France. But he was so homesick that hereturned home in 1986, where he was tried and found guilty of cannibalism,murder and misappropriating $170 million of public funds. His death sentencewas commuted to life imprisonment and he was then released in a generalamnesty in September 1993. While in prison Bokassa came up with a delusionof a different kind - he now declares himself to be the thirteenthApostle of Christ. He lives alone in a small three-bedroom house in thecapital, Bangui. <p><h3>AUGUSTO PINOCHET</h3><b>THEN</b> - Backed by the CIA and the multinational corporation ITT, GeneralPinochet led the coup that deposed and killed socialist President Allendein 1973. The military dictatorship that Pinochet then oversaw used tortureand extrajudicial execution to maintain its hold while using Chile as alaboratory for the world's first major experiment with monetarism.<p><b>NOW</b> -  In 1988 a plebiscite refused to extend Pinochet's rule.  So he altered the constitution to reduce the powers of the incoming elected President - and left himself head of the armed forces. All the other South American dictators are gone but Pinochet has found the perfect solution: Chile now has the squeaky-clean sheen of democracy yet he still has his finger on the trigger.<p><center><img width=234 height=24 hspace=10 vspace=10 src="where_exile.gif"></center><br clear=all><h3>ALFREDO STROESSNOR</h3><b>THEN</b> - General Stroessner seized power in Paraguay in 1954. Of Germandescent, he was a great admirer of Nazism: this showed not only in the refugehe offered to war criminals but also in his ruthless methods. His idea ofopposition parties was to appoint their leaders himself. But democratizationelsewhere in Latin America in the mid-1980s helped strengthen popular organizationand he was finally deposed on 3 February 1989.<p><b>NOW</b> -  Stroessner took refuge in Brazil, where he still enjoys a quietbut very comfortable retirement in a mansion in the capital, Brasilia. Now83, he still feels the need of a heavy guard around his house - butold soldiers are used to that. He frequently visits former military comradesto reminisce about the good old days when Brazil was also a dictatorshipand gave him its highest military honour. He is fond of fishing - andis a devoted fan of Xuxa, a Barbie- doll lookalike celebrity who hosts children'sTV.<p><h3>MENGISTU HAILE MARIAM</h3><b>THEN</b> - Colonel Mengistu assumed control in 1977 of the military governmentthat had dethroned Ethiopia's Emperor Haile Selassie three years earlier.He was backed by the Soviet Union and followed Stalin's lead in establishinga one-party state and waging all-out war on separatist movements which threatenedthe 'unity' of the country (and the supremacy of Mengistu's own Amharicpeople). He was hoist by his own petard, beaten in battle by the Eritreansand Tigrayans.<p><b>NOW</b> -  Mengistu fled to Harare in 1991, where he has been hosted insome style. But he has run into trouble over his phone bills, which areaveraging $4,600 a month and are paid by the Zimbabwean Government. Hishosts' patience snapped recently when Mengistu urged Ethiopians to riseup against their new government - with which Zimbabwe has full diplomaticrelations. Foreign Minister Nathan Shamyarira told him to shut up. Mengistushould take care in case they extradite him - he is currently on trial inabsentia in Addis Ababa for 'crimes against humanity'.<p><h3>RAOUL CEDRAS</h3><b>THEN</b> - General Cedras seized power in Haiti in 1991 after the electionof Jean-Bertrand Aristide. He ruled with the rod of iron associated withHaiti's infamous former dictators, the Duvaliers (see 'Baby Doc', page 14):there were at least 4,000 political assassinations and more than 40,000fled the country in boats for the US. He fled into exile in  September 1994when the US sent an invasion force under the banner of the UN.<p><b>NOW</b> -  Cedras is now in Panama, the only rival to France as the favouritehaven for former dictators - Juan Domingo Peron of Argentina and theShah of Iran once took refuge there, and Guatemala's Jorge Serrano is agreat success as a racehorse owner. Cedras has a penthouse suite in a buildingcalled 'The Emperor' in Panama City's wealthy Punta Paitilla area wherehe jogs each morning on the seafront and where neighbours say they are surprised'how nice he is'. He is not short of cash: the US State Department alonepays him $5,000 a month in rent for his properties in Haiti. Panama UniversityProfessor Miguel Antonio Bernal complains: 'Our country is being used asa wastebasket for the political toxic waste of the world.'<p><h3>IDI AMIN DADA</h3><b>THEN</b> - Amin was probably the most notorious of all Africa's post-independencedictators. His larger-than-life build (he was Uganda's heavyweight boxingchampion between 1951 and 1960) and addiction to fatuous pronouncementsmade him a laughing stock in some quarters of the West in the 1970s. Buthe was no joke at home - particularly for the 50,000 Asians who wereexpelled from the country in 1972 or for Jewish people whose land and propertyhe seized in one of his fits of explicitly Hitlerite antisemitism. <p><b>NOW</b> -  Deposed by an invading Tanzanian army in 1979, Amin and histwo wives fled to Saudi Arabia, where he initially cost his hosts, the SaudiRoyal family, around $2,000 a day. He now lives a quiet life in a modestvilla outside Jeddah, looking after his goats and chickens and cultivatinghis vegetable garden. Traditional Arab garb has replaced the bemedalledField Marshal's uniform of his heyday. And his social highlight is meetingother Ugandan exiles for coffee in one of Jeddah's main hotels.<p><center><img width=199 height=26 hspace=10 vspace=10 src="where_uppers.gif"></center><br clear=all><h3>JEAN-CLAUDE DUVALIER - 'BABY DOC'</h3> <b>THEN</b> - Fran&ccedil;ois 'Papa Doc' Duvalier ruled Haiti with an ironhand between 1957 and 1971 - with US backing. On his death he passedhis title of 'President-for-life' to his son Jean-Claude, by which timeHaiti had become the poorest country in the Americas. Baby Doc faced moreopposition at home and abroad than his father but ruled for even longerby the same means - savage repression. By the time he was ousted in1986 it was estimated that his regime had been responsible for 40,000 murders.<p><b>NOW</b> - Baby Doc was offered 'temporary asylum' by France, a long-timeprop to his regime - he is still there now. He set up house with hiswife Mich&egrave;le and their son in a palatial home on the Riviera, havingcarried out of Haiti a substantial chunk of a fortune once estimated at$400 million. But life is not quite so sweet now. In 1992 his wife divorcedhim, taking a goodly slice of his cash (her own tastes are notoriously expensive).Since then Baby Doc has spent what was left of his hoard - he is livingnow in a seedy, poorly maintained villa in Mougins with his mother. In 1994his telephone was cut off because he hadn't paid his bill. Tragic, really.<p><h3>MANUEL NORIEGA</h3><b>THEN</b> - General Noriega became commander-in-chief of the National Guardin Panama in 1983 and for the next six years was more powerful than thePresident. He was the kind of ruthless leader the US favoured in the restof Central America and was even on the CIA payroll. But he fell foul ofthe US when he failed to support their plan to invade Nicaragua - theywithdrew aid and imposed sanctions.  The US invaded Panama with 26,000 troopson 20 December 1989: more than 4,000 Panamanians were killed and Noriegawas taken prisoner.<p><b>NOW </b>-  Noriega stood trial in Miami on charges of drug traffickingand was sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment. He is still in a Florida jailcontemplating the irony that he was once also the proteg&eacute; of theUS Drug Enforcement Agency. Meanwhile the legal office of the Presidentthe US installed in his place was discovered to have connections with 14companies that had laundered drug money.<p><center><img width=160 height=25 hspace=10 vspace=10 src="where_home.gif"></center><br clear=all><h3>IMELDA MARCOS</h3><b>THEN</b> - Singer Imelda Romualdez married Philippine dictator FerdinandMarcos and enjoyed a famously luxurious lifestyle: the Marcoses salted awaybillions of dollars in the course of their US-backed rule between 1965 and1986. Imelda enjoyed the exercise of power too: she was Governor of MetroManila from 1975 onwards and also, bizarrely, Minister of Ecology. Whenthe couple were eventually deposed by 'people power', invaders of the PresidentialPalace came across Imelda's phantasmagoric collection of designer footwear.<p><b>NOW</b> -  The Marcoses went into exile in Hawaii, where Ferdinand diedin 1989. Imelda returned to the Philippines in 1991 and stood unsuccessfullyin the Presidential elections of 1992. In 1993 she was sentenced to 18 years'imprisonment for criminal graft and to other long sentences for corruption. She is still free while she appeals and was elected to Congress in May 1995. Meanwhile, in its attempts to recover the lost Marcos billions from Swiss bank accounts and other shadier locations the Philippines Government has, after paying its US lawyers, recovered the princely sum of $2,000.<p><BR><BR><HR>&copy;Copyright: New Internationalist 1996 <HR><A HREF="../index.html"><IMG SRC="../ni_pix/nilogo3.gif" "HSPACE=2" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="30" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom>NI Home Page</A> <A HREF="../issue275/contents.html"><IMG SRC="../issue275/cover275_thumb.gif" "HPSPACE=2" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="57" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom>Issue 275 Contents</A> <HR></BODY></HTML>

Every threeor four issues there seemed to be something maverick in the magazine's treatment that varied the pace of a subscription and offered a different way intoa subject.<p>It was only when I joined the staff that I found those maverick treatmentshad often emerged out of desperation as a small co-operative with limitedresources coped with the demands of producing an international magazine of quality every month.<p>The operation is not run so much by the seat of the pants these days andmaybe some of that ragged, raw unpredictability has gone. Good riddance,you might well think. But we still value a treatment that puts a differenttwist on a subject and thereby opens a few doors that would otherwise remainshut.<p><img width=80 height=114 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 border=1 src="editor.jpg">This is why we have chosen to base this issue on a fiction - that aWorld People's Court has been established without the major powers managing to scupper it in advance, and that a prosecution team is about to bring cases against five important public figures around the world for their various 'crimes against humanity'. The crimes outlined, though - and the damage done to the ordinary people on the other end of them - are very real.<p>We do not witness their trial. Instead the dossier that the prosecutionteam has compiled is opened to our gaze, including not just the charges,the anticipated defence and the requested sentence but also the meditations of the Chief Prosecutor on how the case should be played.<p>You might justifiably feel that these five people are by no means the world's worst 'fugitives from justice' and that there are plenty of brutal dictators still polluting the world who deserve to be put in the dock. This is perfectly true - and the Facts spread on Page 18 breaks down the human-rights record of what we consider to be the ten worst dictatorships in the world, while on Page 12 you will find out what many of the most infamous dictators from the recent past are up to now. But if the case against Saddam Hussein had been followed by a litany of the crimes of General Abacha of Nigeriathe magazine would surely have become repetitive as well as thoroughly depressing.<p>So we have selected a slightly less obvious quintet. I would dearly liketo have included a sixth who would have been less obvious still: ProfessorJeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economist who has acted as a consultant exporting free-market shock therapy to both Latin America and Eastern Europe. But the case against him didn't quite gel in the time we had available. Maybe next time - any dirt you have on the dear professor may be dished to this address.<p><ul><ul><img width=153 height=48 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 src="editor_signature.gif"></ul></ul><br clear=all><p><b>Chris Brazier</b><BR>for the <b>New Internationalist</b> Co-operative<p><HR>&copy;Copyright: New Internationalist 1996 <HR><A HREF="../index.html"><IMG SRC="../ni_pix/nilogo3.gif" "HSPACE=2" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="30" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom>NI Home Page</A> <A HREF="../issue275/contents.html"><IMG SRC="../issue275/cover275_thumb.gif" "HPSPACE=2" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="57" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom>Issue 275 Contents</A> <HR></BODY></HTML>

Nobody left but me. The storm that's beenslapping the mountains about for hours is now whipping over the waters of Lake Geneva to give the glass beside me a hard time. I'm safe. It can'ttouch me. But what about the storm I'll walk into tomorrow? After all mycomfortable years of cynicism, can I really make a fist of this new roleas Crusading Knight representing the Downtrodden Masses of the World? <p>I thought I'd left all that crusading business behind a long, long timeago in that other world called the Sixties. All of us wanted to change theworld, we just chose different ways to do it. I had a friend who blew upa power plant in protest at the military-industrial complex during the VietnamWar. Others wound up with their great earthmoving novel degraded into onelinersand soundbites for ad agencies. And still others just got married and startedpouring all their dreams into their kids.<BR>Me? I went to law school, on fire with the notion that the law was all aboutjustice. Ten years later there I was like any other lawyer, busily prosecutingthe weak and the disenfranchised - crucifying them for getting involvedin violence or theft in ghetto areas where they more or less had no option.Or, worse still, putting people in prison because they couldn't pay thefines imposed on them for some trivial offence - punishment for beingpoor.<BR><BR>Call me a coward or a sell-out but my reaction wasn't to put my legal skillsat the service of those same poor people, working in some community lawcentre with wet rot in the walls and warm compassion in the coffee cups.Instead I looked after myself: I went for prestige cases with prestige feesattached and sneered at the system on the quiet as if that put me aboveit. I built myself a name as well as a fancy house.<BR><BR>Maybe membership of the country-club set was what did it for me in the end- all those fine, upstanding citizens with the gall to assume I sharedtheir smug, bigoted ideas about crime and punishment, their enthusiasm forcleaning up the streets with a flamethrower. They'd rant on about the pushersand the pimps, the communists and the common riff-raff who were gettingaway with murder. And in the next breath they'd tell you about their latestscam for tax evasion without even the decency to wonder whether broadcastingit to a lawyer might not be a very smart move. The criminals we most needto catch don't even get called criminals.<BR><BR>There had to be something better. I used my connections and got myself alegal job inside the UN. I wish I could say that cured me of my cynicism.But it did the trick for me in one sense - without that experiencethere's no way I would have got this job as the first Chief Prosecutor atthe World People's Court. <BR><BR>And this is my last chance for redemption: deep down I know that I'm desperatefor this to work out, to prove myself wrong and be reunited with all thoseold ideals. I look at the team that's working for me on these first fivecases and their faith that we can bring this off is almost painful to me.Painful because they remind me of my younger, better self but also becauseI know there's next to no chance that these prosecutions will succeed. TheWorld People's Court was a crazy bolt from the blue, an idea about a hundredyears ahead of its time which was pushed through by the Scandinavians whilethe major powers were looking the other way. But once it was in place therewas no way the big wheels were going to let it threaten their own globalcountry club.<BR><BR>I know that when my bosses ordered me not to go for the world's worst dictators- General Abacha of Nigeria, for example, or General Suharto of Indonesia- they had a not-so-hidden agenda. They say that those people are beingdealt with by 'other channels'. But the real reason is that the crimes ofthe Mobutus of this world are so nakedly evident that we'd have had no troublemaking our case stick. <BR><BR>Instead they gave me free rein to come up with prosecutions against a secondtier of individuals who are less accepted as criminals by the world community.They were more or less inviting me to pluck out people like Jacques Chiracor the Pope, people so powerful that I have no chance of bringing them down.I'll tilt at windmills and the Court will lose its credibility. They knowI know this. But we also both know that the Court already has a life ofits own - its own brief leaves it no option but to take on the powerfuland to hang itself by its own rope in the process.<BR><BR>Or is this just the old cynicism creaking in my bones again?<BR><BR>The storm's given out. I wish this was like some cheap novel where the changein the weather reflects the protagonist's change in mood.

He rose through theranks to become Nestl&eacute;'s head of operations in Germany and becamechief executive of the whole company in 1982.<p><hr width=61%><p><font size=+1><b>PROSECUTOR'S NOTES TO THE TEAM:</b></font><br><i>'Why go for Maucher?' some of you have been asking. 'Surely it's Nestl&eacute;as a company which should be in the dock?' Of course it is really Nestl&eacute;- the largest food company in the world - we're putting on trial.But in a world in which it is more and more difficult for governments tocall multinational corporations  to account, it is vital we establish theprecedent that a chief executive can be put on trial for the wrongdoingsof his (always 'his', I'm afraid) company. It stands to reason that managersare going to think longer and harder before taking an unethical decisionif they know they might be personally prosecuted for it.<p>Considering the world of corporate sharks he now inhabits, it's really rathercharming that Maucher is the archetypal one-company man.  He's given hiswhole working life to Nestl&eacute;. By the late 1970s Nestl&eacute; wasin dreary decline and at its nadir in 1980 it earned less than it had nineyears earlier. Staff levels at head-office were bloated and  inefficient:three levels of management approval were  required just to issue a pressrelease. Maucher at that time mocked the futuristic glass-and-chrome HQon the banks of Lake Geneva as 'the Vatican'.  On that basis in 1982 hebecame Pope and very quickly turned the whole company round - there'sno doubting the guy's ability. <p>He's an extrovert who wears saddle shoes and whose ties always carry theNestl&eacute; insignia. He loves aphorisms and is fond of exhorting histroops with the line: 'Let's have more pepper and less paper'. Lucky hedidn't make a career as a stand-up comedian...  But he did come up witha line that wasn't half bad about Nestl&eacute;'s lack of winning chocolatebars until they swallowed up Rowntree in 1988: 'In chocolate Nestl&eacute;missed the part of the world that belongs to Coca-Cola and rock'n'roll.'</i><p><hr width=61%><p><font size=+1><b>CHARGES: </b></font><br>	<b>Aggressively pursuing sales of artificial babyfood  - and so endangeringthe lives of children in developing countries.</b> Babies given formula milkinstead of breastmilk are in grave danger in the Majority World not leastbecause of the difficulty of guaranteeing the safety of water supplies withwhich to mix the powder. Babies all too often contract diarrhoea, whichis the single biggest killer of children worldwide. According to UNICEFone and a half million babies die every year because they are not breastfed.<p><img width=175 height=290 align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 src="twins.jpg"><br><b>These babies are twins. Their Pakistani mother was wrongly advised that she would not have enough breastmilk to feed both and so bottlefed her daughter while breastfeeding her son. The girl died the day after this photo was taken in Islamabad Children's Hospital. 'Use my picture, ' said the mother, 'if it will help others not to make the same mistake.'</b><br>(photo, right)<p><font size=+1><b>PROSECUTOR'S NOTES:</b></font><br>	<i>The way Maucher has played the babyfoods issue is instructive. Until hetook over, Nestl&eacute; was trying to face down the international boycottwhich New Internationalist magazine helped launch in 1974. The vice-presidentresponsible at the time was one Ernest Saunders, later to be imprisonedfor fraud while chief executive of the Guinness corporation. He handledit badly. Maucher, in contrast, seemed very amenable at first, full of assurancesabout Nestl&eacute;'s willingness to comply with critics. He so won peopleover that the boycott was called off in 1984 - only to be restartedin 1988 when it became clear Nestl&eacute; was reneging on many of its promises.But that not only gained the company four years, it also meant the boycotthad to gather momentum from scratch. There's no question - he's a smoothoperator.</i><p>	Repeated breaches of the 1981 World Health Organization International Codeof Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes. This proposes strict controls onthe activities of manufacturers and calls for a ban on all promotion ofbreastmilk substitutes. The International Baby Food Action Network publication<i>Breaking the Rules 1994 </i>detailed hundreds of allegations against Nestl&eacute;for breaching the International Code:<BR><li>In 133 cases Nestl&eacute; admits having carried out no investigation<BR><li>In 91 cases of babymilk promotion and 64 cases of babyfood promotion,Nestl&eacute; admits the practices but tries to justify them<BR><li>In 5 cases Nestl&eacute; claims that the allegations refer to old<BR>	promotional material (which is nevertheless still being distributed andused)<BR><li>In only 3 cases Nestl&eacute; admits the violation - but claims tohave changed.<p>	<i>What really gets my goat is Nestle's consistent promotion of itself as a caring, nurturing organization concerned about child health. The Annual Report for 1993, for example, is full of such smugness, talking about the company symbol of the mother bird feeding its babies in the nest. This 'personifies the business' , it says. 'The symbol, which is universally understood, simultaneously evokes security, maternity and affection, nature and nourishment, family and tradition. Today it is the central element in Nestle's corporate identity.' <p>Contrast this with Maucher's words from 1987: 'We might say, somewhat provocatively, that in terms of its results for the human race, this economic system is ethical in and of itself and that businessmen (sic) who give and do their best in conformity with the system are by that very fact also acting morally and ethically from an objective point of view.' While in November 1995, Nestle spokesperson Thad Jackson told a US conference  on business ethics in a global economy of  'the necessity of looking at ethical issues outside of Western philosophy'. Another speaker at the Nestle-sponsored conference was even more explicit: 'In many (if not all) emerging markets it is simply impossible to make money without overt violation of normal Western ethical principles.' Nature and nourishment indeedÉ</i><p>	<b>Lobbying to keep national legislation on breastmilk substitutes weak.</b> Although over 70 governments have now taken action to stop free or low-cost supplies to healthcare facilities, only 11 or so countries have laws which cover the whole range of activities covered by the Code. In the 1980s Nestle and other babyfood companies opposed strong national legislation, advocating 'voluntary agreements'. Yet Nestle now excuses its own actions by saying governments have not legislated against them - and in countries such as Pakistan, Ghana and the Philippines it has lobbied governments to weaken legislation. In Chile, for example, Nestle continues to give out free supplies in contravention of the International Code, excusing the practice by saying there is no local law against doing so.<p>	<i>In reality what Nestle is about, like any other multinational, is maximizing its own profits. To that end it is keener than it has ever been to exploit the growing markets in the Majority World, especially in Asia. That's why they won't let infant feeding go and concentrate on chocolate instead. Maucher showed where he's really at when talking to shareholders in Lausanne in June 1995. 'The figures are clear: Asia will, within a few years, contribute about 50 per cent to [Nestle's] global gross product growth while Europe's contribution will not be higher than about 11 per cent. We are already firmly anchored in Asia and today - through geographic extension and through the diversification of our product range - we are broadening the base of our global presence. This allows us to benefit from population growth and from the increase in purchasing powerÉ' </i><p>    	<font size=+1><b>ANTICIPATED DEFENCE  </b></font><br>                          'In spite of the fact that infant-formula sales in developing countries represent only one per cent of Nestle's global turnover, the Company firmly believes it would be wrong to abandon these products as a result of what it considers to be misguided attacks. Infant formula is an absolute necessity, since it is the best possible alternative for mothers who cannot, or decide not to, breastfeed their babies. It is therefore the Company's responsibility to continue marketing infant formula.'<br>	<ul>Helmut Maucher, April 1992</ul><p>	<i>I think on some level Maucher really does believe this. He thinks people are criticizing Nestle just for the sake of it now. In fact the International Code does not call for Nestle to abandon babymilk - only for them to stop promoting it. In court Maucher will be a model of reasonableness, representing his critics as extremists with a vested interest in keeping a dead issue alive. And he will be very convincing. Be sure to keep your cool when you cross-examine him or you'll have lost the battle before it's even begun.</i><p>	<font size=+1><b>REQUESTED SENTENCE</b></font><br>Five years' imprisonment, suspended for five years. Any breach of the International Code in that period would activate the sentence.<p>	<i>As usual, we might privately prefer a more creative sentence. I'd go for five years  in a slum district of Manila trying to keep his grandchildren alive by feeding them Nestle milk powder diluted with local water - if it wasn't for the implications of that for the grandchildren.</i><p><hr width=71%><p><center><img width=178 height=126 hspace=10 vspace=10 src="witnesses_title.jpg"></center><br clear=all><img width=175 height=232 align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 src="jesus.jpg"><p><b>A Nestle ad from 1935. The caption translates as 'Nestle motherhood as seen by Raphael.'</b><br>(picture, right)<p><font size=+1><b>Mike Aaronson,</b> Director-General of Save the Children UK</font><p>The concern now strongly felt by many, including Save the Children and UNICEF, is that the babymilk manufacturers are behaving in ways which undermine the consensus and circumvent and violate the Code despite public claims to the contrary. Their interests are clear, however, as the global babyfoods market is enormous and growing. Vigilance and collaboration is essential if women who wish to breastfeed their babies are to retain the choice to do so.<p>A current cause for concern is a report on the use of Nestle's formula Lactogen for infants in maternity hospitals in Kunming, Yunnan Province, China. The report was prepared by a Save the Children health-training adviser and staff of the Kunming Medical College. Based on data collected by hospital staff and the observation of trends in the city's hospitals, the report reveals a drop in breastfeeding and a large increase in the use of Lactogen due to the provision of free formula to mothers leaving hospital and the provision of formula to hospitals at less than the market price. <p>In Kunming at least, Save the Children believes that Nestle's actions have undermined the principles and aim of the International Code and all relevant resolutions. Save the Children has made these concerns known to Nestle and is pressing for a satisfactory response.(<i>A statement to the <b>NI</b></i>)<p><font size=+1><b>Rubina Gupta</b>, Bombay, India</font><p>Rubina Gupta has bottle-fed Nestle's Cerelac to her son, Ishrat, since he was two months old. She saw a picture of a bonny baby on a tin in a chemist and thought Cerelac would be good for Ishrat. But Rubina is illiterate. She couldn't read the instructions on the tin that said it was weaning food - only suitable for those over four months old. Trying her best for Ishrat has resulted in his being undernourished and prone to diarrhoea. With customers like Rubina does Nestle believe it has a responsibility to do more than just stay within the law? Nestle told 3D that in poor countries infant formula is mainly used by mothers who can afford it and use it correctly. <br>(<i>As reported by Yorkshire TV's 3D, 1995</i>)<p> <font size=+1><b>Dr Raj Anand,</b> Indian paediatrician </font><p><b><i>In 1992 India passed one of the world's strictest laws controlling the promotion and distribution of infant-food products.</i></b><p>All the [babyfood] companies are violating the Act. For example, see this [he holds up a tin of Nestle's Lactogen 1]. Now, Nestle says throughout the world that they like to follow the laws and they are following the laws especiallyin developing countries where the laws are elected. But now our law demandsthat there should be a prominent notice on the tin of babyfoods which shouldsay 'mother's milk is best for your baby', not only in English but alsoin Hindi in the script. But look here... they say 'breast milk is best'and it is in English, nothing in Hindi. So this is a definite violationof our Act.<p>Studies have shown that in developing countries like India a baby who isnot breastfed is 14 times more likely to die from diarrhoea, 4 times morelikely to die from pneumonia and 2.5 times more likely to die from otherinfectious diseases. A bottle is a passport to death for the majority ofour babies. <BR>(<i>From Yorkshire TV's 3D, 1995</i>)<p><font size=+1><b>Susan Cruz, </b>a health worker from Baguio City,  the Philippines</font><p>When I left the hospital, every service and product was itemized on thebill. I was charged for each cotton bud they used to clean my baby Chisan'seyes and for the single teaspoon of sugar put in the water they gave her.But the Nestl&eacute; milk they gave Chisan - against my wishes -was absolutely free.<BR>(<i>Susan Cruz's testimony from 1988 was one reason why the Nestl&eacute; boycottwas relaunched. The pressure of the new international campaign has led Nestl&eacute; and other companies to reducefree supplies. But promotion through free gifts continues by other means,as the next testimony shows.</i>)<p><font size=+1><b>Ines Av Fernandez,</b> Arugaan Women's Health Campaign, Quezon City, the Philippines</font><p><BR>We are furious with Nestl&eacute;'s latest aggression having received reportsfrom<BR>government doctors and non-governmental organizations in the provinces ofPampanga, Lucena, Quezon, Tacloban and Davao representing the three bigislands of Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. The alarming reports showed thatNestl&eacute; gave incentives of gifts and cash to community-based healthvolunteers called Barangay Health Workers (BHW) who help implement primaryhealthcare programs. Each trained BHW covers about 20 neighbours in theircommunity and Nestl&eacute; offers them gifts of umbrella, medical bag,T-shirts whenever they sell a discounted Nestogen infant formula to theirneighbors. The more Nestogen they sell, the bigger the incentives. Example:if a box full was sold, cash pesos will be paid. All these marketing tricksdestroy the spirit of voluntarism! <BR>In fact it corrupts the value of the grassroots concern to alleviate povertyand generate self-reliance and put health in the hands of the people. I'mat a loss for harsh enough words to describe our reactions to this...<BR><i>(Letter to the International  Babyfood Action Network)</i><p><font size=+1><b>Leah Margulies, </b>former legal adviser at UNICEF</font><p>The fact that Nestl&eacute; says that only three of the charges [made againstit by the International Babyfood Action Network] were accurate doesn't makeit so. <BR>For example, the IBFAN report included violations that I found in a hospitalin Bangkok which I monitored while I was legal adviser to the UNICEF BabyFriendly Hospital Initiative. Nestl&eacute;'s response was that these freesupplies were donated for the purposes of a scientific study and of courseNestl&eacute; didn't consider this among its three violations. <p>The reality is that I went to the ward, interviewed nurses, and was toldof the regular donations of Nestl&eacute; infant formula. When I asked forproof, I was given copies of invoices marked 'complimentary'. The invoicedidn't indicate that the donations were for a study, and neither did thenurses - they just told me about the regular visits and showed me wherethe donations were kept - in the wards, alongside of the donationsgiven by other companies.<BR><i>(Letter to an organizer of the 1995 Nestl&eacute;-sponsored conference onbusiness ethics)</i>	<BR><BR><BR><HR>&copy;Copyright: New Internationalist 1996 <HR><A HREF="../index.html"><IMG SRC="../ni_pix/nilogo3.gif" "HSPACE=2" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="30" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom>NI Home Page</A> <A HREF="../issue275/contents.html"><IMG SRC="../issue275/cover275_thumb.gif" "HPSPACE=2" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="57" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom>Issue 275 Contents</A> <HR></BODY></HTML>

So we should contemplate the best, too. <b>The Right Livelihood Award,</b> often called the Alternative Nobel Prize, is dedicated to recognizing some of the people working selflessly to change the world for the better. Here are the winners for 1995.</font><img align=right width=100 height=101 hspace=10 vspace=10 src="rla_logo.jpg"><h3>SERB CIVIC COUNCIL<br>(Bosnia)</h3>Created in March 1994 by Serbs loyal to the multi-ethnic democratic government in Sarajevo, the Serb Civic Council now has about 50,000 members - a third of all Serbs living in areas still controlled by the Bosnian Government. Its own vision of peace is based on the preservation of a democratic and sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina in which all citizens' rights and freedoms are guaranteed in accord with the highest international standards. Members have been targeted for assassination by snipers, not least because of their links with resistance leaders operating within the region controlled by Radovan Karadzic's Pale regime. The Serb Civic Council's president is Mirko Pejanovic. <p>British historian Adrian Hastings calls their work 'an outstanding contribution to the cause of humanity, a contribution fully comparable with that of those Germans who 50 years ago participated in the resistance to Nazism. It is, nevertheless, acontribution which the internationalcommunity has deliberately ignored, anxious as it is to explain the conflict - quite mistakenly - as a 'civil war' between Muslims and Serbs, when it is in fact a war between a democratic and legitimate government, backed by an overwhelming majority of its population, and a fascist and terrorist movement.'<img align=right width=100 height=101 hspace=10 vspace=10 src="rla_logo.jpg"><h3>HUNGARIAN FOUNDATION FOR SELF-RELIANCE/ ANDR&Aacute;S B&Iacute;RO<br>(Hungary)</h3>Andr&aacute;s B&iacute;ro founded the Hungarian Foundation for Self-Reliance in 1990 to reinforce democratization by supporting initiatives on the environment and on minority rights (particularly those of the Roma or gypsy community), and by promoting civil society and grassroots democracy. The Foundation acts as a channel for voluntary aid from overseas, giving grants to grassroots organizations. But it is also leading an initiative to address the problems of the Roma in Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia as well as Hungary, concentrating on income-generating schemes - the Roma have been particularly badly hit by the ballooning unemployment which has followed the switch to the free market. The Foundation also awards a 'Tolerance Prize' each year for the best contribution to Hungarian ethnic harmony by a journalist or broadcaster.<p><img align=right width=100 height=101 hspace=10 vspace=10 src="rla_logo.jpg"><h3>SULAK SIVARAKSA<br>(Thailand)</h3>Sulak Sivaraksa has spent a lifetime working for human rights and democracy - and for an alternative development model to that of Western consumerism. He has played a leading role in the mobilization of civil society in Thailand, creating a string of social-welfare and development organizations, including a commission which trains Buddhist monks for development activism, and the Santi Pracha Dhamma Institute which promotes 'democratic ideals and practice through non-violent means'. Sivaraksa's consistent rejection of the Western development model in favour of a holistic, spiritually based alternative - one which is responsive to local cultures - has been of great influence worldwide. He has repeatedly incurred the wrath of the Thai Government, particularly in its military incarnations, and was forced into exile in 1991-92. He is currently working ontwo new initiatives: an international  'Alternatives to Consumerism' network and a new college in Thailand which will explore an alternative, more holistic approach to education.<p><img align=right width=100 height=101 hspace=10 vspace=10 src="rla_logo.jpg"><h3>CARMEL BUDIARDJO<br>(Indonesia/Britain)</h3>Carmel Budiardjo suffered three years' detention without trial before being forced to leave Indonesia in 1971. In 1973 she founded TAPOL, the Indonesia human-rights campaign and has run it ever since from its base in London, England. TAPOL has become the leading English-language source on Indonesian human-rights abuses (the word 'tapol' is a contraction of two Indonesian words meaning 'political prisoner'). Carmel was a major contributor to the NI issue on East Timor (March 1994).<p>According to the International Federation for East Timor, based in Japan: 'If today the tide of international opinion is turning with regard to the Suharto regime; if some of Indonesia's trade partners and economic aid donor countries are beginning to factor in democratization and human-rights protection in their relations with Jakarta; if Western arms sales to Indonesia are at last being seen in light of their true destructiveness: in no small measure this is due to the accumulated efforts for two decades of Carmel Budiardjo and TAPOL... A committed human-rights worker can make a difference. Carmel Budiardjo is proof of that.'	<p><BR><BR><HR>&copy;Copyright: New Internationalist 1996 <HR><A HREF="../index.html"><IMG SRC="../ni_pix/nilogo3.gif" "HSPACE=2" WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="30" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom>NI Home Page</A> <A HREF="../issue275/contents.html"><IMG SRC="../issue275/cover275_thumb.gif" "HPSPACE=2" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="57" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom>Issue 275 Contents</A> <HR></BODY></HTML>

<html><head><title>Amnestys' letter to the NGO Forum on women</title><!!keys: ></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#oooooo" link="#238e23" vlink="#4a766e"><img src="amnesty_pix/amnesty_logo.gif"><br><i>The material that follows has been provided by  <a href="amnesty.html">  Amnesty International</i></a><hr><h2>Letter from Amnesty International to the NGO Forum on Women 1 September 1995</h2><h3>Members of the Facilitating Committee<br>NGO Forum on Women</h3><font size=+1>Dear Members,</font><p>The NGO Forum at this World Conference on Women provides an historic opportunity for women from around the world to join together to achieve the goal of the conference -- Equality by the Year 2000.<p>The hopes and expectations of the activists at this conference are especially high since this is the first world conference on women in a decade, and as such offers a chance to dramatically change the situation of women as we enter the next century. <p>The debates and activities organized by the women's groups themselves will stimulate an important debate around the crucial issues facing women today. The caucus discussions around the Platform of Action will hopefully lead to a strong and clear demand from the Forum to the official conference on the action that is needed to improve the lives of women internationally. <p>As we enter the third day of the NGO Forum, however, there are still serious questions being raised and problems encountered by those attending the Forum. Until those questions are put to rest and the problems resolved, I fear that the real issues at the Forum will not get the attention they rightly deserve.<p>The first issue is the unhealthy atmosphere created at the Forum by the heavy security presence.<p>Conflicting messages continue to be sent to the organizations at the Forum: we have been told alternately that demonstrations are allowed only in the schoolyard in Huairou, that demonstrations are allowed anywhere in the Forum compound, and that regardless of where demonstrations are held they won't be allowed if they are deemed by the authorities to be "anti-China".<p>Other examples that Amnesty International and other delegates to the Forum have experienced include: workshops being monitored by security officials who take notes and photographs of participants and have attempted to confiscate workshop materials. These conditions at the Forum have been accompanied by some delegates being followed by security officials within the forum compound, and heavy and constant security presence and surveillance in hotels, which extends to participants not being allowed to receive guests. <p>This presence is often described as necessary to ensure the safety of participants at the Forum; however, the effect is not to create a sense of security but to instill a deep feeling of insecurity among Forum delegates. Our fear is that these intimidating tactics will not allow participants to exchange views freely and debate fully the issues that have brought them to this conference from around the world. And we have to ask - is this extreme level of security really necessary for a conference that can in no way threaten the security of the state. <p>The second issue is of access to the Forum. While we understand that it is not the role of the NGO Forum organizers to grant visas to participants, it is still astonishing that only 26,000 visas were apparently granted out of some 36,000 applicants. In the past few days leading up to the start of the Forum, we have heard many stories of participants being frustrated in their attempts to get visas and others simply not receiving them. <p>It is our view that the NGO Forum should seek and obtain from the Chinese authorities detailed explanations regarding those participants who were denied the right to participate in this world gathering. It is indeed regrettable that those women at the grassroots who have been at the forefront of all the advances achieved in the fields covered by this Forum have been denied the opportunity to share experiences with their sisters. <p>And finally, the issue of facilities, organization, and access to information through independent newspapers. For two days running, a significant number of Forum participants have been excluded from joining in key events because of inadequate facilities. First the opening ceremony and then the opening plenary session. Participants have told us about rooms that are too small and equipment that is faulty or inadequate. And facilities and access for people with disabilities are wholly inadequate.<p>I am setting down these concerns at the start of the Forum in the hope that you will be able to address them quickly. Until they are solved, we fear that the crucial issues that must be debated by the women at this Forum will be overshadowed by anger, apprehension and confusion. <p>In yesterday's issue of Forum 95 you were quoted as saying that "protesters are free to use any area in the forum site as the rules of the United Nations demands, and we will go by that". As well you offered assurances that freedom of expression will be guaranteed and that clarification of this issue has been obtained from the Chinese government. <p>I would urge you to do everything within your power to ensure that the opportunity for real freedom of expression prevails at the Forum to ensure the vital contribution of everyone at this conference.<p>Sincerely,<p>Pierre Sane<br>Secretary General<p><hr>©Copyright: Amnesty International September 1995<hr> <a href="index.html"><img src="amnesty_pix/amnesty_logo2.gif"> Amnesty International</a><hr></body></html>

<html><head><title>NI Issue 272 - Health - the facts</title></head><body bgcolor="#8FBC8F"><h3><img hspace=10 vspace=10 width=100 height=88 border=1 src="../ni_pix/nilogo.gif">New Internationalist Issue 272</h3><br><i>The material that follows has been provided by  <a href="../NIinfo.html">  New Internationalist</a></i><hr><h1>Health - the facts</h1><b>Today's world is not a picture of health.</b> Increases in longevity and improved child survival have been overshadowed by an ever-widening gap in health between rich and poor.<p>But there have been some gains. Eight out of ten children have been vaccinated against the major childhood killers. And between 1980 and 1993 infant mortality fell by 25% and overall life expectancy increased by more than four years.<p><hr width=71%><h3>GREAT EXPECTATIONS</h3><img hspace=10 vspace=10 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=left src="facts_expectations.gif"><b>Poverty, according to the World Health Organization, is the world's deadliest disease.</b> The wealth-health gap for under-fives is remarkable - in some rich countries 6 out of every 1,000 children die before the age of five, whereas in 16 low-income countries the rate is over 200 per 1,000. In Niger it is 320 per 1,000.<p>Life expectancies are nearly twice as high in rich countries as they are in poor ones. In five of the poorest, life expectancy will decrease by the year 2000, while in some of the richest it will increase from around 76 to 79 years. The relationship between life expectancy and GNP is obvious, as the chart (left) shows.<br clear=all><p><hr width=71%><img hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right src="facts_spender.gif"><p> <h3>HEY BIG SPENDER</h3><b>There are big differences in the percentages that governments spend on health</b> - though the percentages translate very differently into actual money - for example, Costa Rica spends $132 per person on health but 32% of its budget while Canada spends $1,945, which is only 5.2% of its budget. Most regions in the Majority World can only afford to spend between 2% and 6% of their budgets on health, while industrialized countries spend nearly twice that amount - 13% on average.<h3>A question of access</h3>While more spending on health is a good thing, in most Southern countries three-quarters of healthcare goes to the cities, whereas the majority of the population lives in rural areas - and therefore has limited access to health services. Three-quarters of deaths in these countries could be prevented by primary health-care, but most of the budgets go on expensive cures.<font size=-2>2</b><br clear=all><p><hr width=71%><center><img hspace=10 vspace=10 src="facts_drugbiz.gif"></center><br clear=left><p><h3>A significant proportion of the world's drugs are either used inappropriately or don't work.</h3><li> An estimated $9 billion is wasted every year because of the irrational use of antibiotics.3<li> Two-thirds of all drugs used by children may have little or no value. $1 billion a year is wasted on useless antidiarrhoeal drugs and cough and cold remedies, mainly in the Majority World.4<li> German companies sold 65% of their irrational drugs in 1991/92 exclusively to the Majority World - these drugs could not be sold in Germany.5<li> Cheap effective remedies are often overlooked. Iodine-deficiency disorders cause 30,000 stillbirths each year and over 120,000 babies are born with severe disabilities. The solution - iodizing salt supplies - costs as little as $0.05 per person per year. <p><br clear=all><hr width=71%><p> <h3>ALL IN THE MIND</h3><b>Mental ill health is at the bottom of medical priorities, with severe conditions getting minimal care even in wealthy countries. Yet:</b><br><li> Some 500 million people suffer from neurotic, stress-related and psychosomatic disorders.<li> Some 200 million more suffer from mood disorders, such as depression, with 59 million people disabled.<li>Around 150 million people suffer from congenital mental conditions.<p><br clear=all><hr width=71%><img hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right src="facts_killers.jpg"><p> <h3>KILLERS</h3><b>The largest numbers of deaths </b>are through communicable and, often, treatable diseases. Combined with deaths related to childbearing they account for 40% of global deaths: 99% of these occur in the Majority World.<p>Former 'diseases of prosperity' such as cancer and heart disease are now equally split between the 'developed' and 'developing' world. This is mainly due to the spread of pollution and fatty diets in the South. Smoking kills three million people a year and is the largest single preventable cause of death. There are many diseases which don't always kill but which worsen the quality of life for millions. Each year, diarrhoea affects 1.8 billion children under five, and sexually transmitted diseases affect 297 million new people.<p><br clear=all><hr width=71%><p><h3>WATER TREATMENT</h3><img hspace=15 vspace=10 align=left src="facts_water.jpg"><br><br><br><b>The majority of the world's population lacks adequate sanitation, </b>thus providing good conditions for infectious diseases to spread. The lack of safe drinking water leaves the channels open for waterborne scourges.<br clear=all><p><hr width=71%><p>  <h3>WORKING IT IN</h3><li> Some 120 million occupational accidents with more than 200,000 deaths are estimated to occur every year.<li>Each year there are between 68 and 157 million new cases of work-related diseases.<li> More than 30% of workers in industrialized countries complain about stress and overload. The total economic loss amounts to 10-15% of GNP in these countries.6<p><hr width=71%><img hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right src="facts_immunity.gif"><p>  <h3>IMMUNITY</h3><b>World goals are to immunize at least 90% of the world's children and 90% of women of childbearing age by the year 2000.</b> But the gains of the last two decades are now being eroded by apathetic policies. Immunization rates in Africa are only around 50%. Inner cities of many industrialized countries have immunization rates lower than those in 'developing' countries. Around 2.4 million deaths of children under five are still due to vaccine-preventable diseases. The efficacy of vaccines themselves is now under fire in the West.<br clear=all><p><br clear=all><hr width=71%><p>All facts, unless otherwise noted, are taken from the World Health Organization's World Health Report 1995: Bridging the Gaps (WHO, Geneva).<br> <b>1</b> State of the World's Children 1995 (UNICEF).<br> <b>2 </b>The Ethical Consumer: Special Report on the Pharmaceutical  Industry, No 32, November 1994. <br><b>3</b> Superbug: Nature's Revenge G Cannon (Virgin Books, London 1995). <br><b>4</b> Scrip, No 1633, 12 July 1991.<br><b> 5 </b>An Alternative Report on Trade ICDA (Brussels, 1995).<br><b>  6 </b>In Point of Fact WHO, No 84, April 1995.<hr> ©Copyright: New Internationalist 1995<hr><a href="../index.html"><img hspace=10 vspace=10 width=35 height=30 src="../ni_pix/nilogo3.gif"> NI Home Page</a> <a href="contents.html"><img hspace=10 vspace=10 hpspace=2 width=30 height=50 src="cover272_thumb.gif"> Issue 272 Contents</a><hr></body></html>

A Sustainable Development Act <i>by Tony Wrench</i>

</h3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

&quot;The UK is determined to make sustainable development the touchstone of its policies. We recognise that this means a change of attitudes throughout the nation. That change cannot be achieved overnight, but that gives no grounds for defeatism - it should instead act as a spur to action.&quot; 

<br>

(John Gummer, Sec. of State for the Environment, in the introduction to Sustainable Development - The UK Strategy, Jan 1994)

</BLOCKQUOTE>

All the indications from the actions of local authorities, business and central government in this country since those stirring words were written two years ago, suggest that few people have any idea of how to assess a development for its sustainability, nor even any incentive to do so. Supermarkets and factories still consume green fields, roads and increased traffic continue to drive wildlife into smaller and smaller corners and waste in many forms continues to pollute the environment.



<p>

This is a suggestion for a new law that would focus our attention on sustainable development in one extremely important area, that of land use, and that if implemented would be a verifiable indicator that unsustainable development had ceased and that the tide had turned. It would not supplant existing planning laws, but be additional to them.



<blockquote><B>Could there be a way for legislation to help stop this seemingly inexorable slow suffocation of the natural world?</B></blockquote>

        

A Sustainable Development Act would recognise that a stop must be made to encroachment on the living skin of our island home from any more net development, as a means to ensuring the quality of what is left of our green environment for future generations, and to preserve the complexity and diversity of the living world. The crucial word here is 'net'. It would be hopelessly unrealistic to expect a total halt to all building or development of any kind. The fact is, however, that our developments have been so wasteful in the past that there is almost unlimited scope for further development by using more efficiently land already developed, or re-greening what has already been built on. 

<p>

The Act would require that:

<p>

All developments of whatever nature that involve the covering of any area of green land by concrete, brick, tarmac etc. must first have been balanced by the 'greening' of exactly the same amount of developed land in the same bio-region.

<p>

(For these purposes 'bio-region' means the catchment area of the major river in the region. Bio-region is suggested rather than administrative area because an ecological loss in one bio-region would not be adequately compensated for by a greening in another.)

<p>

Greening would involve in most cases breaking up the existing hard-pan and structures, replacing topsoil, landscaping and planting with native plants, shrubs and trees appropriate to the locality.

<p>

Every proposal would be assessed by ecologist inspectors, and if a development were to involve the destruction of some existing animal or plant habitat, a new adjacent and appropriate habitat must be created before any development takes place.

<p>

The Act would be specific on the ways in which areas of land were 'balanced' and on methods of enforcement in the case of breach.

<p>

Broadly speaking, we would expect to see local authorities earmarking areas of road, industrial wasteland and redundant buildings as areas suitable for balancing future developments. A new road by-passing a town might be balanced, for example, by the greening over of dozens of minor roads elsewhere in the town centre. The balancing would be simply square metre for square metre. If the development were by a private or commercial enterprise, the balancing land would need to be purchased and greened in advance in the same way.

<p>

<h3>EFFECTS</h3>

<p>

The main effect of this Sustainable Development Act would be to create a new series of mental models in business and public organisations that would bring developmental and sustainability considerations into line with each other. At present, as we all know, they are almost diametrically opposed. A supermarket wishing to construct a new store in or near a town would have a whole series of new realities to face:

<ol>

<li>Green field sites are only feasible if the company can locate, purchase and green some old developed land.

<li>It will almost certainly be cheaper to build a supermarket on that developed land than to green it, plus build afresh on the green land.

<li>Space for car parking suddenly becomes extremely expensive! It would pay the supermarket to bus people into the town centre rather than try to balance and green that much developed land.

<li>If the supermarket were still to decide to go ahead on a green field site, acres of new wilderness would be created.

</ol>

<center><blockquote><B>All 'concrete' developments ... must first have been balanced by equivalent greening

</B></blockquote></center>

Take another example - a county council wants to build a by-pass around a market town:

<ol>

<li>Building the road through an SSSI or a wood with many diverse habitats would be impossible. Even if adjacent developed land were available for greening, it might take a hundred years to recreate appropriate habitats.

<li>Building under woods or green fields would be a viable option, with considerably less balancing to be done, but the cost would be so high that other more sustainable options would have to be considered, such as new public transport systems.

<li>If the council decided to go ahead with a new by-pass through green fields, it would have to green scores of acres of developed land in the area. This would undoubtedly improve the quality of life of the local inhabitants, as well as safeguarding habitats for wildlife.

</ol>

<p>

In the longer term, we might expect the effects to show themselves by an environment in which cities and towns become much greener, with no dead or derelict areas. Buildings would be designed efficiently. Wilderness areas such as forests would come right up to town outskirts. Industrial areas would be much less visible - the older factories from the 20th century would be surrounded by woods, and the newer 21st century ones would be underground.

<p>

As one of the 150 countries signing the declaration at the Rio Summit, and as one of the most extensively developed countries in the world the UK has a great opportunity, not to say duty, to take a lead in seeking that its development is sustainable. By passing a law such as this, the government would be taking great step for our children's children, and for the biosphere on which they will depend.

<a name="tonyt"></a><h3>TLIO Travelling Light by Tony Thomson</h3>



Since the first hunter-gatherers crossed the European land bridge, nomadism has been an indigenous activity. It is nothing new, 90% of human existence has been experienced as nomadic. It is a profoundly human activity. Nomos is the Greek word for pasture, since the domestication of animals began (8000BC) it came to mean law, fair distribution and that which is allocated by custom. The activity, however, precedes the word and has been practised here for over 100,000 years. Custom is derived from habitual usage and practice.

<p>

The hegemony established by the Norman conquest has made constant assaults on custom by laws which enable the theory of individual ownership to supplant earlier mystical and more egalitarian notions of our relationship with the natural world. Custom survives because of the common sense of people who do not belong to the culture which towers over them. Its expression in the form of communal ritual and traditional practice has always irked authority and it is no different today.

<p>

The rural theatre of the fair is a perpetuation of much older pagan ritual. Celebrated at ancient sites with music, dancing, courtship, rough games, and role playing, these festivals are a form of sympathetic magic to draw fructifying vital energies through the land. They are an affirmation of a community and personal relationship with a Living Earth untrammelled by the mediation of the church, state or landowning baron.

<p>

Associating 'uncontrolled' popular recreation with public disorder, such festivals were banned in 1356 by feudal lords, in 1555 by the Calvinist Scots, in 1660 by Cromwell puritans, in 1850 by Victorian gentry and in 1985, 1987 and 1994 by the Conservative party in government. As loci for cultural and economic exchange festivals are a target for expropriation for those who wish to monopolise activity in these areas.



<center><blockquote><B>Nomadic dwelling weaves human habitation into a web of life.</B></blockquote></center>



There is a long association between travelling people and festivals, well before 'Gypsies' or 'Tsigans' were publicly recorded in Western Europe (in the 14th C), all mountebanks and travelling showmen found themselves dubbed 'Egyptians'. Since mobility enhances income, capitalism generated nomadic activity. Retail, craft and labour services all originate in nomadic practice, merchants, cathedral builders, journeymen craftsmen, strolling players and agricultural labourers all 'tramped' and in contemporary form, many still do. As well as being an avenue for economic opportunity the road is sanctuary for the refugee. Slavery, war, desertification, enclosure and homelessness generate nomadic behaviour, it is an instinctive and perennial response to environmental stress.

<p>

Sanctuary however, is not necessarily just a condition of material well-being, it has a spiritual dimension. The ritual pilgrimage is as relevant today as it ever was, an opportunity of escape from the mundane to quest for some deeper revelation, the serf escaping slavery on the road to Canterbury to praise a god who, brought him 'out of the land of Egypt and delivered you from the house of bondage' (Deuteronomy Ch3v5) or for the Leveller 300 years later 'upon our march from Egypt to Canaan from a land of bondage and darkness to a land of liberty and rest' or the New Age Gypsies singing Bob Marley's Exodus on their way to Stonehenge. Like Bunyan (a tinker) author of Pilgrims Progress it begins 'As I walked through the wilderness of the world', for between eviction and settlement is the 'wilderness condition' symbol of disorder, darkness, death, place of testing, punishment, refuge, contemplation and ultimately redemption.

<p>

All of these stimuli to migration and movement exist still, their form may have changed but essentially they remain.

<p>

The Criminal Justice Act and Planning system attempt to impose an idyllic view of social and spatial order to perpetuate an inherently unstable and iniquitous relationship with Nature.

<p>

Nomadic dwelling weaves human habitation into a web of life in which hedgerow trees and herbage afford shelter, shade, fuel and food. However the traditional sites which are naturally abundant within the rural landscape have been systematically denied in a new rash of Enclosure. In the areas surveyed, between 60% and 90% of traditional sites have been gated, ditched and encroached upon since 1986 in a continuing covert policy of site denial. Droves around the periphery of market towns have been particularly vulnerable to closure because of the nomads perceived threat to property values and their proximity to anticipated urban expansion. The outcome of this massive loss of habitat, in conjunction with an influx of refugees, has been the creation of overcrowded, overused sites in more unsuitable locations.

<p>

Traditional patterns of site usage offer the facility for population dispersal, discreet location and rotational conservation. The knowledge that there is fresh ground in the vicinity after the expiry of the one presently occupied engenders a spirit of co-operation and obviates the need for expensive legal action.

<p>

Agenda 21 calls for a new kind of customary consciousness, a re-evaluation of our relationship with land through the resources we consume and the lifestyle we lead. Growing environmental awareness is cultivating a greater appreciation of the virtues of nomadic dwelling, in its rotational conservation of land, in its minimal material and economic requirements to achieve shelter, in a subsistence economy which liberates time and minimises dependency, and in a mobility which can respond to economic, social and environmental need.

<a name="suec"></a><h3>TLIO Dear People of Brighton by Sue Craske</h3>

<p>

Dear People of Brighton,

<p>

We have one of the most lively and exciting towns in Britain. There is one thing that I and many friends with young children yearn for though, and that is more open space for recreation, sitting outdoors, or just somewhere for children to expend some of their considerable energy without wearing the parents out as well!

<p>

There are several very pleasant areas if you are lucky enough to live near to them, e.g. Preston Park and the Rock Garden, Tarnerland Park, East Brighton Park, Queens Park. There are several areas which have few or no parks or open spaces within easy walking distance , e.g. Coombe Road area, Hanover, North Laine, central Brighton, Hollingdean.

<p>

Even if a local park exists nearby, children and adults appreciate variety and visiting different places. More could be made of the existing open spaces. They could be enhanced with community landscaping so that people would want to use them. So many parks are under-used, apart from the kids' playgrounds, dog areas, and occasional football matches. Kids' playgrounds are the only places most parents can take them which don't cost them money or petrol and where people don't resent the presence of children.



<center><blockquote><B>Landscape based play areas are rare, but are the sort of places people didn't realise they would like.</B></blockquote></center>



When we adults were children, we had many more opportunities to play outside in wild or natural environments. Many of these remembered places have been built on, grubbed up and flattened, or are used as car parks. Others require car journeys and accompanying adults because they are on the fringes of the town or in the country.

<p>

 Most children in this town only have small patio gardens or the street for regular outside play. The street is a desirable though dangerous place to play. Kids enjoy meeting their friends and riding their bikes up and down the pavement. (Building sites and waste ground too were exciting places to play.) A patch of earth to mould into hills, valleys, rivers and holes is fun but is unavailable to many children.

<p>

Children's and parents' real needs are not recognised most of the time. Playgrounds are all very well, but there is much evidence that children need to be able to explore 'places' to learn and develop social and mental skills and physical well being. Fixed play equipment is not stimulating for very long and is generally the same as in any other playground. Landscape based play areas are rare, but are the sort of places people don't yet realise they would like. Think of the sort of places you may have played in as a child. These were places where you could hide: secret little nooks and crannies where you could plot strategies with friends. There were hills, banks and ditches, dens and trees to climb. Kids prefer trees and fallen trunks to climb on rather than climbing frames - there is an element of discovery and danger. They would rather make a den between bushes than have a play house provided by an adult, where nothing can be moved around. A small garden around those on The Level would increase their attractiveness to children no end. You could imagine all sorts of stories and scenarios in these 'found' places. Landscape based play environments could still be used in wet weather and in the winter. Children could still have a lot of fun running around a stimulating environment, without getting wet bottoms from wet swings and slides.

<p>

Elsewhere in the country, local people are joining together. With grants and fund raising, they are creating exciting new community open spaces or preserving wildlife areas. Couldn't we do that here?

<p>

There would be all sorts of social benefits. It would bring people together and foster community spirit. People can learn new skills and increase their confidence. People notice things about their environment they would have overlooked before. They would appreciate other parts of Brighton which received the same sort of attention. If children were involved they would want to care for the park they helped to create, rather than vandalise it. If they could help plant up the park, they would be concerned for the plants they had put in.

<p>

Brighton people are starting to care about their environment. People want some restriction on the use of cars, which, thankfully, the Labour group is encouraging, because government hasn't done anything about it. They can see that the town is choked up with cars. Kids can't play safely on the streets. Providing a few more pleasant places within walking distances of where people live would help to reduce traffic. We would not need to get in a car to escape to the country so often, and people without cars would not feel so restricted.

<p>

I have since got involved with the 'Friends of' a local park from the initial stages. It is certainly good for the council to direct the frustrations and energy of ordinary people like me into an area where their funding is low. Trouble is, there is no money and very little support and lots of difficult problems to overcome - but people are joining in with us at last - more in the future maybe.

<p>

Yours in hope

<p>

Sue Craske

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Spanish Development Cooperation</h3>

Spanish development assistance is closely related to historical and linguistic relations and cultural activities
in Latin America, as well as to Spanish commercial interests, and to geographic proximity and migratory
pressures from Northern Africa. Official Spanish development cooperation started in 1985, when the first
aid programme was initiated. NGO development activities date back to the 1950s and even the 1940s. In
1983 Spain was removed from the DAC list of developing countries. The country became a member of
DAC in December 1991. The public is concerned with domestic problems of high unemployment, economic
recession, immigration, and racism. However, in a recent opinion poll 65 per cent of the public declared
itself in favour of raising the aid budget to 0.7 per cent of GNP, a target requested by a Parliamentary
report in 1992. Parliamentary support for development cooperation is quite strong, in contrast to the actual
measures taken by the Government.
<p>
Net official development assistance in 1992 stood at US $ 1 518 million, corresponding with 0.26 per cent
of GNP, after a period of decline in the 1980s. Forecasts for 1993 and 1994 are around 0.24 per cent of
GNP. After a considerable rise in multilateral contributions, they fell to 0.25 in 1992. The greater part, 0.20
per cent of total ODA, went to the EU budget and the EDF. The EU-share was the second most important
component of ODA in 1992, after the concessional official export credits through the FAD (Fondo de
Ayuda al Desarrollo), which reached 56 percent of ODA in 1992.
<p>
<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>
<p>
Spanish development cooperation still lacks a unified development concept, a centralised aid budget and the
corresponding administrative structures. Government development cooperation structures are relatively
young and their staff has limited experience. 
<p>
A law establishing a legislative basis for development cooperation, will probably be voted by Parliament
during 1994. Until now development cooperation is based on ad hoc administrative rules, although already
in 1984 the Senate approved a motion on international cooperation.
<p>
There is no Minister for Development Cooperation. The administration of Spanish aid is spread over a
dozen ministries, the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation (AECI, established 1988) and the
Institute for Official Credits (ICO). Each ministry has a separate aid budget. Autonomous regions and some
municipalities also have their own aid programmes, mostly implemented by NGOs. The Ministry for
Foreign Affairs (MFA) has a State Secretariat for International Cooperation and Latin America (SECIPI,
established 1985). It is responsible for the programming, control and evaluation of the aid programme of the
MFA, and it is in charge of the coordination of the aid activities by other ministries. Its role is nonetheless
rather limited, since it administers only a small share of the aid programme (10 per cent of ODA including
AECI's share in 1992, otherwise 2 per cent).
<p>
The largest share of reported Spanish ODA falls under the responsibility of the State Secretariat of Trade of
the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism (MCT). It deals with FAD's extensive loan programme which is
administered by the Institute for Official Credits, and with the contributions to international financing
institutions. Other multilateral contributions are mainly handled by the Ministry of Economy and Finance
(MEF).
<p>
The bilateral technical cooperation programme is designed and carried out by the Agency AECI directly, or
subcontracted to others. AECI is managed by a Governing Council and an Executive Committee. It receives
its funds from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to which it is attached through SECIPI. AECI is organised
along geographical lines in three institutes, that can be compared with directorates-general: the Institute for
Iberian American Cooperation (ICI), responsible for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Institute for
Cooperation with Arab Countries (ICMA), in charge of cooperation with Arab countries and other countries
in the Middle East and North Africa, and the Institute for Development Cooperation (ICD), which covers
sub-Saharan Africa (mainly Portuguese speaking countries in Africa) and Asia. The ICD and the ICMA are
bound to merge in a current administrative reorganisation. Compared with 1989 AECI's budget for 1994 is
reduced by half.
<p>
The most important other ministries involved include Labour and Social Security, Education and Science,
Health, and Social Affairs.
<p>
To coordinate the various aid activities an Interministerial Commission for International Cooperation (CICI)
was established in 1986, chaired by the Foreign Minister, in which fourteen ministries are represented. The
CICI used to meet twice a year. In order to strengthen the role of the Commission, the number of meetings
has been increased, following the 1992 Parliamentary recommendations. CICI discusses the Annual Plan for
Development Cooperation (PACI), the inventory of activities and programmes for development cooperation
(not allocations or budgets) of all ministries involved. PACI is prepared by SECIPI's Planning and
Evaluation Office (OPE). These plans, after an elaborate procedure, are submitted for approval to the
Council of Ministers.
<p>
After preparation in various departments of the MCT, FAD credits are submitted to the Interministerial
FAD Commission (CIFAD), which meets about six times a year. Final approval is given by the Council of
Ministers. The Commission, chaired by the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism, is composed of senior
officials from several ministries, including MFA/SECIPI, Economy and Finance, Public Works and
Transport, Agriculture and Fisheries, Industry and Energy, and the Bank of Spain.
<p>
The Parliamentary report of 1992 envisages to strengthen the coordination of the various instruments of
Spanish aid. Although the MFA, SECIPI, and the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism are represented
already on both the CICI and the FAD Commission, and although recommendations of both commissions
need the approval of the Council of Ministers, coordination might be improved. 
<p>
Many internal consultation mechanisms do exist for day-to-day policy implementation. AECI's president is
in charge of the Emergency Aid Group, by which SECIPI coordinates emergency programmes. Members of
the Group are the Ministries of MFA, of Defense, of the Interior, and Health and Consumption, the Cruz
Roja, UNICEF, Caritas, and IBERIA. Supporting the conclusions of the 1992 Parliamentary Report, the
Government has taken steps to improve the use of the PACI as a planning instrument, to strengthen the role
of the CICI. In addition the CICI approved guidelines for Spanish development cooperation in February
1994, to be operational in 1995.
<p>
The annual budget plan PACI is published. SECIPI has an evaluation office OPE, and MCT has its own
evaluation system for FAD (mainly directed towards the verification of the proper use of funds). Evaluations
are not published. Planning, monitoring and evaluation procedures are to be revised and evaluation
frequencies stepped up. The State Secretariat of Commerce issues a magazine about Spanish development
cooperation, 'Informaci&#243;n Commercial Espa&#241;ola'.
<p>
<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>
<p>
There is no formal advisory structure in Spain. However, the Government considers the establishment of a
Consultative Council for Development Cooperation which would be composed of representatives of NGOs,
universities, trade unions, and industries. It would create a discussion platform on development cooperation
with relevant groups in Spanish society. From the side of the NGOs this plan is favoured by the
Coordinadora, a platform in which 70 NGOs are assembled.
<p>
The members of Parliament and the Foreign Affairs Committee of both houses of Parliament are well aware
of the problems in developing countries, of the Spanish administration's need for change, and they are
actively engaged in discussing the strengthening of the Spanish aid performance. Annually the Secretary of
State for Cooperation presents the Plan for Development Cooperation to the Foreign Affairs Commission.
<p>
<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>
<p>
There are about 200 Spanish NGOs active in the field of development assistance. They have their origins in
the Church, in professional organisations, in political and solidarity committees, and in trade unions. Some
of them raise a considerable amount of money from the public, far exceeding the amount received from the
Government. Spanish ODA channelled through NGOs has increased somewhat in the last years, but fell in
1992 to 2 per cent of total ODA. Funds are allocated on a project-by-project base, through annual
competitive bidding and a rather elaborate procedure. Half a dozen larger, experienced organisations receive
more than half of the official support. Most NGO activities are located in Latin America.
<p>
The NGOs, regrouped in a single platform, Coordinadora, with 70 members, want to be more involved in
policy discussions with the Government and in decision making. They are pleading for larger government
support, and for effective procedures and greater openness on official aid activities, in particular on FAD
credits. The Government intends to expand the cooperation with NGOs.
<p>
Trade unions recently have become more active in the field of development cooperation. The two largest
unions decided to set aside 0.7 per cent of the membership fees (one), or of all trade union income (the
other); they started awareness raising campaigns.
<p>
According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey, 16 institutes in Spain qualify as Development Research and
Training Institutes. Some are involved in government development policy debates, studies or consultancy
work. Generally, government institutions are only allowed to contract outside consultants for a one time
period of 3 - 4 years.

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of French Development
Cooperation</h3>

France's official cooperation with developing countries, which dates from the early
1960s, is an extension of its earlier decolonisation policies and administrative set-up.
The annual opinion poll shows that the French public is concerned about the problem of
the hunger issue, and that there is a growing support for aid to Third World
development (25 per cent in 1992).
<p>
Net official development assistance in 1992 stood at US $ 8 270 million, or 0.63 per
cent of GNP. After a period of growth, ODA disbursements are expected to rise only
slightly after 1992. About three-quarters of French ODA is bilateral aid. 24 percent was
disbursed multilaterally in 1992, nearly half via the EU.
<p>
<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>
<p>
Development cooperation is based on a number of successive constitutional laws that
defined France's relationship with its colonies/former colonies, and was elaborated
subsequently in numerous decrees by the President and the Prime Minister. The
administrative set-up and allocation of responsibilities have changed over the years,
following the domestic political situation. 
<p>
Policy preparation, formulation and implementation is spread over four main ministries -
Cooperation and Development (MCD), Foreign Affairs (MFA), Finance and Economic
Affairs (MEA) and the Interior, five or so technical ministries and many (semi-) official
and (semi-) autonomous agencies (educational and training institutes, research
institutes, and NGOs), the latter category being involved mainly in implementation.
<p>
Overall and strategic policy coordination are the responsibilities of the Offices of the
President and Prime Minister. Over and above the internal administrative structure of
the various ministries, decision making is the prerogative of a 'Cabinet', the Office of
each Minister.
<p>
There is no centralised budget for development cooperation, although the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Affairs keeps an overall record of the budget for and expenditure
on development cooperation by the various departments and institutions. 
 
The Ministry of Cooperation and Development, created in 1961 on the basis of the
previous administrative set-up for a French Commonwealth, is responsible for technical,
financial, cultural, military and scientific aid to 'du champ' countries (14.7 per cent of
ODA in 1992). The MCD has the most technical and sectoral expertise of all the
ministries. 
<p>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has traditionally been responsible for French external
cultural policy in countries not within France's sphere of influence. Within the MFA the
Directorate-General for Cultural and Scientific Relations is responsible for technical,
cultural and scientific cooperation in the 'hors champ' countries (8.7 per cent of ODA in
1992). Another department handles multilateral cooperation and UN relations (24 per
cent of ODA in 1992). The MFA conducts major policy debates, e.g. on security and
European issues. 
<p>
The Treasury at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs and the MFA are
currently considered as having the greatest influence on policy matters. The Treasury
disburses financial aid (loans and grants) and, together with the Ministry of
Cooperation, finances debt cancellations in the 'du champ' countries. The Treasury
functions as a consultative body for macro-economic matters, drawing on the
substantial analytical and economic expertise of the CfD (Caisse Fran&#231;aise de
D&#233;veloppement).
<p>
Disbursements to the TOMs, as well as to the DOMs, are administered by a State
Secretariat (Ministry of Overseas Departments and Territories; MODT) under the
authority of the Ministry of the Interior. 
<p>
The technical ministries of Research (7.7 per cent of ODA in 1992), Health, Education
(1992: 8.4 per cent of ODA), Agriculture and Culture each manage their own projects.
<p>
Various development institutions implement projects and programmes, often through
specialist agencies working under them. The Fonds d'Aide et de Coop&#233;ration
(FAC), which is a fund without corporate status, administers economic and social
infrastructure projects. The CfD, a banking agency created in 1941, finances through
its many agencies state approved loans for productive investment projects in the 'du
champ' countries, and recently also in some 'hors champ' countries. The technical
ministries operate in the 'du champ' countries often through institutions working under
their authority. Cooperation with development institutes, the private sector, NGOs and
experts in respect of project identification, assessment and preparation, and
implementation and evaluation of technical cooperation is widespread. In addition, there
are various institutions responsible for the training of and technical support for the
French "cooperants." 
<p>
Policy planning and formulation is a complex process involving many institutions, at
various levels. The main actors are the government institutions and agencies
responsible for French cooperation and the relevant interministerial consultative
structures. While policy formulation and decisions are strictly the responsibility of the
Government, many outside actors are involved at a more technical level. 
<p>
As far as the evaluation function is concerned, generally speaking, a systematic and
independent evaluation structure would seem to be lacking, although all institutions for
development cooperation in principle have an evaluation procedure for ODA-funded
operations. Evaluation and programming units are often part of the internal audit or
statistical function. Procedures for feedback and coordination of evaluation activities
will have to be developed. Some institutions have an evaluation or programming unit,
that has input into policy formulation. Since 1989 the Ministry of Cooperation and
Development for instance has had a Studies, Evaluation and Prospective Analysis
Mission that plans policy on the basis of its reviews of French assistance to 'du champ'
countries. Summaries of the findings are for government use only. 
<p>
Since foreign policy, including aid, is a 'shared' concern, coordination of development
cooperation policy ultimately rests with the President of the Republic and the Prime
Minister. They play a discrete but important and, if necessary, arbitrating role. The
State Secretariat of Planning ('le Plan') at the Prime Minister's Office has an important
coordinating function, as has the 'Cabinet' of each minister.
<p>
In 1992 the Government set up a Committee for Orientation and Programming (COP) to
ensure greater complementarity and coherence of cooperation activities in the 'du
champ' countries. Chaired by the Minister of Cooperation, COP is composed of
representatives from his own Ministry, the MFA, the MEA and the CfD. It has
apparently met infrequently. Suggestions for improvements have been put forward.
<p>
Since EU affairs fall under the Prime Minister, several ministries participate in EU policy
preparation, the MFA having a leading role. The General Secretariat of the
Interministerial Committee (SGCI) defines and coordinates the French position on
European affairs. 
<p>
Consultations between ministries and departments on specific topics do occur, e.g.
between the MCD, MFA, MEA/Treasury, the President's Office and the Ministries of
Environment and Agriculture during the preparations for UNCED. Informal talks are held
on trade, multilateral cooperation, treasury matters and cooperation procedures. Policies
and programmes for 'hors champ' countries are coordinated ad hoc by the departments
concerned. However, the frequency of such talks on the 'hors champ' countries is
considered low. Trade and investment relations with developing countries are discussed
with the Agency for Technical, Industrial and Economic Cooperation (ACTIM).
<p>
Project proposals for funding from FAC or CfD funds are handled in a Project
Committee, chaired by the Minister for Cooperation and Development. CfD activities are
coordinated by a 'Conseil d'Administration' which comprises representatives of the
MCD, MFA, MEA and the Ministry of the Interior (DOM/TOMs). The FAC, which is
chaired by the Minister for Cooperation and Development, comprises representatives of
departments involved in development cooperation.
<p>
<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and
Mechanisms</h3></a>
<p>
France has strong central governmental institutions. There is a certain reluctancy to
seek official external advice; there is no tradition of this, and no formal structure for it.
In fact much advice is given during technical and political consultations. The dividing
lines between 'consultation', 'advising' and 'decision-making' are not always clear to
outsiders.
<p>
The Minister for Cooperation and Development submits an annual Statement on aid to
Parliament, as an annex to the Finance Act. The National Assembly has a Foreign
Affairs Committee. However, no substantial discussions appear to be conducted in
Parliament.
<p>
<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>
<p>
Many outside actors make an indirect contribution at least to the
preparation of future policies. First, there are the many research institutes - both
government-financed and independent - that have many years of experience and a
wealth of technical knowledge about the Third World. They undertake studies on their
own initiative and/or may be contracted in by government institutions. Secondly,
private organisations - NGOs and businesses - and the "reseaux" -- sectoral networks
with a broad basis in French society, are involved in implementation and consultation
(see below). Finally, the informal and institutional contacts between politicians at
various levels and individual experts, in organisations ranging from the 'Syndicats
d'Agricole', the White Fathers and M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res, play an
important role in policy consultation and preparation.
<p>
The following categories of organisations, more or less outside the Government, could
be listed as having an 'advisory' impact on French development cooperation policy and
its implementation: informal, mixed brainstorming groups; NGOs and the bureaux
d'&#233;tudes; networks (reseaux); parastatal or state-owned research institutes and
independent research institutes and individual members of their staff. 
<p>
Ad hoc working groups or committees may be appointed to deal with specific subjects,
e.g. the Scientific Committee on Women in Development set up to prepare for the
1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing, which includes representatives of the
ministries concerned and the French and European Parliaments, and journalists. 
<p>
Some departments responsible for development cooperation have informal
brainstorming relationships with outside specialists and institutions. The Centre
d'Analyse et de Prospective (CAP) for instance is involved in brainstorming and policy
preparation on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It functions in a rather informal
and independent way, with members from inside as well as outside the Government. 
<p>
In 1992 1 per cent of bilateral ODA was disbursed through NGOs. This is supposed to
reach 5 per cent by 2002. Many of the several hundred French NGOs are involved
actively in French cooperation programmes, through project identification and
preparation, implementation, evaluation, studies and discussions. Discussions with the
Government appear to focus more on the project and programme level than on overall
cooperation policy. Government co-financing activities with NGOs in 'du champ' and
'hors champ' countries are coordinated by an Associations Bureau that both reports to
the MCD and the MFA. 
<p>
The largest of the NGOs (which are now called Associations (or Organisations) for
International Solidarity (AIS) are organised in eight Development Collectives. The largest
collective, created in 1990, is the Comit&#233; de Liaison des Organisations de
Solidarit&#233; Internationale (CLOSI). It comprises eight umbrella organisations that
represent around 250 NGOs. CLOSI, which is financed entirely by the Government, was
set up to improve links between the NGOs themselves and between NGOs and the
Government. A Development Cooperation Board comprising representatives of the
MCD, the MFA, the technical ministries and the NGOs and chaired by the Minister of
Cooperation and Development discusses topics of more general interest. Discussion are
being held on creating a new structure for the joint management, on an equal footing,
of public funds for NGOs: a Public Interest Group (Groupement d'Inter&#234;t Public
(GIP). Many NGOs also have a study and research capacity (the 'bureaux
d'&#233;tudes') and carry out government contracts, for instance GRET, SolaGral,
SURVIE, AGIR-ICI and institutes such as the Institut des Sciences et des Techniques de
l'Equipement et de l'Environnement pour le D&#233;veloppement (ISTEED). An
Evaluation Fund has been established for NGO activities, managed jointly by the NGOs,
the MCD, the MFA and the CfD.
<p>
Since 1992 nine networks (reseaux) have been created on the initiative of the MCD,
comprising institutions and individuals with a recognised interest and expertise in
development cooperation (e.g. farmers' organisations, communities, national and
international women's organisations, NGOs, ex-"cooperants"), as a consultative
structure for the Ministry. These networks, which are financed entirely by the MCD,
were originally set up to work out the details of sectoral programmes for the MCD and
to mobilise development cooperation initiatives in France. They are organised by topics
(e.g. health, women in development, food production). They also have a brainstorming
function: to generate and exchange ideas on development cooperation. In addition they
conduct studies, distribute information on French development cooperation and liaise
with French development institutions, expatriates in developing countries and local
partners (notably in Africa). The original idea was that the networks would grow into
solidarity organisations and undertake development activities. They would appear,
however, to be turning increasingly into implementing agencies for the MCD, although
their relationship with the Ministry is not without its problems. 
<p>
Many large state-owned institutes traditionally do research and carry out studies for the
French Government. The following are well known for their work in development
cooperation: the Institut Fran&#231;ais de Recherche Scientifique pour le
D&#233;veloppement en Coop&#233;ration (ORSTOM), the Centre de
Coop&#233;ration Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le
D&#233;veloppement (CIRAD) and the Institut de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA).
To some extent the CfD can be included in this group. It has a large analytical research
capacity in various macro-economic fields (e.g. privatisation, debt, regional cooperation
and sustainable development).
<p>
According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey there are 103 institutes in France - some
attached to universities, and some not, some government owned, others not - that
qualify as Development Research and Training Institutes. Some of these play a
considerable role in development cooperation studies, consultation and implementation,
on an institutional and/or individual basis. The best known of these are the Centre
d'Etudes et de Recherche sur L'Economie du D&#233;veloppement (CERED) in
Nanterre, the Centre d'Etude et de Recherches sur le D&#233;veloppement
International (CERDI) in Clermont-Ferrand, the Centre d'Etudes et de Recherches
Internationales (CERI) in Paris, the Institut d'Am&#233;nagement R&#233;gional (IAR)
in Aix-en-Provence, the Centre d'Etudes d'Afrique Noire (CEAN) and the Centre
d'Etudes de G&#233;ographie Tropical (CEGET), both in Talence. Eight specialised
institutes for applied scientific research in development cooperation are grouped
together in the Study and Research Group for the Development of Tropical Agriculture
(GERDAT). 
<p>
One group in the business sector that is involved in policy consultation is the Conseil
d'Investisseurs en Afrique Noire (CIAN). There are also other consultative structures in
which the Government consults with representatives of the local authorities, and
Chambers of Commerce.

<a name="org"></a><hr><h3>Organisation of Danish Development Cooperation</h3>

Danish official development assistance, which started in the early 1960s, was based on political, economic,
and charitable motives. According to an opinion poll of February 1993 80 per cent of the population has a
positive attitude towards development assistance. The Government is in the process of expanding the support
base for development cooperation in Danish society. For cooperation in policy formulation, the organisation
of aid and its implementation contacts are being built up between the Government, business and industry,
trade unions, voluntary and professional organisations, research institutions and public sector institutions. 
<p>
Denmark's net official development assistance amounted to US $ 1.392 million in 1992, which was 1.02 per
cent of GNP, increasing slightly to 1.03 per cent in 1993. Since the 1960s disbursements of development aid
have been divided rather equally between bilateral and multilateral channels. In 1992 multilateral aid
constituted 41 per cent of the ODA. An additional 6 per cent of ODA was channelled through the EU. In
1993 ODA will amount to 0,97 per cent of GNP.
<p>
Development policy is an integral part of Danish foreign policy. In the light of global political changes,
Denmark is in the process of evaluating its experiences and adjusting its international development policy
and the organisation of its aid programme. The main objectives of a new policy are laid down in the 1994
strategy plan 'A Developing World, Strategy for Danish Development Policy towards the Year 2000'. 
<p>
Since DANIDA's (Danish International Development Assistance) Plan of Action of 1988, Denmark is in the
process of reducing the number of programme countries from 67 to 20 in 1994. Over half of the bilateral
aid is directed towards Africa (1992). Aid to Asia has declined in 1992, while allocations for Latin
America, for non-country specific aid and for receiving refugees in Denmark have risen. 
<p>
Per programme country a long term strategy is to be elaborated. In 1989 Parliament choose three new
criteria for the selection of programme countries: the potential for poverty alleviation, the potential to
influence development policy, and the potential for Danish business interests.
<p>
<a name="ins"><hr><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>
<p>
Danish official development assistance is based on the 1971 International Development Cooperation Act and
has since been laid down in many strategy and policy papers. Since 1990 the Danish Ministry of Foreign
Affairs has been divided into two separate pillars: a North Group and a South Group (the latter covering the
developing countries). Thus reflecting a geographical integration of all relevant international cooperation
components rather than the traditional functional one. DANIDA ceased to exist, although the name is still
used for the South group. The regional sub-divisions in the two groups are responsible for all aspects of
Denmark's bilateral relations with a given country: political, aid, economic, and commercial relations. Since
the beginning of 1993, the Ministry is not only headed by a Minister of Foreign Affairs but also by a
Minister for Development Cooperation. The Minister of Foreign Affairs is responsible for EU policies,
including EU development aid policies. The administration is not only responsible for policy formulation,
but also for implementation. 
<p>
Within the South Group in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a Division for the General Coordination of
Development Assistance is responsible for policy planning. The Ministry of Finance also participates in the
formulation of Denmark's aid policy. Additionally, under the Environmental Framework arrangements have
been made with the Ministry of Environment for the policy development and funding of environmental
protection assistance to specific countries. It is not known wether these arrangements have been finalised,
nor into what detail. Priorities for the distribution and the use of the funds of all Danish international
cooperation will be worked out annually by a interministerial committee.
<p>
In March 1994 the new comprehensive strategy plan, A Developing World, Strategy for Danish
Development Policy towards the Year 2000, was presented and approved by Parliament. A summary is
translated into English. Sector, country and overall policy papers generally are published and translated into
English and made available to a wide public.
<p>
Evaluations are conducted frequently, on projects and programmes, themes and such components as NGO
development cooperation and on multilateral aid. Many evaluations are conducted by external consultants
and firms. Feedback to DANIDA's operational units is done through informal discussions. Since 1982 a
relatively small evaluation unit was created within DANIDA. Its autonomy has recently been strengthened.
Evaluation reports are being summarised and published in order to inform the Danish public.
<p>
<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>
<p>
There are two advisory bodies for development cooperation policies: the Council for International
Development Cooperation (R&#229;det), which focuses on policy and the Board for International
Development Cooperation (Styrelsen), that focuses on policies and projects. This is a very common structure
in Scandinavian countries. The members of both bodies are appointed by the Minister for Development
Cooperation. Council and Board have a common secretariat at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the person
of an official of the Policy Planning Division. The secretaryship of both Council and Board is a part time
occupation. Results of the discussions in the Council and the Board are not published.
<p>
Both Council and Board are established according to the 1971 International Development Act. The formal
mandate of the Council is to follow the Board's activities.
<p>
<h4>The Council for International Development Cooperation</h4>
<p>
The Council has 75 members, appointed for three year periods. They represent all sections in Danish society
that have an interest in development cooperation: representatives of church-organisations, industry and
agriculture, trade unions, the sciences, banking, development NGOs, ministries, as well as individual
experts on development cooperation, and members of Parliament.
<p>
In addition to following the Board's activities, the Council also is formally appointed to discuss the annual
budget before it is sent to Parliament. Furthermore the Council discusses policy plans in their final stage
before they are sent to Parliament, and it reviews development activities on the basis of the formulated
policies. The 1994 Strategy Plan for the Year 2000 for instance was discussed with the Council before it
was officially published and sent to Parliament.
<p>
The Council meets about six times a year, of which one meeting is spent on discussing the annual report of
the Board, and another on discussing the annual budget for development cooperation. The Council is a body
for consultation, that discusses policy matters with the Minister; it does not write recommendations.
Council-meetings are chaired by the Minster for Development Cooperation. The press can be present at
these meetings. Amongst other things, the Council appears to function as a platform for discussion with all
parties involved in development cooperation. 
<p>
<h4>The Board for International Development Cooperation</h4>
<p>
The Board has nine members, appointed for three year periods. Members are representatives of the private
sector, business, industry, and consultancy, as well as representatives of NGOs, and the research
community. They are appointed on the basis of their personal capacity.
<p>
The mandate of the Board is to assess those projects and programmes of DANIDA that exceed 5 million
Danish Krona. Additionally it discusses development cooperation policies, in a similar way as the Council
does. Like the Council, the Board receives policy plans in their final stage before they are sent to
Parliament. The Board meets at least once a month. It cannot take up subjects at its own initiative.
Otherwise than the Council, the Board appears to be quite involved in the internal administrative process of
handling aid projects and programmes. 
<p>
Parliament has a standing Committee for Foreign Affairs that also deals with development cooperation
matters. Parliament as well as the Committee are very actively involved in development cooperation.
<p>
Until the beginning of the 1990s a Nordic Council of the Ministers of Development Cooperation of
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden met bi-annually to discuss policy issues. Adjacent to these
meetings advisory meetings were organised of parliamentarians and researchers from the five countries. One
of these advisory meetings was a seminar Human Rights and Democracy held in Helsinki. The proceedings
were published in English. It is not known whether these meetings will be continued.
<p>
<HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>
<p>
In 1992 almost 20 per cent of the Danish bilateral programme was disbursed through NGOs. The eight
largest organisations received 86 per cent. The Ministry maintains an active policy dialogue with the NGO-
community, amongst others on the increasing involvement of Danish Industry, the financing of the reception
of refugees in Denmark and of increasing emergency aid. 
<p>
According to a 1991 OECD survey in Denmark ten institutes qualify as 'Development Research and
Training Institutes'. In 1969 Parliament established by act of law the Centre for Development Research
(CDR), based in Copenhagen. It is an independent institute financed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The
Centre undertakes many consultancy studies and research work for the Ministry. 
<p>
Denmark also has a Research Council. It advises the Evaluation and Research Department of the South
Group in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on research and evaluation. The Council has 15 members who are
appointed for a two year period. 
<p>
The Danish business community will become increasingly involved in the formulation of development
strategies and the identification of programmes amongst others through annual meetings with DANIDA.

</h5><p>
<hr>
<p>
Poverty reduction has always been an overall objective of Danish development aid. And -as mentioned by the Minister - it will continue to be so in the new development strategy soon to be presented to Parliament. As part of this strategy poverty reduction will rest on three pillars, two of which are identical to the new poverty reduction agenda of the World Bank (economic growth and social sector development). A third &quot;pillar&quot; has been included in the Danish poverty reduction strategy : promotion of public participation in the development process, establishment of a constitutional society and good governance as a procondition for a stable economic, social and political development. <P>
	For good reasons I cannot share with you how the new strategy will be operationalized. A working group has been set up to prepare operational guidelines for poverty reduction.<P>
<P>
Before sharing with you how Danida has been working with poverty reduction untill now I find it important to place Danish development aid in its proper perspective.<P>
 <P>
The Danish development aid budget has increased during the 80'es. We reached the target of 1% of our BNI in 1992 equal to 8.262 mio. D.kr. A decision has been taken by the Danish Parliament to increase the aid budget with 0.5% of the BNI between now and the year 2002. The 0.5% increase will cover the expected growing demand for humanitarian aid and cost of handling refugees and it will be used for environment as a follow-up of Agenda 21 from UNCED.<P>
<P>
Approximately 50% of our aid budget is spent on multilateral aid, the remaining 50% on bilateral aid. The bilateral aid is distributed on a number of countries. From each recipient country's point of view Danish aid makes up a fraction of the aid to that country. Obviously there is a limit to the impact of only one donor`s aid on reducing poverty in a given country. <P>
	Danida, therefore, finds it important to encourage coordinated efforts of all donors to a given country for promotion of poverty reduction. <P>
	It should also here be mentioned that aid alone will not do the magic. There is a need to develop and implement a more coherent policy which combines reduction of the debt burden and improvements in trade-relations for the poor developing countries with development aid.<P>
<P>
This being said, let me briefly share with you what Danida has been doing for poverty reduction in its bilateral aid programmes:<P>
<P>
Danida has been using various instruments, tools and approaches. The most important are 1) different macro-economic instruments, 2) targetting the aid, 3) promoting access and 4) applying participatory methods. <P>
<P>
First to the different macro-economic instruments. Danida has contributed to relief of the debt burden and provided balance of payment support to countries in Sub Saharan Africa. An increasing share of the bilateral aid budget is used for these forms of programme aid. To assess the impact of these instruments Danida takes part in the ongoing international dialogue and has a seat in the various working groups set up by the World Bank under SPA. <P>
<P>
Now to examples of targetting the aid for poverty reduction. The BNI is being used to select programme countries. All the present 18 programme countries for Danish aid belong to the least developed countries with a BNI of below 1795 US $ per year.<P>
<P>
Within programme countries Danish aid is generally being used for development in <I>rural areas</I>. This is where the majority of the poor people has been and are still living. Targetting aid to the rural areas aims at uplifting these areas and reducing migration from rural to urban areas. <P>
<P>
Furthermore <I>poor, underdeveloped</I> and <I>hard hit districts or regions</I> have been chosen for Danish aid. I can mention as examples Upper Egypt in Egypt, Madhya Pradesh in India, Rakai in Uganda, Noakhali in Bangladesh. However, targetting underdeveloped geographical areas does not in itself ensure that aid programmes to these areas will automatically directly benefit the poor part of the population of these areas.<P>
<P>
Targetting is also used in <I>choosing sectors</I> for Danish aid. Approximately 30% of Danish bilateral aid goes to the socalled <I>social sectors:</I> health, education, and drinking water and sanitation. It should be mentioned that aid to the education sector has increased considerably during the last 4-5 years.<P>
	Another rapidly growing &quot;sector&quot; is democracy,human rights,and good governance.<P>
	But again, allocating development aid to a certain sector in itself does not imply that the poor automatically will have access to services provided by that sector, or that the benefits from allocations to the social sectors automatically will trickle down to the poor part of the population.<P>
<P>
At the <I>micro-level</I> - that is at the project-level - Danida is targetting its aid to <I>specified target groups</I>. In a number of projects the target group will be the poor part of the population of a given area. As examples I can mention agricultural extension service for small scale farmers and for women farmers, fish-ponds for landless rural people, labour intensive road maintenance schemes, where landless people and rural poor women and men are getting employment, credit schemes for rural poor.<P>
<P>
We are aware that <I>access</I> of poor people to decision making fora and to participation in and benefits from development programmes more often than not are hampered by a variety of different constraints. We have applied various instruments to promote access. As examples I can mention that we have used <I>cross-subsidization</I> when setting tarifs in water-projects in an effort to combine financial sustainability of the water utility with affordability of safe drinking waterfor the poor. In programmes where demands have been high for individual water connections or individual telephone connections Danida has taken steps to ensure access to these facilities for people who could not afford the individual connections by installing <I>public</I> water taps and <I>public</I> pay-phones. When constructing rural health centres in India efforts have gone into a selection of sites which are accessible also to the harijans and low-caste poor people of the area. <P>
<P>
Furthermore, Danida has applied <I>methods of participation</I> of the identified target-group of poor people in a given locality in problem-identification, need-assessment , planning and implementation in several projects. Time does not allow me to go into details.I can just briefly mention various women's projects, drinking water and soil and water conservation projects and some of the health projects as examples of projects where we have progressed more in applying participating methods. <P>
<P>
Through these approaches to poverty reduction Danida has gained some useful experience from its bilateral aid programmes. Some of these experiences have been applied in our dialogue with multilateral organizations receiving Danish support.<P>
<P>
But we still have a long way to go. One can argue - and I would say rightly so - that poverty reduction efforts of Danida have been somehow &quot;fragmented&quot;. There has not yet been a coherent poverty reduction strategy for Danish aid to a given programme- country.<P>
<P>
We have also not yet focussed evaluations on the poverty reducing impact of Danish supported programmes and projects. In the absence of measuring results we have unfortunately not even had time to document the processes initiated by us to reduce poverty of selected groups of poor people. Processes which we might even learn more from, than from measuring results.<P>
<P>
Finally, <I>if</I> we are on the right track with the economic instruments we apply and the economic development we support, we certainly do lack behind in our dialogue on the social development and in identifiying the social institutions to be established or strengthened to support poverty reduction.<P>
<P>
In our poverty reducing efforts we are faced with a number of challenges. One of them has to do with the fact that poverty reduction is only one out of various and to some extent contradictory objectives for Danish development aid. Others have to do with various paradoxes imbedded in providing aid. These challenges and paradoxes have not yet really caught the interest of researchers .It is , therefore, interesting to place them on the researchers' table today and see what answers researchers have. As I know that Gunilla Olsson will present the paradoxes which are quite similar for Danish and Swedish aid I will leave the floor for Gunilla to take us from here.

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of British Development Cooperation</h3>

Official British development cooperation, which started in the early 1960s, was based on the United
Kingdom's (UK) colonial legacy and a strong charitable ethic under the population. Already in the 1940s
and 1950s development approaches (in technical assistance and financial aid) for British overseas territories
evolved (amongst others the 1950 Commonwealth Plan of Colombo). In 1961 a first development
administration was created. Public support has always been strong, based on church and voluntary activities.
Well-known international NGOs, such as the Save the Children Fund and Oxfam respectively started in
1919 after World War I and as a response to the Greek famine in 1942. Opinion polls show that the British
public feels that development cooperation should not be left to voluntary organisations only, and that
government efforts could be enhanced.
<p>
In 1992 UK's net official development assistance amounted to US $ 3 217 million, which was 0.31 per cent
GNP, a fall of 3.5 per cent since 1991. The ODA/GNP ratio reached its peak in 1979 with 0.51 per cent,
and then steadily fell to 0.27 per cent in 1990, due to the UK's negative annual growth rate. Within a
growing budget for external assistance programmes for the period 1994 - 1996, the financial volume for aid
programmes to developing countries will remain unchanged (in current terms). 47 per cent of British ODA
in 1992 was disbursed through multilateral channels, of which 21 per cent through the EU. Multilateral
contributions, in the 1980s amounting to around 40 per cent of all British aid, could approach two-thirds of
the aid budget in the late 1990s, including one-third for the EU budget. After 1996 the budget for the
developing countries will not be separately identified in the overall external assistance budget, as it is
currently. The total external assistance budget includes now: aid to developing countries, aid to Central and
Eastern European Countries (CEECs), the former Soviet Union, and Global Environmental Assistance. 
<p>
<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>
<p>
British aid has its legislative basis in the Overseas Development and Cooperation Act of 1980, which
succeeded the 1966 Overseas Aid Act. All expenditures for development assistance must be authorised by
Parliament in additional legislation. With the establishment of the Department for Technical Cooperation in
1961 all Third World expertise, spread over several Ministries, was concentrated in one organisation. Since
then, many changes and reorganisations of the development administration have been implemented (1964,
1970, 1974, 1979), strongly influenced by the UK's changes of Government.
<p>
Since 1979, aid is administered by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA). A Minister for
Development Cooperation, who holds the position of Foreign and Commonwealth Minister of State, heads
the Overseas Development Administration and is under responsibility of the Foreign Secretary. The ODA is
located within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). It manages the three components of the British
external assistance programme: global environmental assistance, overseas aid to developing countries (the
main component), and assistance to Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union (managed
jointly with the Diplomatic Wing). The latter two are to merge after 1996. ODA is responsible for
multilateral aid, including contributions to the World Bank group and the EU.  
<p>
ODA is responsible for policy formulation and implementation. Actual implementation is delegated to
various types of institutions. Six Development Divisions play an important role in planning and managing
bilateral aid; these are located in Kenya, Barbados, Malawi, Zambia, Thailand and Pretoria. In addition
there are two Aid Management Offices (in Dhaka and the Pacific Islands). Staff based in Embassies and
High Commissions in Commonwealth countries assist in administering aid programmes. The Natural
Resource Institute (NRI), the scientific arm of British aid, conducts research, consultancies and evaluations.
The NRI is part of the aid administration and is directly responsible to the Minister for Development
Cooperation. The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), a government funded public
corporation, is the main instrument for assisting the private sector in developing countries. Crown Agents
for Overseas Governments and Administration provide procurement and management services to
governments of developing countries, to the UK and other donors. In formulation, implementation and
evaluation of development policy, the Government cooperates with NGOs, research institutes and private
enterprise. 
<p>
Allocations of responsibility, at ministerial as well as on administrative level, between the Aid
Administration on the one hand and the Foreign Policy Departments of the FCO and the Treasury on the
other, traditionally have been subjects of regular discussions. Various mechanisms for internal and external
coordination and consultation have been created, in order to achieve compromises between the above
mentioned organisations. British practice allows ministers to interfere in each other's affairs. The main
interministerial instrument for consultation and coordination of aid policy is the Joint Aid Policy Committee
(JAPC). This Committee includes representatives of ODA, the Diplomatic Wing of the FCO, the Treasury,
the Bank of England, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), and the Export Credit Guarantee
Department (ECGD).
<p>
The Aid Policy Department within the Finance Division of the ODA is the central section for policy
planning within the FCO. As in the Aid Policy Department, officials from ODA and the Diplomatic Wing
take counsel in the Aid Policy Board and the Aid Policy Management Group. Policy planning for
development cooperation of the EU is done by the European Community and Food Aid Department in the
International Division of the ODA. In addition the Prime Minister may install Sub-committees.
<p>
Over the years several White Papers (1963, 1975) have been formulated by the Government. In 1975 the
white paper on development cooperation, More Help for the Poorest, was published, on which current
British aid objectives are based. After UNCED, the Strategy for Sustainable Development was published,
with which all development strategies forthwith have to be consistent. Policy objectives are further
elaborated in Sector Policy Papers, in Country Objective Papers and Country Review Papers, commitment
targets, strategy papers for technology development and transfer, and corporate plans. Programmes are
considerably scrutinised and regularly evaluated, amongst others by the independently operating Evaluation
Department of the ODA. Some of these documents are published.
<p>
<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>
<p>
In the UK there was never felt a need for a formally organised advisory body for development cooperation.
Firstly, over the years a large network of officials and experts developed. Within this network the function
of an advisory body seems to be 
accounted for. Secondly, the Overseas Development Administration has a large number of professional
advisors and sector specialists. Additionally, the Minister and the administration have regular formal
contacts with a wide range of NGOs and academic institutions in the UK. In the United Kingdom a wealth
of knowledge and experience on development cooperation is made available through its many institutes. In
fact, it were renowned economists at British Universities - and in ODA - that since the 1960s elaborated
development theory and strategies.
<p>
The annual external assistance budget is submitted to Parliament and actively discussed as an integral part of
the total government budget. Several Standing Committees, such as the Standing Committee on Foreign
Affairs, the Estimates Committee, and Select Committees scrutinise government proposals. The House of
Lords as well as the House of Commons regularly publish extensive reports and studies on development
cooperation issues.
<p>
In order to be better informed, back-benchers in Parliament have organised themselves separately from the
existing Committee on Foreign Affairs, in an All Party Parliamentarian Group on Overseas Development
(APPGOOD) in 1984. The group has contacts with researchers and other experts and occasionally organises
meetings and seminars.
<p>
<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>
<p>
Among the research and development institutes the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) and the Institute
for Development Studies (IDS) are considered as the leading institutes, in particular on 'European issues'.
Publications of this institutes are widely available. The Intermediate Technology Development Group
(ITDG) is one of the leading institutes in development and transfer of technology. According to the 1991
OECD/EADI survey a total of 71 institutes qualifies as Development Research and Training Institutes.
<p>
Following the publication of the National Strategy for Sustainable Development, the Government announced
to set up a three level consultation structure in the UK for the continuation of the UNCED-process: a
Citizens Council, an informal Round Table Group, and an Advisory Panel to the Government, consisting of
eminent members of society.
<p>
The NGO development community in the UK, of which many started as church-based organisations, is one
of the strongest and oldest in Europe. NGOs in Britain actively search the policy dialogue with the
government, and vice versa. Working through NGOs is one of the fastest growing aspects of the British aid
programme. Of the approximately 300 British NGOs 100 receive government support (1992). Four large
NGOs cooperate with the Government in the British Voluntary Service Programme for personnel assistance
overseas. In 1993 an umbrella organisation was created: British Overseas NGOs for Development (BOND),
in which some 80 NGOs are represented. BOND was purposely created to encourage policy discussions,
coordination, to create a two way flow of information between the ODA and the NGOs, and to intensify
government cooperation with NGOs. Other NGO umbrella organisations for lobbying on aid policy issues
are a.o. the Human Rights and Development Forum, the National Association of Womens Organisations and
the Aid and Environment Group.
<p>
Topics of concern of the NGOs in the discussion with the Government are a.o. maintaining the UK's
volume for ODA, commercialisation of aid, the growing volume required for emergency aid, and
availability of operational information on government programmes.

<a name="com"><hr><h2><i>Complementarity between the development policies and actions of the Union and of its member states</i></h2></a>
<ol>
<li><b>Development Council Meeting of June 1995</b><br>
The resolution adopted in the follow-up to "Horizon2000" aims at increasing the efficiency
of coordination mechanisms already in place. Ministers stressed the importance of increasing
complementarity for the effectiveness of Member States and Community policies, and
recognised that such complementarity was in no way a threat for national policies.
<ul>
<li>The Resolution of December 1993 will therefore be put into place. Actions required include: 
<li>defining joint sectoral guidelines where necessary; 
<li>holding meetings of experts on sectoral policies; 
<li>testing operational coordination in developing countries; 
<li>coordination at international conferences and meetings. 
</ul><p>
Together with this, regular meetings of Director-Generals for informal discussion of questions
of common interest and follow-up to the coordination and complementarity process will be
implemented.More attention should be given to decentralising the decision-making process at
local level for certain categories of project and programme. The likelihood that co-financing instruments between the Community and the Member States
may assist the complementarity objective should be further studied. 
<p>
Improved coordination should also apply to the aid programming process. Formulating NIPs
for ACP countries and country strategies for the ALA and MED countries should be seen as
an opportunity for a joint examination of the actions of the Community.

</ol>
<p>

<a name="hum"><hr><h2><i>Human Rights</i></h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Development Council Meeting of June 1995</b><br>

The Council adopted a standard clause that will allow the Union to suspend agreements
concluded with third countries as soon as these countries violate human rights. Agreements
in future will include an article requiring the respect of democratic principles and fundamental
human rights as set out in the universal Declaration on Human Rights and the final Helsinki
Act and the Paris Charter. (At roughly the same time, however, the Council proposed to cut
EU budget lines destined for Human Rights work.) 

</ol>

<p>
<a name="reg"><hr><h2><i>Support for regional integration efforts by developing countries</i></h2></a>
<ol>
<li><b>Development Council Meeting of June 1995</b><br>
 

This resolution was taken against the background of the increasing number of initiatives aimed
at regional integration among developing countries.This includes the lowering of barriers to
improve the free movement of goods, services,capital and people.  The Council considers that
regional integration can help to create a favourable general framework provided that:
<ul> 
<li>the institutional framework is both stable and adaptable; 
<li>sufficient openness is maintained towards third countries; 
<li>suitable financial systems are available or are set up; 
<li>the private sector and civil society take an active part in the process of integration; 
<li>the costs and benefits of integration are shared out fairly. 
</ul>
<p>
Support for regional integration must be tailored to the requirements of the countries
concerned,and must not have the effect of discriminating against other countries in the same
region. Development cooperation policy must be based on: 
<ul>
<li>developing capabilities and strengthening institutions; 
<li>support for the private sector. 
</ul>
<p>
The Council notes that the existence of certain trade preferences may be a means of
supporting regional integration. Coordination needs to be stepped up between the Community
and the Member States, with consultation amongst them within international organisations
and at international conferences.
</ol>
<p>
<a name="str"><hr><h2><i>Structural Adjustment</i></h2></a>

<ol>
<li><b>Development Council Meeting of June 1995</b><br>
On the basis of two Commission documents, the first on Community support to structural
adjustment in ACP countries and the second a working document on this policy in the
southern and eastern Mediterranean countries, the Ministers adopted a resolution which puts
forward recommendations to the Commission. 
<p>
According to the resolution, particular attention should continue to be given to more
appropriate conditionality, local capacity for analysis and to taking account of the regional
dimension in the content of certain adjustment programmes. While setting out the improvements made due to the implementation of SAPs, the Council also draws attentions to the inadequacies of the present system. It invited the Commission:
<ul> 
<li>to continue to improve the budget process and maintain adequate levels of investment; 
<li>to ensure that temporary funding is provided for the transitional costs that may accompany
   the costs of placing programmes in a regional trade facilitation or economic integration
   framework;
<li>to assess the impact of the measures concerned on men and women; 
<li>to move from targeting counterpart funds towards more general allocation as soon as
   effective monitoring of the instruments has been achieved; 
<li>to increase the involvement of the States concerned in the monitoring of implementation; 
<li>to ensure greater coherence of Union action in implementing all the Community instruments; 
<li>to take account of external payment obligations when they have a lasting impact on poverty. 
</ul>
<p>
In conclusion, the Council stated that the Community should involve itself more effectively
and harmoniously in support of the structural adjustment process which remains one of the
most important instruments of development cooperation policy. 
</ol>

<a name="aid"><hr><h2><i>Development Council looks at new aid
budgets</i></h2></a>

The biannual Council of Development ministers, which was held on 20 December
1996, was largely taken up with discussion on the management procedures for new
Commission regulations on budget lines benefiting all developing countries. Hitherto,
there has been something of a legal vacuum in this area.
<p>
The Council was chaired by Spain's Minister of State for International Cooperation
and Latin America, Jose Luis Dicenta Ballester.
<p>
In keeping with the EU's policy on transparency, defined on July 17 1995, ministers
held a public debate in the morning on a new food aid security regulation involving
some ECU 500 million per annum. The regulation groups all existing provisions in a
single instrument and covers financing of new areas such as allocation of inputs,
seeds, stocking and rapid alert systems.
<p>
Projects such as support for food security, the setting up of alert systems to identify
risks such as drought, and stocking programmes designed to avert crises in certain
countries that suffer structural food shortages, are eligible to receive funds. These
include the possibility of direct support to the private sector.
<p>
Ministers agreed that such aid should be integrated as fully as possible with the
development policies and food strategies of the countries concerned, without
negatively affecting local markets. The Commission can decide on projects costing
less than ECU 2 million: above this amount they still have to go to the Council of
Ministers for approval by the EU Member States.
<p>
Many ministers underlined that EU aid should not harm the interests of local
populations. 'Anyone who has been to Tanzania has to be struck by the (negative)
effects on the local population of massive international efforts', claimed Joan Burton,
Ireland's Secretary of State for overseas development aid.
<p>
Another text was adopted on the management of humanitarian aid under the auspices
of the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO). In 1994, this type of aid
reached ECU 765 million. From now on, ECHO itself can take decisions on projects
under 10 million ECU, without consulting Member States. 
<p>
The Council agreed on the management of an annual aid sum of ECU 125 million
(ECU 500m between 1995-1999) for South Africa - although the Commission did not
agree with the common position. This will now be forwarded to the European
Parliament under the cooperation procedure.
<p>
Member States were unable to reach agreement on rules concerning cofinancing with
NGOs and decentralised cooperation. A regulation on rehabilitation aid for developing
countries was accepted, although the Commission disagreed with its content. Any
project costing over 2 million ECU must be submitted for the approval of Member
States. And ministers moved closer towards consensus at the meeting on a regulation
on refugees in developing countries in Asia and Latin America. This budget line
covers self-sufficiency and re-integration of displaced persons.
<p>
Texts on the general principles of cooperation to be followed by the EU to promote
equality between the sexes, and on priorities to be given in EU aid to conserve
tropical forests in developing countries, under a four-year ECU 200 million programme
(1996-1999), were adopted.
<p>
The text dealing with tropical forests spells out what type of projects can be funded.
A point worth noting is that governments are not the only potential beneficiaries.
Decentralised bodies, regional organisations, public agencies, local and traditional
communities, private operators, cooperatives, NGOs and associations that are
involved in forest conservation and represent forest dwellers may also have access
to funds.
 
The EU is particularly keen to back projects which conserve or renew tropical forests,
contribute to sustainable development, encourage certification systems, help forest
dwellers with training, management and research, reinforce legal systems, encourage
conservation research projects, and create special conservation zones for forest
regeneration.
<p>
The development ministers also agreed on the text of a declaration concerning
Burundi which called for a Christmas cease-fire 'from December 24 to January with
the possibility of prolongation.' The Council recommended the appointment of a
special EU mediator to engage in dialogue with the refugee populations in Rwanda
and Burundi and their respective governments, as well as with neighbouring
countries.
<p>
There was also discussion of the European Commission's trade talks with  South
Africa which, it is hoped, will be concluded during 1996. Britain's overseas
development minister, Linda Chalker, remarked: 'It is important for us and other
European nations to have access to South Africa just as it is important for them to
have access to our market.'
<p>
<a name="wom"><hr><h2><i>Development Council discusses the
role of women</i></h2></a>
<p>
During the same session, the Development Council acknowledged - in a
resolution on sexual equality - that the elimination of current disparities
between women and men is an essential aspect of development from the
standpoints both of aid effectiveness and social justice.
<p>
The Council undertook to give priority to the participation of women in
development. This was one of the many undertakings made in Peking at
the World Conference on Women in September 1995, and followed the
Commission's recommendations on the subject.
<p>
The Ministers set out the general principles which must, in future, guide
the establishment of development cooperation. Integral to this is the 
notion of sexual equality, at the level of both the EU and its Member
States. The Council stressed that any measure should apply across the
board, both in the formulation of development policies and in negotiations
with partner countries.
<p>
It also called for 'positive action' aimed at ironing out disparities between
men and women. The important role of non-governmental organisations
in this area was emphasised and reference was made to the possibility
of support for women's organisations and networks.
<p>
In addition, the Council thought there was a need to strengthen the
Commission's and the Member States' internal capacities in these
matters. This would entail special training for personnel working in the
development field, priority integration of sex equality issues in
emergency, crisis prevention and poverty alleviation operations, and the
establishment of a monitoring system.
<p>
Finally, in calling for closer collaboration between the Community and the
Member States, the Council invited the Commission to undertake
collaborative actions with the Member States and to draft specific
proposals on common factors and criteria. The aim is for the Commission
to report on progress made in this area at a future Development Council
meeting.

<h3>Forests and EC Aid: an agenda for sustaining both trees and people<p>EC Aid and Sustainable Development Briefing Paper, No. 10, 1996</h3>



<I>Since 1992, international action aimed at improving forest management has accelerated. This Briefing Paper looks at forest problems and provides an outline of the policy framework and strategies for the EC’s development cooperation to forests</I>. 
<p>
<H3>Why are forests important?</H3>

Forests provide many benefits. Rural populations in many countries depend on forest resources for part of their livelihoods, and poorer people among them do so in particular. There are also national and international demands for forest goods and services such as watershed protection, timber and non-timber products, biological diversity and carbon storage. Forests thus have multiple values, many of which cannot be provided by any other land use. Yet these values are being undermined. 
 
<H3>What are the problems?</H3>

Forests everywhere are in trouble. Deforestation in tropical forests is calculated by the FAO to have proceeded throughout the 1980s at an average rate of 15 million hectares (0.8 percent of forest cover) a year. Millions of additional hectares were degraded by inappropriate logging practices and fuelwood collection. Temperate forests are seriously degraded by pollution and over-harvesting. Whilst these immediate effects are on trees, the problems caused are for people. Globally, the main physical forest problems are:
<ul>
<li>Declining quantity and quality of forests. This is because wood, fuel and food are being harvested at rates faster than forest regeneration; because remaining growing stock is often poorly managed; and because many forests are being cleared to make way for other land uses.
<p>
<li>Environmental degradation of forest areas. Forest exploitation and clearance can create interlinked problems; notably soil erosion, watershed destabilisation and micro-climatic change. These threaten the soil and water base for agriculture. Industrial air pollution, particularly common in some temperate forests, also reduces forest health.
<p>
<li>Loss of biodiversity.These problems are contributing to a rapid reduction in ecosystem, species and genetic diversity. This lowers the world’s biological potential for improving material, food and medicine production. With tropical forests being perhaps the major repository of biodiversity, forest abuse in tropical regions is causing particular concern.
<p>
<li>Climate change. Forests play a major role in carbon storage. It is probable that the cumulative effect of global forest loss and environmental degradation will be a net contribution to regional and global climate change. This could bring many problematic side-effects: sea level rise, risks to food supply, declining productivity of soils and the quality and quantity of fresh water, inviability of current land uses and protected areas, and human health problems.
</ul>

<H3>Who are they problems for?</H3>

Replacement or alteration of forests by other land uses has produced economic and social benefits in many countries. In particular, the clearance of forest for agriculture has been deliberate and has been looked upon as advancing possibilities for development, either by increasing food security or providing cash crops to fuel income growth. Yet there are costs. The problem is that those who reap the benefits generally do not pay the costs. The main costs for people are:
<ul>
<li>Loss of cultural assets and knowledge. The culture and knowledge of many peoples, which are not always documented, and which have evolved through long periods of nurturing the forest, are diminishing as forest area, access, and traditional rights are reduced.
<p>
<li>Loss of livelihood. Forest loss and degradation are affecting the livelihoods of forest-dependent peoples - particularly poorer groups who may not have significant agricultural land, and who depend on forests for “social security”. 
<p>
<li>Rising inequality. Increasing concentration of control and access to forest wealth in fewer hands is removing development options for the majority of people in many countries. Those who lose their forest livelihoods and become marginalised may be forced to create social and economic problems elsewhere, such as in cities. 
</ul><p>
Each country, and each forest within it, may experience a different combination of forest-related problems. It is people in developing countries who bear the brunt of these problems.Yet the wasting of forest assets is occurring on an international scale, and the causes of forest problems are to be found at all levels: local, national and global.

<H3>What are the causes?</H3>

It is important to distinguish the direct agents from the underlying causes of forest problems. The direct agents which bring about problems for tropical forests include: slash-and-burn cultivation by small-scale farmers; settled agriculture and cash crop production; clearance and burning for grazing; timber harvesting; woodfuel harvesting; clearance for forest plantations; infrastructure construction (mining, dams, roads, etc).
<P>
Often, several factors work together. For example, road development encourages timber exploitation, which opens the forest for agricultural settlement and fuelwood salvaging. About half of all logged tropical forests are eventually cleared by farmers. The importance of these agents may differ according to regions. In Africa, the major agent of deforestation is shifting agriculture after timber harvesting; in Latin America, agriculture often precedes logging operations; in South-East Asia, logging may be the central agent of deforestation due to its intensity. 
<P>
The root causes of forest problems are more complex and entrenched. These are the policy, market and institutional “signals”, to which the direct agents of deforestation and forest degradation respond. Many signals arise at national level, either within the forestry  sector or outside - notably in agriculture and industrial development. Or they are a result of national macro-economic policies. Other signals are set at local levels, often due to fundamental inequities in rights and access to resources. Further signals are set internationally, such as trade policies, debt and structural adjustment requirements.
<P>
These signals either “push” groups into the forest, by creating difficult economic or social conditions outside the forest; or they “pull” groups into the forest, by attracting them with excess profits. Many policies and market conditions effectively undervalue forests, and do not provide long-term incentives for the groups “pushed” or “pulled” into forests to look after forest assets. 

<H3>Making the transition to sustainable forests</H3>

The challenge is to tackle the root causes of forest problems, and create the conditions that encourage the recognition, and management, of forest assets with multiple values. The transition to sustainable forest management requires action at international, national and local levels. Since the late 1980s, the EC and its Member States have made a number of internal and international commitments to support that transition in developing countries.

<H3>What are the EC’s international commitments?</H3>

During the 1980s the EC and Member States were heavily involved in development and support of two major international forestry initiatives: the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA) and the Tropical Forestry Action Programme (TFAP). Support has been given to a wide range of national initiatives within the TFAP framework.. 
<P>
The 1992 Rio Earth Summit produced a surge of forest-related commitments for the EC and its Member States, including the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, the Agenda 21 action programme, the Forest Principles, the Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the Convention on Biological Diversity. In 1994, the EC signed the Desertification Convention. 
<P>
The non-legally binding Forest Principles represent, for the first time, a global consensus on all forests, and not just those of the tropics. They constitute a political document, affirming general values. They call for sustainable forest management of all types of forest, with conservation and development being accorded equal importance. The Principles are not an operational plan, and need to be interpreted in conjunction with Agenda 21, notably Chapter 11 on Deforestation. 
<P>
The Biodiversity Convention requires large areas of forest to be set aside for conservation, and provides for benefit-sharing of any exploitation of forest biodiversity. The Climate Change Convention emphasises the value of carbon storage in existing forests, the sequestration of carbon in growing forests, and the dangers of deforestation. Various Joint Implementation schemes have followed, in which forest conservation and afforestation is paid for by power-generation utilities to offset some of the environmental costs of CO2 generation (see Briefing Paper No. 6 on Climate). The Desertification Convention calls for national action plans which recognise the importance of trees and local participation in addressing dryland degradation (see Briefing Papers <A HREF="bp4_gb.html">4</A> and <A HREF="bp5_gb.html">5</A>). 
<P>
In 1995, the Commission for Sustainable Development (CSD), set up following Rio to oversee implementation of Agenda 21, established an ad hoc Intergovernmental Panel on Forests, with the objective to promote multi-disciplinary action at the international level consistent with the Forest Principles. The EC and its Member States are involved in many discussion and negotiation processes which feed in to the Panel. The IPF is composed of government representatives, with inter-governmental and NGO groups as observers and will report to the CSD in 1997.
<P>
The second ITTA, came in to force at the beginning of 1996. All EU countries have indicated that they will ratify ITTA II, which calls for sustainable management of forests and trade from sustainable sources by the year 2000.  

<H3>The EC’s policy response</H3>

The Commission’s Communication to the Council of October 1989 on the conservation of tropical forests set out the main elements of an EC strategy in this field, while the May 1990 Development Council Resolution on tropical forests established a basis for the use of european development instruments in tropical forest conservation. The European Parliament has exerted continual pressure on the EC and Member States to provide more and better development assistance for tropical forests, and in 1991 the Budget Line for tropical forests was established. Conservation and sustainable forest management are also recurring themes in the new generation of bilateral and regional cooperation agreements with developing countries in Asia and Latin America (ALA). 
<p>
Two developments in late 1995 bring new commitments on tropical forests: 
<ul>
<li>The signing of the revised Fourth Lomé Convention with a Protocol on Sustainable Management of Forest Resources. Lomé IV identifies deforestation as a serious problem and points to the need for joint action. The Protocol establishes a number of priority areas for assistance including: biodiversity conservation, sustainable management of production forests, reafforestation, local capacity building and the development of buffer zones. Particular attention is given to the importance which timber products play in the economies of the ACP States.
<p>
<li>Adoption by the Council of the Regulation on Operations to Promote Tropical Forests. The Regulation includes priorities similar to the new Lomé Forests Protocol and provides a legal basis for the execution of the allocations of the Budget Line supporting initiatives in tropical forest areas.
</ul><p>
Following a concerted process of strategy development, the EC is currently preparing a new Communication to address the developments and changes of national and international emphasis since 1989. The following section outlines strategic areas likely to be reflected in the new Communication.

<A NAME="fig"><H3>How can the EC support developing countries?</H3></A>

Better management of forests should not wait for the outcome of debates around the world on what constitutes “sustainable forest management”. Neither should it wait for all framework conditions at country level to be present before taking action. What is needed in most countries is “sustainable-enough” forestry, which demands choosing what should be sustained - and for whom - and moving towards it through processes which identify and build on policies and practices that work. (<A HREF="fig10e.html">See Box 1</A>).
<p>
In programming and planning for EC development cooperation, the following main approaches should be considered:
<ul>
<li><I>Country-driven processes and wider involvement in decision-making</I>
Support is often needed for processes of country-specific planning for forests and land use. These include: identification of forest stakeholders and their perspectives; development of institutions, e.g. round tables or permanent commissions; and methodologies for reconciliation of competing claims and building consensus.
<p>
<li><I>Recognising capacity and building institutional options</I>
Potential capacity to deliver better forest management is often poorly recognised. Organisational options which build on negotiated roles for government and non-governmental sectors need support, as do forestry training approaches which produce a new kind of forester - one who can deal with the multiple dimensions of forests and can mediate between different stakeholder interests.
<p>
<li><I>Reorienting influences from outside the forestry sector</I>
Support is needed for activities which integrate inter-sectoral issues and try to ensure that better forest management is complemented by such influences as: macroeconomic policy; agricultural pricing and marketing; energy policies and forest land settlement schemes.
<p>
<li><I>Working policy processes and instruments</I>
Support is needed for processes and institutions which link policy with on-the-ground realities, and for analysis of market instruments, regulations and taxes which effectively communicate the scarcity and value of forest resources, and the full costs of forest use.
<p>
<li><I>Securing rights and devolving management</I>
Government departments often have theoretical control of a huge area of forest, but have few resources to manage it. Modes of support which secure the rights and promote the forest management abilities of farmers and forest communities are needed. These include collaborative approaches at local levels amongst government agencies, communities and the private sector.
<p>
<li><I>Complementary land uses</I>
Other land use systems can be used in achieving forestry objectives. The range of forest values can be spread over the forest and agricultural landscape through support for land use planning and sustainable agricultural systems at local level.
<p>
<li><I>Better operational management of forests</I>
Governments may need support for establishing a national permanent forest estate. This does not have to be all under government ownership, and assistance may be needed to allow negotiation of appropriate degrees of control by state and non-state actors. Natural forest management may be appropriate on previously logged or degraded forests, and priority of support should be given to community-based and controlled initiatives.
<p>
<li><I>Integrating biodiversity conservation with development</I>
In many countries, natural forests are limited in area and many should become “protection” forest. Yet protected areas are likely to remain viable only if they are supported within a broader integration of conservation with development. This may involve the linkage of protection areas to spatial and temporal zones for development of non-consumptive and sustainable consumptive enterprises. 
<p>
<li><I>Reforestation and on-farm trees</I>
Plantations are a complement to, not substitute for, natural forests. Support linked to plantation exercises should aim to secure social and environmental benefits through outgrower schemes, natural forests integrated in plantation mosaics, and multiple-species plantations. Support for trees in farming systems is usually best done through provision of advice, credit and infrastructure, with management and marketing decisions left to farmers. 
<p>
<li><I>Local processing, trading and forest certification </I>
Local processing initiatives based on timber from well-managed sources may be important to stimulate economic development and employment prospects. Support may also be needed for developing consensus on market-based incentives, including certification, which can provide both improved market security and raised standards of forest management if carefully developed.
<p>
<li><I>Making information and research more useful</I>
Information and research for better forest management has been weak in many countries, particularly at the policy, legal and institutional levels. Support is needed for a mix of good science, economics and participatory approaches to obtain and integrate information about forests and forest values with policy and planning cycles.
</ul><p>
The EC and its Member States have played major roles in international initiatives to combat deforestation and define what sustainable forest management entails. Europe has also traditionally  provided the largest aid flows in the field of forestry. The new agenda of broader participation in setting goals, of redefining roles, and of building on the forest management capacities of a wider range of players, is a challenge for which collaboration in Europe has great potential to address.
<p>
<I>This Briefing Paper was prepared by James Mayers, Research Associate in the Forestry and Land Use Programme of IIED. He has worked for 10 years on projects and policy processes which foster collaboration for forest management. The Forestry and Land Use Programme undertakes research with partners in developing countries on policy, capacity and information for sustainable forest management.</I>

<I>For the last 20 years, the international community has struggled to provide answers to an often misunderstood phenomenon known as ‘desertification’.  In October 1994, a new International Convention on Desertification (ICD) was signed.
<p>
This is the first in a series of briefings designed to stimulate reflection by European policymakers on the challenges and opportunities provided by the Convention.   Future briefings on the ICD could include: promoting participation in natural resource management; decentralisation and land tenure; climate change and desertification; national planning and programming; and European Union best practice in development cooperation on desertification and policy options
</I>. 
<p>
<H3>Introduction: Drylands and Desertification</H3>

Drylands make up a third of the world’s surface and provide a home to some 900 million people.  The cradle of ancient civilisations and at the hub of trading systems through the ages, they have also been the source of many valuable crops and animals. Dryland regions have always been subject to variable rainfall and drought, bringing years of plenty followed by years of want. Over the past two decades, there has been rising concern about longer term degradation in  dryland regions which would render them less able to support life in future. This degradation has been termed ‘desertification’.
<p>
Desertification includes a range of problems, such as loss of soils through water and wind erosion; declining soil fertility; a loss of vegetative cover; increasing vulnerability to drought; and a general reduction in the diversity of plant and animal life.  Set against this vulnerability to degradation, drylands systems are also recognised as being remarkably resilient to wide extremes in rainfall and resource use.  
<p>
The incidence of dryland degradation and of resilience varies greatly from place to place, according to the nature of the resources in question, pressures on their use, and institutions for their management.  This local variability is the reason why new approaches to combatting desertification are focused strongly at the local level.  
<p>
As will be explained below, desertification is not about advancing deserts.  While sand dune movement can pose a problem in certain sites, the main threat faced by dryland regions is not at the desert margin but in farming areas where heavy pressures on land can lead to the progressive decline in productive potential.

<H3>The ICD: a new start?</H3>

Over the past 20 years, international efforts to tackle the problems of desertification have had mixed success.  Following the UN Conference on Desertification, held in Nairobi 1977,  a number of plans of action to combat desertification were established at national and regional levels.  However, these plans had little or no impact on the ground, and were often no more than a list of projects seeking funds.  It is now recognised that successful dryland management depends on providing local land users with incentives and firm rights over their resources. Getting national policy right is much more important than preparing detailed plans that will not be implemented.  Hence, the ICD suggests a number of policy changes needed to achieve more sustainable resource use, such as increased security of land tenure.

<H3>Negotiating a Global Convention</H3>

The International Convention to combat Desertification was first proposed during the preparatory committees for the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), held in Rio, June 1992.  The call for the Convention evolved from the dissatisfaction felt by many African countries at the way in which their particular concerns had been treated during preparations for UNCED.  As a result, a formal commitment was made at Rio to negotiate and agree a Global Convention to combat Desertification by June 1994.  While global in scope and intention, it was acknowledged that particular attention would need to be paid to Africa, because of the poverty of many dryland African countries and lack of alternative livelihoods for their peoples.

<p>
These agreements are legally binding.  Signatories cede power to an international body, allowing the monitoring of actions covered by the agreement, and the imposition of sanctions should the conditions of the agreement not be met.
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
After five sessions of the International Negotiating Committee, the Convention text was agreed in June 1994, along with four regional annexes, a resolution on urgent action for Africa, and a resolution on the interim period prior to the ICD’s entry in force.  The Convention was signed in Paris in October 1994 by over 80 states, including 13 of the 15 Member States of the newly expanded EU, as well as the European Community.  
<p>
The interim period will last from June 1994 until the first meeting of the conference of the parties, probably some time in early 1997.  The reason for this interim period of two to three years is due to the time taken for national governments to ratify their adherence to the convention by passing legislation through their national parliaments.  A minimum of fifty such ratifications is needed for the ICD to enter into force.  The first COP will be held six months after the fiftieth ratification of the Convention is notified to the UN.
<p>
During the interim period, it is planned to hold several meetings bringing together representatives of national governments and international agencies.  It is unclear what agenda such meetings will follow, given that the negotiations of the ICD were completed in June 1994.  The first of these interim meetings was held in January 1995 in New York, the second in August 1995 in Nairobi, and the next is scheduled for early 1996.

<H3>Desertification or dryland degradation? </H3>

The term ‘desertification’ has had a troubled history, and has acquired a range of meanings that have served to confuse discussion of what is at stake. Desertification was defined at the Rio Earth Summit as:
<ul>
<I>land degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas resulting from climatic variations and human activities</I>
</ul><p>
Hence, desertification means dryland degradation, and they both include a number of processes which lead to the impoverishment of soils and vegetation, such as through erosion of soils, and loss of soil fertility.  Both human and climatic factors are important in such degradation processes, the long dry season and occasional droughts rendering more difficult the recovery of dryland ecosystems.  
<p>
<center>
<table border=1 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><center><h4>The Convention Document</h4></center>
<p>
The main Convention text is made up of 40 articles spread across 32 pages.  Six main sections cover:<ul><li>Introduction and definitions (Articles 1-3)<li>General obligations of different parties, the priority given to Africa, and the ICD’s relationship to other conventions (Articles 4-8)<li>Action programmes, scientific and technical cooperation and supporting measures, including financial provisions and mechanisms (Articles 9-21)<li>Institutions for implementing the convention (Articles 22-25)<li>Procedures for implementation, settlement of disputes, amendments, and voting rights (Articles 26-32)<li>Final provisions, concerning signature, ratification, entry into force and withdrawals (Articles 33-40)</ul><p>There are four regional annexes of varying length and complexity treating: Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the northern Mediterranean region. The African annex provides detailed guidance on preparation of programmes of action to combat desertification (at national, sub-regional, and regional levels), and coordination mechanisms to ensure greater collaboration between donors, NGOs, governmental structures and local community organisations.  The other three regional annexes are much briefer.<p>The Resolution on Urgent Action for Africa, agreed in June 1994, encourages governments to begin implementing the ICD immediately, even though ratification of the Convention is still a couple of years away.  Amongst the measures proposed within the resolution are the following:<ul><li>all countries to disseminate information about the Convention, to promote public awareness about the ICD and the actions to which different parties are now committed<li>affected country governments to start preparing National Action Programmes to combat Desertification, building on existing plans where possible.<li>developed countries to support the preparation of NAPs, establishment of partnership arrangements, and specific measures identified within such programmes.</ul><p>The Resolution on interim arrangements sets out the necessary measures to enable work to continue on the ICD, continuing the mandate of the interim Secretariat until the first COP and  making provision for the 6th meeting of the negotiating committee to be held in January 1995.<p>The Secretariat remains an independent entity for the time being, based in Geneva, and with the task of making arrangements for meetings, compiling and transmitting reports submitted to it, and facilitating urgent action for Africa.<p>The committee on science and technology will be established by the COP and will be composed of government representatives competent in the various fields relevant to desertification.  At the same time, the COP will set up an independent roster of experts, to be called upon for work on specific topics.

<p>
Many people prefer to use the term dryland degradation, since it is less liable to mislead.  ‘Desertification’ conjures up in the mind an image of an advancing desert, whose progress must be halted by establishing a physical barrier, such as a belt of trees.  Despite the popular image of an advancing desert, there is no evidence for this happening.  Instead, the desert frontier shifts over time, depending on the rainfall received that year.  In a drought year such as 1984, the desert advances as plants fail to germinate and others die, while in a year of heavy rainfall, such as 1988 and 1994, the desert retreats, as grasses and shrubs re-establish themselves.  There are localised problems of sand dune movement which need to be tackled where this threatens a village, road, or waterway.  However, compared with the progressive decline in the potential of dryland farming areas, sand dune encroachment is of far less significance in terms of people affected, and the costs of lost productivity.

<H3>What is the real problem?  </H3>

Figures on rates of desertification are hard to come by.  In the past, the UN Environment Programme has tried to put together data on the incidence and severity of desertification at regional and global levels.  However, it is widely admitted that the data are extremely poor.  Little or no data exist from which to measure trends in degradation over a reasonable stretch of time.  Instead, we have to rely on proxy measures, such as crop yields, to estimate trends in underlying productivity.  However, crop yields are clearly strongly determined by a range of other factors - amount and timing of rainfall, labour spent weeding, pest attacks, and so on - which means they are not very useful for measuring rates of degradation.  The underlying causes of dryland degradation vary:<ul>
<li>At <I>field level</I>, baring of soils through ploughing,  lack of measures to conserve soils;
<li>At <I>village or district level</I>, pressure on land available for cultivation, absence of technical support, lack of credit;
<li>At <I>national level</I>, poor security of tenure over land and water, policy bias towards urban populations, few alternative employment opportunities; and
<li>At <I>international level</I>, high levels of debt, weak prices for export crops.</ul>

<H3>A local level approach</H3>

While national and regional action plans have brought little progress for ordinary people, at local level numerous successful examples of dryland development exist.  These successes tend to involve a number of common elements such as working in collaboration with local people and helping them to build on their skills according to their priorities. The intention of the ICD is to replicate such success stories more widely by requiring that the various parties involved change their way of doing business.  In general terms, the ICD sets out a code of good practice for national governments, bilateral donors, multilateral agencies, and non-governmental organisations, which tries to build on more promising approaches to drylands development.
<p>
<center>
<table border=1 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><center><h4>Lessons from Past Experience</h4></center>
<p>
An increasing body of project experience now demonstrates the importance of certain factors.  Successful projects tend to:<ul><li>adopt a flexible, learning process approach, which allows projects to change course as circumstances change<li>build on local skills<li>place highest priority on local people’s needs<li>provide secure rights over resources to poor people, and significant benefits<li>depend on well-trained and motivated staff, who are committed to working alongside poor people, often in harsh conditions.</ul>
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>

<H3>What will the Convention mean in practice?</H3>

The ICD contains a host of highly challenging commitments for both affected countries and developed country donors, such as the EU (see box).  If followed, the commitments would have far-reaching implications for the exercise of power, allocation of resources, and decision-making process in these countries.
<p>
<center>
<table border=1 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><center><h4>The Convention Commitments</h4></center>
<p>
“<I>Signatory governments of affected countries promise to provide an enabling environment ... facilitate the participation of local populations ... encourage initiatives and the assumption of responsibility by local communities. ... and provide secure tenure for local populations.<p>Developed country signatories undertake to actively support the efforts of affected countries ... provide substantial resources..... avoid duplication..... facilitate access to appropriate technology .... strengthen capacities... and develop an informal process of consultation and coordination among themselves</I>”.
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
The Desertification Convention provides an important opportunity for governments of affected countries to consolidate donor support for drylands development.  It is essential that they seize this opportunity and demonstrate their desire to follow the commitments made under the Convention.  While the main initiative needs to remain in the hands of national governments, <I>donor agencies have a vitally important role to play, in encouraging a flexible, process-led approach, and demonstrating a willingness to pool interests and resources in support of the national government’s agenda</I>.
<p>
Ultimately, however, action by national governments and donors will be useless unless it sets a general framework within which local people - herders, farmers - are encouraged to act.  The commitments under the ICD are designed to facilitate action by land users, by strengthening their ability and motivation to tackle dryland degradation.   But local people will only have an interest in making long term investments where they have secure rights to their land, and where they can see clear benefits from such activities.
<p>
The central commitment within the ICD is preparation of National Action Programmes to combat desertification, building on existing environmental plans and strategies where possible.  Such programmes are meant to:<ul> 
<li>be prepared in a consultative and participatory fashion 
<li>emphasize integrated local development programmes 
<li>propose a range of actions needed to strengthen capacity within decentralised structures, and
<li>promote education and training for local populations.
</ul><p>
<H3>Making planning work</H3>

While the ICD text provides a challenging series of commitments, phrased in excellent rhetoric, careful thought is needed to ensure that such rhetoric is carried through into practice.  A close look at past experience shows that many a well-laid plan brings poor results, for a variety of reasons.  These include: 
<ul>
<li>competition amongst donors and their respective plans, programmes, and strategies; 
<li>institutional wrangling between ministries over which will be responsible and therefore receive funds; 
<li>lack of interest in and ownership of such environmental plans by recipient governments; and 
<li>no attention paid to involving local people and organisations in formulating programmes and policies.</ul>
<p>
If the Desertification Convention is to bear fruit, the governments of affected countries must be convinced of the need for National Action Plans, and their preparation through consultation and participation.  This will only happen if governments, donors, NGOs, and ordinary people have more information about the Convention and the opportunities presented by this agreement.
<p>
Important questions remain concerning the implementation of the Desertification Convention.  These questions include:
<ul>
<li>What is meant by a participatory planning process? Who needs to participate and how? Does it matter?
<li>How will National Action Plans to combat Desertification be integrated into the other planning initiatives currently under way, such as National Conservation Strategies, Forestry Action Plans, and National Environmental Action Plans?
<li>What linkages exist between climate change and desertification?
<li>How important are technical issues, as opposed to socio-economic factors in combatting desertification?  Why are land tenure and decentralisation such central elements within the Convention?
</ul><p>
<H3>Finding the EU role</H3>

The EC and its Member States have historically been the largest source of development finance to combat desertification, particularly in Africa.   It is now almost ten years since the launch of the European Action Plan to Combat Desertification.   The ICD provides a challenging strategic agenda for how the Community could support the sustainable management of drylands, particularly in the next phase of the Lomé Convention.  European policymakers now need to assess the implications of the ICD for future aid programming.

<I>The international Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD) lays out an impressive agenda of action for developing countries and donor agencies.   This second Briefing Paper on the Convention examines what it could mean on the ground and points to lessons from the past from implementing soil and water conservation projects</I>. 
<p>
<H3>Implementing the Convention</H3>

The CCD contains a number of key themes for tackling the growing problem of dryland degradation in developing countries.  As the text says, attention will be paid to:
<ul>
<li>achieving effective participation by both women and men at local, regional and national levels, including farmers and pastoralists and their representative organisations in policy planning, decision-making, implementation and review of national action programmes;
<p>
<li>realising increased flexibility in project design, funding and implementation, in keeping with the experimental, iterative approach that is needed for particpatory action at the local community level;
<p>
<li>encouraging a policy of active decentralisation as well as the assumption of responsibility by local communities; and
<p>
<li>adjusting the institutional and regulatory framework of natural resource management to provide security of tenure for local populations.
</ul><p>
The issue now for developing countries and donors is to translate these aspirations into action.  The UN Conference Halls are a long way from the hot and dusty field of a farmer in the Sahel.  So, will the commitments made by government delegates bring any real changes on the ground? And what can we do to try and make it happen?
<p>
Here, we tackle 12 of the most important questions to be answered.

<H4>1. What does desertification really mean?</H4>

Desertification is seen by many as desert advance. But this represents only a fraction of the problem. The greatest threat to the livelihoods of farmers and pastoralists in developing countries is the degradation of land often hundreds of kilometres away from any desert. Consequently, measures to combat deserti-fication are those that improve the stability and productivity of dryland farming and pastoral systems, within a context of great  climatic, economic and institutional variability.  This means taking action to conserve soil and water resources, improve soil fertility and develop better grazing management practices.

<H4>2. What is new about the Convention ?</H4>

The Convention represents a culmination of thinking and practice over many years. Experience has shown that farmers need more secure tenure rights over their land, and that it makes sense to involve local people in planning projects. It is also clear that donors can act in a competitive and uncoordinated fashion, proposing rival plans and initiatives to different ministeries. What the Convention does is bring these lessons of experience together in a coherent form, giving clear guidance based on more promising approaches to dryland management.  

<H4>3. What time frame are we working within ?</H4>

The Convention to Combat Desertification was agreed in June 1994, and more than one hundred governments have now signed it.  Almost all African governments are amongst the signatories and 13 of the 15 member states of the EU, in addition to the European Commission itself.  It is not expected to come into force until 1997, because of the time needed for at least 50 governments to ratify the Convention through their own parliaments.  But  following the agreement of the Resolution on Urgent Action for Africa, pilot activities are already under way, with Mali as the first case in Africa.

<H4>4. How can a Convention make a difference to dryland farmers and herders?</H4>

It will only make a difference if the governments concerned decide to take it seriously.  Formally, an international convention is legally binding on those governments which sign it.  In practice, the adherence of signatory governments to any convention may be less closely observed.  Being realistic, the Convention will not change overnight the situation faced by many millions of land users throughout dry Africa.  
<p>
However, there are a sufficient number of affected countries and donor governments who have expressed strong support for the Convention, so we have a good base to start from.  It lays out firm commitments which could bring substantial benefits to ordinary land users throughout the continent.

<H4>5. Why should anyone abide by the Convention, especially since there are no enforceable targets, and no extra funds?</H4>

It is true that there are no extra funds promised by the Convention, unlike the Climate Change Convention or that on Biological Diversity, where funding is provided through the Global Environment Facility.  However, desertification is a rather different sort of problem. Indeed, many observers thought that negotiating a convention was the wrong way to approach this kind of issue.  What we have in this new convention is essentially a ‘code of good conduct’ for recipient governments and donors.  The text expresses the desire of signatories to follow certain guidelines regarding the right policy framework for encouraging more sustainable dryland management, and for how aid is delivered.  
<p>
A code of conduct may have few teeth.  It depends rather on people having an interest in doing better and being seen by others to do better.  The desire to set a good example to others can be a powerful incentive to develop new strategies and methods of work.  Also, signatory governments of affected countries which fail to follow the guidelines laid down by the convention may find it increasingly difficult to persuade OECD donors to give aid funds.  In every developed country, aid money is getting tighter.  Priority is likely to be given to recipients who can demonstrate a willingness to act upon the commitments which they have signed up to.

<H4>6. What have African governments promised to do?</H4>

Various things, including a review of policy in fields such as land tenure,and administration, with a view to transferring power to control land from government hands to local communities and their institutions.  They have pledged to pursue a far more participatory style of decision making and planning of activities. These and other activities are to be incorporated into a national action programme to combat desertification.  

<H4>7. What is the purpose of another environmental action programme ?</H4>

During the 1980s, many developing countries drew up tropical forest action plans, national environmental action plans and national conservation strategies. There are concerns that the CCD could add to this planning overload. However, these national action programmes are not meant to replace existing strategies but, rather to ensure, where necessary, a particular focus on questions of dryland management.  They are not meant to be a formal document listing all of the projects which the government wants to see funded.  Instead, the national action programme needs to direct attention to a series of policy changes, institutional reforms, and broader programmes which need to be under taken to ensure that land users have a greater incentive to invest in their land.

<H4>8. What commitments are donors to fulfil?</H4>

It is clearly recognised that the primary responsibility for improving dryland resource management lies with the affected country.  Donors need to provide support to their efforts by making longer term funds available for national action programmes, and ensuring that such funding is provided in a more flexible fashion.  Donors have also agreed that they will endeavour to coordinate their activities more effectively, to avoid contradictions between their approaches.

<H4>9. How can the commitment to greater participation and decentralisation in project development be accommodated within donor programming ?</H4>

This is one of the most pressing issues for donors such as the EU to resolve. In the short-term, donors need to identify the options for increasing flexibility and participation within existing procedures. Many of these already exist.  The challenge for donors is to share successful country level experience.

<H4>10. What are the national policy preconditions for successful implementation ?</H4>

National governments need to provide a secure environment within which farmers and herders have a firm interest in improving their land. The main actors must be local farmers and herders. Governments and donors must not think it is their job to interfere in telling people what they should be doing.  
<p>
Rights to manage resources must be clearly defined, so that herders have an interest in managing grazing for the longer term  Its no good their establishing systems for setting aside reserve pasture areas, if others can come in from outside and make use of these resources.  In the same way, villagers need to feel secure that their rights to manage woodland and grazing will be respected if people from elsewhere try to come and make charcoal, or settle and start clearing land without the agreement of local people.

<H4>11. What can be done at the local level?</H4>

There are various possibilities.  One is to review land tenure codes to ensure that the allocation of responsibility for land management to the local level is matched by equivalent rights, which ensure that people can control who has access to resources, and on what terms.  A second, and important innovation which is developing in certain Sahelian countries is the drawing up of ‘local conventions’ by a grouping of 5 to 10 villages which share common resources.  These conventions specify the terms on which villagers can cut wood, clear land, and have access to pasture within the overall area.  At the same time, these local conventions lay out the fees which must be paid by outsiders wanting to come and cut wood or pasture their animals within the overall territory of this grouping of villages.  What is very important is that the local administration is now willing to recognise these conventions as constituting a legal basis for supporting villagers’ rights.

<H4>12. What does people’s participation mean in practice?</H4>

Several things. First, a commitment to work more slowly and involve local people and their organisations in discussion from the earliest stage in whatever activity is planned, listening to their views, and building on their knowledge and skills.  Second, investment of resources and time in training - training of local people, project, government, and donor staff in participatory methods for community level planning.  There are a number of participatory techniques available and an increasing body of trainers with experience in this field.  Third, a commitment to invest in building the capacity of local people and organisations to take charge of decisions which affect them through the development of literacy and numeracy skills, access to credit, transfer of powers to control land, and so on.


<H3>Learning from Soil and Water Conservation</H3>

Based on the lessons learned from the past, the Convention offers a promising way forward for all people concerned with poorer parts of the world, and a way of ensuring more effective aid delivery.  It focuses on community-based initiatives and provides practical guidance for planning and project design.  
<p>
While the drylands of the world face certain particular problems, they also have considerable potential, if managed correctly.  We can show plenty of examples of success stories where things have gone right with soil and water conservation.  The Convention provides basic ground rules for ensuring that we have a greater chance of success, and have an aid programme to be proud of.
<p>
In the past, many soil and water conservation (SWC) projects failed because they introduced techniques which were not acceptable to the land users, were technically inappropriate and often required too much maintenance.  During the colonial era people were forced to construct conservation works and after independence they were bribed into it through the systematic use of “food-for-work”.   Where projects systematically used heavy machinery to construct conservation works, the “beneficiaries” tended to assume that as these works were constructed by government, it was also up to the government to maintain them.  Land users were always instructed, but never consulted about what could be done to reverse land degradation.  Where they had devised themselves a range of techniques, these were usually completely overlooked or just ignored.
<p>
When conservation works (terraces, bunds, check dams, cut off drains, etc.) are not well designed or maintained, they fall apart within a few years and they then accelerate erosion rather than reducing it.  Lack of adequate upkeep has been the rule and not the exception.    
<p>
Donor agencies continued to fund poorly performing SWC projects partly because projects were never adequately monitored.  Costs were not matched against real benefits. Whereas most SWC projects assessed the costs of the technical package they promoted, they often only had a vague idea about the benefits that would be generated.  It was not uncommon that projects were believed to be successful, because one simply added each year the number of hectares treated.  In this way impressive figures could be shown.  However, one never deducted the number of hectares treated, but not exploited by the “beneficiaries” or for the number of hectares where conservation works became non-operational after 3 or 4 years.  Finally, experience has also shown that in virtually all cases SWC activities stop as soon as donor funding is withdrawn.
<p>
Since the middle of the 1980s, there has been a shift in thinking about how SWC should be done,  influenced by developments in countries like Burkina Faso.   For more than a decade earth bunds had been constructed on the Central Plateau of Burkina, but these were neither maintained nor expanded.  An OXFAM-funded Agroforestry Project in Yatenga had started to test contour stone bunds in 1979, essentially an improved traditional technique.  Farmers reacted enthusiastically to this and a training programme was initiated at village level to train farmers in the principles of stone bund construction.  Many farmers constructed stone bunds spontaneously on their own fields.  

<H3>Simple and efficient techniques</H3>

The lessons drawn from this experience were that conservation techniques have to be simple, low-cost, efficient and require minimum maintenance in order to be acceptable to land users.  For the first time the ability to replicate was identified as an important design criterion for SWC projects.  Unless the majority of land users undertake SWC on their own fields, the battle against land degradation cannot be won.  In the West African Sahel, a small range of natural resource management techniques can be found which are adopted spontaneously by land users.  They include:
<ul>
<li>contour stone bunds
<li>improved planting pits (zay or tassa)
<li>half moons (demi-lunes)
<li>mulching
<li>compost pits
<li>natural regeneration
</ul><p>
Since the early 1980s, there have been great technical breakthroughs in the Sahel.  In Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali, thousands of hectares of degraded land are now rehabilitated each year, as a result of field experiments by project staff and farmers (see box).
<p>
<center>
<table border=1 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><center><h4>Case Study: Improved planting pits in Niger</h4></center>
Since 1988, IFAD has been funding a SWC project in Niger’s Illéla district to promote simple, low-cost SWC techniques, which can easily be mastered by land users.  In 1989 the project organised a visit by 10 of its farmers (including three women) to the Yatenga region in Burkina Faso.   There they were impressed by the use of improved planting pits to rehabilitate degraded land.  These techniques resembled those they knew traditionally, but which were unimproved and only applied at a small scale.  <p>
Upon return, they treated four hectares of degraded, barren and badly encrusted land 
with astonishing results.  In 1990, a drought year,  farmers treated 70 hectares.  On the fields treated with improved planting pits (tassa) yields were in the order of 300 - 400 kg. of millet and sorghum/ha.  Elsewhere, yields were far lower.  As a result, the number of hectares treated in 1991 increased strongly (between 400 and 500 ha).  Since 1990, about 8000 hectares of degraded land have been rehabilitated in the Illéla district alone by farmers without any external support.  The IFAD-project provides training and a minimum of material support, but its extension agents are completely overtaken by the enthusiasm of farmers.<p>Farmers in neighbouring districts (Tahoua, Konni, Madoua) are now adopting tassa.  Projects in other parts of Niger have begun organising field visits for their farmers to Illéla district.  As a result farmers in the region of Ouallam (North of Niamey) have recently adopted this technique.<p>The IFAD SWC project in Illéla district is unique also in the sense that it has systematically collected yield data for the various techniques it promotes and data are now available for a period of four years, including a drought year (1992) and a wet year (1994).<p> In 1994, the average yield of millet on fields treated with tassa and manure was 969 kg/ha and on fields with tassa and manure plus fertilizers 1486 kg/ha.  A farmer who owns a piece of degraded land spends 40 - 60 days digging improved planting pits on 1 ha.  If he hires labour it will cost him 30.000 CFA/ha.  Assuming a yield of 700 kg of millet/ha at a value of 80 CFA/k, his gross benefit will be 26.000 CFA in year 1.  It will be substantially higher in the following years when he will only have to slightly excavate the pits.  These rehabilitated fields add substantially to food security at household level.<p>In districts adjacent to Illéla, other SWC projects have introduced much higher cost packages ($400 per hectare and more), which produce yields on average lower than those obtained in the improved traditional planting pits. The yields are lower because there is an imbalance between the size of the area rehabilitated with heavy machinery and the capacity of the farmers to manager adequately and exploit this land.  They simply do not have sufficient manure to fertilize these fields or labour to weed the crop.  Simple techniques which build on local practice offer a cost effective way for rehabilitating land.  Donors should examine how to support this process of adoption.

<p>
The systematic use of simple SWC techniques by farmers on their own fields is an indispensable first step in the battle against land degradation.  It leads to an intensification of land use and it improves household food security.  However, it is not sufficient as  it does not address the degradation on non-cultivated village lands, which is exactly where “village land use management projects (gestion de terroirs)” try to innovate.
<p>
Donor agencies can facilitate and accelerate the adoption of these simple and effective SWC techniques through the funding of farmer-to-farmer exchange visits, farmer training (men and women) and well targeted material support. A high priority is the introduction of local means of transport, like donkey carts, which are manufactured in the region, thereby strengthening non-farm employment.     
<p>
Much has been achieved in the last 10 years in the Sahel in the field of SWC.  The challenge is still considerable, but at least we know better than in the past what to do and how to do it.

<CENTER><H3><IMG SRC  = "../images/ie.jpg"><p>IRISH AID : 20 QUESTIONS</h3>
Vist the Main Irish Aid Web Site: <A HREF="http://www.irlgov.ie/iveagh/foreignaffairs/default.htm#c"  target="_top">http://www.irlgov.ie/iveagh/foreignaffairs/default.htm#c</a></CENTER>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT>
<BR>
<B>1.	WHAT IS IRISH AID?</B><BR>
<BR>
Irish Aid is the Irish Government's Official Development Assistance (ODA) Programme. It provides long-term support and emergency relief to developing countries, particularly in the Sub-Saharan region of Africa.<B> </B>It is administered according to principles laid down in &quot;<A HREF="http://www.irlgov.ie/iveagh/foreignaffairs/irishaid/strategy/index.html"  target="_top">Irish Aid: Consolidation and Growth: A Strategy Plan</A>&quot;, published by the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1993.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2.	WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF IRISH AID?</B><BR>
<BR>
Irish Aid is designed to alleviate poverty and meet the basic needs of people in some of the world's poorest countries. It works in partnership with the people and governments of these countries to help them to control their own economic and social development. <BR>
<BR>
<B>3.	WHAT TYPE OF PROJECTS ARE UNDERTAKEN?</B><BR>
<BR>
Projects are undertaken in such areas as primary health care, education, sanitation, rural development and capacity building (the establishment of government structures which can carry on the work). There is a strong emphasis on training local people who can then continue with the projects after Irish Aid assistance has been phased out.<BR>
<BR>
<B>4.	WHO IS IN CHARGE OF IRISH AID?</B><BR>
<BR>
Ms Joan Burton, T.D., Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, has special responsibility for Irish Aid.<BR>
<BR>
<B>5.	HOW LARGE IS THE IRISH AID BUDGET?</B><BR>
<BR>
The budget for 1996 is a record £106 million. The figures for 1993, 1994 and 1995 were £55 million, £70 million and £89 million, respectively. All funding is given in the form of grants. As no loans are given, no debt is created.At a time when many other countries are cutting their overseas aid budgets, the Irish Government is committed to increasing the Irish Aid budget towards a UN-recommended level of 0.7% GNP. <BR>
<BR>
<B>6.	HOW IS IRISH AID ADMINISTERED?</B><BR>
<BR>
Irish Aid is administered through the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin, which maintains diplomatic missions in five of the most important recipient countries of Irish Aid. Funds are distributed in the forms of bilateral and multilateral aid.<BR>
<BR>
<B>7.	WHAT IS BILATERAL AID?</B><BR>
<BR>
Bilateral aid is given directly by the Irish Government - or is sometimes given through Non- Governmental Organisations (NGOs) - to projects in developing countries. These projects have been carefully assessed and are being thoroughly monitored. Most are in priority countries.<BR>
<BR>
<B>8.	WHAT ARE PRIORITY COUNTRIES?</B><BR>
<BR>
Because there are so many parts of the world in need of assistance, each donor country selects particular priority countries to receive the bulk of its aid. Ireland's priority countries, for which one of the main selection criteria is low GNP, are: Ethiopia, Lesotho, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.<BR>
<BR>
<B>9.	WHAT IS MULTILATERAL AID?</B><BR>
<BR>
Multilateral aid is channelled through international organisations, such as the United Nations.<BR>
<BR>
<B>10.	WHAT ROLE DOES IRISH AID PLAY IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY?</B><BR>
<BR>
Ireland is involved in the decision-making processes of the European Union (EU) and of the United Nations (UN), in relation to overseas development. Some 38% of the 1995 Irish Aid budget is being invested in large-scale, multilateral aid projects financed by the EU and various UN organisations.<BR>
										<BR>
<B>11.	WHAT IS IRISH AID'S ROLE IN RELATION TO REFUGEES?</B><BR>
<BR>
There are about 1000 refugees in Ireland, most of whom are from Vietnam or Bosnia. An additional 250 Bosnian refugees, together with family members, are due to arrive before mid- 1996. Irish Aid is responsible for the travel arrangements of refugees and works in close cooperation with the Refugee Agency, a body established by the Government in 1991, under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs.<BR>
<BR>
A new Refugee Bill has been introduced (6 October 1995) which aims to place Ireland at the forefront of progressive international law and practice in relation to asylum seekers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>12.	WHAT IS EMERGENCY HUMANITARIAN RELIEF?</B><BR>
<BR>
Irish Aid allocates a certain percentage of its budget to emergency humanitarian assistance, to help countries that are experiencing catastrophes in the form of natural disasters, famine, war or civil strife (eg, Rwanda, Somalia and former Yugoslavia). <BR>
<BR>
Emergency aid is channelled through NGOs such as Concern, Tr&oacute;caire, Goal, Christian Aid, Gorta, Irish Red Cross and through various international agencies such as UNICEF and UNHCR.<BR>
<BR>
<B>13.	WHAT TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP EXISTS BETWEEN IRISH AID AND NGOs?</B><BR>
<BR>
Irish Aid works in close cooperation with NGOs for both bilateral and multilateral aid programmes. One special feature is the NGO Co-Financing Scheme, whereby Irish Aid pays up to 75% of the cost of particular NGO projects. This scheme is not restricted to large NGOs and small missionary orders and other organisations may also apply.<BR>
<BR>
<B>14.	WHAT IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN IRISH AID AND APSO?</B><BR>
<BR>
APSO (Agency for Personal Services Overseas) is a state sponsored body, set up in 1974. It enables Irish people to share their skills and knowledge with people in the developing world. APSO receives a grant-in-aid from the Department of Foreign Affairs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>15.	WHAT STANCE DOES IRISH AID TAKE ON HUMAN RIGHTS?</B><BR>
<BR>
Irish Aid supports human rights and democratisation. It encourages the development of institutions and mechanisms that empower people, especially the poor or those who are victims of discrimination.<BR>
<BR>
<B>16.	WHAT STANCE DOES IRISH AID TAKE ON GENDER ISSUES?</B><BR>
<BR>
Irish Aid is committed to gender equality in all areas of development. It particularly encourages projects that offer education and training for women which will allow them to participate fully in all aspects of decision-making.<BR>
<BR>
<B>17.	HOW ARE IRISH AID PROJECTS ASSESSED?</B><BR>
<BR>
All projects submitted to Irish Aid are assessed at local level, at Departmental level and by the Audit and Evaluation Unit. This body comprises a panel of experts from a number of areas (including auditing, health, education and rural development), each of whom has experience of working in overseas development.<BR>
<BR>
<B>18.	WHY HAS IRISH AID INTRODUCED A NEW AWARENESS PROGRAMME?</B><BR>
<BR>
Irish Aid has recently appointed an Information Officer to publicise its activities. As the aid programme expands, it is important to keep the public informed of the aims, objectives and activities of Irish Aid. Part of the Information Officer's brief is to give the public a sense of ownership of the Programme.<BR>
<BR>
A brochure about Irish Aid has recently been published and a series of fact-sheets is being prepared. Each fact-sheet will describe a different aspect of Irish Aid's activities. The first of these fact-sheets will be available in the spring of 1996. <BR>
<BR>
<B>19.	WHAT IS THE <A HREF="../iaac/iaac.htm">IRISH AID ADVISORY COMMITTEE</a>?</B><BR>
<BR>
The Irish Aid Advisory Committee (IAAC) was set up in November 1993, as part of the Government's Strategy Plan for Irish Aid. The functions of the 14-member Committee are to advise the Minister for Foreign Affairs on matters relating to: development cooperation; policy aspects of Ireland's aid programme; and the operation, consolidation and expansion of the Irish Aid programme.<BR>

<p>
Post-independence strategies gave the state a lead role in managing development, often excluding other
actors. During the 1980s, this centralist, top-down approach was challenged. Structural adjustment
and democratisation processes created space for direct involvement of civil society actors. Institutional
pluralism, participatory development and decentralisation became the new buzzwords. Against this
background, the European Union (EU) introduced the concept of "decentralised cooperation" into the
Lom&#233; IV Convention. It allows a wide variety of partners outside central government to use
Lom&#233; resources, which in the past were the monopoly of central government agencies. NGO's
in particular, moved to the forefront as the 'third institutional sector' along with the state and business.
<p>
This new approach to aid delivery has great potential. Direct support to civil society actors may bring
development closer to the people, enhance local ownership and accountability. Actively involving local
actors is often seen to be the best investment in "capacity development."
<p>
Progress in implementation, however, has been limited. There are strong political, bureaucratic and
cultural resistances to decentralised cooperation. Neither central government, nor donors have much
experience in working with civil society actors as equal partners  -- rather than simply as beneficiaries
or executing agencies. It is not clear what decentralised cooperation actually means and what makes
it so different from traditional approaches. Implementation is hampered by a lack of appropriate
dialogue structures (interfaces) and flexible procedures. The different actors involved still need to
clarify their new roles in decentralised cooperation and to adapt their capacities accordingly.
<p>
Using the experience of the EU under the Lom&#233; Convention, this paper introduces the concept
of decentralised cooperation, its origin and constituent elements; it identifies some of the key factors
that have hampered effective implementation; it summarises the main changes emerging from the
recent mid-term review of the Lom&#233; Convention. The final chapter draws some broader
conclusions on how to improve the implementation of decentralised cooperation.
<p>

<a name="con"><h3>THE CONCEPT OF DECENTRALISED COOPERATION</h3></a>
<p>
Decentralised cooperation was one of the innovations of the fourth Lom&#233; Convention signed in
1989 between the European Union (EU) and the ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) countries. It
paved the way for economic, social and cultural organizations (other than central bureaucracies) to
submit development projects and to obtain Lom&#233; funding. 
<p>
This innovation reflected the worldwide thrust towards political liberalisation, changing perceptions
on the role of the state in development and a search for alternative channels of aid delivery. It was
seen as a step towards greater involvement of the people directly concerned by development
programmes and a tool for the creation of a democratic fabric. It also sought to promote the active
involvement of the European civil society in development (i.e. North South partnerships between local
authorities, private sector associations, trade unions, etc.).
<p>
Several factors led to the adoption of decentralised cooperation in Lom&#233; IV:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Political changes.  The worldwide thrust towards political liberalisation of the 1980s challenged
      the state's monopoly on power and gave a boost to civil society. New conditionalities have
      emerged that link aid provision to the type and quality of government [Moore, 1993]. This,
      in turn, led to a renewed interest for decentralisation as a possible response to the financial
      crisis and lack of efficiency of the state apparatus [M'Bassi, 1995, Manor, 1995].
<p>
<li>Shifting views on the role of the state  Chambers [1993] distinguishes three clusters of views.
      The neo-Fabian ideology of the 1970s gave the state a major direct role in development. The
      neo-liberal model was a creature of the 1980s. In recent years, a new paradigm has evolved,
      based on "putting people before things, and poor people first; development through a learning
      process rather than by blueprint; decentralisation, democracy and diversity to value local
      knowledge; participation and small group and community action; and open and effective
      communication and access." Decentralised cooperation proposes a practical application of this
      paradigm. In this new approach, the role of central government is no longer to dominate the
      development policy process, but to provide an enabling environment for a variety of relatively
      autonomous institutional actors" [Oluwu, 1992].
      
<li>Concern to get value for money.  The need to enhance aid effectiveness led donor agencies to
      move away from exclusive partnerships with African bureaucracies, generally perceived to
      be "overdeveloped and unaccountable" [Fowler, 1991; see also Dia, 1993] and to embrace
      non-state actors as alternative channels of aid delivery. Decentralised cooperation was seen
      to offer major benefits. It would make it possible to reach out directly to the "primary actors"
      of development; to prevent a monopolistic and non-transparent use of resources and to build
      local capacity. 
</ul>
<p>

<a name="old"><h3>OLD WINE IN NEW BOTTLES?</h3></a>
<p>
To what extent is decentralisation cooperation really a "new" approach, and how different is it from
traditional modes of operation?
<p>
There are no easy answers to this question. Participation and decentralisation have been on the
development agenda for quite some time. There is a long-standing tradition of cooperation with local
NGO's and to a lesser extent, with local authorities. Furthermore, decentralised cooperation means
different things to different people. Some see it as a merely another financing line for NGO's. Others
argue that decentralised cooperation is about twinning or partnerships between decentralised public
authorities (as in the French system). Others, including Commission officials, claim that the purpose
of decentralised cooperation is not to finance a multitude of isolated projects, but to promote
cooperation between different actors at local level. Field managers find it difficult to see the difference
with the micro-projects scheme, introduced under Lom&#233; I (1975-1980).
<p>
The problem is compounded by the very open-ended nature of decentralised cooperation, as promoted
under the Convention. The Commission has always been reluctant to come up with clear principles,
eligibility criteria and procedures, for decentralised cooperation. This was done partly to avoid conflict
with the ACP states, partly to prevent rigidity in management. It was felt that new rules and
regulations would reduce the scope for innovation, flexibility and country specific approaches.
<p>
Yet careful reading of official reports and statements, makes it possible to identify some distinctive
basic features of decentralised cooperation programmes:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Political agenda. Decentralised cooperation is not so much a new instrument as a different
      political approach to development cooperation. There are clear linkages with the idea of
      "participatory development" and the promotion of democracy and human rights;  strengthening
      the organs of civil society is expected to gradually broaden participation of non-state actors
      in policy-making, both at local and national levels; and direct funding to a wide variety of 
      associations may help to promote the formation of interest groups which can challenge
      monopolistic tendencies and poor state performance. 
<p>
<li>Transfer of decision-making and management responsibilities. The bottom-line of decentralised
      cooperation is to support initiatives that originate directly from the local communities and 
      associations. There is no longer room for top-down forms of participation, where
      "beneficiaries" or "target groups" are invited to implement development projects designed 
      elsewhere. Decentralised cooperation aims at reducing the number of "intermediaries" in 
      managing aid and to put an end to "la logique du d&#233;veloppeur". Responsibility for
      programme identification and implementation is delegated to the lowest possible level (the 
      principle of subsidiarity). The transfer of financial responsibilities to the local actors is seen
      as the cornerstone of decentralised cooperation. This is a major innovation within the
      Lom&#233; framework. Central government agencies will no longer be able to interfere in
      the day-to-day management of decentralised operations (including sensitive issues such as
      tenders). This has led some cynics to argue that decentralised cooperation is an elegant way
      to devolve or spread corruption more evenly.
<p>
<li>Capacity Development. In decentralised cooperation, this is seen as both a means and an end.
      It make little sense to transfer management responsibilities in the absence of targeted capacity
      development programmes that enable local actors to assume their new roles. On the other
      hand, involving local actors through a process of "learning by doing" is often the best
      investment in capacity development; it helps to strengthen the capacity of civil society to
      formulate their own development priorities; and it may contribute to building strong
      intermediate organisations that can "voice" the needs of the poor. 
<p>
<li>Linkage with national development policies. Decentralised cooperation does not mean opposition
      to government, but a search for complementarities. The purpose is not to shift support away
      from government to a myriad of local NGO's. The limits of the "go it alone" approach have
      been clearly evidenced in Mozambique where, in 1990, no less than 170 foreign NGO's were
      running programmes in complete isolation from the State -- in many cases, these "new
      missionaries" had divided the country into "mini-kingdoms" [Hanlon, 1991]. Decentralised
      cooperation under Lom&#233; attempts to avoid these pitfalls. It emphasises cooperation
      rather than antagonism between central government and local actors. It wants to give a
      prominent role to local governments as a nexus between the central agencies, the donor
      community and the local actors (NGO's included).
<p>
<li>Different roles for northern partners. Decentralised cooperation is not another financing line for
      cooperation between northern associations (e.g. NGO's) and their southern counterparts. In
      contrast with the traditional NGO co-financing modalities, decentralised cooperation aims to
      directly fund a variety of local organisations. Alliance with a northern partner is still possible,
      but no longer a prerequisite to access funds. It is hoped that this will induce northern NGO's
      to reduce their heavy involvement in project execution and to take up other roles (e.g.
      capacity development of local partners, assistance in managing direct funding, lobbying and
      advocacy).
</ul>
<p>

<h3><a name="#dec">DECENTRALISED COOPERATION IN PRACTICE</h3></a>
<p>
A recent survey by the Commission, based on questionnaires completed by the Delegations, indicates
that most decentralised cooperation programmes are still experimental in nature. In several ACP
countries, political conditions are increasingly favourable to decentralised cooperation. This is
particularly the case for countries involved in decentralisation processes. Promising efforts are made
to disseminate information, to start a dialogue between state and civil society (e.g. Zimbabwe,
Senegal) and to set up decentralised aid programmes (in some cases in close collaboration with local
authorities).
<p>
On the whole, however, traditional approaches are still dominant. From the survey, it clearly appears
that most decentralised cooperation programmes are not so different from classical micro-projects. 
Local actors are seldom involved in project identification, appraisal and selection. Programme
management remains highly centralised. There is only limited delegation of financial authority. The
mobilisation of EU decentralised partners has not really materialised.
<p>
This slow pace of implementation ought not be surprising. Time is needed to change top-down
attitudes [Mukandala, 1992], to reduce levels of mutual mistrust and to agree upon new roles,
management approaches and procedures.  The main bottlenecks to effective implementation include: 
<p>

<i>Political, bureaucratic and cultural resistances in ACP states</i>
<p>
Decentralised cooperation runs contrary to the centralist state view of cooperation, which characterised
all previous Conventions. Old attitudes die hard. ACP State see little incentives to change this and to
make provision in their indicative programmes for decentralised cooperation. Many governments are
afraid to devolve responsibilities and thus to lose control over aid resources and related benefits. The
hostility towards decentralising part of the aid budgets mirrors resistance to any form of political
decentralisation. Research on the relation between African government and NGO's confirms this view:
"the amount of space allowed to NGO's in any given country is determined first and foremost by
political considerations, rather than by any calculation of the contribution of NGO's to social and
economic development" [Bratton, 1989]. The lack of clear operational guidance does not offer an
incentive for field managers to venture into decentralised cooperation. Furthermore, little progress will
be achieved if civil society actors continue to see the state as the "enemy" or to compete with each
other for donor funds and local popularity.  
<p>

<i>Conflicting views on the purpose of decentralised cooperation</i>
<p>
Decentralised cooperation meant different things to different people. ACP governments in favour of
the scheme tend to see it as a way to involve NGO's and other decentralised actors in the
implementation of Lom&#233; programmes. This reflects the fairly limited view that ACP states tend
to have on the role of decentralised actors. Local NGO's, for instance, are invited to participate in
the execution of poverty alleviation projects, aiming at mitigating the social cost of adjustment, not
to discuss the adjustment programmes themselves. This approach is consistent with the wider
decentralisation policies of most African states. The tendency for central governments has been to 
devolve its functions to the local level in order to improve implementation of projects -- to bring top-
down development closer to the people [Mutahaba, 1989]. Not surprisingly, this narrow interpretation
is questioned by decentralised actors. NGO's, for instance, increasingly want to be involved at the 
planning stage, when the country is setting its priorities. They reject the role of mere "subcontracting
agencies", i.e. cheap delivery systems for the implementation of development programmes decided
elsewhere. They argue that decentralised cooperation is not about funding, but access to joint decision-
making.
<p>

<i>Lack of adequate procedures</i>
<p>
The nature of the Lom&#233; Convention (a legal partnership agreement between the EU and ACP
governments) offers little scope for a truly decentralised approach. Lom&#233; IV procedures, for
instance, reserve a key role at each stage of the project cycle for the National Authorising Officer 
(NAO), the official ACP representative in charge of EU aid. This cumbersome decision-making and
management system is hard to reconcile with the autonomy of decentralised actors and bottom-up
participatory activities.  In addition to this, the new scheme was introduced without serious
consideration of its institutional and managerial implications. People in the field were left with no 
clear indications on how to set up and to operate decentralised cooperation programmes. Many critical
questions remain unanswered. What are the eligibility criteria and priority areas of intervention? How
are appropriate partners identified and selected? How to set up a dialogue with decentralised actors?
How is decentralised cooperation with prevailing EDF procedures? How to monitor this type of
programme? How to involve central government in decentralised cooperation and what new capacities
need to be developed, both in recipient countries and donor agencies to operate the new scheme? 
<p>

<i>Capacity problems</i>
<p>
The different actors involved are poorly equipped to use this chapter of the Convention. This certainly
holds true for civil society. Knowledge of the modalities of decentralised cooperation is extremely
low. In January 1994, the Liaison Committee of Development NGO's to the EU and MWENGO (a
Zimbabwe based NGO) organised a workshop on decentralised cooperation. Few of the African
NGO's attending the meeting had any knowledge of the Lom&#233; Convention. They find it difficult
to find their way to the Delegation and to comply with EDF procedures. In some countries,
governments and donor agencies are willing to decentralise, but they do not find a well structured and
representative civil society that has the capacity to enter into new partnerships. Lack of information
also prevents European decentralised actors from participating in the scheme. Central government
agencies, from their side, have little experience and capacity for dealing with a variety of autonomous
civil society actors. There are also capacity problems at the Commission side, particularly in the
country Delegations. Managing decentralised cooperation is a time-consuming task. It requires
specialist knowledge and skills, including with regard to participatory techniques, decentralised
management and monitoring systems. All of this is not readily available in the understaffed
Delegations. 
<p>

<h3><a name="#cha">CHANGES SINCE THE MID-TERM REVIEW</h3></a>
<p>
The mid-term review of Lom&#233; IV has recently been concluded and a new financial protocol 
agreed upon. The future Convention will have a new section on decentralised cooperation,
incorporating the main changes of the mid-term review of Lom&#233; (see new text in annex).
<p>
From the outset of the negotiations, the EU expressed a keen interest to expand the opportunities and
level of resources for this type of aid delivery. It was claimed that decentralised cooperation reflects
the primary objectives of EU development cooperation (i.e. the promotion of democracy, participatory
development and poverty alleviation).
<p>
The mandate of the EU seemed to concentrate on (i) creating space for upstream participation of
decentralised actors in defining the next National Indicative Programme (NIP); (ii) to expand the
funding opportunities for decentralised cooperation programmes in the NIP's, and (iii) to change the
rules for decision-making and management (i.e. to review the role of the NAO in allocating
Lom&#233; resources). 
<p>
This mandate has not fully materialised, partly as result of fierce opposition from ACP states against
the idea of direct funding. This led to the following compromise:
<p>
<ul>
<li>With a view of broadening participation in formulating future indicative programmes, a "Joint
      Declaration on the Consultation and Information of Agents of Development" was agreed upon.
      According to this Declaration, ACP States will endeavour to organize "exchanges of views"
      with decentralised actors and to provide "relevant information necessary for their participation
      in the implementation of the programmes." If needed, and resources are available, the
      Commission can provide financial support for this type of consultation and information
      exchange. Most decentralised actors, including the private sector, are likely to be dissatisfied
      with this timid attempt to democratize the policy dialogue on Lom&#233; programming.  
<p>
<li>Three funding modalities will be available in the new Convention. First, ACP states themselves
      can incorporate specific decentralised cooperation programmes in the NIP's. Second,
      decentralised actors can participate in the execution of government programmes included in
      the NIP. Third, and this is really new, ACP states can reserve a certain percentage of their
      NIP to finance a wide variety of decentralised activities, to be determined at a latter stage.
      The open-ended nature of this window may help to provide direct and flexible support to
      genuine local initiatives. The existence of such a specific "guichet" depends entirely on the
      goodwill of the ACP state involved. Here again, fierce defenders of decentralised cooperation
      might feel disappointed. They might have expected a stronger EU stance on this critical point,
      including the option of reducing the allocation of Lom&#233; resources to those countries
      failing to put aside money for decentralised cooperation. 
<p>
<li>The principles with regard to the role of national authorities have not been modified. ACP-EU
      cooperation support decentralised cooperation "within limits laid down by the ACP states
      concerned". This provision ought not be a problem in countries which are supportive of
      participation and decentralisation. It may help to ensure the necessary coherence between
      national development plans and local initiatives. But in countries facing poor governance
      conditions, it is a recipe for failure. It will make it very difficult to reach out to local
      populations and organisations. 
</ul>
<p>
<a name="#pra"><hr><h3>DECENTRALISED COOPERATION IN PRACTICE</h3></a>

and level of resources for this type of aid delivery. It was claimed that decentralised cooperation
reflects the primary objectives of EU development cooperation (i.e. the promotion of democracy,
participatory development and poverty alleviation).
<p>
The mandate of the EU seemed to concentrate on (i) creating space for upstream participation of
decentralised actors in defining the next National Indicative Programme (NIP); (ii) to expand the
funding opportunities for decentralised cooperation programmes in the NIP's, and (iii) to change
the rules for decision-making and management (i.e. to review the role of the NAO in allocating
Lom&#233; resources). 
<p>
This mandate has not fully materialised, partly as result of fierce opposition from ACP states
against the idea of direct funding. This led to the following compromise:
<p>
<ul>
<li>With a view of broadening participation in formulating future indicative programmes, a
      "Joint Declaration on the Consultation and Information of Agents of Development" was
      agreed upon. According to this Declaration, ACP States will endeavour to organize
      "exchanges of views" with decentralised actors and to provide "relevant information
      necessary for their participation in the implementation of the programmes." If needed, and
      resources are available, the Commission can provide financial support for this type of
      consultation and information exchange. Most decentralised actors, including the private
      sector, are likely to be dissatisfied with this timid attempt to democratize the policy
      dialogue on Lom&#233; programming.  
<p>
<li>Three funding modalities will be available in the new Convention. First, ACP states
      themselves can incorporate specific decentralised cooperation programmes in the NIP's.
      Second, decentralised actors can participate in the execution of government programmes
      included in the NIP. Third, and this is really new, ACP states can reserve a certain
      percentage of their NIP to finance a wide variety of decentralised activities, to be
      determined at a latter stage. The open-ended nature of this window may help to provide
      direct and flexible support to genuine local initiatives. The existence of such a specific
      "guichet" depends entirely on the goodwill of the ACP state involved. Here again, fierce
      defenders of decentralised cooperation might feel disappointed. They might have expected
      a stronger EU stance on this critical point, including the option of reducing the allocation
      of Lom&#233; resources to those countries failing to put aside money for decentralised
      cooperation. 
<p>
<li>The principles with regard to the role of national authorities have not been modified. ACP-
      EU cooperation support decentralised cooperation "within limits laid down by the ACP
      states concerned". This provision ought not be a problem in countries which are supportive
      of participation and decentralisation. It may help to ensure the necessary coherence
      between national development plans and local initiatives. But in countries facing poor
      governance conditions, it is a recipe for failure. It will make it very difficult to reach out
      to local populations and organisations. 
</ul>
<p>
<a name="#imp"><h3><hr>IMPROVING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DECENTRALISED
COOPERATION</h3></a>
<p>
Overcoming current constraints to effective implementation will, inevitably, be a slow process.
Time is needed to move away from thirty years of centralised development cooperation. The way
forward lies with practice, experimentation, learning by doing, risk-taking and critical feedback.
This, in turn, may help to prevent donor-driven, blueprint approaches to decentralised cooperation.
<p>
In this final section, we draw broader conclusions on how to improve the implementation of
decentralised cooperation -- some of which is equally relevant to bilateral agencies and northern
NGO's.
<p>
<I>1. Adopt country-specific approaches</i>
Decentralised cooperation is not done in a vacuum. Progress is likely to be influenced, to a very
large extent, by the conditions prevailing in recipient countries. Each country will have to find its
own way to implement decentralised cooperation; there is no room for standardized packages.
Decentralised cooperation will be slow to materialise if the political and economic power remains
highly centralised and civil society very fragmented. No amount of donor pressure is likely to
rapidly change this. It is likely to gain momentum in countries that have a strong commitment to
political decentralisation and a booming civil society. In countries carrying out an ambitious
decentralisation policy, donor agencies and foreign NGO's will need to make some clear choices.
What is the most appropriate "entry point" (i.e. partner) for providing support to local initiatives?
How best to use the new opportunities created at district level? How to ensure coherence between
local programmes and government decentralisation programmes?
<p>
Recent research in Uganda, to which the author was associated, indicates that different options are
possible, each presenting strengths and weaknesses. Some donor agencies might prefer to fully
support the political decentralisation process of the Ugandan government. This may lead them to
provide (direct) financial and institutional support to district structures. The advantage of this
approach is that the donor programme works within existing structures. It starts from the premise
that district structures are there to stay (which is not the case with donor agencies and foreign
NGO's). Supporting the emergence of a strong local framework for development planning and
coordination may help to ensure domestic political and administrative accountability. Linking aid
programmes to existing structures provides better chances for sustainability. This option also
carries risks. Donor programmes can be trapped in local politics. The focus on official bodies
(politicians and civil servants) may make it difficult to reach out to the bottom level and to ensure
genuine participation. Other agencies (primarily northern NGO's) might decide to choose local
communities and groups as the main "entry point."  District authorities are not neglected but
perceived in a rather functional way (i.e. as a potential resource to be tapped to ensure project
implementation). This type of decentralised cooperation  may facilitate a truly participatory
approach and capacity-building of decentralised actors. But the problem here will be to 'scale up'
toward the district structures. District authorities (lacking basic facilities, resources and appropriate
salaries) are likely to resent parallel programmes, richly endowed with operational budgets,
vehicles, topping-up salaries. This, in turn, may threaten the sustainability of the programmes.
<p>
These contrasting experiences also point to the need to adopt a comprehensive approach to
supporting decentralisation. 
<p>

<I>2. Promote cooperation rather than competition </i>
Past development practice has been characterised by the paucity of institutional forms used to
achieve development objectives. After a period of almost exclusive cooperation with central
agencies, the danger is now to radically shift donor support to private actors (including NGO's).
<p>
This is not the best path to follow. Either-or approaches have no place in decentralised
cooperation: "Development from below requires development from above, using combinations of
hard and soft political power, tight and loose bureaucratic controls, and forms of centralisation and
decentralisation, Above all, without mutual respect among levels of government, there can be no
community empowerment" (Werlin, 1989]. 
<p>
Simply "rolling back the state" is no panacea. The long-running "state-versus-market" debate has
lost much of its poignancy. Indiscriminate privatization and dismantling of the state is "as much an
error as the earlier whole-cloth commitment to centralist-bureaucratic organization" [Wunsch,
1991; Boye, 1992]. Experience in East Asia highlights the critical role of a strong and efficient
government [Ranis, 1989]. Links between democratisation and development remain haphazard
[Healey, Ketley and Robinson, 1993; Ellis, 1995]. 
<p>
Developing countries that have been successful in pursuing growth and alleviating poverty are
generally those "whose politics have concentrated sufficient power, probity, autonomy and
competence at the centre to shape, pursue and encourage the achievement of explicit and
nationally-determined development objectives" [Leftwich, 1994]. Moreover, the limitations of
"civil society" actors as development agents, working outside national policy frameworks, are
increasingly recognised [Ukpong, 1993]. Often, the division between state and civil society is not
obvious [Mamdani, 1992]. Doubts have been raised as to their capacity to have significant impact
on political reform [Fowler, 1991].
<p>
The message is clear. The polemics of centralised versus decentralised systems ought to be
avoided. Government should not be put in a position that it feels threatened or at the losing end. It
would be unwise for donor agencies simply to circumvent central government and to distribute aid
resources randomly among a wide variety of decentralised actors. Both the relevance and
sustainability of this type of activities may depend, to a large extent, on a supportive role of
governments (e.g. financing of recurrent costs). Civil society institutions can complement the
action of the state, but not replace it:  "NGO's are not the answer when the state is weak [...].
NGO's should in fact strengthen the state by making it accountable to its own people by a process
of strengthening civil society. A strong civil society invariably leads to a strong state and the
opposite is true" [Chitega, 1994]. 
<p>
The challenge is rather to convince government that decentralised cooperation may help it to
achieve the objectives of its structural adjustment programme, to help generate income, provide
employment and offset the social cost of economic and institutional reform programmes [Laidler,
1994]. In a similar vein, it has been argued that "the rise in participation will be less threatening
to the states that are strong and more institutionalized" [Van de Walle, 1994].
<p>
If levels of mutual distrust can be reduced, there is scope to establish new partnership between
governments and decentralised actors [Farrington, 1993]. Donor agencies play a critical role in
promoting this type of complementary linkages by providing adequate financial incentives.
<p>

<I>3. Develop new institutional arrangements and procedures</i>
Decentralised cooperation cannot work in the absence of new institutional arrangements for
dialogue, decision-making and implementation. This will require institutional creativity and
innovation. A first priority is to develop both new "interfaces" (dialogue structures) between
central government and decentralised actors. In several countries, this will have to be done from
scratch. Thirty years of authoritarian rule have created a major gap between state and civil society,
resulting in distrust of officialdom. There is a lack of shared norms and institutions with sufficient
legitimacy so as to ensure adherence of civil society actors. A second priority is to put in place
appropriate decision-making and implementation structures for decentralised operations.
Management authority can, for instance, be delegated to "steering committees" (representing the
different stakeholders, including central governments and donors), independent trust funds or
private agencies. 
<p>
There is equally need for efficient funding procedures, allowing for a quick response to grassroots 
initiatives. Finally, there will be little political and managerial support to transfer responsibilities
(i.e. "to lose control") in the absence of efficient monitoring and evaluation systems. To the extent
possible, these monitoring systems should be locally embedded.
<p>

<I>4. Learn to work with local governments</i>
Empirical research in different regions of the developing world has demonstrated that a nonprofit
sector, funded by external donors, is not a valid alternative to a public sector with domestic
responsibility [Meyer, 1992; Batkin, 1992]. NGO's are not in a position to substitute for central
government provision of basic services, nor is it their role. Local governments, placed in between 
NGO's and the central government, may provide a more appropriate institutional framework.  
<p>
The climate seems ripe for increasing support to local governments. In many African countries,
central government agencies are "opening up", while civil society actors are making efforts to
"scale up".  The local government system may offer a platform for democratic interaction,
participation and the search for new partnerships between different actors. 
<p>
Aid agencies have not been very good in providing support to the emergence of a viable local
governance system. At best, they have provided some financial support, technical assistance and
training to local authorities. At worst, donor agencies have simply ignored their potential role in
development policy management. In recent years, new approaches have been advocated, including 
"short-term external assistance for recurrent financing" [Therkildsen and Semboja, 1992].  
<p>
Northern NGO's will also need to reconsider their policies. For too long a time, they have tended
to by-pass local authorities, and have often weakened the structures by recruiting their staff at
higher salaries. NGO's need to work both on the "demand side" (i.e. helpg communities to be
more productive and to demand better government services) but equally on the "supply side"  --
working with line ministries and other authorities at both the provincial and local level to ensure
that they have qualified manpower, funds and equipment to work effectively. Only in those few
countries facing complete economic and political collapse should NGO's try to take on these
functions themselves [Goyder, 1994].
<p>

<I>5. Decentralising the "mind" of donor agencies</i>
This is relatively easy at the policy level, as decentralisation has become a rallying cry among
donor agencies. Adopting a 'decentralised mind' is far more difficult at the managerial and
institutional level. It implies a profound change in donor attitudes, management, procedures and
organisation -- much alike the change central government agencies have to undergo. It will require
changes in programme design and implementation, technical cooperation policies, division of
responsibilities between field offices and headquarters and accountability systems. It may need a
revision of the current project cycle, to adapt it to the participatory framework of decentralised
cooperation. There is, for instance, no room for an army of external experts, called in to quickly
elaborate a detailed programme document or to play a dominant role in implementation. Another
critical issue is the accountability requirements. Pressures on donor agencies to justify the use of
aid funds may lead them to move accountability "upwards" (i.e. towards their own constituencies)
rather than "downwards" (i.e. towards local beneficiaries). This, in turn, may increase the
administrative burden on local organisations, having to elaborate an endless stream of accounts and
reports. A possible alternative is to make greater use of local accountability systems. Perhaps the
most difficult change will be to adapt the "language" of development cooperation to the real world
and values of decentralised actors. 
<p>

<I>6. Increase knowledge</i>
<ul>
Decentralisation and participation have become new fads among donor agencies. They are
promoted almost as a panacea for improving aid effectiveness. This is a risky approach:
<p>
<li>Both concepts make assumptions about state and civil society which are neither justified nor
      even properly examined [de Kadt, Mars and White, 1992). There is, for instance, no
      guarantee that local policy-making will be more relevant, participatory and development-
      oriented than a centralised approach [Crook, 1991]. The 'politics of the belly' ('la
      politique du ventre') may find a stronger expression at local level. The recent proliferation
      of local NGO's in Africa is a signal. Their levels of legitimacy, capacity and
      accountability are extremely varied.
  
<li>Problems of capacity are likely to be even more pronounced at local level. Donor agencies
      are well-advised not to over-estimate the capacity of civil society actors to quickly assume
      a lead role or to absorb large amounts of money. It will be important to systematically
      adapt financial flows to recipient implementation capacities. Intermediary NGO's can play
      a key role in providing a link between donor agencies and local groups [Carroll, 1992].
<p>
<li>Decentralised cooperation is a highly political form of aid. Most donor agencies seem poorly
      equipped to deal with this political dimension. At best, there is a tendency to see 'local
      politics' as a general contextual element. At worst, use is made of an idealised view of
      community participation and solidarity (e.g. the myth of 'spontaneous combustion' of
      people and ideas at grassroots level). Additional research will be needed on the role of
      foreign aid and its potential impact on the internal dynamics of civic associations and their
      capacity to contribute to democratisation [Robinson, 1995].
<p>
<li>Efforts at micro-level will yield little benefit in the absence of a conducive policy framework
      at macro and meso level. Development from below requires development from above.
      Donor agencies that are serious about decentralisation need to careful analyse the limits of
      this strategy and to provide adequate support to other levels of government as well.
      Additional research could provide guidance on how this can be done effectively.

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Greek Development Cooperation</h3>

Official development cooperation in Greece started in the late 1980s. It has a very low profile among the
media and the public, whose attention is focused on domestic economic problems. 
<p>
The volume of Greek official aid has risen sharply since its recent start. In 1991 total aid amounted to less
than US $ 4 million, while in 1993 it had risen to more then US $ 20 million. Greece still receives an
amount of ODA of more then US $ 30 million. Contributions are made to multilateral institutions and to EU
aid programmes. Greece is not a DAC-member.
<p>
<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>
<p>
Responsibility for the aid programme rests with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. In 1992 a Directorate for
Development Cooperation and Special Economic Affairs was set up within this Ministry. The Directorate
does not have the overall authority for development cooperation. In addition, departments of the Ministries
of Foreign Affairs, Trade, Finance and Education also deal with issues related to development cooperation
policy. Interministerial coordination of aid efforts and policy is presently wanting and technical expertise is
apparently low.
<p>
More than half of the aid volume is spent through a growing number of recently created private
organisations. These are mainly NGOs of which the Red Cross stands out by a wide margin. Aid from
NGOs has also been supported quite substantially by EU funding.
<p>
<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>
<p>
There is no advisory structure for development cooperation in Greece. The growing number of NGOs
involved in development cooperation are lobbying with the Government for a more clear and coherent
development cooperation policy. They are also concerned with raising public awareness of development
problems.
<p>
The Greek Parliament does not seem to take a great interest in the problems of the South, or the growing
aid budget of the Government. Not many questions are asked on the subject. Parliament does not receive an
annual report on development assistance.
<p>
<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>
<p>
There seems to be no research community focused on development cooperation. The ten Development
Research and Training Institutes mentioned by the 1991 OECD/EADI survey do not specialise in Third
World development problems.

<I>On rel&#232;ve, depuis 1992, une acc&#233;l&#233;ration des actions men&#233;es au plan mondial pour am&#233;liorer la conservation et la gestion durable des for&#234;ts. Cette Note d&#146;information traite des probl&#232;mes li&#233;s &#224; la d&#233;gradation des for&#234;ts et pr&#233;sente les grands traits du contexte politique et des approches strat&#233;giques de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement de la C.E. en mati&#232;re foresti&#232;re</I>. 
<p>
<H3>De l&#146;importance des for&#234;ts</H3>

L&#146;humanit&#233; tire de nombreux avantages des for&#234;ts: en bien des pays, les populations rurales -  et en particulier les plus pauvres en leur sein - d&#233;pendent des ressources foresti&#232;res pour une partie de leurs moyens d&#146;existence. Il y a aussi la demande nationale et internationale de biens et services fournis par les for&#234;ts, comme la protection des bassins-versants, les produits forestiers ligneux et non-ligneux, la diversit&#233; biologique et le stockage du carbone. Les for&#234;ts sont donc le si&#232;ge de valeurs multiples, dont un grand nombre ne pourraient &#234;tre obtenues &#224; partir d&#146;autres utilisations des terres. Or, ce sont ces &#233;l&#233;ments de mise en valeur qui sont en train d&#146;&#234;tre &#233;rod&#233;s.

<H3>Les probl&#232;mes</H3>

Partout dans le monde, les for&#234;ts sont en danger. Pendant les ann&#233;es 80, le d&#233;boisement des for&#234;ts tropicales s&#146;est d&#233;roul&#233;, selon la FAO, au rythme moyen de 15 millions d&#146;hectares (0,8 % de la couverture foresti&#232;re) par an. De surcro&#238;t, des millions d&#146; hectares suppl&#233;mentaires ont &#233;t&#233; d&#233;grad&#233;s sous l&#146;action de pratiques d&#146;abattage inappropri&#233;es et des collectes de bois &#224; br&#251;ler. Les for&#234;ts temp&#233;r&#233;es sont profond&#233;ment d&#233;grad&#233;es du fait de la pollution et d'une exploitation excessive. Tout cela a pour les arbres des cons&#233;quences imm&#233;diates, mais les probl&#232;mes ainsi engendr&#233;s concernent les humains. Au niveau plan&#233;taire, les principaux probl&#232;mes forestiers d&#146;ordre physique sont les suivants:
<ul>
<li><I>Le d&#233;clin quantitatif et qualitatif des for&#234;ts</I>. Il est d&#251; &#224; la r&#233;colte du bois, du combustible et de la nourriture &#224; des rythmes plus rapides que celui de la r&#233;g&#233;n&#233;ration foresti&#232;re, &#224; la fr&#233;quente mauvaise gestion des stocks forestiers subsistants et au d&#233;boisement int&#233;gral de nombreuses zones foresti&#232;res pour faire place &#224; d&#146;autres utilisations des terres.
<p>
<li><I>La d&#233;gradation environnementale des zones foresti&#232;res</I>. L&#146;exploitation des for&#234;ts et leur d&#233;boisement peuvent engendrer des probl&#232;mes interd&#233;pendants. Il s&#146;agit notamment de l&#146;&#233;rosion p&#233;dologique, de la d&#233;stabilisation des bassins-versants et du changement microclimatiques, autant de facteurs qui menacent la base p&#233;dologique et hydrologique de l&#146;agriculture. La pollution d&#146;origine industrielle de l&#146;atmosph&#232;re, particuli&#232;rement commune dans certaines for&#234;ts temp&#233;r&#233;es, affaiblit, elle aussi, la sant&#233; des zones foresti&#232;res.
<p>
<li><I>La perte de biodiversit&#233;</I>. Ces probl&#232;mes contribuent &#224; une r&#233;duction rapide de la diversit&#233; des &#233;cosyst&#232;mes et des esp&#232;ces ainsi que de la diversit&#233; g&#233;n&#233;tique; ce qui r&#233;duit le potentiel biologique mondial d&#146;am&#233;lioration de la production des mati&#232;res premi&#232;res, des aliments et des m&#233;dicaments. Comme les for&#234;ts tropicales repr&#233;sentent peut-&#234;tre la r&#233;serve majeure de biodiversit&#233;, les attaques qu&#146;elles subissent sont causes d&#146;une inqui&#233;tude particuli&#232;re.
<p>
<li><I>Le changement climatique</I>. Les for&#234;ts jouent un r&#244;le important dans le stockage du carbone. Il est probable que l&#146;impact cumul&#233; du r&#233;tr&#233;cissement plan&#233;taire des surfaces foresti&#232;res et de la d&#233;gradation de l&#146;environnement r&#233;sultera en une contribution nette au changement climatique r&#233;gional et mondial; ce qui pourrait aboutir &#224; de nombreux effets secondaires, tous probl&#233;matiques: hausse du niveau de la mer, mise en danger des fournitures d&#146;aliments, d&#233;clin de la productivit&#233; des sols et de la qualit&#233; et quantit&#233; d&#146;eau douce, non viabilit&#233; des utilisations actuelles des terres et des zones prot&#233;g&#233;es ainsi que probl&#232;mes de sant&#233; pour la population humaine.
<p></ul>
<H3>Qui ces probl&#232;mes concernent-ils?</H3>

Dans bien des pays, le remplacement ou l&#146;alt&#233;ration des for&#234;ts par d&#146;autres utilisations des terres ont eu des avantages au plan &#233;conomique et social. Plus pr&#233;cis&#233;ment, le d&#233;boisement &#224; des fins agricoles fut r&#233;alis&#233; d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;ment et a &#233;t&#233; consid&#233;r&#233; comme facteur de d&#233;veloppement, parce qu&#146;il permettait une meilleure s&#233;curit&#233; alimentaire ou qu&#146;il autorisait la pratique de cultures de rente. Il n&#146;en r&#233;sultait pas moins un certain nombre d&#146;inconv&#233;nients. Or le probl&#232;me tient au fait que ceux qui tirent avantage d&#146;un ph&#233;nom&#232;ne donn&#233; n&#146;en supportent g&#233;n&#233;ralement pas les inconv&#233;nients.Pour les populations, les principaux inconv&#233;nients sont les suivants:
<ul>
<li><I>La perte d&#146;un capital culturel et d&#146;un certain savoir</I>. La culture et les connaissances de nombreuses populations, n&#146;ayant pas toujours fait l&#146;objet d&#146;&#233;tudes ou d&#146;enregistrements et s&#146;&#233;tant d&#233;velopp&#233;es au cours de longues p&#233;riodes consacr&#233;es &#224; entretenir la for&#234;t, se perdent avec la r&#233;duction des surfaces foresti&#232;res, des possibilit&#233;s d&#146;y acc&#233;der et des droits traditionnels les concernant.
<p>
<li><I>La perte de moyens d&#146;existence</I>. L&#146;&#233;limination et la d&#233;gradation des for&#234;ts affectent les moyens d&#146;existence des populations qui en d&#233;pendent - en particulier les groupes plus pauvres, qui ne disposent pas de terres arables en quantit&#233; suffisante et n&#146;ont d&#146;autre &#171; s&#233;curit&#233; sociale &#187; que celle til&#233;e la for&#234;t.
<p>
<li><I>Des in&#233;galit&#233;s croissantes</I>. La concentration de plus en plus pouss&#233;e du contr&#244;le s&#146;exer&#231;ant sur les richesses foresti&#232;res et du droit &#224; y acc&#233;der retire &#224; la majorit&#233; de la population, en de nombreux pays, bien des options de d&#233;veloppement. Ceux qui perdent leurs moyens d&#146;existence forestiers et se retrouvent marginalis&#233;s risquent d&#146;&#234;tre forc&#233;s &#224; cr&#233;er ailleurs - dans les villes par exemple - des probl&#232;mes &#233;conomiques et sociaux.
</ul><p>
Chaque pays, et en son sein chaque for&#234;t, peut vivre une combinaison diff&#233;rente de probl&#232;mes relatifs au domaine forestier. Et ce sont les habitants des pays en d&#233;veloppement qui subissent de plein fouet ces probl&#232;mes. Or, le g&#226;chis des ressources foresti&#232;res se d&#233;roule au plan international et il faut chercher &#224; tous les niveaux -  local, national et mondial - les causes des probl&#232;mes forestiers.

<H3>Quelles en sont les causes?</H3>

Il importe de distinguer les facteurs directs des causes sous-jacentes. Les facteurs directs &#224; l&#146;origine des probl&#232;mes frappant les for&#234;ts tropicales sont: la culture sur br&#251;lis pratiqu&#233;e par les petits paysans; l&#146;agriculture s&#233;dentaire et la production de cultures de rente; le d&#233;boisement et le br&#251;lage pour faire place aux p&#226;turages; l&#146;exploitation foresti&#232;re; la r&#233;colte de bois de feu; le remplacement de for&#234;ts naturelles par des plantations; l&#146;implantation d&#146;infrastructures (mines, barrages, routes, etc...).
Il arrive souvent que plusieurs facteurs agissent conjointement. C&#146;est le cas, par exemple, du d&#233;veloppement du r&#233;seau routier, qui encourage l&#146;exploitation foresti&#232;re, laquelle oeuvre les for&#234;ts &#224; l&#146;occupation agricole et au ramassage du bois de feu. Presque la moiti&#233; des for&#234;ts tropicales exploit&#233;es pour leur bois finissent par &#234;tre enti&#232;rement d&#233;frich&#233;es par les agriculteurs. L&#146;importance relative de ces diff&#233;rents facteurs peut varier d&#146;une r&#233;gion du globe &#224; l&#146;autre: en Am&#233;rique Latine, l&#146;agriculture pr&#233;c&#232;de souvent les exploitations foresti&#232;res; en Asie du Sud-Est, il se peut qu&#146;&#224; cause de son intensit&#233;, l&#146;abattage des arbres soit la cause fondamentale de la d&#233;forestation.
<p>
Les causes profondes des probl&#232;mes forestiers sont plus complexes, plus enracin&#233;es. Il s&#146;agit des politiques et des &#171; signaux &#187; du march&#233; et des institutions, auxquels r&#233;agissent les facteurs directs du d&#233;boisement et de la d&#233;gradation des for&#234;ts. Nombre de ces signaux sont &#233;mis au plan national, au sein m&#234;me du secteur forestier ou en dehors de lui - surtout dans le cadre de l&#146;agriculture et du d&#233;veloppement industriel. Ils peuvent aussi r&#233;sulter des politiques macro-&#233;conomiques nationales. D&#146;autres signaux ont une origine locale et d&#233;coulent souvent d&#146;iniquit&#233;s fondamentales en mati&#232;re de droits et d&#146;acc&#232;s aux ressources. D&#146;autres enfin proviennent de la sc&#232;ne internationale: politiques commerciales, dettes et exigences d&#146;ajustement structurel.
<p>
De tels signaux tendent soit &#224; &#171; pousser &#187; les groupes humains &#224; p&#233;n&#233;trer dans les for&#234;ts, en cr&#233;ant des situations difficiles &#224; l&#146;ext&#233;rieur des for&#234;ts, soit &#224; &#171; attirer &#187; d&#146;autres groupes dans les for&#234;ts par l&#146;app&#226;t de profits excessifs. Nombreuses et diverses sont les politiques et conditions du march&#233; qui servent en fait &#224; sous-&#233;valuer la for&#234;t et n&#146;offrent aucune incitation &#224; long terme aux groupes &#171; pouss&#233;s &#187; ou &#171; attir&#233;s &#187; dans les for&#234;ts pour qu&#146;ils en entretiennent le patrimoine.

<H3>Pour une transition vers des for&#234;ts durables</H3>

Le d&#233;fi pos&#233; consiste &#224; traiter les causes profondes des probl&#232;mes forestiers et &#224; cr&#233;er les conditions susceptibles d&#146;encourager la reconnaissance et la gestion de ces ressources foresti&#232;res aux multiples &#233;l&#233;ments de mise en valeur. La transition vers une gestion foresti&#232;re durable exige une action au plan international, national et local. Depuis la fin des ann&#233;es 80, la C.E. et ses Etats membres ont pris un certain nombre d&#146;engagements d&#146;ordre interne et d&#146;ordre international, visant &#224; soutenir cette transition dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement.

<H3>Engagements internationaux de la C.E.</H3>

Au cours des ann&#233;es 80, la C.E. et ses &#201;tats membres se sont intens&#233;ment impliqu&#233;s et ont activement appuy&#233; la pr&#233;paration de deux grandes initiatives foresti&#232;res internationales: l&#146;Accord international sur les bois tropicaux (ITTA) et le Programme international d&#146;action foresti&#232;re tropicale. C&#146;est ainsi qu&#146;une vaste gamme d&#146;initiatives prises dans le cadre de ce dernier ont b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; de soutiens.
<p>
Le Sommet Plan&#232;te Terre, tenu &#224; Rio en 1992, a donn&#233; lieu, de la part de la C.E. et de ses &#201;tats membres, &#224; toute une floraison d&#146;engagements concernant les for&#234;ts: D&#233;claration de Rio sur l&#146;environnement et le d&#233;veloppement, programme d&#146;action &#171; Agenda 21 &#187;, Principes de Foresterie, Convention-cadre sur les changements climatiques et Convention sur la diversit&#233; biologique - et en 1994, la C.E. a sign&#233; la Convention de lutte contre la d&#233;sertification.
<p>
Les Principes de foresterie n&#146;ont pas force de loi mais repr&#233;sentent, pour la premi&#232;re fois, l&#146;&#233;tablissement d&#146;un consensus mondial touchant toutes les for&#234;ts et pas seulement celles situ&#233;es sous les tropiques. Ces principes forment un document politique o&#249; sont proclam&#233;es des valeurs g&#233;n&#233;rales. Ils exigent une gestion foresti&#232;re durable appliqu&#233;e &#224; tous les types de for&#234;ts, la m&#234;me importance devant &#234;tre accord&#233;e &#224; la conservation et au d&#233;veloppement. Ils ne constituent pas un plan op&#233;rationnel et ont besoin d&#146;&#234;tre interpr&#233;t&#233;s &#224; la lumi&#232;re de l&#146;Agenda 21, en particulier de son Chapitre consacr&#233; &#224; la d&#233;forestation.
<p>
Selon la Convention sur la biodiversit&#233;, il faut qu&#146;on mette en r&#233;serve, &#224; fin de conservation, de vastes superficies foresti&#232;res. Elle pr&#233;voit le partage des avantages issus de toute exploitation de la biodiversit&#233; foresti&#232;re. La Convention sur les changements climatiques insiste sur l&#146;importance du stockage du carbone dans les for&#234;ts existantes, sur son absorption par les for&#234;ts en croissance et sur les risques que pose le d&#233;boisement. Divers plans de mise en oeuvre conjointe ont suivi, aux termes desquels les d&#233;penses de conservation foresti&#232;re et de reboisement sont assum&#233;es par les entreprises productrices d&#146;&#233;lectricit&#233; afin de compenser une partie du co&#251;t &#233;cologique de leur production de CO2 (voir la Note d&#146;information No 6, consacr&#233;e au climat). La Convention sur la d&#233;sertification r&#233;clame des plans nationaux d&#146;action reconnaissant l&#146;importance des arbres et de la participation locale dans le traitement de la d&#233;gradation des zones arides.
<p>
En 1995, la Commission mondiale du d&#233;veloppement durable, institu&#233;e apr&#232;s Rio pour superviser la mise en oeuvre de l&#146;Agenda 21, a mis sur pied un Groupe Intergouvernemental sur les For&#234;ts, organe ad hoc avec pour objectif la promotion d&#146;une action pluridisciplinaire au plan international, conforme au Principes de Foresterie. La C.E. et ses &#201;tats-Membres prennent part &#224; de nombreux processus de discussion et de n&#233;gociation, dont les travaux viennent alimenter le Groupe. Celui-ci se compose de d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233;s gouvernementaux, avec, en observateurs, des groupes intergouvernementaux et des ONG. Il rendra compte &#224; la Commission en 1997.
<p>
Le second ITTA est entr&#233; en vigueur au d&#233;but de 1996. Tous les pays de l&#146;Union Europ&#233;enne ont fait savoir qu&#146;ils ratifieraient cet &#171; ITTA II &#187;, lequel exige, pour l&#146;an 2000, une gestion durable des for&#234;ts et un commerce se limitant aux seuls produits de sources durables.

<H3>La r&#233;ponse de la C.E. en mati&#232;re politique</H3>

La Communication de la Commission Europ&#233;enne au Conseil des ministres d&#146;Octobre 1989, relative &#224; la pr&#233;servation des for&#234;ts tropicales, a pr&#233;cis&#233; les principaux &#233;l&#233;ments de la strat&#233;gie de la C.E. en ce domaine, tandis que la R&#233;solution du conseil du d&#233;veloppement de mai 1990 sur les for&#234;ts tropicales a &#233;tabli les fondements de l&#146;emploi d&#146;instruments europ&#233;ens de d&#233;veloppement dans le cadre de la conservation des for&#234;ts tropicales. Le Parlement Europ&#233;en n&#146;a cess&#233; de faire pression sur la C.E. et sur les &#201;tats membres pour qu&#146;ils attribuent aux for&#234;ts tropicales une aide au d&#233;veloppement plus importante et de meilleure qualit&#233; et, en 1991, une ligne budg&#233;taire pour les for&#234;ts tropicales a &#233;t&#233; &#233;tablie. La conservation et la gestion foresti&#232;re durable figurent aussi comme th&#232;mes r&#233;currents  de la nouvelle g&#233;n&#233;ration d&#146;accords de coop&#233;ration bilat&#233;raux et r&#233;gionaux pass&#233;s avec les pays en d&#233;veloppement d&#146;Asie et d&#146;Am&#233;rique Latine(ALA).
<p>
Deux d&#233;veloppements survenus vers la fin de l&#146;ann&#233;e 1995 ont abouti &#224; de nouveaux engagements pris au sujet des for&#234;ts tropicales:
<ul>
<li>La quatri&#232;me Convention de Lom&#233; avec son Protocole sur la gestion durable des ressources foresti&#232;re voit dans la d&#233;forestation un grave probl&#232;me et souligne le besoin d&#146;action conjointe.  Le protocole d&#233;finit un certain nombre de domaines prioritaires en mati&#232;re d&#146;assistance: pr&#233;servation de la biodiversit&#233;, gestion durable des for&#234;ts productives, reboisement, d&#233;veloppement des capacit&#233;s locales et implantation de zones tampons. Une attention toute particuli&#232;re est accord&#233;e au r&#244;le important jou&#233; par les produits ligneux dans les &#233;conomies des &#201;tats ACP.
<p>
<li>L&#146;adoption par le Conseil du R&#232;glement relatif aux op&#233;rations de promotion des for&#234;ts tropicales. Ce texte fait &#233;tat de priorit&#233;s semblables &#224; celles contenues dans le nouveau protocole forestier de Lom&#233; et fournit une base juridique &#224; l&#146;ex&#233;cution des allocations issues de la ligne budg&#233;taire d'appui aux initiatives dans les zones foresti&#232;res tropicales.
<p></ul>
Suite &#224; un processus d&#146;&#233;laboration strat&#233;gique concert&#233;e, la C.E. pr&#233;pare actuellement une nouvelle Communication relative aux d&#233;veloppements et changements des centres d&#146;int&#233;r&#234;ts nationaux et internationaux depuis 1989. Dans la prochaine section, nous indiquons les domaines strat&#233;giques probablement mentionn&#233;s dans cette nouvelle Communication.

<H3>Comment la C.E. peut-elle apporter son soutien aux pays en voie de d&#233;veloppement?</H3>

Il faut s&#146;atteler &#224; mieux g&#233;rer les for&#234;ts sans attendre la conclusion des d&#233;bats en cours dans le monde entier sur ce qui constitue une &#171; gestion foresti&#232;re durable &#187;. On ne peut pas non plus attendre, avant d&#146;agir, que soient r&#233;unies toutes les conditions structurelles requises au niveau de chaque pays. Ce dont on a besoin, dans la plupart des pays, c&#146;est d&#146;une foresterie &#171; suffisamment durable &#187;, impliquant de choisir ce que l&#146;on doit faire durer - et au profit de qui. Il faut &#233;voluer en direction de ce type de gestion en utilisant des processus identifiant et prenant pour <A NAME="fig"></A>base des politiques et des pratiques qui donnent de bons r&#233;sultats. (<A HREF="fig10f.html">c.f. encadr&#233; 1</A>)
<p>
Dans la programmation et la planification de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement de la C.E., on doit prendre en consid&#233;ration les grandes approches suivantes:
<ul>
<li><I>Des processus mus par l&#146;int&#233;r&#234;t des pays concern&#233;s et une plus vaste participation aux prises de d&#233;cision.</I> Les processus de planification propres &#224; chaque pays en mati&#232;re d&#146;utilisation des for&#234;ts et des terres ont souvent besoin d&#146;appui: identification des d&#233;tenteurs d&#146;int&#233;r&#234;ts forestiers et de leurs perspectives; d&#233;veloppement d&#146;institutions telles que les tables rondes ou les commissions permanentes; m&#233;thodologies de r&#233;conciliation des pr&#233;tentions concurrentes et d&#146;&#233;laboration de consensus.
<p>
<li><I>Reconna&#238;tre les capacit&#233;s et &#233;laborer des options institutionnelles</I>
On distingue souvent mal les aptitudes potentielles &#224; r&#233;aliser une meilleure gestion foresti&#232;re. Les options organisationnelles reposant sur des r&#244;les n&#233;goci&#233;s pour les secteurs gouvernementaux et non-gouvernementaux ont besoin d&#146;&#234;tre soutenues, tout comme les approches qui, en mati&#232;re de formation &#224; la foresterie, produisent un genre nouveau d&#146;agent forestier, capable de traiter les multiples dimensions des for&#234;ts et d&#146;apporter sa m&#233;diation entre les diff&#233;rents groupes d&#146;int&#233;r&#234;ts.
<p>
<li><I>R&#233;orienter les influences dont l&#146;origine est &#233;trang&#232;re au secteur forestier</I>
Il faut soutenir les activit&#233;s int&#233;gratives des questions intersectorielles, qui poussent &#224; ce qu&#146;une meilleure gestion foresti&#232;re soit compl&#233;t&#233;e par des influences telles que: la politique macro-&#233;conomique,la fixation des prix et la commercialisation des produits agricoles, les politiques &#233;nerg&#233;tiques et les plans d&#146;occupation des terrains forestiers.
<p>
<li><I>Des processus et instruments politiques op&#233;rationnels</I>
Il faut soutenir les processus et institutions qui relient les politiques aux r&#233;alit&#233;s du terrain ainsi que les analyses des instruments, r&#232;glements et fiscalit&#233;s du march&#233; qui permettent la communication effective de la raret&#233; et de la valeur des ressources foresti&#232;res ainsi que de la totalit&#233; des co&#251;ts d&#146;exploitation des for&#234;ts.
<p>
<li><I>Garantir les droits et transf&#233;rer la gestion</I>
Les services administratifs exercent souvent un contr&#244;le th&#233;orique sur de vastes surfaces foresti&#232;res, tout en ne disposant que de maigres ressources pour les g&#233;rer. On a besoin de modalit&#233;s de soutien garantissant les droits des agriculteurs et des communaut&#233;s foresti&#232;res et mettant en valeur leurs aptitudes &#224; g&#233;rer les for&#234;ts: approches de travail en collaboration, aux niveaux locaux, entre organismes gouvernementaux, communaut&#233;s locales et secteur priv&#233;.
<p>
<li><I>Utilisations compl&#233;mentaires des terres</I>
On peut faire appel &#224; d&#146;autres syst&#232;mes d&#146;utilisation des terres pour r&#233;aliser des objectifs forestiers. On peut diss&#233;miner les &#233;l&#233;ments de mise en valeur des for&#234;ts sur l&#146;ensemble du paysage forestier et agricole en soutenant au niveau local la planification de l&#146;utilisation des terres et les syst&#232;mes d&#146;agriculture durable.
<p>
<li><I>Meilleure gestion op&#233;rationnelle des for&#234;ts</I>
Il se peut que les gouvernements aient besoin d&#146;aide pour &#233;tablir un domaine forestier national permanent. Il n&#146;est pas n&#233;cessaire qu&#146;il soit enti&#232;rement propri&#233;t&#233; de l&#146;&#201;tat, et une certaine assistance sera peut-&#234;tre requise pour la n&#233;gociation de niveaux de contr&#244;le appropri&#233;s, exerc&#233;s par les acteurs &#233;tatiques et priv&#233;s. Une gestion foresti&#232;re naturelle peut convenir &#224; des sites d&#233;j&#224; exploit&#233;s par les b&#251;cherons ou aux for&#234;ts d&#233;grad&#233;es, et il faudra accorder un soutien prioritaire aux initiatives &#224; base et sous contr&#244;le communautaire.
<p>
<li><I>Int&#233;grer au d&#233;veloppement la pr&#233;servation de la biodiversit&#233;</I>
En de nombreux pays, les for&#234;ts naturelles n&#146;occupent qu&#146;une surface limit&#233;e et nombre d&#146;entre elles devraient devenir des for&#234;ts de &#171; protection &#187;. Pourtant, les zones prot&#233;g&#233;es n&#146;ont des chances de rester viables que si elles sont soutenues dans le cadre d&#146;une int&#233;gration g&#233;n&#233;rale de la conservation au d&#233;veloppement. Cela peut impliquer l&#146;articulation des aires de protection aux zones d&#233;limit&#233;es dans l&#146;espace et pour un temps donn&#233; et attribu&#233;es au d&#233;veloppement d&#146;entreprises non gaspilleuses ou ne consommant les ressources que sur un mode durable.
<p>
<li><I>Reboisement et foresterie rurale</I>
Les plantations ne se substituent pas aux for&#234;ts naturelles-elles en sont le compl&#233;ment. L&#146;appui aux projets de plantations doit garantir des avantages sociaux et environnementaux , gr&#226;ce &#224; des programmes de foresterie rurale, des mosa&#239;ques int&#233;grant for&#234;ts naturelles et plantations et des plantations compos&#233;es d&#146;esp&#232;ces multiples. La meilleure fa&#231;on de soutenir la pr&#233;sence d&#146;arbres au sein des syst&#232;mes culturaux consiste, habituellement, &#224; offrir des conseils, du cr&#233;dit et des infrastructures et &#224; laisser aux paysans la gestion et les d&#233;cisions en mati&#232;re de commercialisation.
<p>
<li><I>Fili&#232;res locales, commerce et certification des for&#234;ts</I>
Les initiatives locales de mise en valeur, bas&#233;es sur du bois issu de for&#234;ts correctement g&#233;r&#233;es, peuvent jouer un r&#244;le important de stimulation du d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique et des perspectives d&#146;emploi. Un soutien pourra aussi s&#146;av&#233;rer n&#233;cessaire pour &#233;laborer un consensus autour d&#146;incitations reposant sur le march&#233; -  la certification, par exemple, qui peut aussi bien aboutir &#224; une meilleure s&#233;curit&#233; de march&#233; que permettre, si on la d&#233;veloppe avec soin, de relever le niveau de la gestion foresti&#232;re.
<p>
<li><I>Pour une meilleure utilisation de l&#146;information et de la recherche</I>
L&#146;information et la recherche consacr&#233;es &#224; une meilleure gestion foresti&#232;re sont encore bien minces en de nombreux pays, surtout au plan politique, juridique et institutionnel. Un soutien est n&#233;cessaire pour r&#233;aliser l&#146;alliance d&#146;une bonne d&#233;marche scientifique, de consid&#233;rations &#233;conomiques et d&#146;approches participatives, afin d&#146;obtenir et int&#233;grer aux cycles de politique et de planification les informations relatives aux for&#234;ts et aux &#233;l&#233;ments de leur mise en valeur.
</ul><p>
La C.E. et ses &#201;tats membres ont jou&#233; un r&#244;le majeur dans les initiatives internationales de lutte contre la d&#233;forestation et pour la d&#233;finition des implications d&#146;une gestion foresti&#232;re durable. Par ailleurs, l&#146;Europe est traditionnellement source des flux d&#146;aide les plus importants en mati&#232;re de foresterie. La nouvelle donne consacre une plus large participation &#224; la d&#233;termination des objectifs, une red&#233;finition des r&#244;les et un effort se basant sur les capacit&#233;s de gestion foresti&#232;re d&#146;un &#233;ventail d&#146;acteurs plus &#233;tendu. Elle repr&#233;sente ainsi un d&#233;fi que la Coop&#233;ration en Europe est bien plac&#233;e pour relever.

<I>Le gigantisme des probl&#232;mes urbains du Sud est bien connu. Selon l&#146;Organisation Mondiale de la Sant&#233;, 600 millions de gens au moins vivent dans des zones urbaines o&#249; l&#146;absence de services essentiels est telle, o&#249; le logement est d&#146;une qualit&#233; si mauvaise, que leurs vies et leur sant&#233; sont continuellement en danger. Pourtant, l&#146;image populaire d&#146;un grand nombre de m&#233;gapoles en proie &#224; une croissance incontr&#244;l&#233;e ne correspond pas &#224; la r&#233;alit&#233;.
<p>
Cette note d&#146;information souligne que les probl&#232;mes d&#146;environnement des zones urbaines ne sont pas tant le r&#233;sultat d&#146;une croissance d&#233;mographique rapide mais sont plut&#244;t dus &#224; la non-adaptation des gouvernements et des organismes d&#146;aide, dont les politiques ne correspondent pas &#224; une &#233;volution &#233;conomique, sociale et urbaine &#224; ce point rapide</I>. 
<p>
<H3>La population urbaine du Sud</H3>

En 1990, la population urbaine du Sud s&#146;&#233;levait &#224; 1,4 milliard de personnes, soit, d&#233;j&#224;, plus que toute la population d&#146;un ensemble qui regrouperait l&#146;Europe orientale et occidentale, la Russie, l&#146;Am&#233;rique du Nord et le Japon. Toutes les statistiques d&#233;mographiques portent, sauf indication contraire, sur l&#146;ann&#233;e 1990 puisque les donn&#233;es les plus r&#233;centes dont on dispose proviennent en g&#233;n&#233;ral de recensements effectu&#233;s entre 1989 et 1991. Presque toutes les statistiques urbaines pour 1995 sont des estimations ou des projections r&#233;alis&#233;es &#224; partir de donn&#233;es plus anciennes. Or elle ne repr&#233;sente pourtant que 35 % de la population totale du Sud. La majeure partie de cette population urbaine se trouve dans des agglom&#233;rations o&#249; habitent moins d&#146;un million d&#146;habitants (voir la Table 1). Dans une proportion consid&#233;rable, elle r&#233;side dans des petites villes de march&#233; et dans des centres o&#249; sont implant&#233;es des administrations locales et leurs services publics. Les m&#233;gapoles n&#146;abritent qu&#146;un petit pourcentage de la population totale du Sud et la plupart des pays sont d&#233;pourvus de ce type d&#146;agglom&#233;ration.
<p>
Outre la d&#233;mographie g&#233;n&#233;rale, l&#146;urbanisation est aussi &#233;troitement li&#233;e &#224; la croissance &#233;conomique. Les plus importantes concentrations de population urbaine, tout comme les plus grandes cit&#233;s, se trouvent au sein des &#233;conomies les plus importantes. Sur les huit m&#233;gapoles du Sud comptant en 1990 10 millions d&#146;habitants ou plus, six &#233;taient situ&#233;es dans les quatres &#233;conomies les plus puissantes: deux en Chine et en Inde et une au Br&#233;sil et au Mexique. Dans ces quatre pays se trouvent aussi pr&#232;s de la moiti&#233; de toutes les villes du Sud dont la population s&#146;&#233;l&#232;ve &#224; un million d&#146;habitant au moins. D&#146;une mani&#232;re g&#233;n&#233;rale, plus le revenu par t&#234;te d&#146;un pays est &#233;lev&#233;, plus son niveau d&#146;urbanisation l&#146;est aussi - et toutes les nations dont le revenu est le plus faible figurent aussi parmi les moins urbanis&#233;es.

<H3>Une urbanisation hors de contr&#244;le?</H3>

Presque toutes les r&#233;gions du Sud connaissent depuis 1950 une rapide croissance de leur population urbaine, avec de nouvelles formes de cit&#233;s, certaines aux dimensions encore jamais vues. La population a plus que d&#233;cupl&#233;e depuis 1950 dans des villes comme Abidjan, Amman, Brasilia, Dar-es-Salaam, Khartoum, Kinshasa, Lagos, Nairobi et S&#233;oul. Mais on observe aussi un &#233;l&#233;ment non n&#233;gligeable de continuit&#233;, puisque plus de la moiti&#233; des grandes cit&#233;s actuelles du Sud &#233;taient d&#233;j&#224; des villes importantes il y a deux si&#232;cles. Le rythme d&#146;urbanisation du Sud s&#146;est ralenti, surtout depuis les ann&#233;es 80. Des recensements r&#233;cents ont aussi d&#233;montr&#233; que les populations d&#146;un bon nombre des plus grandes villes du Sud &#233;taient moins importantes (avec une diff&#233;rence de plusieurs millions) que ce que n&#146;avaient laiss&#233; croire les estimations r&#233;alis&#233;es quelques ann&#233;es auparavant. La principale raison de cette divergence tiendrait &#224; la stagnation &#233;conomique, et de fait, presque tous les pays qui ont maintenu un rythme d&#146;urbanisation rapide pendant les ann&#233;es 80 furent ceux qui avaient enregistr&#233; une forte croissance &#233;conomique.

Quand les villes connaissent une croissance rapide, attirant des migrants en grand nombre, des changements &#233;conomiques, sociaux ou politiques la sous-tendent. L&#146;&#233;volution &#233;conomique est le facteur dominant qui influe sur le degr&#233; d&#146;urbanisation et sur la taille des villes. Dans la plupart des pays, l&#146;augmentation de la part de la population vivant en zones urbaines refl&#232;te celle de l&#146;&#233;conomie ainsi que l&#146;importance croissante d&#146;un secteur d&#146;activit&#233;s urbaines (industrie et services). L&#146;&#233;volution politique a aussi jou&#233; un r&#244;le important, surtout en Afrique sub-saharienne o&#249; la plupart des pays ne sont parvenus &#224; l&#146;ind&#233;pendance politique qu&#146;au cours des quarantes derni&#232;res ann&#233;es. L&#146;ind&#233;pendance a d&#146;ailleurs donn&#233; &#224;  l&#146;urbanisation une immense impulsion, car la plupart des r&#233;gimes coloniaux avaient d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;ment limit&#233; la taille d&#233;mographique des villes et c&#146;est aux nouveaux gouvernements ind&#233;pendants qu&#146;il est revenu de mettre en place les institutions n&#233;cessaires &#224; un &#201;tat-nation moderne. L&#146;expansion de l&#146;&#233;ducation sup&#233;rieure a aussi fortement contribu&#233; &#224; la croissance urbaine, ainsi que la possibilit&#233; nouvellement offerte aux femmes de venir vivre avec leurs conjoints, en amenant les enfants, dans les zones urbaines dont la plupart des r&#233;gimes coloniaux les avaient exclues ou avaient d&#233;courag&#233; leur pr&#233;sence afin de limiter la taille de la population urbaine ainsi que le co&#251;t du logement de la maind&#146;oeuvre citadine. Ainsi donc, une grande part de &#171;l&#146;explosion urbaine&#187; qu&#146;a connue l&#146;Afrique ces quarante derni&#232;res ann&#233;es est due au fait qu&#146;elle soit partie d&#146;une base exceptionnellement petite dans les ann&#233;es 50 et qu&#146;elle ait subi de telles contraintes. 
<p>
En Afrique sub-saharienne, l&#146;&#233;volution urbaine est souvent tenue pour &#171;incontr&#244;l&#233;e&#187;, mais l&#146;ampleur et l&#146;orientation des flux migratoires entre campagnes et villes sont le reflet de la situation g&#233;ographique des meilleures opportunit&#233;s &#233;conomiques (ou chances de survie). Nul ne conna&#238;t l&#146;ampleur actuelle de l&#146;&#233;volution urbaine dans une grande partie de l&#146;Afrique, car en bien des pays on ne dispose d&#146;aucun recensement et parce que les guerres et conflits internes ont provoqu&#233; des d&#233;placements de populations consid&#233;rables. Mais dans les pays pour lesquels on dispose de donn&#233;es d&#233;mographiques r&#233;centes, la plupart des grandes villes ont connu dans les ann&#233;es 80 des taux de croissance d&#233;mographique bien inf&#233;rieurs &#224; ceux des ann&#233;es 60 et 70, indice habituel de maigres performances &#233;conomiques, ainsi que de la mont&#233;e de la pauvret&#233; urbaine, reflet aussi des coupes subies par les effectifs des fonctionnaires (ou par le niveau de leurs salaires), pour cause d&#146;ajustement structurel. Les principales exceptions concernent des villes devenues d&#146;importants centres d&#146;attraction de r&#233;fugi&#233;s ou de personnes d&#233;plac&#233;es par les conflits et qui ont donc connu une croissance d&#233;mographique rapide sans croissance &#233;conomique.

<H3>Les d&#233;fis de l&#146;environnement urbain</H3>

La rapide croissance de la population urbaine s&#146;est produite sans entra&#238;ner l&#146;expansion, pourtant n&#233;cessaire, des installations et services essentiels &#224; un sain environnement urbain - eau courante, assainissement et drainage des eaux pluviales, voirie et trottoirs praticables quel que soit le temps, collecte et &#233;limination des d&#233;chets, &#233;coles et centres de sant&#233;, ainsi qu&#146;un nombre suffisant de sites d&#146;habitation viabilis&#233;s. Les moyens de la plupart des administrations urbaines et municipales ne se sont gu&#232;re d&#233;velopp&#233;s, m&#234;me quand le nombre de la population vivant dans leurs limites a &#233;t&#233; multipli&#233; plusieurs fois. Ces administrations, pour la plupart, ne disposent que d&#146;une capacit&#233; d&#146;investissement tr&#232;s limit&#233;e ou inexistante; nombre d&#146;entre elles ne peuvent m&#234;me pas pr&#233;server les infrastructures et services existants et encore moins les &#233;tendre et les am&#233;liorer. 
<p>
En cons&#233;quence, dans presque tous les centres urbains - des grandes villes et aires m&#233;tropolitaines aux centres r&#233;gionaux et petites villes de march&#233; - une importante proportion de la population r&#233;side dans des maisons et quartiers o&#249; peu ou rien n&#146;est pr&#233;vu en mati&#232;re d&#146;infrastructures et de services primaires. Ils sont nombreux, par ailleurs, &#224; occuper des logements de mauvaise qualit&#233; (il y a, par exemple, des familles enti&#232;res vivant dans une ou deux pi&#232;ces dans des habitations exigu&#235;s et surpeupl&#233;es: taudis, pensions bon march&#233; ou abris &#233;rig&#233;s sur des terrains ill&#233;galement occup&#233;s ou r&#233;partis. Dans la plupart des centres urbains ayant connu une croissance rapide, 30 &#224; 60 % de la population vit dans des implantations ill&#233;gales ou sauvages. En mati&#232;re d&#146;environnement, les villes du Sud sont confront&#233;es &#224; trois d&#233;fis urgents: le besoin d&#146;une profonde am&#233;lioration des amen&#233;es d&#146;eau, de l&#146;assainissement ainsi que de la collecte et &#233;limination des d&#233;chets solides; la diminution d&#146;autres risques environnementaux, causes majeures de maladies, d&#146;accidents et de d&#233;c&#232;s pr&#233;coces; la r&#233;duction des discriminations d&#146;ordre sexuel dans les soins de sant&#233; et la fourniture de services.
<ul> 
<li><B>AMEN&#201;E D&#146;EAU</B>: Des centaines de millions d&#146;urbains n&#146;ont toujours pas le choix et doivent utiliser une eau contamin&#233;e ou dont la qualit&#233; n&#146;est pas garantie. Leur eau provient g&#233;n&#233;ralement de ruisseaux ou d&#146;autres sources en surface qui ne sont souvent rien d&#146;autre que des &#233;gouts &#224; ciel ouvert, &#224; moins qu&#146;ils ne l&#146;ach&#232;tent &#224; des vendeurs sans garantie de qualit&#233; et &#224; un prix au litre habituellement plusieurs fois sup&#233;rieur &#224; celui acquitt&#233; par les foyers plus riches pour l&#146;eau courante fournie par le secteur pu-blic. Ils sont des centaines de millions &#224; d&#233;pendre de sources d&#146;approvisionnement plus s&#251;res mais encore incommodes: fontaines publiques, robinets de cour ou puits. Il n&#146;y a souvent qu&#146;un seul robinet ou une seule pompe pour approvisionner des douzaines, voire m&#234;me des centaines de m&#233;nages. De longues files d&#146;attente au robinet public (surtout s&#146;il ne fonctionne que quelques heures par jour) ainsi que les trajets r&#233;p&#233;t&#233;s qu&#146;il faut faire en portant des r&#233;cipients entre la maison et le point d&#146;eau absorbent beaucoup de temps, un temps qu&#146;on pourrait consacrer &#224; gagner de l&#146;argent. Cela emp&#234;che aussi de prendre assez d&#146;eau pour la toilette, la vaisselle et la lessive.
<p>
<li><B>ASSAINISSEMENT</B>: Le tiers, au moins, de la population urbaine du Sud ne dispose pas d&#146;installations sanitaires. Beaucoup de gens vont &#224; la selle en pleine rue ou dans des sites sans enceinte. Une proportion encore plus importante ne dispose pas de sanitaires ad&#233;quats, par quoi nous voulons dire des W.C. minimisant le risque de contact humain avec les excr&#233;ments et faciles &#224; nettoyer. Plus des trois cinqui&#232;mes de la population urbaine n&#146;est pas reli&#233;e aux r&#233;seaux publics d&#146;&#233;gouts. Et il ne s&#146;agit pas seulement des cit&#233;s les plus petites: un grand nombre de villes comptant un million d&#146;habitants ou plus n&#146;ont pas le moindre &#233;gout. Les statistiques officielles d&#146;amen&#233;e d&#146;eau et d&#146;assainissement exag&#232;rent grandement la proportion d&#146;urbains b&#233;n&#233;ficiant de services ad&#233;quats. Ainsi, par exemple, l&#146;administration enregistre souvent comme b&#233;n&#233;ficiant d&#146;une amen&#233;e d&#146;eau ad&#233;quate des m&#233;nages oblig&#233;s, en fait, de partager des robinets publics avec des douzaines d&#146;autres foyers, les robinets &#233;tant &#224; une certaine distance de leur maison et fr&#233;quemment hors d&#146;usage. Des millions de m&#233;nages figurant, selon l&#146;administration, parmi ceux qui ont acc&#232;s &#224; des sanitaires ne disposent en fait que de simples fosses latrines - chacune de ces latrines &#233;tant souvent partag&#233;e avec des douzaines de familles. Quand elles ne sont pas nettoy&#233;es et entretenues r&#233;guli&#232;rement -ce qui est souvent le cas - se servir de pareilles latrines peut repr&#233;senter un risque sanitaire plus grave que de d&#233;f&#233;quer au dehors. Et tant de personnes vont &#224; la selle en plein air que cela cause de tr&#232;s graves probl&#232;mes de sant&#233; pour tous ceux qui habitent dans leur voisinage.
 <p>
<li><B>D&#201;CHETS SOLIDES</B>: La plupart des autorit&#233;s urbaines n&#233;gligent de faire enlever entre un tiers et la moiti&#233; des d&#233;chets solides produits par les m&#233;nages et les entreprises commerciales. Dans de nombreux centres urbains d&#146;Afrique sub-saharienne, seuls 10 &#224; 20 % des d&#233;chets solides sont collect&#233;s. La plupart des &#233;tablissements humains ill&#233;gaux ne sont desservis par aucun ser-vice d&#146;enl&#232;vement des ordures. Les d&#233;chets abandonn&#233;s s&#146;accumulent dans les espaces libres et au long des rues ou dans les caniveaux, causant de graves probl&#232;mes de sant&#233;. Ils obturent les foss&#233;s de drainage et donnent plus d&#146;ampleur aux inondations; ils fournissent &#224; de nombreux vecteurs de pathologies un terrain propice &#224; leur reproduction et &#224; leur alimentation.
<p>
<li><B>AUTRES RISQUES ENVIRONNEMENTAUX</B>: Une grande partie de la population urbaine souffre aussi de maladies respiratoires et autres, caus&#233;es ou exacerb&#233;es par la pr&#233;sence dans l&#146;air d&#146;&#233;l&#233;ments biologiques ou chimiques: polluants de l&#146;atmosph&#232;re int&#233;rieure dus &#224; l&#146;emploi de charbon ou de biomasse combustible dans des foyers non couverts ou dans des fourneaux mal ventil&#233;s; pollution de l&#146;air ambiant due aux &#233;missions de l&#146;industrie, des centrales thermiques et des v&#233;hicules &#224; moteur. Une forte proportion de la population urbaine se trouve par ailleurs expos&#233;e, dans les maisons et lieux de travail, &#224; des dangers d&#146;origine chimique et physique qui pourraient &#234;tre &#233;vit&#233;s. Rares sont les gouvernements donnant priorit&#233; &#224; la promotion de la sant&#233; et de la s&#233;curit&#233; au travail ou &#224; l&#146;application de la l&#233;gislation de lutte contre la pollution atmosph&#233;rique et aquatique. Seuls un petit nombre de centres industriels b&#233;n&#233;ficient d&#146;une attention suffisante accord&#233;e au traitement et au stockage en s&#233;curit&#233; des d&#233;chets dangereux. Ce manque d&#146;attention dont souffre le contr&#244;le de la pollution a souvent de graves cons&#233;quences &#233;cologiques pour l&#146;ensemble de la r&#233;gion concern&#233;e. On songe, par exemple, &#224; la pollution aquatique qui endommage ou d&#233;truit les p&#234;cheries locales ou, dans le cas de grands centres industriels, aux pluies acides nocives pour la v&#233;g&#233;tation et les plans d&#146;eau.
<p>
<li><B>SANT&#201;</B>: Dans la plupart des zones urbaines du Sud, un fardeau immense d&#146;accidents et de maladies p&#232;se sur la population alors qu&#146;on pourrait ais&#233;ment l&#146;&#233;viter. Il est d&#251; aux carences, d&#233;j&#224; mentionn&#233;es, du logement, de l&#146;amen&#233;e d&#146;eau, de l&#146;assainissement et du drainage, alli&#233;es &#224; des dispositifs de sant&#233; publique inad&#233;quats ou inexistants. C&#146;est tout sp&#233;cialement le cas de la majeure partie de l&#146;Afrique sub-saharienne et des nations &#224; faible revenu d&#146;Asie et d&#146;Am&#233;rique Latine. Par exemple, les estimations r&#233;centes r&#233;alis&#233;es par la Banque Mondiale et l&#146;Organisation Mondiale de la Sant&#233; sugg&#232;rent que le fardeau pathologique d&#251; aux maladies diarrh&#233;iques subi par chaque personne vivant en Afrique sub-saharienne p&#232;se 200 fois plus lourd qu&#146;en Europe ou en Am&#233;rique du Nord.
<p>
<li><B>SEXES</B>: Les femmes souffrent en g&#233;n&#233;ral plus que les hommes de la mauvaise qualit&#233; des logements et de leur surpeuplement ainsi que des carences des infrastructures et des services essentiels, parce qu&#146;elle sont seules (ou principalement) responsables de l&#146;&#233;ducation des enfants et de la gestion du foyer.Ce sont elles, par exemple, qui sont en g&#233;n&#233;ral charg&#233;es d&#146;apporter l&#146;eau et qui en ont besoin pour faire la lessive, cuisiner et laver les enfants, si bien que leur t&#226;che se trouve alourdie si l&#146;eau est contamin&#233;e ou difficile &#224; obtenir. G&#233;n&#233;ralement, ce sont des femmes (ou des jeunes filles) qui alimentent les feux et font la cuisine, si bien que lorsque des combustibles fumig&#232;nes sont utilis&#233;s dans des foyers non couverts et dans des fourneaux mal ventil&#233;s, ce sont elles qui inhalent les plus grandes concentrations de polluants. Une grande part de la population urbaine du Sud ne dispose d&#146;aucun service de sant&#233; implant&#233; localement, ce qui aggrave beaucoup les probl&#232;mes auxquels sont confront&#233;s les personnes se chargeant de prendre soin des membres de la famille malades ou bless&#233;s. De cette t&#226;che aussi les femmes sont habituellement responsables. L&#146;absence de soins de sant&#233; - ou la pr&#233;sence d&#146;un syst&#232;me de soins de sant&#233; ne traitant pas les besoins des m&#232;res de famille - est cause sous-jacente de taux tr&#232;s &#233;lev&#233;s de mortalit&#233; maternelle. Dans certains pays, la proportion de femmes qui d&#233;c&#232;dent en cours de parturition est 1000 fois sup&#233;rieure &#224; celle du Nord. En cons&#233;quence, chaque ann&#233;e, des millions d&#146;enfant se retrouvent sans m&#232;re, ce qui diminue de beaucoup, bien &#233;videmment, leurs chances de jouir d&#146;un d&#233;veloppement sain.
</ul>
<H3>Le besoin d&#146;une bonne administration</H3>

La cause principale des probl&#232;mes urbains d&#233;crits ci-dessus ne tient pas &#224; l&#146;ampleur de la croissance d&#233;mographique mais &#224; l&#146;incapacit&#233; des gouvernements et agences d&#146;aide qui ne savent pas &#233;laborer des politiques appropri&#233;es. Ce dont tous les pays ont besoin, ce sont des autorit&#233;s urbaines et municipales dont les capacit&#233;s, la comp&#233;tence et la responsabilit&#233; en mati&#232;re de gestion du d&#233;veloppement urbain, ne cessent de se d&#233;velopper. On entend par l&#224; le pouvoir et le cadre institutionnel permettant de contr&#244;ler la pollution, guider la croissance urbaine, pr&#233;server le tissu urbain et assurer que les infrastructures et les services publics se d&#233;veloppent de mani&#232;re &#224; satisfaire les besoins d&#146;une population croissante. Il n&#146;en a pas &#233;t&#233; ainsi, et ce pour des raisons qui varient selon les pays:
<ul>
<li>l&#146;&#233;chec des gouvernements post-coloniaux d&#146;une grande partie de l&#146;Afrique et de l&#146;Asie, qui ne sont pas parvenus &#224; modifier un h&#233;ritage colonial fait de lois, d&#146;institutions et de structures totalement inad&#233;quates &#224; la r&#233;solution de pareils probl&#232;mes;   
<li>la mauvaise volont&#233; manifest&#233;e par les gouvernements nationaux d&#232;s qu&#146;il s&#146;est agi de laisser les autorit&#233;s urbaines et municipales d&#233;velopper les capacit&#233;s, la comp&#233;tence et les revenus dont elles avaient besoin pour traiter les probl&#232;mes urbains;   
<li>l&#146;imposition de &#171;solutions&#187; import&#233;es du Nord et qui se sont av&#233;r&#233;es mal choisies au regard des priorit&#233;s et situations locales;  
<li>le refus d&#146;investir dans les zones urbaines, d&#251; &#224; la conviction (en g&#233;n&#233;ral infond&#233;e) que les investissements <A NAME="n1"></A>(<A HREF="#1">note 1</A>) en mati&#232;re de d&#233;veloppement sont biais&#233;s en faveur des villes ou que l&#146;am&#233;lioration des conditions de vie et de logement en ville risque d&#146;aboutir &#224; un surcro&#238;t de migrations de la campagne &#224; la ville <A NAME="n2"></A>(<A HREF="#1">note 2</A>); 
<li>l&#146;absence d&#146;encouragement et de soutien aux initiatives de communaut&#233;s ou de voisinages - m&#234;me quand elles peuvent amplement contribuer &#224; la r&#233;duction des probl&#232;mes, pour un co&#251;t relativement faible et sans faire lourdement appel aux moyens limit&#233;s du gouvernement.
</ul><p>
Dans les pays au revenu le plus faible, les probl&#232;mes urbains ne seront r&#233;solus dans le long terme que quand les gouvernements et les agences d&#146;aide auront trouv&#233; les moyens de soutenir les initiatives prises par des individus, des m&#233;nages, des communaut&#233;s et des municipalit&#233;s pour &#233;laborer des solutions correspondant aux priorit&#233;s et aux besoins locaux et faisant le meilleur usage du savoir autochtone et des ressources locales. 
<p>
La &#171;bonne administration&#187;, avec l&#146;accent qu&#146;elle met sur une responsabilit&#233; et une d&#233;centralisation accrues, peut aussi r&#233;duire la concentration de la population urbaine dans les capitales nationales. Une cause de la taille souvent tr&#232;s sup&#233;rieure des capitales nationales, par rapport aux autres centres urbains, tient &#224; la nature fortement centralis&#233;e des gouvernements et au besoin des entreprises d&#146;avoir des contacts personnels &#233;troits avec les hommes politiques et hauts fonctionnaires &#224; dimension nationale. En renfor&#231;ant la comp&#233;tence et les capacit&#233;s des autorit&#233;s municipales des villes secondaires, on contribuera aussi &#224; garantir &#224; leur cit&#233; la possibilit&#233; de concurrencer les capitales dans la course aux nouveaux investissements.

<H3>Les villes ont des avantages</H3>

Les cit&#233;s disposent d&#146;un potentiel &#233;norme pour allier des niveaux de vie &#233;lev&#233;s &#224; des styles de vie consommant peu d&#146;&#233;nergie, employant peu de ressources et n&#146;engendrant qu&#146;un gaspillage r&#233;duit. Comme les villes sont des concentr&#233;s de production et de population, elles ont des avantages &#233;vidents par rapport aux &#233;tablissements humains ruraux ou aux populations dispers&#233;es.
<ul>
<li>Des densit&#233;s d&#233;mographiques &#233;lev&#233;es impliquent des co&#251;ts moindres par foyer pour l&#146;obtention d&#146;une eau courante trait&#233;e, de la collecte et l&#146;&#233;limination des ordures m&#233;nag&#232;res et des effluents humains, de t&#233;l&#233;communications de pointe et de la plupart des formes de services de sant&#233;, d&#146;&#233;ducation et d&#146;urgence.
<li>La concentration de la production et de la consommation des villes favorise aussi l&#146;existence d&#146;une plus vaste gamme et d&#146;une meilleure possibilit&#233; d&#146;utilisations efficaces des ressources - par la r&#233;cup&#233;ration des mat&#233;riaux, leur recyclage et leur r&#233;utilisation et gr&#226;ce aux entreprises sp&#233;cialis&#233;es aptes &#224; assurer que ces activit&#233;s se d&#233;roulent sans risque.  
<li>Une densit&#233; d&#233;mographique urbaine bien plus &#233;lev&#233;e qu&#146;ailleurs a pour cons&#233;quence une r&#233;duction de la demande de terre par rapport au nombre de la population. Dans la plupart des pays, les zones urbaines occupent moins d&#146;un pour cent du territoire national.  
<li>Les villes sont potentiellement bien mieux aptes &#224; limiter l&#146;emploi des v&#233;hicules &#224; moteur et des combustibles fossiles dont ils ont besoin, car elles favorisent la marche ou la bicyclette ou un usage plus pouss&#233; des transports en commun.
</ul>
<H3>Construire les cit&#233;s en partant de la base</H3>

Dans le Sud, la plupart des nouvelles zones de logement et aires r&#233;sidentielles du domaine urbain sont &#171;&#233;rig&#233;es &#224; partir de la base&#187; par des groupes &#224; faible revenu - m&#234;me si les gouvernements consid&#232;rent ces efforts comme &#171;ill&#233;gaux&#187;. Ces derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, de nombreux gouvernements se sont faits plus tol&#233;rants. Certains m&#234;me ont cherch&#233; &#224; soutenir ce processus, ce qui peut aboutir &#224; des am&#233;liorations majeures des conditions de vie et de la qualit&#233; de l&#146;environnement, pour un co&#251;t relativement faible. Les exp&#233;riences pass&#233;es de soutiens de ce type ont d&#233;bouch&#233; sur d&#146;importantes le&#231;ons, dont les suivantes:
<ul>    
<li>les interventions d&#146;origine ext&#233;rieure doivent &#234;tre guid&#233;es par les priorit&#233;s et besoins des habitants et tenir compte des limites du temps et des ressources qu&#146;ils peuvent apporter;
<li>il n&#146;y a pas de mod&#232;le reproductible - bien qu&#146;existent des principes communs. Dans chaque squat, dans chaque lotissement &#233;tabli en d&#233;pit des r&#232;glements ou dans chaque district de taudis, la population aura des besoins et priorit&#233;s sp&#233;cifiques et variant d&#146;un cas &#224; l&#146;autre;    
<li>en cas de r&#233;ussite, les projets enracin&#233;s dans les communaut&#233;s ne se contentent pas d&#146;atteindre des objectifs tangibles: ils renforcent aussi la confiance des habitants en eux-m&#234;mes ainsi que leur capacit&#233; d&#146;organisation, facteurs essentiels pour le maintien d&#146;un progr&#232;s continu.
</ul><p>     
Soutenir la &#171;construction des villes &#224; partir de la base&#187; implique non seulement l&#146;adoption de nouvelles priorit&#233;s par les agences ext&#233;rieures, mais aussi qu&#146;il leur faut disposer de moyens nouveaux pour rendre cet appui tangible. Un nouveau mod&#232;le d&#146;assistance fait l&#146;objet actuellement d&#146;un vaste d&#233;bat. Il s&#146;agit d&#146;un fonds pouvant soutenir une grande vari&#233;t&#233; d&#146;initiatives, dont un grand nombre ne requi&#232;rent qu&#146;un financement tr&#232;s modeste. Il faut d&#146;ailleurs qu&#146;un pareil fonds soit capable de r&#233;pondre avec c&#233;l&#233;rit&#233; aux demandes de financement. Il peut aussi se trouver dans l&#146;obligation d&#146;aider les groupes communautaires dans l&#146;&#233;laboration de leurs propositions et demandes de financement. Pour les donateurs, par cons&#233;quent, les deux t&#226;ches prioritaires dans le champ urbain sont, en premier lieu, l&#146;accroissement de la capacit&#233;, de la comp&#233;tence et de la responsabilit&#233; des administrations urbaines et municipales et, en second lieu, l&#146;appui direct plus pouss&#233; qu&#146;il leur faut accorder aux organisations et initiatives des communaut&#233;s ou quartiers. Ces deux priorit&#233;s peuvent avoir des horizons &#233;conomiques, sociaux et environnementaux conjoints. Toutes deux conviennent aux grandes cit&#233;s comme aux petits bourgs. Elles correspondent bien &#224; la section de Lom&#233; IV qui met l&#146;accent sur une approche int&#233;gr&#233;e de l&#146;environnement et du d&#233;veloppement ainsi qu&#146;au besoin de renforcer les capacit&#233;s institutionnelles locales. Elles sont aussi bien en phase avec l&#146;accent mis par le document Action 21 sur la constitution de capacit&#233;s (dont le besoin que chaque centre urbain &#233;tablisse au plan local son propre document de type &#171;Action 21&#187;) et avec les avant-projets du plan mondial d&#146;action pour la seconde conf&#233;rence des Nations unies sur les &#233;tablissements humains (Habitat II) qui doit se r&#233;unir &#224; Istanbul en juin 1996.

<A NAME="1"></A><H3>Notes</H3>

Note 1. Dans la plupart des pays, seules les grandes cit&#233;s (et souvent, la capitale nationale seulement) ont profit&#233; de ce biais urbain; la plupart des petits centres urbains ont &#233;t&#233; autant priv&#233;s que les zones rurales de l&#146;investissement et du soutien publics. Par ailleurs, ce sont les groupes aux revenus moyens et sup&#233;rieurs qui ont &#233;t&#233; les principaux b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires d&#146;un pareil biais. <A HREF="#n1">Retour</A>.
<p>
Note 2. Dans presque tous les pays ACP et dans la plupart des autres, ce sont de meilleures opportunit&#233;s &#233;conomiques en zone urbaine, ou de meilleures chances de survie, qui sous-tendent ce genre d&#146;exode rural. L&#146;am&#233;lioration des services essentiels en zones urbaines ne poussera pas &#224; l&#146;augmentation du flux migratoire entre campagne et ville tandis qu&#146;elle contribuera &#224; l&#146;abaissement du taux de fertilit&#233; dans les zones urbaines. Cela ne veut pas dire pour autant qu&#146;il faut accorder une priorit&#233; absolue aux services essentiels des zones urbaines; il vaut mieux donner la priorit&#233;, une priorit&#233; &#233;gale, aux services essentiels tant dans les zones rurales qu&#146;urbaines. <A HREF="#n2">Retour</A>.

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Dutch Development Cooperation</h3>

The Netherlands development cooperation is based on several types of motives. The importance attached to
new international relations in foreign policy after a colonial past, a strong religious sense of solidarity with
poor people, and commercial motives relating to the position and economic characteristics of the
Netherlands. Official bilateral development cooperation started in the early sixties, built also on a long and
active church-related NGO-tradition and on an active and critical governmental support since World War II
for the functioning of the UN institutions. The first Minister for Development Cooperation was appointed in
1965. Parliamentary and public support for development cooperation has always been very strong, and at the
same time watchful. The Dutch media play an active role in public monitoring. Although domestic issues
appear to become more predominant in the attention of the public, a large part of the population is actively
and often personally involved in development cooperation. 
<p>
Net official development assistance of the Netherlands in 1992 amounted to US $ 2 753 million, being 0.86
per cent of GNP. Multilateral disbursements amounted to about one-third of ODA over the years, usually
equally shared by the UN, the Bretton Woods institutions and the EU. Multilateral ODA grew in 1991 and
1992, recovering the earlier one third share (23 per cent of ODA plus 9 per cent to the EU in 1992), but
dropped in 1993 to an estimated 28 per cent of ODA. 
<p>
Presently a discussion is conducted about the future contents and financial targets for Dutch development
cooperation. In 1967 the Netherlands have set themselves a total aid budget target (the 'ceiling') of 1 per
cent of the net national income (NNI), in 1977 set at 1.5 per cent of NNI (roughly 1.2 per cent of Dutch
GNP). Since 1990 a decrease set in and a growing number of other expenses that "contaminated" ODA and
non-ODA parts of budget: growing emergency aid to non-DAC countries, aid for Eastern European
countries, peace-keeping activities and reception and care of refugees in the Netherlands. The actual total
'ceiling' in 1993 reached 1.39 per cent of NNI (= 1.10 % of GNP) including 0.81 % of GNP for ODA
with an estimation for 1994 of 1.42 per cent NNI (0.8 per cent of GNP). In 1992 the ceiling was left. These
developments resulted in an effective reduction of the available volume for assistance to developing
countries.
<p>
<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>
<p>
The Netherlands' official development cooperation is not laid down in an organic law. It started in 1964 as
an annex to the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, of which it still a part. The Minister for
Development Cooperation is a Cabinet Minister without portfolio; he has no budget or staff of his own. The
Ministry of Foreign Affairs includes a Directorate-General for International Cooperation (DGIS). Officials at
the DGIS are integrated with the Dutch Foreign Service. Parts of the development budget of DGIS are
implemented by the Cabinet of Netherlands-Antilles and Aruban Affairs, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
and by the eleven other ministries. Voluntary multilateral contributions are under the responsibility of the
Minister of Finance, but only after consulting the Minister for Development Cooperation).  
<p>
The core structure of the DGIS is a three-dimensional matrix, organised around sectors, countries and
channels (bilateral, multilateral and NGOs), supplemented by functional departments and sub-departments
according to specific implementation modalities. The total lay out reflecting the firm (and sometimes
complex) set of objectives, points of attention, criteria and tests per programme, project and country. Over
the years the administrational set-up of the DGIS has been changed several times, under influence of
changing policy priorities and efforts to improve efficiency, effectiveness and financial accountability. Since
some time actions are undertaken to simplify procedures.
<p>
Preparation, formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of activities are, for the majority,
either sub-contracted to external consultants, firms or independent institutions and NGOs, or to several -
government related- institutions. Moreover, the Netherlands promote spending of cooperation funds in the
Third World, use and support local capacity and follow Europe-wide tendering procedures. The Government
intends to focus more on priorities set by developing countries, and on local implementation and capacity
building. Among the government funded organisations that implement specific programmes are: the Centre
for the Promotion of Imports from Developing Countries (CBI) that stimulates imports into Europe from
LDCs; the Netherlands Finance Company for Developing Countries (FMO), a bank for the development of
the private sector in the Third World; the SNV-Netherlands Development Organisation for project and
personnel assistance. A number of government programmes exist with a wide range of NGOs for various
policy areas, based on long term block grant contracts (see further 3. Other Actors). For emergency aid
Dutch and international NGOs are sub-contracted. Direct funding by the DGIS to NGOs in the Third World
and to International NGO-networks does occur. The DGIS has programmes for cooperation with Dutch
industry and banks, that are relatively limited in volume and number. The Netherlands Investment Bank for
Developing Countries (NIO) handles financial programme aid for which the developing country concerned
has full executive responsibility.  
<p>
The Policy Planning Section of the DGIS concentrates on long term strategic policies as well as mid and
long term budget planning. Country and sector policies are designed at the desks concerned with a large
input from the embassies and local expertise. Approximately 70 sector specialists and technical advisers
have been appointed at embassies and at the DGIS. Within the DGIS matrix many consultations take place
between the various departments, with or without external advisers and/or on the basis of external studies.
Implementation of the earlier mentioned policy changes generates a greater need for internal and external
policy coordination.
<p>
There are several instruments for coordination of the Netherlands development policy. International
environmental concern and peace-keeping activities are increasingly becoming subjects for interministerial
policy coordination. Besides the bilateral consultations between the DGIS and the ministries on the above
mentioned budget items for which the Minister for Development Cooperation acts as policy coordinator, two
important interministerial committees operate. Ministers who are responsible for a certain policy area that is
subject to interministerial coordination, cannot take a decision without consulting other ministers, or without
discussion in the Cabinet. The Minister for Development Coordination is responsible for coordination of
development policy. He appoints the members of the Interministerial Coordination Committee for
development Cooperation (COCOS), which prepares the discussions for the Ministerial Council for
Development Cooperation (ROS) that is chaired by the Prime Minister. Both committees meet frequently.
The Minister for Development Cooperation is also a member of the Council for Economic Affairs that
prepares Cabinet discussions about economic, financial, monetary and social policy. DGIS participates in
meetings of the Council for Trade Policy and in the Coordinating Committee on International Environment
Issues. 
<p>
The Independent Operations Review Unit (IOV) at the DGIS reports directly to the Minister. IOV reports
are sent to Parliament, and they are translated and published. IOV activities are to be distinguished from
ongoing project and programme evaluations (annually: 150) which are an obligatory component of the
project cycle. IOV studies influence DGIS policy. 
<p>
<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>
<p>
In 1964 the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) was installed, following the
example of the Belgium Government. Its installation was motivated by the wish to develop a consistent
development cooperation policy and to involve as many sections of Dutch society as possible in its aid
policy. The Council provides policy and scientific advice to the Minister for Development Cooperation, and
through him or her to the Netherlands Government. As a Sector Council for development cooperation, the
NAR may address its recommendations also to other Ministers. The Council generally advises on topics of
mid- to long term policy. Occasionally matters of more immediate relevance are treated. After its installation
in 1964, the Council used to comment on the annual budget for development cooperation.
<p>
The NAR has 70 members, who are appointed on the basis of their personal expertise, their active interest
in development cooperation, and their availability for advisory work. NAR members come from many
sectors of Dutch society, a.o. industry and banks, religious organisations, politics, universities and research
institutes, labour unions. The composition of the Council is meant to include the ideas on development held
in Dutch society as a whole. The chairperson and the members of the Council are appointed by the Minister
for Development Cooperation for a period of four years, after which they can be reappointed. The NAR
may make reports on its own initiative or at the request of the Minister; around 80 % of the NAR reports
were prepared on request by the various ministers. Thus the NAR may be considered to have two main
functions, 1) to provide information not directly available at the DGIS, and 2) to function as a bridge
between government and society. The functions of chairperson, vice-chairperson and special activities of
NAR-members are renumerated.
<p>
The NAR is assisted by an official secretariat, which forms part of the Policy Planning Section of the DGIS.
At the secretariat, headed by a Secretary, currently work five persons. The Council has its own budget,
provided by the MFA.
<p>
The Minister for Development Cooperation is bound to respond to NAR recommendations. The written
reply of the Minister is sent to the Chairman of the Council and to Parliament. In preparing a
recommendation, the Council may organise hearings, sub-contract additional expertise, undertake studies,
and organise conferences. Recommendations are written by working groups of Council members and
finalised in a Plenary Meeting of the Council. A recommendation may be followed up by conferences,
discussions and other publications. In addition the Council prepares position papers and commentaries on
current issues in development cooperation. 
<p>
Since its start the Council has produced around 135 policy recommendations and reports on a wide range of
subjects. Currently it prepares recommendations on technology and development; on conflicts, security and
development; on an interministerial discussion paper about the 'joint implementation' (i.e. of emission
reduction measures) of the Framework Convention on Climate Change (1992). The Council is preparing
recommendations for the UN International World Conference on Women and Development (1995), for the
UN Social Summit (1995). Recent recommendations are: on the UN International Conference on Population
and Development (1994), on urban poverty combating, on development cooperation after the Treaty of
Maastricht, on norms and policy of the Dutch development cooperation. 
<p>
NAR recommendations, commentaries and other reports are summarised, translated in French and English,
and distributed to a wide public in the Netherlands -and abroad-, including Parliament. The NAR issues an
annual report and a publications list. 
<p>
Regular consultations between the administration and representatives of institutions and organisations in
Dutch society are an essential part of the Dutch political system. Advisory councils have a long tradition in
the Netherlands. There are presently 135 permanent and temporary advisory councils in the Netherlands.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has seven advisory councils (including the NAR), a.o. on human rights,
peace and security, and research. Recommendations by several Councils on the same subject area(s) are
coordinated. The presidium of the NAR annually discusses its work with members of both Chambers of
Parliament, with the Minister and with the Director-General of the DGIS. Several members of the NAR are
also involved in the work of other advisory councils. 
<p>
The Government has decided to reduce the number and the status of Dutch advisory councils, within its
efforts to renew and streamline administrative structures and procedures. Councils will have to focus on
advisory tasks, which will be separated from consultation processes. Within a new set-up the Parliament
may also directly request advice from these councils.
The annual budget for development cooperation is discussed extensively in both Chambers of Parliament.
The Minister has regularly discussions with the Standing Commissions of the Second Chamber of
Parliament. Till 1993 with the Standing Commission for Development Cooperation, thereafter with the
Standing Commission for Foreign Affairs. 
<p>
<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>
<p>
The Netherlands have an extensive network of NGOs, in nearly all sectors of society, that follow
government policies critically. The NGO-community for development cooperation plays an active role in
policy formulation, implementation and development education. The numerous development NGOs can
roughly be classified in 3 groups. Firstly the 4 Co-financing Organisations CEBEMO, HIVOS, ICCO and
NOVIB, the trade-unions FNV and CNV, the employers associations VNO and NCW (for management
assistance), the Organisation for Cooperation in Development Research and Education (NUFFIC, for
international education), the Foundation for Communication (the media), the Union of Dutch Municipalities,
the Hindu-Islamic HIMOS, and the expert-sending organisation PSO. These are all umbrella organisations
for large numbers of NGOs that are involved in development policy cooperation through long term
arrangements with the Government. Secondly, more than 300 local and national NGOs and action
committees involved in development cooperation on a project-by-project base and third, NGOs for
development education receiving support from the government funded NCO (National Committee for
Development Education).
<p>
When the budget for development cooperation is up for discussion in Parliament, representatives of the
NGOs are consulted by the Standing Committee on Development Cooperation. Since 1965 the DGIS has
built up an effective working relationship with the NGOs, which includes formulated formal procedures for
implementation, monitoring, consultation, evaluation and policy dialogue. Meetings between the Minister, or
representatives of the DGIS, with representatives from NGOs and boards are held monthly. Important
developments in developing countries are regularly discussed. 
<p>
Areas of concern for the Dutch NGOs in the current discussion with the Government are amongst others:
the consequences of the new development policy for the availability of funds for long term structural
development in the poorest countries, the claims other ministries might lay on the budget for non-
development purposes (in the Netherlands).
<p>
The 1991 OECD/EADI survey qualifies 48 institutes in the Netherlands as Development Research and
Training Institutes, some of which cooperate in the NUFFIC for training of foreign students. The Advisory
Council for Scientific Research in Development Problems (RAWOO), a sector council in 1990 installed by
the Minister for Development Cooperation, of Education and Science, and of Agriculture, Nature
Management and Fisheries, advises the Government on research policies for development cooperation. Its
main activity is to assess project proposals for research.

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Portuguese Development Cooperation</h3>

Portuguese development cooperation started in the late 1980s after Portugal joined the European
Community, from which Portugal still receives considerable assistance. In 1991 Portugal rejoined the DAC,
after it had left the organisation in 1974 when it requested to be considered a developing country.
Development cooperation, constituting a substantial part of Portuguese foreign relations, is based upon its
historic links, common language and economic interests in former colonies. However, since some time
efforts are undertaken to transform these policies, activities and their administration into a broader and more
structural model of development cooperation. There is a small but growing public support - and press
attention - for the latter type of development cooperation. The majority of the Portuguese population
perceives that it has an obligation towards the former colonies where previously about ten per cent of its
population lived, but also sees Portugal as a country not yet sufficiently developed itself.
<p>
Net official development assistance almost doubled since 1989 to US $ 302 million in 1992, which was 0.36
per cent of GNP, mainly through debt-rescheduling operations. Forecasts on the aid volume are difficult,
since relevant data are absent, but it will certainly be lower in the years after 1992. 16 per cent of ODA was
channelled through the EU in 1992, while multilateral aid, excluding EU contributions stood at 4 per cent.
For the coming years total multilateral ODA should stabilise on 25 per cent.
<p>
<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>
<p>
Portugal does not have a written charter for development cooperation, nor a central aid budget. Aid is not
clearly distinguished in the distinct budgets of the various ministries involved in development assistance. The
aid administration could be characterised as decentralised. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for
formulating development cooperation policy. The Minister of Foreign Affairs has delegated his authority to
a State Secretary for Development Cooperation. The government institutions responsible for development
assistance are presently being reorganised, in order to create a centralised aid administration. There used to
be a Directorate-General for Cooperation (DGC, since 1979), responsible for the bilateral socio-cultural,
scientific, and technical sectors of bilateral assistance. The Institute for Economic Cooperation (ICE, since
1976), an autonomous body responsible to both the MFA and the Ministry of Finance, is in charge of
financial, economic and entrepreneurial activities, including refinancing operations and most multilateral
contributions. In 1990 the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs together accounted for
almost 90 per cent of total ODA disbursements, with a rapidly growing share of the Ministry of Finance.
<p>
These DGC and ICE will merge into a new Agency, the Portuguese Institute for Cooperation (ICP), the
head of which will be the coordinator of all development cooperation activities, including those parts that
presently are under the responsibility of other Ministries.
<p>
Many ministries and institutions are involved in parts of the aid programme, dating back to the period when
they had direct ties with their respective counterparts in the former colonies. About ten per cent (1990) of
total ODA was shared by the Ministries of Planning and Administration, Youth and Mass Media,
Employment and Social Security, Education, Health, Defence and Internal Administration, and Public
Works, Transport and Communications. Depending on the area of work, their activities are sometimes
coordinated by the ICE or the DGC. In 1991 a Fund for Economic Cooperation (FCE) was established for
extending financial support to the PALOP's and other developing countries - falling within the general
development cooperation framework - and to promote Portuguese direct investments and trade related
projects. The Credits Insurance Company (COSEC) operates in all foreign countries for the insurance of
Portuguese investments.
<p>
It is not known whether a (central) policy planning unit for development cooperation does exist. In 1985 an
Interministerial Commission for Cooperation (CIC) was set up for the coordination of the aid programme. It
has only met three times since. The CIC includes representatives of DGC, ICE, and the other ministries
involved in aid. In the envisaged reorganisation of the administrational set-up, the CIC will be revitalised,
and start with regular meetings on sector-policies, and possibly merged with the CCC.
<p> 
Presently, in consultations with the developing countries concerned, two year 'framework programmes' for
cooperation are worked out. Common norms for handling of aid requests have been worked out by the DGC
and the ICE. Within the new set-up streamlining of procedures and the elaboration of planning, assessment
and evaluation mechanisms are foreseen. 
<p>
<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>
<p>
An Advisory Commission for Cooperation (CCC) was created in 1985. It includes representatives of the
implementing bodies and ministries, including the COSEC, the Investments, Trade and Tourism Agency
(ICEP), the Agency for Investments and Entrepreneurial Participation (IPE), as well as various trade and
investment associations. Parliamentarians and NGOs are not represented, only commercial interests. The
CCC has never met since its creation, although it was supposed to meet twice a year. Also the CCC might
be revitalised within the re-organisation of the aid administration and possibly be merged with the CIC. Both
the CIC and the CCC are chaired by the Secretary of State for Development Cooperation.
<p>
In addition, the Portuguese Association for Economic Development and Cooperation (ELO) has to be
mentioned. ELO is a non-profit organisation founded by the private sector, and funded by Portuguese
business communities that work in Lusophone countries. It acts as the Development Cooperation Agency of
the private sector. One of ELO's objectives for the coming years is to ensure the improvement of the
contacts between the Government, the NGOs and the private sector. It is very much in favour of the
establishment of a transparent consultative structure between these three actors. It has asked the Government
to take initiatives in this direction. ELO considers attention for the social, cultural and scientific aspects of
development cooperation essential for effective economic cooperation. It is of the opinion that available
knowledge and information on these aspects should be coordinated.
<p>
In Parliament the Commission on Foreign Affairs regularly receives reports of the DGC and the ICE.
However, there is no regular scrutiny by Parliament.
<p>
<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>
<p>
In Portugal 36 NGOs are involved in development cooperation. They only get a limited support from
government funds; their development work is for the greater part co-financed by the EU. Since 1985 there is
a representative Platform of NGOs with an Executive Committee. Recognising the importance of the role of
NGOs however, the Government has initiated discussions with the NGOs on the possibilities for establishing
a more structural and effective mutual relationship. NGOs demand more transparency of Government aid
policies and procedures and more information on Government aid activities. The Government also finances
directly NGO activities in developing countries.
<p>
According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey in Portugal 12 institutes are involved in development research
and training. It is not known to what extent they participate in government cooperation activities.

<p>
The legislative basis for Austria's aid programme is the Development Cooperation Act of 1974 and
subsequent Acts in 1977, 1983 and 1989. Development cooperation is not the responsibility of one minister,
but is spread over several ministries. Till 1989 development cooperation was the responsibility of the
Federal Chancellor and thereafter the competence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Since 1991 a State
Secretary for Integration and Development Cooperation, who heads the Department for Development
Cooperation in the Federal Chancellery (BKA) is responsible. The State Secretary is responsible for:
bilateral technical aid, co-financing programmes, humanitarian and emergency aid and parts of the
multilateral financial assistance. The financial efforts in these areas however, amount to less than 30 per
cent of the bilateral programme in 1992. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for multilateral aid.
The Ministry of Finance is responsible for financial aid (a.o. debt relief) and concessional official export
credits. The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for aid to refugees (in Austria), the Ministry of
Agriculture for food aid and the Ministry of Science and Research as well as the Ministry of Education are
both partly responsible for the scholarship programme. 
<p>
Since Austrian law does not allow the government to carry out its own programmes (principle of
subsidiarity), there is no governmental aid agency for the implementation of project. Implementation is
contracted out to private firms and NGOs or implemented by the federal L„nder and Municipalities.
<p>
The Secretary at the BKA is responsible for the overall coordination, programming and reporting on aid
policies, with the above mentioned extensive limitations. Policy planning is done by a Planning and
Programming which comes under the competence of the Department for Development Cooperation of the
BKA. During the coming re-organisation the number and expertise of the currently small number of staff in
the department will be enlarged and up-graded. 
<p>
To strengthen the coordination of the aid programme an Interministerial Committee for the Coordination of
Aid was established in 1992, including a dozen senior officials of the various ministries. The Committee is
chaired by the Director-General of the Department for Development Cooperation. The Committee can issue
non-binding recommendations only.

There are many small, mainly church related NGOs and a number of large ones. In 1991/1992 sixty per
cent of the bilateral aid was channelled through fifty NGOs. Four NGOs accounted for two-thirds of funds
made available. The NGOs continuously urge the government to improve the performance of its aid
programme and to raise the volume of aid. Discussions with the government concentrate on the question
whether 
NGOs can be discussion partners for the government in development cooperation policy matters or whether
they are subcontractors for implementation of projects only. In 1993 the Government and NGOs entered into
serious negotiations in order to establish a long term cooperation programme between government and
NGOs. An umbrella organisation of several development NGOs, the Working Association for Development
Cooperation (AGEZ), is acknowledged by the Government as a discussion partner on issues such as the
quality of Austrian aid and the consequences of Austria's EU membership. 
<p>
The NGOs can be roughly divided into four categories: firstly, organisations for the care of foreign students
in Austria (which originated in the late 1950s at the universities); experts and volunteer sending
organisations, organised in the Institute for International Cooperation and in the Austrian Development
Service; third, NGOs that implement projects in developing countries and fourth, NGOs for information and
development education.
<p>
According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey 11 institutes qualify as Development Research and Training
Institutes. Several contribute to the debate on development policy and implementation, such as the Vienna
Institute for Development Cooperation, the Austrian Foundation for Development Cooperation and the
Austrian Research Foundation for Development Cooperation. The latter institute publishes an annual survey
and analyses of Austria's development cooperation.

The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has been ratified by the European Union and its Member States, came into force in March 1994. As a Party to the Convention, the European Union is obliged to act to further the aims of the climate treaty through financial support, technology transfer and capacity strengthening for developing nations</I>. 
<p>
<H3>What is climate support?</H3>

There are two main ways in which nations can respond to the threat of climate change:
<ul>
<li>by reducing emissions to keep the scale of the climate warming as low as possible; and
<li>by preparing to adapt to climate change .
</ul><p>
The reason for this two-fold approach is that the emissions reductions required to avert climate change completely are considerable and some degree of environmental change is inevitable over coming decades.
<p>
The Climate Convention commits all nations to action on both of these fronts. In addition, the major industrialized nations are obliged to support the developing nation response. There are two reasons for this “climate support”. First, the industrialized world is responsible for the bulk of past emissions. Second, the future emissions contribution of the developing world may overwhelm that of the North, further compounding the climate threat. 
<p>
The EU has taken a lead in calling for stronger controls on greenhouse gas emissions, aligning itself with the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) in the climate negotiations. It has yet to take a similar lead as far as climate support is concerned. 
<p>
Specifically, the EU could assist the implementation of the Climate Convention in ACP countries through: 
<ul>
<li>the establishment of inventories of greenhouse gases and sinks;
<li>the preparation and implementation of adaptive climate strategies for countries vulnerable to climate change, particularly coastal regions and small island states;
<li>the promotion of clean and efficient energy sources;
<li>efforts to limit deforestation, the burning of forest and agriculture land, and other carbon emitting land use changes; and,
<li>the introduction of new agricultural practices to reduce methane emissions.
</ul>
In this briefing paper, examples are given of current climate support projects being undertaken by EU Member States and by others.

<H3>Action within the European Union</H3>

Member States are involved in a number of bilateral funding activities. Most are explicitly targeted at supporting developing nations in meeting their current formal obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Some initiatives go further in promoting measures that may be required in future years.
<ul>
<li>The German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), for example, has set up a programme of national studies for developing countries. Priority is being given to  energy-related national studies. Studies are underway in Tanzania and Zambia, amongst others, and are planned for Namibia, Zimbabwe and the Dominican Republic. See box 1 for further details.
<p>
<li>The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, through the Stockholm Environment Institute, is funding a study of adaptive responses to the impact of climate change in India as well as an information dissemination project. The Swedish Government, along with other national and international agencies, has funded a study of African policy options and responses to global climate change.
<p>
<li>The Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Development Cooperation is establishing country study programmes in Ghana, Senegal and elsewhere on greenhouse gas inventories, vulnerability assessment, and technology options, policy instruments and costs.
<p>
<li>Denmark has established the Danish Cooperation for Environment and Development (DANCED), based on additional finance, to tackle global environmental problems and implement the Earth Summit agreements. DANCED will concentrate on the themes of urban areas, forests, biological diversity and coastal zones (Southeast Asia and southern Africa). The Danish government has contributed to a climate study undertaken by the Tata Energy Research Institute and a national greenhouse gas abatement study in Zimbabwe.
<p>
<li>The French Global Environment Facility, again based on additional finance, intends to catalyze national aid efforts in the areas of climate change, biodiversity, ozone depletion and international waters. Projects will be integrated into larger sustainable development programmes and focus on capacity-strengthening and training in clean technologies. 
</ul><p>
<H3>Delivering a coordinated response</H3>

Concern has been voiced during the climate negotiations that bilateral initiatives may undercut the aims of the Climate Convention if some degree of coordination, or at least mutual awareness of activities, is not achieved.  In line with the development cooperation provisions of the Treaty on European Union, the EU has a special responsibility to ensure that Community actions and those of the Member States are well-coordinated and complement each other.

Exploring joint implementation

Alongside traditional development assistance projects, industrialized nations are also exploring the potential of “joint implementation” (see Briefing Paper No. 6). Measures to control greenhouse gas emissions and to promote the removal of gases through sink enhancement (such as tree-planting) vary in cost from nation to nation. Cooperation between nations can improve cost-effectiveness as one nation subsidizes measures taken in another, taking credit for the emissions reductions that ensue.

A lively debate has surrounded the issue of joint implementation over the past few years and there has been much discussion concerning criteria for such schemes which will ensure that these projects are effective and do not disadvantage poorer countries. Under the Climate Convention, a pilot phase of projects, or activities, “implemented jointly” is taking place. This particular wording has been adopted to underline the fact that there is no agreement as yet regarding criteria for joint implementation schemes.

<table border=1 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><center><h4>Box 1. Support for the Implementation of the Climate Convention</h4></center>The German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), on behalf of the Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, is currently supporting developing countries in preparing the country studies called for by the Climate Convention.   The programme of activities concentrates on establishing emission balances and on the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide mitigation. The regional focus is on Southern Africa and Asia.<p>In Zambia, GTZ has supported an inventory study and survey of mitigation options and political strategies for capacity building, executed by the Ministry of Water and Energy Development with support from the Southern Centre for Energy and Environment in Zimbabwe. The project has covered the estimation of sources and sinks and future emissions trends, the identification of cost-effective options for avoiding emissions and the development of recommendations for national abatement targets.<p>In Tanzania, the Center for Environment, Energy, Sciences and Technology in Dar es Salaam has been undertaking a greenhouse gas mitigation study on behalf of the Ministry of Tourism, Natural Resources and Environment. The study has considered not only technological options for reducing emissions, including cost-effectiveness, but also social, cultural and political aspects of the implementation of these options and the relevance for national energy policy.	<p>The Tanzanian project is part of the first phase of a longer term programme of support for prompt start measures to implement the Climate Convention. During the second phase, from late 1996, the aim is to encourage activities that go beyond the formal reporting requirements of the Climate Convention.  During this latter phase, application-oriented investigations of the technological and political potential to limit emissions will be funded and relevant strategies and policy recommendations will be developed and integrated into sectoral policy and energy planning. Training for local personnel, capacity-building for institutions and networking for major actors will be critical components of this work.<p>	Projects which have positive benefits at the micro- and macro-economic levels-by saving energy or improving energy efficiency-and reduce greenhouse gas emissions will be prioritized.<p>  For example, a study of the use of renewable energies for power supply in Namibia is at the planning stage. The project will consider potential sites for renewable energy plant, design requirements for solar thermal and wind generators, evaluate the economics of selected generating plant and assess environmental benefits.<p>	The Ministry of Transport and Energy in Zimbabwe is supporting plans for a study of the potential for regional power pooling in Southern Africa. The survey will consider the emissions savings that might result from power pooling, technical feasibility, whether or not regional authorities would be prepared to support such an initiative, and the technical, political and administrative pre-requisites if such a scheme is to be successful.<p>	For further information on the GTZ programme, contact: Holger Liptow, Energy Division, GTZ, Postfach 5180, 65726 Eschborn, Germany.

<p>
The pilot phase covers activities implemented jointly among Annex I Parties (the richer, industrialized nations) and, on a voluntary basis, between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. Pilot phase activities should:
<ul>
<li>be compatible with and supportive of national environment and development priorities and strategies;
<li>contribute to cost-effectiveness in achieving global benefits;
<li>be conducted in a comprehensive manner covering all relevant sources, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases; and 
<li>bring about real, measurable and long-term environmental benefits related to the mitigation of climate change that would not have occurred in the absence of such activities.
</ul><p>
The financing of these activities should be additional to existing financial obligations and overseas development assistance flows. For the time being, Parties will not be able to claim credit against their own national emissions reduction targets for these projects.
<p>
As of autumn 1995, 17 such projects had been endorsed by the governments of the countries involved. A number of Member States are setting up joint implementation projects with developing countries and have established schemes in partnership with nations in Eastern Europe and the Russian Federation. For example, the Government of The Netherlands has committed NLG12 million annually over the period 1997-99 for (co-)financing pilot projects in developing nations and the same amount for projects in Central and Eastern Europe. The United States is investing in developing nations in Central and South America. The private sector plays an important role in many of these projects, making available additional investment.
<p>
Most existing projects are in the energy field - solar electrification, wind energy, energy saving, compressed natural gas, coal-to-gas conversion - as it is in this area that the most significant gains can be made in reducing growth in greenhouse gas emissions. 
<p>
In Costa Rica, for instance, the construction of 55 windmills (20 MW) began in spring 1995. The Plantas Eolicas project represents the first commercial-scale wind power generation in Central America and is a US$30 million joint initiative between the Costa Rican national utility company, Instituto Costaricense de Electricidad, and three private American firms (with the endorsement of the US Government). It has been estimated that the project will result in the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 100,000 tons a year if fossil fuel-generated power is displaced by the wind power that the project produces. The advantages for Costa Rica are assistance with compliance with the Climate Convention, a reliable source of electricity and diversification of supply, the transfer of modern technology, job creation, and risk reduction in investment.
<p>
At present, there are no active joint implementation projects in the regions of Africa or the Pacific. Continued lack of involvement will hinder expansion of clean technology in these regions.

<H3>Progress with the Global Environment Facility</H3>

The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is to operate the financial mechanism of the Climate Convention for a further four years. It has been specified, under the Climate Convention, that projects funded by the GEF should be cost-effective, supportive of national development priorities and focused, at least at first, on enabling activities that would help developing countries implement the Convention.
<p>
As of December 1995, the GEF Work Programme covered funding to a total of US$328 million in the focal area of climate change. Most projects are directed towards supporting developing country responses to the Climate Convention and, to date, tend towards emissions control issues rather than adaptive strategies. There is a strong capacity-building element.
<p>
To cite one example, the Maldives has received US$1 million through the GEF to undertake a greenhouse gas inventory and adaptation assessment project. The objective of the project is to increase the capacity of this small island state in the areas of emissions control and vulnerability assessment. The project involves diffusion of the approach and findings to other small island developing nations so that they can share in the capacity-building exercise.
<p>
In Africa, the Sudan is involved in a US$0.3 million project to strengthen its capacity to respond to the requirements of the Climate Convention. It is also the focus of a US$1.5 million study of carbon sequestration and biodiversity protection through community-based rangeland rehabilitation.
<p>
US$2.5 million has been allocated by the GEF to a household energy project in Mali and US$2 million to a decentralized wind electric power project in Mauritania. Zimbabwe is undertaking a US$7 million photovoltaic project for household and community use.

<H3>The way forward for the European Union</H3>

Alongside the more vulnerable developing nations, the EU has taken the lead in calling for stronger emissions controls under the Climate Convention. Building on this political momentum, it should develop a clear policy stance linking climate and development cooperation. This could build on the growing body of experience with climate support gained through bilateral programmes, the Global Environment Facility and pilot joint implementation projects.
<p>
Three areas emerge as priorities for the future:
<ul>
<li>working towards a coordinated response within the European Union, learning from existing bilateral and international efforts and drawing on the experience of Member States;
<li>engaging in a dialogue with the ACP States to discover their needs and priorities;
<li>integrating climate concerns into mainstream development assistance programming, particularly in the areas of energy, agriculture, forests, industry, transport and coastal zone management.

<P>
<I>The Center for Development Research (CDR) has recently committed
itself to expanding its research on the impact of development
assistance, in part as a means to improve and expand cooperation
with the Danish International Development Agency, Danida. This
paper is intended to facilitate discussion among CDR researchers
and Danida staff about how to structure their collaboration in
developing and designing aid impact research. In doing so, the
paper draws upon state-of-the-art methodologies which professional
evaluators use to involve stakeholders in evaluations of their
projects and programs (Guba and Lincoln 1989, Patton 1986). A
hypothetical example illustrates how CDR researchers could adapt
these methodologies to develop a research agenda, and to develop
specific issues from that agenda into research proposals, in collaboration
with Danida staff. The key methods in this are semi-structured
interviewing and the constant comparative method of analysis.</I>
<P>
<I>The hypothetical case can facilitate discussing among CDR and
Danida staff by giving them a common starting point. By pointing
out what they do and do not like or find feasible in the case,
staff from the two organizations can generate ideas for a mutually
acceptable methodology for collaboration. The paper's conclusions
start this discussion by making explicit two prerequisites for
the methodology described: that CDR researchers will invest considerably
more time in the very preliminary phase of research, i.e., topic
selection; and that CDR's present procedures for approving Research
Council (RUF)-destined research proposals are modified.</I>
<P>
<a name=int></a><H3>1. Introduction</H3>
<P>
The Center for Development Research (CDR) has committed itself
to sending to its governing Board in mid-1996 a plan for expanding
CDR research on the impact of development assistance.  The impetus
to expand research in this area stems in part from an emerging
consensus that Danida, the wing of the Danish Foreign Ministry
which administers Danish development assistance, and CDR, a research
institute affiliated with the Ministry, must collaborate more
and better.  Most observers and participants agree that the two
organizations have not cooperated sufficiently in the past.  Now,
however, a growing number of the people concerned believe that
collaboration should increase and improve.  This was the context
in which the Board urged the CDR to develop a research profile
on aid impact, and CDR pledged to do so.  Thus, aid impact research
at CDR will have the manifest function of contributing to knowledge
about how donor interventions affect the development process,
and the not-quite-latent function of developing a model for collaboration
between CDR and Danida.
<P>
The primary purpose of this paper is to facilitate a discussion
among CDR researchers and Danida staff about how to structure
their collaboration in developing and designing research on aid
impact.  In doing this, the paper draws upon state-of-the-art
methodologies which professional evaluators use to involve stakeholders
in focusing and designing the evaluations of projects and programs.
 Section 3 below summarizes the salient points of two such methodologies:
fourth generation evaluation, as presented by Guba and Lincoln
(1989), and utilization-focused evaluation, as presented by Patton
(1986).  Section 4 presents a hypothetical case of CDR researchers
using elements of these methodologies to collaborate with Danida
in designing research on the impact of Danida rural drinking water
projects.  The concluding section suggests how CDR and Danida
staff can use the case study and other information provided in
the paper to discuss collaboration in regard to aid impact research.
<P>
First, though, the next section reviews the various and sometimes
conflicting meanings or connotations of the three terms which
are key to the discussion: research, collaboration, and aid impact.
 In this paper, each term will have a specific definition or connotation,
as explained in Section 2.  However, CDR and Danida staff could
profitably launch the general discussion of their collaboration
through specific discussions of how they wish to use each term.
 In this respect, as in all others, the paper represents an effort
to raise and structure issues for discussion between the two parties,
and not to give answers.

<a name=res></a><B>2.1 Research</b>
<P>
Patton, a professional evaluator who will be extensively quoted
later in the paper, conceptualizes research as a continuum along
the dimension of generalizability (Patton 1990, 145-162).  <I>&quot;The
continuum ranges from very basic, long-term research aimed at
theory development and knowledge for its own sake to highly action-oriented
research aimed at solving immediate problems in as short a time
as possible&quot;</I> (Ibid, 158).  In other words, &quot;generalizability&quot;
basically refers to the theoretical aspirations of a particular
piece of research.  One can best explain this through describing
in terms of this concept several points (or intervals) on the
continuum, e.g., basic research and applied research at one end;
formative evaluation and summative evaluation somewhere toward
the middle; and participatory research at the other end.  However,
the reader should bear in mind from the outset that this continuum
is analogous to a spectrum, not a line.  On a line, each point
is discrete and uniquely definable.  In a spectrum, some points
are clearly occupied by one color or another, but at the points
where one color merges into the next, one cannot definitely identify
the color.  Similarly, whether to label a particular piece of
research as &quot;basic&quot; versus &quot;applied,&quot; or &quot;applied&quot;
versus &quot;evaluative,&quot; and so forth may depend largely
on the eye of the beholder.
<P>
In basic research, the researcher aims to develop a theory with
explanatory power in a variety of contexts quite removed from
the original research situation.  The research through its theoretical
contribution, in other words, will lead to very broad generalizations.
 Samuel Popkin (1979), for instance, studies Vietnamese peasants
in order to develop a theory of rational action applicable to
human behavior regardless of setting.  For instance, rational
choice theory is currently being used to predict how U.S. parents
would make schooling decisions if provided with educational vouchers.
<P>
In applied research, the researcher aims to develop theory which
permits generalization across contexts which share certain characteristics
with the original research setting.  Most development research
is therefore applied research, in that it produces generalizations
applicable only in development contexts, and often only in some
sub-set of these.  Hyden (1983), for instance, offers some generalizations
about African subsistence peasants, based on his studies in Tanzania.
 His theory of the economy of affection, however, does not even
apply to Tanzanian farmers.
<P>
Patton places summative and formative evaluations in the middle
of the spectrum.  Formative evaluations make generalizations only
about the specific program, project, policy, etc. being evaluated
(Patton 1990, 156).   A formative evaluation, for instance, might
investigate whether a child health project succeeded in reducing
diarrheal rates and how the various component activities contributed
to this.  Summative evaluations lie closer to applied research
because they investigate whether a program, policy, etc. has been
effective in a specific context <I>and</I> under what conditions
it is likely to be effective elsewhere (Ibid, 155).  For example,
a summative evaluation might make generalizations about the relative
effectiveness of breast-feeding, oral rehydration solutions, and
vaccinations in reducing children's diarrhea.
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum from basic research lies participatory
research in which the objective, as Robert Chambers describes
is, <I>&quot;is less to gather data, and more to start a process&quot;</I>
(Chambers 1994b, 1266).  The researcher aims to mobilize and empower
a given group of people through helping them to gather, analyze,
and use information.  If a participatory researcher worked in
a Vietnamese or Tanzanian village, the villagers in that particular
village in the end should have taken steps to better their lives
based on knowledge which they have gained with the help of the
researcher.  The information is not &quot;generalized&quot; beyond
the use to which those villagers put it in that particular time
period.
<P>
Patton's conceptualization of research is reminiscent of the distinction
which Glaser and Strauss (1967, 32-35) draw between substantive
and formal theories.  Substantive theory provides a framework
of inquiry within a substantive area such as race relations, delinquency,
or education.  Formal theory deals with a higher level of abstraction,
e.g., stigma, deviant behavior, or socialization.  <I>&quot;Substantive
and formal theories,&quot;</I> Glaser and Strauss write, <I>&quot;exist
on distinguishable levels of generality, which differ only in
terms of degree&quot;</I> (Ibid, 33).  In both Patton's work,
and that of Glaser and Strauss, the operative concept is <I>generalizability</I>,
which can vary in degree.
<P>
One advantage of Patton's conceptualization lies precisely in
linking the concepts of research and theoretical generalizability,
both of which are constitutive of social (and natural) science.
 This provides a certain face validity to his conceptualization.
 Another advantage is that Patton's approach elegantly encompasses
very different types of research.  The qualitative research advocated
by Glaser and Strauss, and the participatory research which Chambers
advocates, can both be accommodated within &quot;research&quot;
defined as a continuum along the dimension of generalizability.
 The third advantage to Patton's formulation is that it does not
include extraneous characteristics which would transform the continuum
into a hierarchy.  Different points along the continuum correspond
to different ways of conceptualizing problems, designing data
collection, disseminating findings, and so forth.  Nothing in
this, however, suggests that one type of research is better than
another.
<P>
It is this third advantage which above all justifies adopting
in this paper Patton's conceptualization of research.  &quot;Research&quot;
often becomes an emotionally laden and politically charged symbol
in battles for status, funds, and so forth.  Patton explains how
these battles are fought at a symbolic level, as follows:
<P>
<I> &quot;...researchers engaged in research at various points
along the continuum have very strong opinions and feelings about
researchers at other points along the continuum.  Research can
be a highly political activity that generates opposing opinions
and strong emotions.  Basic and applied researchers, for example,
would often dispute even calling formative and action research
by the name </I>research<I>.  The standards that basic researchers
apply to what they would consider &quot;good&quot; research excludes
(sic) even some applied research because it may not manifest the
conceptual clarity and theoretical rigor in real-world situations
that basic researchers value.  Formative and action researchers,
on the other hand, may attack basic research for being esoteric
and irrelevant&quot;</I> (Patton 1990, 158).
<P>
Patton implies that emotions can run even higher in situations
where persons from academic and professional (&quot;real-world&quot;)
milieux mix:
<P>
<I> &quot;On the whole, within universities and among scholars,
the status hierarchy in science attributes the highest status
to basic research, secondary status to applied research, little
status to summative evaluation research, and virtually no status
to formative and action research.  The status hierarchy is reversed
in real-world settings, where people with problems attribute the
greatest significance to action and formative research that can
help them to solve their problems in a timely way and attach the
least importance to basic research, which they consider remote
and largely irrelevant to what they are doing on a day-to-day
basis&quot;  (Ibid, 158-59).</I>
<P>
This clash between academic and professional values manifests
itself in the contrasting views of CDR versus Danida staff in
regard to research.  CDR staff often articulate a view of research
which makes it more or less synonymous with basic research.  Following
Patton, one can explain this tendency in terms of the academic
norms, values, and attitudes which pervade the organizational
culture at CDR.  A number of the permanent CDR staff have an exclusively
academic background (i.e., employed in universities or research
institutes), while many of the non-permanent staff are students,
recent graduates, or university lecturers.  Their training and
experience, in other words, leads them to value theoretical development
for its own sake.  Danida staff, on the other hand, have largely
professional career patterns (i.e., employed by government or
private sector), although a number of them have graduate degrees.
 They view CDR research as Patton predicts, describing it with
comments such as  <I>&quot;The research undertaken by the Centre
is often not relevant for Danida, nor is it up to date,&quot;</I>
and <I>&quot;The Centre is slow in reacting to Danida's pressing
needs and immediate demands&quot;</I> (Danida 1996, 64-65).  Good
research, for Danida staff, provides answers to the questions
which they confront in their work.
<P>
Patton's remarks about the politics of what will be labelled &quot;research&quot;
are also pertinent to CDR's situation.  In this case, it involves
bureaucratic politics related to the issue of who will set the
work program for CDR researchers.  Due to this, &quot;research&quot;
has become almost inextricably entwined with a notion resembling
academic freedom.  A brief description of the organizational relationship
between CDR and Danida is necessary in order to explain this connotation
of &quot;research.&quot;
<P>
CDR was originally incorporated under a government provision for
ministries, in this case the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to establish
research institutes in their respective fields so as to <I>&quot;provide
the scientific basis for the decisions made by politicians and
authorities&quot;</I> (SEDIRK 1995).  However, for various historical
reasons, CDR has traditionally enjoyed a high degree of autonomy
from the Ministry, including Danida to which CDR is specifically
&quot;attached.&quot;  One feature of this autonomy has been that
the permanent staff have largely set their own research agendas.
 These research activities are acknowledged by all parties to
be the primary function of CDR staff.  A secondary, relatively
minor, activity of CDR staff has been to act as consultants to
Danida, i.e., to carry out short tasks usually related to the
project cycle.  In other words, a CDR researcher might be a member
of an appraisal, review, or evaluation mission.  CDR staff have
also done consultancies, such as literature reviews, which make
more direct use of the particular skills of researchers.  In all
consultancies, though, Danida staff set the work agenda through
a Terms of Reference which specify the tasks to be completed.
 Danida staff ultimately decide whether the consultants have adequately
fulfilled the Terms of Reference.  
<P>
In this environment, &quot;research&quot; (often used in opposition
to &quot;consultancy&quot;) has become a code word for the prerogative
of CDR staff to use their own judgement in setting their work
programs, and their own standards for evaluating the quality and
completeness of the final product.  A <I>sous-entendu</I> in this
claim for independence is that CDR should play a watch-dog role,
commenting publicly and critically on Danish foreign policy and
development assistance as it affects the Third World.
<P>
For the sake of conceptual precision, this paper will not confound
these organizational issues with the concept of research.  Instead,
they will be considered below in the discussing the requisites
and prerequisites for a viable and productive collaboration between
Danida and CDR staff.  
<P>
<a name=col></a><B>2.2 Collaboration</b>
<P>
This sub-section does not discuss the definition of &quot;collaboration,&quot;
as the concept <I>per se</I> is not ambiguous or otherwise problematic.
 Instead, the sub-section reviews various assumptions about collaboration
between CDR and Danida staff, in order to separate out those assumptions
which are unrealistic or prejudicial, and identify the conditions
for a viable and mutually beneficial collaboration.
<P>
The team which recently evaluated CDR briefly outlined a collaborative
process which, on closer examination, rests on several dubious
assumptions.  The evaluation team recommended,
<P>
<I> &quot;...that the director and relevant research areas [from
CDR] meet with S.1 and the Evaluation and Research department
[from Danida] on a regular basis, to discuss the Centre's involvement
in...research projects, which Danida is interested in having the
Centre undertake.&quot;</I>  (Danida 1996, 68).
<P>
This recommendation rests on three assumptions which will be critiqued
below: CDR can supply researchers and funds to implement research
projects which have been designed without regard to these two
considerations; the Evaluation and Research Department and S.1
(bilateral assistance policy and planning division) can represent
the intended Danida users of the research findings; and these
two offices have a capacity and interest to develop useful research
projects.  
<P>
In regard to the first assumption, it requires a real stretch
of the imagination to envision CDR assigning a researcher to a
presumably long term research project developed by Danida.  At
best, one can imagine CDR would be able to assign a researcher
for a short period, as it has done for Danida consultancies. 
In general, it is more realistic to assume either that none of
CDR's researchers would be suitably qualified for the particular
project, or that the qualified researchers would have on-going
research commitments which preclude more than a token amount of
time to a Danida assignment.  In short, under its present structure,
CDR does not have a large pool of researchers whose current commitments
can be shifted around in order to meet the demands of a client.
<P>
In addition, having Danida staff design the research projects
and send them to CDR for implementation would violate the norms
of the organizational culture at CDR, as explained above.  Unlike
for consultancies, CDR researchers have always retained the primary
responsibility for conceptualization and design of research. 
Unless those norms change, which is difficult to imagine, CDR
staff will not react very positively to research being formulated
and carried out along the same lines as consultancies.
<P>
In regard to the second assumption, the most likely users within
Danida of research findings do not work in the two offices mentioned
above, although staff there could in some circumstances use research
findings in their own work.  The Evaluation and Research Department
has the responsibility to see that evaluations and research within
Danida are carried out, but would generally not make direct use
of the information gathered.  As a policy-making body, S.1 in
principle would use the output from certain research projects.
 However, there are seven other divisions (S.2-S.8) at the same
organizational level as S.1, and these offices have a more immediate
role in policy-making because they have more direct responsibility
for the different segments of the Danish assistance program. 
Also, a good deal of decision-making power over the programs has
been decentralized to the Danish embassies.  Finally, the sectoral
specialists who advise on and oversee the technical quality of
program planning and implementation work in yet another office,
TSA (roughly translatable as Technical Advisory Services).  These
professionals would in fact be among the most likely consumers
of research findings.  
<P>
The exact configuration of intended primary users would depend
on the particular project.  For instance, for an impact evaluation
of a rural drinking water project (the example used below for
the case), it might be the TSA staff who handle water projects,
and representatives from the embassies and S divisions covering
countries in which drinking water has been selected as a sector
for future Danish assistance.  Representatives from the Evaluation
and Research Department and S.1 could hardly be expected to articulate
the information needs of this group.
<P>
The third assumption underestimates the time, work, and expertise
needed to identify useful research questions.  At minimum, developing
a particular piece of research on program or project impact will
require a good familiarity with the literature and experience
in the particular area, and a good sense of who will use the research
and toward what ends.  It does not seem reasonable to expect the
generalist staff in these two offices to take on this additional
task, and execute it with the care and attention required.
<P>
A more productive way to think about the collaborative process
would be to make the three opposite assumptions:  the individual
researcher who will carry out the research will play a key facilitating
role in developing the research topic or agenda; this researcher
will identify and work on developing the research design with
the Danida staff who have a felt need for the research findings;
the process of developing a research topic or agenda requires
time, a methodology (i.e., rules and procedures for its conduct),
and methods for its successful implementation.
<P>
Section 3 will review how evaluators carry out a collaborative
process based on similar assumptions in defining evaluation questions
and designing an evaluation methodology in conjunction with those
whose program or project is being evaluated.  The hypothetical
case in Section 4 provides a springboard for Danida and CDR staff
to discuss whether these state-of-the-art evaluation methodologies
have any relevance for their situation.
<P>
In addition to the above three requisites, successful collaboration
requires a certain attitude toward each other on the part of the
CDR and Danida staff involved.  This is analogous to the prerequisite
attitude which a participatory researcher must have toward the
men and women with whom he or she will collaborate.  In this situation,
a researcher who did not have a great deal of respect for the
local knowledge and experience of these people would not succeed,
despite applying state-of-the-art participatory methodologies
and methods.  For instance, a researcher who said things such
as, <I>&quot;We can't let these people tell us what to research;
that's our job,&quot; </I>or <I>&quot;If these people want us
to do research which benefits them, then they're going to have
to work out detailed research questions and come to us&quot;</I>
would make a poor candidate for participatory research.  A CDR
researcher who said similar things, replacing &quot;local people&quot;
with &quot;Danida,&quot; would best stick to non-collaborative
research.  Likewise, Danida staff who do not believe that research
can answer any questions of value to them in their work should
not involve themselves in collaborative efforts.
<P>
<a name=imp></a><B>2.3 Impact of Development Assistance</B>
<P>
The textbook definition of impact evaluation is as follows:
<P>
<I> &quot;An impact evaluation gauges the extent to which a program
causes change in the desired direction.  It implies that there
is a set of pre-specified, operationally defined goals and criteria
of success; a program that has impact is one that achieves some
movement or change toward the desired objectives&quot;</I> (Rossi,
Freeman, and Wright 1979, 41).
<P>
The appropriate methodology for isolating change which is due
to the program, and measuring the size of that change, is an experimental
or quasi-experimental research design (Ibid, 42; Valadez and Bamberger
1994, 228).
<P>
During the 1970s and early 1980s, donors increasingly adopted
this view of impact and its evaluation, due to the spread of logical
framework analysis (Binnendijk 1989, 208; Cracknell 1988, 80).
 Using a logical framework approach requires an intervention's
designers to specify its activities, outputs, and objectives,
and then give objectively verifiable indicators for each, as well
as state how or from where data on these indicators will be obtained.
 Thus, incorporated into the design of an intervention, are plans
for a evaluation of its impact, fully in line with the textbook
definition of the term.  Furthermore, donors and evaluators worked
on the assumption that the impact of interventions should be tested
using experimental and quasi-experimental research designs (Binnendijk
1989, 209).  
<P>
However, the experience with using this concept and methodology
for studying development assistance impact eventually led donors
to adopt a much broader notion of impact and much greater methodological
diversity.  Two sets of problems with evaluations based on the
logical framework caused this shift. 
<P>
The first set of problems stemmed from the inevitable focus of
the evaluations on the objectives as stated in the logical framework
(Binnendijk 1989, 210, 214).  Over time, these objectives might
have changed or become irrelevant, or never have been realistic
and appropriate in the first place.  Meanwhile, other issues,
such as sustainability, might define more relevant information
needs.  The focus on stated objectives also meant that data on
unintended impacts might not be collected.  In any case, the logical
framework provided little guidance as to what type of unintended
impact to search for, and where and how to do so.  
<P>
The second set of problems related to largely to the practical
problems of carrying out quasi-experimental research on development
projects (Ibid, 210-14).  Many projects failed simply to collect
and analyze the specified data, no small task considering that
quasi-experimental research typically requires extensive data
collection from large random samples of both beneficiaries and
control groups before, during, and after implementation, and relatively
sophisticated statistical analysis once the data has been computerized.
 Second, even when projects did manage to collect and analyze
the data, this process often delivered findings long after they
were needed, or was so poorly executed that the findings were
unreliable.  
<P>
There were also conceptual problems in using quasi-experimental
research.  In principal, policy-makers can generalize from the
findings of quasi-experimental research to select the most effective
approach to achieving a given end.  In reality, an intervention
which had proven effective in one area would not necessarily be
successful in another, because so many variables affecting impact
would differ from one context to the next.  The costs and time
required to do quasi-experimental research are not justified,
if the findings are not generalizable.
<P>
To address the first set of problems, donors broadened the focus
and concept of impact evaluation in a number of ways.  For instance,
impact evaluations looked now at unintended impacts, and impacts
related to objectives which had not been part of the original
logical framework, e.g., financial and institutional sustainability,
environmental protection, private sector development, women's
empowerment, cost-effectiveness.  In other words, an impact evaluation
no longer necessarily implied the textbook definition of looking
at progress toward stated objectives.  In fact, the original objectives
could be evaluated, rather than simply accepted as the standard
against which to judge progress.  Impact evaluations might be
carried out during implementation, instead of only ex-post.  Behind
these innovations lay the recognition that 
<P>
<I> &quot;an evaluation's focus should not be dictated in the
basis of some research design or framework developed by 'outsiders,'
but should instead be based upon a dialogue with the intended
management users regarding their actual evaluation questions and
information needs&quot;</I>  (Binnendijk 1989, 214).
<P>
In response to the second set of problems, donors began to use
quasi-experimental research far more selectively (Valadez and
Bamberger 1994, 258-88; Binnendijk 1989, 216).  Most evaluations,
including impact evaluations, were instead based on methods which
delivered information on a wide variety of issues quickly, simply,
and inexpensively.  Some of these methods, for example mini surveys,
were abbreviated versions of methods used in quantitative research.
 Other methods, such as focus group discussions and other types
of semi-structured interviews, had previously been used to complement
quantitative research.  Information from beneficiaries was also
solicited through a range of innovative and creative techniques
such as ranking, case studies, various approaches to matrix-building,
etc.  New methods to structure observation, for instance transect
walks, were introduced.  
<P>
A number of these methods would be fitted together in a methodology
which could be completed in a matter of weeks or a few months,
in contrast to the years required for quasi-experimental research.
 For example, the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) commissioned quasi-experimental research to investigate
the health impact of a USAID-funded water project in Malawi (Young
and Briscoe 1986).  The field work required eight months, and
the analysis and report writing another seven months.  By contrast,
USAID also commissioned a series of impact evaluations on water
projects, in which teams spent between two and six weeks on data
collection, and the published reports appeared within about four
to six months.  These rapid methodologies saved money as well
as time.  A USAID evaluator estimated that <I>&quot;a probability
sample survey conducted by a U.S.-based firm is likely to cost
$100,000 to $200,000, whereas four to six studies using rapid,
low-cost methods can be completed for this amount&quot;</I> (Kumar
1987b, 4).
<P>
In short, donors have not rejected the textbook definition of
impact, but they have generally subsumed it within a much, much
broader conceptualization.  USAID and OECD use the following definition
of impact:
<P>
<I> &quot;A term indicating whether the project or program has
had an effect on its surroundings in terms of technical, economic,
sociocultural, institutional, and environmental factors&quot;</I>
(Kumar 1989c, vii).
<P>
Another USAID report waxes even more eloquently on the need to
go beyond the traditional definition:
<P>
<I> &quot;The purpose of impact evaluations then is to explore
the terrain, to review what has happened since an intervention
or policy was tried, to collect impressions about the extent to
which the intervention made a difference, to suggest what problems
remain, and to speculate about alternative designs for similar
programs or projects.  Their function, in other words, is to contribute
to more informed decisions, rather than come to a definitive conclusion
that project X led to result Y, and that Y would not have occurred
in the absence of the project&quot;</I> (White 1986, 4).
<P>
<a name=two></a><H3>3. Two Methodologies for Stakeholder Participation</H3>
<P>
The vast academic literature on evaluation methodology has not
contributed much to the evaluation of development assistance,
because this writing comes out of the very different experience
of evaluating domestic social programs, particularly in the United
States.  The report which the Organization of Economic Cooperation
and Development commissioned from two eminent professional evaluators,
Freeman and Rossi, suffered from the same drawback of attempting
to transfer their skill and experience with American domestic
programs to the totally different context of development assistance
(Cracknell 1988, 76).
<P>
However, the two methodologies which will be described below have
been used for evaluating development projects, and therefore do
not suffer from the same limitations as other evaluation methodologies
described in the academic literature.  For that reason, those
generally interested in studying the impact of development assistance
will no doubt find it profitable to learn more about fourth generation
and utilization-focused methodologies.  Readers should remember,
however, the specific reason for reviewing the two methodologies
here: elements of them can be adapted to the process which precedes
actual research on aid impact, namely to the collaborative development
of research topics and projects in this area.
<P>
<a name=fou></a><B>3.1 Fourth Generation Evaluation</B>
<P>
The label &quot;fourth generation&quot; reflects the contrast
which the authors wish to make with previous generations of evaluations,
in which the evaluator's tasks were respectively to measure, to
describe, and to make professional judgements about a program
under evaluation (Guba and Lincoln 1989, 21-49).  Instead, the
role for a fourth generation evaluator is to help stakeholders
outline the issues which need to be resolved in a program, and
to build commitment among stakeholders toward taking the necessary
action. 
<P>
A fourth generation methodology therefore consists largely of
procedures and methods for interacting with stakeholders to help
them articulate their views on the strengths, weaknesses, and
outstanding issues in a program.  This description of the program,
as perceived by the stakeholders, provides the input for drawing
up an &quot;agenda for negotiation,&quot; i.e., the basis for
discussion among the stakeholders about the program's future.
<P>
In carrying out a fourth generation evaluation, the evaluator
uses qualitative methods similar to those which an anthropologist,
sociologist, or other social scientist might use in a study which
aims to portray how the world looks from the perspective of a
particular group of people.  For instance, an anthropologist would
employ qualitative methods in studying the parallels between mythical
thought and how human communities structure their relations with
outsiders (Silverman 1985, 15).  A sociologist might do a qualitative
study of organizations in order to explain how managers perceive
and select job applicants (Silverman and Jones 1975; Silverman
1985, 14).  Two sociologists developed a new method of qualitative
analysis in the course of research on how nurses perceive, and
therefore relate to, dying patients (Glaser and Strauss 1965,
1967).  The fourth generation evaluator employs this same method,
called the constant comparative method, to construct a description
of how various groups of stakeholders view the program and the
issues facing it.
<P>
The constant comparative method consists of developing empirically
grounded concepts, and eventually theory, through the constant
coding and recoding of qualitative data as it is collected (Glaser
and Strauss 1967, Strauss 1987, Strauss and Corbin 1990, Lincoln
and Guba 1985).  In other words, on a daily basis the researcher
codes interview and observation notes; and each time an incident
is coded under a category, it is compared with previous incidents
coded in the same category.  As Glaser and Strauss (1967, 106)
explain,
<P>
  <I>&quot;This constant comparison of the incidents very soon
starts to generate the theoretical properties of the category.
 The analyst starts thinking in terms of the full range of types
or continua of the category, its dimensions, the conditions under
which it is pronounced or minimized, its major consequences, its
relation to other categories, and its other properties.&quot;</I>

<P>
The qualitative researcher thus constantly reformulates the codes.
 To aid this process, the researcher writes memos to explain the
thinking which lies behind the recoding.
<P>
But whereas the researcher uses this method to develop concepts
and eventually theory, the fourth generation evaluator seeks to
portray the views of each group of stakeholders on the program
(Lincoln and Guba 1985, 339-344; Guba and Lincoln 1989, 151-55,
178-80, 204-013).  To do this, the fourth generation evaluator
starts by collecting data from one group of stakeholders through
semi-structured interviews; then uses the constant comparative
method to develop categories of <I>claims</I> (favorable assertions
about program impact), <I>concerns</I> (unfavorable assertions
about program impact), and <I>issues </I>(actions about which
people disagree) as seen by that group (Guba and Lincoln 1989,
39-40).  Guba and Lincoln illustrate the meaning of these terms
with the following examples: a stakeholder <I>claims</I> that
a particular mode of reading instruction during one school year
results in more than a year's gain in tested reading scores; another
stakeholder is <I>concerned</I> that computer instruction reduces
students's abilities to do computations by hand; and stakeholders
disagree on the <I>issue</I> of introducing AIDS education into
primary schools.  
<P>
The evaluator discusses the emerging categories of claims, concerns,
and issues in subsequent interviews.  In this way, the evaluator
acts as a facilitator, helping the group's members to refine,
change, or modify their initial perspectives.  The evaluator challenges
and probes the stakeholders's initial views through other means
as well, for instance, providing information from the professional
literature and program documents, and describing how the evaluator
or other groups of stakeholders see the program's claims, concerns,
and issues.  Guba and Lincoln aptly characterize this whole data
collection and analysis process as a circle, because the evaluator
will likely have to go back to those first interviewed in order
to discuss with them categories which only emerged subsequently
(Ibid, 152).
<P>
In the process, some of the initial issues voiced by stakeholders
may be resolved.  Others will remain, representing the real tasks
and issues facing the program.  At this point, the evaluator prepares
an annotated list (agenda) of these, including any information
which elucidates them, and facilitates negotiation among the various
groups of stakeholders as to what actions should be taken (Guba
and Lincoln 1989, 214-23).   For instance, in a fourth generation
evaluation of a USAID program in Malawi, the articulated issues
concerned initially the priorities for allocating funds among
various components.  In the course of the evaluation, though,
this was resolved, while a new issue emerged of how to define
the roles and responsibilities of project officers in monitoring
performance.  The evaluator acted as a catalyst and recorder in
meetings on this issue by the working group responsible for project
coordination (Fehnel 1991, 17).
<P>
The rationale and potential for applying a fourth generation methodology
is most obvious when an on-going program requires a diagnostic
evaluation of its problems.  In other words, fourth generation
evaluation was really intended for situations where the stakeholders
in a program wish to decide on how to improve it.  However, elements
of the fourth generation methodology could potentially be adapted
to less obvious contexts, for instance, an impact evaluation of
an already completed program.  In this situation, the stakeholders
are those who have an interest in the evaluation, not the program.
  These stakeholders probably have contending views on issues
such as the purpose of the evaluation, the questions to be addressed,
and possibly even the methods or type of data which should be
collected.  In principle, the constant comparative method, as
modified by Guba and Lincoln, could be applicable to defining,
developing and discussing issues such as these.
<P>
In addition, the case in Section 4 raises the question of whether
CDR researchers could apply this methodology to structure and
facilitate discussions with Danida staff about research topics
and projects.
<P>
<a name=uti></a><B>3.2 Utilization-focused Evaluation</B>
<P>
Patton (1986) shares the view which donor agency staff eventually
adopted as the result of their initial experiences with evaluating
aid:  evaluations must answer the questions which users actually
have, and provide information which they genuinely want.  To achieve
this, Patton argues that evaluators have to consider how each
decision which they make in the course of the evaluation will
ultimately affect the usefulness of the information provided.
 A utilization-focused methodology accordingly consists of procedures
to help the evaluator take those decisions which best enhance
the prospects for the evaluation being utilized.  These procedures
largely boil down to how and why to involve stakeholders in this
decision-making.  
<P>
The primary role of the utilization-focused evaluator remains
information-gathering and analysis, in contrast to fourth generation
evaluation.  However, working with stakeholders to arrive at decisions
which are appropriate to their particular situation, may require
the evaluator to take on additional roles:  collaborator, trainer,
group facilitator, politician, organizational analyst, colleague,
expert, diplomat, problem solver (Ibid, 319).  
<P>
Utilization-focused evaluation grew out of a widespread concern
in the U.S. and Europe during the late 1960s and 1970s that evaluations
were not having much of an impact.  Patton quotes numerous studies
and literature reviews on this subject from the era, one of which
concludes <I>&quot;...the recent literature is unanimous in announcing
the general failure of evaluation to affect decision-making in
a significant way&quot; </I> (Wholey et al 1970, 46 as quoted
in Patton 1986, 23).  
<P>
The situation prompted Patton and a team of researchers to investigate
the reasons why some evaluations proved useful, while others did
not.  Patton's team randomly selected twenty U.S. national health
program evaluations to use as case studies (Patton et al 1977;
Patton 1986, 30-32).  The researchers then extracted from the
literature eleven factors which were supposed to affect the utilization
of a study, and asked the key informants selected for each case
study to comment on these (Patton 1986, 45).  Only one of these
factors, political considerations, emerged as consistently important
in explaining utilization.  
<P>
The other factor which emerged as clearly important was unexpected.
 After having respondents comment on each of the eleven factors,
the researchers asked the interviewees to identify the single
most important factor explaining why an evaluation did or did
not have an impact.  <I>&quot;Time after time,&quot;</I> Patton
writes, <I>&quot;the factor they identified was not on our list.
 Rather, they responded in terms of the importance of individual
people&quot;</I> (Ibid, 46).  The researchers labeled this the
&quot;personal factor,&quot; and Patton describes it as follows:
<P>
<I> The personal factor is the presence of an identifiable individual
or group of people who personally cared about the evaluation and
the information generated.  Where such a person or group was present,
evaluations were used; where the personal factor was absent, there
was a correspondingly marked absence of evaluation impact.  The
personal factor represents the leadership, interest, enthusiasm,
determination, commitment, assertiveness, and caring of specific,
individual people.  These are the people who are actively seeking
information to reduce decision uncertainties so as to increase
their ability to predict the outcomes of programmatic activity
and enhance their own discretion as decision makers.  These are
the primary users of evaluation&quot;</I> (Ibid, 45).
<P>
Given this research finding, a utilization-focused methodology
begins with the identification of the primary users and stakeholders.
 This means locating the particular individuals who have a genuine
interest in the evaluation data, and are willing to take the time
and effort to work with the evaluators.  Patton specifically cautions
against the practice of identifying &quot;audiences&quot; or organizations
as the stakeholders/primary users.  In such cases, the evaluator
winds up speculating about their information needs, and so in
the end, the evaluator decides what information is needed.  The
task, rather, is to find people who can speak for themselves about
the answers they need (Ibid, 52-53).
<P>
Patton also warns against identifying the wrong people, i.e.,
those who are passive or disinterested.  In commenting on the
findings of another research project similar to his own, he writes,
<P>
<I> &quot;Such findings are sometimes interpreted as meaning simply
that the <U>amount</U> of contact between decision makers and
evaluators should be increased.  But our data on the personal
factor suggest that increased contact with the wrong persons (i.e.,
people who are not oriented toward the use of evaluative information)
is likely to accomplish little&quot;</I>  (Ibid, 50).
<P>
Two of the traps which lead to identifying incorrectly the primary
users are to assume the latter are those (1) in positions of authority
or (2) who funded the evaluation.  In the former case, those higher
in the hierarchy may be less appropriate than a lower-level person
who is enthusiastic, interested, committed, assertive, and competent
(Ibid, 51).  In the latter case, 
<P>
<I> &quot;Often, they simply believe that evaluation is a good
thing, ought to be done, helps programs, and keeps people on their
toes.  They do not care about the content of a specific evaluation,
they only care that evaluation--any evaluation--takes place. 
They mandate the process, but not the substance&quot;</I> (Ibid,
54).
<P>
Once the primary users have been identified, the evaluator can
take the optional second step of organizing them into a working
task force.  Alternatively, they can work with the evaluator throughout
the evaluation process on some more informal basis.
<P>
The third step in the methodology involves working with the primary
users to define and assess the questions and issues to be addressed
through the evaluation.  Patton suggests that the evaluator holds
a workshop with the primary users for this purpose, with the evaluator
acting as group facilitator (Ibid, 75-77).
<P>
Some of the characteristics of appropriate questions for a utilization-focused
evaluation are obvious (Ibid, 69-73).  The users have to want
information in order to answer the question, as opposed to questions
to which they already know the answers.  The users personally
have to want the questions answered, as opposed to questions which
they believe someone else may or should want answered.  
<P>
In addition, the questions have to be empirical, that is, answers
are based on data rather than values or judgement.  As stated
above, the role of the utilization-focused evaluator is primarily
to collect and analyze empirical information, which will be used
for the purpose of making judgements and taking action.  The stakeholders
will have the primary responsibility for the latter, even if the
evaluator offers his or her own judgements and recommendations
for action.  For instance, the evaluator will establish whether
a program activity had an impact; whether the impact constitutes
an improvement will vary, depending on who is making the judgement
(Ibid, 70-71).
<P>
Also, good questions are ones which users can indicate how they
would use the answers, once available.  The users may well not
be able to point to a single decision which they would take based
on the evaluation's findings, but they 
<P>
<I> &quot;ought to be able to indicate where their knowledge uncertainties
lie, what activities, actions, and options are clouded by those
uncertainties, and how evaluative information would increase their
potential for doing a better job and making the program more effective&quot;</I>
(Ibid, 74).
<P>
As Patton argues, <I>&quot;If they cannot indicate future usefulness
at the outset, there is no reason to believe that they will be
able to do so after the evaluation&quot;</I> (Ibid, 74).   In
addition, the users have to assess whether, given the expected
use to which the information will put, the evaluation is worth
doing (Ibid, 331).
<P>
The next step in the methodology is to design the actual data
collection process.  If stakeholders are not involved at this
stage, the evaluator risks collecting data in which the users
do not believe, or which they do not accept as valid answers to
their questions.  For instance, it is no good collecting qualitative
data, if the users will only accept quantitative data.  Also,
the evaluator must once again check that the users really will
use the information once available.  Patton advises the evaluator
to hold a session to do a simulated analysis of the data, focusing
on how it would help the users take action.
<P>
<I> &quot;The evaluator prepares for this session by organizing
fabricated results, some positive and some negative, on the most
important issues.  For example, suppose the major outcome variable
for a vocational training program is the job placement rate. 
The evaluator might present data showing a placement rate of 40%
for black participants and 75% for white participants.  The stakeholders
are asked: 'What do these results mean? What actions would you
take based on these results? How would you use these data?'&quot;</I>
(Ibid, 247).
<P>
After the data have been collected, a similar step occurs in which
stakeholders participate in interpreting the findings.  The final
steps in the methodology are for the evaluator to facilitate the
intended use of the evaluation results by the users, and possibly
to disseminate the findings to a larger group of potential secondary
users (Ibid, 331-32).
<P>
Patton (Ibid, 340-44) describes one example of an actual utilization-focused
evaluation, which happens to be of a USAID agricultural extension
project.  Although the evaluation ran simultaneously with implementation,
the former did seek data on impacts.  When the funders decided
the project's future, they would want some indication of the project's
effectiveness and impact.  The evaluators were able to provide
that information when the decision-makers needed it, and that
was critical to securing continued funding (Ibid, 342-43).  In
short, in line with the premises of the utilization-focused approach,
the emphasis was placed on reducing decision-makers uncertainties
about a specific decision, rather than maximizing the quality
of the data on impact for its own sake.
<P>
<a name=cas></a><H3>4. Case: Collaboration to Develop Research on Project Impact</H3>
<P>
Textbooks on social science methods and methodology typically
begin at the point after the researcher has selected a topic or
question for study.  They provide few or no guidelines on how
the researcher should search for a research topic.  When this
very preliminary phase of research is addressed, the assumption
is that it is a largely individual process: the researcher reviews
the academic literature looking for gaps (Silverman 1985, 4-12).
 <P>
This is sound advice.  However, one can envision a supplementary
process particularly in the case of applied research, appropriate
when the researcher wishes to maximize the chances that the research
findings will be useful to a specific group of users.  The example
in this section will illustrate such a process. 
<P>
It proceeds through three stages.  First, a researcher works with
Danida staff to develop a list of research ideas in a given area,
in this case, the impact of rural drinking water projects.  Next,
that researcher develops one idea into a research proposal suitable
for the Council for Development Research (<I>R&aring;det for Ulandsforskning</I>
(RUF)) funding.  Finally, another researcher selects a different
idea from the list, and also develops it into a RUF-destined proposal.
<P>
<a name=def></a><B>4.1 Defining the Research Agenda</B>
<P>
This sub-section describes four steps in a collaborative process
aimed at developing <I>ideas</I> for research.  Under the present
system, researchers who wish to apply for a RUF grant via CDR
first submit a research idea to CDR, whose <I>Centern&aelig;vnet</I>
then decides which ones should be developed into full-fledged
research proposals.  The process by which a researcher develops
an idea is entirely left to the individual.  In the following
case, by contrast, the researcher uses an explicitly participatory
methodology to involve Danida staff in this most preliminary phase
of research.  The steps in this methodology are as follows:
<P>
<OL>
<li>Choose general area of research
<P>
<li>Define relevant Danida stakeholder groups
<P>
<li>Carry out semi-structured interviews and analysis within each
stakeholder group
<P>
<li>Present issues (ideas) paper to CDR and Danida for discussion</ol>

<P>
We will follow Kaj, a researcher who wishes to apply for a RUF
grant via CDR, as he proceeds through the four steps.
<P>
<B>1.  Kaj chooses the general area of research</B>
<P>
Kaj decides to look for research issues related to the impact
of rural drinking water projects.  Kaj alone makes this initial
decision about the general area for research, but based on transparent
and justifiable reasons which meet with the informal approval
of CDR researchers with whom Kaj discusses his choice.  
<P>
Four factors in particular lead Kaj to decide that he should look
for a topic related to the impact of rural drinking water projects.
 First, CDR is in the process of building up its research profile
on aid impact, and thus Kaj believes that research in this area
will carry with it good opportunities for collaboration and interchange
with other CDR researchers.  Second, the explicit principal objective
in Danish assistance to rural drinking water was direct poverty
alleviation, which is in line with the thrust of CDR's planned
research on aid impact.  Third, Danida has funded a large number
of now completed projects and programs in the rural drinking water
sector, hence it provides ample opportunity for finding a suitable
case to study impact.  Finally, Kaj has both research and implementation
experience in this sector, which he feels constitutes an indispensable
background for recognizing central issues for research.
<P>
<B>2.  Kaj defines the (two) groups of Danida stakeholders for
research in this area</B>
<P>
Based on his knowledge of Danida, Kaj immediately defines two
groups of potential stakeholders for his research, the TSA advisers
and the Evaluation Unit staff.  Kaj can imagine how both groups
could make use of information on water project impact in their
work.  However, since TSA advisers and Evaluation Unit staff have
very different roles and responsibilities within Danida, they
require different types of information and would put it to different
uses.  The relevant research issues will be correspondingly different
as well.
<P>
TSA advisers have the responsibility to oversee from a professional
viewpoint the design and implementation of projects and programs.
 TSA advisers, particularly those dealing with water projects,
are potentially interested in information on the impact of past
projects <I>to the extent this can provide lessons for current
and future projects</I>.  The research issues for TSA will likely
stem from the questions and uncertainties they face in managing
current assistance; the advisers are potentially interested in
information from experience to the extent it can reduce these
uncertainties.
<P>
Evaluation Unit staff have an interest and responsibility to see
that TSA advisers get such information, but the former do not
constitute stakeholders or primary users for this kind of information.
 They may help TSA get such information through summative evaluations,
for example, but the Evaluation Unit staff cannot themselves define
what the content of this information should be.  As Patton (1986,
54) explained, they may mandate the process but not the substance
of evaluation (see Section 3.2 above).  
<P>
However, the Evaluation Unit has recently become very obviously
responsible for accounting to the Danish parliament and people
on the effective use of Danish taxpayers's money by Danida.  For
instance, the parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee in 1994
requested the Minister for Development Cooperation to submit a
report on how and how well Danish assistance is being used to
achieve the overall objective of reducing poverty (Olsen and Udsholt
1995, 42).  The Evaluation Unit is in charge of the series of
evaluations commissioned in order to provide this information
(Danida 1995c, 1995d).  Consequently, Kaj imagines the Evaluation
Unit staff being potentially interested in information on the
impact of past projects <I>to the extent it indicates the effectiveness
with which Danish assistance has been used</I>, in reaching the
poverty alleviation or other objectives.
<P>
Defining stakeholder groups makes the subsequent process of semi-structured
interviewing and analysis more (1) manageable and (2) effective.
 Organizing stakeholders into groups, based on the type of issues
they are likely to identify, makes the process more manageable
in that it breaks it into blocks or phases.  Kaj can prepare for
and immerse himself in interviews around one type or set of issues,
before moving on to tackle the next.  The process is more effective
to the extent it allows the researcher to go into more depth.
 This can include identifying more stakeholders.  For instance,
the TSA advisers might direct Kaj to someone in the &quot;S-departments&quot;
or attached to an Embassy (who Kaj contacts by mail) who has a
particularly good grasp of the issues facing the sector in a particular
country.  The Evaluation Unit might put Kaj in touch with the
consultants working on the poverty alleviation evaluation.
<P>
<B>3.  Kaj carries out semi-structured interviewing and analysis
within each stakeholder group</B>
<P>
Kaj will engage in a process is modeled closely on that of fourth
generation evaluation, in which the role of the evaluator is to
help articulate, develop, and sharpen participants's views of
the issues.  It is therefore in stark contrast to the typical
attitude or approach of an interviewer, who tries to extract the
interviewee's pre-existing views <I>without</I> allowing the interview
process to affect them.  Kaj's interviews have more the character
of one-on-one seminars.  He is not there simply to listen, but
to engage in dialogue.  To do this, he must come prepared to ask
questions, but also to provide information from the professional
literature and program documents, and to share his own and other
informants's views on the emergent issues.
<P>
This has several implications for how Kaj prepares for and conducts
the interviews.  To illustrate this, our case continues with the
story of how Kaj interviews the TSA advisers.
<P>
Before Kaj goes into the first interview, he familiarizes himself
with the on-going drinking water projects and the Danida strategies
for the program countries which will receive Danish assistance
for rural drinking water supply.  Kaj also begins reading about
the issues in rural drinking water supply as seen by other major
donors, such as the World Bank, and described in the professional
literature.  
<P>
The first interview is short and very unstructured.  After explaining
his purpose in interviewing Danida staff, Kaj asks a series of
open-ended questions about a recently completed impact evaluation
of a Danida rural water supply program in Sri Lanka (Danida 1995a,
1995b).  Did the adviser find the report's conclusions about impact
believable?  Did she need and use this information?  Has she heard
anything about the Sri Lanka project, or similar types of projects,
which led her to draw her own conclusions about impact?  What
needs does she have for more information on the impact of rural
drinking water assistance in order to do her job?  This last question
forms the transition to talking about the issues and information
needs which the adviser encounters in the specific projects she
is presently supervising.  Kaj keeps the interview short, because
he will have to go back and re-interview the first respondents
as he gets more information and ideas about how Danida staff view
the possible research issues on aid impact.
<P>
Kaj analyzes this first interview before carrying out a second.
 This involves coding the transcript in terms of possible issues
and writing memos.  This could certainly be done &quot;by hand,&quot;
because the analysis of these interviews will not be as time-consuming
or extensive as in a typical qualitative research study.  However,
Kaj suspects that the actual research will entail extensive analysis
of qualitative data, which could most effectively be handled by
computer.  Therefore, he has investigated software for qualitative
data analysis, and narrowed the options to three: <I>NUD.IST</I>,
<I>Atlas/ti,</I> and <I>Folio VIEWS</I> (Weitman and Miles 1995,
115-128, 217-229, 238-256; <A HREF="http://qsr.latrobe.edu.au" target="_top">http://qsr.latrobe.edu.au</A>).  He decides
to familiarize himself more thoroughly with the capabilities of
<I>NUD.IST</I>, which CDR recently purchased on his recommendation,
by using it to analyze the Danida interview data.
<P>
In the next interview, Kaj asks similar questions, and in addition,
summarizes the views of the first adviser in each question area.
 Kaj also describes a tentative formulation of a research issue,
developed in one of the memos he wrote while analyzing the first
interview data.  Unfortunately, due to scheduling difficulties,
he has to conduct two interviews the same day, and so cannot analyze
the one before going on to the next.  In general, though, he manages
to feed the analysis of one interview into the succeeding ones.
 In the process, his questions become more focused.  The balance
of the interview shifts toward discussing possible issues, rather
than responding to the general questions he used in the first
interviews.  Finally, he goes back to the first advisers interviewed,
to get their views on the issues as they have emerged.  At that
point, he writes up a short description of these issues, and presents
it for discussion at a TSA meeting.
<P>
<B>4.  Kaj presents a final issues paper</B>
<P>
Kaj goes through a process with the Evaluation Unit staff similar
to the one just described for TSA.  He then prepares a final issues
paper, which combines the two early ones and incorporates the
comments which he received on these from the respective stakeholder
groups.  It also includes a brief statement of which issue he
would like to develop into a RUF proposal and why.  He will discuss
this paper formally and informally with representatives from CDR,
TSA, and the Evaluation and Research Department before submitting
his project idea to <I>Forretningsudvalget</I> (FU), the first
step in applying for a RUF grant via CDR.
<P>
<a name=app></a><B>4.2 Applied Research Useful in Assistance Design and Management</B>
<P>
The topic which interests Kaj came up in the discussions with
TSA.  When the water advisers talked about current issues in their
work, it emerged that many of these related to questions about
whether and how to implement a demand-driven approach to rural
water supply, a new and untested strategy which is currently being
promoted by the World Bank in particular.  For much of the past
two decades, Danida and other donors had worked on the assumption
that governments had the responsibility to provide a minimum standard
of drinking water supplies to the rural population.  Donors had
therefore stepped in to assist governments in this role by funding
and implementing huge projects and programs to construct rural
domestic water schemes.  For the past few years, though, the World
Bank had promoted the idea that the communities should have the
primary responsibility to provide and maintain their water supplies,
by buying services from the private sector, while the government
acted primarily in a facilitating role.
<P>
The TSA advisers saw a number of positive points in this new demand-driven
approach to rural water supply.  For one, it meshed well with
the new overall Danida policy to support programs rather than
projects.  Second, it was based on an analysis of past problems
with donor assistance to rural water supply which corresponded
to Danida's experience in the sector.  The major drawbacks were
that there was little evidence to support the claims and assumptions
on which the proposed strategy for future assistance rested, and
that the strategic recommendations themselves were extremely vague.
 Consequently, the final issues paper included several research
topics related to the demand-driven approach.  
<P>
One of the topics concerned how and how well communities and other
local institutions can play the new roles expected of them.  The
demand-driven approach, in water supply as well as other sectors,
presents a series of arguments as to why communities will be effective
and fair managers.  However, the policy documents present little
empirical evidence to support these claims.  Research could establish
the conditions under which communities had successfully managed
water schemes, and how effective and fair this management had
been.  Such information would provide a more realistic basis on
which to design and manage projects and programs which ultimately
depended on community management.
<P>
In the end, Kaj selected this topic as the basis for his research
proposal for a number of reasons.  First, empirical information
could clearly contribute useful information to a discussion of
the issue.  Decisions about some of the other issues required
more judgement and interpretation of existing information, than
gathering new information.  Second, Kaj had the background, skills,
and interest to do the study.  Third, a couple of the TSA advisers
were quite enthusiastic about research into community management,
and interested in keeping in contact with Kaj as he carried it
out.  Fourth, the topic fit into one of the areas at CDR.
<P>
To develop the topic into a research proposal, Kaj needs to define
the research questions.  His preliminary reading in the academic
literature leads Kaj to focus these questions on local institutions:
 what local institutions take on management responsibilities?;
what is the division of labor among local institutions in regard
to scheme management?; and what factors explain the effectiveness
of a particular type of institution?.  In this context, &quot;institutions&quot;
includes both organizations--e.g., village water committees, district
councils, district water departments--and indigenous institutions
such as clan societies and rotating credit groups.  &quot;Local&quot;
refers to anything from a large group to the district/block/prefecture
level.  
<P>
Kaj then sketches out a methodology to answer these questions,
based on carrying out a series of case studies of rural communities
which have successfully managed either a handpumped or gravity
scheme to supply drinking water.  In each community, Kaj will
use observation and interviews to gather information on the individuals
and institutions which perform various operation and maintenance
tasks--preventive maintenance, repairs, operational tasks, revenue
payment, revenue collection, etc.--and factors which seem to explain
why they perform this task.  By comparing this information across
communities/case studies, he hopes to conceptualize better some
of the factors cited in the literature to explain performance,
develop other explanatory concepts, or both.
<P>
Up to this point, Kaj had only discussed his ideas for research
questions and a field methodology with other CDR researchers.
 With something on paper now, he goes back to the TSA advisers
who were most interested in the research.  They agree with many
of his ideas, but also argue for several major changes.  First,
the TSA adviser with an engineering background argues that the
technical quality of operation and maintenance has to be established
at the outset for each case study.  Water flowing from the taps
and pumps on a regular basis does not necessarily mean the system
has been well-maintained.  One has to establish to what extent
a scheme really is successfully managed before attempting to explain
why.
<P>
Second, the advisers do not want the case studies restricted to
communities which received schemes through donor water projects.
 The advisers's main interest lies in getting as complete a picture
of successful community management as possible.  Therefore, they
would like Kaj to look at communities which developed successful
management systems without the benefit of donor assistance.  Third,
the advisers want the research to evaluate community management
in a cross-section of schemes from each Danida project included
in the study.  In other words, in addition to learning something
about the ingredients for success, the advisers also wanted a
rapid indication of whether the particular Danida projects had
widespread or limited success in promoting successful community
management.  
<P>
The first point is the most difficult to resolve, because it points
to Kaj's lack of qualifications to carry out the research single-handed.
 Kaj and TSA finally agree that the latter would finance an engineer
to work with Kaj for one to two weeks per project in doing a rapid
appraisal of the scheme operation and maintenance on a cross-section
of projects.  (This would also address the third point.)  This
engineer will also help Kaj to recruit a local engineer to advise
Kaj on technical aspects of more detailed case studies done in
a few communities.  In regard the second point, Kaj agrees to
include one to two examples of non-donor assisted water schemes
managed by the communities, if any can be identified in the same
geographic area where the rest of the research will be carried
out.  
<P>
Kaj now has to develop the detailed methodology, including methods
choices.  However, the case story will stop short of describing
this, as sufficient discussion issues have already raised.  The
next sub-section will broaden the basis for discussing these,
through presenting a short second case study.
<P>
<a name=appl></a><B>4.3 Applied Research Useful in Political Accountability</B>
<P>
An abridged version of Kaj's final issues paper appears in <I>Den
Ny Verden</I>.  There it catches the attention of a Roskilde University
student, Andrea, who is interested in doing a Ph.D. on the unintended
consequences of donor interventions in rural areas.  Her interest
in the subject comes from a book by James Ferguson (1990), who
argues that even failed development projects serve to expand the
power of the state.  Kaj's final issues paper includes one on
the unintended benefits and costs from donor-finance rural water
supply schemes.  Although it is far from clear that the drinking
water projects will provide evidence in support of Ferguson's
thesis--nor would Andrea wish merely to parrot his analysis--she
decides to develop the issue identified by Kaj into a RUF-proposal.
<P>
This particular issue arose out of Kaj's discussion with the Evaluation
Unit staff.  The latter had initially assumed that research on
rural water supply and poverty alleviation should address the
same broad questions around which a team of consultants had organized
their multi-sectoral evaluation of the impact of Danish aid on
poverty.  These questions did indeed provide a starting point
for the first semi-structured interviews between Kaj, the Danida
staff, and the consultants, but gradually they identified issues
which were much more specific to rural water supply and its presumed
impact on poverty.  The final issues paper includes two such issues,
concerning respectively the health impact of water projects, and
the unintended benefits and costs from the donor-financed schemes.
 It is the second which interests Andrea.
<P>
Andrea contacts Kaj for a briefing on this issue.  Kaj explains
that recent evaluations of Danida water projects had made passing
references to the commercial uses to which some consumers were
putting water, especially on piped schemes.  This situation raises
a number of questions about who really benefits from this infrastructure.
 Do local elites in fact capture the lion's share of benefits
from the schemes?  Does the unintended use of water threaten the
intended benefits, for instance, because the system cannot supply
everyone with enough water for domestic purposes?  Who bears the
costs of maintaining the system?  How do the poor themselves view
the situation?  Finally, and perhaps most interesting, how do
problematic situations come about?  Do local elites so regularly
capture the benefits of the water supply that one must consider
it inevitable, or are there specific socio-economic, institutional,
design, or other factors which encourage such situations?  The
answers to such questions will indicates the effectiveness of
investment in rural water supply as a direct poverty alleviation
measure.
<P>
Andrea next discusses her possible research on this issue with
the Evaluation Unit staff.  Their main concern is that research
be based on case studies of specific Danida projects or programs.
 In other words, while the staff are interested in generalizable
conclusions about rural water supply investment as a means to
alleviate poverty, they also want a clear picture of how Danida
investments in particular have performed in this respect.  Andrea
suggests that &quot;performance&quot; is probably best gauged
in relative terms: did some Danida projects do better than others;
or did Danida projects do better than other donor and non-donor
projects?
<P>
In line with this discussion, Andrea develops a methodology based
on a studying about fifteen schemes financed through the Danida
water project in Tanzania, and about as many again which were
financed by UNICEF, SIDA, and the Tanzanian government.  This
will allow her to say something about the problems in general
with benefit distribution on rural water supplies, and how well
Danida in particular dealt with those problems.  Confining the
research to one country limits somewhat the diversity in local
conditions, and of course eliminates any comparative analysis
of how national level factors may influence the local.  On the
other hand, Andrea can study a greater number of schemes by restricting
the research to Tanzania, which among other things, allows her
to do a more thorough case study of the Danida project, and thus
better meet the Evaluation Unit's demand for information on the
impact of a Danida project.
<P>
<a name=con></a><H3>5. Conclusions</H3>
<P>
The methodology which Kaj and Andrea used rests on (at least)
two premises:  that CDR and its researchers will invest substantially
more time than at present in research topic selection; and that
CDR will modify the present procedures for approving research
proposals to be sent to RUF.
<P>
Collaboration takes time.  Collaboration between CDR and Danida
staff to identify topics for research will add considerably to
the total time required to develop a research proposal.  It is
analogous to the situation when donors added community participation
objectives and components to development projects.  The &quot;hardware&quot;
of projects, e.g., the construction of the water schemes, could
not be completed as quickly once the community had to be involved
at each phase.  Likewise, Kaj and Andrea's approach adds several
weeks, at least, of background reading, data collection, analysis
to the research development process.  
<P>
CDR's present procedures for approving proposals prior to their
submission to RUF would have to be modified in order to accommodate
this.  Collaboration along the lines described above would take
place prior to the first stage of the present CDR process, the
submission of an initial research idea.  Researchers would be
unlikely to invest the weeks of work necessary for collaboration,
if the <I>Forretningsudvalget</I> (FU) and <I>Centern&aelig;vnet</I>
(CN) provide no financial support during this period, and give
no weight to collaboration in the decision of whether to pass
the proposal onto the second stage.  Also, present procedures
do not allow for Danida staff to be on the committee which submits
the recommendation to FU and CN regarding whether or not to approve
the proposal for the second and third phases.  Without this, collaboration
is more likely to harm than help a researcher's chances in getting
a proposal passed.
<P>
These comments on the premises underlying the hypothetical case
demonstrate how it can be used to further discussion on the subject
of collaboration between Danida and CDR.  The story of Kaj and
Andrea does not present a solution or recommendation; rather it
offers a tool for discussion.  By pointing out what they do and
do not like or find feasible in the case, CDR and Danida staff
can generate ideas for a better methodology of collaboration.

<hr>
<h4>This Report</h4>
The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) conducts periodic reviews to improve the individual and collective development co-operation efforts of its members.
<p>
The peer review is prepared by the Secretariat and involves staff from development agencies in other DAC member countries. A draft report of the team is prepared by the Secretariat and it forms the basis for a review meeting with the member.
<p>
This publication contains the conclusions as agreed by DAC following the review meeting on 24 February 1994, as well as the report prepared by the Secretariat team.
<p>
<h4>Main Points</h4>
Despite a growing budget for aid, the British aid programme, particularly the bilateral component, is under severe pressure. The proportion of aid to gross national product has declined in recent years and budget projections till 1997 show little growth in real terms. A concern discussed in the report is the growing commitment of aid resources to multilateral organisations. Unless total aid resources are increased, the distinctive bilateral programme would be under severe pressure, with consequent impacts on the non-govermental and other organisations that are rely on these funds to a large extent.
<p>
The report reviews the volume and distribution of aid, geograpically and thematically. Special attention is given to the linkages between aid policy and other economic and political instruments for cooperation with developing countries. The organisation and administration of the aid system is described and the evaluation system in reviewed. A description of UK aid to Uganda is included as a way to provide insights into the operation and management of the aid programme.

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Swiss Development Cooperation</h3>

Official Swiss development cooperation started in the early 1960s, based on a strong voluntary and
charitable tradition and on Switzerland's role as an international humanitarian intermediary. Public support
for development cooperation has always been active, as can be judged from the population's high financial
contributions and active political participation. Although attention was rather focused on emergencies and
disasters, there is a shift away from traditional development issues to international environmental problems,
economic interdependence and consequences of consumption and production patterns of Northern countries
for the South. Government and NGOs are very active in development education, and their information
activities underline their very independent position. For instance, the accession of Switzerland in 1992 to the
Bretton Woods institutions is not only acclaimed in official documents, but also critically followed with
regard to the institution's internal functioning and their role in poverty alleviation. 
<p> 
Net official development assistance in 1992 stood at US $ 1 139 million, or 0.46 per cent of GNP, including
Switzerland's first year's contributions to the IMF and World Bank. Since the 1980s, ODA grew
considerably (in 1987 0.27 per cent of GNP). However, the target of 0.4 per cent of GNP, formulated in
1992 at UNCED, will not be reached in 2000. Due to economic constraints, the ODA budget for the period
1993 - 1996 will reach a level between 0.34 - 0.35 per cent of GNP. Over the years multilateral
contributions amounted to around one-third of ODA; in 1992 to 41 per cent. Since Switzerland's accession
to the Bretton Woods institutions, a permanent shift towards more multilateral cooperation is presently being
discussed. 
<p>
<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>
<p>
Swiss development cooperation programmes are managed by two federal ministries. The Directorate for
Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid, known as the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC,
created in 1961) which comes under the competence of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. SDC is responsible
for technical cooperation, parts of the financial cooperation, and humanitarian assistance, amounting to 77
per cent of total Swiss aid in 1992. The Federal Office for Foreign Economic Affairs (OFAEE) in the
Ministry of Public Economy is responsible for a major part of financial support, amounting to around 20 per
cent of total Swiss aid in 1992. A small but growing fraction of the total aid (4.1 per cent in 1992) is
managed by the Federal Ministry of Finance, the Federal Ministry of Education and other ministries, and
2.0 per cent of total aid (in 1992) by the Municipalities and Cantons. Swiss emergency aid is managed by a
special Division of SDC, that takes autonomous decisions on the basis of a multiannual credit separately
from the cooperation budget voted by Parliament.
<p>
Implementation is done on the basis of subsidiarity: the Federal Government is not allowed to do things
which can be done by other institutions in Swiss society. Project preparation, implementation and evaluation
are mainly carried out by NGOs, consultants and enterprises, through various arrangements. Traditionally
the Government has a job-sharing relationship with the NGOs. SDC also directly finances international
NGOs and NGOs in developing countries. Specific aspects of the aid programme are implemented by other
ministries, for instance scholarships and the Global Environment Facility by the Ministry of the Interior. In
concentration countries the SDC has Coordination Offices for implementation. 
<p>
Both offices, the SDC and the OFAEE have a policy planning division. Consultants, NGOs and research
institutes are involved in policy planning. Allocations of responsibilities between the ministries, as well as
between the Government and outside groups (institutes, NGOs, enterprises) are finely tuned. These careful
processes of coordination may result in time consuming procedures. Two bodies that manage parts of the
financial aid and also have a coordinating function are the Export Risk Guarantee Commission and the
Board of the National Bank. 
<p>
<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>
<p>
Switzerland has a Consultative Commission on Development Cooperation for the SDC. One Sub-Committee
follows the implementation of the Debt Reduction Facility (created in 1991) and another Sub-Committee
follows Swiss policies in the Bretton Woods institutions. The Commission was established in 1976, when the
Federal Law on International Cooperation was accepted by Parliament. It is the Commission's task to advise
the Government on development cooperation policy, to scrutinise the objectives and priorities of
development cooperation, and to draw up recommendations on its own initiative. The Commission
contributes to the preparation of policy documents before final versions are written and sent to Parliament.
<p>
The Advisory Commission has 15 Members including Members of Parliament from all political parties,
representatives from the business-community, trade-unions, the research community, from one umbrella
NGO, and from other groups in Swiss society that have an interest in development cooperation. Members
are appointed by the Government for a four year period, with a maximum of four periods. The
Commission's secretariat is located at the Policy and Research Section of the Policy and Planning Division
of the SDC. The Head of the Policy and Research Section is the - part-time - Executive Secretary of the
Commission.
<p>
The Commission generally meets 4 times a year, unless specific issues warrant extra meetings. The agenda
is prepared by the Secretary in consultation with the Director General of SDC and the Chairman of the
Commission. The Chairman can draw up its own agenda and raise specific topics for discussion. Its mandate
allows the Commission to go beyond the policy areas of the SDC: it has right of initiatives, although
restricted. It can present its views to other ministries or the Government. The Sub-commission on the
Bretton Woods institutions meets around ten times a year. It is not known whether the Commission has its
own budget and information gathering activities. Presently the Commission prepares documents for the
coming UN Conference on Population and Development, the Social Summit, and the World Conference on
Women and Development. Documents are being prepared on world trade and the GATT. Each December
the Commission discusses the country reports of SDC and the various instruments of development
cooperation.
<p>
The results of the Commission's discussions are laid down in protocols for the officials of the ministries
concerned and for members of the Government. They are for internal use only and are very seldom
published. Beside this Commission, only one other coordinating body is known, the Committee on Foreign
Economic Policy which advises the Government on questions of trade and exports.
<p>
Parliament actively debates issues of development cooperation, although it appears to concentrate more on
general foreign policy matters than on specific topics of development cooperation. The long process of
decision making by consensus may generate a sense of superfluity of discussions in Parliament. 
<p>
<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>
<p>
Switzerland's many NGOs have a long standing and effective relationship with the Government for
implementation of projects and programmes. In the 1950s traditional Swiss NGOs, such as Helvetas,
Swisscontact, Swissaid and a number of Church-related NGOs, directed their attention from Europe to the
Third World. In later years many solidarity groups and voluntary sending organisations were founded. There
are around 165 development NGOs. Governmental NGO programmes are managed by the SDC. 
<p>
The SDC co-finances projects of individual NGOs (8.2 per cent of bilateral assistance in 1992), finances
their general costs, and contracts NGOs for SDC projects. In 1991 27.5 per cent of the total public and
private development assistance was received and spent by NGOs. There is only one umbrella-type NGO
organisation taking part in a formal policy dialogue with the Federal Government, the Swiss Aid Agencies
Coalition (representing five NGOs). The Coalition is also represented in the Consultative Commission and
its Sub-committees, and in the Consultative Committee on Foreign Economic Policy.
<p>
NGOs follow Swiss official development policy critically. They are often initiators of referenda on
development issues. One NGO campaigned, unsuccessfully, against Swiss membership of the World Bank.
In 1989, on the occasion of the 700th Anniversary of the Swiss Confederation, NGOs campaigned
successfully for reducing LDC debt to Switzerland. In 1991 the Parliament approved the establishment of a
Debt Reduction Facility, over and above the regular ODA budget. For three other issues relevant to the
South the required number of signatures for a referendum have been collected: the demand for a complete
halt to Swiss arms exports, the reduction of military expenditure and, third, the protection of bio-diversity
against scientific and commercial exploitation. NGOs opposed with success further budget cuts for 1992.
<p>
The many topics of policy dialogue with the Government include: larger NGO participation in government
commissions and delegations, additional funds for the increase in multilateral contributions and for the
growing costs of peacekeeping, evaluation of multilateral and of financial aid activities, World Bank policy
and poverty alleviation, and implementation of ecologically sustainable development in Switzerland as well.
<p>
According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey 24 institutes in Switzerland qualify as Development Research
and Training Institutes. In 1993, SDC and the Swiss National Research Foundation started a programme for
promotion of research on Development and Environment by joint institutions in the South and in
Switzerland. Together with the Swiss Academy of Sciences, SDC promotes research in developing
countries. Many researchers are involved in government programmes and activities.

<p>
In 1974 an Advisory Council on Development Cooperation (Beirat) was established in order to guarantee a
coordinated development policy and implementation. The Council could advise the Federal Chancellor on
these matters. The ca. 50 members of the Council are appointed by the Federal Chancellor and represent all
major sections in society, including Members of Parliament of the Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs,
representatives of NGOs, industry, and trade unions. It is chaired by the State Secretary for Integration and
Development Cooperation.
<p>
The Council meets three or four times a year. Meetings are held at the request of the State Secretary. The
Council does not write reports or recommendations. It is a panel for discussion with the State Secretary.
Discussions are considered as an input for policy formulation which is executed by the State Secretary and
the officials involved. The Council's main function is preserving the support for development cooperation in
Austrian society. It discusses amongst others: DAC reports, the negotiations with EU and the government's
Three-Year Programme for Development Cooperation. The operational criteria for Austrian development
cooperation were elaborated in 1979 and 1980 by a working group of the Council, based on the 1974 Law.
The Council appears to play a minor role since. The Council has no Secretariat. Members can be contacted
through the Federal Chancellery. The Council does not publish any documents of its discussions and its
present agenda is not known.
<p>
In order to improve its functioning working groups were established in 1992 on environmental questions and
on human rights. In the DAC Aid Review of 1992/93 the Austrian government is invited to reconsider the
role of the Advisory Council with regard to obtaining the necessary support of the population for an
enlarged and improved aid programme. In view of greater efficiency, a reduction of the number of Council
Members should be considered. 
<p>
Parliament has a Standing Sub-Committee on Development Policy (under the responsibility of the Standing
Committee for Foreign Affairs) which sets its own agenda. Parliament apparently does not show great
interest in questions of aid. Debates on government reports submitted to Parliament have been held
belatedly. In 1988 Parliament conducted an enquiry into the development assistance, but there has been no
active follow up reported.

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of German Development Cooperation</h3>

German development cooperation started in the 1950s. Initially it was implemented mainly through private
and independent organisations; some of which originally were created for reconstruction purposes in
Germany after the Second World War (for instance the Credit Institute for Reconstruction, KfW in 1948).
Development cooperation is strongly supported by the Government and the public for political and
humanitarian reasons, and been widely debated and discussed. Presently, the rather well informed public
seems to shift its attention towards more structural global problems and the need for changes in the North,
while domestic problems seem to be a greater cause for concern.
<p>
German net official development assistance in 1992 stood at US $ 7 572 million, or 0.39 per cent of GNP.
After a substantial increase in the late 1980s the volume might drop under the DAC average of 0.33 per
cent in the coming years. A fairly constant 30 per cent of ODA is being disbursed through multilateral
channels: in 1992 15 per cent, plus 16 per cent through the EU.
<p>
<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>
<p>
Official development cooperation is not based on an organic law. Development aid is regulated through
various specific laws. The competency for development cooperation of the Federal Government and the
Federal States ('L&#228;nder') is laid down in the chancellor's decisions of 1962 and 1988. The Federal
Government is responsible for the overall policy, planning and coordination, the States have declared
themselves responsible for assisting in the implementation of projects, training in Germany, and providing
experts and research facilities.
<p>
Technical and financial development cooperation is the responsibility of the Minister for Economic
Cooperation, who is a full member of Cabinet, and who heads the Ministry for Economic Cooperation and
Development (BMZ, created in 1961). There is also a State Secretary for Development Cooperation.
General political relations with developing countries are the competence of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs,
external economic relations (including trade) of the Minister for Economics and monetary policy is the
competence of the Minister for Finance. Budgets for development cooperation need the approval of the
Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Finance before the are sent to Parliament. After the Unification and the
abolishment of the Ministry for Economic Cooperation of the former GDR Affairs (MWZ, founded in
1990), a temporary service was set up in Berlin, which is to be integrated into the BMZ. 
<p>
In 1990 about a quarter of total ODA was provided by other departments: the Ministry for Foreign Affairs
(mainly for cultural and humanitarian assistance), and the Federal L„nder (mainly for scholarships (imputed
students costs) and technical assistance), other federal departments (mainly the Ministries for Finance, for
Agriculture and for Economics) and the KfW, a credit institute for capital assistance. Formulation of aid
policies is BMZ's responsibility. However, all major projects and programmes are submitted by BMZ to all
other ministries that might be interested, in particular the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Finance
Ministry, and the Ministry for Economics. 
<p>
Implementation of aid is mainly subcontracted to two autonomous institutions: the German Agency for
Technical Cooperation (GTZ), and the KfW. Although most projects are implemented by these two
institutions, outside experts and institutes are often involved. For many sectors there are specialised
institutes - a.o. voluntary sending organisations and NGOs - that are involved in implementation,
independently and/or in cooperation with the Government, for instance the DEG (German Corporation for
Investment and Development), a promotion institute for cooperation between private enterprises. Various
channels of assistance and instruments are integrated in one country policy, project or programme.
<p>
Within the BMZ the Division for Regional Development Policy is amongst others responsible for country
related planning and coordination, while the Division for Targets and Planning for Development Policy
amongst others elaborates the principles and objectives of sectoral and inter-sectoral policy. 
<p>
In addition to BMZ eleven other departments, with which BMZ has long standing arrangements, manage
certain parts of ODA. In order to improve the, sometimes difficult, relationship between the BMZ and GTZ,
new organisational management structures for both institutions were implemented in 1988. However, the
final authority of the Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development still seems to be limited.
Interministerial communication appears to be ad hoc, and often limited to implementation level.
<p>
Basic policy papers were formulated successively in 1971, 1980 and 1991, when new criteria and indicators
were written. In addition, BMZ elaborates country concepts and -reports, (cross-) sector policy papers and
guidelines for the selection and assessment of projects, which are regularly up-dated. They are for internal
use only. Evaluations are frequently conducted and analyzed by a special unit in BMZ. They are made
available to the departments concerned and to the implementing agencies. Summaries of evaluations are
published. In 1991 a KfW evaluation report on a large number of projects was also published.
<p>
<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>
<p>
The BMZ has a Scientific Advisory Council to the Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development
(Beirat). The Council was installed in 1963. It is the task of the Council to advise and consult the Minister
on all issues concerning economic cooperation. The Council is an independent body that expresses its views
either on request of the Minister or at its own initiative in so-called 'statement-papers' or ad-hoc
consultations.
<p>
The nomination of new members is the exclusively the responsibility of the current members. Nominated
members are subsequently appointed by the Minister for a period of six years, that can be extended with one
more term. The members represent various academic fields and practical experiences in development
cooperation. The council presently has 25 members. One of the staff members of the policy planning
division at BMZ acts as the contact person for the Council. In addition, the chairman of the Council may
employ an assistant and a part-time secretary.
<p>
The Council meets three times a year. Discussion papers for the plenary sessions are prepared by small
working groups. During the plenary meetings the papers are discussed intensively. Revised papers are
presented to the Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development as an input into the discussion on
specific topics within the Ministry. Usually the Minister and/or his representatives attend the discussions of
the Council. The distinct scientific background of the members serves to ensure a sufficient input from
relevant sciences and experiences.
<p>
Apart from plenary meetings, the Council occasionally organises symposiums, for which a wider spectre of
participants is invited. Experts from NGOs, governmental agencies or researchers from disciplines not
represented in the Council, give presentations on topics on which the Council envisages to prepare a paper.
The Council does not have a budget. For the financing of activities, e.g. to have research done on its
behalf, it has to submit a request to the Ministry.
<p>
The Council elaborates contributions to the formulation of development strategies and objectives. It does not
deal with problems of management or administration. Recently statements were presented on the EU Sugar
Protocol, the role of NGOs, Agriculture, and on Migration (published). The Council will continue its series
of statements on development cooperation in the 1990s. At the time of compiling this survey decisions
proposals for subjects and forthcoming studies were being discussed. A selected number of statements is
published by the Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development in the series 'BMZ Aktuell'. These
are in German. 
<p>
Development cooperation is discussed actively in Parliament and in the Standing Committee on Development
Cooperation as well as in the Budget Committee. 
<p>
<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>
<p>
Project-cooperation with NGOs traditionally has been considerable in Germany. Of the approximately 2000
national and local NGOs about 150 receive financial government support, amounting to a constant 9 per cent
of total German ODA per year. Roughly four broad categories of NGOs can be distinguished: the numerous
Church-related NGOs that have their own, very substantial, fundraising and co-financing agreements with
BMZ for project-implementation; political foundations: NGOs for political education that are affiliated with
the five political parties, and are 100 per cent financed by the Government; 'other NGOs', not-related to
churches or political parties, organised in the 'Bensheimer Kreis' and local NGOs that are active in
advocacy and solidarity activities within Germany. 
<p>
NGOs are organised in several large umbrella organisations. They have a high profile and considerable
influence on the policy debate through their formal and informal contacts with the Government, politicians
and the press. NGOs share a common concern on many issues with BMZ. However, they lobby for more
policy coherence and a stronger government commitment to poverty alleviation. Although policy dialogues
between BMZ and the NGO community have been intensified, there is no formal consultation mechanism.
NGOs advise the Government on the elaboration of new sectoral and country concepts, and on the
development of effective project approaches. 
BMZ carries out frequent and substantial research in cooperation with research institutes. The German
Institute for Development Policy (DIE), funded by BMZ and the City of Berlin, provides expertise on
development policy and trains German postgraduates in the field of development economics. German
(Technical) Universities provide expertise on a wide range of development subjects. According to the 1991
OECD/EADI survey there are 60 Development Research and Training Institutes in (West-) Germany. It is
not know what has been left of the development expertise that existed in the former German Democratic
Republic. 
<p>
Business interests, a.o. organised in a Working Group on Developing Countries chaired by the Federation of
German Industry, consult periodically with the BMZ.

<h3>After the Earth Summit: What is Sustainable Development?<p>EC Aid and Sustainable Development Briefing Paper, No. 1, 1995</h3>



<I>In June 1992, at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the governments of the world adopted Agenda 21, a global action plan for sustainable development. The aim of Agenda 21 is to redirect international cooperation so that it simultaneously tackles the twin problems of worsening poverty and the continuing deterioration of the environment. Following Rio, donor agencies and partners governments in the South have started to examine the implications of the Earth Summit for development policies and programmes. This, the first of two briefing papers looking at development cooperation after the Earth Summit, examines the origins, meaning and operational significance of the sustainable development idea</I>. 
<p>

<H3>From Stockholm to Rio</H3>

Over the past two decades, sustainable development has emerged as the preferred way of dealing with the rapid degradation of the natural environment. The first global meeting on this issue, the U.N. Conference on the Human Environment in 1972, focused mainly on the environmental issues that were most evident in the wealthy nations, and associated with industrial development and a rapid growth in consumption. Much less attention was given to the needs of lower income countries in the South for stronger and more stable economies, as well as environmental improvement. Although the need to combine development and environment goals was becoming evident, more emphasis was placed on the "limits to growth" arising from shortages in resources, particularly non-renewable resources such as metals and fossil fuels. 
<p>
The new concern for what later became labelled "sustainable development" is evident in the Cocoyoc Declaration of 1974, which addressed the issue of how to respect the "inner limit" of satisfying fundamental human needs within the "outer limits" of the Earth’s carrying capacity. It was the World Conservation Strategy produced in 1980 by World Conservation Union (IUCN), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) that then launched sustainable development into the international policy arena, stressing the importance of integrating environmental protection and conservation values into the development process. 
<p>
The World Conservation Strategy led to the production of the first generation of national conservation strategies in both North and South. But it was the 1987 World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), otherwise known as the Brundtland Commission, that produced the now almost universally quoted definition of sustainable development as:
<ul>
"<I>Meeting the needs of the current generation, without undermining the ability of future generations to meet their own needs</I>". 
</ul>
<p>
The fourth ACP-EU Lom&#233; Convention signed in December 1989 incorporated the lessons of the Brundtland Commission, making it perhaps the world’s first sustainable development convention. Article 4 of the fourth Lom&#233; Convention states that "development shall be based on a sustainable balance between its economic objectives, the rational management of the environment and the enhancement of natural and human resources" and a new Title I on Environment spelled out the principles, priorities and procedures for integrating an "environmental reflex" into all other Lom&#233; operations. Analysis of the national and regional indicative programmes for 1990-1995 which account for the bulk of Lom&#233; aid financing shows that the goal of enviromental integration was partially achieved. Only a few included sustainable development as a cross-sectoral issue at the strategic level, although almost all rural development programme incorporated environmental factors. EC spending on projects with a primary environmental focus has also risen to approximately 10% of the total for 1990-1995. 
<p>
The Brundtland Commission paved the way for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), otherwise known as the Earth Summit, which approved a set of five agreements: 
<ul>
<li>Agenda 21, a global plan of action for sustainable development, containing over 100 programme areas, ranging from trade and environment, through agriculture  (see <A HREF="bp8_gb.html">Briefing No. 8</A>) and desertification (See Briefing Nos. <A HREF="bp4_gb.html">4</A> and <A HREF="bp5_gb.html">5</A>) to capacity building and technology transfer. 
<p>
<li>The Rio Declaration of Environment and Development, a statement of  27 key principles to guide the integration of environment and development policies (including the polluter pays, prevention, precautionary and participation principles).
<p>
<li>The Statement of Principles on Forests, the first global consensus on the management, conservation and sustainable development of the world’s forests.
<p>
<li>The Framework Convention on Climate Change, a legally binding agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at levels that will not upset the global climate system (see Briefing Nos. <A HREF="bp6_gb.html">6</A> and  <A HREF="bp9_gb.html">9</A>).
<p>
<li>The Convention on Biological Diversity, a legally-binding agreement to conserve the world’s genetic, species and ecosystem diversity and share the benefits of its use in a fair and equitable way.
</ul><p>
The European Community adopted all five of these agreements, and identified its Fifth Environmental Action Programme as the strategic tool for implementation at the Community level. Sustainable development also became a prominent feature of the Treaty on European Union, in terms of the overall objectives of the Union (Article 2) as well as its environment and development policies (Article 130 r-y). 
<p>
Now that high-level legal and political commitments have been made to sustainable development, it is important to define more closely what the concept means, the implications it has for policy making and how it can be put into practice from the bottom up.

<H3>Implementing the Idea </H3>

The battle to win support for the concept of sustainable development has been effectively won. Decision-makers are now concerning themselves with the business of implementing or operationalising the concept, for example, by preparing policies for sustainable agriculture, directing support at sustainable forestry or developing national sustainability strategies (see <A HREF="bp3_gb.html">Briefing No. 3</A>). 
<p>
But as the Swedish Government noted in its recent report on development assistance after UNCED, "there is no unambiguous definition of the concept of sustainable development". This absence of clear definition has allowed some to claim that they are practising sustainable development, while essentially repackaging ‘business as usual’ approaches. 
<p>
Part of the problem lies in the confusion that surrounds what is actually "sustained" by "sustainable development". Although the term "sustainable" is most widely used to refer to the maintenance of ecological systems and resources, it has also been applied to the economic, social and even cultural spheres.
<p>
This broad application of "sustainability" is perhaps not surprising, since sustainable development is by nature an interdisciplinary concept, drawing on social and physical sciences, as well as law, management and politics. It is also a dynamic approach, which according to the Brundtland Commission is "a process of change in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of investments, the orientation of technological development, and institutional change are all in harmony and enhance both current and future potential to meet human needs and aspirations."
<p>
What the Earth Summit did make clear is that meeting human needs forms the bedrock of sustainable development. Thus, according to the World Health Organisation "the most immediate environmental problems in the world are the ill-health and premature death caused by biological agents in the human environment in water, food, air or soil".  The implications of a commitment to meet the needs of present and future generations are presented in Box 1.

</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
At present, these preconditions are rarely being met. As a result, the world appears to be locked into a number of downward trends which are moving away from, rather than toward, sustainability. The roots of this decline are many, but can be clustered into two broad groups, market failures, where economic transactions fail to take account of social or environmental costs, and policy failures, where governments inadvertently encourage environmental degradation, for example, through subsidising energy and water use. The issue is thus not one of whether governments should intervene to steer development towards sustainability, but how.
 
<H3>Balancing Objectives</H3>

Sustainable development aims to reverse these downward trends. There is a growing consensus that sustainable development means achieving a quality of life that can be maintained for many generations because it is:
<ul>
<li>socially desirable, fulfilling people’s cultural, material and spiritual needs in equitable ways.
<li>economically viable, paying for itself, with costs not exceeding income, and
<li>ecologically sustainable, maintaining the long-term  viability of supporting ecosystems.
</ul><p>
These three objectives define the desired outcomes of the core systems for development, which in turn are influenced by broader boundary conditions, such as peace and security, politics, institutional arrangements and cultural norms (Figure 1). 
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="fig1e.gif"></center>
<p>
The three systems basic to sustainable development -  the ecological,  economic, and the social systems - are highly complex. For sustainable development to be achieved, it is crucial to balance present and future needs, allow for uncertainties in future conditions, and acknowledge local differences in values and circumstances. 
<p>
Hard choices and real trade-offs will have to be negotiated. These negotiations will be greatly influenced by the  prevailing economic interests, cultural norms, political systems and institutional arrangements, which differ from country to country. Traditionally, societies have attempted to set goals for each system, often in isolation from one another. Thus, nature conservation targets have been set without regard to the goals for economic growth or poverty reduction. The result has been the creation of short-lived ‘green islands’ in a sea of unsustainability. Decision-makers are now becoming aware that environmental goals can only be achieved by integrating them into mainstream social and economic policy making.

<H3>Making Trade-offs</H3>

A pragmatic way of tackling the question: "How best to achieve sustainable development?" is to start with the premise that development intrinsically involves trade-offs between potentially opposing goals, such as between economic growth and resource conservation, or between modern technology and indigenous practices. These conflicts are often real, but vary greatly according to circumstance. Poverty is often cited as a cause of environmental degradation, but there are many examples of poor societies living in harmony with their environment. Similarly, it is often stated that population growth in developing countries is inevitably on a collision course with the resource base. However, there are cases where population growth has been associated with better management of resources. Equally, there is no necessary link between economic growth and environmental damage; the policy challenge is to drive a policy wedge between rising incomes and resource use and pollution, a task that has proved hard to realise in practice. 
<p>
The aim of sustainable development is thus to optimise the realisation of a society’s many and different social, environmental and economic objectives at one and the same time. Preferably, this should be achieved through an adaptive process of integration, but more usually it will require bargains (or trade-offs) struck amongst the different interest groups concerned. Critical to this process is the recognition that different perspectives on  environment and development are both inevitable and legitimate. There could be, for example, very different environmental priorities between donors, recipient governments and the poor of developing countries.  
<p>
One way of looking at these trade-offs is to take an economic approach and identify the human and natural capital stocks that are needed for development. Explicit policies are required to maintain and enhance our natural capital and the services it provides for development, such as raw materials, freshwater and a stable climate. Within natural capital, distinctions will need to be made between critical stocks, which are irreplaceable and which should not be traded-off against social and economic goals, and those which can be exchanged in return for building up technological capital, thus maintaining constant levels of overall capital stocks. 

<H3>The Participation Principle</H3>

The question then arises: who should make the decisions on trade-offs?  Here, Agenda 21 calls for the widest possible participation in international negotiations, such as UNCED,  in national strategy-making exercises and in project design and implementation. Participation is crucial not only for the effectiveness and legitimacy of actions, but also because of the relative lack of "scientific" tools and indicators which can give policy makers instant answers. Developing and using consensus-building and conflict resolution techniques will therefore be an important element of sustainable development. New performance indicators are needed, such as improved "rates of change" environmental indicators, as well as ‘barometric’ indicators of progress towards or away from sustainable development.
<p>
National governments are responsible for providing the conditions which both permit and facilitate the necessary dialogue and negotiation between all sectors and interest groups in society. The national strategies for sustainable development called for in Agenda 21 could themselves lead to greater democracy, encourage a overhaul of institutional arrangements, administrative procedures and legislative frameworks, as well as fostering consensus among different strata and groupings in society. Donors can support this country-driven process by coordinating their activities, by not imposing external models and by refocusing existing investments to bring them in line with a partner’s goals for sustainable development.

<H3>EC Action</H3>

For the EC, the recent introduction of the Project Cycle Management approach and the Environment Manual provide the foundations for improving the environmental performance of aid. Environmental protection is a key factor for overall project sustainability within the PCM system, while the Environment Manual shows how the environmental factor can be integrated at each stage of the project cycle from conception to final evaluation.
<p>
Environmental Guidelines to assist the programming of the next phase of Lomé IV (1996-2000) have also been prepared. These incorporate the lessons of Rio for aid management, stressing the importance of both integrating the environment into the design and implementation of all Community activities, and integrating social and economic factors at initiatives aimed specifically at environmental protection. The Guidelines set the core goal of strengthening in-country ACP human, technology and institutional environmental capacities in the public, private and civil sectors (NGOs).

EU Aid
<p>EC Aid and Sustainable Development Briefing Paper, No. 8, 1996</h3>

<I>At the 1992 Earth Summit, the governments of the world adopted the Agenda 21 action plan which contained a set of priority actions for achieving ‘sustainable agriculture and rural development’ in both the developed and developing countries. According to Agenda 21, the overriding objective is to “increase production in a sustainable way and enhance food security”. Development agencies were assigned an important role at Rio to support national and regional efforts in the South, and best practice is beginning to emerge. This briefing outlines the challenge of sustainable agriculture, identifies the core components of successful policies and suggests some ways forward for EU development cooperation</I>. 
<p>
<H3>The Global Food Challenge</H3>

If current trends in domestic production and consumption do not change, global food production will have to double in the next three decades in order to cover the “hidden hunger” of low-income people in developing countries. This increased demand for food can be met by domestic production, imports (including food aid), or both. Food aid (currently 15 MMT of foodstuffs annually) is unlikely to augment domestic supplies appreciably, except to relieve human suffering during natural or human disasters. Imports of foods, mostly grains, have risen rapidly over the past decade and currently account for nine percent of total grain consumption in developing countries. Any rapid and continuing increase of food imports would divert scarce foreign exchange needed to meet other national priorities. Thus, most developing countries will have to continue to provide the bulk of their national food supplies themselves.
<p>
But this expansion of food production must come at a time when natural resources such as land and water are being degraded and converted to non-agricultural purposes, the earth’s pollution-absorptive capacity is being reduced and wastes are accumulating, when non-renewable resources (minerals and fossil fuels) are being consumed at unprecedented rates, and biodiversity and fragile ecosystems are being destroyed by inappropriate use. For these reasons, the solution to the problem lies in producing more food at lower cost on limited amounts of land, and increasing the income and livelihood options of rural producers. Thus, the five critical global agricultural challenges facing the European Union’s development cooperation efforts are to support developing countries to: 
<ul>
i.	Meet the basic nutritional requirements of 700-800 million persons who go hungry today;
<p>
ii.	Provide food at affordable prices for an additional 100 million people every year (the largest annual population increase in recorded history);
<p>
iii.	Increase food production through greater intensification, diversification and productivity per unit of land (as expansion is no longer feasible in most of the world);
<p>
iv.	Create pricing, marketing and distribution mechanisms and policies that ensure that poor people gain; and
<p>
v.	Do all of this in ways that conserve natural resources and biological diversity, and strengthens local livelihoods.
</ul><p>
Can these challenges be met? In theory, yes. There are no major biophysical and technological constraints to achieving the necessary yield gains. In practice, however, there are severe economic, environmental, political and social obstacles.

<H3>Making the Transition</H3>

To prevent food insecurity and reduce poverty in the coming decades, technical solutions alone will not be sufficient. There is now agreement that a new agricultural revolution is required which increases the choices, assets, and power of the rural poor of developing countries. This revolution will be based on an array of strategies which, taken together, are known as Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development or SARD. The rudiments of SARD were described in Agenda 21 and are already being practised and refined by farmers, researchers and development practitioners in many quarters. Their aim is not only to improve agricultural productivity, but to do so in a way that regenerates rural communities and strengthens local livelihoods.  Essentially, this means making better use of locally available resources, through:
<ul>
<li>A more thorough incorporation of natural processes such as nutrient cycles, nitrogen fixation, and pest-predator relationships into the agricultural production process.
<p>

Sustainable agriculture does not mean a return to some form of low technology, ‘backward’ or traditional agricultural practices. Rather, it emphasises the importance of innovation. Also low-input agriculture does not mean low-output agriculture. While the basic ingredients for sustainable agriculture are common, specific requirements differ widely according to region and circumstance, particularly between the Green Revolution (GR) lands and the complex, diverse, risk-prone (CDR) areas.
<p>
Between 2.3-2.6 billion people are supported by agricultural systems characterised by modern technologies of the Green Revolution. Located on the broad irrigated plains and deltas of South, Southeast, and East Asia, parts of North Africa and Latin America, and in smaller patches in other regions, these systems depend on external resources for production, including synthetic nitrogen fertiliser or phosphates, chemical pesticides, and irrigation water from distant sources. Typically, they support monocrop or monoanimal, market-oriented enterprises, including lowland irrigated rice, wheat and cotton; plantations of bananas, pineapples, oil palm and sugar cane; intensive horticulture on urban perimeters; and intensive livestock rearing and ranching. The GR lands cover some 215 million ha and produce approximately 60 percent of the total quantity of grain grown in developing countries.  
<P>
However, the majority of low-income rural dwellers, some 1.9-2.2 billion people, reside in areas that are resource poor, highly heterogeneous and risk prone, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Located in the arid and semi-arid lands, wetlands, uplands, mountains and hillslopes of developing countries, these peoples must rely on internal resources such as rainfall, biologically fixed nitrogen, nutrients from lower soil strata and biological pest control based on natural enemies.  Farming systems in these environments are complex and diverse, and must adapt to periodic water stress, high temperatures and other extreme conditions. Rural livelihood strategies in these CDR areas often depend on wild resources and off-farm employment, as well as agricultural products, since yields are generally low and variable. They are remote from services and roads, and they commonly produce one-fifth to one-tenth as much food per hectare as farms in the GR areas. 
<P>
The basic challenge for SARD in each of these environments is quite different. In the GR lands, it is to maintain yields at current levels while reducing environmental damage and other negative externalities. In the CDR areas, it is to increase yields per unit of production without damaging natural resources or degrading the environment.

<tr><td><center><h4>Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development: Experiences from Africa</h4></center>
<ul>
<li>Generating Surplus Production from Low Potential Ethiopia: The Cheha Integrated Rural Development Project in southwest Ethiopia has achieved a 70% improvement of overall nutrition levels within the project area, along with a 60% improvement of crop yields since 1984, by employing a SARD approach.    An area once reliant on emergency food aid is able 	to feed itself and produce surplus crops for sale at local markets.<li>Participation & Farmer Exchange in Tanzania: The GTZ-funded Soil Erosion Control and Agroforestry Project (SECAP) has promoted sustainable agriculture practices, including agroforestry, manuring, zero grazing, composting, use of legumes, increased crop diversity. Participatory approaches are central, with farmer exchanges and discussions proving an important tool, particularly to motivate change and see how different practices work on real farms.<li>Reforming Extension Services in Kenya: The Soil and Water Conservation Branch of the Ministry of Agriculture, with support from Sida, has pioneered the development of participatory processes for extension staff. With the mobilisation of communities, support to local groups and collaboration with other departments, some 100,000 farms are applying soil and water conservation measures across the country. In many of these areas, food production has been increased and resource degradation reduced.<li>Farmer-Driven Research in Burkina Faso: In the drought-prone region of Yatenga, the Oxfam-assisted Project Agro-Forestier (PAF) has promoted a technology development process that builds on indigenous and external technical knowledge in soil and water conservation and land management for over 17 years.  By supporting a farmer-driven research agenda and SARD approaches to resource management, PAF has helped farmers develop 	low-cost and low-risk technologies that increase 	food production, improve soils and require few 	external inputs.</ul>

</center>
<p>
Empirical evidence indicates that the transition to SARD systems can be achieved in both of these zones, bringing environmental and economic benefits to individual farmers, communities and national governments. In the GR lands, farmers adopting regenerative technologies and integrated farming practices have maintained yields and profitability, while substantially reducing environmental and social costs. In the CDR environments, farmers using SARD approaches have doubled and sometimes trebled yields, often with little or no use of external inputs. This has been accompanied by various indirect social and economic benefits:  
<ul>
<li>There is less need for expansion into non-agricultural areas, thus ensuring that valuable wild resources and environmentally sensitive habitats are not lost;  
<p>
<li>There is reduced contamination and pollution of the environment, thus reducing the costs incurred by farming households, consumers and national economies as a whole.  
<p>
<li>In some places there has been a regeneration of local economies and a strengthened sense of community, which has led to the reversal of rural-urban migration patterns as the demand for agricultural labour grows and off-farm employment opportunities increase.  
</ul><p>
<H3>Core Elements of SARD</H3>

While there is no blueprint for implementing SARD, successful initiatives appear to share five core elements.
<P>
1.	<I>Resource-conserving technologies and integrated farm management practices</I>.  The hallmark of SARD is not the conventional practices it rejects, but the innovative practices it includes, such as nutrient recycling, integrated pest management, soil and water conservation, and multiple cropping.  In contrast to conventional agriculture, SARD systems more deliberately integrate and take advantage of naturally occurring beneficial interactions. These systems emphasise management over technology, and biological relationships and natural processes over chemically intensive methods. The objective is to enhance and manage complexity, rather than reduce and simplify the biophysical interactions on which agricultural production depends, thus reducing the harmful off-farm effects of production practices.  
<P>
2.	<I>Diversified livelihood strategies</I>.  Greater control leads not only to more diverse, stable and resilient livelihood strategies, but also to the generation of more and better off-farm as well as on-farm employment and income opportunities. Thus, both the wider rural economy and individual farming households benefit.
<P>
3.	<I>Collective action of local organisations and intermediaries</I>. Many innovative SARD efforts have been initiated through the collective actions of community-based organisations and non-governmental organisations which have mobilised local resources and instituted a dynamic process of social change. These organisations have designed their own projects and negotiated support directly from the state and donors. They have also attracted interest for their role as political agents who can also help make the state more accountable, especially when groups of these organisations form higher-level coalitions or federations. 
<P>
4.	<I>An enabling policy environment</I>.  Where SARD strategies have had the greatest impact is in those countries with policies that have created the conditions for the transition to more sustainable forms of agriculture and resource management; liberalised markets for agricultural inputs and outputs with major private sector involvement; efficient financial institutions and alternative rural credit and banking systems; adequate rural infrastructure; and effective institutions to develop and disseminate appropriate agricultural technologies and information, and foster farmer-led research and development.  
<P>
5.	<I>Support from external actors</I>.  The transition from unsustainable to more sustainable systems has been promoted and supported by a wide array of external actors, including government agencies, research organisations, and bilateral and multilateral technical and donor agencies, who have treated  local farmers as partners in the development process, rather than as clients, beneficiaries or ‘target groups’. 

<H3>SARD & Development Cooperation</H3>

At a time when the need for sensitive and innovative support for agriculture is becoming pressing, the agricultural sector in development assistance has come under suspicion of poor performance. At the World Bank, a review of over 1000 projects found that agricultural and rural projects performed worse in terms of rates of return than other sectors (particularly urban, transport and infrastructure). IIED’s analysis of 95 agricultural projects logged on the OECD-DAC database shows a disturbing rate of failure, with at least 27% of projects having non-sustainable structures, practices or institutions, and 10% causing significant negative environmental impact. And although the EC has been committed to the principles of sustainable agriculture since the signature of the Fourth Lomé Convention, a 1994 sectoral evaluation of 160 EC-financed rural development projects concluded with a “pessimistic prognosis” regarding environmental performance. 
<P>
What can the EU do to learn from the mistakes of the past and help support the transition toward sustainable agriculture? A starting point is to focus on the livelihood requirements of low-income rural households and then identify appropriate research and development priorities which meet their needs. Particular activities for donor assistance include: 
<ul>
<li><I>Support national policies/strategies for SARD</I>: National agriculture and resource management policies need to be coordinated more effectively, particularly to overcome problems of compartmentalisation of tasks between different ministries. Moreover, these policies must take a broader food systems perspective, rather than a narrow farming systems or food production approach.  This means understanding agriculture’s role in the wider regional economy and creating conditions that support off-farm as well as on-farm employment and income generating activities, the retention of surplus capital and the development of new rural social enterprises.
<p>
<li><I>Promote farmer-centred research and extension</I>: Many research and extension services in developing countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa are under financial pressure. Most are also oriented towards high-input agriculture, with ingrained structures that bias services against sustainable agriculture and participatory development. Donors should now prioritise the SARD agenda, and wherever possible, involve farmers in research design and implementation, as it is they who know local conditions best. Farmer-to-farmer exchanges can also prove effective.
<p>
<li><I>Improve rural infrastructure</I>: Poor marketing, storage, processing and transport infrastructure are often key constraints to the production of agricultural surplus. Investment in physical and social infrastructure is vital but not enough. To be useful, these facilities have to be operated and maintained, which requires a new focus on establishing local revenue raising and monitoring mechanisms to take over once the donors have gone. Sound infrastructure will enable the establishment of better vertical linkages between agricultural production and agroprocessing and marketing activities in the wider economy, thus ensuring that surplus is retained in the countryside and stimulating new social enterprises.
<p>
<li><I>Strengthen local resource management</I>: Diversity is often a key to food security in resource poor lands, but this diversity is under increasing threat. Support should be provided for farmer associations to carry out in situ genetic conservation and breeding (eg through networks, local seed banks and farmer seed exchanges). Donors should also strengthen local  groups which manage wild resource and common property resource areas.  
<p>
<li><I>Provide entitlements for food security</I>: Several recent sustainable agriculture strategies have achieved success by placing as much emphasis on income-generating activities, establishing rural credit and banking schemes and developing rural social enterprises, as on agricultural production and resource management. Support for rural women as producers and facilitators is critical, involving projects that increase their access to productive resources and raise their health and educational status. 
<p>
<li><I>Establish fair and secure tenure</I>: Security of tenure has emerged as a significant factor in determining investments in land improvement. Donors should assist partner countries to design and implement policies which improve security of access to land and other productive resources for peasant producers, particularly women and pastoralists. 
<p>
<li><I>Reinforce farmers’ organisations and users’ groups</I>: The success of sustainable agriculture depends not just on the motivation, skills and knowledge of individual farmers, but on the collective action of membership organisations for farmers and resource users. A growing number are designing, implementing and managing their own projects.</ul>

<I>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed by 155 countries and by the European Community at the Rio Earth Summit in June 1992.  The Convention came into force in March 1994, and commits its signatories from industrialised countries to introduce greenhouse gas emission control strategies at home and also to assist developing countries in their actions through financial aid, technology transfer and capacity strengthening.  The aim of this briefing on climate change is to stimulate reflection and discussion amongst European policymakers regarding the implications of the Framework Convention for aid strategy. How can measures to combat a long-term threat such as climate change be integrated with action on more immediate social, economic and environmental concerns?</I> 
<p>
<H3>Introduction</H3>

The prospect of long-term climate change - global warming - induced by emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane presents a serious threat to the sustainability of development strategies.
<p>
Participants at the International Conference on Climate Change and Sea Level Rise Impacts held in Hanoi, Vietnam, in November 1991 recommended that “consideration of long-term climate change should be an integral part of the formulation of a national strategy for sustainable development.”  This conclusion was based on two important characteristics of the global warming problem.
<p>
<ul>
<li>First, the consequences of long-term climate change could have substantial implications for a country's development prospects. Sea level rise, for example, may threaten the very survival of certain small island states.
<p>
<li>Second, the continuing growth in greenhouse gas emissions is the result of the increasing use of energy from fossil fuels, the intensification of industry and the expansion of agriculture - the process of development. 
</ul><p>
Any attempt to limit the scale of the global warming problem must, therefore, address the nature of the development process. For this reason, those responsible for aid policy and its implementation have a pivotal role to play.
<p>
The European Union played a major part in the development of the Framework Convention on Climate Change. It is currently pressing for more effective emission control targets and is leading the debate in a number of other areas with regard to implementation. The Framework Convention requires that the industrialized nations assist developing nations meet their obligations under the treaty through the transfer of financial resources and technology as well as through capacity strengthening.
<p>
The assistance given to developing nations by the European Union - the world’s largest aid donor with its member states - will shape the future contribution of the South to resolve the problem. It will also determine the ability of the most vulnerable nations, such as small island states, to cope with adverse consequences. 
<p>
The challenge is to ensure that action to limit the impact of long-term climate change is consistent with the broader goal of sustainable development.

<H3>The Framework Convention on Climate Change</H3>

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme in 1988 in response to international concern about the possibility of global warming. 
<p>
The first goal of the IPCC was to review scientific understanding of the greenhouse problem and assess the seriousness of the threat. The IPCC concluded that, at this time, the scientific evidence is sufficient to warrant precautionary action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and to anticipate potential impacts. 
<p>
As a result, an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee was established to draft a climate treaty. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was eventually agreed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 and came into force in March 1994.
<p>
Individual nations, or regional groupings such as the European Union, who are party to the Framework Convention commit to the overall goal of “stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.”  Stabilization should be achieved within a time frame sufficient “... to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.”
<p>
Alongside emission control, the Convention requires action to anticipate and minimize the worst consequences of climate change and sea level rise and stresses the importance of education, training and capacity strengthening in underpinning the international response to this long-term problem. The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee continues to meet, providing a forum for decision making with respect to implementing the Framework Convention. Progress was reviewed at the First Conference of the Parties in Berlin (28 March - 7 April 1995).

<p>
<H3>Who is responsible for global warming?</H3>

There is no argument that the primary responsibility for global warming lies with the industrialized nations. Over the period since 1870, the developing world has been responsible for no more than 15% of total carbon emissions. Today, the industrialized nations, with only a quarter of the world’s population, are directly responsible for well over one half the greenhouse gas emissions giving rise to global warming. 
<p>
But the situation may be different in fifty years time. The contribution of the developing nations may well exceed that of the industrialized nations by the middle of the 21st century as a result of economic development and population growth. Even then, though the contribution per head of population will remain well below that of the North.  These characteristics, of past and potential responsibility, have led to a commitment on the part of the industrialized nations to financial aid and technology transfer so that developing nations are better able to limit their future contribution to the problem. 

<H3>Who is most vulnerable?</H3>

Nations also differ in their vulnerability to climate change and sea-level rise. Vulnerability depends on the scale of the environmental change a nation faces, the particular circumstances of that nation and the resources that are available to support coping strategies.
<p>
Sea level rise represents a very direct threat to the three-quarters of the world’s population living in low-lying areas close to the coast. Many major cities, port facilities and industries and much fertile agricultural land are located in coastal zones so any impact will have widespread social and economic repercussions.
<p>
President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom of the Maldives was one of the first political leaders to alert the international community to the potential threat of climate change. He has stressed again and again that, unless action is taken to curb global warming, his nation could literally disappear beneath the waves.
<p>
The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) was created in order to represent the interests of these vulnerable nations in the Framework Convention negotiations. AOSIS has played an important role, highlighting the unique circumstances of small island states and emphasising the responsibility of the industrialized world. The group has proposed an innovative “insurance pool” to compensate vulnerable nations for the adverse effects of sea level rise and has recently developed a draft protocol with contains strengthened targets for the developed nations.

<H3>Commitments under the Framework Convention</H3>

The Convention states that it would be desirable for the industrialized nations to stabilize emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. This would show that “developed nations are taking the lead in modifying longer-term trends... consistent with the objective of the Convention.” 
<p>
Stabilization of emissions by the year 2000 is, in effect, a gesture of good faith which is needed to ensure that, at a later stage, the developing nations commit to limiting the future growth in their emissions.  The irony is that stabilization of carbon emissions by the major industrialized nations is not too different from what is likely to happen anyway even if no concerted action is taken to control emissions. 
<p>
For this reason, there is pressure to adopt a more stringent target. The draft protocol developed by AOSIS, for example, requires industrialized nations to reduce their emissions to at least 20% below 1990 levels by the year 2005. This issue will be discussed at the First Conference of the Parties.
<p>
It seems unlikely that control targets will be set for developing nations in the near future. Developing nations are, however, obliged to develop and publish - if not implement - national plans containing measures to limit emission growth. National emission inventories are required to achieve this end.  In common with the other Parties, developing nations must also: 
<ul>
<li>cooperate in the development, application and transfer of technologies that limit emissions;
<li>promote the sustainable management of sinks and reservoirs (forests, oceans, and so on);
<li>cooperate in preparing their adaptation to the impact of climate change and the protection and rehabilitation of areas affected by drought and desertification;
<li>undertake environmental impact assessment of policies and projects which may affect climate change;
<li>promote and cooperate in scientific, technical and other research, in full and open exchange of relevant information; and in education, training and public awareness.
</ul><p>
Various initiatives have been established by relevant United Nations agencies and other bodies to support the involvement of developing nations in this process. It remains to be seen whether they will be sufficient to ensure an effective southern response.
<p>
<center>
<table border=1 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><center><h4>How Certain is the Science?</h4></center>
The greenhouse effect itself is a well-established physical process.   Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide permit energy from the Sun to pass down through the atmosphere unhindered but trap heat near the Earth’s surface. Without the greenhouse gases that occur naturally in the atmosphere, the Earth would be some 30°C colder. Concern about climate change is based on three major findings.<p>First, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has risen dramatically over the past three centuries and human activity is the prime cause.<p>Second, the temperature of the planet has risen by 0.5°C over the past 100 years and this warming is consistent with the predictions of climate models based on the change in atmospheric composition.<p>Third, climate theory, supported by computer model projections, predicts an unprecedented rise in global temperature and sea level over coming decades, with substantial impacts on human welfare.<p>There is, however, a limit to how far scientists can go in predicting the detailed impact of global warming at this time. Scientific uncertainty is an important characteristic of the global warming problem.The fact that definite forecasts cannot be made at present limits the response options currently available. Which is why precautionary action is recommended while scientific understanding is improved.
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
<H3>Who will pay?</H3>

The issue of financial support has been a crucial one during the climate treaty negotiations. The position of many Southern negotiators has been that they will not commit themselves to measures to limit global warming unless the industrialized world covers the additional cost. 
<P>
In principle, at least, this position has been accepted and a financial mechanism has been established to cover the additional costs of appropriate measures. The climate fund is being administered, on a continuing interim basis, by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).
<P>
Current climate projects funded through the GEF include: wind power in Costa Rica; geothermal energy in the Philippines; photovoltaics for community use in Zimbabwe; end-use efficiency improvement in Mexico; land rehabilitation in Benin and Sudan; and gas pipeline replacement in China. The Convention obliges the industrialized nations to support the response of developing nations: 
<ul>
<li>through “new and additional” finance to enable the developing nations to meet their obligations under the Convention;
<li>through assistance to developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in meeting costs of adaptation; and,
<li>by taking all practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies and expertise.
</ul><p>
The Convention stresses the importance of cooperation between nations in tackling the problem of climate change. As the cost-effectiveness of emission reduction varies between nations, it has been proposed that northern nations can gain credit for emission reductions by financing control measures in the developing world (or in other developed nations).
<P>
The process is known as joint implementation and it has raised critical questions regarding responsibility, equity and accountability. It seems likely that a pilot joint implementation phase will be adopted in the near future.
<P>
Criteria for joint implementation schemes adopted during the pilot phase will be discussed at the First Conference of the Parties. It is considered essential that clear criteria are adopted and that effective monitoring and evaluation takes place.

<H3>Confronting the challenge</H3>

The aid community has a vital role to play in ensuring effective implementation of the Framework Convention. The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee has recognized that funding available through the GEF to support implementation of the Framework Convention - about two billion US dollars over the next three years - is dwarfed by the flow of funds through the world’s development agencies.  Development agencies are currently being asked to report on aspects of their portfolio relevant to the climate issue as a first step towards ensuring consistency with the requirements of the Framework Convention.
<P>
To date, few, if any, development agencies have incorporated measures related to global warming into their strategic thinking on sustainable development. Indeed, the possibility of climate change has been considered of minor importance in comparison to other environmental concerns.
<P>
This situation is hardly surprising as the climate issue has only recently been placed on the international agenda. Moreover, the long-term threat of global warming raises difficult questions regarding priorities in circumstances where resources are limited. And just what does precautionary action mean in the context of coping with climate change?
<P>
There are no easy answers. One emerging strand of thought suggests that the best way forward is to tackle the apparent conflict between short-term development priorities and long-term climate protection by “integrating the climate dimension” rather than considering climate change as an issue in isolation.
<P>
In coping with climate change, integrating the climate dimension means identifying areas of vulnerability to climate change or sea level rise caused by present-day social, economic or environmental problems and focusing action on reducing that vulnerability. This win-win approach will have immediate benefits as well as limiting the threat posed by global warming.
<P>
This approach also provides the opportunity to examine the sustainability of present-day development strategies in the harsh light thrown by the long-term perspective of climate change.  Further briefing papers in this series will examine what this approach means in practice.

<P>
La comparaci&oacute;n entre el Documento de seguimiento de las
realizaciones de la Cooperaci&oacute;n Internacional espa&ntilde;ola
durante 1994 con las previsiones, arroja un saldo ligeramente
negativo del 0,40%. Aunque en t&eacute;rminos absolutos este d&eacute;ficit
no se refleja en las cantidades destinadas a AOD, que presentan
un incremento del 3,64% (Cuadro 1), s&iacute; se produce una depreciaci&oacute;n
en t&eacute;rminos relativos, ya que se pasa de un porcentaje
del 0,28% del PIB en 1993 a un 0,27% en el 94. 
<P>
Los recortes se concentran en la Cooperaci&oacute;n Multilateral,
especialmente en los Organismos Internacionales financieros y
no financieros que, por su bajo componente de AOD, tienen menor
incidencia en el descenso final de &eacute;sta. Incluso, se observa
un aumento de la proporcion de AOD que representan las Contribuciones
a Organismos Internacionales no financieros, que pasan de un 2,27%
en 1993 a un 4,81% en 1994 (Cuadro 2). Dentro de este apartado
siguen en aumento los gastos destinados a las Operaciones de Mantenimiento
de la Paz de la ONU. (Cuadro 4). En cambio, la reducci&oacute;n
sobre la aportaci&oacute;n prevista a la UE no supone una disminuci&oacute;n
de su porcentaje del total de AOD, a causa de que el aumento programado
fue demasiado elevado.
<P>
En el apartado bilateral, una vez m&aacute;s, la Ayuda Alimentaria
fue sacrificada en favor de las eventualidades dictadas por las
situaciones de Emergencia que se fueron presentando, aunque los
niveles de ambas son pr&aacute;cticamente insignificantes sobre
el total de la AOD bilateral.
<P>
En el campo de la distribuci&oacute;n geogr&aacute;fica (Cuadro
5) se mantiene una estructura similar a la prevista, aunque se
observa el inicio de la tendencia al descenso de la parte de AOD
destinada a Am&eacute;rica Latina, a pesar de que pa&iacute;ses
como Argentina, M&eacute;xico, Ecuador o Uruguay contin&uacute;an
siendo importantes receptores en base a la partida de cr&eacute;ditos
FAD que se les destina, la &uacute;ltima que les podr&aacute;
ser atribuida seg&uacute;n los criterios de la OCDE aprobados
en Helsinki en 1991. En cambio se consolidan China y el Norte
de &Aacute;frica como principales receptores de ese tipo de ayuda,
mientras sube la proporci&oacute;n de ayuda bilateral no reembolsable
destinada al &Aacute;frica Subsahariana.
<P>
El documento del Seguimiento del PACI s&oacute;lo recoge la Cooperaci&oacute;n
Descentralizada realizada por las Comunidades Aut&oacute;nomas
que, aunque disminuye respecto a las previsiones, sube en un 1%
respecto al gasto realizado por &eacute;stas en 1993. El Gobierno
vasco con un 30% del total y Navarra con el 16,3% se mantienen
como los dos primeros donantes (Cuadro 7), aunque disminuyen su
proporci&oacute;n relativa por el incremento de otras Comunidades
como Andaluc&iacute;a, Arag&oacute;n o Valencia.
<P>
Algunos Gobiernos auton&oacute;micos como Andaluc&iacute;a, Asturias,
Catalu&ntilde;a, Galicia, Madrid y Valencia firmaron convenios
de colaboraci&oacute;n con organismos de Cooperaci&oacute;n de
la Administraci&oacute;n Central, inici&aacute;ndose as&iacute;
una pr&aacute;ctica de coordinaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s sistem&aacute;tica;
pero la gran mayor&iacute;a de los fondos se destinan a los programas
de subvenciones a proyectos ejecutados por ONGD. En este terreno
se observa una marcada preferencia por Am&eacute;rica Latina que
recibe el 65% del total, a mucha distancia del &Aacute;frica Subsahariana
que es la segunda &aacute;rea receptora(Cuadro 8).
<P>
La informaci&oacute;n que se dispone sobre la Cooperaci&oacute;n
realizada por las Corporaciones Locales (Cuadro 9) todav&iacute;a
resulta dif&iacute;cil de evaluar por las dificultades de la recogida
de datos dado, que muchas entidades no tienen presupuestos fijos.
A&uacute;n as&iacute;, de los datos que se desprenden de la encuesta
realizada por la Federaci&oacute;n de Municipios y Provincias,
Andaluc&iacute;a, Catalu&ntilde;a, Pa&iacute;s Vasco y Valencia
siguen apareciendo como las Comunidades con un mayor n&uacute;mero
de entidades que destinan regularmente cantidades de los fondos
municipales a la Cooperaci&oacute;n. La mayor&iacute;a de ellos
realizan sus aportaciones a proyectos realizados por ONGD vinculadas
a su municipio, aunque otras hacen sus aportaciones a los Fondos
Municipales de Desarrollo, que est&aacute;n experimentando una
evoluci&oacute;n positiva y pueden contribuir a estabilizar el
flujo de recursos, permitiendo una mayor planificaci&oacute;n.

The approximately 250 development NGOs, personnel assistance organisations, solidarity
committees, and studygroups are based on Belgium's missionary tradition, former colonial
relations, the international solidarity movements and international university cooperation
groups. NGOs are actively involved in discussions and studies on development cooperation,
in implementation and lobbying. They have good relationships with the political and other
sectors of society. Project implementation is done through their partner organisations in
developing countries, either on their own funds or co-funded by the Government. To be
eligible for funding from the co-funding programme of AGCD, NGOs need to be formally
recognised by the Government. However, bilateral aid through NGOs is limited to emergency
aid. The management and funding of certain NGO-activities has been delegated to the
Regional Governments, for instance the Netherlands and French language teaching
activities. The Government has announced to step up implementation of projects through
NGOs. Structural contacts between government and the NGOs have been established,
amongst others through the installation of three Advisory Commissions in 1991. In 1993 a
Round Table of NGO and Government representatives discussed debt relief issues.
Cooperation with employer's organisations and trade unions have already been mentioned.
Topics for discussions with the Government are amongst others: actuality of information,
stated policy objectives and realisation, commercialisation of development cooperation and
the increase of Government cooperation with NGOs.
<p>
According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey 22 institutes in Belgium qualify as Development
Research and Training Institutes. Some of the best known are: the Institut de M&#233;decine
tropicale Prince L&#233;opold, the International Institute of Administrative Sciences, and the many
faculties and institutes at the universities of Antwerp, Ghent and Louvain. They publish
numerous reports and studies on specific development issues and do consultancy services
for AGCD. Several universities are involved in training programmes for foreign students and
education projects. NGOs execute extensive programmes for development education, partly
government funded.
<p>
There are two university based umbrella organisations that have a Committee for
Development Cooperation. The Committees include representatives of universities, of the
AGCD and the Minister of Development Cooperation. The organisation in the French
speaking region is the CIUF (the Francophone Interuniversity Council) and in the Flemish
speaking region the VLIR (the Flemish Interuniversity Council). Although the details of their
specific mandates are not quite clear, the activities of both Committees may contribute to the
policy debate on development cooperation. Both organisations conduct research for
developing countries and developing projects, as well as on development policy and
cooperation management.
<p>
Over the years more informal groups have played an influential but temporary role in the
development debate, such as the Association for the Study of International Division of
Income and Employment, which formulated rural development as one of the first priorities
for Belgian development cooperation.

<I>La Convention internationale de lutte contre la désertification (CLD) a établi un ordre-du-jour impressionnant pour l’action à mener par les pays en développement et les organismes donateurs. Cette deuxième Note d’Information consacrée à la convention envisage ce qu’elle pourrait signifier sur le terrain et relève quelques leçons du passé, tirées de projets de conservation des sols et de l’eau</I>. 
<p>
<H3>Mise en vigueur de la Convention</H3>

La CLD comporte un certain nombre de thèmes fondamentaux pour le traitement du problème croissant que pose aux pays en développement la dégradation des zones arides. Comme l’indique son texte, on s’attachera:
<ul>
<li>à parvenir à une participation réelle tant des femmes que des hommes, au plan local, national et régional, y compris les cultivateurs, les pastoralistes et leurs organisations représentatives, à la planification des politiques adoptées, aux prises de décision ainsi qu’à la mise en application et à la révision des programmes d’action nationaux;
<p>
<li>à adopter une meilleure souplesse dans la conception des projets, dans leur financement et leur mise en application, conformément à l’approche expérimentale et itérative requise pour l’action participative au plan des communautés locales;
<p>
<li>à encourager une politique de décentralisation active ainsi que l’assomption des responsabilités par les communautés locales; et
<p>
<li>à ajuster le cadre institutionnel et réglementaire de la gestion des ressources naturelles afin d’apporter aux populations locales la sécurité dans leur tenure.
</ul><p>
La tâche à laquelle sont maintenant confrontés les pays en développement et les donateurs consiste à traduire en action toutes ces aspirations. Les salles de conférence des Nations unies sont loin, très loin de la poussière brûlante du champ d’un paysan sahélien. Ces engagements pris par les délégués gouvernementaux déboucheront-ils sur de vrais changements au ras du sol? Et que pouvons-nous faire pour tenter d’y parvenir?
<p>
Nous abordons ici 12 des plus importantes questions auxquelles il faut répondre.
<p>
<H3>1. Quelle est la signification réelle de la désertification?</H3>

Pour beaucoup de gens, la désertification est synonyme d’avancée du désert. Or ce n’est là qu’une petite partie du problème. La menace la plus forte pesant sur les moyens d’existence des cultivateurs et pastoralistes des pays en développement tient à la dégradation de terres souvent situées à des centaines de kilomètres du moindre désert. En conséquence, les vraies mesures de lutte contre la désertification sont celles qui améliorent la stabilité et la productivité des systèmes culturaux et pastoraux des zones arides, dans un contexte de grande variabilité climatique, économique et institutionnelle. Cela implique qu’on agisse pour conserver les ressources en sols et en eau, pour améliorer la fertilité des terres et pour élaborer de meilleures pratiques de gestion des pâtures.

<H3>2. Qu’y-a-t-il de nouveau dans cette Convention?</H3>

La Convention représente l’aboutissement de réflexions et de pratiques remontant à bien des années. Toute cette expérience a montré que les cultivateurs ont besoin d’exercer sur leur terres des droits de tenure mieux sûrs et qu’il est sensé d’impliquer les populations locales dans la planification des projets. Il est aussi évident qu’il arrive aux donateurs d’agir de manière compétitive sans coordination, proposant des initiatives et des plans rivaux à différents ministères. Ce que fait la Convention consiste à regrouper, sous forme cohérente, ces leçons de l’expérience, proposant des principes d’orientation clairs, qui reposent sur des approches plus prometteuses de la gestion des zones arides.

<H3>3. Quelle est l’ampleur du calendrier dont nous disposons pour travailler?</H3>

La Convention de lutte contre la désertification a fait l’objet d’un accord en juin 1994 et plus d’une centaine de gouvernements l’ont signée depuis. Presque tous les gouvernements africains sont parmi les signataires, avec 13 des 15 membres de l’Union Européenne, sans compter la Commission Européenne elle-même. Mais elle n’entrera pas en vigueur avant 1997, car il faut du temps pour que sa ratification soit obtenue auprès des parlements d’au moins 50 pays. Néanmoins, suite à l’accord dont a fait l’objet la Résolution sur les mesures à prendre d’urgence pour l’Afrique, des activités pilotes sont d’ores et déjà en cours, le Mali ayant en ce domaine pris la tête du peloton africain.

<H3>4. Comment une convention peut-elle faire la moindre différence du point de vue des cultivateurs et éleveurs des zones arides?</H3>

Elle n’y parviendra que si les gouvernements concernés décident de la prendre au sérieux. Si on s’en tient à l’aspect formel des choses, une convention internationale entraîne des obligations juridiques pour les États qui l’ont signée. En pratique, toute convention ne connaît pas nécessairement, de la part des gouvernements signataires, une stricte application. Étant réaliste, la Convention ne va pas changer du jour au lendemain la situation de millions d’usufruitiers des zones arides africaines.
<p>
Cependant, on constate qu’un nombre suffisant de pays concernés et de gouvernements donateurs ont exprimé leur volonté de l’appuyer réellement, ce qui nous donne une bonne base de départ, composée d’engagements fermes qui pourront avantager de manière substantielle les utilisateurs ordinaires des terres dans tout le continent.

<H3>5. Pourquoi la Convention serait-elle respectée par quiconque, surtout si elle ne comporte aucun objectif obligatoire et aucune modalité supplémentaire de financement?</H3>

Il est vrai qu’aucune somme supplémentaire n’est promise par la Convention, à la différence de la Convention sur le changement climatique ou de celle sur la diversité biologique, où un financement est prévu grâce au Fonds pour l’Environnement Mondial. Mais la désertification est un problème d’ordre plutôt différent, à tel point que de nombreux observateurs pensaient que négocier un instrument de ce type n’était pas la bonne manière d’aborder ce genre de question. En fait, cette nouvelle convention représente pour l’essentiel un «code de bonne conduite» pour les gouvernements bénéficiaires et les donateurs. Son texte exprime le désir des signataires d’adopter certains principes d’orientation, quant au cadre politique idoine pour encourager une gestion plus durable des zones arides et pour les modalités d’application de l’aide.
<p>
Les griffes d’un code de bonne conduite ne sont ni nombreuses ni très acérées car il dépend surtout de l’intérêt des gens à agir mieux et à être perçus comme tels par autrui. Le désir de donner aux autres le bon exemple peut être une incitation puissante à élaborer des stratégies et des méthodes de travail nouvelles. Par ailleurs, les gouvernements signataires des pays affectés qui négligeraient d’appliquer les principes établis par la Convention risqueraient d’avoir des difficultés croissantes à persuader les donateurs de l’OCDE de débourser des fonds d’aide. Dans tous les pays développés, les sommes disponibles à ce titre tendent à se réduire et il est probable que priorité sera donnée aux bénéficiaires pouvant démontrer leur volonté de traduire en actes les engagements auxquels ils ont apposé leur signature.

<H3>6. Qu’ont donc promis de faire les gouvernements africains?</H3>

Bien des choses, dont le réexamen des politiques menées dans des domaines comme les modes de tenure foncière et d’administration, dans la perspective d’un transfert du pouvoir s’exerçant sur la terre, de l’État aux communautés locales et à leurs institutions. Les gouvernements ont promis de donner un style bien plus participatif à leurs prises de décision et à la planification de leurs activités, qu’ils devront intégrer, en compagnie d’autres actions, à un programme national d’action pour lutter contre la désertification.

<H3>7. Encore un programme d’action pour l’environnement! À quoi bon?</H3>

Pendant les années 80, de nombreux pays en développement ont établi des plans d’action forestière tropicale, des plans nationaux d’action pour l’environnement et des stratégies nationales de conservation. D’aucuns craignent que la CLD ajoute à cette surcharge planificatrice. Or, ces programmes nationaux d’action ne sont pas prévus pour remplacer des stratégies existantes mais pour assurer, le cas échéant, qu’on se concentre spécifiquement sur les problèmes de gestion des zones arides. Ils ne sont pas censés être des documents formels donnant la liste de tous les projets pour lesquels les gouvernements cherchent des fonds. Il faut plutôt que ces programmes nationaux d’action orientent l’attention vers toute une série de changements de politiques, de réformes institutionnelles et de projets plus vastes qu’il faut entreprendre pour s’assurer que les utilisateurs des terres soient mieux incités à investir dans leur terre.

<H3>8. Et quels engagements les donateurs doivent-ils assumer?</H3>

Il est admis sans ambiguïté que la responsabilité première, en matière d’amélioration de la gestion des ressources des zones arides, revient aux pays affectés. Les donateurs doivent apporter leur soutien aux efforts de ces pays en mettant des fonds à long terme à la disposition des programmes d’action nationaux et en assurant que ces fonds soient attribués de manière plus souple. Les donateurs ont aussi accepté de s’efforcer de coordonner leurs activités avec plus d’efficacité afin d’éviter les contradictions entre leurs approches.

<H3>9. De quelle façon pourra-t-on intégrer cet engagement à une participation et une décentralisation plus poussées, dans l’élaboration des projets, à la programmation des donateurs?</H3>

Il s’agit là d’une des questions les plus urgentes que les donateurs, tels que l’U.E., se doivent de résoudre. À court terme, il leur faut identifier les options (dont beaucoup sont déjà disponibles) permettant d’améliorer la flexibilité et la participation au sein des procédures existantes. Leur tâche consiste à diffuser les expériences de réussite au niveau national.

<H3>10. Quels sont, au niveau des politiques nationales, les préalables d’une application réussie de la CLD?</H3>

Il faut que les gouvernements nationaux mettent en place un cadre sûr, au sein duquel les cultivateurs et les éleveurs aient un véritable intérêt à améliorer leurs terres. Il faut que les principaux acteurs soient les cultivateurs et les éleveurs locaux eux-mêmes. Il ne faut pas que les gouvernements et les donateurs pensent que leur tâche consiste à se mêler de tout et à dire aux gens ce qu’ils doivent faire.
<p>
Les droits de gestion des ressources doivent faire l’objet d’une définition bien claire, afin que les éleveurs aient intérêt à gérer les pâtures au profit du long terme. Il ne sert à rien qu’ils mettent sur pied des systèmes de mise en réserve de pâturages si d’autres peuvent venir d’ailleurs et exploiter ces ressources. De même, il faut que les villageois se sentent en sécurité quant à leurs droits de gestion des bois et des pacages, sûrs que ces droits seront protégés si des gens venus d’ailleurs essaient d’y faire du charbon de bois ou de s’y installer et de commencer à défricher la terre sans l’accord de la population locale.

<H3>11. Que peut-on faire au plan local?</H3>

Il y a différentes possibilités. L’une d’elles consiste à réviser les codes fonciers afin de s’assurer que l’attribution de la responsabilité de gestion des terres au plan local s’accompagne de droits commensurables, garantissant aux populations concernées la possibilité de choisir qui aura accès aux ressources, et à quelles conditions. Une autre innovation importante, qui fait des progrès dans certains pays sahéliens, est la rédaction de «conventions locales», qui passent par le regroupement de 5 à 10 villages ayant des ressources communes. Ces conventions précisent les conditions permettant aux villageois de couper du bois, de défricher des terres et d’accéder aux pâturages dans les limites de la zone d’ensemble. Simultanément, ces conventions locales décident des indemnités que devront payer les étrangers désireux de venir couper du bois ou faire paître leurs animaux sur le territoire commun de ce groupe de villages. Ce qui est très important est le fait que l’administration locale veuille bien, désormais, admettre que de telles conventions représentent une base légale pour le soutien des droits des villageois.

<H3>12. Quelles sont les implications pratiques de la participation populaire?</H3>

Il y en a plusieurs. Il s’agit, en premier lieu, d’un engagement à travailler avec moins de précipitation et à impliquer les populations locales et leurs organisations dans la discussion, dès le début, des activités envisagées, quelles qu’elles soient, en prêtant attention à leurs idées et en prenant comme pierre angulaire leur savoir et leurs aptitudes. En second lieu, cette participation passe par un investissement en ressources et en temps dans la formation  - celle des autochtones comme celle du personnel des projets, des gouvernements et des donateurs - aux méthodes participatives de planification au niveau communautaire. On dispose d’un certain nombre de techniques participatives et d’un nombre croissant de formateurs compétents en ce domaine. En troisième lieu, il s’agit d’un engagement à investir dans la création et le développement de la capacité des populations et organisations locales  - ce qui se fait par le développement de l’alphabétisation et de la connaissance du calcul, par l’accès au crédit, par le transfert du pouvoir foncier, et ainsi de suite - afin qu’elles puissent se charger des décisions qui les affectent.

<H3>Les Leçons de la Conservation des Sols et de l’Eau</H3>

Partant des leçons tirées du passé, la convention offre une perspective très prometteuse pour le progrès de tous ceux et celles qui se préoccupent des secteurs les plus pauvres du globe, ainsi qu’une manière d’assurer l’application plus efficace de l’aide au développement. Elle se concentre sur les initiatives à base communautaire et fournit des orientations pratiques pour la planification et la conception des projets.
<P>
Certes, les zones arides de la planètes sont confrontées à des problèmes tout particuliers. Elles n’en disposent pas moins d’un potentiel considérable, pour autant qu’il soit correctement géré. Nous disposons de nombreux exemples de réussites en matière de conservation des sols et de l’eau, de cas où tout s’est bien déroulé. La Convention offre des principes de base permettant d’assurer que nous ayons de meilleures chances de succès et que nous disposions d’un programme d’aide dont nous puissions être fiers.
<P>
Dans le passé, nombre de projets de conservation des sols et de l’eau (CSE) ont connu l’échec parce qu’ils faisaient appel à des techniques inacceptables aux yeux des utilisateurs des terres, inadéquates même au plan technique et nécessitant souvent un entretien excessif. Pendant l’ère coloniale, on obligeait les gens de force à construire des ouvrages de conservation et après l’indépendance on les a soudoyés dans le même but, à l’aide d’un usage systématique de «nourriture pour du travail». Quand les projets ont systématiquement fait appel à une mécanisation lourde pour ériger les ouvrages de conservation, les «bénéficiaires» ont eu tendance à estimer que puisque ces ouvrages étaient construits par l’administration, c’est à celle-ci qu’il revenait aussi de les entretenir. On a toujours volontiers dispensé des instructions aux utilisateurs des terres, mais ils n’ont jamais été consultés au sujet de ce qui pouvait être fait pour inverser le processus de dégradation de ces terres. Et dans les circonstances où ils avaient eux-mêmes imaginé toute une gamme de techniques, celles-ci ont été, d’habitude, totalement ignorées ou simplement délaissées.
<P>
Mais quand les ouvrages de conservation (terrasses, diguettes, digues de contrôle, drains de rupture, etc ...) ne sont pas bien conçus et entretenus, il ne leur faut que quelques années pour s’effondrer, en suite de quoi ils accélèrent le rythme de l’érosion plutôt que de le diminuer. Or l’absence d’une maintenance adéquate a été la règle et non l’exception.
<P>
Les organismes donateurs ont persisté à financer des projets de CSE aux mauvaises performances, en partie parce que ces projets n’ont jamais été l’objet d’un contrôle adéquat. Les coûts n’ont pas été évalués en regard d’avantages réels. Alors que la plupart des projets de CSE comportaient une évaluation du coût de l’ensemble technique qu’ils promouvaient, ils n’étaient souvent animés que d’une bien vague notion des avantages qu’ils allaient engendrer. Il n’était pas rare que l’on tienne pour réussis certains projets tout simplement parce qu’on faisait chaque année la somme des hectares traités et qu’on pouvait ainsi faire étalage de chiffres impressionnants. Mais on ne soustrayait jamais le nombre des hectares traités mais non exploités par les «bénéficiaires», ni celui des hectares où les ouvrages de conservation cessaient d’être exploitables après 3 ou 4 ans. Et enfin, on s’est rendu compte que dans presque tous les cas les activités de CSE s’interrompent dès que le financement du donateur est supprimé.
<P>
Depuis le milieu des années 80, les conceptions relatives aux méthodes à appliquer en CSE ont évolué sous l’influence des progrès réalisés dans des pays comme le Burkina Faso. Pendant plus de dix ans, dans le plateau central de ce pays, des diguettes de terre avaient été érigées, mais on ne les avait ni entretenues, ni étendues. Un projet d’agro-foresterie financé par Oxfam à Yatenga avait commencé, en 1979, la mise à l’épreuve de diguettes en pierres épousant les contours du terrain - essentiellement une technique traditionnelle améliorée. Les agriculteurs réagirent avec enthousiasme à cette initiative et un programme de formation au niveau du village fut alors lancé pour les former aux principes de la construction de diguettes en pierres. Nombreux furent ceux qui érigèrent spontanément dans leurs propres champs des diguettes de ce type.

<H3>Des techniques simples et efficaces</H3>

La leçon retenue de cette expérience fut que les techniques de conservation devaient - doivent - être simples, peu coûteuses, efficaces et n’exiger qu’un entretien minimum, si l’on veut que les utilisateurs des terres les acceptent. Pour la première fois, la possibilité d’une reproduction aisée fut identifiée comme critère important dans la conception des projets de CSE. Tant que la majorité des utilisateurs de terres ne prennent pas l’initiative d’activités de CSE dans leurs propres champs, la bataille contre la dégradation des terres ne peut être gagnée. Dans le Sahel ouest-africain, on rencontre une menue palette de techniques de gestion des ressources naturelles, spontanément adoptées par les utilisateurs des terres. Ce sont:
<ul>
<li>les diguettes de pierre épousant les contours du terrain
<li>les fosses de plantation améliorées (zay ou tassa)
<li>les demi-lunes
<li>le paillage
<li>les fosses à compost
<li>régénération naturelle assistée
<p></ul>
Depuis le début des années 80, le Sahel a connu de grandes percées techniques. Au Burkina Faso, au Niger et au Mali, des milliers d’hectares de terres dégradées sont désormais réhabilités chaque année, grâce aux expériences menées sur le terrain par les équipes des projets et les cultivateurs (voir encadré ci-dessous).
<p>

<table border=1 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><center><h4>Étude de cas: amélioration de fosses de plantation au Niger</h4></center>
Depuis 1987, le FIDA (Fond international de développement agricole) finance un projet de CSE dans le district d’Illéla au Niger, afin de promouvoir des techniques de CSE simples et peu coûteuse, faciles à maîtriser par les utilisateurs des terres. En 1989, ce projet a organisé un voyage de 10 de ses agriculteurs (dont 3 femmes) dans la région de Yatenga au Burkina Faso. Tous ont été impressionnés par l’usage de fosses de plantation améliorées pour la réhabilitation de terres dégradées. Ces techniques ressemblaient à celles, traditionnelles, qu’ils connaissaient mais qui étaient dénuées d’amélioration et n’étaient appliquées qu’à petite échelle.
<p>
De retour au pays, ils ont appliqué ce traitement à 4 hectares de terre dégradée, dénudée et croûtée, et ont obtenu des résultats stupéfiants. En 1990, année de sécheresse, les agriculteurs ont traité ainsi 70 hectares. Les champs bénéficiant de fosses de plantation améliorées (tassa) on donné des rendements de l’ordre de 300 à 400 kg/ha de mil et de sorgho. Ailleurs, les rendements ont été bien inférieurs. En conséquence, le nombre d’hectares traités en 1991 a connu une forte augmentation (atteignant entre 400 et 500 ha). Depuis 1990, environ 8000 ha de terre dégradée ont été réhabilités dans le seul district d’Illéla par des cultivateurs agissant sans le moindre appui extérieur. Le projet FIDA apporte la formation et un minimum de soutien matériel, mais l’enthousiasme des paysans laisse loin derrière ses agents vulgarisateurs.
<p>
Les agriculteurs des districts voisins (Tahoua, Konni, Madoua) ont maintenant adopté la technique tassa. En d’autres points du Niger, des projets ont commencé à organiser pour leurs agriculteurs des visites de terrain dans le district d’Illéla, avec pour résultat que ceux de la région d’Ouallam (au nord de Niamey) viennent récemment d’adopter eux aussi cette technique.
<p>
Le projet FIDA de CSE du district d’Illéla a comme autre caractéristique unique qu’il a systématiquement recueilli des données de rendement correspondant aux différentes techniques qu’il encourage, données qui sont maintenant disponibles pour une période de 4 ans, y compris une année sèche (1992) et une année humide (1994).
<p>
En 1994, le rendement moyen des champs traités avec tassa et du fumier a été de 969 kg/ha tandis que celui de champs traités avec tassa, du fumier et des engrais, était de 1486 kg/ha. Un agriculteur possédant une parcelle de terre dégradée consacre 40 à 60 jours par hectare à creuser des fosses de plantation améliorées. S’il embauche de la main d’oeuvre, cela lui coûtera 30.000 CFA/ha. Si on suppose l’obtention d’un rendement de 700 kg/ha de mil, valant 80 CFA/kg, son bénéfice brut sera de 26.000 CFA pour la première année. Ce bénéfice sera amplement supérieur dans les années ultérieures, quand il lui suffira de reprendre légèrement l’excavation des fosses. Ces champs réhabilités contribuent substantiellement à la sécurité alimentaire au niveau des ménages.
<p>
Dans les districts adjacents à celui d’Illéla, d’autres projets de CSE ont amené des ensembles techniques d’un coût bien supérieur (400 dollars et plus par hectare), qui aboutissent à des rendements inférieurs, en moyenne, à ceux obtenus grâce aux fosses de plantation traditionnelles améliorées. Leurs rendements sont moindres à cause du déséquilibre qui existe entre les dimensions de l’aire réhabilitée à l’aide de machineries lourdes et la capacité des paysans à gérer adéquatement une telle superficie et à l’exploiter: ils ne disposent tout simplement pas d’une quantité suffisante de fumier pour fertiliser ces champs, ni de la main d’oeuvre nécessaire au désherbage des cultures. Les techniques simples, qui partent des pratiques locales, représentent une méthode économique de réhabilitation des terres. Les donateurs devront réfléchir à la meilleure façon de soutenir ce processus d’adoption.

<p>
L’usage systématique de techniques de CSE simples, par les paysans et dans leurs propres champs, est l’étape préliminaire indispensable de la bataille contre la dégradation des terres. Il aboutit à l’intensification de l’utilisation des terres et contribue à une meilleure sécurité alimentaire pour les ménages. Mais cela ne suffit pas car il n’affecte pas la dégradation des terres villageoises non cultivées, domaine dans lequel, précisément, les projets de gestion des terroirs au niveau du village tentent d’innover.
<p>
Les organismes donateurs peuvent faciliter et accélérer l’adoption de ces techniques de CSE simples et efficaces, en finançant les échanges de visites entre agriculteurs, la formation des cultivateurs (hommes et femmes) et un soutien matériel bien ciblé. Il faut accorder une grande priorité à l’introduction de moyens de transport locaux, comme les charrettes à âne, qui sont fabriqués dans la région, et de ce fait contribuent à l’emploi non-agricole.
<p>
De nombreux résultats ont été obtenus au Sahel ces 10 dernières années en matière de CSE. Le défi posé demeure considérable, mais au moins, nous savons mieux, désormais, ce qu’il faut faire pour le relever, et comment y procéder.

<I>Ces derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, les organismes de coop&#233;ration ont grandement accru leur soutien &#224; la r&#233;ponse des pays en d&#233;veloppement au changement du climat (voir notre Note d&#146;information No 6). La Convention-cadre des Nations unies sur les changements climatiques (CCNUCC), ratifi&#233;e par l&#146;Union europ&#233;enne et ses &#201;tats membres, est entr&#233;e en vigueur en mars 1994. Signataire de cette convention, l&#146;Union europ&#233;enne est dans l&#146;obligation d&#146;agir afin de promouvoir les objectifs du trait&#233; climatique, par des appuis financiers, des transferts de technologie et des actions de renforcement de capacit&#233;, au b&#233;n&#233;fice des pays en d&#233;veloppement</I>. 
<p>
Qu&#146;est-ce que l&#146;assistance climatique?

Les nations peuvent faire face &#224; la menace du changement climatique selon deux modalit&#233;s principales:
<ul>
<li>en r&#233;duisant leurs &#233;missions pour maintenir au minimum possible l&#146;ampleur du r&#233;chauffement atmosph&#233;rique; et
<li>en pr&#233;parant leur adaptation aux modifications du climat.
</ul><p>	
La Convention sur le climat proclame l&#146;engagement de toutes les nations &#224; agir sur ces deux fronts. En outre, les principaux pays industrialis&#233;s ont l&#146;obligation d&#146;apporter leur soutien &#224; la r&#233;action du monde en d&#233;veloppement. Cette &#171;assistance climatique&#187; a deux motifs: en premier lieu, les nations industrialis&#233;es sont tenues pour responsables de la majeure partie des &#233;missions nuisibles. En second lieu, la contribution future des pays en d&#233;veloppement aux &#233;missions risque de d&#233;passer de tr&#232;s loin celle du Nord, aggravant encore plus la menace climatique.
	<p>
L&#146;U.E. a pris une position de pointe en appelant &#224; un contr&#244;le plus pouss&#233; des &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de serre, s&#146;alignant en cela avec l&#146;Alliance des petits &#201;tats insulaires (APEI - AOSIS en anglais1) lors des n&#233;gociations sur le climat. Mais elle n&#146;a pas encore adopt&#233; une position similaire quant &#224; l&#146;assistance climatique.
<p>	 
Plus pr&#233;cis&#233;ment, l&#146;U.E. s&#146;est engag&#233;e &#224; soutenir la mise en oeuvre de la Convention sur le climat dans les pays ACP:
<ul>
<li>par l&#146;&#233;tablissement d&#146;inventaires des gaz &#224; effets de serre et de leurs puits de captage;
<li>par la pr&#233;paration et la mise en oeuvre de strat&#233;gies d&#146;adaptation au climat pour les pays vuln&#233;rables aux changements climatiques, en particulier ceux des r&#233;gions littorales et les petits &#201;tats insulaires;
<li>par la promotion de sources d&#146;&#233;nergies propres et efficaces;
<li>par des efforts visant &#224; limiter le d&#233;boisement, le br&#251;lage des terres foresti&#232;res et arables et par d&#146;autres modifications des modes d&#146;utilisation des terres qui entra&#238;nent des &#233;missions de CO2; et
<li>par l&#146;introduction de nouvelles pratiques agricoles pour r&#233;duire les &#233;missions de m&#233;thane.
</ul><p>
Cette Note d&#146;information donne des exemples de projets d&#146;assistance climatique en cours de d&#233;ploiement par des &#201;tats membres de l&#146;U.E. et par d&#146;autres pays.

<H3>Actions au sein de l&#146;Union europ&#233;enne</H3>

Les &#201;tats membres participent &#224; un certain nombre d&#146;activit&#233;s bilat&#233;rales, dont la plupart sont explicitement destin&#233;es &#224; soutenir les nations en d&#233;veloppement dans leurs efforts de respect des engagements formels actuels auxquels elles ont souscrit dans le cadre de la CCNUCC. Certaines de ces initiatives vont plus loin, afin de promouvoir des mesures pouvant s&#146;av&#233;rer n&#233;cessaires dans l&#146;avenir.
<ul>
<li>L&#146;agence allemande de coop&#233;ration technique (GTZ) a mis sur pied, par exemple, un programme de recherches nationales pour les pays en d&#233;veloppement, la priorit&#233; &#233;tant accord&#233;e aux &#233;tudes nationales sur les questions &#233;nerg&#233;tiques.  Voir l&#146;encadr&#233; ci-dessous pour de plus amples d&#233;tails.
<p>
<li>L&#146;agence su&#233;doise de coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement international finance, par l&#146;interm&#233;diaire de l&#146;Institut de l&#146;environnement de Stockholm, une &#233;tude des r&#233;actions d&#146;adaptation aux changements du climat en Inde ainsi qu&#146;un projet de diss&#233;mination de l&#146;information. De concert avec d&#146;autres organismes nationaux et internationaux, le gouvernement su&#233;dois a financ&#233; une &#233;tude des options et r&#233;actions d&#146;ordre politique dont dispose l&#146;Afrique face au changement climatique plan&#233;taire.
<p>
<li>Le minist&#232;re hollandais des affaires &#233;trang&#232;res et de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement met sur pied des programmes d&#146;&#233;tudes nationales, au Ghana, au S&#233;n&#233;gal et ailleurs, pour obtenir des inventaires des gaz &#224; effet de serre, des &#233;valuations de vuln&#233;rabilit&#233;, et des options disponibles en mati&#232;re de technologie, d&#146;instruments politiques et de co&#251;ts.
<p>
<li>Le Danemark a &#233;tabli la coop&#233;ration danoise pour l&#146;environnement et le d&#233;veloppement (DANCED), b&#233;n&#233;ficiant d&#146;une allocation budg&#233;taire suppl&#233;mentaire, afin de traiter les probl&#232;mes &#233;cologiques plan&#233;taires et de mettre en oeuvre les accords du Sommet plan&#232;te Terre. La DANCED concentrera ses efforts sur des th&#232;mes relatifs aux zones urbaines, aux for&#234;ts, &#224; la diversit&#233; biologique et aux zones littorales (en Asie du Sud-Est et en Afrique australe). Le gouvernement danois a particip&#233; au financement d&#146;une &#233;tude climatique men&#233;e par l&#146;institut de recherche &#233;nerg&#233;tique Tata (en Inde) et, au Zimbabwe, &#224; une recherche de port&#233;e nationale sur la diminution des &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de serre.
<p>
<li>Le Fonds fran&#231;ais pour l&#146;environnement mondial, qui repose lui aussi sur un financement suppl&#233;mentaire, se veut le catalyseur des efforts fran&#231;ais d&#146;assistance dans les domaines du changement climatique, de la biodiversit&#233;, de l&#146;appauvrissement de la couche d&#146;ozone et dans celui des eaux internationales. Ses projets seront int&#233;gr&#233;s &#224; des programmes de d&#233;veloppement durable de plus grande ampleur et porteront sur le renforcement des capacit&#233;s et sur la formation aux technologies propres.
</ul>
<H3>Aboutir &#224; une r&#233;ponse coordonn&#233;e</H3>

Lors des n&#233;gociations sur le climat, certains ont fait part de leur inqui&#233;tude quant au risque que des initiatives bilat&#233;rales puissent affaiblir les objectifs de la Convention sur le climat, &#224; moins qu&#146;on ne parvienne &#224; une certaine mesure de coordination ou, &#224; tout le moins, de connaissance mutuelle des activit&#233;s de chacun. Conform&#233;ment aux dispositions du trait&#233; d&#146;Union europ&#233;enne relatives &#224; la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement, l&#146;U.E. &#224; la responsabilit&#233; toute sp&#233;ciale d&#146;assurer que les actions des Communaut&#233;s ainsi que celles de ses &#201;tats membres soit bien coordonn&#233;es et se compl&#232;tent.

<tr><td><center><h4>SOUTIEN &#192; LA MISE EN OEUVRE DE LA CONVENTION SUR LE CLIMAT</h4></center>
<p>
L&#146;agence allemande de coop&#233;ration technique (GTZ), apporte actuellement son soutien aux pays en d&#233;veloppement dans la pr&#233;paration des &#233;tudes nationales r&#233;clam&#233;es par la Convention sur le climat. Le programme de ses activit&#233;s se concentre sur la r&#233;alisation d&#146;&#233;quilibres dans les &#233;missions de gaz et sur la diminution des &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de serre, en mod&#233;rant, en particulier, celles de CO2. G&#233;ographiquement, les efforts portent surtout sur l&#146;Afrique australe et l&#146;Asie.
<p>	
En Zambie, la GTZ a parrain&#233; l&#146;&#233;tablissement d&#146;un inventaire et une enqu&#234;te sur les options d&#146;att&#233;nuation et sur les strat&#233;gies politiques de constitution de capacit&#233;, men&#233;e par le minist&#232;re de l&#146;eau et du d&#233;veloppement &#233;nerg&#233;tique, avec l&#146;appui du Centre austral pour l&#146;&#233;nergie et l&#146;environnement au Zimbabwe. On s&#146;est livr&#233;, dans ce projet, &#224; une estimation des sources et des puits de captage ainsi que des futures tendances des &#233;missions, &#224; l&#146;identification des options d&#146;efficacit&#233;-co&#251;t pour &#233;viter les &#233;missions et &#224; l&#146;&#233;laboration d&#146;objectifs nationaux recommand&#233;s pour la diminution des &#233;missions.
	<p>
En Tanzanie, le Centre pour l&#146;environnement, l&#146;&#233;nergie, les sciences et la technologie de Dar-es-Salam s&#146;est lanc&#233; dans une &#233;tude d&#146;att&#233;nuation des &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de serre, men&#233;e au nom du minist&#232;re du tourisme, des ressources naturelles et de l&#146;environnement. Cette recherche a envisag&#233; non seulement les options technologiques de r&#233;duction des &#233;missions, sous l&#146;angle de leur efficacit&#233;-co&#251;t, mais aussi les aspects sociaux, culturels et politiques de la mise en oeuvre de ces options ainsi que leur pertinence vis-&#224;-vis de la politique &#233;nerg&#233;tique nationale.
		<p>
On donnera priorit&#233; aux projets &#224; retomb&#233;es positives aux niveaux micro- et macro-&#233;conomiques -  qu&#146;ils engendrent des &#233;conomies d&#146;&#233;nergie ou aboutissent &#224; une meilleure efficacit&#233; &#233;nerg&#233;tique - et permettant de r&#233;duire les &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de serre.  Voici, par exemple, une &#233;tude sur l&#146;emploi des sources d&#146;&#233;nergies renouvelables pour l&#146;alimentation &#233;lectrique de la Namibie, actuellement au stade pr&#233;paratoire. Ce projet envisagera les sites potentiels des centrales &#224; source d&#146;&#233;nergie renouvelable et les crit&#232;res de conception de g&#233;n&#233;rateurs &#224; &#233;nergie solaire, thermale et &#233;olienne, fera l&#146;&#233;valuation des aspects &#233;conomiques des installations &#233;lectrog&#232;nes retenues et en estimera les avantages &#233;cologiques.
	<p>
Le minist&#232;re des transports et de l&#146;&#233;nergie du Zimbabwe soutient un projet d&#146;&#233;tude du potentiel de mise en commun r&#233;gionale des ressources &#233;lectriques en Afrique australe. Cette enqu&#234;te prendra en consid&#233;ration les &#233;conomies d&#146;&#233;missions pouvant r&#233;sulter d&#146;un tel groupement &#233;nerg&#233;tique ainsi que sa faisabilit&#233; technique; elle cherchera &#224; savoir si les autorit&#233;s r&#233;gionales sont ou non pr&#234;tes &#224; appuyer une initiative de ce genre et voudra aussi d&#233;finir les pr&#233;conditions techniques, politiques et administratives n&#233;cessaires au succ&#232;s d&#146;un pareil projet.

<H3>R&#233;fl&#233;chir &#224; une mise en oeuvre conjointe</H3>

Outre leurs projets traditionnels d&#146;aide au d&#233;veloppement, les pays industrialis&#233;s songent aussi &#224; une &#171;mise en oeuvre conjointe&#187; (voir notre Note d&#146;information No 6). Les mesures de contr&#244;le des &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de serre et d&#146;incitation &#224; l&#146;&#233;limination de ces gaz par l&#146;am&#233;lioration des puits de captage (en proc&#233;dant, par exemple, au reboisement), ont des co&#251;ts qui varient d&#146;un pays &#224; l&#146;autre. La coop&#233;ration entre &#201;tats peut am&#233;liorer l&#146;efficacit&#233;-co&#251;t de telles op&#233;rations, un pays pouvant subventionner des mesures prise dans un autre pays et &#233;tant cr&#233;dit&#233; des r&#233;ductions d&#146;&#233;missions qui en d&#233;coulent.
<p>	
Un vif d&#233;bat entoure depuis quelques ann&#233;es cette notion de mise en oeuvre conjointe et les crit&#232;res applicables &#224; de tels programmes pour qu&#146;ils soient efficaces et ne d&#233;savantagent pas les pays plus pauvres ont fait l&#146;objet d&#146;abondantes discussions. Selon la Convention sur le climat, tout projet, ou activit&#233;, &#171;mis en oeuvre conjointement&#187; doit comporter une phase pilote. Cette formulation particuli&#232;re a &#233;t&#233; adopt&#233;e pour bien souligner le fait qu&#146;il n&#146;y a pas encore d&#146;accord sur les crit&#232;res des programmes &#224; mise en oeuvre conjointe.
La phase pilote recouvre des activit&#233;s mises en oeuvre conjointement par des parties contractantes figurant &#224; l&#146;Appendice I (liste des nations industrialis&#233;es et plus riches) et, sur une base purement volontaire, entre elles et des parties ne figurant pas &#224; cet appendice. Ces activit&#233;s de phase pilote doivent:
<ul>
<li>&#234;tre compatibles avec, et appuyer, les priorit&#233;s et strat&#233;gies nationales en mati&#232;re d&#146;environnement et de d&#233;veloppement;
<li>contribuer &#224; l&#146;efficacit&#233;-co&#251;t dans l&#146;obtention d&#146;avantages au plan mondial;
<li>&#234;tre men&#233;es de mani&#232;re globale, portant sur toutes les sources, tous les puits de captage et r&#233;servoirs de gaz &#224; effet de serre, pertinents pour le projet; et
<li>apporter des avantages &#233;cologiques concrets, mesurables et &#224; long terme quant &#224; l&#146;att&#233;nuation des changements climatiques, avantages qui n&#146;auraient pas &#233;t&#233; obtenus en l&#146;absence de ces activit&#233;s.
</ul><p>
Le financement de tels projets doit &#234;tre &#233;tabli en surcro&#238;t des obligations budg&#233;taires existantes et des flux actuels de l&#146;aide au d&#233;veloppement. Pour le moment, les parties &#224; la Convention ne pourront pas se voir cr&#233;diter au titre de ces projets, par rapport &#224; leurs propres objectifs nationaux de r&#233;duction des &#233;missions.
<p>	
&#192; l&#146;automne 1995, 17 projets de ce type avaient obtenu l&#146;agr&#233;ment des gouvernements des pays concern&#233;s. Un certain nombre d&#146;&#201;tats membres sont en train de mettre sur pied avec des pays en d&#233;veloppement des projets &#224; mise en oeuvre conjointe, et ont &#233;tabli des programmes en partenariat avec des nations d&#146;Europe orientale et de la F&#233;d&#233;ration russe. C&#146;est le cas, par exemple, du gouvernement hollandais qui s&#146;est engag&#233; sur un budget annuel de 12 millions de florins (environ 36,6 millions de francs fran&#231;ais) pour la p&#233;riode 1997-99 afin de (co)financer des projets pilotes dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement, avec un m&#234;me montant consacr&#233; &#224; des projets en Europe centrale et orientale. Les &#201;tats-Unis investissent dans les nations en d&#233;veloppement d&#146;Am&#233;rique centrale et du Sud. Le secteur priv&#233; joue un r&#244;le important dans nombre de ces projets, apportant des disponibilit&#233;s d&#146;investissement suppl&#233;mentaires.
<p>	
La plupart des projets actuels concernent le domaine &#233;nerg&#233;tique - &#233;lectrification &#224; base solaire, captation de l&#146;&#233;nergie &#233;olienne, &#233;conomies d&#146;&#233;nergie, compression du gaz naturel, conversion du charbon au gaz - car c&#146;est l&#224; qu&#146;on peut r&#233;aliser les progr&#232;s les plus significatifs dans le ralentissement de la croissance des &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de serre.
<p>
Ainsi, au Costa Rica, la construction de 55 &#233;oliennes (20 MW) a d&#233;but&#233; au printemps 1995. Ce projet, dit Plantas Eolicas, repr&#233;sente la premi&#232;re production d&#146;&#233;lectricit&#233; &#224; &#233;nergie &#233;olienne r&#233;alis&#233;e &#224; &#233;chelle commerciale et r&#233;sulte d&#146;une initiative de 30 millions de dollars men&#233;e conjointement par la compagnie nationale d&#146;&#233;lectricit&#233; du pays (l&#146;Instituto costaricense de electricidad) et trois entreprises priv&#233;es nord-am&#233;ricaines (avec l&#146;agr&#233;ment du gouvernement am&#233;ricain). On estime qu&#146;il permettra de r&#233;duire les &#233;missions de CO2 au rythme de 100 000 tonnes par an si l&#146;&#233;lectricit&#233; d&#146;origine &#233;olienne qu&#146;il produit remplace celle des centrales thermiques. 

<H3>Le progr&#232;s du Fond pour l&#146;environnement mondial</H3>

C&#146;est le Fond pour l&#146;environnement mondial (FEM) qui doit faire fonctionner pendant quatre ans encore le m&#233;canisme financier de la Convention sur le climat. Il a &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;cis&#233;, selon la Convention, que les projets financ&#233;s par le FEM verront leur efficacit&#233; mesur&#233;e par rapport &#224; leur co&#251;t, qu&#146;ils devront soutenir les priorit&#233;s nationales de d&#233;veloppement et porter, en tout cas en premier lieu, sur la facilitation d&#146;activit&#233;s pouvant aider les pays en d&#233;veloppement &#224; mettre en oeuvre cette convention.
<p>
&#192; compter de d&#233;cembre 1995, le programme de travail du FEM couvrait un montant total de 328 millions de dollars consacr&#233;s au domaine du changement climatique. La plupart des projets concern&#233;s ont pour orientation le soutien aux r&#233;ponses des pays en d&#233;veloppement &#224; la Convention sur la climat, avec tendance, &#224; ce jour, en faveur de questions de contr&#244;le des &#233;missions plut&#244;t que vers des strat&#233;gies d&#146;adaptation. On rel&#232;ve aussi une forte composante destin&#233;e &#224; la constitution de capacit&#233;s.
	<p>
Pour ne citer qu&#146;un exemple, voici le cas des Maldives, qui ont re&#231;u un million de dollars du FEM pour entreprendre un inventaire de leurs &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de serre et un projet d&#146;&#233;valuation d&#146;adaptation. L&#146;objectif de ce dernier consiste &#224; accro&#238;tre la capacit&#233; de ce petit &#201;tat insulaire en mati&#232;re de contr&#244;le des &#233;missions et d&#146;&#233;valuation de vuln&#233;rabilit&#233;. Le projet pr&#233;voit la diffusion de l&#146;approche et des r&#233;sultats aupr&#232;s d&#146;autres petites nations insulaires en d&#233;veloppement afin qu&#146;elles puissent b&#233;n&#233;ficier de cet exercice de constitution de capacit&#233;.
<p>	
En Afrique, le Soudan est impliqu&#233; dans un projetde 0,3 million de dollars pour renforcer sa capacit&#233;&#233; &#224; satisfaire aux exigences de la Convention sur le climat. Ce pays est aussi l&#146;objet d&#146;une &#233;tude de 1,5 million de dollars sur la r&#233;tention du carbone et sur la protection de la biodiversit&#233; par la r&#233;habilitation &#224; base communautaire des terres de parcours.
<p>
2,5 millions de dollars ont &#233;t&#233; attribu&#233;s par le FEM &#224; un projet d&#146;&#233;nergie domestique au Mali et 2 millions, &#224; un projet d&#146;&#233;nergie &#233;olienne d&#233;centralis&#233;e en Mauritanie.  Le Zimbabwe entreprend un projet photobolta&#239;que de 7 millions de dollars &#224; usage domestique et communautaire.

Le Programme d&#146;environnement r&#233;gional du Pacifique sud (SPREP) a mis sur pied le Programme d&#146;action sur le changement climatique dans les &#238;les du Pacifique (PICCAP) afin de coordonner et de mettre en &#156;uvre toutes les activit&#233;s de la r&#233;gion relatives au climat et au niveau de la mer.
	<p> 
Organisation intergouvernementale autonome dont les membres proviennent de 26 pays, le SPREP est l&#146;agence environnementale de t&#234;te en Oc&#233;anie.
	<p>
Le PICCAP se concentre sur la recherche scientifique, les &#233;valuations d&#146;impact, les strat&#233;gies de r&#233;ponse ainsi que sur la formation, l&#146;&#233;ducation et la prise de conscience du public.
	<p>
&#192; ce titre, des activit&#233;s sont en cours aux &#206;les Cook, dans les &#201;tats f&#233;d&#233;r&#233;s de Micron&#233;sie, aux Fidji, en Polyn&#233;sie fran&#231;aise, &#224; Guam, &#224; Kiribati, aux &#206;les Marshall, &#224; Nauru, en Nouvelle-Cal&#233;donie, &#224; Niue, &#224; Palau, en Papouasie Nouvelle-Guin&#233;e, aux &#206;les Salomon, &#224; Tokelau, &#224; Tonga, &#224; Tuvalu, au Vanuatu et aux Samoa occidentales.
	<p>
Pour les deux ou trois prochaines ann&#233;es, le secr&#233;tariat du SPREP entend assister les membres de l&#146;organisation dans l&#146;&#233;laboration et la planification de politiques nationales relatives aux changements du climat et du niveau de la mer, comme le veut la Convention-cadre des Nations unies sur les changements climatiques.

En compagnie des nations en d&#233;veloppement - plus vuln&#233;rables - l&#146;U.E. a pris une position de pointe, r&#233;clamant de plus stricts contr&#244;les des &#233;missions dans le cadre de la Convention sur le climat. Un &#233;lan a ainsi &#233;t&#233; pris au plan politique, et l&#146;U.E. devrait le mettre &#224; profit pour &#233;laborer une position politique claire liant le climat et la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. Cela pourrait se faire &#224; partir d&#146;une d&#146;exp&#233;rience qui ne cesse de s&#146;accumuler en mati&#232;re d&#146;assistance climatique, exp&#233;rience acquise gr&#226;ce &#224; des programmes bilat&#233;raux, au Fond pour l&#146;environnement mondial et aux projets pilotes de mise en oeuvre conjointe.

<p>
Official Austrian development cooperation started in the mid 1970s, based on charitable church-related and a
voluntary tradition of assistance to post-war European countries and refugees. Attention and assistance
traditionally were more focused on the consequences of East - West conflicts than on North - South
relations. Its neutral position in international politics facilitated Austria's intermediary role in UN affairs.
North - South development cooperation received rather belatedly attention in Austrian politics. Although the
majority of the Austrian public has a positive attitude towards development cooperation, it does not yet
appear to be well informed on this point, and appears to overestimate current Austrian development efforts.
Development education activities are stepped up by the Government. 
<p>
Net official development assistance amounted to US $ 556 million in 1992, which was 0.30 per cent of
GNP. This percentage was 0.25 cent in 1990 and 0.34 in 1991. The Government has stated the intention to
reach the DAC average (1990) for ODA of 0.35 per cent of GNP and, later, the EU average for ODA of
0.51 per cent. In 1992 24 per cent of Austria's ODA was disbursed through multilateral channels.
Multilateral contributions increase faster than the bilateral component, and will continue to do so as a
consequence of Austria's EU membership.

<h4>This Report</h4>
The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) conducts periodic reviews to improve the individual and collective development co-operation efforts of its members.
<p>
The peer review is prepared by the Secretariat and involves staff from development agencies in other DAC member countries. A draft report of the team is prepared by the Secretariat and it forms the basis for a review meeting with the member.
<p>
This publication contains the conclusions as agreed by DAC following the review meeting on 15 June 1994, as well as the report prepared by the Secretariat team.
<p>
<h4>Main Points</h4>
The aid volume of the Netherlands has for a long time surpassed the United Nations target of 0.7% of gross national product (GNP) and the Dutch aid programme has set quality standards in several respects. In recent years however, volume has stagnated and there has been no growth in real terms since the mid-1980's. Volume fell 5% in real terms in 1993 and the ODA/GNP ratio has declined from 0.99% in 1987/87 to an estimated 0.81% in 1993.
<p>
 New orientations for Dutch development cooperation policy were outlined in a government white paper of 1993: "A World in Dispute." In this, maintenance and restoration of peace is advocated as an additional objective for traditional aid, particularly as a way to deal with the many "man-made" crises that now beset the world. While these orientations still need detailed work and discussion to become operational, they illustrate how one donor is re-defining its role and programme in relation to the new aid context.
<p>
In this regard, this review gives special consideration to the coherence betweeen emergency assistance and long-term development cooperation, integration of development programmes with the efforts of other government departments, the capacity of the Dutch aid administration to manage the widened programme, aid relationships with recipient countries, and improvements in the aid evaluation system.

NEWS FROM THE KIRKSTALL VALLEY CAMPAIGN



Residents of Kirkstall, Leeds are taking action this week in an attempt

to block plans for a large supermarket and retail complex in the

Kirkstall Valley.



A recent highly successful action in which supporters of Earth First!

occupied the Chairman of Morrisons PLC's office secured a meeting

between him and KVC, but the company failed to make any significant

concessions. Now, local residents are taking their own action which they

are inviting all organisations and individuals opposed to irresponsible

retail development to join.



On Thursday, January 30th at 4.00 pm there will be a "Mass Crossing" at

pedestrian controlled lights on the A65 (Kirkstall Road). This road is

already seriously overloaded at peak times, and the action could result

in "gridlock" right back to Leeds city centre. The proposed Morrison's

development would put between 5 and 10 thousand extra vehicles a day on

the route. People wishing to take part should meet at the Netto car park

on Kirkstall Road at 3.45. It is intended that the action will be over

by 5.00pm



The next day, Friday 31st Januiary, also at 4.00pm, we will demonstrate

outside Leeds Civic Hall where the LCC Highways. committee will be

meeting. This body has the power to prevent the Morrisons development by

refusing to approve the neccessary road works on the grounds that they

are not in the public interest. Meet for this action on the Civic Hall

steps at 3.45pm.



On the evening of Friday 31st there will be a benefit gig for the

Campaign. Local bands IZON PARADISE, THE TULIP LOUNGE and BINGO will be

playing at THE DUCHESS Vicar Lane, Leeds. Doors open 8.00pm, admission

three pounds.

Thanks again for your support - I hope we will be linking to you from

our very own page soon.

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Irish Development Cooperation</h3></a>

Ireland became independent in 1922 and joined the United Nations in 1955. Official
development cooperation started in 1973 and was built upon previous efforts of voluntary
and non-governmental organisations. Development cooperation is based upon the direct
contacts of Irish people living in Third World countries during British colonial rule, Irish
emigrants to a number of these countries, a strong and substantial Irish Roman Catholic
missionary tradition and (respect for) its anti-colonial stand during British rule. The high level
of resources raised by Irish NGOs is an indication of the significant public support for
development cooperation efforts of these organisations. In fact, NGO aid-activities still seem
more popular, and known, than the substantial government programme. 
<p>
Net official development assistance in 1992 stood at US $ 69 million, which was 0.16 per cent
of GNP, after a sharp decrease in 1987. The amount will increase by 0.05 per cent of GNP
each year until 1997. In 1992 42 per cent of total ODA was disbursed through the EU, and 17
per cent of ODA went to other multilateral channels. The Government decided to raise the
bilateral aid budget at a faster rate than multilateral aid in the coming years, so as to achieve
a situation where two thirds of its aid is bilateral.

<a name="ins"><hr><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>

Irish aid is administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, under the political
responsibility of a Minister of State responsible for European Affairs and ODA. He reports
to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Contributions for the World Bank group are handled by the
Department of Finance, and food aid by the Department of Agriculture. Irish aid being for a
large part technical assistance, is mainly implemented by NGOs.
<p>
The Development Cooperation Division (DCD) of the Department of Foreign Affairs
coordinates Ireland's bilateral and multilateral development assistance programmes. It is
responsible for the administration of the bilateral programme, emergency aid (mostly through
NGOs), participation in EU development programmes, and contributions to UN relief and
development agencies.
<p>
Development Cooperation Offices coordinate Irish aid in priority countries. The Agency for
Personal Service Overseas (APSO), a parastatal organisation, carries out the recruitment,
training, funding and monitoring of Irish personnel for developing countries.
<p>
An Inter-departmental Committee on Development Cooperation, in which the principal
economic departments are represented, oversees the ODA programme. A Subcommittee, the
Projects Appraisal and Evaluation Group (PAEG), chaired by the DCD assesses all projects
separately. The Subcommittee includes the desk officers of the DCD, the Evaluation and
Planning Unit of the DCD, and representatives of the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture, and
Industry and Commerce, 
<p>
Planning and evaluation at the Development Cooperation Division are carried out by an
internal Planning and Evaluation Unit with the assistance of outside consultants.


<a name="adv"><hr><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>

In 1979 an Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (ACDC) was established for a
three year term. There have been four Councils since. The last one was abolished in
December 1991. The Councils have taken a very independent position and were at times
quite critical of the aid programme and of the work of the Department. Amongst others the
ACDC criticised the arrangements of the PAEG as being unwieldy and incomplete and the
absence of any substantial policy dialogue with partner developing countries.  The ACDC
used to include representatives of a wide section of Irish society, forming a broad
constituency but operating as individuals: trade unions, farmer's organisations, academics,
organisations of churches and a delegate from Northern Ireland. 
<p>
In January 1994 a new Irish Aid Advisory Committee (IAAC) was installed. The Committee has
fourteen members, who are appointed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The term of office
is two years. Membership is a honourary function. The function of the Committee is to offer
expert advice to the Minister on all matters relating to development cooperation and on
policy and management aspects of the aid programme. The IAAC is an independent body that
has the right of initiative. After consultation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs the
Committee may have research conducted on its behalf and arrange for publication. The
Committee receives an annual budget paid from bilateral ODA funds.
<p>
The Committee meets every five or six weeks while its terms of reference mention a
minimum of four meetings a year. A representative of the Department may attend meetings.
The secretariat consists of one person and is located at the Department. The Executive
Secretary works on a contract basis for the Committee and is not a civil servant. The present
agenda is not known yet since the IAAC has just started its work. 
<p>
In 1993 a new Parliamentary Sub-committee was established to deal specifically with
development cooperation. The Sub-committee can hear representatives of NGOs and
officials of the Government.

<a name="ngo"><hr><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3><p></a>

Contributions by Irish NGOs are proportionally the largest among DAC member countries.
The Government manages a co-financing program through which it funds part of the costs
of NGO-initiated projects of its "basic needs priority policy". These projects include health-care, education, water supply, sanitation, employment creation, agriculture, and rural
development. The greater part of the humanitarian assistance budget is channelled through
Irish NGOs. The NGOs identify the majority of emergency aid projects. In 1993  an estimated
2.1 per cent of total Irish ODA was channelled through the co-financing programme with
NGOs. An umbrella body, the Confederation of Non-Governmental Organisations for
Overseas Development (CONGOOD) was established in 1979. It draws together 18 aid and
missionary organisations. There are about 50 development related NGOs in Ireland. 
<p>
Representatives of the NGOs and the Minister or his officials hold regular meetings to
discuss matters of mutual interest, amongst others the prolongation of the one-year period
for co-financing projects and procedures for emergency aid and development education.
Two points of critique by the NGO-community are that the new strategy is less clearly
directed towards poverty alleviation than was expected and that personnel cooperation
overseas is increasingly tied up with procurement of goods and services in Ireland. Annually
a National Forum on Development Aid takes place, whose deliberations influence
development cooperation policy. 
<p>
According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey three Irish institutes qualify as Development
Research and Training Institutes. The research community takes an active stand on
development cooperation. For instance: after the abolishment of ACDC the research
community played an active part in the installation of the new Advisory Committee.

The Week in Europe, 7 November 1996</h2>
<h4>by <i>David Jessop</i>
<p>
Executive Director of the Caribbean Council for Europe</h4>
</center>
<hr>
<P>
Can sovereignty ever be compromised and if so are politicians alone able to
take responsibility for agreeing to such a step? In an increasingly
interdependent world this  issue and its associated questions are fast
becoming one of, if not the leading political issue in both the Caribbean
and the EU.
<p>
During the cold war, sovereignty and its protection at all costs was the
norm. Otherwise, it was argued, where would the West or the East be if
compromises led to a shift in political allegiance? It was the cement that
kept the Berlin Wall in place until the people of eastern Europe realised
that it was an issue that belonged to them not government. 
<p>
All that has been blown away by first, the ending of the cold war and its
geo-political certainties and more recently by the unstoppable process of
globalisation. Whereas in the past political parties found their politics
defined by the need to defend sovereignty, they are today, almost without
exception, struggling to define to their people their competence in a world
in which the markets take the decisions. Governments and political parties
are having now to decide whether to choose between pragmatism, whether to
take the moral high ground by arguing for the status quo or, if they are
clever, trying to redefine what sovereignty now means. 
<p>
In the Caribbean this can be seen in the varying responses to the question
of co-operation on narcotics issues with nations outside the region. In
Europe the debate focuses on the establishment of the European Monetary
System and the ever growing body of EU regulations overriding national
legislation. Internationally it is reflected in the US Congress's desire to
extend its powers to attempt to control trade by third nations with Cuba,
Libya and Iran. And less exciting, but just as potent, is the threat to
sovereignty posed by the extension of European or US reciprocal free trade
areas to many regions including the Caribbean. 
<p>
The Caribbean's most recent encounter with the question of sovereignty came
in the context of US insistence on hot pursuit of narcotics traffickers
through shiprider and other agreements which seek to allow US agencies to
operate within the jurisdiction of  Caribbean nations. Caribbean
governments took different positions on this issue. A number argued, quite
rightly, that it was one matter to allow such operations within territorial
waters through special treaty arrangements and quite another to grant such
privileges onshore. Legal experts and those concerned with consistency
argued otherwise and suggested this was a false dichotomy. But to citizens
and politicians it is a matter that reached to the heart of what government
and representative democracy were all about. 
<p>
On these questions perception matters. Citizens want the right to decide
who does what in their own country and few if any vote to allow another
state to take decisions for or act directly in their nation. That is why
sovereignty is a populist issue which cannot be dealt with lightly and
requires great sensitivity on the part of all if serious confrontations are
to be avoided.  It is not about the evil of narcotics trafficking but about
the role and existence of nation states.
<p>
The same is true in Europe as witnessed by the heated debate now underway
over the European Monetary Union (EMU). This mechanism envisaged by the
Maastricht Treaty is meant to create a single EU currency from 1998 onwards
. It has the capacity to split Europe. Already nations such as Britain,
Italy and Greece that are unlikely to meet the convergence criteria, unless
they like France massage their figures, are growing increasingly angry and
concerned at a number of levels. Criticism runs from technical arguments by
bankers through to a sentimental attachment to, for instance, the pound
sterling. But most potent of all is the arguments comes from those who see
EMU as a threat to sovereignty. They argue that individual states should
not give control of economic decisions over questions such as base rates
and money supply to the stronger economies in Europe. Such decisions they
suggest are what makes a state sovereign.
<p>
The issue of  the exercise of sovereignty is also becoming more complex as
evidenced by the acrimonious debate between the EU, the US and the
Caribbean over the US Helms/Burton legislation on Cuba. First the US
Congress sought to impose its will on the world at large, then the EU
agreed to retaliate and in the week past, the US and EU have begun to
attempt to find common ground on Cuba over measures that they hope might
encourage democracy and the growth of civic society there. Forgotten in all
of this is Cuba's intense nationalism, the fact that its revolution was
based on the people's desire to see a re-assertion of sovereignty against
the US and the subsequent guiding principle that sovereignty can never be
compromised.
<p>
Less likely to engender such political passion as yet, is the desire to
establish over time free trade areas (FTAs) with the hemisphere by the
United States and the EU, if it decides to extend its thinking after the
year 2000 about FTAs for Latin America to the Caribbean. As these ideas are
taken forward the Caribbean is likely to find itself standing at a
metaphorical cross-roads in the debate about sovereignty as both the US and
EU FTA processes will, over time, require reciprocity. Unlike Brazil where
its size and economic and political muscle will continue to determine its
freedom of action, Caribbean islands may find that reciprocity eventually
removes from government the ability to determine many aspects of economic
policy. 
<p>
All of this is not to suggest that the free trade process, the structure of
the post war world or globalisation can in some way be changed or ignored
but that Caribbean solutions will have to be found that seek to redefine
and educate the people about the new nature of sovereignty and by extension
government's role.
<p>
The danger is that if in parallel to the many other complex issues that the
region has to consider this component is not fully debated, governments may
loose touch with popular sentiment. A lack of clarity may also lead outside
of the region to the assumption that wholly unacceptable solutions such as
that proposed by US ex Assistant Secretary of State, Eliot Abrams, may be a
viable way forward. In his little read but often talked about paper "The 
Shiprider Solution" he suggested in part that the US take charge of 
defence and foreign policy in smaller Caribbean States in return for
guarantees of aid. This profoundly undemocratic thought, which challenges
every concept of sovereignty, rightly brought indignation in the Caribbean.
But what the anger also showed was a sense of uncertainty about the future.
<p>
As in Europe, there is a pressing need in the Caribbean to debate how
nation states,  particularly those that are small, define and retain
sovereignty now that open economies and trade advantage, rather than
political ideology, have come to dominate the global agenda.

British nurse Rachael Tapsell covered herself from head to footin a heavy veil when she went to help women and children in the Kandaharprovince of south-west Afghanistan, desperately poor after years of civilwar.The province,once a dangerous no-go zone,had just switched to strictIslamic control.<p>One of the new religious rules stated that women had to swathethemselves in full-length veils,know as <i>burqas. &nbsp;</i>If Rachael wanted to workin the hospitals and clinics,she would have to wear a burqa too.<p><i>"Wearing the burqa was an extraordinary experience"&nbsp;</i>,says Rachael. <i>"I'musually confident,vocal and happy but I sometimes felt withdrawn andisolated. If felt if I shouted people wouldn't hear"&nbsp;</i>.<p>Rachael was in Afghanistan with MERLIN,a British charity that sendsdoctors,nurses and supplies to war zones and disaster areas. As medical co-ordinator,it was her job to set up district clinics and supply much-neededmedicines to the area. Years of civil war had left the province's hospitalsbadly damaged and run down. <p>Getting Rachael into Afghanistan was hard work. There were no otherWestern women in the country at that time,and Rachael and her maleMERLIN colleagues needed all their powers of persuasion in their talks withthe religious leaders,the <i>mullahs. &nbsp;</i><p><i>"At first the authorities were very sceptical and cautious"&nbsp;</i>, remembersRachael.<i>"We explained that we wanted to run a woman and child healthprogramme, and that we wanted a Western female nurse, otherwise wewouldn't set up the programme. Fortunately, they agreed.&nbsp;</i><p>Gradually, things got easier. Rachael and her colleagues began setting uptheir programme and the religious leaders relaxed some of their rules.That meant that women could leave their homes to go shopping andRachael no longer had to wear the veil all the time. Life was still hard,though. Taking time off was tricky, partly because they were living in oneof the most heavily mined areas of Afghanistan.<p><i>"We played volleyball in the compound, but because of the landmines weseldom went for a walk on our own in the town or countryside"&nbsp;</i>, saysRachael.<i> "Work becomes your real focus, because there's so little else todo".&nbsp;</i><p>Keeping away from minefields is a long way from Rachael's early days asa nurse. After training as a registered general nurse in Canterbury Hospital,Kent, she went to St Thomas's Hospital in London for a two-year stint onthe wards. <i>"I realised then I wasn't a career nurse"&nbsp;</i>,she says. <i>"I wanted totravel".&nbsp;</i><p>A brief spell in West Africa and as a volunteer on an aid convoy to Bosniaconfirmed her dream. <i>"I was sitting at home with my family on ChristmasEve and I was watching the news about the horrors in Bosnia. I wanted todo something and I also wanted to see if I could cope with the work".&nbsp;</i>Rachael went - and loved it. <i>"It was an exciting opportunity: I was bittenby the bug"&nbsp;</i>.<a name="education"></a><p><hr><p><center><img border=1 src="oda_pix/education.gif"></center><p><li>Ghana is the focus of three new publications for key stage three pupilsproduced by the Development Education Centre in Birmingham.<p><i>Land and Life, &nbsp;</i>£4.95 plus £1 p&p, shows how people adapt to change,whether on a farm, in a mine or in a forest. <p><i> Kumasi and Beyond, &nbsp;</i>£4.95,covers the vibrancy of town life, with its flourishing informal economy. Both publications, written by British teachers after a DEC study visit toGhana, include case studies and personal histories.<p>  <i>Issues and enquiry, &nbsp;</i>£12.00, plus £1.20 VAT and £2.40 p&p, offers adviceand resources for teaches and a photo-pack for classroom use.

<h1 align=center>Foundation launches second literary award</h1>


Next year you should listen for the award-winning Commonwealth short stories being
broadcast on your national radio station.  And if you are a writer, established or aspiring,
please send in your story now - you could win £2,000!<p>


The Commonwealth Foundation, in collaboration with the Commonwealth Broadcasting
Association (CBA), is launching a new Commonwealth Short Story Competition in 1996.  
National radio stations are currently soliciting entries of original five-minute short stories,
which will be initially screened by the CBA.  Then a small international panel of three judges
will meet in London in April 1996 to make the final selection.  They will choose one overall
winner, three regional winners and 22 commended writers.  The recordings of the 26 winning
stories will be available for free distribution to all radio stations in the Commonwealth.<p>


The Foundation and the CBA are delighted to be co-operating on this new joint project.  If
successful, the Commonwealth Short Story Competition could become a companion award to
the Commonwealth Writers Prize.  It will be another exciting means of celebrating the
richness of the English language which is the main common bond of the Commonwealth.<ul>


<b>Prizes:</b><p>
First prize:  £2,000<br>
Three regional prizes:  £500 each<br>
Twenty-two commended writers:  £100 each<p>

<h3>Commonwealth Writers Prize 1995</h3><img align=right width=200 height=193 hspace=10 vspace=10
border=1 src="comm_pix/louis_bernieres.jpg">

Third time really was lucky for Louis de Bernieres, winner of the £10,000 Commonwealth
Writers Prize in 1995 and the first British novelist to take the award.  Two of his previous
books had been shortlisted for the Prize, but this year his novel, Captain Corelli's Mandolin,
won universal acclaim from the judges as a major contribution to the literature of war.  Set on
an occupied Greek island during the Second World War, it has a large and colourful cast of
characters who are protrayed both comically and tragically.  The international panel of judges
were dazzled by its energy, humanity and humour.<p>


The £3,000 prize for the best first published book was awarded to Adib Khan, a writer of
Bangladeshi origin now settled in Australia, for his novel Seasonal Adjustments.<p>


Louis de Bernieres was granted the customary audience with H M the Queen on 26 October
and afterwards the Foundation hosted a champagne reception for him in London.  To his great
disappointment he had been unable to attend the gala awards dinner in Harare, but he sent a
statement to be read on that occasion.
Here is an extract from his testimony to the Commonwealth Writers Prize:<p>
<ul>

<i>I am deeply honoured to be on the Commonwealth Writers Prize List, because I believe in the
Commonwealth and I believe in the Commonwealth Writers Prize.  The Commonwealth is a
splendid and improbable institution.  Never before has an empire been dissolved, with the
formerly subject nations choosing to remain fraternal both with each other and with the
former colonisers.  This is a perfectly unique phenomenon, and I am not even sure that it is
explicable.  To the modern mind the whole concept of empire seems both immoral and
pointless, and yet here we are, united by forgiveness, mutual affection, fraternity, and the
strange compromises and accommodations of a shared history.  We have picked up each
others' cuisine, habits and customs, and the English language has greedily nourished itself by
appropriating words and idioms from the hundreds of Commonwealth tongues.  We have
enough in common to be friends who understand each other, and enough diversity to keep us
mutually interesting.<p>


This diversity is the reason for the special status of the Commonwealth Writers Prize...  This
prize is judged by intellectuals, academics, and serious booklovers from all around the world,
from dozens of different cultures and traditions.  Thankfully these judges are uninfluenced by
the bizarre and fatuous literary fashions that are the curse of Europe, and therefore to be
chosen for the shortlist must mean that a writer has managed to come up with something
quintessential, something that transcends cultural differences and resonates in the universal
human heart.  To be on the shortlist is to be reassured that one has written a real book, and
there is truly no other prize of which this can be so confidently said.  Long may it prosper,
and my congratulations go to all of my fellow prizewinners.  To all those in the
Commonwealth who are writing in English even though it is their second or third language, I
wish to offer my special thanks.  I know that there is much heated debate about whether one
should rather write in one's mother tongue, but I am very selfishly grateful that so many do in
fact write in English; to these I say thank you for enriching and extending my language, thank
you for making your world accessible to me, and thank you for being the ones who keep the
flame alight.</i></ul><p>


<h4>Tribute to Ken Saro-Wiwa: <br>
former regional winner of the Commonwealth Writers Prize</h4>

Ken Saro-Wiwa, besides being a courageous campaigner for the rights of his people, was one
of the first two regional winners of the Commonwealth Writers Prize in Africa for his
collection of short stories, A Forest of Flowers.  Ironically, it was because the flowers were
withering in Ogoniland, killed off by the pollution from the oil rigs and the neglect of the
government, that Ken Saro-Wiwa, a committed nationalist, took up the cudgels on behalf of
the Ogoni people.<p>


In a moving plea for Ken Saro-Wiwa's life, shortly after his friend had been sentenced to
death, another Nigerian writer (and coincidentally the other winner of the regional award for
Africa in the Commonwealth Writers Prize 1987), Ben Okri, argued that writers are the
barometers of a nation's health.  Ken Saro-Wiwa himself, in the final television interview he
gave before being imprisoned, explained that African writers had no time to deal with
personal angst.  They had to tackle the burning issues of the day, they had to be combative.<p>


Alas, Ken Saro-Wiwa's fighting spirit led him to an untimely grave and his execution, along
with eight Ogoni colleagues, and contributed towards the two-year suspension of Nigeria
from the Commonwealth.

Le Bulletin DPMN, publi&#233; pour la premi&#232;re fois en novembre 1992, se propose de favoriser
la communication entre les sp&#233;cialistes de la gestion des politiques de d&#233;veloppement.
<p>

Le magazine, lanc&#233; avant m&#234;me la mise en place du r&#233;seau pour donner un exemple
concret du but de ce dernier, est un forum dans lequel les acteurs du d&#233;veloppement peuvent
&#233;tudier les difficult&#233;s que posent la formulation et la mise en oeuvre de politiques et se
concerter sur des solutions. Mme Corkery estime que leurs exp&#233;riences sont sens&#233;es
stimuler une recherche op&#233;rationnelle qui sera r&#233;percut&#233;e aux d&#233;cideurs et
aux administrateurs.
<p>

Le Bulletin DPMN para&#238;t trois fois par an, en anglais et en fran&#231;ais. Chaque num&#233;ro porte

Dans sa vie br&#232;ve, le Bulletin DPMN s'est impos&#233; comme outil de communication et source
d'information pour les chercheurs et tous ceux qui travaillent &#224; la formulation et &#224; la
gestion de politiques de d&#233;veloppement. Le processus adopt&#233;, interaction de diverses
personnes rassemblant des disciplines, des exp&#233;riences et des nationalit&#233;s
diff&#233;rentes, s'est r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; fructueux en id&#233;es et ad&#233;quat pour la

par <I>Stanley Please</I>
<P>
Texte int&eacute;gral d'un article paru dans le <I>Bulletin DPMN,
2(1) avril 1994: page 2 </CENTER></I><HR>

<P>
La gestion des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement a &eacute;t&eacute;
d&eacute;finie cette derni&egrave;re d&eacute;cennie comme sujet
d'&eacute;tude afin que soit abord&eacute;e la question de savoir
<I>comment </I>les politiques sont formul&eacute;es et mises en
oeuvre, par opposition &agrave; la question de savoir <I>quelles
</I>sont les politiques &agrave; poursuivre. Le th&egrave;me de
la coop&eacute;ration et de l'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionales
en Afrique demande assur&eacute;ment une &eacute;tude dans ce
contexte.
<P>
Actuellement presque tout le monde reconna&icirc;t les avantages
que pr&eacute;senterait l'accroissement de la coop&eacute;ration
et de l'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionales en tant qu'objectif
politique. M&ecirc;me la Banque mondiale, au d&eacute;part sceptique,
voire hostile, marque d&eacute;sormais son soutien. Toutefois,
les partisans les plus pers&eacute;v&eacute;rants et les plus
enthousiastes d'une plus grande coop&eacute;ration, aussi bien
en tant que but politique que comme moyen de stimuler la croissance
&eacute;conomique, sont d&eacute;courag&eacute;s par les r&eacute;sultats
obtenus depuis l'ind&eacute;pendance. La question cruciale n'est
donc plus <I>quel </I>est l'objectif &agrave; atteindre, mais
bien <I>comment </I>atteindre cet objectif.
<P>
Le message g&eacute;n&eacute;ral qui &eacute;mane des articles
de la pr&eacute;sente &eacute;dition du Bulletin est le suivant:
les d&eacute;cisions du haut vers le bas provenant des institutions
r&eacute;gionales ne repr&eacute;senteront gu&egrave;re plus que
l'affectation de politiciens et les pieux espoirs des bureaucrates
r&eacute;gionaux, &agrave; moins de proc&eacute;der &agrave; une
adaptation des institutions nationales et des processus administratifs,
de fa&ccedil;on &agrave; garantir l'int&eacute;gration des politiques
et des programmes r&eacute;gionaux dans les prises de d&eacute;cisions
nationales, c'est-&agrave;-dire, &agrave; moins que ce processus
ne devienne aussi un processus du bas vers le haut.
<P>
Mais les collaborateurs ne gonflent pas le r&eacute;cit des tribulations
de la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale. Au contraire, des histoires
de r&eacute;ussite limit&eacute;e et mitig&eacute;e sont rapport&eacute;es
d'Afrique australe (Goodison et Nee), d'Afrique de l'Ouest (Deme)
et de l'initiative transfrontali&egrave;re en Afrique orientale,
en Afrique australe et dans l'Oc&eacute;an Indien (Mansoor). Elles
ont toutes demand&eacute; l'engagement effectif d'acteurs du bas
vers le haut -- des minist&egrave;res nationaux, des organismes
publics, du secteur priv&eacute;. C'est &eacute;galement la le&ccedil;on
qui est retir&eacute;e de l'exp&eacute;rience non-africaine, repr&eacute;sent&eacute;e
dans le pr&eacute;sent Bulletin par le rapport de Stronck sur
l'exp&eacute;rience du Luxembourg, en sa qualit&eacute; de membre
de divers organismes r&eacute;gionaux europ&eacute;ens.
<P>
Mais par-del&agrave; leur importance pour le d&eacute;bat sur
la coop&eacute;ration et l'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionales
dont les articles parlent d'eux-m&ecirc;mes, ces articles soul&egrave;vent
&eacute;galement des th&egrave;mes plus larges relatifs au contenu
et &agrave; la m&eacute;thodologie de la gestion des politiques
de d&eacute;veloppement en tant que sujet d'&eacute;tude. Deux
th&egrave;mes pr&eacute;sentent une importance toute particuli&egrave;re
dans ce cadre.
<P>
Le premier point, fortement d&eacute;velopp&eacute; par Senghor,
est que le d&eacute;veloppement institutionnel en tant que partie
de la gestion des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement doit &ecirc;tre
consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme un 'processus'. Il faut reconna&icirc;tre
que les gouvernements ne disposent que d'une capacit&eacute; politique
limit&eacute;e dans une p&eacute;riode de temps donn&eacute;e
pour aborder les probl&egrave;mes politiques majeurs, que les
structures et les processus administratifs ne pourront &ecirc;tre
modifi&eacute;s que progressivement au fil du temps, et que la
soci&eacute;t&eacute; de mani&egrave;re plus g&eacute;n&eacute;rale
n'a qu'une capacit&eacute; ou une volont&eacute; limit&eacute;e
de s'adapter aux changements de l'environnement politique et institutionnel
au sein duquel vivent et fonctionnent les entreprises, les exploitants
agricoles, les travailleurs, les consommateurs, et d'autres op&eacute;rateurs.
Ainsi, puisque tout ne peut se faire imm&eacute;diatement, le
probl&egrave;me politique crucial est de r&eacute;partir les actions
en 's&eacute;quences'.
<P>
A l'importance accord&eacute;e &agrave; la r&eacute;partition
s&eacute;quentielle dans l'&eacute;tude du d&eacute;veloppement
institutionnel correspondent les faits survenus dans l'&eacute;tude
de la r&eacute;forme des politiques &eacute;conomiques. L'attention
se porte d&eacute;sormais moins sur les objectifs et le contenu
des programmes de r&eacute;forme. Il n'est plus beaucoup de doute
sur l'importance des macro-politiques financi&egrave;res disciplin&eacute;es,
des march&eacute;s et des prix d'un secteur priv&eacute; actif
et d'un secteur public plus efficace, de programmes destin&eacute;s
&agrave; aider les pauvres et &agrave; d&eacute;velopper les ressources
humaines. Aujourd'hui, nous sommes tous devenus des ajusteurs
structurels!
<P>
Au lieu de cela, les sp&eacute;cialistes et les d&eacute;cideurs
politiques mettent l'accent sur la rapidit&eacute; et la r&eacute;partition
s&eacute;quentielle des mesures de r&eacute;forme. Les fonds pour
les services de ressources humaines peuvent-ils &ecirc;tre modifi&eacute;s
avant que les consolidations de production de l'&eacute;conomie
n'aient &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;form&eacute;es et stimul&eacute;es?
Les entreprises publiques non rentables doivent-elles &ecirc;tre
liquid&eacute;es ou vendues avant que n'aient &eacute;t&eacute;
mises en place les conditions requises pour &eacute;tablir les
entreprises du secteur priv&eacute;? Il convient d'y ajouter toute
une s&eacute;rie de questions sur la r&eacute;partition s&eacute;quentielle.
<P>
L'article de Senghor appelle la question de savoir si le sujet
de l'administration publique a engendr&eacute; un quelconque cadre
conceptuel comparable sur lequel fonder le th&egrave;me en &eacute;mergence
de la gestion des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement. Ou alors
la tendance a-t-elle &eacute;t&eacute; de se concentrer sur les
structures institutionnelles et les processus administratifs 'id&eacute;aux'
ou 'optimaux', aux d&eacute;pens du processus permettant d'atteindre
ces objectifs?
<P>
Le deuxi&egrave;me th&egrave;me conceptuel pr&eacute;sentant de
l'importance pour l'avancement de la gestion des politiques de
d&eacute;veloppement comme sujet &agrave; part enti&egrave;re
au sein des sciences sociales est le besoin de retirer des hypoth&egrave;ses
provisoires des &eacute;tudes historiques et descriptives et de
tester &agrave; leur tour ces hypoth&egrave;ses par rapport &agrave;
d'autres &eacute;tudes d'exp&eacute;rience. Par exemple:
<P>
Aucun changement des dispositions institutionnelles ne pourra
faire avancer la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale de mani&egrave;re
efficace sans la participation de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile.
<P>
Dans l'envahissante situation africaine de gestion de crise de
la politique &eacute;conomique, aucune modification institutionnelle
ou politique ne permettra d'atteindre les objectifs &agrave; plus
long terme de la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale si les bailleurs
de fonds ne se montrent pas d&eacute;cid&eacute;s &agrave; supporter
les frais &agrave; court terme et &agrave; compl&eacute;ter les
capacit&eacute;s administratives locales.
<P>
Aucun ajout majeur et important au niveau qualitatif apport&eacute;
aux objectifs gouverne- mentaux (par exemple coop&eacute;ration
r&eacute;gionale, objectifs relatifs &agrave; l'environnement,
r&ocirc;le des femmes) ne pourra &ecirc;tre imm&eacute;diatement
int&eacute;gr&eacute; dans la bureaucratie existante de prise
de d&eacute;cision et de mise en oeuvre des politiques; il faudra
au contraire une annexe s&eacute;par&eacute;e et bien &eacute;tablie
&agrave; cette bureaucratie.
<P>
Ces hypoth&egrave;ses et questions ou d'autres similaires devraient
peut-&ecirc;tre faire l'objet d'autres articles qui suivraient
une trame diff&eacute;rente. Il faut cependant ajouter en toute
franchise que, &agrave; moins que l'exp&eacute;rience des sp&eacute;cialistes
et des praticiens ne puisse &ecirc;tre mise &agrave; profit pour
tester ces hypoth&egrave;ses et en soulever de nouvelles, le sujet
en &eacute;mergence de la gestion des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement
risque de ne pas acqu&eacute;rir de cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute;
en tant que discipline scientifique. Nul besoin que le sujet devienne
prescriptif -- et certainement pas arrogamment prescriptif comme
cela est trop souvent vrai de l'&eacute;conomie. Mais il ne peut
cependant plus se contenter de d&eacute;crire et de traiter chaque
cas comme un probl&egrave;me unique.<HR>

<H3>La coop&eacute;ration en Afrique: encouragement &agrave; l'action
au niveau des unit&eacute;s</H3>

<P>
par <I>Jeggan Senghor</I> 
<P>
Texte int&eacute;gral d'un article paru dans le <I>Bulletin DPMN,
2(1) avril  1994: pages 3 - 4 </CENTER></I><HR>

<H4>Introduction</H4>

<P>
Les ann&eacute;es 90 ont connu un regain d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
pour la coop&eacute;ration et l'int&eacute;gration en Afrique.
Toutefois, la politique et la recherche sur le sujet se concentrent
toujours de mani&egrave;re pr&eacute;dominante sur les th&egrave;mes
et les probl&egrave;mes li&eacute;s aux institutions et processus
r&eacute;gionaux 'du haut vers le bas'.
<P>
Et pourtant, la prise de d&eacute;cisions et la mise en oeuvre
des politiques et des programmes doivent in&eacute;vitablement
impliquer &eacute;galement un processus d'actions 'du bas vers
le haut' par les 'acteurs au niveau des unit&eacute;s'. C'est
ce que les gouvernements nationaux font qui d&eacute;termine effectivement
si oui ou non les &eacute;conomies peuvent mieux s'interconnecter
dans un cadre d'int&eacute;gration.
<P>
Il ne faut pas sous-estimer l'importance d'organisations r&eacute;gionales
telles que le PTA, la CEDEAO ou la SADC, ainsi que celle des nombreuses
autres institutions sous-r&eacute;gionales qui ont &eacute;t&eacute;
&eacute;tablies. Mais &agrave; moins que leurs d&eacute;clarations
ne s'accompagnent de changements politiques et institutionnels
parall&egrave;les au niveau national, elles ne vaudront gu&egrave;re
mieux que des platitudes politiques.
<H4>Priorit&eacute;s politiques</H4>

<P>
Depuis l'ind&eacute;pendance, et de plus en plus au cours de ces
quinze derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, les gouvernements africains
ont &eacute;t&eacute; confront&eacute;s &agrave; une s&eacute;rie
de probl&egrave;mes politiques et &eacute;conomiques hallucinants,
demandant tous des d&eacute;cisions politiques majeures. Dans
le domaine &eacute;conomique, les insuffisances reconnues des
strat&eacute;gies de d&eacute;veloppement de l'apr&egrave;s-ind&eacute;pendance
qui n'ont permis ni d'assurer la croissance &eacute;conomique,
ni d'am&eacute;liorer les conditions des pauvres, sont venues
s'ajouter &agrave; la d&eacute;gradation de l'environnement &eacute;conomique
global, si bien qu'il s'est av&eacute;r&eacute; essentiel que
les gouvernements accordent la priorit&eacute; &agrave; la gestion
de crise &agrave; court terme de leurs &eacute;conomies. La formulation
et la mise en oeuvre de macro-politiques disciplin&eacute;es dans
le cadre de programmes d'ajustement structurel ont &eacute;t&eacute;
la priorit&eacute; &eacute;crasante des gouvernements.
<P>
Les gouvernements africains, ainsi que les institutions financi&egrave;res
ext&eacute;rieures et les bailleurs de fonds qui les soutiennent,
ont pris progressivement conscience que le fait de s'attaquer
simplement aux priorit&eacute;s politiques &agrave; court terme
ne permettrait jamais de r&eacute;aliser les objectifs &agrave;
plus long terme du d&eacute;veloppement social et &eacute;conomique.
Il faut absolument inscrire le plus vite possible sur l'agenda
politique les probl&egrave;mes centraux du d&eacute;veloppement
des ressources humaines et des modifications technologiques dans
le domaine de l'agriculture et de l'industrie. Une plus grande
coop&eacute;ration et une plus grande int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionales
devraient &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre inscrites &agrave; l'agenda,
aussi bien en tant que fin politique souhaitable en soi, que comme
condition n&eacute;cessaire pour atteindre des niveaux plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s
de croissance &eacute;conomique et de d&eacute;veloppement.
<P>
S'il faut prendre un point de d&eacute;part pour aborder cet agenda
des probl&egrave;mes &agrave; long terme, notamment la coop&eacute;ration
r&eacute;gionale, tous ceux concern&eacute;s par la gestion des
politiques de d&eacute;veloppement au sein des gouvernements,
des institutions de recherche, et autres, doivent exprimer clairement
des programmes d'action qui puissent refl&eacute;ter les besoins
en mati&egrave;re de priorit&eacute;s et qui soient en m&ecirc;me
temps cr&eacute;dibles au niveau politique. La perspective doit
&ecirc;tre celle d'un processus en marche, o&ugrave; des macro-politiques
ad&eacute;quates sont en place, mais constituent simplement l'arri&egrave;re-plan
sur lequel seront formul&eacute;s et mis en oeuvre les politiques
et les programmes destin&eacute;s &agrave; aborder les probl&egrave;mes
&agrave; long terme. Les mesures visant &agrave; promouvoir la
coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale doivent elles-m&ecirc;mes
&ecirc;tre introduites progressivement.
<H4>R&eacute;partition s&eacute;quentielle</H4>

<P>
Trois &eacute;tapes cons&eacute;cutives vitales en termes de politiques
nationales et de d&eacute;veloppement institutionnel national
s'av&egrave;rent actuellement n&eacute;cessaires dans le processus
s&eacute;quentiel visant &agrave; accro&icirc;tre la coop&eacute;ration
r&eacute;gionale.
<P>
<I>Institutions gouvernementales centrales</I>
<P>
La pr&eacute;cipitation depuis l'ind&eacute;pendance &agrave;
vouloir cr&eacute;er de nouvelles institutions au niveau r&eacute;gional
en vue de promouvoir l'accroissement de la coop&eacute;ration
a d&eacute;tourn&eacute; l'attention des exigences de la coop&eacute;ration
au niveau national. L'engagement politique des chefs d'Etat doit
se refl&eacute;ter dans les institutions gouvernementales nationales,
et cela tant pour des raisons d'identification institutionnelle
que pour des raisons d'efficacit&eacute; bureaucratique.
<P>
La pratique courante actuelle qui consiste &agrave; charger du
contr&ocirc;le de la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale une unit&eacute;
au sein du minist&egrave;re des Finances, des Affaires &eacute;trang&egrave;res,
ou encore du Commerce et de l'Industrie, ne constitue aucunement
une alternative efficace en comparaison avec la cr&eacute;ation
d'un minist&egrave;re s&eacute;par&eacute;. Cela ne permet pas
une reconnaissance bien &eacute;tablie du s&eacute;rieux de l'engagement
du gouvernement vis-&agrave;-vis de la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale.
<P>
Au niveau bureaucratique, cette pratique p&egrave;che par deux
c&ocirc;t&eacute;s. Premi&egrave;rement, les responsabilit&eacute;s
normales de ces minist&egrave;res ont tendance -- et cela se comprend
-- &agrave; dominer leurs activit&eacute;s et, par cons&eacute;quent,
seule une infime partie de leur temps et de leurs efforts est
consacr&eacute;e aux probl&egrave;mes de d&eacute;veloppement
r&eacute;gional. En outre, le personnel, les niveaux hi&eacute;rarchiques,
les formations et qualifications du personnel dans ces unit&eacute;s
minist&eacute;rielles ont tendance &agrave; &ecirc;tre bien inf&eacute;rieurs
&agrave; ce qu'ils devraient &ecirc;tre pour les rendre r&eacute;ellement
efficaces.
<P>
Deuxi&egrave;mement, les probl&egrave;mes r&eacute;gionaux d&eacute;bordent
fr&eacute;quemment les responsabilit&eacute;s sectorielles et
fonctionnelles des minist&egrave;res d'ex&eacute;cution. Et m&ecirc;me
s'ils peuvent &ecirc;tre trait&eacute;s par des comit&eacute;s
interminist&eacute;riels, ceux-ci se r&eacute;v&egrave;lent rarement
efficaces, &eacute;tant donn&eacute; que leur composition et leurs
pouvoirs sont restreints.
<P>
La solution &agrave; ces probl&egrave;mes serait de passer &agrave;
un &eacute;chelon sup&eacute;rieur et de former un minist&egrave;re
s&eacute;par&eacute; de la Coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale,
directement responsable vis-&agrave;-vis du chef de l'Etat et
dirig&eacute; par un ministre. Ce minist&egrave;re assurerait
l'int&eacute;gration des politiques r&eacute;gionales dans tous
les aspects de la politique nationale et assurerait leur mise
en oeuvre suivant les plans &eacute;tablis.
<P>
Le personnel devrait &ecirc;tre s&eacute;lectionn&eacute; en tenant
compte des besoins sp&eacute;cifiques de l'int&eacute;gration
r&eacute;gionale. Les membres du personnel seront &agrave; la
fois &eacute;troitement technocrates et en m&ecirc;me temps ils
adopteront de larges perspectives et une attitude multidisciplinaire
vis-&agrave;-vis du d&eacute;veloppement et de ses liens avec
les probl&egrave;mes r&eacute;gionaux. Ils continueraient &agrave;
travailler en comit&eacute;s interminist&eacute;riels et seraient
rattach&eacute;s dans de nombreux cas &agrave; une cellule des
principaux minist&egrave;res sectoriels.
<P>
Il faut souligner que l'alternative d'une unit&eacute; r&eacute;gionale
d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e n'est qu'un pis-aller. Elle impliquerait
l'&eacute;tablissement d'unit&eacute;s nationales de l'organisation
r&eacute;gionale dans chaque pays membre. Mais elle ne refl&eacute;terait
nullement le besoin d'une d&eacute;monstration visible de l'engagement
national vis-&agrave;-vis de la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale.
En outre, on peut difficilement penser qu'elle pourrait &ecirc;tre
accept&eacute;e comme partie int&eacute;grante du processus bureaucratique
national. Elle risquerait donc d'&ecirc;tre encore plus marginale
pour la d&eacute;termination des politiques gouvernementales que
ne le sont les unit&eacute;s au sein des minist&egrave;res existants.
<P>
<I>Implication d'op&eacute;rateurs &eacute;conomiques priv&eacute;s</I>
<P>
Si une plus grande coop&eacute;ration et une plus grande int&eacute;gration
&eacute;conomiques ont une signification r&eacute;elle, l'un des
r&eacute;sultats devra &ecirc;tre l'accroissement du commerce
de part et d'autre des fronti&egrave;res nationales, l'augmentation
des investissements et, &eacute;ventuellement, l'augmentation
de la circulation des travailleurs. On observe d&eacute;j&agrave;
une activit&eacute; &eacute;conomique transfrontali&egrave;re
consid&eacute;rable, qui refl&egrave;te dans certains cas des
liens historiques de commerce et de fourniture en main-d'oeuvre
remontant &agrave; plusieurs si&egrave;cles. Une partie de cette
activit&eacute; transfrontali&egrave;re est non officielle et
m&ecirc;me ill&eacute;gale, et ce souvent en r&eacute;action &agrave;
la distorsion des prix.
<P>
En &eacute;liminant ces distorsions au moyen de programmes de
recouvrement et d'ajustement, ces flux acquerront une signification
de plus en plus importante en termes &eacute;conomiques. Pour
les encourager, il faudrait non seulement assouplir les restrictions
transfrontali&egrave;res inutiles et on&eacute;reuses, mais aussi
introduire des tarifs, et autres taxes sur les importations et
les exportations, plus significatifs.
<P>
Par voie de cons&eacute;quence, la deuxi&egrave;me priorit&eacute;
sera d'&eacute;tablir des institutions permettant &agrave; des
op&eacute;rateurs &eacute;conomiques priv&eacute;s -- firmes industrielles,
exploitants agricoles, commer&ccedil;ants, entreprises de transport
-- de participer &agrave; la formulation et &agrave; la mise en
oeuvre de politiques capables d'engendrer cette croissance de
l'activit&eacute; &eacute;conomique transfrontali&egrave;re. Cela
doit &ecirc;tre un processus du bas vers le haut dans lequel sera
cr&eacute;&eacute; un environnement habilitant de prix, de politique
de taux de change, de politique fiscale, de cr&eacute;neaux porteurs,
de mise en place d'infrastructures, de cadre r&eacute;glementaire
l&eacute;gal, et d'institutions financi&egrave;res; cet environnement
incitera les entreprises priv&eacute;es &agrave; s'investir dans
la croissance des flux du commerce r&eacute;gional.
<P>
L'article de Mansoor figurant dans ce Bulletin a pour th&egrave;me
la mani&egrave;re dont le secteur priv&eacute; a &eacute;t&eacute;
int&eacute;gr&eacute; dans le processus d&eacute;cisionnel transfrontalier
en Afrique orientale et en Afrique australe.
<P>
<I>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile</I>
<P>
Il est d&eacute;solant de constater que les citoyens des pays
qui sont cens&eacute;s &ecirc;tre les b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires
ultimes de la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale ne sont pour
le moment que de simples spectateurs. Et pourtant, sans leur engagement
et leur soutien, il est &agrave; peine pensable que des progr&egrave;s
puissent &ecirc;tre faits. En effet, les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices
de la coop&eacute;ration se feront principalement sentir &agrave;
long terme. A court terme, ce sont les co&ucirc;ts et les concessions
accord&eacute;es aux autres membres d'une organisation r&eacute;gionale
qui ont tendance &agrave; pr&eacute;dominer. Si un gouvernement
doit continuer &agrave; soutenir politiquement des programmes
r&eacute;gionaux suffisamment longtemps pour voir appara&icirc;tre
les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices, il lui faudra disposer d'une large
base de groupes d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts &agrave; travers toute
la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile.
<P>
Etablir un &eacute;lectorat politique de soutien est donc une
condition n&eacute;cessaire pour assister aux d&eacute;veloppements
subs&eacute;quents de la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale.
Cela signifie dans un premier temps que les habitants et leurs
repr&eacute;sentants au sein des associations, des unions professionnelles,
des groupements d'exploitants agricoles, des groupes de femmes,
etc., ainsi qu'au sein des partis politiques devront &ecirc;tre
mieux inform&eacute;s sur les probl&egrave;mes r&eacute;gionaux.
Les gouvernements doivent faire preuve d'une plus grande volont&eacute;
de faire conna&icirc;tre les donn&eacute;es et autres informations
concernant la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale. En outre, ils
doivent encourager leurs propres fonctionnaires, ainsi que les
chercheurs externes, les journalistes, etc., &agrave; se lancer
dans des discussions analytiques et controvers&eacute;es sur les
probl&egrave;mes r&eacute;gionaux.
<P>
Cette attitude n'est pas synonyme d'une abdication du pouvoir
par le gouvernement. Les objectifs de d&eacute;veloppement &agrave;
long terme, tels que la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale, ne
pourront jamais &ecirc;tre atteints sans le pouvoir politique.
Mais, en m&ecirc;me temps, ces objectifs ne seront atteints de
mani&egrave;re durable que s'il existe des &eacute;lectorats et
des groupes de pression pour soutenir, encourager et inciter les
gouvernements &agrave; agir.
<H4>Conclusion</H4>

<P>
Si l'on veut enregistrer des r&eacute;sultats, la coop&eacute;ration
r&eacute;gionale en tant qu'objectif national cr&eacute;dible
doit se refl&eacute;ter plus fortement dans les institutions nationales.
En tant que processus s&eacute;quentiel, cet article a sugg&eacute;r&eacute;
trois priorit&eacute;s demandant une attention des plus imm&eacute;diates.
Non seulement ces priorit&eacute;s renforceront la base nationale
&agrave; partir de laquelle l'accroissement de la coop&eacute;ration
r&eacute;gionale sera possible, mais elles provoqueront &eacute;galement
une r&eacute;action en cha&icirc;ne en termes d'am&eacute;lioration
de l'efficacit&eacute; et du bon fonctionnement des institutions
r&eacute;gionales elles-m&ecirc;mes.<HR>

<H3>Lignes d'action pour des r&eacute;formes institutionnelles
au niveau national</H3>

<P>
par <I>Moustapha Deme</I>
<P>
Texte int&eacute;gral d'un article paru dans le <I>Bulletin DPMN,
2(1) avril 1994: pages 5 - 7</CENTER></I><HR>

<P>
Trois facteurs sont les principaux responsables du succ&egrave;s
limit&eacute; des tentatives de coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale
en Afrique et de l'&eacute;chec quasi total des tentatives plus
ambitieuses d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale: <P><UL><LI>
l'absence de volont&eacute; politique;</UL><UL><LI>
l'absence de coh&eacute;rence entre
les politiques r&eacute;gionales et nationales; et</UL><UL><LI>
l'inefficacit&eacute;
des organisations r&eacute;gionales.</UL>
<P>
Les deux premiers facteurs font l'objet de la pr&eacute;sente
&eacute;dition du Bulletin. Les d&eacute;cisions prises au niveau
r&eacute;gional par les chefs d'Etat et de gouvernement et les
ministres ont rarement &eacute;t&eacute; refl&eacute;t&eacute;es
dans des d&eacute;cisions au niveau national sous la forme de
lois et de r&egrave;glements. En fait, ces d&eacute;cisions nationales
sont souvent prises sans aucune r&eacute;f&eacute;rence aux d&eacute;cisions
r&eacute;gionales.
<P>
Cela montre non seulement le manque d'engagement politique vis-&agrave;-vis
des d&eacute;cisions prises au niveau r&eacute;gional, mais aussi
l'incapacit&eacute; d'&eacute;laborer les mesures institutionnelles
requises pour assurer le suivi et la gestion de ces d&eacute;cisions
r&eacute;gionales. A moins de s'attaquer &agrave; ces probl&egrave;mes,
l'objectif si souvent revendiqu&eacute; d'une plus grande coop&eacute;ration
et d'une plus grande int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionales ne sera
jamais plus qu'une assertion jamais suivie de faits.
<H4>Que faut-il faire? -- Cinq pistes d'action</H4>

<P>
<I>Implication plus intense de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile</I>
<P>
Dans de nombreux pays, les prises de d&eacute;cisions ont &eacute;t&eacute;
monopolis&eacute;es par des politiciens et des bureaucrates, sans
r&eacute;f&eacute;rence aux int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts de tous les
acteurs qui seront affect&eacute;s par leurs d&eacute;cisions.
Plus particuli&egrave;rement, les bureaucrates ont accapar&eacute;
la plus grande part des responsabilit&eacute;s politiques. Ils
se sont constitu&eacute;s en une caste qui contr&ocirc;le l'exercice
du pouvoir et qui contribue &agrave; l'&eacute;limination de toutes
les forces d'opposition. La classe politique d&eacute;pend d&eacute;sormais
des fonctionnaires lorsqu'il s'agit d'actions dans le domaine
de la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale. Mais pourtant, ces
fonctionnaires sont eux-m&ecirc;mes redevables de leurs actions
&agrave; leurs familles, leurs tribus, ou &agrave; d'autres groupes
sociaux qui s'opposent aux politiques qui menacent les droits
acquis, notamment ceux qui font progresser la coop&eacute;ration
r&eacute;gionale.
<P>
L'action institutionnelle nationale la plus fondamentale serait
par cons&eacute;quent la r&eacute;forme du processus politique,
de mani&egrave;re &agrave; assurer une plus grande d&eacute;mocratisation
du pouvoir. Il ne faut pas que les habitants se r&eacute;fugient
dans les secteurs non officiels du pays; au contraire, ils doivent
se reconna&icirc;tre comme partie int&eacute;grante de l'Etat
et de ses institutions, ainsi que des groupements r&eacute;gionaux
et sous-r&eacute;gionaux dont fait partie leur pays.
<P>
Cette participation de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile est n&eacute;cessaire
&agrave; l'&eacute;laboration de strat&eacute;gies et &agrave;
la prise de d&eacute;cisions importantes, de m&ecirc;me qu'&agrave;
leur mise en oeuvre. Un moyen d'aboutir &agrave; un engagement
plus intense des acteurs et des parties prenantes envers la coop&eacute;ration
r&eacute;gionale serait qu'ils constituent des associations ou
des groupements d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts pouvant agir comme groupes
de pression.
<P>
La formation de tels groupes peut &ecirc;tre per&ccedil;ue comme
faisant partie du processus &agrave; la base d'une plus grande
coordination et d'un plus grand dialogue entre la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
civile et le gouvernement et, de mani&egrave;re plus g&eacute;n&eacute;rale,
d'une plus grande d&eacute;mocratisation des pouvoirs.
<P>
<I>Am&eacute;lioration de la coordination administrative</I>
<P>
Les fonctionnaires responsables d'agences gouvernementales ont
tendance &agrave; travailler comme si ces derni&egrave;res &eacute;taient
ind&eacute;pendantes. Il est tr&egrave;s difficile dans ces conditions
d'assurer la coordination entre les divers services administratifs.
Ceci est particuli&egrave;rement important dans la politique de
coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale, o&ugrave; les agences nationales
doivent g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement abandonner leurs responsabilit&eacute;s
aux agences r&eacute;gionales.
<P>
Certains pays ont tent&eacute; de r&eacute;soudre ce probl&egrave;me
en &eacute;tablissant des institutions sp&eacute;ciales au niveau
national, charg&eacute;es de contr&ocirc;ler la mise en oeuvre
des accords r&eacute;gionaux. Par exemple, des commissions nationales
de la CEDEAO et du CILSS ont &eacute;t&eacute; mises en place
&agrave; cet effet dans leurs pays membres. Certains pays (ex.
le S&eacute;n&eacute;gal) ont essay&eacute; d'&eacute;tablir des
m&eacute;canismes de suivi plus efficaces en cr&eacute;ant un
minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale, alors
que d'autres (ex. le Mali) ont confi&eacute; la t&acirc;che au
minist&egrave;re des Affaires &eacute;trang&egrave;res, ajoutant
le terme 'Int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale' &agrave; l'appellation
du minist&egrave;re. Aucune de ces initiatives n'a cependant donn&eacute;
de r&eacute;sultats convaincants.
<P>
Une autre approche a &eacute;t&eacute; tent&eacute;e avec un certain
succ&egrave;s dans le cas de la politique de s&eacute;curit&eacute;
alimentaire. Cette approche consiste &agrave; s'attaquer d'abord
&agrave; la faiblesse nationale principale que constitue l'insuffisance
de coordination entre les d&eacute;partements du gouvernement.
On esp&egrave;re qu'un programme r&eacute;gional plus efficace
r&eacute;sultera de cette base administrative nationale (voir
encadr&eacute;).
<P>
<I>Accroissement de la d&eacute;centralisation administrative</I>
<P>
Les programmes d'ajustement structurel ont soulign&eacute; le
besoin de red&eacute;finir les relations &eacute;conomiques dans
le pays en accordant &agrave; nouveau le pouvoir &eacute;conomique
aux consommateurs individuels, aux exploitants agricoles, aux
entreprises, etc., au travers de m&eacute;canismes de march&eacute;.
Il existe un besoin parall&egrave;le de d&eacute;centraliser les
pouvoirs administratifs vers la base de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
en restructurant l'Etat dans le cadre du processus de d&eacute;mocratisation.
<P>
L'exp&eacute;rience montre le succ&egrave;s limit&eacute; remport&eacute;
par les nombreuses tentatives de d&eacute;centralisation. Ces
tentatives ont &eacute;t&eacute; adopt&eacute;es par l'&eacute;lite
administrative et ont eu pour effet d'accro&icirc;tre la m&eacute;fiance
de la population &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de l'Etat.
<P>
La solution serait une d&eacute;centralisation compl&egrave;te,
transf&eacute;rant un maximum de responsabilit&eacute;s aux autorit&eacute;s
sous-nationales, de m&ecirc;me que les capacit&eacute;s financi&egrave;res
et techniques requises pour assumer ces responsabilit&eacute;s.
Une telle d&eacute;centralisation permettrait d'am&eacute;liorer
les capacit&eacute;s de gestion &eacute;conomique et commerciale
des autorit&eacute;s frontali&egrave;res et des r&eacute;seaux
inter-&eacute;tats. Elle permettrait &eacute;galement d'am&eacute;liorer
les relations culturelles et sociales de part et d'autre des fronti&egrave;res
nationales, relations qui ont par ailleurs toujours &eacute;t&eacute;
tr&egrave;s fortes.
<P>
<I>Am&eacute;lioration des capacit&eacute;s d'information et d'analyse</I>
<P>
Prendre des d&eacute;cisions rationnelles est inconcevable sans
une bonne information sur les acteurs et les parties prenantes
dans la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale, sur les objectifs
et les strat&eacute;gies, sur les co&ucirc;ts et les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices
pour chaque groupe d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts et pour le pays en
soi, tant &agrave; court et moyen terme, qu'&agrave; long terme.
<P>
Il faut toutefois d&eacute;plorer l'absence de ce type d'information
au niveau national. L'information souffre de la concentration
des gouvernements nationaux sur la gestion de crise &agrave; court
terme et sur les probl&egrave;mes politiques purement nationaux.
Il n'existe par cons&eacute;quent aucune base ad&eacute;quate
permettant de passer du stade des accords r&eacute;ellement pris
lors de discussions au niveau r&eacute;gional &agrave; celui de
la mise en oeuvre de ces accords au niveau national.
<P>
Cette information et cette analyse ne devraient pas &ecirc;tre
g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;es par le fait unique des gouvernements.
Toutes les associations nationales, qui refl&egrave;tent les groupes
d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts qui pourraient sortir gagnants ou perdants
d'une plus grande coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale, doivent
&ecirc;tre mieux inform&eacute;es. Seulement ainsi, elles pourront
participer plus judicieusement &agrave; la discussion nationale
qui, comme il se doit dans toute d&eacute;mocratie, doit pr&eacute;c&eacute;der
les d&eacute;cisions qui seront prises par le gouvernement sur
les probl&egrave;mes politiques r&eacute;gionaux.
<P>
<I>Etablissement de proc&eacute;dures d'arbitrage et de suivi</I>
<P>
La prise de d&eacute;cisions d&eacute;pend du d&eacute;veloppement
des institutions et des processus destin&eacute;s &agrave; atteindre
des compromis entre des groupes d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts divergents
au niveau national. Ces n&eacute;gociations doivent avoir lieu
&agrave; plusieurs niveaux, avec des proc&eacute;dures it&eacute;ratives
permettant la ren&eacute;gociation des accords pr&eacute;c&eacute;dents.
<P>
Il est en outre n&eacute;cessaire d'&eacute;tablir des proc&eacute;dures
de suivi et de sanction pour garantir la mise en oeuvre des politiques
et des programmes conform&eacute;ment aux accords pris auparavant.
Des proc&eacute;dures d'arbitrage sont &eacute;galement n&eacute;cessaires.
<P>
<H4>Conclusion</H4>
<P>
Les points soulev&eacute;s ci-avant concernant la r&eacute;forme
institutionnelle au niveau national et visant &agrave; atteindre
l'objectif d'une plus grande coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale,
exigent que des responsabilit&eacute;s et des actions soient prises
au niveau le plus &eacute;lev&eacute; des administrations des
gouvernements membres, &agrave; savoir au niveau du Pr&eacute;sident
ou du Premier ministre conform&eacute;ment aux constitutions nationales,
et qu'il soit fait appel aux contre-pouvoirs classiques tels que
le parlement, les m&eacute;dias et la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile.
<P>
En outre, les cinq pistes pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es pour la r&eacute;forme
institutionnelle au niveau national ne pourront &ecirc;tre efficaces
que si elles sont accompagn&eacute;es d'une r&eacute;forme parall&egrave;le
du cadre institutionnel actuel au niveau r&eacute;gional. Il est
clair que les institutions r&eacute;gionales sont essentielles,
mais on pourrait tr&egrave;s certainement r&eacute;duire consid&eacute;rablement
leur nombre en augmentant leur efficacit&eacute;. Il serait en
fait possible d'accro&icirc;tre leur efficacit&eacute; &agrave;
assumer les fonctions d'information, d'analyse, de coordination,
de suivi, d'&eacute;valuation et de stimulation, si elles &eacute;taient
moins nombreuses. 
<P>
Enfin, un renforcement de ces institutions pour la coop&eacute;ration
r&eacute;gionale au niveau national pourrait vraisemblablement
avoir un impact b&eacute;n&eacute;fique sur l'efficacit&eacute;
et le bon fonctionnement des institutions au niveau r&eacute;gional.
C'est ce que l'on appelle un jeu gagnant.

<H3>Le Programme de gestion des politiques alimentaires (FPM) <BR>dans
la sous-r&eacute;gion Centre de l'Afrique de l'Ouest</H3>
<P>
par <I>Ad Oomen</I> 
<P>
Texte int&eacute;gral d'un article paru dans le <I>Bulletin DPMN,
2(1) avril 1995: page 6 </CENTER></I><HR>

<P>

La s&eacute;curit&eacute; alimentaire n'est plus consid&eacute;r&eacute;e
comme une pr&eacute;occupation exclusive des gouvernements nationaux.
Elle doit se concevoir dans un contexte r&eacute;gional. Le FPM
a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;tabli par les cinq gouvernements de
la sous-r&eacute;gion Centre de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (Burkina
Faso, C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali et Togo) et par ECDPM afin
de garantir l'int&eacute;gration des probl&egrave;mes r&eacute;gionaux
dans leurs politiques et leurs programmes nationaux.
<P>
Toutefois, il faut souligner que le FPM n'est pas un processus
destin&eacute; &agrave; adopter et &agrave; mettre en oeuvre des
politiques r&eacute;gionales au niveau national. Il n'existe en
r&eacute;alit&eacute; aucune politique r&eacute;gionale en tant
que telle. Au contraire, les prises de d&eacute;cisions rel&egrave;vent
toujours du niveau national. Mais l'on esp&egrave;re que gr&acirc;ce
au FPM les politiques nationales seront inform&eacute;es de mani&egrave;re
plus efficace et seront plus influenc&eacute;es par les exp&eacute;riences
et les probl&egrave;mes d'autres pays dans la sous-r&eacute;gion.

<P>
L'objectif ultime du FPM est donc de d&eacute;velopper une politique
de s&eacute;curit&eacute; alimentaire r&eacute;gionale con&ccedil;ue
plut&ocirc;t comme l'agr&eacute;gation des politiques et programmes
nationaux que comme une politique d&eacute;coulant d'une institution
r&eacute;gionale responsable des prises de d&eacute;cisions.
<P>
Le FPM se concentre moins sur le contenu des politiques que sur
le processus de formulation et de mise en oeuvre des politiques
dans le contexte sous-r&eacute;gional. Ce processus implique la
mise en place dans chaque pays d'une &eacute;quipe de d&eacute;cideurs
politiques (issue des minist&egrave;res de l'Agriculture, des
Finances et soit du Commerce, soit de l'Elevage) charg&eacute;e
d'assurer la coordination interd&eacute;partementale au niveau
national, ainsi que la cr&eacute;ation de relations effectives
avec les chercheurs, le secteur priv&eacute; et d'autres acteurs
concern&eacute;s dans le pays.
<P>
Ces &eacute;quipes nationales sont int&eacute;gr&eacute;es dans
un processus r&eacute;gulier et disciplin&eacute; de communication
et de consultation aux niveaux r&eacute;gional et sous-r&eacute;gional.
Ce processus englobe l'&eacute;laboration de documents de travail,
la mise sur pied d'ateliers nationaux et r&eacute;gionaux et la
tenue de r&eacute;unions pl&eacute;ni&egrave;res. Ce processus
permettra aux d&eacute;cideurs politiques d'&eacute;changer des
informations sp&eacute;cifiques tir&eacute;es de leur v&eacute;cu
professionnel.
<P>
C'est pourquoi l'on trouve au coeur m&ecirc;me du FPM le d&eacute;veloppement
des capacit&eacute;s pour la gestion des politiques alimentaires
au niveau national, y compris la cr&eacute;ation de relations
effectives avec tous les acteurs concern&eacute;s. Ces relations
constituent en effet une mise en r&eacute;seau des acteurs. Mais,
contrairement &agrave; beaucoup d'autres, ce r&eacute;seau est
orient&eacute; vers l'action et non simplement vers l'information.
C'est &agrave; partir de ces fondements plus robustes dans chaque
pays que l'on esp&egrave;re voir &eacute;merger une approche r&eacute;gionale
plus efficace vis-&agrave;-vis de la s&eacute;curit&eacute; alimentaire.

<H3>L'initiative transfrontali&egrave;re</H3>

<P>
par <I>Ali Mansoor</I> 
<P>
Texte int&eacute;gral d'un article paru dans le <I>Bulletin DPMN,
2(1) avril 1994: pages 8 - 9 </CENTER></I><HR>

<H4>Objectifs et histoire</H4>

<P>
L'initiative transfrontali&egrave;re (ITF) a pour but de faciliter
les investissements priv&eacute;s, le commerce et les paiements
entre les pays d'Afrique orientale, d'Afrique australe et de l'Oc&eacute;an
Indien qui sont membres du PTA, de la SADCC, et de l'IOC. On esp&egrave;re
ainsi amener ces groupes r&eacute;gionaux vers une plus grande
int&eacute;gration &eacute;conomique.
<P>
L'ITF a &eacute;t&eacute; lanc&eacute;e conjointement d&eacute;but
1992 par la Banque africaine de d&eacute;veloppement (BAD), la
Commission europ&eacute;enne (CE), le FMI et la Banque mondiale,
avec des fonds provenant des gouvernements des Etats-Unis, de
Suisse et du Canada. L'initiative refl&egrave;te les discussions
extensives qui ont eu lieu entre les co-sponsors, les institutions
r&eacute;gionales concern&eacute;es et les repr&eacute;sentants
des secteurs public et priv&eacute; de la plupart des Etats d'Afrique
orientale et d'Afrique australe (Burundi, Comores, Ethiopie, Kenya,
Madagascar, Malawi, Ile Maurice, Namibie, Ouganda, R&eacute;union,
Rwanda, Swaziland, Afrique du Sud (en qualit&eacute; d'observateur),
Tanzanie, Zambie, et Zimbabwe).
<P>
La premi&egrave;re phase se composait d'une &eacute;tude documentaire
proposant des termes de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence pour le travail
effectu&eacute; par les Groupes de travail technique (GTT) nationaux.
Les GTT ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;sign&eacute;s par les gouvernements
concern&eacute;s et comptaient un nombre &eacute;gal de repr&eacute;sentants
des secteurs priv&eacute; et public. La deuxi&egrave;me phase
a d&eacute;but&eacute; en juin 1992 &agrave; l'Ile Maurice, o&ugrave;
des repr&eacute;sentants des GTT de quinze pays finalis&egrave;rent
ces TDR. En novembre 1992, les repr&eacute;sentants des GTT pr&eacute;sent&egrave;rent
la synth&egrave;se de leurs diverses propositions dans un Programme
d'action commun (PAC) qui devait servir de base &agrave; un rapport
conceptuel. Ce rapport sugg&eacute;rait comment les gouvernements
pourraient mettre en oeuvre le PAC avec le soutien des bailleurs
de fonds et sous les auspices du PTA, de la SADCC et de l'IOC.
Le rapport conceptuel a &eacute;t&eacute; modifi&eacute; lors
d'une r&eacute;union des cadres officiels qui a eu lieu &agrave;
Bruxelles en juin 1993 et a ensuite &eacute;t&eacute; approuv&eacute;
sans aucune autre modification lors d'une r&eacute;union minist&eacute;rielle
en Ouganda en ao&ucirc;t 1993. En janvier 1994, le Kenya, le Malawi,
l'Ile Maurice, la Namibie, l'Ouganda, le Rwanda, et le Zimbabwe
ont invit&eacute; les co-sponsors &agrave; ouvrir des discussions
sur la mise en oeuvre.<P>
<H4>Aspects institutionnels et manag&eacute;riaux ayant contribu&eacute;
au succ&egrave;s de l'ITF</H4>
<P><UL><LI>
<B>Implication du secteur priv&eacute;</B>. D&egrave;s le d&eacute;part,
l'attention du secteur priv&eacute; s'est principalement port&eacute;e
sur les raisons entravant l'activit&eacute; &eacute;conomique
transfrontali&egrave;re. Cette participation active du secteur
priv&eacute; a permis de conserver le caract&egrave;re pratique
du train de r&eacute;formes propos&eacute;es, d'&eacute;viter
les pi&egrave;ges id&eacute;ologiques, et de contribuer &agrave;
vaincre certaines r&eacute;sistances initiales &eacute;manant
de certaines organisations r&eacute;gionales. A l'Ile Maurice,
par exemple, les repr&eacute;sentants du secteur priv&eacute;
ont demand&eacute; aux organisations r&eacute;gionales, d'une
part, de reconna&icirc;tre leur incapacit&eacute; &agrave; &eacute;liminer
les barri&egrave;res emp&ecirc;chant les transactions &eacute;conomiques
intrar&eacute;gionales priv&eacute;es et, d'autre part, d'apporter
leur soutien &agrave; l'ITF. La premi&egrave;re faiblesse a &eacute;t&eacute;
l'engagement insuffisant du secteur priv&eacute; international,
mais ce probl&egrave;me a &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;solu en instituant
un dialogue avec des organisations telles que le Groupe des Sept
et la Table Ronde europ&eacute;enne (organisations regroupant
des entreprises europ&eacute;ennes pr&ecirc;tes &agrave; contribuer
au d&eacute;veloppement de l'Afrique).</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
<B>Support local aux GTT</B>. L'enthousiasme initial des membres
individuels des GTT aurait pu s'att&eacute;nuer suite aux trop
grandes exigences pesant sur leur emploi du temps. Pour &eacute;viter
cet &eacute;cueil, un r&eacute;sident local a &eacute;t&eacute;
embauch&eacute; pour fournir les services de secr&eacute;tariat
au GTT. Ce consultant a &eacute;galement entrepris la recherche
r&eacute;clam&eacute;e par le GTT et assembl&eacute; divers documents,
y compris le rapport final. En sa qualit&eacute; de r&eacute;sident
local, le consultant a pu &ecirc;tre int&eacute;gr&eacute; dans
les structures du GTT, tout en &eacute;tant au fait des sensibilit&eacute;s
culturelles et politiques. En outre, le consultant &eacute;tant
responsable vis-&agrave;-vis du GTT et non vis-&agrave;-vis des
co-sponsors, tout travail &eacute;tait demand&eacute;, assimil&eacute;
et approuv&eacute; par le GTT. Le r&eacute;sultat refl&eacute;tait
donc le consensus du groupe et, dans la mesure o&ugrave; le GTT
a &eacute;t&eacute; choisi de mani&egrave;re repr&eacute;sentative,
un consensus social plus large. Un 'sp&eacute;cialiste' &eacute;tranger
soumettant les m&ecirc;mes recommandations n'aurait pas eu le
m&ecirc;me impact.</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
<B>Etablissement progressif du consensus</B>. Le fait d'avoir
demand&eacute; aux hommes d'affaires et aux hauts fonctionnaires
locaux de discuter dans les GTT des probl&egrave;mes et des solutions
envisageables a permis d'&eacute;tablir un consensus au niveau
national entre les agents &eacute;conomiques et les d&eacute;cideurs
politiques cl&eacute;s. En outre, les GTT forment un groupe de
pression embryonnaire visant &agrave; mettre en oeuvre le train
des r&eacute;formes n&eacute;cessaires recommand&eacute;es par
le groupe. Les participants locaux font prendre conscience de
domaines dans lesquels les r&eacute;formes doivent tenir compte
des sensibilit&eacute;s sociales et des goulots d'&eacute;tranglement
administratifs.</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
<B>Engagement de tous les acteurs -- nationaux, r&eacute;gionaux
et internationaux</B>. Les co-sponsors du d&eacute;part ont &eacute;t&eacute;
confort&eacute;s par un dialogue en profondeur avec les organisations
r&eacute;gionales et pan-africaines. Au niveau r&eacute;gional,
un dialogue en profondeur a &eacute;t&eacute; men&eacute; avec
les organisations r&eacute;gionales et pan- africaines dans le
but d'assurer l'acceptabilit&eacute; du train de r&eacute;formes
pour tous. Il est &agrave; noter que l'OUA et la CEA ont appuy&eacute;
l'ITF malgr&eacute; leur condamnation de la g&eacute;om&eacute;trie
variable en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral et de l'initiative UEMOA en
particulier. Ce r&eacute;sultat refl&egrave;te leur engagement
profond vis-&agrave;-vis du processus, de m&ecirc;me que les pressions
exerc&eacute;es par le secteur priv&eacute; sur le processus pour
en assurer le r&eacute;alisme et le pragmatisme. Les probl&egrave;mes
de fragmentation &eacute;conomique en Afrique fournissent une
base commune suffisante et un agenda suffisamment vaste pour que
soit attribu&eacute; un r&ocirc;le &agrave; toutes les organisations
concern&eacute;es.</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
<B>Un agenda &eacute;tabli par les parties les plus int&eacute;ress&eacute;es:
le secteur priv&eacute; en consultation avec le gouvernement</B>.
Le dialogue, l'&eacute;tablissement d'un consensus et la r&eacute;partition
des responsabilit&eacute;s constituent les bases de fondation
de l'ITF. Cette assimilation du processus a permis d'atteindre
un compromis entre les mesures consid&eacute;r&eacute;es comme
souhaitables par le secteur priv&eacute; et celles jug&eacute;es
comme politiquement possibles par le gouvernement. </UL>
<P><UL><LI>
<B>M&eacute;canismes et conventions de coordination flexibles
dans un cadre clairement d&eacute;fini</B>. Etant donn&eacute;
la grande diversit&eacute; des institutions nationales, r&eacute;gionales
et internationales, on aurait pu s'attendre &agrave; ce que la
coordination des efforts devienne un v&eacute;ritable cauchemar.
Il a donc &eacute;t&eacute; opt&eacute; pour une structure flexible
dont les principes g&eacute;n&eacute;raux ont &eacute;t&eacute;
&eacute;tablis par un petit comit&eacute; directeur (CD) dont
les membres ont &eacute;t&eacute; recrut&eacute;s parmi les co-sponsors.
Le CD a dirig&eacute; le processus et int&eacute;gr&eacute; les
r&eacute;actions et apports provenant de toutes les parties. De
l'&eacute;tude documentaire jusqu'au rapport conceptuel, cette
approche a &eacute;t&eacute; une r&eacute;ussite, et ce parce
que le noyau interne a su &eacute;valuer le terrain commun et
maintenir le consensus du groupe au moment de l'identification
et de l'&eacute;volution. Alors que les d&eacute;lais g&eacute;n&eacute;raux
et les grandes directions des r&eacute;formes ont &eacute;t&eacute;
identifi&eacute;s d&egrave;s le d&eacute;part, le CD a fait preuve
de flexibilit&eacute; en passant des TDR initiaux aux r&eacute;formes
recommand&eacute;es. A mesure que le processus approchait de la
mise en oeuvre, le CD prenait une forme plus pr&eacute;cise et
se dotait d'un agenda et d'un calendrier plus structur&eacute;s
pour ses propres actions.<P></UL>
<H4>Faiblesses du processus</H4>
<P>
Les principales faiblesses du processus sont communes &agrave;
tous les efforts de d&eacute;veloppement institutionnel; elles
ne sont pas n&eacute;cessairement li&eacute;es aux accords institutionnels
&eacute;tablis dans le cadre de l'ITF. Ces faiblesses sont essentiellement
dues au besoin de toute organisation de se fier &agrave; l'interaction
entre les personnes ayant chacune leur propre r&ocirc;le institutionnel.
Aborder ces probl&egrave;mes requiert une surveillance &eacute;troite,
dont une grande partie pourrait &ecirc;tre assur&eacute;e par
les secr&eacute;tariats du PTA, de la SADCC et de l'IOC. Malheureusement,
ces organisations ne sont pas structur&eacute;es pour assumer
ce r&ocirc;le. L'ITF pr&eacute;voit des fonds disponibles pour
les aider &agrave; assumer un r&ocirc;le de surveillance plus
important afin de pouvoir surmonter quelques-unes des insuffisances.
Parmi ces insuffisances, citons:
<P><UL><LI>
<B>Insuffisance d'assimilation</B>. L'ITF n'a r&eacute;ussi que
superficiellement &agrave; &eacute;tablir le consensus social
et institutionnel requis pour les r&eacute;formes n&eacute;cessaires.
Cela refl&egrave;te la difficult&eacute; tant d'assurer la bonne
diffusion des informations &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur m&ecirc;me
des organisations et entre les organisations, que d'assimiler
correctement ces informations. C'est pourquoi, de nombreux acteurs
finissent par repr&eacute;senter des positions aussi bien personnelles
qu'institutionnelles. Par exemple, bien que la Zambie tire de
grands avantages exclusivement des r&eacute;formes marginales,
ce pays a &eacute;prouv&eacute; des difficult&eacute;s &agrave;
d&eacute;velopper et &agrave; mettre en oeuvre une strat&eacute;gie
suite &agrave; un changement de Pr&eacute;sident du GTT. De la
m&ecirc;me mani&egrave;re, l'insuffisance des flux internes de
l'information ne permet pas aux unit&eacute;s cl&eacute;s des
minist&egrave;res concern&eacute;s d'&ecirc;tre suffisamment au
fait des implications de l'ITF. Bien que le Cabinet ait discut&eacute;
du rapport conceptuel et l'ait approuv&eacute;, de nombreux hauts
fonctionnaires semblent vouloir s'y conformer jusqu'&agrave; un
certain point et s'en &eacute;cartent d&egrave;s l'apparition
de probl&egrave;mes touchant directement leur domaine de comp&eacute;tences.
<P>
De plus, l'assimilation par les agences m&eacute;c&egrave;nes
a connu des difficult&eacute;s similaires. C'est en particulier
le cas pour le FMI et la Banque mondiale dont la culture institutionnelle
&eacute;prouve une aversion traditionnelle pour les mesures r&eacute;gionales
par opposition aux mesures multilat&eacute;rales, et compte tenu
&eacute;galement de l'organisation interne &eacute;tablie pour
traiter au cas par cas avec les gouvernements nationaux.</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
<B>Probl&egrave;mes en concurrence</B>. Une autre difficult&eacute;
est la faible attention que les d&eacute;cideurs politiques cl&eacute;s
accordent &agrave; cette probl&eacute;matique, &eacute;tant donn&eacute;
qu'ils doivent traiter d'autres probl&egrave;mes souvent plus
pressants. Par exemple, lors de la derni&egrave;re r&eacute;union
du Groupe consultatif pour le Kenya, la mobilisation pour le financement
du programme d'ajustement par les bailleurs de fonds a emp&ecirc;ch&eacute;
d'aborder l'ITF et son programme de r&eacute;formes &agrave; moyen
terme.</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
<B>Maintien du centre d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t et de la coh&eacute;rence</B>.
Lors de la mise en oeuvre du train de r&eacute;formes convenues,
il s'est av&eacute;r&eacute; difficile de maintenir le centre
d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t des d&eacute;cideurs. Le GTT est uniquement
un organe consultatif; en raison de l'insuffisance d'assimilation,
il n'a pas &eacute;t&eacute; ais&eacute; de mettre les r&eacute;formes
au programme de l'agenda des hauts d&eacute;cideurs. A cause de
cette faiblesse d'assimilation, l'approche d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e
n&eacute;cessaire (pays par pays) qui fait la force de l'ITF,
pourrait aussi bien s'av&eacute;rer &ecirc;tre son talon d'Achille.
Les d&eacute;cideurs politiques (et les bailleurs de fonds travaillant
avec eux) estiment qu'il est difficile, dans ce contexte, de voir
le lien entre les objectifs nationaux et les objectifs r&eacute;gionaux.</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
<B>Changement dans l'&eacute;quilibre des pouvoirs</B>. Les GTT
ont souvent &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;sign&eacute;s sans vraiment
croire que leurs recommandations filtreraient &agrave; travers
les d&eacute;cisions politiques nationales. Au fur et &agrave;
mesure que l'ITF vient &agrave; occuper la sc&egrave;ne centrale
qui doit &ecirc;tre prise en consid&eacute;ration par les d&eacute;cideurs
politiques, la pertinence et le r&ocirc;le des GTT &eacute;voluent.
Des rivalit&eacute;s internes pour qui repr&eacute;sentera les
diverses institutions aux GTT &eacute;clatent, et l'on tente m&ecirc;me
de contourner les GTT en instituant d'autres institutions. Cela
perturbe le processus et retarde le d&eacute;veloppement et la
mise en oeuvre du train de r&eacute;formes.<HR></UL>

<H3>Quelques le&ccedil;ons de l'exp&eacute;rience luxembourgeoise
</H3>

<P>
par <I>Gaston Stronck</I> 
<P>
Texte int&eacute;gral d'un article paru dans le <I>Bulletin DPMN,
2(1) avril 1994: pages 10 - 11 </CENTER></I><HR>

<H4>Contexte historique</H4>

<P>
Le Luxembourg est le membre fondateur d'un certain nombre d'organisations
internationales comme par exemple, le Benelux et l'Union europ&eacute;enne
(UE) dans le domaine &eacute;conomique, et l'UEO et l'OTAN dans
le domaine politique. L'impact de ces institutions r&eacute;gionales
sur le contenu des politiques nationales s'est accru de mani&egrave;re
consid&eacute;rable au cours de la derni&egrave;re moiti&eacute;
de ce si&egrave;cle, depuis la fin de la Deuxi&egrave;me Guerre
mondiale. Une des cons&eacute;quences en a &eacute;t&eacute; l'obligation
pour le Luxembourg d'&eacute;tablir des processus administratifs
tant officiels que non officiels, afin d'assurer sa participation
effective &agrave; la d&eacute;termination des politiques r&eacute;gionales
et &agrave; leur mise en oeuvre.
<P>
L'exp&eacute;rience luxembourgeoise n'est pr&eacute;sent&eacute;e
ni comme un mod&egrave;le, ni comme un ensemble de solutions applicables
dans d'autres pays. Il ne s'agit de rien d'autre que d'une exp&eacute;rience
parmi tant d'autres. D'autres pays pourront toutefois peut-&ecirc;tre
y trouver certains &eacute;l&eacute;ments d'exp&eacute;rience
int&eacute;ressants et utiles s'ils se trouvent confront&eacute;s
&agrave; des probl&egrave;mes similaires.
<H4>Impact sur la d&eacute;termination des politiques r&eacute;gionales
</H4>

<P>
Le potentiel de n'importe quel pays &agrave; contr&ocirc;ler,
voire influencer, la politique r&eacute;gionale sera limit&eacute;.
Il est &eacute;vident que de petits pays tels que le Luxembourg
p&egrave;seront probablement moins que des pays de plus grandes
dimensions. Il est toutefois possible de r&eacute;duire cette
contrainte si les gouvernements des petits pays montrent un engagement
r&eacute;el vis-&agrave;-vis des objectifs r&eacute;gionaux ou
s'ils jouent un r&ocirc;le actif dans la discussion et la d&eacute;termination
des politiques r&eacute;gionales en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral ou des
politiques dans lesquelles ils ont un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t particulier.
<P>
Ce qui amoindrit la capacit&eacute; de tout pays de peser sur
les politiques r&eacute;gionales, c'est l'incapacit&eacute; de
son gouvernement de se concentrer sur ce sujet parce qu'il se
pr&eacute;occupe quasi exclusivement des probl&egrave;mes politiques
internes ou parce qu'il doit faire front &agrave; une forte opposition
de la part des principaux groupes d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts nationaux.
<P>
L'impact d'un pays sur la politique r&eacute;gionale est &eacute;galement
fortement influenc&eacute; par la mesure dans laquelle son gouvernement
s'est organis&eacute; &agrave; cette fin. Ceci s'applique &agrave;
la formation d'une capacit&eacute; &agrave; entreprendre une analyse
politique, pour le d&eacute;veloppement de processus efficaces
de prise de d&eacute;cisions au sein du gouvernement, et aussi
pour la participation active aux prises de d&eacute;cisions r&eacute;gionales.
<P>
Ceci &eacute;tant pos&eacute;, une des conclusions g&eacute;n&eacute;rales
de cet article, que l'on peut anticiper d&egrave;s &agrave; pr&eacute;sent,
est que la gestion nationale des relations r&eacute;gionales ne
diverge pas de mani&egrave;re fondamentale de la gestion nationale
normale des affaires internes. Si le syst&egrave;me administratif
de gestion de la politique int&eacute;rieure ne poss&egrave;de
pas les qualit&eacute;s et les performances suffisantes, il est
peu vraisemblable qu'il se r&eacute;v&egrave;le plus apte &agrave;
g&eacute;rer la politique r&eacute;gionale. Pr&eacute;sent&eacute;
de mani&egrave;re plus positive, le pr&eacute;sent article conclut
&eacute;galement qu'une administration nationale bien organis&eacute;e,
efficace et motiv&eacute;e ne devrait avoir aucune difficult&eacute;
&agrave; g&eacute;rer la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale.
<H4>Analyse politique et prise de d&eacute;cisions politiques
</H4>

<P>
La facult&eacute; de participer efficacement &agrave; la prise
de d&eacute;cisions r&eacute;gionales d&eacute;pendra du travail
pr&eacute;paratoire ad&eacute;quat qui aura &eacute;t&eacute;
effectu&eacute; au sein de l'administration nationale, mais aussi
de l'efficacit&eacute; subs&eacute;quente des proc&eacute;dures
au sein de l'administration &agrave; aboutir aux d&eacute;cisions
politiques convenues sur les probl&egrave;mes r&eacute;gionaux.
Plusieurs facteurs sont importants &agrave; cet &eacute;gard:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Les fonctionnaires ne pourront travailler efficacement que s'ils
disposent de lignes directrices g&eacute;n&eacute;rales sur la
politique, qui seront d&eacute;finies au niveau politique le plus
&eacute;lev&eacute;.
</UL>
<P><UL>
<LI>La nette r&eacute;partition des responsabilit&eacute;s entre les
minist&egrave;res doit &ecirc;tre respect&eacute;e par les fonctionnaires.
Ceci est particuli&egrave;rement important si ces r&eacute;partitions
sont le fruit de n&eacute;gociations politiques &agrave; la base
de la formation de tout gouvernement de coalition.</UL>
<P><UL>
<LI>Un niveau &eacute;lev&eacute; de d&eacute;l&eacute;gation des
pouvoirs du niveau politique &agrave; l'administration.</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
La coh&eacute;rence de l'appareil administratif qui, &agrave;
son tour, exige un niveau &eacute;lev&eacute; de tradition et
de culture administratives. Bien entendu, cela ne peut &ecirc;tre
&eacute;tabli dans le court terme. Il s'agit d'un processus continu.
Mais ce processus n'est pas auto-g&eacute;n&eacute;rateur. Il
&eacute;mane de l'attention continue que lui accordent les gouvernements
et les cadres de la fonction publique agissant de mani&egrave;re
professionnelle. Cela n&eacute;cessite ensuite des actions d&eacute;termin&eacute;es
correctement &agrave; la lumi&egrave;re des exp&eacute;riences
accumul&eacute;es. </UL>
<P><UL><LI>
Une coordination, tant officielle que non officielle, bas&eacute;e
obligatoirement sur le flux des informations, est n&eacute;cessaire.
Les m&eacute;canismes officiels de coordination sont n&eacute;cessaires,
mais se r&eacute;v&egrave;lent parfois trop lents et trop pesants.
Il s'agit donc de souligner l'importance cruciale d'une coordination
non officielle et les fonctionnaires doivent &ecirc;tre form&eacute;s
et encourag&eacute;s &agrave; utiliser ces proc&eacute;dures informelles.</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
Lorsque l'effort de coordination ne parvient pas &agrave; d&eacute;boucher
sur un accord, un processus de r&eacute;glement des conflits internes
au moyen de m&eacute;canismes d'arbitrage cr&eacute;dibles est
n&eacute;cessaire.</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
Dans la mesure du possible, il devrait exister une similitude
entre les proc&eacute;dures administratives au niveau national
et au niveau r&eacute;gional.</UL>
<H4>Participation &agrave; la prise de d&eacute;cisions r&eacute;gionales
</H4>

<P>
Quel que soit le degr&eacute; d'efficacit&eacute; du travail analytique
et du processus de prise de d&eacute;cision au niveau national,
pour &ecirc;tre vraiment efficace, il faut avoir la capacit&eacute;
de n&eacute;gocier effectivement &agrave; l'&eacute;chelon r&eacute;gional.
Les facteurs suivants sont importants &agrave; cet &eacute;gard:
<P><UL><LI>
Il faut une excellente connaissance du contexte institutionnel
et proc&eacute;dural des organisations r&eacute;gionales. Par
exemple, pour un membre de l'Union europ&eacute;enne, savoir si
les d&eacute;cisions sont vot&eacute;es &agrave; la majorit&eacute;
ou s'il existe un droit de veto, est d'une importance capitale.
Si les d&eacute;cisions sont vot&eacute;es &agrave; la majorit&eacute;,
il se peut que des concessions et des compromis soient une solution
pr&eacute;f&eacute;rable plut&ocirc;t que de voir une d&eacute;cision
rejet&eacute;e faute de majorit&eacute; des voix. Au contraire,
un droit de veto conf&egrave;re en principe plus de pouvoir &agrave;
chaque pays et en particulier aux petits pays tels que le Luxembourg.
En pratique, un usage trop fr&eacute;quent de ce droit affaiblira
la bienveillance vis-&agrave;-vis d'un pays, nuisant ainsi &agrave;
ses propres int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts &agrave; long terme.</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
La qualit&eacute; des comp&eacute;tences et des techniques de
n&eacute;gociation des administrateurs nationaux est un atout
important. Les n&eacute;gociations r&eacute;gionales impliquent
des manoeuvres tactiques extensives et se concentrent de mani&egrave;re
sp&eacute;cifique sur des particularit&eacute;s techniques plut&ocirc;t
que sur les probl&egrave;mes de politique g&eacute;n&eacute;rale.
Les comp&eacute;tences des n&eacute;gociateurs individuels ne
varient pas tant d'un Etat &agrave; l'autre que d'un individu
&agrave; l'autre.</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
Efficacit&eacute; du travail en r&eacute;seau des fonctionnaires
se trouvant &agrave; l'interface entre les organismes nationaux
et r&eacute;gionaux. Chaque fonctionnaire devrait conna&icirc;tre
ses homonymes dans le syst&egrave;me r&eacute;gional. Au sein
de l'Union europ&eacute;enne, une participation r&eacute;guli&egrave;re
aux r&eacute;unions du Conseil et de la Commission facilite ce
processus.</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
D&eacute;veloppement de proc&eacute;dures efficaces pour relier
l'administration nationale et l'organisation r&eacute;gionale.
Il existe des diff&eacute;rences importantes dans la mani&egrave;re
dont les gouvernements tentent et sont capables de contr&ocirc;ler
leurs apports au syst&egrave;me de coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale.
Certains pays, tels que le Luxembourg, permettent &agrave; leurs
repr&eacute;sentants de travailler dans un cadre relativement
flexible. D'autres Etats ont tendance &agrave; se montrer peu
dispos&eacute;s &agrave; mener des n&eacute;gociations sur les
probl&egrave;mes politiques au-dessous du niveau minist&eacute;riel.
Au sein de l'Union europ&eacute;enne, la repr&eacute;sentation
permanente &agrave; Bruxelles doit jouer un r&ocirc;le cl&eacute;
et les m&eacute;canismes doivent &ecirc;tre sans cesse am&eacute;lior&eacute;s
au fur et &agrave; mesure que s'accro&icirc;t la charge de travail.</UL>

<H4>Mise en oeuvre des politiques r&eacute;gionales</H4>

<P>
Les d&eacute;cisions prises au niveau r&eacute;gional et qui ne
sont pas mises en oeuvre par la suite sont d&eacute;nu&eacute;es
de sens. Plusieurs facteurs sont importants &agrave; cet &eacute;gard:
<P><UL><LI>
L'engagement politique vis-&agrave;-vis des d&eacute;cisions r&eacute;gionales,
peut-&ecirc;tre au d&eacute;triment de d&eacute;tails plus 'techniques'.</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
La flexibilit&eacute; et la loyaut&eacute; des responsables de
la gestion de la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale vis-&agrave;-vis
des d&eacute;cisions au niveau administratif.</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
Des instruments et moyens ad&eacute;quats pour mettre en oeuvre
les d&eacute;cisions r&eacute;gionales. La mise en oeuvre des
r&egrave;glements et directives de l'Union europ&eacute;enne requiert
des comp&eacute;tences administratives idoines et, dans certaines
circonstances, des moyens financiers.</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
La coordination via un flux d'informations bien organis&eacute;.</UL>
<P><UL><LI>
La surveillance et le contr&ocirc;le syst&eacute;matiques et institutionnalis&eacute;s
de la mise en oeuvre, y compris la reconnaissance du calendrier
arr&ecirc;t&eacute; au niveau r&eacute;gional.</UL>
<H4>Conclusion</H4>

<P>
Dans le cas du Luxembourg, la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale
n'a entra&icirc;n&eacute; aucun changement majeur dans le style
de l'administration, le travail avec diff&eacute;rents &eacute;chelons
de centres de d&eacute;cisions autonomes faisant d&eacute;j&agrave;
partie int&eacute;grante de la vie quotidienne des fonctionnaires.
Une ouverture g&eacute;n&eacute;rale vis-&agrave;-vis des partenaires,
qu'ils soient gouvernementaux ou sociaux, de m&ecirc;me qu'une
pr&eacute;disposition &agrave; rechercher un consensus et &eacute;viter
les graves conflits, font partie du style administratif du Luxembourg
qui a pu facilement &ecirc;tre adapt&eacute; aux exigences de
la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale. Un niveau &eacute;lev&eacute;
des comp&eacute;tences et de l'exp&eacute;rience administratives,
notamment un niveau suffisant de flexibilit&eacute;, permet aux
administrateurs du Luxembourg d'assimiler les actes de la coop&eacute;ration
r&eacute;gionale.
<P>
En outre, les administrateurs sont amen&eacute;s &agrave; modifier
leurs processus institutionnels de par l'environnement dans lequel
ils travaillent, notamment par la direction politique, ainsi que
par les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts &eacute;conomiques et sociaux dans
la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale. Ces administrateurs ont
acc&egrave;s &agrave; l'information sur les probl&egrave;mes r&eacute;gionaux
et disposent de syst&egrave;mes de 'sanctions' tels que les tribunaux
ou l'opinion publique.
<P>
Ainsi, la motivation interne des administrateurs et l'environnement
dans lequel ils &eacute;voluent sont &agrave; la base d'une situation
dynamique qui garantit leur aptitude constante &agrave; assimiler
efficacement les nouveaux probl&egrave;mes r&eacute;gionaux.
<P>
Concluons l&agrave; o&ugrave; nous avons commenc&eacute;. Les
conditions n&eacute;cessaires aux institutions nationales pour
g&eacute;rer efficacement la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale
ne diff&egrave;rent pas de mani&egrave;re fondamentale de celles
requises pour g&eacute;rer les politiques int&eacute;rieures.
Une administration nationale bien organis&eacute;e, bien form&eacute;e
et bien motiv&eacute;e ne devrait avoir aucune difficult&eacute;
&agrave; g&eacute;rer la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale.

<H3>L'exp&eacute;rience de la SADCC</H3>

<P>
par <I>Paul Goodison et Bernadette Nee</I> 
<P>
Texte int&eacute;gral d'un article paru dans le <I>Bulletin DPMN,
2(1) avril 1994: pages 12 - 14 </CENTER></I><HR>

<H4>Contexte</H4>

<P>
Le syst&egrave;me de coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale fonctionnelle
&eacute;tabli par la SADCC au d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es 80
&eacute;tait fondamentalement diff&eacute;rent des m&eacute;canismes
de coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale dans le reste de l'Afrique.
Etant donn&eacute; les diff&eacute;rences d'id&eacute;ologie et
les confrontations politiques et militaires incessantes, la SADCC
s'est essentiellement concentr&eacute;e sur la coordination des
activit&eacute;s de d&eacute;veloppement dans un nombre limit&eacute;
de secteurs qui permettaient de retirer des avantages tangibles
des approches r&eacute;gionales. Les structures organisationnelles
et institutionnelles ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;centralis&eacute;es.
Ainsi, la coordination des programmes dans chaque secteur sp&eacute;cifique
a &eacute;t&eacute; confi&eacute;e aux diff&eacute;rents gouvernements
avec un Secr&eacute;tariat central de taille r&eacute;duite (voir
encadr&eacute;).
<P>
La SADCC a tent&eacute; d'organiser la coop&eacute;ration dans
les zones pr&eacute;sentant des avantages mutuels &eacute;vidents
pour au moins deux de ses neufs membres fondateurs et d'&eacute;viter
celles o&ugrave; la controverse risquait d'&eacute;clater et o&ugrave;
il deviendrait impossible de g&eacute;rer les pressions menant
&agrave; la dissolution organisationnelle.
<H4>Structures organisationnelles de la SADCC</H4>

<P>
D&egrave;s le d&eacute;part, une des pr&eacute;occupations majeures
a &eacute;t&eacute; d'&eacute;tablir des structures permettant
de renforcer la confiance mutuelle entre les divers gouvernements.
La cons&eacute;quence en a &eacute;t&eacute; que toutes les d&eacute;cisions
ont &eacute;t&eacute; prises &agrave; un niveau politique sup&eacute;rieur,
et ce sur la base d'un consensus. Depuis le d&eacute;but de la
SADCC, chaque d&eacute;cision a &eacute;t&eacute; prise lors des
r&eacute;unions au niveau des minist&egrave;res propres &agrave;
un secteur, ainsi que lors des r&eacute;unions des chefs d'Etat.
<P>
Ces r&eacute;unions ont re&ccedil;u l'appui d'une petite bureaucratie
centrale et d'un syst&egrave;me d'Unit&eacute;s de coordination
sectorielles (UCS) de niveau national assurant la liaison &eacute;troite
avec les Points de contact sectoriels (PCS) dans les gouvernements
de chaque Etat membre. Au niveau national, la coordination g&eacute;n&eacute;rale
des activit&eacute;s des divers PCS rel&egrave;ve de la responsabilit&eacute;
du Point de contact national (PCN) qui est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement
le minist&egrave;re des Finances ou de la Planification nationale.
<P>
La coordination de la mise en oeuvre des programmes convenus ne
rel&egrave;ve pas du Secr&eacute;tariat central, mais bien de
l'UCS du gouvernement responsable de la coordination dans ce secteur.
Cette structure fortement d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e, qui int&egrave;gre
activement chaque Etat membre dans un certain aspect de la coordination
r&eacute;gionale, a pour r&eacute;sultat que la majeure partie
du travail de la SADCC s'effectue en r&eacute;alit&eacute; au
sein de chaque Etat membre, via les UCS.
<P>
Cela signifie que dans les pays SADCC la qualit&eacute; de l'administration
nationale, ses connaissances, son exp&eacute;rience et sa motivation,
sont essentielles &agrave; la r&eacute;ussite de la coop&eacute;ration
r&eacute;gionale.
<H4>Le r&ocirc;le des Unit&eacute;s de coordination sectorielles
</H4>

<P>
Les UCS formulent, surveillent et modifient les composantes sectorielles
et de projet du programme d'action de la SADCC. Elles assurent
la liaison et la consultation avec les Etats membres de la SADCC
(via les PCS des minist&egrave;res nationaux) et les partenaires
coop&eacute;rants internationaux. Elles fournissent &eacute;galement
guidage et services techniques pour la mise en oeuvre des programmes
sectoriels. Une autre t&acirc;che importante des UCS est l'&eacute;laboration
de strat&eacute;gies sectorielles et la d&eacute;finition de crit&egrave;res
pour l'int&eacute;gration des projets dans le programme d'action.
Les UCS s'occupent &eacute;galement activement de l'identification
des projets, de leur s&eacute;lection, de leur &eacute;valuation
et de leur conception, en consultation &eacute;troite avec les
Etats membres dans lesquels se situe le projet. Les UCS peuvent
&eacute;galement apporter leur soutien lors des n&eacute;gociations
sur les financements et autres dispositions techniques.
<P>
Toutefois, les UCS, &agrave; l'exception des &eacute;tudes effectu&eacute;es
au niveau r&eacute;gional, ne sont pas impliqu&eacute;es dans
la mise en oeuvre effective des projets et des programmes, celle-ci
restant sous la responsabilit&eacute; des d&eacute;partements
nationaux concern&eacute;s du pays o&ugrave; les activit&eacute;s
seront d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es.
<P>
Non seulement la responsabilit&eacute; de la coordination des
activit&eacute;s dans les secteurs individuels est attribu&eacute;e
aux gouvernements individuels, mais les PCS de chaque pays assument
la responsabilit&eacute; principale de veiller &agrave; ce que
leurs int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts nationaux soient enti&egrave;rement
int&eacute;gr&eacute;s dans les programmes r&eacute;gionaux. En
effet, les PCS sont la pierre angulaire de la structure fortement
d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e de la SADCC.

<H4>Le r&ocirc;le des points de contact sectoriels </H4>

<P>
Etant donn&eacute; que les PCS sont la principale interface entre
les structures r&eacute;gionales de la SADCC et les gouvernements
nationaux, il est essentiel qu'ils comprennent clairement les
&quot;liens institutionnels entre l'administration nationale et
l'organisation de coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale&quot; (Stronck).
Alors que les responsabilit&eacute;s du PCS concernent aussi bien
l'&eacute;laboration de politiques sectorielles r&eacute;gionales
que l'administration et la mise en oeuvre du programme d'action
de la SADCC, il n'est pas toujours clair o&ugrave; finissent les
responsabilit&eacute;s du PCS et o&ugrave; commencent celles de
l'UCS. De la m&ecirc;me mani&egrave;re, les PCS ne sont pas toujours
coutumiers de ce que l'on peut attendre de mani&egrave;re r&eacute;aliste
de l'UCS, comment leur donner suite et qui au sein de cette unit&eacute;
est charg&eacute; des domaines pr&eacute;sentant un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
particulier pour un PCS.
<P>
Tandis que l'initiative destin&eacute;e &agrave; faire progresser
la formulation des politiques sectorielles r&eacute;gionales est
du ressort des UCS, se conformant &agrave; la direction politique
d&eacute;finie par le Conseil des ministres comp&eacute;tent,
les apports nationaux fournis par les PCS dans chaque administration
nationale constituent la base sur laquelle repose la direction
politique et sont le reflet critique des propositions sp&eacute;cifiques
&eacute;manant des UCS.
<P>
En ce qui concerne l'&eacute;tablissement et la mise en oeuvre
du programme d'action &agrave; base de projet, les PCS au sein
des administrations nationales assument un certain nombre de fonctions
importantes. Parmi ces fonctions, citons: la soumission des projets
&agrave; l'UCS aux fins de les int&eacute;grer dans le programme
d'action, le suivi &agrave; l'UCS, la garantie du financement
pour la mise en oeuvre des projets, la compilation et la distribution
des rapports sur l'&eacute;tat d'avancement des projets &agrave;
l'UCS, la fourniture, en association avec le PCN, d'apports nationaux
aux exercices de programmation avec les partenaires coop&eacute;rants
individuels, et le briefing des d&eacute;l&eacute;gations minist&eacute;rielles.
<P>
En termes de collecte de fonds et de mise en oeuvre des projets
et des programmes dans le programme d'action de la SADCC, la responsabilit&eacute;
rel&egrave;ve principalement du PCS o&ugrave; se situe physiquement
la mise en oeuvre du projet dans un Etat membre. Ceci est d'une
importance capitale si l'on consid&egrave;re les accords administratifs
de coop&eacute;ration de la SADCC pass&eacute;s avec les agences
de financement externes.
<P>
Les PCS ne comprennent pas toujours le fait que la responsabilit&eacute;
principale de la collecte des fonds pour les projets se situent
physiquement entre les mains du PCS (et des autres d&eacute;partements
gouvernementaux comp&eacute;tents en mati&egrave;re de mobilisation
des ressources externes) au sein du pays concern&eacute; par ce
projet. L'&eacute;tendue de la coop&eacute;ration et de la consultation
avec, d'une part, l'UCS et, d'autre part, les organismes nationaux
responsables de la mobilisation des ressources externes, n'est
pas non plus toujours bien comprise par les PCS.
<P>
Il en r&eacute;sulte que, parmi leurs six fonctions identifi&eacute;es
ci-avant, les PCS ne comprennent bien souvent clairement que leur
responsabilit&eacute; quant &agrave; la soumission des projets
et l'&eacute;tablissement de rapports &agrave; l'intention des
UCS.
<P>
Ceci d&eacute;montre l'importance pour l'administration nationale
(parmi les divers PCS) d'une connaissance d&eacute;taill&eacute;e
du contexte institutionnel et proc&eacute;dural officiel de la
SADCC et de son mode de fonctionnement dans les diverses administrations
nationales.
<P>
Un autre probl&egrave;me majeur rencontr&eacute; au niveau national
est la difficult&eacute; de garantir le flux d'informations et
de faire comprendre aux hauts fonctionnaires du minist&egrave;re
d'ex&eacute;cution, concern&eacute;s par la mise en oeuvre effective
des projets faisant partie du programme d'action de la SADCC,
les r&ocirc;les exacts des diff&eacute;rentes structures de la
SADCC.
<P>
Cela souligne un autre point soulev&eacute; par Stronck dans son
approche des conventions nationales institutionnelles pour la
gestion de la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale, &agrave; savoir
l'importance de la coordination, tant officielle que non officielle,
pour garantir que les informations circulent et servent de base
&agrave; l'action.
<P>
La coordination informelle fait souvent quelque peu d&eacute;faut
au sein du syst&egrave;me de la SADCC au niveau national, en partie
parce que la r&eacute;partition des responsabilit&eacute;s dans
l'administration nationale n'est pas clairement comprise par les
divers acteurs nationaux concern&eacute;s par la SADCC. Comme
l'a fait remarquer Stronck, cette nette r&eacute;partition des
responsabilit&eacute;s est importante pour garantir un engagement
national effectif dans des activit&eacute;s r&eacute;gionales.
<p>

<H4>Le r&ocirc;le des points de contact nationaux</H4>

<P>
La responsabilit&eacute; du PCN de r&eacute;unir les perspectives
nationales sur les d&eacute;bats politiques en cours dans la SADCC
rev&ecirc;t &agrave; l'heure actuelle une importance toute particuli&egrave;re,
&eacute;tant donn&eacute; la transition en cours vers une Communaut&eacute;
de d&eacute;veloppement. Le PCN joue un r&ocirc;le central en
veillant &agrave; ce que l'Etat membre tire pleinement profit
des programmes r&eacute;gionaux de la SADCC et &agrave; ce que
le d&eacute;veloppement politique r&eacute;gional soutienne les
objectifs g&eacute;n&eacute;raux &eacute;tablis au niveau national
en mati&egrave;re de d&eacute;veloppement social et &eacute;conomique.
<P>
Certains pays de la SADCC sont confront&eacute;s &agrave; un probl&egrave;me
d'auto-perception du r&ocirc;le du PCN, consid&eacute;r&eacute;
comme limit&eacute; &agrave; la participation &agrave; la Conf&eacute;rence
consultative annuelle de la SADCC. Dans certains cas, le PCN ne
se sent nullement charg&eacute; de garantir la coh&eacute;rence
entre les politiques nationales et r&eacute;gionales, ni de coordonner
les activit&eacute;s des PCS, ni de veiller &agrave; ce qu'ils
assument leurs responsabilit&eacute;s r&eacute;gionales.
<P>
A moins de renforcer le r&ocirc;le principal du PCN au niveau
national et de r&eacute;soudre les probl&egrave;mes de coordination
interne entre le PCN, le PCS et m&ecirc;me les points de contact
sous-sectoriels, la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale sera probablement
consid&eacute;r&eacute;e de plus en plus comme inutile par les
cadres moyens des gouvernements de la SADCC. Cela pourrait avoir
de graves implications sur l'&eacute;volution future de cet organisme
de coop&eacute;ration fonctionnel unique en son genre.
<P>
Cela confirme, dans un contexte institutionnel compl&egrave;tement
diff&eacute;rent, le point soulev&eacute; par Stronck en ce qui
concerne l'importance de proc&eacute;der &agrave; une nette r&eacute;partition
des comp&eacute;tences au sein de l'administration nationale et
d'&eacute;tablir un m&eacute;canisme d'arbitrage et de gestion
des conflits entre les divers acteurs nationaux charg&eacute;s
de traiter avec l'organisme r&eacute;gional.
<H4>Aper&ccedil;u des insuffisances</H4>

<P>
Dans de nombreux Etats membres de la SADCC, ni le PCN, ni les
PCS ne sont particuli&egrave;rement bien &eacute;quip&eacute;s
pour assumer les responsabilit&eacute;s r&eacute;gionales qui
leur incombent. Cela refl&egrave;te en partie le fait qu'ils conservent
g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement &agrave; la fois les responsabilit&eacute;s
nationales et les responsabilit&eacute;s r&eacute;gionales, bien
que cette situation soit tout &agrave; fait pr&eacute;visible
&eacute;tant donn&eacute; les contraintes de capacit&eacute;s
auxquelles sont confront&eacute;es de nombreuses administrations
nationales en Afrique australe.
<P>
Renforcer les apports nationaux dans les d&eacute;bats politiques
r&eacute;gionaux pourrait se r&eacute;v&eacute;ler crucial dans
les ann&eacute;es &agrave; venir, &eacute;tant donn&eacute; que
la SADCC tente d'effectuer la transition vers une Communaut&eacute;
de d&eacute;veloppement de l'Afrique australe. Si l'on n'am&eacute;liore
pas les capacit&eacute;s nationales &agrave; prendre part de mani&egrave;re
positive aux d&eacute;bats politiques r&eacute;gionaux, on verra
s'accro&icirc;tre les dangers de fragmentation, les frais et les
b&eacute;n&eacute;fices de la construction d'une telle Communaut&eacute;
n'&eacute;tant pas r&eacute;partis de mani&egrave;re &eacute;gale.
Il faudra s'attaquer de face &agrave; ce probl&egrave;me, et non
l'&eacute;luder en mettant l'accent sur le d&eacute;veloppement
de structures r&eacute;gionales centralis&eacute;es, m&ecirc;me
s'il sera peut-&ecirc;tre n&eacute;cessaire de poursuivre le d&eacute;veloppement
des structures r&eacute;gionales au fur et &agrave; mesure qu'elles
seront de plus en plus requises par des structures nationales
fonctionnant mieux.
<P>
Cette constatation ajoute du poids &agrave; la conclusion de Stronck
selon laquelle &quot;Si le syst&egrave;me administratif de gestion
de la politique int&eacute;rieure ne poss&egrave;de pas les qualit&eacute;s
et les performances suffisantes, il est peu vraisemblable qu'il
se r&eacute;v&egrave;le plus apte &agrave; g&eacute;rer la politique
r&eacute;gionale&quot;.
<P>
Il est toutefois important que les partenaires coop&eacute;rants
internationaux de la SADCC ne perdent pas de vue que, comme l'a
soulign&eacute; Stronck, la qualit&eacute; et la r&eacute;ussite
du niveau national &agrave; traiter avec les organismes r&eacute;gionaux
d&eacute;pendent de la &quot;coh&eacute;rence interne de l'appareil
administratif&quot; qui, &agrave; son tour, est subordonn&eacute;e
&agrave; &quot;un niveau &eacute;lev&eacute; de tradition et de
culture administratives&quot;.
<P>
C'est seulement maintenant que ce th&egrave;me est en train de
se d&eacute;velopper en Afrique australe et cela sugg&egrave;re
que les agences de financement ext&eacute;rieures devraient tenter,
dans la mesure du possible, de s'assurer, d'une part, qu'elles
comprennent bien elles-m&ecirc;mes les dispositions et proc&eacute;dures
institutionnelles de la SADCC (voir encadr&eacute;) et que, d'autre
part, leurs structures manag&eacute;riales de coop&eacute;ration
r&eacute;gionale soient en accord avec ces dispositions.
<p>
<TABLE BORDER=2>
     <TR>
          <TD><CENTER><H4><B>Comprendre les dispositions institutionnelles / le cas de
la CE/UE et de la SADC</B></H4>
</CENTER>
<P>
Malgr&eacute; l'engagement sinc&egrave;re de la Communaut&eacute;
europ&eacute;enne (maintenant l'Union europ&eacute;enne) &agrave;
soutenir les efforts de coop&eacute;ration et d'int&eacute;gration
r&eacute;gionales dans la r&eacute;gion de la SADCC, il appara&icirc;t
parfois que ses dispositions administratives pour la mise en oeuvre
de cet engagement aillent &agrave; l'encontre du but recherch&eacute;.
Les phases op&eacute;rationnelles initiales des n&eacute;gociations
communes UE-SADCC pour d&eacute;terminer une enveloppe pour la
coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale, d&eacute;finir ses composants
sectoriels et dresser la liste des projets s&eacute;lectionn&eacute;s
dans chaque composant sectoriel, fonctionnent bien. C'est &agrave;
l'&eacute;tape suivante, lorsque l'UE s&eacute;lectionne dans
la liste les projets &agrave; financer, que des probl&egrave;mes
surgissent et ces probl&egrave;mes se poursuivent tout au long
des phases suivantes d'&eacute;laboration, d'estimation et de
mise en oeuvre des projets.
<P>
Ces difficult&eacute;s sont dues au fait que, une fois s&eacute;lectionn&eacute;
par le secr&eacute;tariat de la SADC comme projet r&eacute;gional,
la responsabilit&eacute; pour les phases d&eacute;taill&eacute;es
de l'ex&eacute;cution, y compris le financement du projet, est
attribu&eacute;e, conform&eacute;ment aux proc&eacute;dures de
la SADC, aux agences du pays dans lequel le projet doit &ecirc;tre
mis en oeuvre. Ceci n'est soit pas compris, soit pas suivi par
les bureaux de l'UE &agrave; Bruxelles ou par les d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s
de l'UE dans chaque pays de la SADC. Par voie de cons&eacute;quence,
on note des retards importants dans l'engagement des fonds et
la mise en oeuvre des projets r&eacute;gionaux.
<P>
De mani&egrave;re plus g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, les d&eacute;l&eacute;gations
de l'UE semblent accorder une faible priorit&eacute; &agrave;
la gestion administrative du soutien de l'UE &agrave; la coop&eacute;ration
r&eacute;gionale avec la SADC, plus particuli&egrave;rement avant
la signature d'une proposition de financement, et aux d&eacute;bats
politiques r&eacute;gionaux qui s'ensuivent dans le secteur pour
lequel leur pays d'affectation est responsable, conform&eacute;ment
aux proc&eacute;dures de la SADC. L'UE et les bailleurs de fonds
en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral devraient apporter leur soutien aux institutions
nationales qui mettent en oeuvre les programmes de la coop&eacute;ration
r&eacute;gionale. Pour que leur aide soit la plus efficace possible,
ils devraient agir dans des cadres r&eacute;gionaux d&eacute;finis
dont l'efficacit&eacute; a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;prouv&eacute;e,
plut&ocirc;t que de suivre leurs propres proc&eacute;dures orient&eacute;es
par les bailleurs de fonds.

<H3>Dimensions culturelles de la gestion des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement:
&eacute;ditorial <BR>
</H3>

<P>
par <I>Stanley Please</I>
<P>
Texte int&eacute;gral d'un article paru dans le <I>Bulletin DPMN,
2(2) ao&ucirc;t 1994: pages 2 - 3 </CENTER></I><HR>

<P>
Dans un article r&eacute;cent, <I>l'Economist </I>affirmait que
&quot;les civilisations en plein essor se plaisent &agrave; expliquer
leur r&eacute;ussite &eacute;conomique non pas par quelque changement
laborieux des avantages comparatifs ou par l'&eacute;volution
technologique, mais bien par le fait qu'elles ont mis en exergue
des vertus uniques &agrave; leur culture. Vu les succ&egrave;s
&eacute;conomiques cons&eacute;cutives des pays de l'Asie orientale
au cours des deux derni&egrave;res d&eacute;cennies, qui sont
susceptibles &agrave; se reproduire pendant la prochaine d&eacute;cennie,
l'article continue par affirmer que &quot;quelques Asiatiques
ont commenc&eacute; &agrave; proclamer la sup&eacute;riorit&eacute;
des valeurs asiatiques sur celles de l'Occident.&quot;
<P>
Mais quelle est vraiment l'importance des valeurs culturelles
dans l'&eacute;valuation de l'efficacit&eacute; de la gestion
des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement?
<P>
Tous ceux qui ont collabor&eacute; &agrave; la r&eacute;daction
du pr&eacute;sent Bulletin estiment que ces valeurs sont effectivement
importantes. L'un d'entre eux, Daniel Etounga-Manguelle, en est
convaincu qu'elles sont au coeur m&ecirc;me de l'&eacute;chec
de l'Afrique &agrave; d&eacute;velopper des institutions, tant
au micro-niveau qu'au macro-niveau, contribuant &agrave; la croissance
&eacute;conomique et &agrave; l'all&eacute;gement de la pauvret&eacute;.
<P>
Cette unanimit&eacute; r&eacute;side en partie dans le concept
et la d&eacute;finition de culture adopt&eacute;s par les collaborateurs.
Cette d&eacute;finition est bien plus qu'une simple r&eacute;f&eacute;rence
&agrave; la cr&eacute;ativit&eacute; artistique, litt&eacute;raire
et architecturale, &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation, etc.
<P>
Qu'est-ce que ce terme devra r&eacute;ellement inclure? Thierry
Verhelst soutient que la d&eacute;finition devrait, en effet,
tout englober, mais il d&eacute;conseille l'adoption d'une attitude
trop extr&ecirc;me. Cet avertissement vient du fait qu'il consid&egrave;re
la culture en termes dynamiques, c'est-&agrave;-dire que les communaut&eacute;s
adaptent leur h&eacute;ritage tant aux influences internes qu'aux
influences externes afin de relever les &quot;d&eacute;fis de
leur environnement naturel et social.&quot; Ce qui signifie que
la culture est d&eacute;termin&eacute;e par le comportement individuel
et social, en m&ecirc;me temps qu'elle le d&eacute;termine. 
<P>
Certains pensent que la faiblesse principale de la politique &eacute;conomique
africaine depuis l'ind&eacute;pendance provient moins de la culture
africaine que du pouvoir politique de ceux qui ont tout &agrave;
gagner de politiques d&eacute;form&eacute;es - les secteurs urbains
non agricoles, l'arm&eacute;e, les employ&eacute;s des entreprises
publiques inefficaces, et ceux qui tirent des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts
des syst&egrave;mes de contr&ocirc;le et d'autorisation. Verhelst
leur r&eacute;pond que les rapports de forces dans la vie politique
sont eux-m&ecirc;mes le produit de la culture de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;.
<P>
Mais alors que l'&eacute;tude de la culture en tant que ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne
dynamique pourrait, dans un certain sens, expliquer pleinement
la r&eacute;ussite ou l'&eacute;chec d'une soci&eacute;t&eacute;
&agrave; d&eacute;velopper des capacit&eacute;s efficaces pour
la gestion des politiques &eacute;conomiques, elle semble, dans
un autre sens, rester tr&egrave;s vague sur bien des points. Cependant,
Verhelst ne donne aucune indication sur la mani&egrave;re dont
les caract&eacute;ristiques culturelles devraient ou pourraient
&ecirc;tre modifi&eacute;es pour renforcer les capacit&eacute;s
de gestion.
<P>
Etounga-Manguelle s'attaque de plein front &agrave; cette lacune.
Il est persuad&eacute; que l'Afrique est 'l'enfant malade' du
monde en voie de d&eacute;veloppement parce qu'elle n'a pas su
reconna&icirc;tre la faiblesse de certaines pratiques et attitudes
inh&eacute;rentes &agrave; son h&eacute;ritage culturel. Il pense
que ce sont ces pratiques et attitudes qui sont &quot;au coeur
m&ecirc;me des faiblesses institutionnelles des organismes africains.&quot;
Elles sont des &quot;normes et valeurs fossilis&eacute;es&quot;
qui emprisonnent l'Afrique dans un dilemme &eacute;conomique.
Tout en acceptant la d&eacute;finition et le concept de culture
formul&eacute;s par Verhelst, il souligne la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;
d'utiliser la culture comme instrument pour am&eacute;liorer les
capacit&eacute;s de gestion &eacute;conomique tant au micro-niveau
qu'au macro-niveau.
<P>
Rejetant les changements dict&eacute;s par l'ext&eacute;rieur,
qu'il juge non-durables, comme par exemple les &quot;programmes
d'ajustement structurel&quot; impos&eacute;s par les institutions
de Bretton Woods, il affirme le besoin d'&eacute;laborer de mani&egrave;re
interne des &quot;programmes d'ajustement culturel.&quot; Une
fois encore, tout comme Verhelst, il soutient que les programmes
doivent s'enraciner au plus profond dans l'histoire culturelle
de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;. Mais il faut &eacute;galement faire
preuve d'une plus grande volont&eacute; de rejeter ou de modifier
les &eacute;l&eacute;ments de l'histoire qui font obstacle au
d&eacute;veloppe- ment africain.
<P>
Etounga-Manguelle n'est pas seulement un homme de paroles, c'est
aussi un homme d'action. Il rend compte des programmes d&eacute;j&agrave;
mis en route par son organisation pan-africaine SADEG pour contribuer
&agrave; 'l'ajustement culturel' exig&eacute; des Africains et
des managers africains pour am&eacute;liorer l'efficacit&eacute;
de leurs organisations. Il pense que l'exp&eacute;rience acquise
d&eacute;montre d&eacute;j&agrave; que l'ajustement culturel est
non seulement n&eacute;cessaire, mais encore parfaitement possible
en Afrique. 
<P>
Julius Jeppe est tout aussi convaincu que le changement de r&eacute;gime
politique aura de tr&egrave;s fortes r&eacute;percussions sur
les institutions et processus de gestion des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement
en Afrique du Sud. Ces derniers en viendront en effet &agrave;
refl&eacute;ter la nouvelle dominance de la culture afrocentrique
avec ses propres caract&eacute;ristiques bien distinctes de la
culture eurocentrique qui avait pr&eacute;domin&eacute; par le
pass&eacute;.
<P>
Il voit d&eacute;j&agrave; des signes pr&eacute;curseurs de ce
changement dans le processus par lequel la politique de reconstruction
et de d&eacute;veloppe- ment de l'ANC a &eacute;t&eacute; formul&eacute;e,
ainsi que dans son contenu, et aussi dans un grand nombre de dispositions
pr&eacute;vues par la nouvelle constitution sud-africaine. Les
deux documents soulignent l'importance du r&ocirc;le des communaut&eacute;s
et des structures traditionnelles du pouvoir et des processus
politiques. Ils mettent l'accent sur l'&eacute;tablissement d'un
consensus et rejettent l'esprit de conflit et de concurrence qui
caract&eacute;rise les cultures occidentales.
<P>
Jeppe ne s'interroge pas sur l'impact de ces changements pour
la qualit&eacute; future de la gestion des politiques de gestion
en Afrique du Sud. Il en est toutefois convaincu qu'ils affecteront
surtout des domaines tels que le syst&egrave;me foncier, le d&eacute;veloppement
d'une classe et culture entreprenantes, ainsi que d'autres &eacute;l&eacute;ments
essentiels pour la d&eacute;termination d'une politique &eacute;conomique,
et par cons&eacute;quent des performances &eacute;conomiques.
<P>
L'expression 'dimensions culturelles de la gestion des politiques
de d&eacute;veloppement' fait penser quasi automatiquement aux
probl&egrave;mes tels qu'ils surviennent dans les pays en voie
de d&eacute;veloppement. Marinette Oomen souligne l'erreur de
cette &eacute;troitesse de vue. L'erreur est particuli&egrave;rement
importante pour les pays qui d&eacute;pendent fortement des flux
d'aide et d'assistance technique externes - de toute &eacute;vidence
les pays africains.
<P>
Pour ces pays, les caract&eacute;ristiques culturelles des pays
donateurs doivent &ecirc;tre incorpor&eacute;es dans le concept.
Dans la pratique, la relation d'aide n'est pas une association
entre partenaires &eacute;gaux. Tant le concept que le style de
relation sont domin&eacute;s par le donateur.
<P>
De mani&egrave;re plus significative toutefois, Oomen attire l'attention
sur le th&egrave;me plus restreint mais non moins important de
la culture qui s'est d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e dans la communaut&eacute;
d'aide - au sein des agences d'aide et des ONG, ainsi que dans
les agences des pays donateurs et b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires.
Son analyse et ses r&eacute;flexions se basent notamment sur l'&eacute;tude
de cas portant sur les projets d'aide n&eacute;erlandais au Mali.
<P>
Son article d&eacute;range, car il sugg&egrave;re l'existence
&quot;d'ordres du jour cach&eacute;s&quot;; l'auteur traduit son
inqui&eacute;tude &agrave; l'&eacute;gard des documents r&eacute;dig&eacute;s
par les N&eacute;erlandais et en n&eacute;erlandais, &agrave;
tous les niveaux du cycle de projet, et des documents cens&eacute;s
d&eacute;finir les objectifs du projet, ses r&eacute;sultats et
les groupes-cibles, mais qui semblent plus destin&eacute;s &agrave;
d&eacute;router qu'&agrave; &eacute;clairer.
<P>
Tout en gardant une attitude positive, elle pense que tout ce
qui se raconte au sujet des projets durables et de 'l'appropriation'
des programmes et projets par les b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires
ne restera que vaines paroles si les faiblesses de la culture
de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement ne sont pas modifi&eacute;es
conform&eacute;ment aux suggestions faites dans son &eacute;tude
de cas.
<P>
A quoi nous am&egrave;ne alors cette discussion provocatrice sur
les dimensions culturelles de la gestion des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement?
Les &eacute;conomistes du d&eacute;veloppement devraient- ils
&ecirc;tre mis &agrave; la retraite et remplac&eacute;s au sein
des gouvernements et des agences d'aide par des &eacute;tudiants
en culture - selon toute vraisemblance des sociologues, des avocats,
des anthropologues, des experts en politicologie et des historiens?
<P>
Certes, les &eacute;conomistes ont tendance &agrave; voir les
gens du monde entier plus comme des personnes semblables que comme
des &ecirc;tres diff&eacute;rents, r&eacute;agissant de mani&egrave;re
similaire, que ce soit en tant qu'individus ou en tant que groupes,
aux occasions du march&eacute; et &agrave; des stimulants en termes
de ce qu'ils produisent et de ce qu'ils ach&egrave;tent. Bien
entendu 'similarit&eacute;' des r&eacute;ponses ne signifie pas
'identit&eacute;' des r&eacute;ponses. Il y a encore de la place
pour que les caract&eacute;ristiques et institutions culturelles
des peuples jouent leur r&ocirc;le. Mais lorsque l'on parle d'&eacute;laboration
de politiques, les &eacute;conomistes pensent - &agrave; tort
ou &agrave; raison - qu'ils se concentrent sur les variables les
plus cruciales et universelles qui d&eacute;terminent le comportement
&eacute;conomique des individus, des groupes et des pays.
<P>
De plus, malgr&eacute; l'importance particuli&egrave;re accord&eacute;e
par les auteurs &agrave; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de dynamiser
les caract&eacute;ristiques culturelles d'un pays afin d'&eacute;viter
la stagnation et m&ecirc;me le d&eacute;clin &eacute;conomique,
les &eacute;conomistes se pr&eacute;occupent g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement
du fait que les changements 'sensibles' de politiques et de programmes
visant &agrave; g&eacute;n&eacute;rer la croissance &eacute;conomique
et r&eacute;duire la pauvret&eacute; puissent &ecirc;tre rejet&eacute;s
pour cause d'incompatibilit&eacute; avec la culture d'un pays.
Comme d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;voqu&eacute;, ce danger est particuli&egrave;rement
inqui&eacute;tant l&agrave; o&ugrave; la d&eacute;finition de
la culture englobe les groupes d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts politiques
puissants qui se sont constitu&eacute;s autour de politiques d&eacute;form&eacute;es.
<P>
Mais ce sont l&agrave; des questions qui ressortent des r&eacute;flexions
sur les articles parus dans le Bulletin relativement &agrave;
la gestion des politiques au niveau macro. Au niveau micro, l'importance
de concevoir des projets et des programmes en accordant un r&ocirc;le
majeur aux facteurs politiques pertinents est ind&eacute;niable.
Il n'est plus possible d'ignorer, &eacute;tant trop longue, la
litanie des projets rat&eacute;s (par exemple le 'Rapport Wapenhans'
sur les projets de la Banque mondiale) qui doivent souvent leur
&eacute;chec &agrave; l'incapacit&eacute; de discerner les caract&eacute;ristiques
culturelles locales.
<P>
Toutefois, m&ecirc;me au niveau micro, des r&eacute;serves peuvent
&ecirc;tre &eacute;mises quant &agrave; un attachement trop important
&agrave; l'opinion selon laquelle le d&eacute;veloppement doit
s'enraciner dans la culture des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s. Le d&eacute;veloppement
&eacute;conomique implique obligatoirement le changement du comportement
des individus et des groupes. 
<P>
Avec tout le respect pour les efforts et l'optimisme d'Etounga-Manguelle,
il faut au moins reconna&icirc;tre que, historiquement, le dynamisme
n&eacute;cessaire au d&eacute;veloppement provient souvent, si
pas toujours, de groupes non endog&egrave;nes, fr&eacute;quemment
mis au ban de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; et qui n'ont pas leurs
'racines' dans le pays, comme par exemple les juifs en Europe,
les quakers et autres non- conformistes en Grande-Bretagne, les
Chinois dans de nombreux pays d'Asie de l'Est, les Libanais et
les Asiatiques dans divers pays d'Afrique. Aux Etats-Unis, personne
n'a de 'racines' dans une soci&eacute;t&eacute; traditionnelle,
&agrave; l'exception de ceux qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; parqu&eacute;s
de force dans des r&eacute;serves et interdits de toute participation
au processus de d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique.
<P>
Verhelst et consorts peuvent bien insister sur le fait &quot;qu'il
ne peut y avoir de d&eacute;veloppement sans racines&quot;, mais
l'argument selon lequel &quot;il ne peut y avoir de d&eacute;veloppement
si les racines sont trop fortes et trop inflexibles&quot; est
tout aussi valable - une proposition que ne d&eacute;sapprouverait,
je pense, aucun des collaborateurs, y compris Verhelst et Etounga-Manguelle.

<H3>De l'ajustement structurel &agrave; l'ajustement culturel:
la seule solution pour l'Afrique</H3>

<P>

<P>
Texte int&eacute;gral d'un article paru dans le <I>Bulletin DPMN,
2(2) ao&ucirc;t 1994: pages 6 - 7 </CENTER></I><HR>

<H4>L'enfant malade du tiers monde</H4>

<P>
Alors que la plupart des pays en voie de d&eacute;veloppement
d'Asie et d'Am&eacute;rique latine ont d&eacute;coll&eacute;,
tant sur le plan de la rapidit&eacute; de leur croissance que
sur celui de l'all&eacute;gement de la pauvret&eacute;, la plupart
des pays d'Afrique sub-saharienne demeurent confront&eacute;s
&agrave; une stagnation et m&ecirc;me &agrave; une croissance
n&eacute;gative de leur revenu par t&ecirc;te et au fl&eacute;au
persistant d'une pauvret&eacute; d&eacute;gradante qui n'a plus
rien d'humain.
<P>
Les Africains et les observateurs ext&eacute;rieurs, s'affrontent
au sujet des causes &eacute;conomiques derri&egrave;re ce triste
&eacute;tat des choses. Beaucoup rejettent la faute sur des facteurs
externes et tout particuli&egrave;rement sur la d&eacute;t&eacute;rioration
des accords commerciaux relatifs aux exportations et importations
d'Afrique, notamment le prix du p&eacute;trole depuis le d&eacute;but
des ann&eacute;es 70. Les probl&egrave;mes externes se sont encore
aggrav&eacute;s par les obligations de service de la dette qui
ont atteint un point critique dans les ann&eacute;es 80 et qui
n'ont pas cess&eacute; depuis lors.
<P>
D'autres insistent plus sur trois facteurs internes. Le premier
facteur est le bouleversement politique qui a frapp&eacute; les
pays africains depuis l'ind&eacute;pendance, suivi de la transition
h&eacute;sitante vers des processus d&eacute;mocratiques - un
bouleversement atteignant son paroxysme dans des pays tels que
le Lib&eacute;ria, la Somalie et le Rwanda. Le deuxi&egrave;me
facteur, ce sont les politiques de d&eacute;veloppe- ment non
appropri&eacute;es qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; adopt&eacute;es depuis
l'ind&eacute;pendance et en particulier, leur impact sur la rentabilit&eacute;
agricole. Le troisi&egrave;me facteur est le taux de croissance
galopant de la population.
<H4>Solutions impos&eacute;es par l'ext&eacute;rieur</H4>

<P>
Au cours des ann&eacute;es 80, malgr&eacute; les difficult&eacute;s
et la maigre rentabilit&eacute; &eacute;conomique, on peut dire
que l'Afrique a continu&eacute; &agrave; vivre dans un &eacute;tat
de gr&acirc;ce aux yeux du reste du monde et en particulier des
gens des pays d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s. Malgr&eacute; le tarissement
du flux de fonds priv&eacute;s externes vers l'Afrique, le flux
d'assistance officielle fut maintenu et m&ecirc;me accru - bien
que les experts continuent &agrave; se disputer sur les flux nets
compar&eacute;s aux flux bruts, sur l'insuffisance des flux d'aide
en comparaison avec la perte de recettes du commerce de mati&egrave;res
premi&egrave;res, et sur d'autres probl&egrave;mes similaires.
<P>
L'Afrique a pay&eacute; cet &eacute;tat de gr&acirc;ce en acceptant
qu'on lui impose des conditions importantes en retour d'une assistance
externe. Les institutions de Bretton Woods prirent la t&ecirc;te
&agrave; cet &eacute;gard; l'ajustement structurel fut mis &agrave;
l'ordre du jour et demeura le fil conducteur principal des politiques
et programmes &eacute;conomiques pendant les ann&eacute;es 90.
<P>
L'ajustement structurel est destin&eacute; &agrave; &eacute;tablir
&agrave; la fois un &eacute;quilibre macro-&eacute;conomique et
les conditions n&eacute;cessaires &agrave; une croissance durable.
Il ne fait aucun doute que certains succ&egrave;s peuvent &ecirc;tre
attribu&eacute;s &agrave; ces politiques. Et c'est justement parce
qu'il reste encore beaucoup &agrave; faire pour assainir les politiques
et les programmes, que l'on peut s'attendre &agrave; de nouvelles
am&eacute;liorations des performances.
<P>
Mais comme l'a montr&eacute; une &eacute;tude r&eacute;cente de
la Banque mondiale, les programmes d'ajustement structurel n'ont
pas &eacute;t&eacute; les 'panac&eacute;es' escompt&eacute;es.
La Banque mondiale insiste sur le fait que, &agrave; moins que
les pays africains 's'approprient' ces programmes, ils n'auront
aucun effet durable et seront vou&eacute;s &agrave; l'&eacute;chec,
sauf &eacute;ventuellement &agrave; court terme. Les solutions
impos&eacute;es aux probl&egrave;mes africains par l'ext&eacute;rieur
ne constituent nullement des solutions en termes de croissance
&eacute;conomique durable et d'all&eacute;gement de la pauvret&eacute;.
<P>
Mais l'Afrique est-elle capable de trouver ses propres solutions?
Ce dont nous ne pouvons douter, c'est de sa volont&eacute; de
changer les choses. Les Africains ont eux-m&ecirc;mes commenc&eacute;
&agrave; examiner leur &eacute;tat de sant&eacute; g&eacute;n&eacute;ral
en examinant leur culture. 
<H4>Ajustement culturel</H4>

<P>
Thierry Verhelst a raison de nous rappeler que le changement social
ne peut &ecirc;tre impos&eacute; de l'ext&eacute;rieur, mais doit
au contraire constituer une transformation culturelle endog&egrave;ne.
Il a en outre raison de parler de la culture comme d'un outil.
Afin de pouvoir relever les d&eacute;fis de notre environnement
naturel et social, nous devons en permanence adapter notre arsenal
de ressources techniques, socio-&eacute;conomiques et mystiques.
C'est cette adaptation m&ecirc;me que j'appelle 'ajustement culturel'.
C'est la condition sine qua non de tout progr&egrave;s.
<P>
L'influence de la culture sur la politique, l'&eacute;conomie
et la vie sociale est loin d'&ecirc;tre n&eacute;gligeable. La
crise actuelle qui a frapp&eacute; de plein fouet nos pays est
&agrave; la fois une crise morale, politique et &eacute;conomique.
Elle nous oblige &agrave; ouvrir les yeux sur certaines pratiques
et attitudes qui nous emp&ecirc;chent sans aucun doute de marcher
vers la modernit&eacute;.
<P>
Ces pratiques et attitudes sont au coeur m&ecirc;me des faiblesses
institutionnelles de l'Afrique. Elles sont &eacute;galement le
point central de l'examen de la gestion des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement,
qui est le th&egrave;me principal du pr&eacute;sent Bulletin.
<H4>Le legs culturel de l'Afrique</H4>

<P>
Un exemple en est la recherche fr&eacute;n&eacute;tique de consensus
par les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s africaines, consid&eacute;r&eacute;
comme le seul garant de la paix sociale. Mais il nous a aussi
amen&eacute; &agrave; choisir des formes moins d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es
et non syst&eacute;matiques de gestion sociale, &eacute;conomique
et politique.
<P>
Ces derni&egrave;res ont tendance &agrave; reposer sur une tradition
orale qui ne facilite pas la codification des processus. Il n'est
donc pas surprenant que l'on puisse attribuer en grande partie
les faiblesses institutionnelles des organismes et leur manque
d'efficacit&eacute; dans leur prise de responsabilit&eacute;,
&agrave; des &eacute;l&eacute;ments culturels qui caract&eacute;risent
nos relations les uns avec les autres.
<P>
Le r&ocirc;le de 'l'individu' met encore plus ces relations &agrave;
rude &eacute;preuve. La place assign&eacute;e &agrave; l'individu
et le refus g&eacute;n&eacute;ral d'accepter sa capacit&eacute;
&agrave; prendre sa propre destin&eacute;e en main en dehors de
la communaut&eacute; &agrave; laquelle il appartient, signifient
qu'il oscille constamment entre le besoin de s'int&eacute;grer
dans un clan ou une tribu &agrave; qui il doit tout et le souci
d'affirmation personnelle qui est la manifestation in&eacute;vitable
de son 'ego'. 
<P>
Ce n'est donc pas un paradoxe de constater que dans les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s
africaines, les individus restent des personnalit&eacute;s d&eacute;chir&eacute;es,
manquant de confiance en elles-m&ecirc;mes et qui nourrissent
un besoin excessif d'estime, ce qui s'av&egrave;re avoir peu de
rapport avec leur contribution individuelle &agrave; l'&eacute;conomie
et &agrave; la soci&eacute;t&eacute;.
<H4>Un dilemme: permanence ou rupture?</H4>

<P>
L'Afrique est domin&eacute;e par un monde rural dont le mode de
vie - sa culture - n'a pratiquement pas chang&eacute; depuis des
milliers d'ann&eacute;es. Cette civilisation, avec ses normes
et valeurs fixes et fossilis&eacute;es, est en train d'emprisonner
les Africains dans un dilemme &eacute;conomique dont les options
sont caract&eacute;ris&eacute;es &agrave; la fois par la permanence et la rupture.
<P>
D'un c&ocirc;t&eacute;, il y a la permanence d'une vue du monde
o&ugrave; la vie est en symbiose avec la nature. Cette vue impose
de n'extraire de la nature que ce qui est strictement n&eacute;cessaire
&agrave; la survie. Personne ne devrait produire pour produire.
De plus, la valeur des &ecirc;tres humains se mesure &agrave;
son '&ecirc;tre' et non &agrave; son 'avoir'.
<P>
Par cons&eacute;quent, les incitants et les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices
mat&eacute;riels ne peuvent &ecirc;tre invoqu&eacute;s comme force
motrice de la gestion des institutions ou de l'&eacute;conomie.
<P>
D'un autre c&ocirc;t&eacute;, il existe une rupture provoqu&eacute;e
par l'introduction au coeur m&ecirc;me de nos villages d'une civilisation
mat&eacute;rialiste venant de l'Ouest. Aucun Africain ne peut
rester indiff&eacute;rent aux b&eacute;n&eacute;fices que l'on
peut tirer de ces forces &eacute;trang&egrave;res sur le plan
de la technologie, des soins m&eacute;dicaux et de la qualit&eacute;
de vie. Certes, aucun Africain ne peut nier l'attirance qu'exercent
ces changements sur leur jeunesse avide de progr&egrave;s et soucieuse
d'&ecirc;tre &agrave; la page.
<P>
C'est l&agrave; le dilemme qui laisse l'Afrique ballott&eacute;e
entre deux r&eacute;cifs. Il n'est pas &eacute;tonnant de voir
le continent b&eacute;gayer, h&eacute;siter et se chercher. Doit-elle
monter dans le train bond&eacute; de la modernit&eacute; fon&ccedil;ant
vers une destination inconnue, doit-elle regarder le train passer
et se contenter de ramasser les quelques produits qui en tombent
ou doit-elle rester attach&eacute;e &agrave; son wagon traditionnel?
<H4>Le d&eacute;fi</H4>

<P>
Mon opinion est que l'Afrique doit accepter la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;
d'un ajustement culturel et accrocher le wagon africain au train
du monde. C'est le pr&eacute;alable pour voir &eacute;merger une
Afrique &agrave; m&ecirc;me d'affronter le monde avec respect.
<P>
Elle ne pourra le faire qu'en d&eacute;montrant que nous aussi
sommes capables d'atteindre des niveaux d'efficacit&eacute; institutionnelle,
des taux de croissance &eacute;conomique et d'all&eacute;gement
de la pauvret&eacute;, comme d'autres l'ont fait ailleurs. Je
pense aussi que les Africains sont pr&ecirc;ts &agrave; transformer
le train omnibus en express et m&ecirc;me en TGV haut de gamme.
C'est pour contribuer &agrave; ce processus que la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
africaine d'&eacute;tude, d'exploitation et de gestion a mis au
point un module de formation (intitul&eacute; &quot;L'Entreprise
africaine&quot;), destin&eacute; &agrave; am&eacute;liorer les
performances des managers d'entreprises travaillant dans un environnement
africain. Proc&eacute;dant selon la m&eacute;thode de l'&eacute;tude
de cas, les participants:
<UL>
<LI>s'interrogent sur leurs propres pratiques individuelles et
collectives ou leurs attitudes sociales &agrave; la lumi&egrave;re
des objectifs de l'entreprise et sur base d'un audit culturel
appropri&eacute;.
<LI>&eacute;laborent un plan d'action visant &agrave; r&eacute;duire
l'impact des pratiques et attitudes qui limitent le rendement
de l'entreprise.
</UL>

<P>
Bien que les s&eacute;minaires aient &eacute;t&eacute; limit&eacute;s
aux entreprises priv&eacute;es et semi-publiques en C&ocirc;te
d'Ivoire et au Cameroun, cette d&eacute;marche a d&eacute;j&agrave;
r&eacute;colt&eacute; des succ&egrave;s consid&eacute;rables.
<P>
Mais de mani&egrave;re plus importante et plus large, je pense
qu'elle d&eacute;montre la fa&ccedil;on dont les Africains peuvent
et doivent prendre la responsabilit&eacute; de la gestion des
politiques &eacute;conomiques de leur pays tant au micro- niveau,
qu'au macro-niveau. R&eacute;clamer aux institutions de Bretton
Woods et aux agences qu'elles rendent ses obligations et droits
souverains &agrave; l'Afrique, commence par la reconnaissance
de l'h&eacute;ritage culturel de l'Afrique, de ses points forts
et de ses points faibles. Mais il ne faut pas non plus reculer
&agrave; l'id&eacute;e d'adapter et m&ecirc;me de rejeter certains
&eacute;l&eacute;ments de cet h&eacute;ritage.
<P>
Si nous acceptons ce d&eacute;fi, alors je suis certain que l'histoire
du progr&egrave;s de l'&eacute;conomie africaine au cours du prochain
si&egrave;cle sera totalement diff&eacute;rente de notre triste
histoire depuis l'ind&eacute;pendance.<HR>

Partenariat et coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement: Editorial</h3>
par <i>Stanley Please</i>
<p>
Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans le <i>Bulletin DPMN, 2(3) d&#233;cembre 1994:
pages 2 - 3</i>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
Il est g&#233;n&#233;ralement accept&#233; que l'aide financi&#232;re et technique fournie
par le donateur ne r&#233;ussit &#224; promouvoir le d&#233;veloppement
&#233;conomique et social que si les pays b&#233;n&#233;fi- ciaires 's'approprient' les
projets, les programmes et les politiques soutenus par le donateur. N&#233;anmoins, dans les
pays sub-sahariens, l'action combin&#233;e de flux massifs d'aide et, dans certains cas, d'une
situation &#233;conomique d&#233;sastreuse a conduit &#224; une demande tout aussi
g&#233;n&#233;rale &#224; l'int&#233;rieur des pays donateurs pour que des comptes soient
rendus aux respon- sables politiques et aux &#233;lecteurs sur l'aide fournie. Cette demande
s'exprime m&ecirc;me s'il est reconnu que cela entra&icirc;nerait presque
in&#233;vitablement une plus grande ing&#233;rence du donateur dans les pays
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires et, donc, un sentiment affaibli 'd'appropriation.'
<p>
Ce dilemme et le danger que l'efficacit&#233; de l'aide ne soit entra&icirc;n&#233;e
dans un mouvement n&#233;faste de spirale vers le bas, ont incit&#233; l'ECDPM
&#224; consacrer sa Table ronde de 1994 &#224; 'Partenariat et coop&#233;ration
au d&#233;veloppement: associer la responsabilit&#233; des b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires
au besoin des donateurs de justifier l'utilisation de l'aide.' Un rapport contient le discours
d'introduction de Louk Box, directeur de l'ECDPM, ainsi que les discours de Simba
Makoni, ancien secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral de la Communaut&#233; de
d&#233;veloppement pour l'Afrique australe et de Jan Cedergren, directeur adjoint de
l'Agence su&#233;doise de d&#233;veloppement international (SIDA).
<p>
Ce num&#233;ro du Bulletin reproduit des articles qui ont &#233;t&#233;
pr&#233;sent&#233;s par quelques autres participants de la Table ronde. Ils ont
&#233;t&#233; choisis de mani&#232;re &#224; fournir une diversit&#233; de
points de vue sur la question du partenariat dans la coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement. Les articles choisis se rapportent sp&#233;cifiquement au
d&#233;fi que Louk Box a pr&#233;sent&#233; dans son discours, &#224; savoir "se
concentrer sur la mani&#232;re pratique d'am&#233;liorer le partenariat en tenant
compte des contraintes r&#233;elles de la vie;" et "fournir une indication pratique sur
la mani&#232;re de l'am&#233;liorer." Il exposa &#233;galement trois conditions
n&#233;cessaires pour r&#233;pondre &#224; ce d&#233;fi: premi&#232;rement,
un sujet ne devrait faire l'objet "d' aucun tabou;" deuxi&#232;mement, les participants
devraient se "garder de toute attitude d&#233;fensive;" et troisi&#232;mement, les
participants devraient se concentrer sur "des approches de gestion, pratiques et faisables."
<p>
Dans son article, Fonseca a su faire sien l'esprit de la Table ronde. Il attribue en effet
l'&#233;chec du partenariat &#224; la faiblesse des pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires
combin&#233;e &#224; l'arrogance des donateurs. Toutefois, il souligne que les
faiblesses qu'il a &#224; l'esprit ne sont pas simplement les faiblesses &#233;conomiques
et technologiques, ni m&ecirc;me leurs faiblesses institutionnelles bien que celles-ci soient
importantes. Les faiblesses morales des dirigeants des pays africains le pr&#233;occupent
davantage; de m&ecirc;me que l'arrogance des donateurs qui "sont persuad&#233;s
qu'eux seuls d&#233;tiennent les bonnes id&#233;es." Une plus grande modestie et
davantage de bonne volont&#233; de la part des donateurs pour partager la
responsabilit&#233; des erreurs commises est essentielle, d'apr&#232;s lui, pour
am&#233;liorer la relation de partenariat.
<p>
Cette analyse franche du probl&#232;me que propose Fonseca donne le ton de
l'ensemble de la discussion de la Table ronde. Son article est suivi d'une s&#233;lection
de citations extraites des d&#233;bats, qui en rendent l'esprit.
<p>
Le commentaire m&#233;thodologique de Pinto consiste en un guide utile pour aller au-
del&#224; de la simple r&#233;p&#233;tition de mots &#224; la mode, tels
qu'engagement ou appropriation, et arriver &#224; quelque chose de pratique. Il
souligne que 'l'engagement' est simplement associ&#233; &#224; "l'intention des
dirigeants" tandis que 'l'appropriation' se rapporte aux "acteurs qui d&#233;termineront
la mise en oeuvre." Il conclut en disant: "vous pouvez vous engager sans pour cela
&ecirc;tre un propri&#233;taire responsable, mais vous ne pouvez pas &ecirc;tre un
propri&#233;taire responsable sans vous engager." Il pr&#233;sente une description de
l'Evaluation institutionnelle de l'environnement (IEA), une proc&#233;dure qui permet
d'&#233;valuer et d'am&#233;liorer l'appropriation. Son succ&#232;s d&#233;pend
de la bonne volont&#233; des gouvernements &#224; prendre en charge les co&ucirc;ts
suppl&#233;mentaires qu'elle comporte, et de celle des donateurs &#224; rectifier leurs
propres proc&#233;dures internes.
<p>
La diff&#233;rence de r&ocirc;les au sein du processus politique entre les dirigeants
politiques et les technocrates est &#233;galement soulign&#233;e par Brinkerhoff. Il est
inquiet de voir que les technocrates traitent l'&#233;laboration de politiques comme un
"processus lin&#233;aire" et mettent l'accent sur le principe selon lequel "les
premi&#232;res ordonnances sont les meilleures" au lieu de reconna&icirc;tre qu'il s'agit
d'un "processus politique et interactif" dans lequel "le consensus se construit autour de
solutions qui sont des deuxi&#232;mes ou des troisi&#232;mes choix." A partir de cette
analyse, il d&#233;crit les grandes lignes d'une proc&#233;dure appel&#233;e Mise
en oeuvre d'un changement politique (IPC) que l'USAID a d&#233;velopp&#233;e.
Comme pour la proc&#233;dure de l'IEA de Pinto, l'IPC est con&#231;u pour assurer
&#224; la fois un engagement national et une appropriation des politiques et des pro-
grammes, ainsi que pour d&#233;velopper une relation de partenariat avec les donateurs.
Il illustre l'utilisation de l'IPC en se r&#233;f&#233;rant &#224; l'application qui en
a &#233;t&#233; faite en Zambie.<p>
Dans son discours, Louk Box avait affirm&#233; que les probl&#232;mes
abord&#233;s &#224; la Table ronde s'adressaient tout autant aux ONG qu'aux
bailleurs de fonds. Goyder d'Actionaid l'admet &#233;galement dans son article. Dans
celui-ci, il souligne que, tandis que le partenariat continue &#224; &ecirc;tre la
philosophie ma&icirc;tresse des ONG, "la plupart des ONG sont confront&#233;es
&#224; de r&#233;elles difficult&#233;s pour rendre ce concept tout &#224; fait
op&#233;rationnel." Les pressions nationales qui s'exercent pour rendre plus de comptes
et pour introduire de nouveaux sujets de pr&#233;occupa- tion, tels que
l'environnement, la condition des femmes, etc., "font qu'il est difficile de rendre des
comptes aux communaut&#233;s avec lesquelles nous travaillons." Goyder
pr&#233;sente alors l'exp&#233;rience d'Actionaid face &#224; ce probl&#232;me:
ne pas se pr&#233;cipiter dans le financement de projets mais plut&ocirc;t laisser ces
projets na&icirc;tre de l'action des communaut&#233;s; engager un personnel local qui
vivra et travaillera l&#224; o&ugrave; se d&#233;veloppera le projet; travailler en
collaboration avec le gouvernement local et les communaut&#233;s plut&ocirc;t qu'avec
les gouvernements nationaux; ne pas surcharger le personnel sur le terrain avec des
exigences trop lourdes quant &#224; l'obligation de rendre des rapports. Il tire de cette
exp&#233;rience des le&#231;ons pour les agences d'aide.<p>
Certains participants &#233;taient nettement moins optimistes quant aux chances de
r&#233;forme de la relation d'aide dans le sens d'un partenariat am&#233;lior&#233;.
Pour eux, il faut &ecirc;tre moins id&#233;aliste et plus pragmatique; reconna&icirc;tre
que les "forces en faveur de l'inertie &#224; l'int&#233;rieur de syst&#232;mes
bureaucratiques en place depuis longtemps" sont fortes et envahissantes. Cette citation
vient de l'article de Tabor qui tirait des le&#231;ons de l'engagement de donateurs dans
la recherche agricole. Malgr&#233; les "besoins largement inchang&#233;s de nouvelles
technologies pour r&#233;pondre au probl&#232;me de la pauvret&#233; rurale et
des demandes du pays en nourriture," l'engagement du donateur manque d'envergure,
privil&#233;gie des &#233;quipements difficiles &#224; maintenir, et est soumis
&#224; des changements politiques inutiles de la part du donateur. Tabor d&#233;fend
une approche moins ambitieuse pour les ann&#233;es 90. Il s'agirait d'une approche
o&ugrave; les arrangements de partenariat seraient n&#233;goci&#233;s lorsque l'on
"peut concilier les besoins du b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire et les instruments d'aide du
donateur." Toute autre relation de partenariat &#224; plus long terme "serait plus le
produit d'un heureux hasard que celui d'une politique d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;e."
<p>
Il ressort clairement de ces articles que les participants ont &#224; la fois reconnu
l'importance du dilemme appropriation et obligation de rendre des comptes pos&#233;
par la Table ronde et qu'ils ont pris au s&#233;rieux la demande de Louk Box de se
concentrer sur les conclusions prati- ques que leurs exp&#233;riences ont mises &#224;
jour. Bien s&ucirc;r les discussions revenaient sans cesse sur la difficult&#233; de
cr&#233;er quelque chose se rap- prochant d'une relation entre partenaires &#233;g-
aux, lorsque le pouvoir &#233;conomique, technolo- gique, professionnel, institutionnel
et politique des donneurs et des b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires est si in&#233;gal. 
La SIDA est clairement l'un des quelques donateurs d&#233;sireux et politiquement
capables de reconna&icirc;tre de fa&#231;on explicite cette in&#233;galit&#233; et
de l'affronter. A travers sa politique de 'Renouvellement des r&ocirc;les,' la SIDA essaye
d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;ment de fa&#231;onner sa relation strat&#233;gique et
op&#233;rationnelle avec les b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires de son assistance d'une
mani&#232;re qui permette de pr&#233;venir, ou au moins de diminuer, les effets
nocifs de cette in&#233;galit&#233; sur l'appropriation des projets et des programmes
chez les b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires. Elle reconna&icirc;t que c'est risqu&#233;, mais la
SIDA affirme qu'&#224; moins d'une appropriation r&#233;elle du
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire, les risques d'&#233;checs sont encore plus importants. 
<p>
Si cette strat&#233;gie donne tout son sens &#224; des relations de partenariat entre
des pays o&ugrave; tant le donneur que le b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire placent la politique
de d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique et social en t&ecirc;te de leurs
priorit&#233;s politiques, peut-on dire toutefois que cette strat&#233;gie est aussi
efficace pour tous les autres pays, donateurs et b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires, o&ugrave;
cette situation - malheureusement - ne se retrouve pas? La Table ronde ne se concentrait
pas sur cette diff&#233;rence entre pays.
<p>
Mais le plus pr&#233;occupant, c'est que du c&ocirc;t&#233; des donateurs, les
proc&#233;dures ne varient pas selon qu'il s'agit de pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires
&#224; 'bonne' performance ou &#224; 'mauvaise' performance. Si ce concept de
partenariat devait se d&#233;velopper, il faudrait de la part des donateurs une
volont&#233; plus forte de s'orienter vers la strat&#233;gie pr&ocirc;n&#233;e par
la SIDA dans leurs relations avec ces pays qui luttent s&#233;rieusement contre des
probl&#232;mes &#233;conomiques et sociaux graves. Ces pays devraient instaurer un
climat de confiance tel que leur gouvernement puisse r&#233;ellement s'approprier ces
politiques.<p>
Il est ind&#233;niable que certaines conditions tr&#232;s strictes sont tout &#224; fait
ind&#233;sirables et contre-productives; &#224; titre d'exemple, celles qui sont
attach&#233;es aux pr&ecirc;ts d'ajustement structurel de la Banque mondiale et dont
les implications sur la politique &#233;conomique int&#233;rieure seraient
dict&#233;es par Washington.
<p>
Cependant une telle fermet&#233; pourrait &ecirc;tre souhaitable pour d'autres pays
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires, au moins pour une p&#233;riode limit&#233;e. Cela serait
particuli&#232;rement le cas l&#224; o&ugrave;, apr&#232;s une p&#233;riode de
d&#233;sastre &#233;conomique ou politique, la confiance devrait rena&icirc;tre entre
les donneurs et les b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires. Une fois cette confiance r&#233;tablie,
il serait possible et souhaitable d'acc&#233;l&#233;rer le mouvement vers un
partenariat.
<p>
Une derni&#232;re r&#233;flexion sur cette Table ronde nous fait revenir au discours
de Makoni: "Un partenariat vrai et sinc&#232;re," concluait Makoni, "ne sera pas le
r&#233;sultat, ni en tout ni en partie, de bonnes institutions et de bonnes
proc&#233;dures, mais il na&icirc;tra plut&ocirc;t d'une communaut&#233; claire
d'int&#233;r&ecirc;t, d'une volont&#233; et d'un engagement politiques forts, de
l'honn&ecirc;tet&#233; et de la sinc&#233;rit&#233;." De leur c&ocirc;t&#233;, les
donateurs ne peuvent pas simplement "bl&#226;mer l'incomp&#233;tence ou la
corruption des gouvernements des pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires" et ces
gouvernements, quant &#224; eux, "doivent prendre leur destin en mains afin de
d&#233;terminer l'aide dont ils ont besoin et afin de pouvoir dire 'non' &#224; l'aide
dont ils n'ont pas besoin."
<p>
Le pr&#233;sident de la Table ronde, Louk Box, demanda qu'aucun tabou, qu'aucune
attitude d&#233;fensive ne vienne limiter les d&#233;bats. Le discours que Makoni
pr&#233;senta au participants r&#233;pondait sans nul doute &#224; ce voeu.

R&#233;forme de la fonction publique: Editorial</h3>
par <i>Stanley Please</i>
<p>
Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans le <i>Bulletin DPMN</i>, 3(1) ao&#251;t 1995: pages 2 - 3
</center>
<hr>
<p>
"Dans de nombreux pays de l'Afrique sub-saharienne, l'inefficacit&#233; du service public
risque de miner presque tous les efforts de d&#233;veloppement, ainsi que l'administration
publique de base." Cette citation de Mamadou Dia refl&#232;te la pr&#233;occupation qui
est &#224; la base de toutes les articles de cette &#233;dition du Bulletin.
<p>
Mais cette pr&#233;occupation ne se limite pas &#224; l'Afrique. C'est ce que souligne Kaul dans son
&#233;tude sur les exp&#233;riences men&#233;es r&#233;cemment sur le plan de la r&#233;forme du
service public dans les pays du Commonwealth, dont le Royaume-Uni, l'Australie, la Nouvelle-
Z&#233;lande, l'Inde, le Bangladesh, la Malaisie, Hongkong, Singapour, la Trinit&#233; et Tobago, le
Ghana et la Zambie. Diff&#233;rentes causes politiques et &#233;conomiques aux micro et macro-
niveaux ont &#233;t&#233; &#224; l'origine de ces r&#233;formes. Des changements d'opinions
essentiels se sont op&#233;r&#233;s en ce qui concerne une plus grande efficacit&#233; du r&ocirc;le
de l'Etat dans l'&#233;conomie. Au micro-niveau, on s'est interrog&#233; sur la mani&#232;re la plus
efficace de fournir aux services publics les possibilit&#233;s d'une commercialisation plus
d&#233;velopp&#233;e des d&#233;partements gouvernementaux et de travailler avec le secteur
priv&#233; et les ONG.
<p>
Cependant, ce sont les pays africains qui int&#233;ressent particuli&#232;rement les auteurs. En effet,
c'est en Afrique qu'un ensemble complexe de facteurs a conduit &#224; une situation telle que
pratiquement tous les pays ont des services publiques jug&#233;s d'un oeil critique pour,
premi&#232;rement &ecirc;tre trop importants en termes d'effectifs, deuxi&#232;mement pour
&ecirc;tre excessivement co&ucirc;teux en termes de d&#233;penses budg&#233;taires et
troisi&#232;mement pour &ecirc;tre inefficaces en termes de fourniture des services publics
demand&#233;s par les pays. Dans les ann&#233;es 80, et principalement sous l'influence
ext&#233;rieure du FMI et de la Banque mondiale, l'int&#233;r&ecirc;t se portait essentiellement sur
les deux premiers probl&#232;mes. L'objectif principal &#233;tait alors de ma&icirc;triser les co&ucirc;ts
m&ecirc;me si, comme le souligne Yahaya, le probl&#232;me de l'efficacit&#233; recevait tout de
m&ecirc;me une certaine attention.
<p>
Il est int&#233;ressant de noter que, contrairement aux ann&#233;es 80, tous les auteurs de ce Bulletin
passent quasi sous silence les probl&#232;mes d'embauches excessives dans le service public et de
co&ucirc;ts budg&#233;taires trop &#233;lev&#233;s. Ceci n'est certainement pas d&ucirc; au fait que
les actions entreprises dans les ann&#233;es 80 ont permet de r&#233;soudre efficacement ces
probl&#232;mes. Alors qu'une r&#233;duction en effet consid&#233;rable d'employ&#233;s s'est
op&#233;r&#233;e dans certains pays (par exemple, au Ghana, en R&#233;publique Centrafricaine, en
Guin&#233;e, en Mauritanie et en Ouganda), dans d'autres, le personnel a en r&#233;alit&#233;
augment&#233; (par exemple, en C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, au Malawi, au Niger et en Tanzanie). Par ailleurs,
aucune des r&#233;ductions significatives escompt&#233;es en mati&#232;re de co&ucirc;t
budg&#233;taire du service public n'a et&#233; constat&#233;e, m&ecirc;me l&#224; o&ugrave; les
effectifs ont &#233;t&#233; r&#233;duits. 
<p>
Ces articles semblent refl&#233;ter le transfert d'int&#233;r&ecirc;t consid&#233;rable qui s'est
op&#233;r&#233; dans le d&#233;bat sur la r&#233;forme du service public dans les ann&#233;es 90 en
faveur du troisi&#232;me probl&#232;me, &#224; savoir celui de l'efficacit&#233;. Ceci ne rel&#232;ve
pas seulement du fait que la concentration exclusive sur les effectifs et le co&ucirc;t est aujourd'hui
consid&#233;r&#233;e comme ayant &#233;t&#233; trop restrictive. Ce qui est important, c'est que la
disponibilit&#233; d'un service public efficace offrant des prestations quantitatives et qualitatives est
d&#233;sormais consid&#233;r&#233;e comme une condition n&#233;cessaire pour g&#233;n&#233;rer
un d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique et humain &#224; une cadence plus rapide. Comme le
souligne Corkery, "En dehors de l'importance de l'Etat dans la fourniture des services relatifs &#224;
la loi, l'ordre, la justice, la d&#233;fense, l'infrastructure, l'&#233;ducation et la sant&#233;", on admet
plus g&#233;n&#233;ralement et avec plus de fermet&#233; que dans les ann&#233;es 80 que "les
institutions du march&#233; libre ne peuvent fonctionner que si les institutions gouvernementales
fonctionnement elles aussi."
<p>
C'est dans ce contexte que Corkery et Fofana passent en revue les exp&#233;riences issues des
programmes de r&#233;forme du service public dans les pays anglophones et francophones. On
notera avec int&#233;r&ecirc;t que leurs conclusions sont &#224; peu pr&#232;s identiques quant aux
conditions prioritaires pour le succ&#232;s de la mise en pratique de ces programmes. Trois de ces
conclusions se dessinent: (i) garantir l'implication du gouvernement non seulement en paroles, mais
aussi en pratique par l'instauration de rouages institutionnels techniquement et politiquement
puissants permettant d'entreprendre des r&#233;formes; (ii) garantir l'implication des fonctionnaires
&#224; travers un m&#233;canisme r&#233;gulier gouvernement-syndicat et aussi par d'autres canaux;
(iii) garantir la participation de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile.
<p>
L'article de Rasheed, "Ethique et responsabilit&#233; dans le service public africain," souligne
&#233;galement l'importance de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile dans la r&#233;forme du service public. Son
article pr&#233;sente un rapport sens&#233; mais mordant sur l'importance cruciale de la
soci&#233;t&#233; civile dans la chasse &#224; "la corruption absolue, au patronage, au n&#233;potisme,
... au travail au noir, &#224; l'absent&#233;isme, &#224; l'abus des biens publics" qui sont devenus des
"pratiques tellement r&#233;pandues, devenant m&ecirc;me des normes institutionnelles de
comportement en Afrique, que l'on peut parler &#224; juste titre d'une crise de moralit&#233; dans
les services publics africains." Son analyse des causes profondes de cette crise le conduit &#224; des
conclusions qui se focalisent sur les probl&#232;mes de l'embauche, de la formation, notamment la
formation sur les valeurs professionnelles et sur le service public, et de l'&#233;tablissement et la mise
en place effective de codes de conduite. En outre, ses conclusions, comme celles de Fofana,
soulignent le besoin de "campagnes d'&#233;ducation des masses," "d'instauration de coalitions
d'associations professionnelles et autres organisations pour d&#233;voiler et combattre la corruption"
et, de mani&#232;re plus g&#233;n&#233;rale, pour mobiliser la soci&#233;t&#233; civile et pour
"encourager la participation du peuple afin de garantir la r&#233;activit&#233;, la responsabilit&#233;
et la transparence de la gouvernance." 
<p>
Rasheed reproche aussi aux pays d&#233;velopp&#233;s le r&ocirc;le actif et initiateur que jouent leurs
hommes d'affaires dans la corruption des hauts fonctionnaires en Afrique. En outre, il n'&#233;pargne
pas de ses critiques leurs gouvernements, dont il constate que beaucoup d'entre eux ferment les yeux
et m&ecirc;me donnent leur b&#233;n&#233;diction &#224; des pratiques de corruption dans
l'int&#233;r&ecirc;t des objectifs d'exportation (les pots- de-vin &#233;tant m&ecirc;me
d&#233;ductibles des imp&ocirc;ts pour certains). Il voit en Transparency International un bon
d&#233;but pour "tirer la sonnette d'alarme" sur l'ensemble de ces probl&#232;mes. Cependant, il
soutient tr&#232;s justement la mise en place de conventions internationales visant &#224; garantir
une meilleure transparence dans les transactions et &#224; punir ceux qui sont impliqu&#233;s dans
les pratiques de corruption. <p>
Yahaya se concentre enti&#232;rement sur le probl&#232;me de la formation, identifi&#233;e par les
autres auteurs comme un &#233;l&#233;ment important de la r&#233;forme du service public. Il fait
la distinction entre, d'une part, les pr&#233;c&#233;dentes tentatives de r&#233;forme en Afrique - qui
se focalisaient uniquement sur la formation de fonctionnaires en vue de fournir une "bureaucratie
rationnelle" weberienne - et, d'autre part, la nouvelle conception de r&#233;forme qui se concentre
sur le renforcement des capacit&#233;s de bonne gouvernance. Ce concept n'englobe pas seulement
le service public lui-m&ecirc;me, mais aussi sa relation avec le secteur priv&#233; et avec la
soci&#233;t&#233; civile en g&#233;n&#233;ral. Yahaya pr&#233;sente ensuite bri&#232;vement les
s&#233;minaires, les programmes de formation, et les autres activit&#233;s qui seront organis&#233;s
par les centres de formation &#224; l'analyse et &#224; la gestion des politiques et mis en place
conjointement par le secr&#233;tariat du Commonwealth, l'CEA et l'AAPAM dans six pays francophones,
anglophones et lusophones.
<p>
Ces articles font clairement appara&icirc;tre que les gouvernements africains sont maintenant tout
&#224; fait conscients de la n&#233;cessit&#233; de cr&#233;er des services publics plus efficaces et
profond&#233;ment motiv&#233;s sur lesquels ils peuvent compter pour formuler et appliquer des
politiques et des programmes et, de mani&#232;re plus g&#233;n&#233;rale, pour administrer
efficacement leurs pays. De plus, ces articles d&#233;montrent aussi que des programmes de
r&#233;forme refl&#233;tant cette prise de conscience ont d&#233;j&#224; &#233;t&#233;
amorc&#233;s. 
La question est de savoir si ce sont les gouvernements eux-m&ecirc;mes qui signalent l'&#233;tat
d'urgence de cette situation, ou si ce sont les auteurs de ce Bulletin qui expriment en effet cette
urgence avec suffisamment de conviction. Il est &#233;vident qu'un juste &#233;quilibre doit &ecirc;tre
atteint &#224; cet &#233;gard. Comme le souligne notamment Corkery, les mesures de r&#233;forme
introduites avec trop de pr&#233;cipitation peuvent facilement &#233;chouer car elles courent le
danger d'&ecirc;tre &#224; la fois pr&#233;par&#233;es de mani&#232;re inad&#233;quate avec les
fonctionnaires et la soci&#233;t&#233; civile. Constituer des groupements puissants charg&#233;s des
r&#233;formes au sein des pays est un message porteur dont on ne peut nier l'importance. Il est
certain que les mesures de r&#233;forme impos&#233;es par les institutions de Bretton Woods, telles
qu'elles l'&#233;taient souvent dans les ann&#233;es 80, et qui "n'appartiennent" pas au pays, semblent
vou&#233;es &#224; l'&#233;chec.
<p>
Cependant, les distorsions qui ont surgi dans les &#233;conomies africaines sont si profondes qu'elles
ne pourraient &ecirc;tre r&#233;sorb&#233;es que par des r&#233;formes majeures soutenues pendant
plusieurs ann&#233;es et b&#233;n&#233;ficiant d'une aide ext&#233;rieure adapt&#233;e, en
g&#233;n&#233;rant ainsi des taux de croissance &#233;conomique qui se maintiendront au moins au
niveau des taux de croissance de la population de 3% ou plus. La distorsion principale r&#233;sulte de
la discrimination contre l'agriculture et l'industrie dans la fixation des prix, la fiscalit&#233;, le taux de
change et les autres politiques. Par cons&#233;quent, pour les jeunes sortant de l'&#233;cole, l'emploi
dans les services publics, l'&#233;ducation et les autres services repr&#233;sente le seul secteur
dynamique sur le march&#233; du travail. De plus, c'est dans ces services que les syndicats ont pris
tout leur essor, renfor&#231;ant les int&#233;r&ecirc;ts financiers de leurs employ&#233;s au
d&#233;triment de ceux des personnes travaillant dans l'agriculture et dans l'industrie. Cette
disparit&#233; dans les possibilit&#233;s de revenus n'a pas &#233;t&#233; constat&#233;e dans la
plupart des autres pays du monde en d&#233;veloppement. En Afrique elle a conduit, entre autres
probl&#232;mes, &#224; un probl&#232;me budg&#233;taire, &#224; savoir que 40% ou plus des
d&#233;penses gouvernementales &#233;taient consacr&#233;es aux salaires et appointements par
opposition &#224; pr&#232;s de 25% dans les autres pays en d&#233;veloppement. 
<p>
Une part de cette discrimination a pu &ecirc;tre r&#233;solue au cours des derni&#232;res ann&#233;es
par des mesures de r&#233;forme &#233;conomique souvent entreprises dans le cadre de programmes
d'ajustement structurel. Cependant, la situation critique des fonctionnaires, en particulier dans
certains anciens pays "sinistr&#233;s," comme l'Ouganda et le Mozambique, ne doit pas &ecirc;tre un
paravent &#224; la discrimination permanente en faveur du secteur public dans de nombreux autres
pays africains tant francophones qu' anglophones. Il reste encore beaucoup &#224; faire.
<p> 
Ces mesures de r&#233;forme &#233;conomique ont malheureusement elles-m&ecirc;mes
engendr&#233; un probl&#232;me au niveau de la r&#233;forme du service public, &#233;tant
donn&#233; qu'elles se sont sold&#233;es par des baisses et m&ecirc;me des taux inadapt&#233;s de
croissance &#233;conomique dans la plupart des pays africains. Par cons&#233;quent, pour les
fonctionnaires licenci&#233;s et les nouveaux arrivants sur le march&#233; du travail, ni l'agriculture,
ni l'industrie n'offrent de grandes possibilit&#233;s d'emploi.
<p>
Il reste maintenant &#224; esp&#233;rer que les pays soutiendront et acc&#233;l&#233;reront ces
programmes de r&#233;forme. Comme le soulignent de nombreux articles, la cr&#233;ation de
groupements de soutien est importante. Mais en fin de compte, une action disciplin&#233;e et
politiquement courageuse des gouvernements est in&#233;vitable. C'est le cas en particulier lorsque
des droits acquis dans des institutions favoris&#233;es et inefficaces ne r&#233;ussissent pas &#224;
offrir un soutien appropri&#233; permettant d'acc&#233;l&#233;rer l'introduction des mesures de
r&#233;forme.
<p>
Dans son article, Rasheed souligne le besoin "d'un agenda d&#233;taill&#233;" pour r&#233;former le
service public. On peut ajouter le fait que ces r&#233;formes ne seront accept&#233;es plus facilement
et appliqu&#233;es avec succ&#232;s que si elles s'assortissent de programmes macro-
&#233;conomiques qui g&#233;n&#232;rent une &#233;conomie plus dynamique. Ceci n'est pas du seul
ressort des gouvernements nationaux. Si le FMI et la Banque mondiale sont aussi impliqu&#233;s qu'ils
le pr&#233;tendent dans les programmes de r&#233;forme &#233;conomique pour r&#233;soudre les
distorsions dans les institutions et les politiques, notamment celles du service public, ils devraient
reconna&icirc;tre que ces programmes doivent &ecirc;tre assortis de politiques macro-
&#233;conomiques orient&#233;es vers la croissance. Une discipline macro-financi&#232;re est
essentielle &#224; la bonne sant&#233; des politiques &#233;conomiques. Cependant, ceci n'est pas
synonyme de restriction permanente.
<p>
Seule une &#233;conomie croissante permettra de rendre la r&#233;forme du service public plus
acceptable et de lui donner toute sa raison d'&ecirc;tre, &#224; savoir contribuer &#224; un taux plus
&#233;lev&#233; de croissance et de d&#233;veloppement des ressources humaines en Afrique.

La r&#233;forme du service public: Le point de vue du Commonwealth</h3>
par <i>Mohan Kaul</i>
<p>
Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans le <i>Bulletin DPMN</i>, 3(1) ao&#251;t
1995: pages 4 - 6
</center>
<hr>

<p>

Les principes de d&#233;veloppement d&#233;mocratique et de bonne
gouvernance ont &#233;t&#233; r&#233;it&#233;r&#233;s &#224; maintes occasions
par les chefs gouvernementaux du Commonwealth. Une administration saine et
responsable a &#233;t&#233; identifi&#233;e comme la cl&#233; essentielle de ces
objectifs. A cette fin, la division des services de formation et de gestion du
secr&#233;tariat du Commonwealth s'est engag&#233;e activement &#224; travailler
avec d'autres gouvernements membres. 
<p>
Malgr&#233; le fait que tous les pays ont d&ucirc; faire face &#224; des changements
globaux communs - politiques, sociaux, &#233;conomiques, technologiques,
environnementaux - notre travail avec les gouvernements a montr&#233; que, en
d&#233;pit de leurs nombreux points communs, les programmes de r&#233;forme
du service public &#233;taient tr&#232;s diff&#233;rents les uns des autres. Leur
divergence r&#233;sulte en grande partie de l'&#233;volution politique des
diff&#233;rents pays. Mais cette divergence mise de c&ocirc;t&#233;, la plupart des
pays du Commonwealth ont remis en question le r&ocirc;le du gouvernement dans
la planification et la gestion des politiques &#233;conomiques et sociales, et
multipli&#233; les politiques d'&#233;conomie lib&#233;rale. Ceci a
&#233;videmment influenc&#233; consid&#233;rablement la conception du
r&ocirc;le du service public. On le consid&#232;re maintenant plus comme un
catalyseur que comme un acteur dans l'activit&#233; &#233;conomique. 
<p>
<H3>Strat&#233;gies et th&#232;mes communs des programmes de r&#233;forme</H3>
<p>
Un ensemble de th&#232;mes communs est &#224; la base des r&#233;formes dans
les pays du Commonwealth. On peut identifier sept points:<P>
<H4><I>D&#233;veloppement politique et coordination</I></H4>
<p>
Le manque de structures efficaces permettant de mobiliser les capacit&#233;s
d'analyse politique, plut&ocirc;t que l'absence r&#233;elle ou l'insuffisance de ces
capacit&#233;s, a &#233;t&#233; identifi&#233; comme le point faible principal du
service public de nombreux pays en voie de d&#233;veloppement et de pays
d&#233;velopp&#233;s.
<p>
Certains pays abordent ce probl&#232;me en renfor&#231;ant les bureaux des
pr&#233;sident/premier ministre/cabinet par la mise en place d'unit&#233;s de
politiques (Royaume-Uni, Jama&iuml;que, Australie, Nouvelle-Z&#233;lande, Zambie).
Dans d'autres pays, des comit&#233;s interminist&#233;riels, ainsi que des
comit&#233;s sp&#233;ciaux de secr&#233;taires et des groupes de travail ont
&#233;t&#233; instaur&#233;s pour traiter les questions politiques particuli&#232;res
(Zambie, Malaisie). Dans d'autres pays encore, des forums nationaux impliquant les
secteurs priv&#233; et public ont &#233;t&#233; mis en place (Malaisie - Malaysia Inc.;
Ghana - Programme national pour le renouveau). Certains pays ont aussi
facilit&#233; la cr&#233;ation d'institutions ind&#233;pendantes d'analyse des
politiques. 
<p>
<H4><I>Mise en oeuvre des politiques</I></H4>
<p>
Les pays d&#233;velopp&#233;s et en voie de d&#233;veloppement adoptent
pareillement diverses approches pour revoir les relations structurelles entre la
formulation des politiques et leur mise en pratique, en retirant &#224; un noyau
renforc&#233; au centre des rouages gouvernementaux la responsabilit&#233; de
la mise en oeuvre de ces politiques. 
<p>
L'&#233;tablissement de conseils statutaires &#224; Singapour, de bureaux
ex&#233;cutifs au Royaume-Uni, et l'exp&#233;rience de corporatisation en Australie
ont permis de d&#233;finir clairement les fonctions relatives &#224; la formulation
des politiques et celles li&#233;es &#224; leur mise en pratique. Des secteurs
relativement exempts de contraintes bureaucratiques ont ainsi &#233;t&#233;
cr&#233;&#233;s, permettant l'instauration d'un climat plus fonctionnel.
L'&#233;tablissement d'une unit&#233; op&#233;rationnelle autour d'un ensemble
de fonctions clairement d&#233;limit&#233; permet de d&#233;velopper des
objectifs op&#233;rationnels, en donnant au personnel un sens plus pr&#233;cis de
sa mission. <p>
En outre, dans les pays en voie de d&#233;veloppement du Commonwealth en
particulier, de nombreux gouvernements d&#233;l&#232;guent les
responsabilit&#233;s aux niveaux territoriaux (r&#233;gionaux). Le Zimbabwe a
transf&#233;r&#233; les responsabilit&#233;s au gouvernement local dans les
domaines de la sant&#233;, de l'&#233;ducation et des affaires sociales. Le
Nig&#233;ria a cr&#233;&#233; des conseils f&#233;d&#233;raux de consultation et
de coordination et le Sri Lanka a &#233;tabli des conseils de province &#233;lus,
disposant de certains pouvoirs.
<p>
En Nouvelle-Z&#233;lande, les r&#233;formes appliqu&#233;es dans le domaine de
l'&#233;ducation illustrent le principe de la d&#233;centralisation. L'objectif de ces
r&#233;formes &#233;tait de supprimer le minist&#232;re de l'&#233;ducation qui
avait domin&#233; jusque l&#224; &#224; la fois les prises de d&#233;cision politiques
et la fourniture des services p&#233;dagogiques. 
<p>
<H4><I>Gestion des ressources humaines</I></H4>
<p>
Des syst&#232;mes am&#233;lior&#233;s de gestion des ressources humaines dans
le service public sont n&#233;cessaires pour encourager et r&#233;compenser les
r&#233;sultats des &#233;quipes et des individus. Augmenter l'autonomie des
bureaux et des minist&#232;res permettrait l'apport de nouveaut&#233;s dans la
r&#233;alisation, l'&#233;valuation et la r&#233;compense des r&#233;sultats
individuels. Cependant, cette augmentation de l'autonomie doit se faire dans le
respect des normes traditionnelles d'int&#233;grit&#233;, de m&#233;rite et de
professionnalisme du service public. Il s'agit l&#224; d'une question fondamentale
en Afrique du Sud o&ugrave; les programmes d'actions positives visant &#224; offrir
davantage d'emplois aux groupes mal repr&#233;sent&#233;s risquent
d'&#233;branler ces normes. 
<p>
Certains gouvernements testent avec succ&#232;s les conditions de travail flexibles
(Australie, Nouvelle-Z&#233;lande), le d&#233;placement des n&#233;gociations
collectives du service public vers les lieux de travail (Australie, Royaume-Uni),
l'application de la l&#233;gislation du secteur priv&#233; au secteur public (Nouvelle-
Z&#233;lande).
<p>
Certaines des &#233;conomies asiatiques parmi les plus prosp&#232;res soulignent
l'importance de recruter des gens talentueux et d'am&#233;liorer leurs
capacit&#233;s par le biais d'une formation permanente. Hongkong et Singapour
appliquent des m&#233;thodes de recrutement tr&#232;s strictes au niveau des
s&#233;lections, attirent les personnes ambitieuses pour parfaire leur formation,
et offrent des salaires comparables &#224; ceux du secteur priv&#233;. Singapour
n'a cess&#233; de porter syst&#233;matiquement son attention sur l'efficacit&#233;
comme seul crit&#232;re de maintien ou de renvoi des hauts fonctionnaires,
l'anciennet&#233; ne constituant plus la base d'avancement. De nombreux
secr&#233;taires permanents de Singapour sont relativement jeunes. Un exemple
instructif de d&#233;veloppements actuels dans ce domaine est fourni par le
gouvernement malaysien dont l'objectif est d'instaurer des institutions nationales
fondamentales capables d'offrir au personnel strat&#233;gique une formation
tr&#232;s cibl&#233;e. 
<p>
Des initiatives imaginatives de formation sont lanc&#233;es dans plusieurs pays. A
l'&icirc;le Maurice et au Royaume-Uni, la formation est adapt&#233;e au grade et
&#224; Singapour, au Ghana, en Australie, &#224; la Trinit&#233; et Tobago, une
formation au service client&#232;le a &#233;t&#233; introduite pour le personnel.
Le service public canadien favorise surtout la formation et le d&#233;veloppement
du personnel, en se concentrant en particulier sur le rapport
co&ucirc;t/efficacit&#233;. 
<p>
Ces efforts pour &#233;quilibrer le service public sont renforc&#233;s par le besoin
de freiner l'augmentation des d&#233;penses publiques et d'assurer un service
r&#233;duit et efficace. A cette fin, la Malaisie a mis en place un comit&#233;
directeur de r&#233;duction de la taille du service public, charg&#233; de
consid&#233;rer des changements dans le syst&#232;me administratif, les
institutions, les postes et le personnel. Au Zimbabwe, la r&#233;duction de la taille
du service public est un point cl&#233; du programme de r&#233;forme. 
<p>
<H4><I>Philosophie organisationnelle</I></H4>
<p>
Il est &#233;vident que l'on reconna&icirc;t de plus en plus l'importance de
d&#233;velopper un service orient&#233; vers le client, de clarifier la
responsabilit&#233; du service public et de d&#233;velopper un meilleur contact
avec le public en introduisant des approches de gestion de qualit&#233; et en
d&#233;veloppant un g&#233;nie du secteur public. Ces objectifs exigent la
formulation d'une philosophie de travail bas&#233;e sur la qualit&#233;, les
r&#233;sultats et la transparence. Le but des r&#233;formes est de d&#233;velopper
une philosophie organisationnelle qui devrait se manifester par un plus grand
engagement des employ&#233;s, par des primes pour le travail de groupe et la
perfection individuelle et par la consultation avec les clients et les usagers. Les
valeurs du secteur public sont formul&#233;es dans des codes de moralit&#233; au
sein du gouvernement.
<p>
Singapour a &#233;t&#233; le premier service public &#224; introduire des
&#233;quipes d'am&#233;lioration du travail (WITS). Ces &#233;quipes ont
&#233;t&#233; form&#233;es &#224; partir des cercles de contr&ocirc;le de la
qualit&#233; auxquels ont recours les entreprises prosp&#232;res et innovatrices du
secteur priv&#233; pour permettre aux groupes d'employ&#233;s de diff&#233;rents
niveaux de discuter ouvertement des obstacles rencontr&#233;s dans la
qualit&#233; et pour concevoir des solutions pratiques en faveur de
l'am&#233;lioration du service. Le gouvernement du Botswana a introduit en 1993
un programme d'am&#233;lioration de la productivit&#233; et de la qualit&#233; en
cr&#233;ant des WITS au sein des diff&#233;rentes institutions et des diff&#233;rents
minist&#232;res. Le programme malaysien visant &#224; encourager des attitudes
positives est un bon exemple d'approche pratique de la mise en place de valeurs
conformes dans un secteur public entrepreneurial.
<p>
<H4><I>Commercialisation et d&#233;veloppement du partenariat avec le secteur
priv&#233; et les ONG</I></H4>
<p>
La r&#233;forme du service public a &#233;t&#233; consid&#233;rablement
influenc&#233;e par la remise en question du r&ocirc;le du gouvernement dans la
fourniture des services. Suite &#224; des &#233;tudes r&#233;alis&#233;es sur les
fonctions gouvernementales, la question s'est pos&#233;e de savoir si un travail
devait r&#233;ellement &ecirc;tre entrepris, s'il devait &ecirc;tre entrepris
directement par le gouvernement, par des commissionnaires pay&#233;s par le
gouvernement ou par le secteur priv&#233;.
<p>
Le minist&#232;re des finances du Royaume-Uni a donn&#233; aux bureaux
gouvernementaux des conseils pr&#233;cis pour &#233;tudier le march&#233;,
chaque bureau ayant &#224; identifier des candidats dans le cadre de cette
&#233;tude. Le march&#233; de la sous-traitance a &#233;t&#233; &#233;prouv&#233;
&#224; l'int&#233;rieur du gouvernement.
<p>
Bien que les services sp&#233;cialis&#233;s aient toujours &#233;t&#233; fournis par
le secteur priv&#233; et les ONG, le d&#233;veloppement des techniques
d'&#233;tudes de march&#233; fournit une strat&#233;gie permettant
d'&#233;valuer la capacit&#233; du march&#233; &#224; fournir des biens ou des
services que l'on consid&#233;rait autrefois comme le privil&#232;ge du
gouvernement. En m&ecirc;me temps, il est n&#233;cessaire d'&#233;viter de
d&#233;savantager la position concurrentielle des entit&#233;s gouvernementales.
A cet &#233;gard, l'Etat australien de la Nouvelle-Galles du Sud a pris des mesures
pour garantir au secteur public un m&ecirc;me niveau de comp&#233;tition. 
<p>
A la Trinit&#233; et Tobago, les d&#233;partements minist&#233;riels ont
&#233;t&#233; consult&#233;s pour d&#233;terminer si oui ou non un service
pouvait &ecirc;tre fourni de mani&#232;re plus efficace par un bureau
ext&#233;rieur. Les services d'entretien des nouveaux postes de police, les services
de s&#233;curit&#233; et de distribution du courrier entre l'a&#233;roport Piarco
et la poste centrale sont d&#233;j&#224; sous-trait&#233;s. 
<p>
Le d&#233;veloppement du partenariat avec les ONG et le secteur priv&#233; s'est
r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; &ecirc;tre un &#233;l&#233;ment strat&#233;gique dans
l'application de certaines politiques et de certains programmes de
d&#233;veloppement. Par exemple, au Bangladesh, le gouvernement coop&#232;re
avec succ&#232;s avec la Banque GRAMEEN pour &#233;laborer des programmes qui
dirigent les b&#233;n&#233;fices vers les secteurs pauvres de la soci&#233;t&#233;.
L'Inde a &#233;galement eu des exp&#233;riences positives quant au r&ocirc;le des
ONG dans l'application de programmes de d&#233;veloppement &#233;ducatif et
rural. 
<p>
<H4><I>Planification financi&#232;re et syst&#232;mes de contr&ocirc;le</I></H4>
<p>
Des r&#233;formes structurelles et institutionnelles majeures se sont produites en
gestion financi&#232;re, rendant cette derni&#232;re plus performante et plus
orient&#233;e vers le rendement. Parmi les autres d&#233;veloppements dans ce
domaine, citons l'allocation d'une prime d'efficacit&#233; aux bureaux
minist&#233;riels (Royaume-Uni, Australie), la r&#233;mun&#233;ration des services
gouvernementaux internes par les minist&#232;res (Australie) et des pr&#233;visions
financi&#232;res de trois ans (Malte, Australie).
<p>
En Nouvelle-Z&#233;lande, les r&#233;formes de gestion financi&#232;re ont
illustr&#233; au mieux l'importance d'adopter des m&#233;thodes de gestion
appropri&#233;es. Une comptabilit&#233; des apports de fonds compl&#232;te les
syst&#232;mes de comptabilit&#233; de la tr&#233;sorerie, afin d'assurer que les
informations financi&#232;res disponibles pour la gestion sont d'actualit&#233; et
qu'elles permettent une analyse sens&#233;e de l'utilisation des ressources &#224;
l'int&#233;rieur d'un bureau minist&#233;riel. 
<p>
L'imp&ocirc;t sur le capital assure l'accaparement total des produits de l'emploi
alternatif des capitaux immobilis&#233;s &#224; l'int&#233;rieur des services. En fait,
l'imp&ocirc;t sur le capital est de plus en plus r&#233;pandu et refl&#232;te la
pr&#233;occupation publique croissante quant &#224; la garantie que les
immobilisations sont pleinement utilis&#233;es et qu'elles sont
consid&#233;r&#233;es comme des investissements exigeant une gestion judicieuse.
Ces proc&#233;dures financi&#232;res visent &#224; introduire une discipline de
tarification totale et de march&#233; dans le cadre de laquelle les services
gouvernementaux peuvent totalement &ecirc;tre remis en question, encourageant
ainsi une meilleure efficacit&#233; et une &#233;conomie plus prosp&#232;re.
<p>
<H4><I>Informatique</I></H4>
<p>
L'informatique a &#233;t&#233; introduite comme une des strat&#233;gies
fondamentales de la r&#233;forme du service public. Elle est d&#233;sormais
consid&#233;r&#233;e comme un &#233;l&#233;ment essentiel de
l'am&#233;lioration des services, en particulier parce que les gouvernements, au
niveau mondial, doivent faire face &#224; une tendance de plus en plus
marqu&#233;e vers une production bas&#233;e sur le savoir et vers des
communications en pleine mutation. Les d&#233;penses gouvernementales pour
l'achat d'ordinateurs et de syst&#232;mes informatiques de gestion se sont accrues
rapidement dans beaucoup de pays et elles occupent maintenant des postes
essentiels dans leurs budgets.
<p>
Des programmes significatifs d'informatisation ont &#233;t&#233; appliqu&#233;s
en Australie, &#224; Singapour, au Royaume-Uni, en Malaisie, &#224; Malte et &#224;
l'&icirc;le Maurice. L'encaissement des revenus, la gestion financi&#232;re et les
communications interminist&#233;rielles ont particuli&#232;rement
b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; de ces programmes. L'informatique a &#233;galement
permis d'assurer une meilleure liaison avec les clients en d&#233;veloppant des
centres de services non permanents/ permanents et des syst&#232;mes
d'information publics en Malaisie.
<p>
De nombreux gouvernements ont formul&#233; des politiques relatives &#224;
l'utilisation &#233;tendue des ordinateurs et de l'informatique (par exemple, au
Canada) et ont &#233;tabli dans le gouvernement des unit&#233;s charg&#233;es
d'encourager leur usage (Singapour, Malaisie, Malte, Royaume-Uni).
<p>
<H3>Conclusions</H3>
<p>
R&#233;duire la taille du service public et changer le r&ocirc;le du gouvernement,
tout en restant efficace face aux d&#233;fis complexes que ces objectifs impliquent,
a &#233;t&#233; un des buts pr&#233;pond&#233;rants des r&#233;formes du service
public dans les pays du Commonwealth. Mais alors que les objectifs
g&#233;n&#233;raux dans chaque pays sont similaires, pas une seule solution ou
approche n'a pu &ecirc;tre d&#233;gag&#233;e comme mod&#232;le universel. De
plus, autant de le&#231;ons sont &#224; tirer des exp&#233;riences r&#233;ussies des
pays en d&#233;veloppement que celles des pays d&#233;velopp&#233;s. Chaque
pays doit identifier ses priorit&#233;s en fonction des conjonctures locales en
faisant appel &#224; l'ensemble des exp&#233;riences des pays
d&#233;velopp&#233;s et des pays en d&#233;veloppement. 
<p>
En r&#233;sum&#233;, les pays ont &#224; &#233;laborer des solutions locales &#224;
des probl&#232;mes globaux. En outre, le succ&#232;s d&#233;pend d'une approche
suppl&#233;mentaire: un processus progressif con&#231;u dans le cadre d'une vision
pr&#233;cise &#224; long terme. 
<p>
Il faut aussi prendre conscience que ce sont des individus qui sont au coeur du
service public et que c'est par cons&#233;quent la gestion des ressources humaines,
et non la technologie ni les forces du march&#233;, qui doit &ecirc;tre au centre
des programmes de r&#233;forme du service public. Alors que les individus sont le
coeur du changement, ses architectes et ses b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires, ils peuvent
aussi en &ecirc;tre les perdants et par cons&#233;quent les opposants. Ainsi,
l'application de reformes est un travail tr&#232;s d&#233;licat et tr&#232;s difficile.
Dans ce contexte, l'engagement dans le processus de r&#233;forme d'individus
talentueux, qui comprennent et soutiennent ce changement, est tr&#232;s
important. Les gouvernements doivent renforcer le pouvoir de ceux qui
coop&#232;rent au changement. 
<p>
Enfin, le service public ne doit pas seulement faire partie du processus de
changement international et national en cours, il doit &ecirc;tre au premier rang
du processus, c'est-&#224;-dire guider, initier, innover et g&#233;rer le changement.

D&#233;mocratisation de la r&#233;forme administrative au B&#233;nin, au Burkina

<hr>

<p>

Depuis leur ind&#233;pendance, les pays de l'Afrique francophone ont soulign&#233; le besoin
d'&#233;tablir des structures administratives efficaces destin&#233;es &#224; prendre la rel&#232;ve
de leurs anciennes administrations coloniales. Ce processus a &#233;t&#233; in&#233;vitablement
tr&#232;s rapide et dans une certaine mesure, on peut le juger, avec le recul, comme &#233;tant
devenu trop excessif et inefficace &#224; de nombreux &#233;gards. Ainsi, pendant les ann&#233;es
70, des mesures ont &#233;t&#233; prises avec l'aide de l'ILO et du PNUD pour am&#233;liorer la
qualit&#233; g&#233;n&#233;rale, la formation, l'organisation et la gestion administrative tant au
niveau central qu'au niveau local du gouvernement. 
<p>
Pendant les ann&#233;es 80, ces efforts ont &#233;t&#233; largement supplant&#233;s par l'implication
dominante du FMI et de la Banque mondiale. Cet engagement s'est concr&#233;tis&#233; par leur
soutien des programmes d'ajustement structurel. Les mesures de diminution du co&ucirc;t
budg&#233;taire total du service public, principalement par des r&#233;ductions majeures d'effectifs,
ont &#233;t&#233; des points importants de ces programmes. Des licenciements volontaires et
cibl&#233;s, l'abolition des irr&#233;gularit&#233;s d'emploi, et les gels de salaires ont &#233;t&#233;
introduits, en m&ecirc;me temps que la cr&#233;ation de d&#233;partements minist&#233;riels pour
la gestion des salaires. La concentration presque totale sur la r&#233;duction du co&ucirc;t
budg&#233;taire des fonctionnaires a laiss&#233; tr&#232;s peu de place pour satisfaire les conditions
locales et les aspects sociaux du processus d'ajustement.
<p>
Cependant, cette situation dans laquelle les gouvernements ont &#233;t&#233; pris entre les
institutions de Bretton Woods (qui ont &#233;tabli en grande partie l'ordre du jour des politiques
d'ajustement &#233;conomique et structurel) et la population (qui a souffert de ces politiques) a
engendr&#233; un environnement de lib&#233;ralisation &#233;conomique et de d&#233;mocratisation
politique plus importantes. Les trois pays se sont par cons&#233;quent concentr&#233;s sur le besoin
de r&#233;aliser trois conditions pr&#233;alables &#224; la modernisation r&#233;ussie de leurs
administrations publiques:
<p>
Premi&#232;rement, assurer l'engagement du gouvernement dans la r&#233;forme du service public
en red&#233;finissant simultan&#233;ment le r&ocirc;le des bureaux ext&#233;rieurs;
Deuxi&#232;mement, assurer l'engagement des fonctionnaires dans la r&#233;forme;
Troisi&#232;mement, assurer la participation de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile dans le processus de la
r&#233;forme.
<p>
<H3>R&ocirc;le des agences ext&#233;rieures</H3>
<p>
Dans les trois pays, les agences ext&#233;rieures ont jou&#233; un r&ocirc;le bien trop
pr&#233;dominant dans les tentatives pr&#233;c&#233;dentes de r&#233;forme du service public pour
laisser esp&#233;rer que ces programmes de r&#233;forme puissent &ecirc;tre appliqu&#233;s avec
succ&#232;s. Le r&#233;sultat a &#233;t&#233; un mod&#232;le uniformis&#233; et simplifi&#233;,
bas&#233; sur les pr&#233;jug&#233;s d'experts internationaux et ne prenant pas en compte le
caract&#232;re unique des situations historiques et socioculturelles de chaque pays. En outre, l'aide
ext&#233;rieure en faveur de la r&#233;forme du service public a &#233;t&#233; tr&#232;s
co&ucirc;teuse et s'est prolong&#233;e d&#233;mesur&#233;ment, surtout si on la compare aux
r&#233;sultats atteints (par exemple, le projet PNUD au Mali a dur&#233; de 1970 &#224; 1991). Ce
m&#233;diocre rapport co&ucirc;t-profits a &#233;t&#233; aggrav&#233; par l'implication de plusieurs
agences ext&#233;rieures dans chaque pays et par la croissance cons&#233;quente d'une multitude
d'organismes de coordination: au Burkina Faso, quatre structures de coordination ont &#233;t&#233;
mises en place rien pour un seul projet. De plus, l'objectif exclusif de r&#233;duction du personnel et
des salaires inscrit dans le cadre des programmes d'ajustement structurel a incit&#233; les officiels et
leurs repr&#233;sentants syndicaux &#224; r&#233;duire leur soutien &#224; la r&#233;forme ces
derni&#232;res ann&#233;es. Au B&#233;nin, par exemple, le terme "r&#233;forme administrative" est
d&#233;sormais associ&#233; aux programmes de licenciement. 
<p>
La r&#233;forme du service public n'a aucun espoir d'&ecirc;tre introduite et soutenue efficacement,
&#224; moins que le gouvernement ne commence par affirmer sa volont&#233; politique. Le
pr&#233;sident Soglo au B&#233;nin, lors de sa campagne pr&#233;sidentielle, et le pr&#233;sident
Compaor&#233; au Burkina Faso, lors du sommet social des NU, ont tous deux soulign&#233;
l'importance d'une r&#233;forme administrative dans leur pays. Le premier ministre du Mali les a suivi
et les trois gouvernements n'ont cess&#233; depuis lors de commenter le besoin de r&#233;forme et
des priorit&#233;s &#224; accorder dans leurs programmes de r&#233;forme. 
<p>
En outre, les trois gouvernements ont admis que l'affirmation d'une volont&#233; politique de
r&#233;forme devait se traduire par des faits r&#233;els. Leurs politiques &#233;conomiques ont
insist&#233; sur les limites des d&#233;penses gouvernementales et sur une modification en faveur
des secteurs prioritaires de l'&#233;conomie. De plus, des actions organisationnelles ont &#233;t&#233;
entreprises pour refl&#233;ter l'importance d'une r&#233;forme administrative. Au B&#233;nin et au
Burkina Faso, par exemple, un minist&#232;re a &#233;t&#233; charg&#233; de la r&#233;forme
administrative ou de la modernisation du service public. Il a &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; admis que
la r&#233;forme exigeait que tous les ministres reconnaissent leur responsabilit&#233;, &#224;
l'int&#233;rieur de leur bureau, vis-&#224;-vis de la conception et de l'application des programmes de
r&#233;forme. 
<p>
<H3>Mobilisation des fonctionnaires</H3>
<p>
L'exp&#233;rience montre que le service public ne peut &ecirc;tre r&#233;form&#233; sans la
participation et la collaboration actives des fonctionnaires. On peut y parvenir &#224; travers des
organismes statuaires communs tels que le conseil consultatif du service public. Ces dispositions
permettent aux hauts fonctionnaires d'&ecirc;tre repr&#233;sent&#233;s dans des organismes
gouvernementaux par des repr&#233;sentants &#233;lus dans un contexte d'&#233;galit&#233;. Ces
dispositions peuvent &#233;videmment &ecirc;tre &#224; double tranchant et un conflit entre les
repr&#233;sentants du personnel et le gouvernement n'est pas &#224; exclure. Ceci discr&#233;diterait
le processus de r&#233;forme et pourrait aboutir, comme au Mali, &#224; la radicalisation des
fonctionnaires et &#224; leur rejet en 1991 des accords sur une structure organisationnelle
r&#233;vis&#233;e du service public.
<p>
Des dispositions institutionnelles &#233;labor&#233;es ont &#233;t&#233; mises en place au Burkina
Faso afin de syst&#233;matiser et renforcer le processus de participation. Un conseil de gestion
compos&#233; de directeurs d&#233;partementaux et de repr&#233;sentants du personnel a
&#233;t&#233; instaur&#233; dans chaque conseil d'administration des d&#233;partements
ext&#233;rieurs. Ce conseil de gestion est charg&#233; de la planification et du contr&ocirc;le de
l'application de mesures visant &#224; renforcer la gestion des ressources humaines, mat&#233;rielles
et financi&#232;res &#224; l'int&#233;rieur du conseil d'administration. De m&ecirc;me, un conseil
consultatif des secteurs minist&#233;riels a &#233;t&#233; cr&#233;&#233; dans chaque minist&#232;re
pour &#233;tudier les politiques sectorielles, la gestion du personnel et les performances
g&#233;n&#233;rales du minist&#232;re. L'introduction d'une conf&#233;rence annuelle de
l'administration publique est encore plus ambitieuse. Son but est de fournir une &#233;valuation
permanente de l'action administrative pour r&#233;pondre "au d&#233;sir d'avoir un service public
modernis&#233; plus proche de la population et r&#233;solument orient&#233; vers le progr&#232;s"
(Premier ministre). Cette conf&#233;rence annuelle vise &#224; rassembler les d&#233;cideurs et les
technocrates. La totalit&#233; de ces initiatives institutionnelles au Burkina Faso a &#233;t&#233;
con&#231;ue pour s'assurer que les hauts fonctionnaires aient le sentiment d'&ecirc;tre
concern&#233;s par les probl&#232;mes de leur d&#233;partement et de leur minist&#232;re. On est
tent&#233; de consid&#233;rer cet objectif comme r&#233;ussi.
<p>
On consid&#232;re que l'am&#233;lioration de l'expertise est d'une importance fondamentale pour
r&#233;aliser les objectifs des programmes de r&#233;forme. Une fois encore, le Burkina Faso offre un
bon exemple d'actions entreprises &#224; cet &#233;gard. La deuxi&#232;me conf&#233;rence annuelle
de l'administration, qui a eu lieu en janvier de cette ann&#233;e, a conseill&#233; la mise en place d'un
comit&#233; de travail charg&#233; de proposer des m&#233;thodes permettant de r&#233;aliser cette
modernisation, notamment en instaurant un centre national en faveur de la promotion de l'expertise
nationale. Elle a aussi recommand&#233; de r&#233;diger des propositions qui inciteraient davantage
les hauts fonctionnaires &#224; am&#233;liorer leurs comp&#233;tences techniques en participant
&#224; des conf&#233;rences scientifiques, en r&#233;digeant des articles destin&#233;s &#224;
&ecirc;tre publi&#233;s, et en s'engageant davantage dans la pr&#233;paration, la r&#233;alisation et
l'&#233;valuation de projets.
<p>
Au niveau r&#233;gional, les dirigeants des services publics de vingt pays se sont rencontr&#233;s en
novembre 1994 &#224; l'OFPA et ont lanc&#233; une initiative pour la cr&#233;ation d'un R&#233;seau
africain de service public. Le but de ce r&#233;seau est de coordonner l'action des r&#233;seaux
nationaux compos&#233;s de praticiens, chercheurs, formateurs, et consultants ind&#233;pendants.
Dans le futur, cette liste sera compl&#233;t&#233;e par des experts expatri&#233;s, cr&#233;ant ainsi
un groupe de r&#233;flexion sur la r&#233;forme du service public.
<p>
<H3>Participation de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile</H3>
<p>
Dans les trois pays, le nombre et l'influence d'associations socioprofessionnelles et d'autres
organisations non gouvernementales augmentent. Ceci est un signe de renaissance de la
soci&#233;t&#233; civile en tant que contrepoids n&#233;cessaire au gouvernement, pilier de la
soci&#233;t&#233; d&#233;mocratique. Ses membres ont tout int&#233;r&ecirc;t &#224; garantir un
service public qui offre une structure efficace des activit&#233;s gouvernementales &#224;
l'int&#233;rieur de laquelle ils peuvent eux-m&ecirc;mes op&#233;rer. Par cons&#233;quent, il est
important que les gouvernements leur fournissent davantage d'informations sur les activit&#233;s du
service public et qu'ils les mobilisent chaque fois qu'ils peuvent contribuer &#224; am&#233;liorer
l'efficacit&#233; du service public.
<p>
Ces objectifs peuvent &ecirc;tre atteints en instaurant un organe permanent de consultation, ainsi que
des m&#233;canismes con&#231;us &#224; des fins pr&#233;cises. Par exemple, pour cr&#233;er ce
partenariat, le Burkina Faso a collabor&#233; avec l'industrie cin&#233;matographique &#224; la
production de films illustrant les pratiques et le comportement des fonctionnaires. Un film a
&#233;t&#233; r&#233;compens&#233; lors du festival africain du film de cette ann&#233;e. De
m&ecirc;me, au B&#233;nin, la fondation Friedrich Ebert a collabor&#233; avec la t&#233;l&#233;vision
nationale pour produire des sketchs destin&#233;s au gouvernement et exposant les attitudes des
fonctionnaires face aux usagers et les invitant &#224; corriger leurs comportements. Au B&#233;nin
aussi, des artistes ont &#233;t&#233; invit&#233;s &#224; concevoir des affiches pour d&#233;corer les
murs des bureaux. 
<p>
Il est n&#233;cessaire de consolider de telles initiatives, par exemple, par des sondages d'opinion
r&#233;guliers, et par la disponibilit&#233; de m&#233;canismes permettant aux usagers des services
gouvernementaux de faire conna&icirc;tre leurs opinions au gouvernement. De plus, l'adh&#233;sion
aux organismes consultatifs gouvernementaux a besoin de s'&#233;tendre et d'inclure davantage de
professionnels exp&#233;riment&#233;s issus des secteurs priv&#233;s et non gouvernementaux. Au
Mali un sondage men&#233; en 1992 aupr&#232;s de 164 organismes consultatifs a confirm&#233; "une
sur-repr&#233;sentation des fonctionnaires, une sous-repr&#233;sentation des personnes
qualifi&#233;es du secteur priv&#233; et une absence quasi totale des repr&#233;sentants des
associations." Un comit&#233; de modernisation du service public a d&#232;s lors &#233;t&#233; mis
en place auquel participent, en plus des membres administratifs et des syndicats, des
repr&#233;sentants des associations des usagers du service public.
<p>
Des efforts ont &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; entrepris pour mobiliser les capacit&#233;s et les
int&#233;r&ecirc;ts de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile. Ainsi, en 1994, le gouvernement a organis&#233; un
atelier afin de pr&#233;parer le terrain pour un "plan de d&#233;veloppement institutionnel." Cet
atelier comptait non seulement des membres du gouvernement, mais aussi ceux des professions
juridiques, des hommes d'affaires, des consultants ind&#233;pendants et des repr&#233;sentants des
partenaires du d&#233;veloppement au Mali. De m&ecirc;me, le B&#233;nin a instaur&#233;
l'ann&#233;e derni&#232;re un comit&#233; national pour la r&#233;forme administrative,
compos&#233; non seulement de repr&#233;sentants politiques et administratifs, mais aussi de
personnes externes au gouvernement.
<p>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<p>
La raison d'&ecirc;tre de l'ensemble de toutes ces dispositions institutionnelles et organisationnelles
repose sur la reconnaissance progressive par les trois gouvernements et, je le crois, en Afrique en
g&#233;n&#233;ral, de la n&#233;cessit&#233; d'une participation active et fondamentale des acteurs
et des parties prenantes de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile dans les programmes de r&#233;forme des
services publics. Mais ce ph&#233;nom&#232;ne traduit &#224; son tour une reconnaissance croissante
selon laquelle la r&#233;forme du service public doit &ecirc;tre abord&#233;e comme un processus
&#224; long terme et permanent et non comme un probl&#232;me que l'on peut r&#233;soudre par
des arrangements rapides, en particulier lorsque ceux-ci sont impos&#233;s par des organismes
ext&#233;rieurs qui ne reconnaissent ou n'appr&#233;cient pas les particularit&#233;s socio- politico-
&#233;conomiques uniques de chaque pays.

<p>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<p>
A leur ind&#233;pendance, les gouvernements africains ont h&#233;rit&#233; de structures
administratives adapt&#233;es aux besoins des puissances coloniales. Il existait peu de liens avec les
syst&#232;mes gouvernementaux autochtones et ces puissances &#233;taient davantage
concern&#233;es par l'extraction des ressources naturelles que par le d&#233;veloppement
&#233;conomique et humain. En outre, les pays ind&#233;pendants se sont trouv&#233;s
confront&#233;s non seulement au besoin d'instaurer un syst&#232;me gouvernemental complet, mais
aussi au fait qu'ils devaient le faire dans un contexte de changement &#233;conomique et
technologique sans pr&#233;c&#233;dent. A ce tourbillon de changements s'est ajout&#233;, au cours
des dix derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, un changement cataclysmique: le changement id&#233;ologique
r&#233;pandu et fondamental concernant le r&ocirc;le de l'Etat dans le processus de
d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique. Cette mutation a permis de jeter un regard nouveau sur le
secteur priv&#233; en tant que moteur principal de croissance dans le cadre des march&#233;s et des
prix libres. 
<p>
Cependant, on a tr&#232;s t&ocirc;t consid&#233;r&#233; que cette commutation des strat&#233;gies
engendr&#233;e par cette id&#233;ologie n&#233;olib&#233;rale courait le danger d'aller trop loin et
de nuire &#224; la productivit&#233;. En dehors de l'importance de l'Etat dans la fourniture des
services relatifs &#224; la loi, l'ordre, la justice, la d&#233;fense, l'infrastructure, l'&#233;ducation et la
sant&#233;, il a &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; admis que les institutions du march&#233; libre ne
peuvent fonctionner que si les institutions gouvernementales fonctionnement elles aussi.
<p>
De plus, le d&#233;veloppement r&#233;el d'une structure politique capable dans le cadre de laquelle
des secteurs non gouvernementaux peuvent fonctionner de mani&#232;re plus efficace exige que l'on
mette davantage l'accent sur la disponibit&#233; d'une capacit&#233; institutionnelle forte &#224;
g&#233;rer la politique &#233;conomique (son application, son contr&ocirc;le et la formulation
r&#233;elle de politiques). La r&#233;forme du service public et le renforcement des capacit&#233;s
sont donc &#224; nouveau prioritaires dans l'agenda des politiques de d&#233;veloppement. Mais la
difficult&#233; porte toujours sur la meilleure fa&#231;on d'agir dans les conditions actuelles des pays
africains.<P>
<H3>Obstacles </H3>
<p>
Premi&#232;rement, il existe un paradoxe. Plus le processus de r&#233;forme est global et complexe,
plus la capacit&#233; de gestion exig&#233;e pour appliquer ce processus est importante. Cependant,
les pays qui ont le plus grand besoin de r&#233;formes sont souvent, et ce n'est pas surprenant, ceux
qui ont la plus faible capacit&#233; &#224; g&#233;rer ce processus. Affecter un plus grand nombre
de cadres exp&#233;riment&#233;s aux besoins de la r&#233;forme du service public am&#232;ne
in&#233;vitablement &#224; l&#233;ser les autres domaines de politique et de r&#233;forme
institutionnelle, qui sont tout aussi importants pour la r&#233;alisation des objectifs de
d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique. Des choix difficiles dans la r&#233;partition de cette faible
capacit&#233; de gestion sont in&#233;vitables. Le cas se produit d&#233;j&#224;: le domaine
limit&#233;, encore que consid&#233;rable, de la gestion de la politique macro-financi&#232;re a
tendance &#224; &ecirc;tre prioritaire &#224; cet &#233;gard. On peut &#233;videmment
pr&#233;tendre que le but principal de la r&#233;forme du service public est pr&#233;cis&#233;ment
d'accro&icirc;tre son efficacit&#233; et ainsi de renforcer sa capacit&#233; &#224; g&#233;rer tous les
aspects de la politique &#233;conomique et sociale. Par cons&#233;quent, on pourrait affirmer que
la plus grande priorit&#233; devrait &ecirc;tre accord&#233;e &#224; ce domaine. Bien que ceci puisse
s'av&#233;rer exact &#224; long terme, cela ne r&#233;duit en rien la difficult&#233; &#224; prendre
des d&#233;cisions au jour le jour, en particulier lorsque la plupart des gouvernements ont tendance
&#224; juger leur esp&#233;rance de vie &#224; court terme plut&ocirc;t qu'&#224; long terme.
<p>
Deuxi&#232;mement, il est n&#233;cessaire d'assurer la faisabilit&#233; des r&#233;formes dans
l'environnement politique, &#233;conomique et culturel existant et de garantir leur soutien par les
fonctionnaires. Un paradoxe appara&icirc;t une fois de plus. D'un c&ocirc;t&#233;, la r&#233;forme
implique des changements majeurs (souvent contradictoires) dans les compensations financi&#232;res,
les esp&#233;rances professionnelles, la s&#233;curit&#233; de l'emploi et autres conditions de travail
des fonctionnaires, g&#233;n&#233;rant in&#233;vitablement une atmosph&#232;re d'incertitude et
de malaise au sein du service. La r&#233;ussite de la r&#233;forme exige pourtant le soutien et
l'engagement des fonctionnaires. Gr&#226;ce &#224; leur connaissance des m&#233;canismes de
fonctionnement de l'administration publique, ils sont les plus aptes &#224; contribuer de
mani&#232;re significative &#224; l'introduction de mesures de r&#233;forme sens&#233;es et
applicables. L'absence de leur soutien peut entra&icirc;ner des retards et, dans les cas extr&ecirc;mes,
le blocage du processus de r&#233;forme. L'application effective des r&#233;formes exige que les
fonctionnaires de chaque service fassent preuve d'un niveau &#233;lev&#233; de moralit&#233;, de
professionnalisme et de loyaut&#233; (tout ce qui peut &ecirc;tre menac&#233; par les mesures de
r&#233;forme). 
<p>
Troisi&#232;mement, &#233;tant donn&#233; que la plupart des programmes de r&#233;forme du
service public ont &#233;t&#233; introduits en tant qu'&#233;l&#233;ments des programmes
d'ajustement structurel, ils ont &#233;t&#233; consid&#233;r&#233;s comme &#233;tant impos&#233;s
par l'ext&#233;rieur, par le FMI et la Banque mondiale, ou du moins consid&#233;r&#233;s comme tels.
Par ailleurs, ces programmes se pr&#233;occupant principalement de l'aspect macro-financier, ces
r&#233;formes se sont concentr&#233;es presque exclusivement sur la r&#233;duction du co&ucirc;t
budg&#233;taire du service public &#224; travers la diminution des niveaux des effectifs et des salaires.
<p>
Le dernier obstacle &#224; la r&#233;forme est l'absence des exp&#233;riences men&#233;es
r&#233;cemment sur les r&#233;formes, o&ugrave; que ce soit, &#224; un niveau jug&#233;
n&#233;cessaire dans les pays africains. Les mod&#232;les copi&#233;s sur des exp&#233;riences de pays
d&#233;velopp&#233;s sont largement hors de propos, en particulier parce que, dans leurs pratiques
et leurs m&#233;thodes plus institutionnalis&#233;es, tout changement introduit est habituellement
soutenu par des "filets de s&#233;curit&#233;" institutionnels qui ne sont pas disponibles en Afrique.
De plus, les pratiques de gestion du secteur priv&#233; import&#233;es dans certains pays ne se sont
pas toujours transplant&#233;es avec succ&#232;s, en partie parce que la r&#233;forme parall&#232;le
des proc&#233;dures de contr&ocirc;le et de r&#233;vision exig&#233;e pour introduire ces pratiques
ne s'op&#232;re pas simultan&#233;ment.
<p>
<H3>Aides -- conditions pour une r&#233;forme r&#233;ussie</H3>
<p>
Malgr&#233; les obstacles, il est encore possible d'identifier certains des &#233;l&#233;ments communs
&#224; plusieurs des programmes les plus r&#233;ussis. Ces programmes sont illustr&#233;s par
r&#233;f&#233;rence aux pays de l'Afrique anglophone. Il est cependant int&#233;ressant de noter que
les cl&#233;s du succ&#232;s sont tr&#232;s proches de celles identifi&#233;es dans les pays africains
francophones par Fofana dans son article. 
<p>
Premi&#232;rement, un soutien politique explicite des mesures de r&#233;forme est indispensable sur
une p&#233;riode prolong&#233;e. Il permet de garantir que les r&#233;formes seront soutenues dans
le temps. En Angleterre, le long r&#232;gne de Madame Thatcher au poste de Premier ministre
pendant les ann&#233;es 80 fournit un exemple &#233;vident d'engagement fort envers des
r&#233;formes profondes permettant d'op&#233;rer des changements dans les structures et le
comportement organisationnels, consid&#233;r&#233;s jusque l&#224; comme impossibles. En Afrique,
il convient de noter que le Ghana et l'Ouganda, qui ont entrepris tous deux la r&#233;forme du service
public avec succ&#232;s, ont b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; d'une stabilit&#233; politique et d'une
continuit&#233; de gouvernement pendant une p&#233;riode de dix ans ou plus, ainsi que d'un
soutien du programme de r&#233;forme non d&#233;guis&#233; de la part du gouvernement.
<p>
Mais, et c'est la deuxi&#232;me condition, l'engagement politique doit &ecirc;tre renforc&#233; par
la mise en place d'un bureau de mise en oeuvre jouissant d'une influence et d'une autorit&#233;
suffisantes, ainsi que de la capacit&#233; intellectuelle et technique n&#233;cessaire pour formuler et
ex&#233;cuter le programme de r&#233;forme. Certains signes semblent indiquer que cet engagement
est en bonne voie. En Zambie, la responsabilit&#233; des r&#233;formes repose sur le secr&#233;taire
permanent de la division du d&#233;veloppement de la gestion du d&#233;partement minist&#233;riel.
Au Ghana et en Ouganda, le responsable de la r&#233;forme du service public est le chef du service
public. (Il est int&#233;ressant de noter qu'au Ghana, ce membre officiel a soit un rang
minist&#233;riel, soit un rang &#233;quivalent.) Une unit&#233; de coordination de la r&#233;forme et
un comit&#233; de r&#233;forme de l'administration ont &#233;t&#233; mis en place au Ghana
apr&#232;s qu'une &#233;tude men&#233;e en 1993 sur les exp&#233;riences de ce pays ait
r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; des faiblesses dans les domaines de la coordination et de l'&#233;valuation et
qu'elle ait permis de d&#233;tecter une transparence limit&#233;e de la culture de la r&#233;forme. 
<p>
Troisi&#232;mement, non seulement des objectifs clairement d&#233;finis sont n&#233;cessaires, mais
aussi des strat&#233;gies r&#233;alistes permettant de les r&#233;aliser: les moyens, la planification et
l'encha&icirc;nement des actions. Ce r&#233;alisme doit &ecirc;tre le reflet de l'environnement
politique et institutionnel d'un pays. En Zambie, par exemple, personne ne met en doute le besoin
d'un service public plus restreint et plus efficace qui r&#233;pondra aux besoins de gestion d'un
service gouvernemental moderne dans une p&#233;riode de changement politique majeur et de
difficult&#233; &#233;conomique grave. Mais en r&#233;alit&#233;, le service public, comme dans
beaucoup de pays africains, est une source consid&#233;rable d'emplois pour les jeunes
dipl&ocirc;m&#233;s. Par cons&#233;quent, il est difficile de juger jusqu'&#224; quel pont la
r&#233;duction du service public pourra &ecirc;tre tol&#233;r&#233;e par la soci&#233;t&#233; et le
syst&#232;me politique.
<p>
Ceci nous am&#232;ne au quatri&#232;me &#233;l&#233;ment du succ&#232;s, &#224; savoir une
communication efficace avec tous les acteurs et les parties prenantes ayant des int&#233;r&ecirc;ts
dans le processus de r&#233;forme du service public et avec tous les minist&#232;res et les agences
pouvant contribuer &#224; l'identification des probl&#232;mes, au d&#233;veloppement et &#224; la
mise en oeuvre des programmes de r&#233;forme. Mais l'exp&#233;rience montre que des discussions
aussi profondes sont souvent exp&#233;di&#233;es sans m&#233;nagement, en raison des contraintes
de temps lorsqu'il s'agit de montrer que "quelque chose a &#233;t&#233; fait" et &#233;galement en
raison de l'absence quasi totale de m&#233;thodes institutionnelles appropri&#233;es et d'individus
exp&#233;riment&#233;s pour faciliter de telles discussions. Ce dernier probl&#232;me est
habituellement aggrav&#233; par les activit&#233;s des bailleurs de fonds et des conseillers
ext&#233;rieurs qui, pour r&#233;pondre aux besoins et aux priorit&#233;s des programmes de
r&#233;forme dans lesquels ils sont impliqu&#233;s, tendent &#224; monopoliser le temps et les efforts
des individus exp&#233;riment&#233;s disponibles.
<p>
On aboutit ainsi &#224; la cinqui&#232;me et derni&#232;re condition du succ&#232;s, &#224; savoir
que, pour &ecirc;tre une r&#233;ussite, la r&#233;forme du service public doit "appartenir" aux
autorit&#233;s nationales. Des agences ext&#233;rieures, telles que la Banque mondiale ont un
r&ocirc;le &#224; jouer, mais un r&ocirc;le se limitant au soutien et &#224; la consultation, &#224;
l'instar des consultants sp&#233;cialis&#233;s auxquels les gouvernements des pays industrialis&#233;s
font appel pour d&#233;velopper leurs propres programmes de r&#233;forme. A maintes occasions,
les hauts fonctionnaires de la Banque mondiale ont nettement approuv&#233; l'importance de ce
r&ocirc;le secondaire des agences ext&#233;rieures et les implications qui l'accompagnent. Une de ces
implications est que la Banque mondiale ne doit pas remettre aux gouvernements un mod&#232;le
de mesures de r&#233;forme, mais bien reconna&icirc;tre l'importance cruciale de porter une
attention particuli&#232;re aux propositions du personnel local, administratif et politique, conscient
de ce qui peut &ecirc;tre mis en oeuvre ou non dans un pays. Cette approche exige cependant de
consacrer davantage de temps &#224; la phase de conception des programmes et &#224; leurs
strat&#233;gies de mise en oeuvre: une implication que les agences ext&#233;rieures, une fois encore,
ont non seulement accept&#233;e int&#233;gralement, mais affirment en plus &ecirc;tre essentielle
bien, que les m&#233;thodes pour la rendre fonctionnelle sont encore &#224; mettre en place. Une
autre implication concerne la politique traditionnelle de financement et de nomination des
expatri&#233;s de longue dur&#233;e pour concevoir et mettre en oeuvre des programmes de
r&#233;forme avec un homologue travaillant en parall&#232;le. Bien que la politique actuelle de
coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement cherche &#224; minimiser cette m&#233;thode, il est
probable que la pr&#233;sence d'experts sera n&#233;cessaire pendant un certain nombre
d'ann&#233;es. La strat&#233;gie utilis&#233;e doit garantir que ce sont bien les fonctionnaires locaux
qui sont charg&#233;s du programme, les agences ext&#233;rieures fournissant tout le support
technique suppl&#233;mentaire exig&#233;. 
<p>
<H3>Une approche globale</H3>
<p>
Ces cinq conditions pr&#233;liminaires pourraient ne pas suffire &#224; mener la r&#233;forme du
service public au succ&#232;s, mais certains signes semblent indiquer que leur pr&#233;sence en
augmente les chances. Elles devraient &ecirc;tre consid&#233;r&#233;es comme un ensemble au sein
duquel elles se renforceraient mutuellement. L'engagement politique n'est que tr&#232;s peu utile
si le gouvernement ne dispose pas des capacit&#233;s institutionnelles &#224; formuler et appliquer
un programme de r&#233;forme du service public. De mani&#232;re identique, il est important
d'admettre que les fonctionnaires ne sont pas les seuls &#224; &ecirc;tre impliqu&#233;s directement
dans cette capacit&#233;. Ces derniers doivent &#224; leur tour avoir la volont&#233; et la
capacit&#233; de faire appel aux connaissances et &#224; l'exp&#233;rience des autres minist&#232;res
et agences, aux individus et aux institutions des secteurs non gouvernementaux de la
soci&#233;t&#233;. Des mesures techniquement plus saines et politiquement plus r&#233;alisables en
seront la cons&#233;quence. 
<p>
La cinqui&#232;me condition concernant la propri&#233;t&#233; nationale sera d'autant plus facile
&#224; r&#233;aliser si les quatre premi&#232;res conditions pr&#233;alables sont satisfaites. Ces
conditions aboutiront en effet &#224; une relation plus &#233;quilibr&#233;e entre les responsables
du programme au sein de l'administration nationale et les agences ext&#233;rieures
fr&#233;quemment impliqu&#233;es. Les premiers sont plus susceptibles d'occuper une position forte
et d&#233;fendable, tandis que les derniers verront moins le besoin de jouer un r&ocirc;le trop
importun. Les agences ext&#233;rieures et les individus se soutenant mutuellement, on &#233;vitera
aux administrations africaines de devoir entrer en conflit lors de n&#233;gociations r&#233;alis&#233;es
avec des sources de financement ext&#233;rieures. Elles peuvent d&#233;tenir leurs programmes en
fait et en droit et acc&#233;der aux comp&#233;tences &#233;trang&#232;res lorsqu'elles le
demandent. Cependant, il est essentiel de ne pas sous-estimer le changement d'attitude et
d'approche que le processus cons&#233;cutif impliquera pour tous les acteurs engag&#233;s, qu'ils
soient issus des agences ext&#233;rieures ou des administrations nationales.

Ethique et responsabilit&#233; dans le service public africain

<p>
Les mesures pour renforcer l'&#233;tique et la responsabilit&#233; sont souvent un point essentiel
inscrit &#224; l'agenda de la r&#233;forme du service public dans les pays en voie de
d&#233;veloppement et les pays d&#233;velopp&#233;s. Ces derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, le d&#233;bat
sur les violations morales et les efforts pour les freiner et pour renforcer la responsabilit&#233; se sont
intensifi&#233;s en Afrique, principalement pour quatre raisons:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>l'augmentation de la fr&#233;quence des pratiques immorales et le manque de responsabilit&#233; ;
<LI>la vague de lib&#233;ralisation politique dans laquelle l'Afrique a plong&#233; depuis 1989 et qui a
donn&#233; &#224; une soci&#233;t&#233; en herbe le courage de demander l'application de codes
de moralit&#233; et la condamnation de ceux qui les violent;
<LI>une reconnaissance progressive de la contribution des pratiques immorales aux difficult&#233;s
financi&#232;res auxquelles de nombreux pays africains doivent faire face; et
<LI>la pression exerc&#233;e par les bailleurs de fonds ext&#233;rieurs qui exigent que les pays africains
s'attachent plus scrupuleusement &#224; assurer une bonne gouvernance et &#224; r&#233;duire le
gaspillage et la dissipation des ressources.
</UL> 
<p>
Le manque de responsabilit&#233;, le comportement immoral et les pratiques de corruption se sont
tellement r&#233;pandus, devenant m&ecirc;me des normes institutionnelles de comportement en
Afrique, que l'on peut parler &#224; juste titre d'une crise de moralit&#233; dans les services publics
africains. Alors que certains pays, comme la Namibie ou le Botswana, se distinguent par des niveaux
"acceptables" de corruption, la r&#233;alit&#233; est malheureusement diff&#233;rente dans la
majorit&#233; des pays africains. En dehors de la corruption inconditionnelle, le patronage, le
n&#233;potisme, le d&#233;tournement de fonds, le trafic d'influence, l'utilisation de sa position pour
son enrichissement personnel, le favoritisme de parents ou d'amis, le travail au noir, la partialit&#233;,
l'absent&#233;isme, les arriv&#233;es tardives au travail, l'abus des biens publics, la fuite et/ou l'abus
d'informations gouvernementales sont des manifestations courantes de cette situation critique. 
L'impact n&#233;gatif &#233;vident de telles pratiques sur la productivit&#233;, la r&#233;activit&#233;,
la l&#233;gitimit&#233; et la transparence des gouvernements, la mise en oeuvre effective des
politiques, et les efforts pour engendrer le redressement et le d&#233;veloppement dictent en
g&#233;n&#233;ral le besoin d'engager des actions concert&#233;es entres toutes les personnes
concern&#233;es pour traiter ce probl&#232;me d&#233;bilitant. 
<p>
Traiter avec succ&#232;s ce ph&#233;nom&#232;ne n&#233;cessite une compr&#233;hension plus
profonde des causes sous-jacentes. Les divers auteurs qui ont tent&#233; de donner une explication
plausible du probl&#232;me ont souvent distingu&#233; l'une ou l'autre dimension comme facteur le
plus crucial. Certains affirment cependant que la question n'est pas si simple et que des facteurs
politiques, culturels et &#233;conomiques sont &#224; la racine du probl&#232;me multidimensionnel. 
<p>
Au fil des ann&#233;es, l'Etat africain s'est transform&#233; peu &#224; peu en entit&#233; non
d&#233;mocratique, autocratique, et patrimoniale. Etant essentiellement un v&#233;hicule
ex&#233;cutant la volont&#233; et les caprices non remis en question d'une &#233;lite dirigeante
irresponsable, l'Etat est devenu un terrain id&#233;al de reproduction des forces extr&ecirc;mes
engendrant un comportement immoral. M&ecirc;me avec la transition vers une lib&#233;ralisation
politique plus importante, le paternalisme est une qualit&#233; dont l'Etat doit effectivement se
d&#233;barrasser.
<p>
Parce que le recrutement dans le service public a &#233;t&#233; et est toujours tr&#232;s
influenc&#233; par le patronage et les facteurs politiques, les loyaut&#233;s, les engagements et les
actions des fonctionnaires publics sont souvent guid&#233;s et fa&#231;onn&#233;s par leurs
loyaut&#233;s primordiales plut&ocirc;t que par les exigences d'un professionnalisme impartial. 
<p>
La nature omnipr&#233;sente de l'Etat, son contr&ocirc;le surd&#233;velopp&#233; des affaires
&#233;conomiques, les pouvoirs de licenciement et d'approbation dont sont investis les fonctionnaires
publics ont cr&#233;&#233; de grandes opportunit&#233;s d'abus professionnel &#224; des fins
d'enrichissement personnel.
<p>
La question quant &#224; savoir si la crise &#233;conomique est une cause ou un effet de la crise
&#233;thique en Afrique est toujours tr&#232;s discut&#233;e. Certains sont n&#233;anmoins d'avis que,
alors que les deux crises se renforcent sans aucun doute mutuellement, la d&#233;t&#233;rioration
rapide des conditions &#233;conomiques - que conna&icirc;t la majorit&#233; des pays africains depuis
le d&#233;but des ann&#233;es 80 - a encourag&#233; davantage les titulaires des bureaux publics, tant
politiciens qu'administrateurs, &#224; chercher et &#224; obtenir des compensations en &#233;change
de leurs services et qu'elle a affaibli leur aversion et leur horreur de telles pratiques. 
<p>
<H3>Peut-on rem&#233;dier &#224; la situation?</H3>
<p>
Plusieurs tentatives ont &#233;t&#233; entreprises au cours des ann&#233;es pour combattre les
pratiques de corruption et de violations &#233;thiques. La promulgation de r&#232;gles et la mise en
place de m&#233;canismes institutionnels pour renforcer le comportement moral sont communs
&#224; toutes ces tentatives. 
<p>
En 1975, le Nig&#233;ria a promulgu&#233; un Code de conduite qui a &#233;t&#233; int&#233;gr&#233;
par la suite dans les constitutions de 1979 et de 1989, exigeant des hauts fonctionnaires de ne pas
autoriser leurs int&#233;r&ecirc;ts personnels &#224; entrer en conflit avec leurs responsabilit&#233;s
officielles, de ne pas s'impliquer dans des engagements p&#233;cuniaires secondaires, de ne pas
exploiter des comptes dans des banques &#233;trang&#232;res, de ne pas demander de cadeaux, de
d&#233;clarer leurs biens lors de leur entr&#233;e en fonction, tous les quatre ans et &#224; la fin de
leur contrat. En 1957, l'Ethiopie a promulgu&#233; un article sp&#233;cial dans le code p&#233;nal civil
qui, sous le titre "Rupture de la confiance et d&#233;lits contre les int&#233;r&ecirc;ts du
gouvernement et du service public," couvrait des clauses g&#233;rant notamment la perception de
gains mal acquis, l'abus ou le gaspillage de biens publics, la fraude de documents publics, les pratiques
de corruption, et l'acceptation d'avantages non dus. La C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire a promulgu&#233; une loi
contre la corruption et un "Certificat de lutte contre la corruption" en 1977.
<p>
Divers organismes ont aussi &#233;t&#233; mis en place pour freiner les violations &#233;thiques. Le
syst&#232;me de m&#233;diation charg&#233; d'arbitrer les litiges entre les citoyens et l'administration
a &#233;t&#233; mis &#224; l'&#233;preuve au Ghana, au Nig&#233;ria, en Namibie, au Soudan, en
Zambie, en Tanzanie et au Zimbabwe. Le Nig&#233;ria a instaur&#233; un comit&#233; de
r&#233;clamations publiques en 1975 pour enqu&ecirc;ter sur les plaintes relatives &#224; des actes
administratifs commis par des hauts fonctionnaires, ainsi qu'un comit&#233; des comptes publics en
1966 pour assister les l&#233;gislateurs dans leurs fonctions de surveillance des bureaux ex&#233;cutifs
quant &#224; la d&#233;pense des fonds publics. Des organismes identiques ont &#233;t&#233; mis en
place dans d'autres pays, comme par exemple le comit&#233; de contr&ocirc;le des travailleurs (1987)
et la "Cour sp&#233;ciale" pour juger les d&#233;lits relatifs &#224; l'exploitation, au gaspillage et &#224;
l'abus de l'autorit&#233;, &#224; la pratique de corruption et au favoritisme (1981) en Ethiopie; le
Groupe anti-corruption (1975), la Commission de renforcement du code de direction (1973) et la
Commission permanente d'enqu&ecirc;te (1966) en Tanzanie.
<p>
Dans certains cas, ces initiatives ont en partie r&#233;ussi &#224; r&#233;aliser certains des objectifs
directs cach&#233;s derri&#232;re ces mesures. Cela n'a cependant pas &#233;t&#233;
g&#233;n&#233;ralement le cas. Plus important est le fait que la fr&#233;quence de violation
&#233;thique s'est accrue, m&ecirc;me dans des pays o&ugrave; un grand nombre de contrevenants
ont &#233;t&#233; soumis &#224; une enqu&ecirc;te et/ou condamn&#233;s.
<p>
Reste la question cruciale: pourquoi ces mesures ont-elles &#233;t&#233; en g&#233;n&#233;ral un
&#233;chec? Est-il r&#233;aliste d'esp&#233;rer rem&#233;dier &#224; cette situation &#233;tant
donn&#233; l'&#233;tendue du malaise de conduite immorale et, jusqu'ici, le succ&#232;s limit&#233;
de son traitement?
<p>
En premier lieu, ces mesures &#233;taient un &#233;chec car elles ont &#233;t&#233; introduites dans
un environnement politique et politicien qui contribuait insuffisamment au succ&#232;s de ces
mesures. Lorsque la grande corruption s&#233;vit au niveau sup&#233;rieur du gouvernement et des
politiques, la nature de la gouvernance reste fondamentalement non d&#233;mocratique,
irresponsable et patrimoniale. L&#224; o&ugrave; les syst&#232;mes de patronage sont rest&#233;s
intacts, on peut &#224; peine esp&#233;rer mettre en vigueur des mesures contre le comportement
immoral avec un quelconque degr&#233; de s&#233;rieux ou esp&#233;rer que les syst&#232;mes et
les institutions visant &#224; renforcer l'&#233;thique fonctionneront sans ing&#233;rence. Donc, la
nature de l'Etat, de la gouvernance et de l'engagement au plus haut niveau politique sont des
conditions n&#233;cessaires pour arriver &#224; freiner et &#224; condamner avec succ&#232;s les
violations &#233;thiques.
<p>
Deuxi&#232;mement, les mesures introduites ont &#233;t&#233; essentiellement de nature partielle,
se focalisant surtout sur les sanctions.
<p>
Troisi&#232;mement, de nombreuses institutions mises en place pour encourager la moralit&#233; et
la responsabilit&#233; ont souvent manqu&#233; de ressources, de visibilit&#233; publique,
d'impartialit&#233; et de soutien public n&#233;cessaires &#224; leur succ&#232;s. 
<p>
L'ampleur du travail pour traiter les pratiques de corruption et pour encourager la moralit&#233; et
la responsabilit&#233; dans le service public africain ne doit pas &ecirc;tre sous-estim&#233;e.
Malgr&#233; des exp&#233;riences d&#233;sastreuses dans ce domaine, il est toujours possible d'en
tirer de grands b&#233;n&#233;fices. A cet effet, il est n&#233;cessaire que le gouvernement et le
public appliquent de mani&#232;re consciencieuse et soutenue des mesures globales se
renfor&#231;ant r&#233;ciproquement - pas simplement des solutions partielles - pour faire face
&#224; la nature multidimensionnelle du probl&#232;me, dans le cadre d'une gouvernance
d&#233;mocratique, r&#233;active, transparente et responsable.
<p>
Un agenda d&#233;taill&#233; pour encourager l'&#233;thique et la responsabilit&#233; dans les
services publics de l'Afrique contemporaine devrait englober les points suivants:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Stimuler et encourager des mesures aptes &#224; renforcer les normes professionnelles et morales.
<LI>Mettre en avant et affirmer des politiques saines sur le recrutement, la formation et la gestion du
personnel du service public.
<LI>Encourager les associations du service public &#224; jouer un r&ocirc;le catalytique dans
l'institutionnalisation des valeurs professionnelles et dans la d&#233;fense des int&#233;r&ecirc;ts ayant
rapport avec la profession.
<LI>Cr&#233;er une psychologie du service dans la vie publique et politique.
<LI>Cr&#233;er, renforcer et soutenir l'int&#233;grit&#233; et l'efficacit&#233; des institutions publiques
en mati&#232;re de responsabilit&#233;.
<LI>R&#233;duire une centralisation et une bureaucratie excessives.
<LI>Mettre en vigueur, am&#233;liorer et renforcer effectivement des outils l&#233;gaux, des codes de
conduite et des arr&ecirc;t&#233;s qui encouragent l'&#233;thique et la responsabilit&#233;.
<LI>Etablir des coalitions d'associations professionnelles et de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile pour
d&#233;voiler et combattre la corruption.
<LI>Informer par des campagnes de masses de l'&#233;tendue et du co&ucirc;t de la corruption et du
comportement immoral.
<LI>Poursuivre en justice, de mani&#232;re syst&#233;matique et impartiale, les contrevenants.
<LI>Stimuler la participation de la population pour garantir la r&#233;activit&#233;, la responsabilit&#233;
et la transparence de la gouvernance.
</UL>
<p>
Ce dernier point de l'agenda d&#233;taill&#233; demande une discussion plus approfondie. M&ecirc;me
les meilleures garanties et les meilleures pratiques sous les syst&#232;mes de gouvernance
d&#233;mocratique peuvent c&#233;der aux abus, comme l'a d&#233;montr&#233; &#224; plusieurs
reprises l'exp&#233;rience des pays d&#233;velopp&#233;s. C'est pour cette raison qu'une garantie
consid&#233;rable de normes sup&#233;rieures de moralit&#233; et de responsabilit&#233; doit relever
de la capacit&#233; des citoyens, des organisations et des associations populaires &#224; tenir les
fonctionnaires publics et les politiciens responsables de leurs actes et &#233;galement s'assurer que
les institutions publiques remplissent leurs fonctions de mani&#232;re correcte et responsable. En
Afrique, le processus de r&#233;forme politique en cours devrait renforcer de telles
opportunit&#233;s. 
<p>
Enfin, il ne faut pas n&#233;gliger la dimension internationale de la crise &#233;thique. La corruption
des hauts fonctionnaires publics dans les pays en voie de d&#233;veloppement a souvent
&#233;t&#233; employ&#233;e par les hommes d'affaires des pays d&#233;velopp&#233;s comme une
m&#233;thode juste et l&#233;gitime pour favoriser
l'exportation. Dans les pays industrialis&#233;s de nombreux gouvernements passent la corruption
sous silence, certains l'encouragent ouvertement et d'autres accordent m&ecirc;me des
r&#233;ductions d'imp&ocirc;t sur les pots-de-vin. Il est urgent de renforcer le comportement
&#233;thique au niveau international enfin de pouvoir r&#233;duire la grande corruption dans les pays
en voie de d&#233;veloppement - dont l'Afrique - r&#233;sultant des transactions d'activit&#233;s
internationales. Ces derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, Transparency International a jou&#233; un r&ocirc;le
appr&#233;ciable en tirant la sonnette d'alarme sur ce probl&#232;me et en demandant la prise
d'actions pour y rem&#233;dier. N'importe quel progr&#232;s significatif dans ce sens demanderait
un accord sur des conventions internationales et leur mise en vigueur stricte visant &#224; condamner
les corrompus, renforcer des syst&#232;mes internationaux d'int&#233;grit&#233;, instaurer des lois
de divulgation des comptes ext&#233;rieurs, le rapatriement des biens et des paiements acquis par
voie de corruption internationale. La communaut&#233; internationale est cependant loin de tout
consensus susceptible d'aborder de telles mesures.

Contribution de l'AAPAM &#224; la r&#233;forme du service public
</h3>
par<i> Ali D. Yahaya</i>
<p>
Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans le <i>Bulletin DPMN</i>, 3(1), ao&#251;t 1995:
pages 15 - 16
</center>
<hr>
<p>
Depuis sa mise en place en 1962, l'AAPAM a concentr&#233; son attention sur l'am&#233;lioration des
performances du service public africain comme &#233;l&#233;ment essentiel pour faire avancer le
d&#233;veloppement institutionnel et le renforcement des capacit&#233;s dans ces pays. Les
r&#233;formes entreprises dans plusieurs services publics dans les ann&#233;es 60 et 70 traduisent ces
efforts. 
<p>
La philosophie et le raisonnement li&#233;s &#224; ces r&#233;formes s'exprimaient par un
mod&#232;le de r&#233;forme se focalisant exclusivement sur le service public au d&#233;triment des
autres sous-syst&#232;mes qui influent sur le service public. Cette focalisation r&#233;duite &#233;tait
le reflet de l'id&#233;ologie politique d&#233;velopp&#233;e et de la strat&#233;gie &#233;conomique
qui donnaient &#224; l'Etat un r&ocirc;le dominant dans la soci&#233;t&#233; et l'&#233;conomie. Mais
cette strat&#233;gie et cette id&#233;ologie n'ont pas emp&ecirc;ch&#233; la crise &#233;conomique
qui a submerg&#233; l'Afrique pendant les ann&#233;es 80 -- elle a peut- &ecirc;tre m&ecirc;me
contribu&#233; &#224; la gravit&#233; de la crise.
<p>
<H3>R&#233;formes dans le cadre des programmes d'ajustement structurel</H3>
<p>
L'introduction de programmes d'ajustement structurel a &#233;t&#233; l'aboutissement de cette crise
dans de nombreux pays africains. Ces programmes englobaient de mani&#232;re typique des mesures
visant &#224; encourager la r&#233;forme du service public. N&#233;anmoins, ces mesures avaient
fondamentalement le m&ecirc;me centre d'int&#233;r&ecirc;t que celles des programmes de
r&#233;forme des ann&#233;es 60 et 70, avec un souci exclusif &#224; l'&#233;gard du service public
et l'ignorance des sous-syst&#232;mes. La diff&#233;rence majeure avec la pass&#233; repose sur
l'accentuation de deux &#233;l&#233;ments qui se compl&#232;tent r&#233;ciproquement:
l'efficacit&#233; du service public et l'endiguement du co&ucirc;t.
<p>
Le premier point consiste &#224; chercher &#224; am&#233;liorer l'efficacit&#233; du service public
par la r&#233;organisation et la restructuration du gouvernement, pour qu'il puisse jouer un r&ocirc;le
plus fonctionnel et plus catalytique et non seulement un r&ocirc;le de fournisseur de services. Ainsi,
ce point se concentre en premier lieu sur la garantie d'une d&#233;finition plus claire des fonctions
minist&#233;rielles et de celles des bureaux, notamment l'abolition ou la privatisation de ces fonctions.
Ce point s'adresse ensuite aux questions d'ordre humain des proc&#233;dures de licenciement, des
m&#233;thodes selon lesquelles le salaire augmente en fonction des r&#233;sultats et en
g&#233;n&#233;ral aux fa&#231;ons de renforcer les syst&#232;mes gouvernementaux &#224; travers,
par exemple, des proc&#233;dures financi&#232;res r&#233;vis&#233;es, des nouvelles technologies,
et une nouvelle philosophie du service pour la population. Ce point se concentre en m&ecirc;me
temps et consid&#233;rablement sur des mesures qui visent &#224; am&#233;liorer la capacit&#233;
du service public &#224; entreprendre un travail d'analyse des politiques, notamment le
d&#233;veloppement d'une philosophie de planification strat&#233;gique.
<p>
Le deuxi&#232;me point, li&#233; au premier, est la focalisation sur l'endiguement du co&ucirc;t. Ce
deuxi&#232;me point implique normalement &#224; la fois la r&#233;duction du service public et les
probl&#232;mes li&#233;s au licenciement, au salaire relatif, &#224; la promotion et autres primes
davantage li&#233;es aux r&#233;sultats.
<p>
<H3>Un contexte plus &#233;tendu pour la r&#233;forme du service public</H3>
<p>
Malgr&#233; ces initiatives de r&#233;forme d'une port&#233;e consid&#233;rable dans le cadre des
programmes d'ajustement structurel, le raisonnement de la r&#233;forme s'inscrit toujours dans la
perspective premi&#232;re plus &#233;troite, &#224; savoir l'administration et la gestion publiques
dans le contexte de la conception de Max Weber de bureaucratie rationnelle et d'un engagement
pour copier cette forme de bureaucratie en Afrique. Des questions plus d&#233;velopp&#233;es
relatives aux valeurs du syst&#232;me politique, au r&#233;seau des partenaires sociaux engag&#233;s
dans un processus d'interaction aux fins de gouvernance, au d&#233;veloppement et au renforcement
du secteur priv&#233; et de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile en g&#233;n&#233;ral, apparaissent &#224; peine
&#224; l'ordre du jour de ces r&#233;formes. 
<p>
C'est la reconnaissance de cette vision limit&#233;e essentielle dans les efforts pr&#233;c&#233;dents
en faveur de la r&#233;forme du service public qui a incit&#233; le secr&#233;tariat du Commonwealth,
la CEA et l'AAPAM &#224; sponsoriser l'instauration de centres d'analyse politique et de formation
&#224; la gestion en Afrique. La cr&#233;ation de ces groupes a pour objectif de rassembler les
individus issus &#224; la fois du secteur public et de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile. Ces groupes doivent
d'abord &ecirc;tre mis en place &#224; Abuja au Nig&#233;ria, &#224; Dakar au S&#233;n&#233;gal,
&#224; Nairobi au Kenya, &#224; Dar es Salaam en Tanzanie, &#224; Maputo en Mozambique et &#224;
Garborone au Botswana. La condition pr&#233;alable et fondamentale pour que ces centres soient
cr&#233;&#233;s est qu'ils "appartiennent" au gouvernement.
<p>
<H3>Programme des nouveaux centres de formation</H3>
<p>
Le renforcement des capacit&#233;s de gouvernance correcte est la pr&#233;occupation principale
de ces nouveaux centres. Parmi les questions que ces centres devront aborder, citons le processus et
les relations en particulier entre le secteur public et la soci&#233;t&#233; civile. Des s&#233;minaires
politiques de haut niveau seront organis&#233;s pour r&#233;unir les politiciens, les directeurs, les
administrateurs et les universitaires dans le but de discuter des questions politiques qui
&#233;mergent &#224; la fois des niveaux d&#233;partemental et macro et des niveaux sectoriels et
micro. Les probl&#232;mes de d&#233;centralisation, de mandats, de la gestion des ressources
environnementales et naturelles, ainsi que les relations entre les politiques et les parties prenantes
seront trait&#233;s.
<p>
Une formation appropri&#233;e destin&#233;e aux directeurs sera &#233;galement &#233;labor&#233;e.
Ceci demandera en particulier une collaboration plus rapproch&#233;e des instituts d'administration
et de gestion bas&#233;s dans les universit&#233;s. L'AAPAM, ainsi que les autres institutions de
financement participeront au conseil commun d'&#233;tudes des universit&#233;s pour garantir que
tous les points de vue des nouveaux centres seront pris en consid&#233;ration dans la
d&#233;termination de la structure et du contenu des cours. L'&#233;change de membres des
facult&#233;s et l'organisation d'activit&#233;s communes sont envisag&#233;s. On esp&#232;re ainsi
&#233;viter la redondance des programmes, tout en maintenant un service de qualit&#233;
sup&#233;rieure.
<p>
Enfin, bien que la proposition d'instaurer ces centres se concentre principalement sur le secteur
public, il faut rappeler que l'objectif principal est de forger un partenariat entre les acteurs politiques
du syst&#232;me politique, de d&#233;velopper des centres rapprochant l'Etat et la soci&#233;t&#233;
civile et donc d'encourager des liens requis pour bien gouverner.

Le Conseil D&eacute;veloppement, r&eacute;uni ce mardi &agrave;
Bruxelles sous la Pr&eacute;sidence de M. Rino Serri, secr&eacute;taire
d'Etat italien aux Affaires &eacute;trang&egrave;res, a
progress&eacute; sans encombres sur les quatre textes visant &agrave;
fournir une base juridique &agrave; des domaines d'intervention
importants de la politique de coop&eacute;ration de l'Union avec
le tiers monde.
<P>
Le Conseil a, en effet, adopt&eacute; formellement, en deuxi&egrave;me
lecture, le r&egrave;glement sur l'aide humanitaire et approuv&eacute;
en 1&egrave;re lecture ses &quot;positions communes&quot; sur
les 3 r&egrave;glements &quot;r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s des PVD d'Am&eacute;rique
latine et d'Asie&quot; (PVDALA), &quot;lutte contre le sida&quot;
et &quot;environnement et d&eacute;veloppement durable&quot;.
Pour ces trois dossiers, la d&eacute;l&eacute;gation britannique
n'a pas fait jouer sa r&eacute;serve de principe, arguant du fait
que la majorit&eacute; qualifi&eacute;e s'appliquait (en r&eacute;alit&eacute;,
l'unanimit&eacute; &eacute;tait requise, le Conseil ayant modifi&eacute;
la proposition de la Commission sur la question controvers&eacute;e
de la comitologie, sans l'accord de celle-ci).
<P>
Le Conseil a d&eacute;battu avec des r&eacute;sultats positifs
de tous les autres sujets inscrits &agrave; son ordre du jour,
mais n'a pas pu proc&eacute;der &agrave; l'adoption formelle des
r&eacute;solutions ou conclusions pr&eacute;vues, en raison de
l'opposition des Britanniques. L'adoption formelle aura lieu sans
d&eacute;bat lors d'un prochain Conseil, d&egrave;s que le Royaume-Uni
le rendra possible.
<P>
<U><B>Compte-rendu d&eacute;taill&eacute; des r&eacute;sultats
du Conseil.</B></U>
<P>
A la lumi&egrave;re de l'attitude de principe du Royaume-Uni sur
les diff&eacute;rents points &agrave; l'ordre du jour, le Conseil
&quot;coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement&quot; a abouti
aux r&eacute;sultats suivants sur les diff&eacute;rents points
inscrits &agrave; son ordre du jour:
<P>
<B>1.</B> <B>Aide humanitaire</B>: le Conseil a approuv&eacute;
en principe le r&egrave;glement qui fournira une base juridique
aux activit&eacute;s d'Echo (Office humanitaire de la Communaut&eacute;)
qui se sont &eacute;norm&eacute;ment d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es
(environ 750 M&eacute;cus en 1995). Ce r&egrave;glement assigne
des objectifs clairs et des crit&egrave;res g&eacute;n&eacute;raux
&agrave; l'aide humanitaire en d&eacute;finissant les types d'interventions
et les liens entre l'aide humanitaire et la pr&eacute;paration
aux catastrophes, la r&eacute;habilitation et la reconstruction.
Il fixe &eacute;galement les proc&eacute;dures de mise en oeuvre
des actions humanitaires men&eacute;es en coop&eacute;ration avec
les ONG, et des programmes d'aide financ&eacute;s par la Communaut&eacute;.
L'adoption formelle du r&egrave;glement interviendra apr&egrave;s
mise au point du texte.
<P>
<B>2.</B> <B>Aide aux r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s PVDALA, lutte contre
le sida dans les PVD, protection de l'environnement dans le contexte
du d&eacute;veloppement durable</B>: le Conseil a approuv&eacute;
ses &quot;positions communes&quot; sur chacun de ces trois r&egrave;glements.
L'accord politique sur la question la plus d&eacute;licate de
la comitologie (qui d&eacute;termine le degr&eacute; d'autonomie
d&eacute;cisionnelle de la Commission) a &eacute;t&eacute; atteint
sur la base d'un compromis de la Pr&eacute;sidence, que la Commission
n'accepte pas.
<P>
<B>3. Liens entre l'aide d'urgence, l'aide &agrave; la r&eacute;habilitation
et le d&eacute;veloppement &agrave; lONG terme</B>: le Conseil
a proc&eacute;d&eacute; &agrave; un d&eacute;bat approfondi et
un large consensus s'est d&eacute;gag&eacute; sur la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;
d'un continuum entre ces trois aspects de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement,
ce qui suppose notamment que les ONG soient impliqu&eacute;es
dans les actions de d&eacute;veloppement, au-del&agrave; de l'urgence.
Les conclusions n'ont pu &ecirc;tre adopt&eacute;es, pour les
raisons indiqu&eacute;es.
<P>
Voici la teneur de ce projet de conclusions, que le Conseil a
ins&eacute;r&eacute; dans le communiqu&eacute; de presse m&ecirc;me
si elles ne sont pas formellement adopt&eacute;es:
<P>
a) l'UE souscrit &agrave; l'id&eacute;e que le renforcement des
liens entre l'aide d'urgence, la r&eacute;habilitation et le d&eacute;veloppement
doit s'op&eacute;rer progressivement selon le sch&eacute;ma propos&eacute;
par la Commission
<P>
b) la Commission &eacute;laborera avec les Etats membres int&eacute;ress&eacute;s
des cadres de politique globale pour un certain nombre de pays
ou r&eacute;gions - notamment ceux qui peuvent &ecirc;tre expos&eacute;s
&agrave; des risques politiques ou &eacute;conomiques et &agrave;
des tensions ou des catastrophes naturelles, et elle d&eacute;finira
plus clairement les moyens coiicrets de renforcer les liens entre
l'aide d'urgence, la r&eacute;habilitation et le d&eacute;veloppement
<P>
c) &agrave; la lumi&egrave;re de la premi&egrave;re exp&eacute;rience
acquise en la mati&egrave;re, le Conseil D&eacute;veloppement
proc&eacute;dera &agrave; un nouvel &eacute;change de vues lors
de sa prochaine session (novembre 1996) qui d&eacute;bouchera
sur l' adoption d' une r&eacute;solution et l'&eacute;tablissement
de principes
<P>
La Commission a recens&eacute; 12 pays ou r&eacute;gions qui pourraient
faire l'objet de ce premier exercice: Angola, Liberia, Ha&iuml;ti,
Somalie, Pays des Grands Lacs, Guatemala, Salvador, Cambodge,
Afghanistan, G&eacute;orgie, Arm&eacute;nie, Azerba&iuml;djan.
<P>
<B>4. Evaluation de l'impact environnemental des projets et programmes
de d&eacute;veloppement</B>: le Conseil a eu une discussion politique
sur ce sujet mais n'a pas adopt&eacute; de r&eacute;solution.
Les ministres ont soulign&eacute; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de
prendre en compte le facteur environnement dans toute d&eacute;cision
ou mise en oeuvre des politiques, programmes ou projet de d&eacute;veloppement
et de recourir plus syst&eacute;matiquement &agrave; l'&eacute;valuation
d'impact environnemental avant l'approbation formelle des projets.
<P>
<B>5. Suite de la r&eacute;solution Horizon 2000</B>: dans le
cadre du suivi de la d&eacute;claration &quot;coop&eacute;ration
au d&eacute;veloppement &agrave; l'Horizon 2000&quot;, le Conseil
a d&eacute;battu: a) de la coordination op&eacute;rationnelle
&agrave; la lumi&egrave;re de l'exp&eacute;rience men&eacute;e
sur le terrain, sans adopter de conclusions toujours &agrave;
cause de la r&eacute;serve britannique; b) de la coh&eacute;rence
entre la politique de d&eacute;veloppement et des autres politiques
de la Communaut&eacute;, &agrave; la demande de la d&eacute;l&eacute;gation
danoise.
<P>
<B>6. Coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e</B>: le Conseil
a eu une discussion et approuvera d&egrave;s que possible des
conclusions.
<P>
<B>7. Migrations et d&eacute;veloppement</B>: le Conseil a d&eacute;battu
des liens entre certaines formes de l'assistance aux pays pauvres
et l'augmentation des flux migratoires. Les conclusions n'ont
pu &ecirc;tre adopt&eacute;es.
<P>
<B>8. Pr&eacute;vention des conflits en Afrique</B>: sur la base
de la communication de la Commission, pr&eacute;sent&eacute;e
aux ministres par le Commissaire Pinheiro, le Conseil s'est montr&eacute;
tr&egrave;s largement favorable &agrave; l'approche de la Commission
pr&ocirc;nant une approche globale et volontariste qui int&egrave;gre
la pr&eacute;vention pr&eacute;coce des conflits violents dans
la politique de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement de
l'UE.

EU Council of Development Ministers<br>

The Development Council convening in Brussels this Tuesday under
the Presidency of Mr Rino Serri, Italian Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs, made smooth progress on the four texts aimed
at providing a legal base for important areas of intervention
of EU cooperation policy with the Third World. The Council formally
adopted at second reading the regulation on humanitarian aid and
approved at first reading its &quot;common positions&quot; on
the 3 regulations from Latin American and Asian LDCs&quot;, &quot;fight
against aids&quot; and &quot;environment and sustainable development&quot;.
For these three items, the UK delegation did not bring into play
its reserve in principle, arguing that the qualified majority
applied (in reality, unanimity was required, the Council having
amended the Commission proposal on the controversial item of comitology,
without its agreement).
<P>
The Council debated with positive results all the other items
on its agenda but was unable to formally adopt the resolutions
or conclusions anticipated because of the opposition from the
UK. Formal adoption will take place without debate at a forthcoming
Council as soon as the United Kingdom makes it possible.
<P>
<h3>Detailed minutes of the results of the Council:</h3>
<P>
In the light of the attitude of principle shown by the United
Kingdom on the various points on the agenda, the Council for Development
Cooperation reached the conclusions outlined below on the different
points on the agenda.
<P>
<B>1. Humanitarian aid.</B> The Council approved, in principle,
the regulation that will provide a legal base for the activities
of ECHO (Community Humanitarian Aid Office) which have developed
to a very large extent (about MECU 750 in 1995). This regulation
assigns clear objectives and general criteria for humanitarian
aid by defining the types of intervention and the links between
humanitarian aid and the preparation for disasters, rehabilitation
and reconstruction. It also sets the procedures for implementation
of humanitarian actions conducted in cooperation with NGOs and
aid programmes financed by the Community. The formal adoption
of the regulation will come about once the text bas been finalised.
<P>
<B>2. Aid to LDCALA refugees, the fight against AIDS in LDC, environmental
protection in the context of sustainable development</B>: the
Council approved its common positions on each of these three regulations.
The political agreement on the tricky question of comitology (which
determines the degree of decision-making autonomy on the part
of the Commission) was reached on the basis of a Presidency compromise,
that the Commission does not accept.
<P>
<B>3. Links between emergency aid, aid to rehabilitation and long-term
development</B>: the Council held an in-depth debate and a broad
consensus was reached on the need for a link between these three
aspects of development aid which presupposes, above all, that
NGOs be involved in development action, even beyond emergency
situations. Conclusions were not adopted for the reasons indicated.
<P>
We give below the content of the draft conclusions, given in the
press release by the Council although they are not officially
adopted:
<P>
a) the EU subscribes to the idea that the strengthening of links
between emergency aid, rehabilitation and development must take
place gradually according to the system proposed by the Commission;
<P>
b) the Commission will elaborate, with Members States concerned,
frameworks for global policy for a certain number of countries
or regions - mainly those that may be exposed to political or
economic risks and to tensions or natural disasters, and will
define more clearly the concrete means for strengthening links
between emergency aid, rehabilitation and development.
<P>
c) In the light of the first experience gained in the matter,
the Development Council will proceed to a new exchange of views
during its next sitting (November 1996) which will result in the
adoption of a resolution and the establishment of detailed guidelines.
<P>
The Commission has listed 12 countries that may be covered by
the first exercise: Angola, Liberia, Haiti, Somalia, Great Lake
Countries, Guatemala, Salvador, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Georgia,
Armenia, Azerbaijan.
<P>
<B>4. Environmental impact assessment of development projects
and programmes</B>: the Council held a political discussion on
this subject but did not adopt a resolution. The ministers stressed
the need to take into account the environment factor in every
decision or implementation of policies, programmes or development
projects and to have more systematic recourse to assessment of
environmental impact before giving formal approval of projects.
<P>
<B>5. Follow-up to Horizon 2000 resolution</B>: in the context
of follow-up to the declaration &quot;development cooperation
on Horizon 2000&quot;, the Council discussed: a) operation coordination
in the light of experience gained on the ground, without adopting
conclusions, still because of British reservation; b) coherence
between development policy and the other Community policies at
the request of the Danish delegation.
<P>
<B>6. Decentralised cooperation</B>: the Council held a discussion
and will approve conclusions as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>7. Migration and development</B>: the Council discussed the
links between certain forms of assistance to poor countries and
the increase in migratory flows, Conclusions were not adopted.
<P>
<B>8. Conflict prevention in Africa</B>: on the basis of the Commission
communication, presented to the ministers by Commissioner Pinheiro,
the Council showed itself to be largely in favour of the Commission's
approach that recommends an overall and voluntarist one which
that integrates early prevention of violent conflicts in the EU's
policy for development cooperation.

Le groupe a pass&eacute; en revue les 4 s&eacute;ries de questions
inscrites &agrave; l'ordre du jour. Le d&eacute;bat a couvert
l'ensemble des questions pr&eacute;vues &agrave; l'ordre du jour,
bien que les conclusions tir&eacute;es ne cadraient pas n&eacute;cessairement
tr&egrave;s bien avec la rubrique de chaque sujet et qu'en outre,
elles ne sont pas pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es sous les m&ecirc;mes
intitul&eacute;s dans cette synth&egrave;se. Bien des points ont
fait l'objet d'un consensus m&ecirc;me si, naturellement, la discussion
avait tendance &agrave; se concentrer sur les sujets de d&eacute;saccord.
<P>
<H3><B>Les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences sont-elles efficaces?</B></H3>
<P>
Une discussion approfondie a port&eacute; sur l'efficacit&eacute;,
ou l'inefficacit&eacute;, des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences et de
nombreux exemples pratiques ont &eacute;t&eacute; cit&eacute;s
pour illustrer leurs effets positifs et leurs limites. Bien que
l'on n'ait pas obtenu une unit&eacute; de vues sur le sujet, un
large consensus a &eacute;t&eacute; recueilli selon lequel a)
certains pays ACP ont &eacute;t&eacute; capables de tirer parti
des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences de sorte que b) leur suppression
entra&icirc;nerait des co&ucirc;ts. Par cons&eacute;quent, le
groupe s'est entendu sur le fait qu'un certain type de r&eacute;gime
d'&eacute;changes pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiels devrait &ecirc;tre
&eacute;tendu au-del&agrave; de l'an 2000 et beaucoup ont estim&eacute;
qu'il devrait &ecirc;tre au moins aussi bon (et si possible meilleur)
que les acquis de Lom&eacute;.
<P>
De mani&egrave;re plus g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, on a estim&eacute;
que la croissance dans le domaine des &eacute;changes d&eacute;pendait
de l'acc&egrave;s au march&eacute; (couvert par le r&eacute;gime
des &eacute;changes de Lom&eacute; et peut-&ecirc;tre am&eacute;lior&eacute;
par des innovations telles qu'un syst&egrave;me de garantie et
de financement de l'exportation) mais aussi des capacit&eacute;s
d'offre (faisant d&eacute;faut dans certains pays ACP mais devant
constituer une priorit&eacute; d'action pour d'autres instruments).
Cette analyse a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e par
plusieurs membres du groupe qui soutenaient que Lom&eacute; devrait
contribuer &agrave; l'&eacute;laboration d'un cadre de r&egrave;gles
veillant &agrave; ce que les transactions commerciales soient
'&eacute;quitables' et garantissant que le commerce contribue
non seulement &agrave; la croissance, mais aussi au d&eacute;veloppement.
<P>
<H3><B>Comment peut-on am&eacute;liorer leur impact?</B></H3>
<P>
Les questions cl&eacute;s sont les suivantes: comment am&eacute;liorer
les dispositions de Lom&eacute; concernant l'acc&egrave;s aux
march&eacute;s et comment assouplir les contraintes de l'offre
(la question des ressources humaines a &eacute;t&eacute; sp&eacute;cifiquement
mentionn&eacute;e) soit en se concentrant davantage sur les actions
d&eacute;j&agrave; autoris&eacute;es par la Convention, soit en
introduisant de nouveaux instruments. On a fait remarquer que
l'impact des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences n'est pas toujours clair.
On s'est accord&eacute; sur le fait qu'il n'existe pas de SOLUTION
unique permettant de r&eacute;soudre tous les aspects du probl&egrave;me
dans tous les pays ACP. Il est essentiel d'adopter une approche
diversifi&eacute;e vu la nature disparate du groupe. Des r&eacute;ponses
compl&egrave;tes n&eacute;cessitent de plus amples informations
sur ce qui a fonctionn&eacute;, ce qui n'a pas r&eacute;ussi et
pourquoi. Le principal sujet de discussion &eacute;tait: jusqu'&agrave;
quel point peut-on arriver &agrave; cette diff&eacute;rentiation
dans le cadre existant et  jusqu'&agrave; quel point cela n&eacute;cessite-t-il
un changement fondamental dans la relation UE-ACP. La discussion
est revenue &agrave; plusieurs reprises sur ce choix.
<P>
<H3><B>Comment g&eacute;rer au mieux les contraintes 'n&eacute;gatives' ?</B></H3>
<P>
Le groupe a tenu un long (et r&eacute;current) d&eacute;bat sur
la meilleure fa&ccedil;on d'aborder les obstacles au maintien
du statu quo, et plus particuli&egrave;rement, l'attitude de l'OMC.
L'avis g&eacute;n&eacute;ral &eacute;tait que:
<P>
* la Convention existante ne cadre pas tr&egrave;s bien avec les
r&egrave;gles actuelles de l'OMC;
<P>
* la situation actuelle laisse &agrave; d&eacute;sirer en ce qui
concerne la pr&eacute;visibilit&eacute; m&ecirc;me si elle pourrait
&ecirc;tre prolong&eacute;e apr&egrave;s l'an 2000;
<P>
* aucune des options actuelles destin&eacute;es &agrave; rendre
Lom&eacute; plus compatible avec l'OMC n'est d&eacute;nu&eacute;e
de probl&egrave;mes, entre autres parce que les r&egrave;gles
de l'OMC n'ont pas &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;dig&eacute;es dans
l'esprit d'un accord du style de Lom&eacute;.
<P>
Etant donn&eacute; ces points d'entente, le d&eacute;bat s'est
concentr&eacute; sur l'&eacute;valuation des pour et des contre
des diff&eacute;rentes modifications pouvant &ecirc;tre apport&eacute;es
aux accords actuels, et les d&eacute;saccords ont en grande partie
d&eacute;coul&eacute; des diff&eacute;rences dans l'appr&eacute;ciation
de l'importance de chacun d'eux. On a &eacute;galement observ&eacute;
une diff&eacute;rence en ce qui concerne le point auquel, s'ils
agissaient de concert, l'UE et les pays ACP pourraient fa&ccedil;onner
l'opinion de l'OMC afin de cr&eacute;er un cadre habilitant plus
appropri&eacute; que l'Article 24 sur les accords Nord-Sud entre
des &eacute;tats disparates. Mais on est arriv&eacute; &agrave;
un consensus sur le fait que l'OMC est avant tout un forum politique
dans lequel l'UE et les &eacute;tats ACP devraient vendre leurs
propositions, quelles qu'elles soient en fin de compte.
<P>
Une fa&ccedil;on de d&eacute;samorcer la critique selon laquelle
Lom&eacute; est discriminatoire serait de permettre une extension
du groupe des membres des ACP. On a sugg&eacute;r&eacute;, par
exemple, que des PMA non ACP pourraient se voir accorder les m&ecirc;me
concessions commerciales que celles qui sont de mise pour tous
dans le cadre de Lom&eacute;. Une telle disposition r&eacute;pondrait
aux critiques de ceux qui, au sein de l'UE, sont m&eacute;contents
de la concentration dans le groupe ACP des anciennes colonies
d'un petit nombre d'&eacute;tats membres.
<P>
La discussion a &eacute;galement comport&eacute; un &eacute;change
de vues anim&eacute; portant sur l'importance de la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;
dans le processus visant &agrave; rendre le r&eacute;gime plus
compatible avec l'OMC. Cela s'est fondu dans un examen plus g&eacute;n&eacute;ral
des avantages et des inconv&eacute;nients de la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;.
On a soutenu que la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; serait favorable
aux &eacute;tats ACP en ce sens qu'elle apporterait les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices
&eacute;conomiques que certains associent &agrave; la lib&eacute;ralisation,
mais aussi qu'il s'agissait d'un &eacute;l&eacute;ment important
dans le processus cens&eacute; rendre Lom&eacute; compatible avec
l'OMC. Les partisans de l'autre point de vue &eacute;taient d'avis
que les gains en efficacit&eacute; &eacute;taient g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement
associ&eacute;s &agrave; une lib&eacute;ralisation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale
pour tous les partenaires commerciaux et non pas &agrave; une
ouverture partielle &agrave; l'un d'entre eux seulement, et qu'en
outre, le lien entre la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; et  l'OMC n'&eacute;tait
pas clairement &eacute;tabli. Il existait un danger que la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;
soit trop faible pour soutenir un cas expos&eacute; dans le cadre
de l'Article 24 de l'OMC (parce que cela ne concernerait que quelques
pays ACP). Une r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; totale au sein du groupe
ACP dans son ensemble (c.&agrave;.d. libre &eacute;change entre
tous les membres) &eacute;tait irr&eacute;alisable politiquement
et l'objectif moins ambitieux de libre &eacute;change entre chaque
pays ACP et l'UE amoindrirait la coh&eacute;sion du groupe.
<P>
<H3><B>Comment g&eacute;rer au mieux les stimuli 'positifs' pour le
changement?</B></H3>
<P>
Une adh&eacute;sion beaucoup plus large a &eacute;t&eacute; not&eacute;e
en ce qui concerne les avantages que comporte la cr&eacute;ation
d'un cadre permettant &agrave; certaines r&eacute;gions ACP d'aller
plus loin que d'autres dans leurs accords commerciaux avec l'UE
et de consentir des 'concessions' mutuelles qui incluraient la
r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;. Une sorte d'approche '&agrave; la carte'
de la relation a obtenu un soutien assez important, mais l'entente
&eacute;tait moindre au sujet de ce qui devrait &ecirc;tre propos&eacute;.
Un point de vue qui a rencontr&eacute; un large soutien, mais
pas l'unanimit&eacute;, fut que les acquis devraient constituer
une plate-forme accessible &agrave; tous et qu'en outre, on pourrait
envisager une aide compl&eacute;mentaire dont la forme varierait
en fonction des besoins des sous-groupes particuliers. Par exemple,
les PMA pourraient avoir besoin d'un suppl&eacute;ment d'aide
pour am&eacute;liorer leurs capacit&eacute;s d'offre tandis que
des &eacute;tats plus comp&eacute;titifs gagneraient &agrave;
b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier d'un meilleur acc&egrave;s, par exemple
sur le plan des services et de l'investissement.
<P>
A la fin de la journ&eacute;e, une tentative d'organiser les options
de mani&egrave;re sch&eacute;matique a cr&eacute;&eacute; autant
de confusion que de clart&eacute; mais cela constitue une approche
pr&eacute;cieuse pour clarifier les choix devant &ecirc;tre pos&eacute;s
et sur lesquels on pourrait se fonder. Il faut en outre rassembler
des informations plus concr&egrave;tes sur les types 'd'accords
additionnels'.

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Italian Development Cooperation</h3>

Official Italian development cooperation started in the 1960s, and was based on considerations of foreign
policy, of which development cooperation forms an integral part. Public support was strong in the 1980s,
but is now declining, apparently under influence of the revelations about management deficiencies and the
existence of parallel political and economic circuits. Reform measures that have been prepared already,
might restore the credibility of the aid organisation. 
<p>
The Government has proposed measures to identify problems and to introduce reforms in the conception,
planning, implementation and organisation of Italy's aid programme. A Special Commission of Experts was
installed in 1992 to examine the programme. In its report to Parliament in February 1993 it has suggested
fundamental changes with regard to the distribution of presently overlapping competencies of government
institutions, simplifying the current complicated administrative procedures, strengthening capacities and
expertise for planning, implementation and evaluation, procurement rules, as well as loosening the narrow
linkages between aid and foreign policy, trade and other national Italian interests, and improving policy
coordination between ministries.
<p>
Italian net official development assistance in 1992 amounted to US $ 4 122 million, which was 0.34 per cent
of GNP. Since the mid-1980s the ODA/GNP ratio had risen notably, reaching 0.42 per cent in 1989. In the
years thereafter actual disbursements fell, which resulted in large amount of undisbursed aid funds.
However, one should bear in mind that figures from different sources may disagree. Aid allocations for the
years 1993 - 1995 are projected to decline further to 0.20 per cent of expected GNP. The proportion of
Italian multilateral aid was always about 40 per cent of ODA, consisting mainly of compulsory
contributions. These rose in 1992 to 14 per cent of ODA to the EU, and to 27 per cent of ODA to other
multilateral organisations.
<p>
The proposed reductions in the total budget have to be borne mainly by the bilateral programme. One of the
reasons for the reductions, imposed by Parliament, was the apparent lack of capacity of the administration to
manage the growing number of projects in the past years. It is doubtful whether these commitments,
together with a decreasing budget, will leave much room for new policies and new projects in the coming
years. 
<p>
<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>
<p>
Italian aid policy remains at present based on an Act from 1987 that established development cooperation as
part of Italian foreign policy, and that refers to the principles of solidarity among peoples, and of human
rights laid down by the UN and confirmed by the Lom&#233; Conventions. The 1987 law also shaped the
administrative structure. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for development cooperation. The
central unit for the management of Italy's aid programme is the Directorate-General of Development
Cooperation (DGCS) in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The DGCS has 19 offices. Three Undersecretaries
of State assist the Minister of Foreign Affairs, one of which handles development cooperation. His position
does not appear to be a strong one. This Undersecretary is also in charge of policies in several other areas.
<p>
The directorate DGCS is also in charge of aid implementation. However, due to lack of capacities at the
DGCS and the embassies, implementation in recipient countries is left to a large extent to private
enterprises, consultants and NGOs.
<p>
Apart from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs three other ministries are involved in development cooperation:
the Treasury, the Ministry of the Budget and Economic Planning, and Ministry of Foreign Trade, the latter
through the Medium Term Loan Bank and the Bank of Italy. Allocations of responsibilities are not known. 
<p>
The law of 1987 created two interministerial committees for decision making as well as a Consultative
Committee. The Interministerial Committee for Development Cooperation (CICS) is chaired by the Minister
of Foreign Affairs, and comprises the Ministers of the Budget and Economic Planning, of Foreign Trade,
and of the Treasury. The CICS mainly sets priorities for the geographical and sectoral distributions of aid.
The second committee, the Steering Committee (or Directing Committee) decides on the allocations of the
annual amount of aid, within the framework established by CICS. The Steering Committee is chaired by the
Under-Secretary for Development Cooperation, and consists of the Directors-General of the same ministries
that are represented in the CICS, and of members of the Consultative Committee.
<p>
Since Italy traditionally has intensive trade relations with developing countries, the Interministerial
Committee for Foreign Economic Policy (CIPES) also plays an important role. After a reorganisation in
1990, a second reorganisation of the aid administration is currently under way, which includes new
mechanisms of interministerial coordination.  
<p>
Systematic planning of country programmes is absent. Bilateral cooperation is based until now on
negotiations with recipient countries. There is no system for regular ex post evaluation. External institutions
have carried out some evaluations, mainly focusing on disbursement aspects. Due to lack of staff, it is
difficult at the moment to integrate evaluation findings into aid management. Proposal are being made for
the establishment of an Evaluation Unit. 
<p>
<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>
<p>
The Consultative Committee on International Cooperation is a consultative body chaired by the Minister of
Foreign Affairs or the Under-Secretary in charge of development cooperation. The Committee has 45
members: five experts appointed by the NGOs, three by the major trade union confederations; ten members
are appointed by institutions and private enterprises operating in development cooperation; five members
belong to the public sector, and five to the private sector; three members are appointed by the Interregional
Commission - representing Italian Regions; one expert is appointed by the National Universities Council,
and one by the National Research Council; one expert represents the Overseas Agronomic Institute, nine
experts represent the State Administrations - civil servants of other ministries involved in development
cooperation - and lastly, both the Director General for Development Cooperation and the Director General
for Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are members of the Committee. Members are
appointed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, following the nomination of the organisations and institutions.
<p>
It is the task of the Consultative Committee to formulate and express opinions about the planning and the
measures elaborated by the Steering Committee, and about the annual report of the CICS. Exerting one of
its tasks, the Consultative Committee informed Parliament in December 1993 that it could not approve the
Annual Report 1992 of the CICS because of a general scarcity of data, and insufficient explanations on the
policies pursued.
<p>
Until recently the Committee had hardly been consulted by the Government. It seems however, that with the
revision of the aid programme and its management, the Committee obtained more relevance. In 1993 it has
established several new working groups for various sections of cooperation. The Government has stated the
intention to take the results of the Committee's work into account. 
<p>
Until recently the role of Parliament in discussing development cooperation has been very limited. Annually
it voted the funds for the aid budget. Discussions on aid programme policies or planning did not take place.
Recently Parliamentarians appear to take more interest in the use of funds and the planning of programmes.
<p>
<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>
<p>
There are many, relatively small, NGOs in Italy. About 120 organisations are eligible for Government co-
funding of their development activities. Another 35 organisation requested that status. Many more
organisations do not seek such status. Private fund raising from the Italian public represents only 12 per cent
(1989-1991) of their total income; the remainder originates from the EU, churches, municipalities, and other
ministries then the MFA. Government funding for NGO activities has been severely curtailed in the years
1992-1993, and sometimes stopped altogether.
<p>
There are no umbrella organisations acting as representatives of their members in dialogue with the
Government. The main vehicle for the policy dialogue is the Consultative Committee, in which NGOs are
represented. There are a number of NGO networks, such as the Catholic Federation Christian Organisations
for International Voluntary Service (FOCSIV), the secular urban based Coordination International
Organisations for Development (COCIS), and the Coordination of International Solidarity People Initiatives
(CIPSI) with small, mainly Catholic NGOs. The Consultative Committee has a working group for NGOs,
chaired by a NGO representative. The working group advises, among other things, the Minister of Foreign
Affairs on eligibility of NGOs. This membership allows the NGO representative to participate in the work
of the interministerial Steering Committee. NGOs participate currently in the discussion on new policies and
structure of development cooperation. Although some structures for policy dialogue do exist, and many
government projects and policy concepts originate from NGO thinking and their partnership relations in the
Third World, the formal and recognised influence of NGOs does not appear to be considerable.
<p>
According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey, 38 institutes in Italy qualify as Development Research and
Training Institutes, some of which are known to be involved in consultancy work for the Government, or to
undertake policy studies. The Centre for Studies in International Politics (CeSPI), an independent research
institute, in 1991 presented a paper with criteria for a new government policy, during an international
conference in Rome, organised by the Government. The Institute for International Economic Cooperation
and Development (ICEPS) provides information on economic cooperation and development, and fosters
Italian initiatives abroad, especially in developing countries. It is composed of prominent members from
politics, culture and private enterprise. 
<p>
As explained the Italian business community appears well represented in various aid institutions until now,
and its interests are integrated in development policy. However, the business community also feels the need
for reforms in the organisation and procedures of aid. A study by the Directorate for Technical Cooperation
of the IRI, the main industrial state holding company, stressed in 1992 inter alia the need for overhauling
the DGCS.

<p>
<h3><a name="int"><hr>Introduction</h3></a>
In its search for a more effective partnership with the African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States, signatories to the Fourth
Lom&eacute; Convention, the European Union has expressed an interest
in broadening its approach to co-operation by developing a more
decentralised dialogue which embraces not only the traditional
partners in government, but also the agents of civil society,
and  in particular economic operators within the private sector.
   
<P>
This is in keeping with current development thinking which foresees
a minimal role for the State in all but the creation of a favourable
physical, social and legal environment within which market forces
can develop and operate effectively. More specifically, this shift
is linked to the EU's larger concern with guaranteeing efficiency
and effectiveness in the use of increasingly scarce aid resources.
  <U>Given its proven role as an 'engine of growth' and a</U>
<U>more efficient user of resources, the private sector increasingly
is being viewed as central to the EU's goal of improving the effectiveness
of future development co-operation programmes with its ACP partners
as well as guaranteeing their future competitiveness and the sustainability
of development efforts.</U> 
<P>
Against this background, the Convention, as revised at the Mid-term
Review, builds on the existing provisions for enterprise development
within ACP countries and places special emphasis on '<I>promoting,
in ACP States, an environment favourable to the development of
the market economy and of the private sector</I>.' (Article 6)
  In this regard, the consensus is that an essential part of this
process involves the identification of new instruments and programmes
which seek to build institutional and technical capacity within
national and regional private sector entities as well as spur
entrepreneurial activities.  For their part ACP Governments have
made an undertaking to encourage '<I>the participation of the
agents of</I> <I>decentralized co-operation in (EDF) Fund projects
and programmes and to [ensure] that their initiatives are taken
into account in the formulation and the implementation of indicative
programmes'.</I> (Annex LXXX)
<P>
<U>The difficulty, however, lies in translating this principle
into a workable practice</U>. Despite the existence of similar
provisions within the original Convention, the European Commission,
at the time of the Mid-term Review in 1994, pointed to a number
of procedural problems in the area of decentralised co-operation
which discouraged the involvement of non-State economic and social
operators in co-operation activities in ACP States. The Commission
noted that the State-centred orientation of  indicative programmes
meant that ACP States made no provision for funds to implement
decentralised co-operation.  Moreover, financing procedures which
reserved a key role at each stage for the National Authorising
Officer (NAO) did not facilitate the kind of direct dialogue with
non-state operators which is key to decentralised co-operation
(See: Commission of the European Communities, <I>Negotiating Directives
for the MidTerm Review of certain provisions of the Fourth Lom&eacute;
Convention: Memorandum from Mr. Marin, </I>Brussels, August 1993.).
In practice, the general trend among the majority of ACP countries
during the first five years of Lom&eacute; IV was that private
sector involvement in the implementation of financial and technical
cooperation activities was 'minimal, if not non-existent'(See:
ACP, <I>The Mid-Term Review of the Fourth Lom&eacute; Convention.
ACP Memorandum to the European Union, </I>(ACP/27/003/94 Rev 3.
Brussels, February 1994).
<P>
<A NAME="b1">In the specific case of the Caribbean ACP (hereafter Cariforum</A>
countries<A HREF="#one">1</A>), a number of programmes aimed at private sector development
were implemented within individual National Indicative Programmes
under the 7th EDF.  Among these is the 'Small Business Credit
Initiative' in Guyana which aims to increase the availability
of credit and provide technical support for small and micro businesses.
A similar programme is under implementation in Trinidad &amp;
Tobago where some ECU 2 million (approximately TT$15 million)
has been committed over a two year period to the Small Businesses
Development Programme which is geared primarily at promoting enterprise
development among the 'least advantaged segments of the society'.
 Further assistance to the Trinidadian  private sector comes through
the Caribbean Business Services Limited or CDI initiative which
provides shop floor technical assistance to local manufacturers.
Other initiatives include the 'Target Europe' programme in Jamaica
which provides assistance to local businesses in export marketing
in Europe as well as the marketing of investment projects in Europe..
<P>
<A NAME="b2">Funds have also been made available under the Caribbean Regional</A>
Indicative Programme (CRIP) to the Caribbean Export Development
Agency (Caribbean Export<A HREF="#two">2</A>)  which aims to boost regional exports
through the provision of in-plant technical assistance, information
on new markets and business opportunities, assistance in promoting
Caribbean products overseas and in developing entrepreneurial
skills throughout the region. The recently implemented 'Trade
Sector Programme' in the Dominican Republic which aims to promote
the competitiveness of Dominican exporters<B> </B>both regionally
and internationally also forms part of this initiative.
<P>
Notwithstanding the existence of these initiatives, the consensus
is that as a percentage of the total allocation within individual
NIPs, the resources allocated to private sector development under
the 7th EDF are not commensurate with the stated importance of
ensuring private sector development both on a national and regional
basis. In the majority of cases, the instruments and programmes
have been too narrow in scope to meet the various and numerous
needs of the regional private sector and only in a few cases are
the programmes managed and implemented by non-State agencies.
In addition,  private sector organisations in individual Cariforum
countries relate a common story of bureaucratic barriers and a
general lack of access to Lom&eacute; resources and information
about those activities (trade fairs etc.) in which their members
would have an interest. Other difficulties are created by bureaucratic
delays which, in most cases, have affected the start-up of income-generating
programmes. Here, the specific case of the Guyana-based Caribbean
Rice Association is worth highlighting. 
<P>
<A NAME="b3">Approximately two years after having submitted a Work Programme</A>
and Cost Estimate for the implementation of a Caribbean Rice Industry
Development Network (CRIDNet<A HREF="#three">3</A>) to the CARIFORUM Secretariat, the
CRA is still awaiting the release of funds.  This has been further
compounded by the delays attending the appointment of the Government
of Trinidad and Tobago as the Deputy Regional Authorising Officer
of the Caribbean Integrated Agriculture and Fisheries Development
Programme under which the CRIDNet Project falls.  In the meantime,
CRIDNet operations have had to be financed by revenue raised by
private sector interests within Guyana and other CRA members.
<P>
In the case of the regional programme managed by Caribbean Export,
there is also the perception among some sections of the Caribbean
private sector that, while the initiative may be laudable, the
level of private sector involvement in the direction, development
 and implementation of projects does not reflect the private sector
nature of the initiative and therefore, could undermine the objectives
of the programme; namely, the development of private sector capacity
within the region.
<P>
Collectively, these have raised serious questions about the level
of commitment on the part of national governments <I>as well as
the European Commission</I> to involving decentralised agents
more directly in the formulation and implementation of programmes
under the NIPs.  Even now, the programming process for the NIPs
under the 8th EDF is proceeding without any significant consultation
with, and in some cases, <I>without the</I> <I>knowledge </I>of
 key national private sector bodies.  The problem is that while
the Convention places importance on <U>the principle</U> of decentralised
co-operation and private sector-led development, <U>in practice</U>
the Lom&eacute; mechanism continues to operate as a government-to-government
agreement with social partners in the private sector having a
very limited window of access.  In the absence of appropriate
mechanisms to facilitate decentralised dialogue and co-operation,
the resistance to the current shift away from government-to-government
co-operation is likely to undermine the principal objective of
Lom&eacute; co-operation in the long term - the achievement of
sustainable development within ACP countries.  In the short term,
the failure of decentralised co-operation is likely to affect
the Commission's ability to create appropriate instruments for
co-operation with the new partners in the private sector after
the expiry of  Lom&eacute; IV in 2000. 
<P>
How, therefore, can the goal of private sector-led development
be achieved within the ACP in general and the Caribbean specifically?
Similarly, how can a more effective partnership be brought about
between the Caribbean ACP and the European Union after the expiry
of Lom&eacute; IV?  What new instruments and mechanisms need to
be identified to minimise bureaucratic delays and bring the regional
private sector more directly into the programming process as well
as the larger Lom&eacute; dialogue?  These are the questions which
the present paper attempts to address. The answers will, no doubt,
form important guidelines which the region, with the support of
the European Union, can use to translate 'the Caribbean's potential
to be a genuine success story in the field of ACP/EU relations'
into a reality.
<P>
The preliminary findings which are laid out in this paper are
the results of a process of consultation by the Caribbean Association
of Industry and Commerce (CAIC) in collaboration with the Caribbean
Council for Europe (CCE), to develop a consensus among member
and non-member private sector organisations throughout the Caribbean
about the general goals of the regional private sector within
a new relationship with the EU as well as the specific needs of
different entities in order to overcome the current constraints
to private sector-led development within the Caribbean. Importantly,
this process has not been confined to a Cariforum-specific context
in that it includes a number of non-Cariforum countries, including
Cuba.  This approach not only takes account of the dynamic set
of relationships within the region which transcends the artificial
boundaries of the Caribbean ACP, but also acknowledges the EU's
long-term ambitions of incorporating Cuba as a beneficiary under
any future co-operation agreement with the Caribbean. 
<P>
The results of the consultation process are laid out over four
sections, the first of which restates the need for a new strategic
alliance with the Caribbean which places the private sector at
the centre of that relationship. Section Two highlights the various
and numerous constraints facing the private section in the region
which need to be addressed as an essential first step towards
ensuring the effectiveness of this new partnership. This is followed
in Section Three by an exploration of possible new approaches
to dialogue and co-operation with the private sector.  The paper
ends by putting forward a number of recommendations for action
in the short, medium and long term both on the part of the European
Union and its partners in Government and the private sector in
the Caribbean.
<P>
The goal is to sensitise the EU to the specific needs of the Caribbean
private sector with the hope that it: a) guarantees increased
and improved access of  national and regional private sector entities
to Lom&eacute; resources; b) impacts favourably on the public
policy implementation of national and regional indicative programmes
under the current EDF and; c) impacts positively on the direction
of EU policy towards the region after 2000.
<P>
<A NAME="1"><h3><hr>Chapter One: The Caribbean Private Sector in Regional Development</h3></A>
<P>
In 1967, when political dialogue on the issue of Caribbean unity
was at a virtual standstill, a six-man team, comprising private
sector leaders from different countries throughout the region
embarked on a bold initiative to encourage heads of governments
to come together to discuss the creation of a free trade area
and other areas of co-operation. Less than a year later in 1968,
the Caribbean Free Trade Area (CARIFTA) was formed.  This represented
the first step in the process towards regional integration which
remains central to the goal of Caribbean development and survival.
<P>
Since that time, the Caribbean business community, both in its
national and regional settings, has played, and continues to play,
a critical role in the ongoing efforts to attain sustainable development
through regional integration. Even now, the impetus within the
Caribbean towards hemispheric integration first through the Association
of Caribbean States (ACS) and more recently, through the projected
formation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) is being
driven largely by private sector interests in the region which
have begun to forge links through trade, joint ventures and other
economic exchanges with their private sector counterparts in a
number of Latin American countries. 
<P>
In the context of CARICOM, it is the indigenous private sector
that has produced the majority of goods and services which fuel
intra-Caricom trade. Cross-regional investment by a growing group
of Caribbean transnationals have also supplemented the earnings
from foreign direct investment in the region, particularly in
the area of  manufacturing and tourism.  In the same way, it is
private sector activity that has fueled the growth of extra-Caricom
trade with non-traditional markets in Latin America, the Far East
and Europe.  
<P>
Increasingly, with the globalisation of world trade and the new
imperative to survive on the basis of international competitiveness
rather than preferential treatment; on trade rather than aid,
it is the private sector, with the help of government, that will
have to steer the Caribbean towards international competitiveness
through the production of quality goods and services which can
compete on international markets.  So, too, with the decline in
bilateral and multilateral aid flows to the region, the private
sector is being called on to fill the gap in terms of capital
accumulation both through indigenous investments and the attraction
of foreign direct investment.
<P>
If nothing else, the new emphasis on the private sector in the
context of global trade liberalisation has drawn attention to
the need for a new dispensation of consultation and co-operation
between Caribbean governments and the social partners in the private
sector and the trade union movement to devise adequate responses
to the several challenges, internal and external, facing the region.
Very tentative initiatives in this direction are underway on a
national level in some Caribbean countries.  On a regional level,
the CARICOM Secretariat has also begun to engage the regional
private sector, represented by the Caribbean Association of Industry
and Commerce (CAIC) in a growing dialogue on issues attending
the formation of the CARICOM Single Market and Economy.
<P>
<h4>CAIC and the Regional Private Sector</h4>
<P>
For  its part, the CAIC  has assumed the mantle of mobilizing
the regional private sector towards preparing  for a new millennium
without trade preferences.  While acknowledging the daunting challenges
posed by the potential loss of trade preferences, particularly
to the region's banana producers, the approach being taken emphasises
the need to <U>survive on the basis of international competitiveness.</U>
<P>
As an essential first step, attention has focused on building
private sector consensus on key issues as well as identifying
common  concerns and perceived threats and opportunities as the
basis for establishing common principles of co-operation for regional
development. <A NAME="b4">An important part of this process is the current</A>
efforts to increase the participation of private sector organisations
in the non-English speaking territories, in particular Suriname
and Haiti, in CAIC activities<A HREF="#4">4</A>.  As a further step towards bringing
the regional private sector into a closer union, the CAIC has
established a Web Site linking member organisations via the INTERNET.
Here, the intention is to provide information about membership
according to country and economic sector. 
<P>
As far as the identification of  a priority agenda is concerned,
attention has focused on expediting progress on the formation
of a CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME) as well as identifying
areas of co-operation within the ACS in order to re-position the
Caribbean in the new global economic order.  Equally important
is the need to diversify the region's export base and improve
the competitiveness and productivity of existing sectors.  The
question arises, however, about the capacity of the region's human
resources as well as the capacity of national and regional public
and private sector institutions to undertake the work necessary
to achieve these goals.  Similar questions arise relating to the
capacity of the region's producers of goods and services to compete
against more efficient world producers.
<P>
In addressing these questions, the CAIC has begun to work on a
number of ideas, including the proposed formation of Working Groups
to monitor and parallel the working groups that have been set
up to deal with the technical issues attending the negotiation
of  the FTAA. It is envisaged that the research generated will
feed the specialised information needs of key public and private
sector bodies as they prepare to negotiate bilateral and multilateral
trade agreements both within and outside the context of the FTAA.
<P>
Importantly, however,  the CAIC continues to stress that accomplishing
the numerous tasks of regional development calls for a new partnership
between government and the social partners in the private sector
based on a division of labour according to <U>capability and efficiency.</U>
 Given the small size of national economies and private sectors
in the region, only a unified approach to investments, production,
marketing and research will offer the region a chance of survival
in the international market place. 
<P>
<h4>Involving the Caribbean Private Sector in EU/Caribbean Co-operation</h4>
<P>
A similar approach is needed in the context of  EU/Caribbean co-operation
in light of the new emphasis on <U>competitiveness</U>,  <U>effectiveness</U>
 and <U>efficiency</U> in the second half of Lom&eacute; IV. As
a more efficient user of resources, private sector involvement
in the implementation of  technical and financial co-operation
is key to ensuring the maximum use of Lom&eacute; resources, particularly
in light of the new financing arrangements governing the use of
programmable resources over the next five years. Private sector
involvement will also see the development of income-generating
projects and programmes which, besides generating employment opportunities,
will reduce the region's dependence on external financial assistance
in the medium to long term.
<P>
Any new strategic alliance between the two regions must, therefore,
place the private sector at the centre of that relationship. 
This is not to say, however, that Caribbean governments will not
continue to play a critical role in that relationship. The relative
inexperience of the region's private sector institutions in the
area of  development co-operation, particularly as it relates
to the working of the Lom&eacute; Convention, will demand a new
partnership between Governments and their private sector counterparts
to draw on the vast experience of the public sector in this area.
 So too, governments continue to play a critical role in the formulation
of macro-economic and fiscal policies, thus creating a favourable
environment within which the private sector can operate. Indeed,
given the right incentives and the appropriate supportive environment,
the Caribbean private sector has the potential to take on many
of the tasks currently performed by the State, thus relieving
pressure on public expenditure and allowing governments to concentrate
its resources on the development of key social and physical infrastructure;
 diversify the economic base by investing in new sectors; and
team up with European partners to invest in competitive and potentially
competitive sectors such as tourism, communication and information
technology.
<P>
Translating that potential into a reality demands a joint effort
between, on the one hand,  Caribbean governments and their private
sector counterparts, and these two together with the European
Union.  Within this framework, there are a number of essential
first steps towards guaranteeing the effectiveness of that partnership
(The author does not list the steps in any order of priority).
These are:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Identifying <U>new mechanisms to facilitate dialogue
</U>between the EU, the private sector and regional governments,
as well as <U>new intermediaries in the private sector to deliver
programmes for the private sector.</U>    In this regard, from
as early as 1993, private sector leaders in the Caribbean called
for the creation of a private sector window in the second part
of Lom&eacute; IV to increase private sector involvement in co-operation
activities.  This argument remains relevant and has to be addressed
as a matter of urgency if the new Partnership 2000 is to be more
effective than the last twenty years of government-to-government
co-operation.
<P>
<li>Identifying new financial instruments through which
the EU can give direct support to the Caribbean private sector.
 The Caribbean's development in the short to medium term depends
largely on the availability of innovative and adequate financial
assistance to facilitate industrial re-structuring and finance
the physical and service infrastructure that underlies an economy
geared towards the global economy.  The continued decline in official
development assistance and bilateral capital flows calls for a
joint effort to explore financing alternatives that facilitate
a transition from preferential to reciprocal trade, take account
of the different development levels and needs in the region and
ultimately facilitate  the effective participation of Caribbean
economies in the new international framework.
<P>
<li><U>Equipping the key private sector actors</U> with
the necessary tools to become equal partners in the Lom&eacute;
relationship while fulfilling their role as the 'engine of growth
in the Caribbean'. Indeed, the <I>development of the private sector</I>
is an important first step towards achieving <I>private sector-led
development.</I> This requires identifying the specific needs
of the private sector within the Caribbean. So far, the discourse
has concentrated on the general needs of the ACP private sector.
The problem with  such an approach is that it does not take account
of region-specific issues and peculiarities which distinguish
the Caribbean private sector from its African counterparts, for
example.  It is important that the EU develops an understanding
of region-specific issues which affect the development of the
private sector in the different regions. From there, one can then
proceed with the development of needs-based programmes and schemes.
</ul>
<P>
These are the essential first steps towards developing a more
effective partnership 2000. Fulfilling those steps calls for new
and creative thinking on the part of the Caribbean and the European
Union.  As is the case with the EU,  that process has only just
begun in the Caribbean.  In the meantime, however, the present
paper provides some preliminary guidelines.
<p>
<A NAME="2"><h3><hr>Chapter Two : Assessing Caribbean Private Sector Needs</h3></A>
<P>
<h4>Context:</h4>
<P>
The assessment of private sector needs in the Caribbean must be
carried out within the context of an understanding of the different
processes at work both internationally and within the hemisphere
which, taken together, are driving economic change in the Caribbean
at a far faster rate than in the rest of the ACP. 
<P>
At the level of the global trading system, new rules attending
the formation of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) mean that
Caribbean countries, like most Developing Countries, have a five
to ten year time horizon to dismantle tariffs and other barriers
to trade.  At the same time, the de-emphasising of Part IV of
the GATT and the reversion to the fundamental principles of non-discrimination
and reciprocity in world trade as a result of the Uruguay Round
have brought into question the legal status of preferential trade
arrangements on which the Caribbean has been weaned and which
have underwritten the viability and stability of a number of key
export sectors in most Caribbean economies.  Within this framework,
the present arrangements governing preferential trade between
the EU and the Caribbean under the Lom&eacute; Convention face
the greatest challenge, particularly from Latin American banana
producers and the US Department of Trade. 
<P>
In the face of such pressure, it is becoming increasingly apparent
that the European Commission favours a future trade relationship
with the ACP based on full-trade reciprocity in order to meet
the EU's Uruguay Round commitments.  Senior European officials
suggest that this is best achieved through the development of
region-specific free trade agreements modeled largely off the
present negotiations with South Africa which envisage, over a
10 year period, that 90% of all EU/South Africa trade including
agricultural produce would not be subject to restriction.
<P>
<A NAME="b5">Similar forces are at work at the hemispheric level, where the
present drive towards hemispheric free trade through the proposed
formation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) foresees</A>
the liberalisation of barriers to trade in goods and services,
elimination of restraints to investments, provision of free labour
movement for specialised workers, and  harmonisation of tax and
monetary policies by 2005<A HREF="#5">5</A>.
<P>
Taken together, all these processes pose a common challenge to
the Caribbean: transitional adjustment and long-term competitiveness.
 This, however, is a gradual process with attendant transitional
problems which require transitional periods of phase-in and phase-out,
as well as financial and technical support to assist in the practical
transformation from the old to the new.  Within this framework,
particular attention should focus on assisting the Caribbean private
sector to underwrite economic transition in preparation for open
markets and globalisation.
<P>
<h4>The State of the Caribbean Private Sector: relative strengths
and weaknesses</h4>
<P>
The European Commission has noted that, except for Haiti, Cariforum
countries are at a higher level of development than most other
ACP countries.  Taken as a group, the same could be said for the
Caribbean private sector as it relates to the relative coherence
of the regional private sector and its ability to formulate common
positions on which to lobby regional governments.  The vibrancy
of the regional private sector is also manifested in the quality
of representation within the various business fora dealing with
the issues attending hemispheric integration.
<P>
This  is not to imply, however, that the Caribbean private sector
is a homogenous grouping.  In the same way that there are varying
levels of development within the region, there is a vast difference
in the capability and level of development of the private sector
as one moves from one territory to the other. In Haiti, for example,
where privatisation efforts are in the very early stages, there
is virtually no private sector and no structures to support private
sector development.  <A NAME="b6">A slightly different situation exists in
Cuba where, for more than 30 years, there was no private sector</A>
in industry, services and retail stores<A HREF="#6">6</A>.  With Cuba  beginning
to insert itself in the world economy, enterprise development
is in the very early stages with the emergence of a number of
autonomous enterprises engaged in a range of activities. This,
however, is not similar to the privatising process taking place
in the former COMECON countries and elsewhere. In the case of
Cuba, the term 'private sector', if it refers to the ownership
of a company, should be understood as 'business sector' or 'entrepreneurial
sector'. This is because the Cuban economy is structured in such
a way that there is a combination of private sector and public
sector, the latter of which continues to play a key role in the
country's economic and social development. 
<P>
In the OECS countries, the lack of economic diversification and
the small size of internal markets have led to a very narrow private
sector  base.  Banana cultivation being the main economic activity
in these islands, there is a relative lack of true business culture
and entrepreneurship due in large part to the failure to develop
linkages in the areas of management, transportation, marketing,
and insurance. This is in stark contrast to, for example, Trinidad
and Tobago which has a well developed and vibrant manufacturing
sector.<B>  </B>Elsewhere, particularly in Jamaica, high interest
rates coupled with high inflation rates and the fluctuation in
the value of the local currency have impacted negatively on local
and foreign investments, particularly in the manufacturing sector.
<P>
This means that different territories will require different types
and differing degrees of assistance. At the same time, one can
identify some common weaknesses across national private sector
institutions (chambers of commerce, manufacturers associations
etc.). These include a lack of technical expertise to analyse
trade data and carry out research on sectoral issues which are
of direct interest to their members. In most cases, this is further
aggravated by a lack of access to specialised trade information.
 As a result, the knowledge of, and ability of most private sector
organisations and members to deal with new issues attending the
formation of the World Trade Organisation and the FTAA, such as
intellectual property rights and sanitary and phytosanitary measures,
is very limited.
<P>
To different extents in different territories, the relative lack
of entrepreneurial skills particularly at the levels of middle
and lower management also act as significant constraints to private
sector development within the region. In turn, this has affected
the region's ability to develop a range of quality products that
can compete effectively on the international market.
<P>
Against this background, current and future co-operation activities
should not only seek to address the numerous and various constraints
to private sector development within the region, they should also
contain a scheme of incentives to ensure that the private sector
is able to underwrite economic transition in the region. Such
an approach is not incompatible with EU policy towards other developing
regions with which it has signed similar advanced partnership
arrangements. This is particularly true in the case of the non-EU
Mediterranean States, where the proposed formation of a Euro-Mediterranean
FTA by 2010 is to be accompanied by appropriate measures to assist
economic transition in the Mediterranean region.  Such measures
include support for the private sector, the primary aim being
to 'make the private sector in the countries of the Mediterranean
capable of withstanding a liberalisation of trade and therefore
also competition on the world market' (European Commission, 'Strengthening
the Mediterranean policy of the European Union: Establishing a
Euro-Mediterranean partnership', <I>Bulletin of the European Union</I>,
 2/95).  Given this approach, there is a case to be made for similar
provisions to assist economic transition in the Caribbean. 
<P>
<h4>New Financial Instruments</h4>
<P>
At present, direct assistance to the Caribbean private sector
comes through the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Centre
for Industrial Development (CDI). 
<P>
<U>The EIB</U> is entrusted with part of the EDF resources to
be used in support of the productive sector and public utilities
in ACP countries in the form of concessionary loans, interest
subsidies on the Bank's loans and contribution of risk capital
to companies stocks. The EIB may also grant loans financed from
its own resources. 
<P>
<U>The CDI's</U> role is to assist in the establishment and strengthening
of industrial enterprises in the ACP States, especially by encouraging
joint initiatives by economic operators of the Community and ACP
states. Over the years, the CDI has operated through a network
of consultants or antennae organisations in different ACP countries
for the provision of  financial and technical assistance in the
areas of training, feasibility and market studies, trade fair
support, business rehabilitation, privatisation and expansion
as well as  start-up and management assistance for small and medium-sized
enterprises.  In the case of the Caribbean ACP, the CDI has been
particularly active in the development of the wood sector, especially
in the Dominican Republic, Guyana and to a lesser extent, Jamaica.
<P>
These instruments have proven inadequate, however, in meeting
the financing needs of the private sector in the region.  This
is particularly true in the case of the CDI with a yearly budget
of 13 million ECU's to finance activities in 70 ACP countries.
An increase in CDI activities over a larger range of sectors and
a larger range of countries in the different ACP regions will
demand a future increase in the resources allocated to that institution
in a successor agreement. This will probably need to be accompanied
by an envelope system with set allocations for each region in
order to ensure that each region and territory benefits equitably
(if not equally) from CDI assistance and facilities.  With this
in place, consideration should also be given to advertising the
services of the CDI in each territory so that more companies are
made aware of how to access CDI assistance. At present, the fear
of over-subscription of the CDI's limited resources is one reason
for the relative lack of awareness among most businesses about
the services offered by the CDI and how to access them. 
<P>
In the case of the EIB,  proposals from  a number of private sector
organisations in the region call for a more dynamic use of EIB
resources aimed at (The proposals which follow are contained in
the presentations made by Jose Armenteros Ruiz of the Santo Domingo
Chamber of Commerce and George Arzeno Brugal, Deputy Chairman
of the CCE at the time of  CCE/CAIC/EC Encounter in Brussels):
<P>
<ul>
<li>Facilitating the establishment of one or more EIB antennae
in the region to more effectively promote and channel EIB facilities
in a number of priority areas, namely export financing and credit
insurance, pre- and post-shipment financing and training programmes
for management and technical upgrading.
<P>
<li>Designing policies that have strong impact on the development
of longer term financial markets, enabling financial institutions
to provide longer-term financial resources to small and medium-sized
enterprises.
<P>
<li>Providing direct loans to private sector organisations
to assist them in creating revolving funds to be used for loans
to SMEs. 
<P>
<li>Placing more emphasis on credit lines to finance Caribbean
exports and stimulate Europe-Caribbean joint ventures and investments
that would contribute to backward and forward linkages, product
diversification and technology transfer.  In the past, these provisions
have not been used effectively. 
<P>
<li>Increasing the EIB's share in foreign exchange rate
risk in order to lower the interest  rates on loans to SMEs. 
<P>
<li>Adopting provisions to spur the development of capital
markets and  stock exchanges to support privatisation and public/private
sector partnerships; and
<P>
<li>Creating a 'sinking fund' in association with private
sector organisations to provide international guarantees for financial
institutions interested in long term loans. Here, the objectives
are to provide for much needed long-term financing to which SMEs
could have access; promote greater capital flows to the region
which could, <I>inter alia,</I> alleviate the balance of payments
problems of Caribbean countries, as well as facilitate and expedite
the assessment procedure involving the credit operations of regional
banks with international financial institutions. 
<P>
</ul>
These proposals underline the need to keep and build on those
instruments of the present Convention which have not been effectively
implemented.  At the same time, additional sources of financing
need to be explored in the framework of the different co-operation
agreements  between the European Union and the French Overseas
Departments (DFAs), the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs)
as well as the Developing Countries of Asia, Latin America and
the Mediterranean.  In this regard, serious consideration should
be given to extending the European Community Investment Partners
(ECIP) scheme to the Caribbean. 
<P>
The ECIP instrument was developed to allow the European Union
to support developing countries through the private sector, rather
than via traditional trade and aid means. The aim of the programme
is to promote business activities in eligible countries through
joint venture arrangements.  Under the latest revision of the
instrument, some ECU 250 million will be made available over the
next five years to investors on varying terms to finance: measures
to identify projects and investment partners; feasibility studies
and/or pilot projects to help businessmen set up joint ventures
or make investments; capital requirements to set up joint venture
or a local company; and training, management and technical assistance.
<P>
To date,  the ECIP instrument has been extended to the developing
countries of Asia, Latin America, the Mediterranean and South
Africa, the so-called ALAMEDSA countries which are 'deemed mature
enough for a more sophisticated market-driven approach' (Reported
in <I>Europe Report</I>,  February 2, 1996). By this same token,
the scheme has not been extended to ACP countries for which, according
to the Commission, 'this new style aid package is not yet realistic'
(Reported in <I>Europe Report</I>,  February 2, 1996). The continued
relevance of this argument is questionable in light of the present
move to develop advanced co-operation agreements with the different
regions within the ACP.
<P>
While the Caribbean private sector is not as mature as its counterparts
in the ALAMEDSA countries, it certainly is more vibrant and at
a higher stage of development than its counterparts in the other
ACP regions, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.  This, plus the
fact that the region is being pushed at a faster pace than the
rest of the ACP to prepare for reciprocity and eventual free trade,
is sufficient ground on which to argue that the Caribbean private
sector should qualify for differential treatment within any new
successor agreement.  Accordingly, in the same way that the EU
has fashioned separate financial instruments such as the AL-INVEST
and MED-INVEST programmes to boost the growth of private enterprise
in the developing countries of Latin America and the non-EU Mediterranean
respectively, consideration should also be given to the creation
of a CAN-INVEST programme for the Caribbean private sector. In
this regard, attention should focus on programmes to support the
development of <U>export-oriented small and medium-sized enterprises</U>
(SMEs) through the encouragement of investments and the establishment
of joint ventures with European firms.  As Development Commissioner
in charge of the ACP, Professor  Jo&atilde;o de Deus Pinhiero
puts it, 'the nuts and bolts of sustainable development lie in
the growth of small and medium sized enterprises.'  This is particularly
 true in the case of the Caribbean where the small size of the
domestic and regional markets has fostered the growth of SMEs
in most sectors.  A general lack of access to adequate and affordable
long term financing has, however,  affected the performance of
these enterprises particularly in the production of quality products
and services which are able to compete on international markets.

<P>
Consideration should also be given to the establishment of an
enterprise fund for the provision of soft loans and grants to
SMEs to purchase capital equipment, invest in appropriate technology
 and expand and upgrade production processes.  This will need
to be accompanied by large scale financial and technical assistance
to develop export potential and improve the quality and competitiveness
of products and services.  Proposals for support in this area
point to a general lack of specialised knowledge relating to market
requirements, standards, packaging and labeling requirements particularly
as they relate to trading with Europe. This calls for the development
of special schemes and programmes to  assist entrepreneurs to
keep abreast of technological and demand changes in export markets
as well as provide assistance in product and packaging design.
 
<P>
A number of  EU-funded programmes such as the 'Target Europe'
programme in Jamaica and the Trade Sector Programme in the Dominican
Republic already offer some assistance to local businesses in
these areas. The introduction of similar programmes in other territories
will need to be accompanied by a significant increase in the resources
committed to these programmes as well as a broadening of the scope
of activities aimed at enterprise development within the Caribbean.
 Such activities include training seminars and workshops especially
for lower and middle management, participation in trade fairs
and trade missions, market research support, consumer promotions,
advice on product and packaging design, partial sponsorship of
marketing activities and technical assistance in the packaging
of investment proposals.  In this way, the EU can help to encourage
the dissemination of  best management and technological practices
and improve the quality and standard of exports from the region.
<P>
Within the same context of enterprise development, attention also
needs to focus on strengthening other private sector organisations
such as <U>chambers of commerce, small</U> <U>business associations,
manufacturers associations, exporters associations and hotel associations</U>,
thus enabling them to  provide more effective support to the business
community which they serve.  In the past, these organisations
generally have been overlooked as <U>direct beneficiaries</U>
of EU assistance.
<P>
On a national level, most countries have well-organised manufacturers
associations, chambers of commerce and exporters associations
which are generally influential with their members and with government
and are increasingly interested in providing common services to
help members improve their competitiveness and export potential.
  To different degrees and varying extents, these organisations
are also working together to make joint presentations on both
social and economic issues to government to improve the operating
conditions for business.   In some cases, however, the effectiveness
of their support to the business community is affected by institutional
weaknesses and a lack of technical and financial resources.
<P>
While different organisations will require different kinds and
different degrees of assistance, in general most of the region's
chambers of commerce share a common need for assistance in the
area of institutional strengthening.  Specific proposals for support
in this area call for programmes aimed at capacity building among
staff to improve administrative efficiency and enhance technical
expertise in a number of areas, in particular programme design
and implementation, market research and trade data analysis. 
<P>
Related proposals from individual chambers of commerce point to
a common problem of a relative lack of vital trade information
and statistics for those sectors in which their members are involved.
Attempts to address this problem are in the very early stages
and require significant assistance from the European Union and
other aid donors. In the Dominican Republic, the C&aacute;mara
de Comercio y Producci&oacute;n de Santo Domingo has requested
EU support in the implementation of a &quot;Trade Information
System' within the Chamber to provide specific information to
the business sector. A similar project has been identified by
the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce which proposes to develop a business
centre within the Chamber with a data bank to access information
both locally and internationally.
<P>
The implementation of similar projects in other organisations
will need to be accompanied by an improvement in communication
links across national and regional organisations to facilitate
the development of a network of private sector organisations through
which information can be disseminated and through which organisations
can share the benefit of expertise and research in different areas.
Proposals out of the Dominican Republic also point to the need
to create linkages with similar organisations in Europe to facilitate
exchanges of information. In this regard, there is a role for
the Caribbean Council for Europe in linking national and regional
organisations into the information flowing out of Europe. The
CCE already keeps regional private sector organisations and governments
abreast of information on those issues in which they have an interest
as well as developments within Europe which impact directly or
indirectly on them.
<P>
Proposals from the combined Chambers of Commerce of the French
Departments in the Americas (DFAs) also point to the importance
of foreign language training, taking into account the growing
exchanges between the different linguistic region's in the wider
Caribbean within the context of regional co-operation efforts.
 This is also an important part of the process of developing linkages
and exchanges of information across private sector organisations
within the wider Caribbean region. 
<P>
Importantly, the aim is to improve the capacity of these organisations,
not only to provide better support to the business community,
but also to act as intermediaries in the delivery of EU-funded
programmes for the private sector.  While it is true that the
majority of  these organisations are in need of institutional
strengthening, the general trend is that even in those cases where
there is a demonstrated ability, these organisations have played
a very marginal role in the planning and delivery of programmes
for their members, in particular small and medium sized enterprises.
The non-involvement of these private sector-support institutions
is largely responsible for the general lack of information about
the operation of the Convention and the opportunities for funding
and involvement in other co-operation activities. The increased
participation of non-State actors in development programmes, will
call for measures aimed at capacity building to improve the ability
of  private sector organisations to effectively and efficiently
implement programmes for their members in the private sector.
 
<P>
In this sense, the remaining five years of Lom&eacute; IV should
be regarded as an important transition period for preparing non-State
agencies to play a more active role in the  delivery of EU/Caribbean
co-operation activities.  Preliminary recommendations in this
area called for training seminars and workshops to familiarise
private sector institutions and other decentralised agents with
the Lom&eacute; financing and programming procedures as well as
the operation of the aid and trade instruments (See M.A.Lowe,
 <I>Europe and the Caribbean: Planning for a 'Partnership 2000',</I>
January 1996). Most organisations will also require training in
the preparation of financing proposals as well as project appraisal
and evaluation.
<P>
<h4>Assistance to regional private sector associations</h4>
<P>
On a regional level, a number of private sector associations exist
which have been working to attract investments, develop the competitiveness
of their respective sectors and effectively lobby regional governments
and in some cases, international organisations, on behalf of exporters
and operators in their respective sectors.  Such sectors include
tourism, rum and rice - all of which are truly-private sector
driven and, particularly in the case of tourism, are of great
importance in the region's drive for international competitiveness
and sustainable development.   In all three cases, however, these
associations have had difficulty getting EU assistance to develop,
fund and implement programmes which aim to increase the viability
of the particular sector and in the long-run, ensure the sustainability
of development efforts in the region.  Again, this raises the
question about the level of commitment both on the part of regional
governments and the EU, to engage with the private sector in the
search for paths to sustainable development.   If the EU is serious
about supporting private sector-led development in the Caribbean,
these are the organisations on which it should focus its attention.
Future co-operation activities between the two regions should
take account of the concerns expressed by regional private sector
 organisations as well as improve the record of assistance to
these organisations in their efforts to develop their  respective
sectors.  
<P>
<U>The Caribbean Hotel Association</U> (CHA) is the principal
force working in the region to secure foreign investment in the
tourism industry.  Comprising some 1000 private Caribbean Hotel
members and 600 allied members including airlines, travel agencies,
restaurant suppliers and trade and consumer press, the CHA is
truly private sector, regional in nature and properly representative
of the regional tourism industry.  
<P>
The Caribbean sub-region remains the world's most 'tourism dependent'
region with the sector accounting for approximately 25% of all
exports of goods and services.  Tourism promises to be the region's
median for economic growth and stability, with a projected annual
growth rate of 4.6% by the year 2000. As such, priority has been
placed on expanding the tourism market base within the wider European
market and increasing European investments in the regional tourism
industry. 
<P>
In the meantime, there is the need to continue activities aimed
at product development and marketing to improve the competitiveness
of the industry.  Hotel accommodation being the largest revenue
earner in the tourism industry, the CHA has highlighted a number
of areas in the hotel sector in which external assistance is needed
when aiming to achieve long term success in the tourism industry.
<A NAME="b7"> Critical among these is the need for assistance in the area of</A>
training and human resource development. CHA initiatives<A HREF="#7">7</A> in this
area have begun the process of improving hotel management standards
in the region. Assistance is needed, however, to fund the various
work sessions under the several training programmes which have
been established. The CHA has also highlighted the need for financial
assistance in the current efforts to upgrade the level of training
being provided at Hotel Management/Training Schools across the
region to accepted international levels of certification. A comprehensive
model has been developed under the auspices of Sir Alister McIntyre,
Vice Chancellor of the University of the West Indies.  This model
has been endorsed by the Heads of the ACS territories and the
private sector.  A US$5 million fund would be required to initiate
the presented activities.
<P>
In the same context of human resource development, EU assistance
is also required to fund technology workshops to educate hoteliers
on the marketing implications generated by the continuing development
of the INTERNET and other related activities. Other proposals
highlight the need for significant refurbishment of hotel properties
as well as assistance to property owners in the provision of expert
advice in four key areas namely, operations and financial management,
marketing, architecture and engineering and food and beverage.
 CHA statistics indicate that of the 1,000 hotel members in 32
Caribbean nations, a significant proportion are operationally
inefficient and sufficiently unprofitable to be on the verge of
bankruptcy.  This, according to the CHA is largely due to the
fact that many hotels in the region were built and mortgages granted
without benefit of professional feasibility studies. Currently,
the Caribbean Hotel Advisory Council (CHAC) is the only body that
is available to assist hoteliers with their building and management
difficulties. In order to augment the work of the CHAC, the CHA
has proposed the establishment of a resource group with expertise
in the four areas highlighted above to analyse ailing properties
and make recommendations for their revitalisation.  EU assistance
in this regard, would be in the form of financial assistance to
initially establish the resource group, which the CHA foresees
would become self-sustaining through the payment of fees in the
future.
<P>
The CHA has also been extremely involved with sustainable tourism
activities specifically those focusing on the preservation of
the environment. A Hoteliers ToolKit, Environmental Signage, Environmental
Awards, a video and training seminar are just some of the projects
that have been self-funded. This type of vital effort could be
broadened and intensified with the addition of an Environmental
desk within CHA's headquarters. 
<P>
<U>The Caribbean Rice Association</U> (CRA) embraces rice industry
operators in CARICOM, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba and
provides a forum for the participation of producers at Field and
Milling levels and marketers/distributors and suppliers of inputs
and services to the region's Rice Industry. The CRA was established
in 1993 to promote the development, growth and expansion of the
regional rice industry and to encourage the development of linkage
industries through the provision of technical assistance, business
guidance and the procurement of credit and other forms of economic
assistance and services to operators in the industry and associated
activities.  
<P>
Until quite recently, activity in the Caribbean ACP rice industry
was at a relatively low level  with exports going to Europe under
a quota fixed at 125,000 tonnes of husked rice and 17, 000 tonnes
of broken rice at a levy of around 50 per cent of that applied
to rice form non-preferred nations.   However, under a provision
aimed at encouraging economic development in the smallest nations
of the Caribbean, the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT
-- Montserrat, Turks and Caicos, Anguilla, Cayman, British Virgin
Islands and the Netherlands Antilles) a special EU derogation
was agreed for Caribbean ACP rice to be processed in those nations.
 Under this arrangement ACP rice can be milled in the OCT and
enter the EU quota-free and not subject to levy.  
<P>
This has contributed to the impressive growth of the rice industries
in Guyana and Suriname since 1992.  In Guyana, the industry has
become a key component of that nation's economic recovery,  earning
over US$76 million per annum and contributing some 19% of agricultural
GDP and 12.5% of export earnings. Importantly, the industry is
not controlled by government, has no subsidies and principally
consists of small and medium sized privately owned farms and privately
owned mills. <U> In short, it is exactly the type of industry
Europe wishes to see prosper in the Caribbean.</U>
<P>
Recent challenges from a number of European rice producers to
the current arrangements governing the entry of ACP rice into
the EC market through the OCTs pose a number of threats to the
continued viability of this industry. Spain, Italy and France,
all domestic European producers of rice at relatively high cost,
have been threatening to introduce safeguard measures to ban ACP
rice entering through the  OCT unless the European Commission
arrives at a solution on how to develop new regulations to control
ACP shipments through the OCT.  While the EU has indicated that
it has no immediate intention to stop the arrangements for shipment
through the OCT route, the CRA has put forward a number of proposals
aimed at better organised access for ACP rice which, in the medium
to long term, will ensure that  ACP rice will be able to compete
on an equitable basis in the EU market.  
<P>
The proposals call for the establishment of quotas for ACP rice
milled in the OCT, subject to an annual upward review up to the
end of Lom&eacute; IV. Such quotas should be set in a manner that
takes account of the growth in the level of rice production in
ACP exporting nations while making special provisions for the
least developed of the OCTs.  Further, such quotas should be determined
in the light of any change to the existing ACP quotas for rice
for direct export to the EU on the basis of a reducing tariff.
 Other proposals include the establishment of a price mechanism
at the same level prevailing for EU producers. 
<P>
The CRA has also highlighted the need for EU assistance in developing
the quality of ACP rice exports in order to ensure the continued
viability of this sector beyond the expiry of Lom&eacute; IV in
2000.  In this regard, priority should be placed on expediting
the release of funds for the implementation of activities and
programmes under the Caribbean Rice Industry Development Network
(CRIDNet).  The CRIDNet aims to enhance the competitiveness of
the regional rice industry by improving efficiency in research
and training and linking regional industry operators with international
rice industry institutions. CRIDNet activities have been affected,
however, by the delay in the release of Lom&eacute; funds under
the Caribbean Regional Indicative Programme (CRIP).  
<P>
EU support is also needed in the development of programmes aimed
at increasing yields within the industry.  The CRA has pointed
to production-based problems which range from the lack of mechanisation
to pest infestation and disease. So too, problems with the handling
of bulk at all stages call for assistance to upgrade transport
facilities prior to shipping in order to maintain quality and
facilitate loading. 
<P>
A case can also be made for institutional support within the CRA
Secretariat to allow it more direct input in the implementation
of CRIDNet programmes as well as the Regional Rice Development
Programme under the CARIFORUM Integrated Agriculture and Fisheries
Development Programme. So far, capacity constraints within the
CRA Secretariat have necessitated the appointment of the Caribbean
Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) as the
Executing Agency of CRIDNet activities.  The CRA has also appointed
a Technical Advisory Committee to advise the Association on the
Work Programme of the Network. CRA involvement in Lom&eacute;
activities will bring about a more coherent regional approach
to the development of the regional rice industry.
<P>
<U>The West Indies Rum and Spirits Producers Association</U> (WIRSPA)
brings together distillers, brewers and suppliers from the major
rum exporting countries of Guyana, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Barbados,
Trinidad and Tobago, St. Lucia, Antigua and the Dominican Republic.
  Increasingly, the organisation has become an effective lobby
group on issues affecting Caribbean rum exporters on the European
market.
<P>
Rum is one industrial product where Caribbean ACP producers have
achieved international competitiveness and, unlike rum producers
in the French DOMs of Reunion, Martinique and Guadeloupe, Caribbean
producers enjoy no subsidies nor benefit from special pricing
arrangements. Despite the recent abolition of tariffs on ACP light
rum and the progressive increase in the quota for traditional
rum until abolition in 1999, the Caribbean rum industry faces
an ever-increasing number of challenges in the European market
both before and after the year 2000.  Its competitiveness and
ability to strengthen its position in the European market for
both bulk rum and branded products will continue to be subject
to threats from a variety of sources. Chief among these is the
competition from higher cost DOM producers who, even now, are
seeking to expand their market in Europe through the maintenance
of special preferential mechanisms available only to European
rum producers.  For Caribbean ACP producers, this is aggravated
by the erosion of what little preference they have in the European
market after the year 2000 as other producing nations are able
to enter an increasingly liberalised market.  There is also the
continuing danger that the GSP might be extended to a wider range
of nations able to produce rum for the European market.  Add to
this, the continuing uncertainties about ersatz rum produced in
Central and Eastern Europe if  these nations become members of
the EU.
<P>
In the light of all these developments, WIRSPA has begun to stress
that  because quotas were created and then maintained for so long
on ACP rum, the industry will require special transitional support
both in the second  part of Lom&eacute; IV and  after the Convention's
expiry in 2000. In the meantime, industry operators have recognized
the need to increase marketing and promotional activities in Europe
in order to establish product and brand awareness of 'Caribbean'
rum as being the only genuine rum. Industry operators will require
financial assistance, however, to meet the huge marketing costs
involved in such large scale promotional activities.  There is
also the need for technical support to enable the industry to
ensure the continuing competitiveness in the European market through
assistance with issues such as meeting international norms, financing
effluent control systems and market studies on new EU member states
as potential markets for ACP rum.
<P>
<U>The Windward Islands Farmers Association</U> (WINFA)  is a
sub-regional grouping of national small farmers associations across
five of the Windward Islands namely, Martinique, St. Lucia, Grenada,
Dominica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  Besides its role
in the area of advocacy on behalf of its members, WINFA activities
include farmer training and education through the promotion of
farmer exchanges within and outside of the region, particularly
in Central America, to learn production processes and facilitate
some exchange of technology.  WINFA also promotes the participation
of women in all areas of agriculture.
<P>
Agriculture being the main stay of the economies in WINFA member
countries, Europe represents the main market for these countries,
accounting in 1990  for 63.1 % of St. Lucia's exports, 63.0% for
Grenada, 59.2% for Dominica and 50.9% for St. Vincent. Banana
exports contributed to the majority of that total, accounting
for 78.3% of total agricultural exports from the Windward Islands
in 1990. Given the current threat to the preferential arrangements
for Windward Island bananas, WINFA has begun to concentrate on
activities aimed at diversification 'around bananas' rather than
'out of bananas'.  This approach acknowledges the need to expand
the export base in these countries, not through the abandonment
of banana cultivation but through the creation of linkages between
agriculture (bananas) and other industries, for example, tourism
which increasingly is becoming an important source of revenue
in these islands.  Here, the major concern is with guaranteeing
the food security in these islands while increasing the productivity
and viability of agricultural production.
<P>
To this end, WINFA has pointed to the need for medium/long term
financial and technical assistance to member organisations in
order to increase export capacity, enhance competitiveness and
ensure the successful restructuring of the banana industry in
the Windward Islands.  Specific proposals call for EU assistance
to farmers through the provision of training in improved technologies
as well as the provision of agricultural inputs and equipment.
There is also the need for farmer training in order to meet market
requirements as well as training in production management and
the development of entrepreneurial skills.  Other suggested programmes
include farmer exchanges to provide hands-on training in technology
adaptation.
<P>
<h4>Creating a favourable physical and regulatory environment
for private sector development.</h4>
<P>
Private sector development also depends on the ability of national
governments to implement sound macro-economic and sectoral policies
and provide the necessary infrastructure to support the growth
of private enterprise. Capacity problems within the public sector
and the continuing burden of debt in a number of countries, however,
 have affected the ability of national governments to create a
social and financial climate conducive to attracting foreign capital
and developing small businesses.  There is, therefore, the need
for continued support to Governments as they  perform the complex
tasks of structural adjustment. This includes financial assistance
in the development of infrastructure and other long-term development
programmes in the area of education, health, the environment and
population control, as well as technical assistance to build administrative
capacity and improve technical  expertise within the public sector.
 As with the private sector, particular attention should focus
on activities and programmes aimed at developing analytical  and
other research skills to keep abreast of economic trends and evaluate
the impact of liberalisation on  certain sectors and products.
 
<P>
With the present move towards regional integration, there is also
the need for policy reform to remove current constraints to intra-regional
economic activity and eventually harmonise policies in a number
of areas. Preliminary proposals for support in this area call
 for technical assistance to regional governments to enable studies
to be undertaken for recommending the best methods for reform
and harmonisation of policies between countries (See: Gill, Hess
and Pellerano, <I>A new strategy to promote regional integration
in the Caribbean region,</I> Draft report prepared on behalf of
the European Commission, October 1995). Specific areas highlighted
in which policy, legal and regulatory reform and harmonisation
are needed include trade (tariff reform, customs regulations and
documentation, rules of origin and competition policy); fiscal
regulations (harmonisation of fiscal regimes); standardisation
(product quality requirements); investment and company regulations
(investment codes, treatment of foreign investors and bankruptcy
laws); environmental regulations and exchange rate policies. The
proposals also highlight the need to improve the technology for
capital market transactions in the region as well as assistance
to strengthen existing stock exchanges in Barbados, Jamaica and
Trinidad and to improve capital market instruments. To these,
one should add the need for assistance to develop proper communication
and transportation (air and maritime) channels within and between
the countries of the region.  <A NAME="b8">This is vital in the development</A>
of effective regional co-operation activities, particularly as
it relates to trade and the use of the cumulation provision of
the Convention<A HREF="#8">8</A>. 
<P>
Special consideration also needs to be given to the potential
role of the French Departments in the Americas (DFAs) when developing
ideas in the area of regional co-operation.  Although contacts
and exchanges are increasing in many fields such as the arts,
sports and the fight against drugs, there is still much to be
done to initiate and structure a truly fruitful regional co-operation
for mutual development. As Europe in the Caribbean, the DFAs present
 a unique opportunity  for co-operation in the area of trade,
tourism and services activities.   In suggesting some areas in
which the most important and meaningful projects could be implemented
to foster mutual and balanced development through regional co-operation,
the combined Chambers of Commerce of the DFAs have highlighted
regional air and maritime transport for the development of exchanges
and trade; tourism, taking into consideration the growing importance
of Europe as a market; and the establishment of joint ventures
for the processing of some agricultural produce for export to
the European market. 
<P>
Importantly, the ideas contained in this paper are not meant to
be exhaustive but to indicate the broad areas in which EU assistance
is needed in the short to medium term in order to guarantee sustainable
development in the Caribbean region. More detail on these ideas
and proposals appears in the individual submissions from a number
of Caribbean private sector organisations contained in an Annex
to the present paper. 
<P>
<A NAME="3"><h3><hr>Chapter Three: New Modalities of EU/Caribbean Co-operation</h3></A>
<P>
<h4>Identifying new mechanisms for dialogue</h4>
<P>
The past twenty years of Lom&eacute; co-operation have evolved
a number of institutions in which the European Union has conducted
dialogue with its ACP partners on the range of issues which attend
the Convention:
<P>
<U>The Council of Ministers</U> is the policy-making body of the
Convention, consisting of, on the one hand, representatives of
the 15 EU Member States and members of the European Commission
and, on the other hand, ACP government members. It is also the
forum for the conduct of an enlarged political dialogue, particularly
on issues of human rights, good governance and the rule of law
which were recently incorporated as essential elements of the
Convention.  
<P>
<U>The Committee of Ambassadors</U> is the supportive arm of the
Council and is composed of, on the one hand, ACP Ambassadors to
the EU and, on the other, each Member State's permanent representative
to the European Union and one representative of the Commission.
<P>
<U>The Joint Assembly</U> is the consultative body of the Convention,
consisting of representatives from the European Parliament and
a mixture of ACP Parliamentarians and Diplomats.  The Joint Assembly
is charged with the task of reflecting upon all matters pertaining
to ACP-EU co-operation and formulating proposals with a view to
improving and reinforcing co-operation in all areas.
<P>
With the exception of the Joint Assembly, which facilitates dialogue
with a number of European NGDOs, the composition of the institutions
reinforces the government-to-government nature of co-operation
that has characterised the Lom&eacute; relationship to date. 
The same is true for regional mechanisms such as CARIFORUM and
the formal arrangements and procedures that govern the implementation
of technical and financial co-operation in individual ACP States.
 In the absence of a formal mechanism for direct dialogue with
the European Commission and its Member States,  a number of key
private sector associations in the Caribbean, in particular regional
associations representing producers groups and tourism interests
have had to rely on informal channels within Europe such as the
Caribbean Council for Europe to facilitate direct dialogue with
the Commission and EU Member States on those issues which impact
directly on them.
<P>
While the outcome of these encounters has been positive, the development
of a future <U>coherent</U> regional policy needs to be accompanied
by the creation of new mechanisms or the revision of existing
ones to facilitate a more decentralised dialogue which embraces
all the actors in civil society. The present shift towards region-specific
arrangements will, in all probability, lead to a decentralisation
of the Lom&eacute; dialogue to regional mechanisms. In the case
of the Caribbean ACP, this focuses attention on CARIFORUM as the
most likely forum for the conduct of an enlarged policy and political
dialogue between the EU and Cariforum countries in the future.

<P>
At present, CARIFORUM acts as a forum for ongoing exchanges<B>
</B>among Caribbean ACP Ministers. While there is some resistance
to the idea of broadening membership to include representatives
from the private sector and the rest of civil society, short of
creating a new mechanism at this time, this seems to be the most
logical step, at least in the short to medium term. The idea is
to find creative ways of using the existing structures of the
Convention to facilitate dialogue with the vast range of actors
in civil society, thereby ensuring that future policy decisions
are the outcome of genuine consultation between governments and
private sector interests. In this way, while the conduct of negotiations
for a successor agreement may remain the domain of governments
and their representatives, the development of negotiating stances
based on minimum and maximum expectations would have been arrived
at through a process of consultation with significant input from
private sector organisations and their representatives. Broadening
the CARIFORUM membership base would also facilitate increased
participation  of regional private sector organisations in the
formulation and implementation of regional projects and programmes
under the current EDF.
<P>
The proposal, therefore, is to upgrade the CARIFORUM mechanism
in the shortest possible time into an effective regional forum
with representatives from Governments, the regional private sector
and other regional groupings representing trade unions, women's
groups and academia.  In the case of the regional private sector,
preliminary proposals regarding membership include the CAIC and
a representative from each of the regional private sector associations
namely, the Caribbean Hotel Association, West Indies Rum and Spirits
Producers Association, the Caribbean Rice Association, the Windward
Island Farmers Association (WINFA) and the St. Lucia Banana Growers
Association.  Here, the rationale is that the CAIC, by virtue
of its membership and operational structure, already represents
and articulates regional private sector positions in the forum
of CARICOM, the ACS and the Business Network for Hemispheric Integration
(BNHI) which aims to become the private sector vehicle for the
implementation of Free Trade in the Americas by the year 2005.
CAIC membership in CARIFORUM would be a natural extension of this
role.  But, to the extent that the CAIC cannot deal adequately
with sector-specific issues such as the conditions of access for
Caribbean rum and rice into the EC, then there is need for representation
from regional associations. 
<P>
On a national level, there still exists some difficulty in initiating
ongoing and meaningful private sector/ public sector dialogue.
While, this is a matter to be worked out between national governments
and their counterparts in the private sector, there is a role
for EU Delegates in each territory in identifying the key private
sector institutions and, together with the National Authorising
Officer, begin to engage them in dialogue on the working of the
Convention.  This is an essential part of the process of identifying
new intermediaries in the private sector capable of delivering
programmes for the private sector.
<P>
<h4>Identifying new intermediaries in the Private Sector </h4>
<P>
According to the terms and conditions governing development finance
co-operation, financial assistance may be made available to or
through the ACP States concerned or, <I>subject to their </I>agreement,
either through eligible financial institutions or directly to
any other eligible beneficiary. (Art 233 (3)) Further provisions
exist for the granting of financial assistance to the final recipient
<U>through an intermediary  or directly to the final beneficiary
in the private sector.  (Art. 233 (4)(a)(b))</U>
<P>
In the case of the Caribbean, one can identify few private sector
programmes that are owned and delivered by non-State intermediaries.
 In Guyana, the UK-based NGO, Co-operation for Development was
appointed as a consultant to implement the Small Business Credit
Initiative using funds left over from the 1990-94 NIP. In Trinidad,
Caribbean Business Services Limited (CBSL) was incorporated as
a private company in December 1994 with local private sector shareholding
to provide shop floor technical assistance to local manufacturers
under the CDI initiative.  In the Dominican Republic, the C&aacute;mara
de Comercio y Producci&oacute;n de Santo Domingo is also the agency
in charge of implementing the Trade Sector Programme under the
Caribbean Regional Indicative Programme .
<P>
The general trend, however, is that financial assistance to the
private sector has been administered largely through government
or quasi-governmental agencies. In some cases, this occurs despite
the existence of  eligible private sector organisations. This
is particularly true in the specific case of the Caribbean Hotel
Association, which, despite its key role in securing  foreign
private investment in the regional tourism industry as well as
its demonstrated record of  successful project development, has
played a very marginal role in the implementation of the Caribbean
Integrated Tourism Development Programme under the Regional Indicative
Programme.
<P>
The lack of significant private sector input in developmental
projects is one reason for the slow pace of implementation. The
successful planning and implementation of long-term development
projects such as those in the tourism sector require some certainty
about the level of available resources. Unlike the public sector
which has limited sources of funding, private institutions are
much more flexible in their funding and will be able to work easily
with the Caribbean on financing projects. There is, therefore,
a clear requirement to identify key players in the private sector
which have the potential to act as intermediaries to deliver and
access counterpart funds for private sector programmes. Often
these organisations are better equipped to formulate projects,
implement them faster, more efficiently and at a much lower cost.
Moreover, the incentive to succeed is greater when private sector
programmes are owned by recipients or intermediaries in the private
sector rather than by governments. 
<P>
Again, this calls for a greater role for members of EU delegations
in each territory to identify and decide the efficiency, integrity
and accountability of potential private sector intermediaries.
One proposal out of Guyana has suggested adopting a sectoral approach
to the identification of such intermediaries thereby linking programmes
to sectoral organisations with a proven or potential capability
to implement projects.  This is similar to the current approach
under the Caribbean Regional Indicative Programme (CRIP) wherein
programmes are linked to regional organisations and agencies in
that particular sector.
<P>
On a national and regional level, a number of private sector bodies
exist which, <U>provided they can be strengthened institutionally</U>,
have the potential to act as intermediaries and partners in the
delivery of private sector programmes. The Trinidad and Tobago
Manufacturers Association (TTMA) is one such example, having had
experience in managing the disbursement of funds to the local
private sector under World Bank and IMF programmes.  Others include
the CHA, CAIC, CRA, and WINFA. 
<P>
<A NAME="b9">The recently established <U>Caribbean Enterprise Foundation</A> </U>(CEF<A HREF="#9">9</A>),
also presents an interesting model  for the delivery of private
sector programmes within the Caribbean. A largely Eastern Caribbean
private sector initiative to develop the private sector, the CEF
aims to identify new market-driven commercial opportunities; help
entrepreneurs (particularly small businesses and new entrants
to the private sector) to diversify their products and services;
and encourage and assist enterprises become more export-oriented.

<P>
Given its potential for helping the regional private sector to
create export competitive products and services for regional and
extra-regional markets and, given its potential to identify counterpart
funds from other multilateral agencies, there is clearly a future
role for the CEF in the development and implementation of programmes
for the private sector under future co-operation activities between
the EU and the Caribbean.
<P>
<h4>New Programming and Financing Arrangements?</h4>
<P>
Under the present arrangements, ACP Governments are responsible
for:  defining the objectives and priorities on which the indicative
programmes are based; choosing the programmes and projects to
be financed; preparing and presenting programme/project dossiers;
programme implementation and management; and maintaining projects/programmes.
  The financing arrangements for each project/programme are determined
jointly by the ACP State and the EU.  Thereafter, financial assistance
may be made available to or through the ACP States or, <I>subject
to</I> <I>their agreement</I>, either through eligible financial
institutions or directly to any other eligible beneficiary. (Art.
222 (2)(a-f);  233(2-3))
<P>
In effect, the extent to which decentralised agents can have access
to Lom&eacute; resources is entirely dependent on the willingness
of ACP governments to grant such access. This accounted in large
part for the poor results of de-centralised co-operation activities
in the first half of Lom&eacute; IV.  In order to eliminate the
red tape, the European Commission proposed, at the time of the
Mid-term review, to revise the procedures governing the drawing
up of indicative programmes. Accordingly, ACP Governments would
be requested to indicate: the amount set aside for decentralised
co-operation activities; the principles and conditions under which
funds would be deployed; and the categories of beneficiaries.
Thereafter, decentralised actors would submit projects directly
to the Commission which would examine each project and inform
the National Authorising Officer in each country of the projects
to be supported. 
<P>
While acknowledging the need to ensure greater participation of
decentralised agents, ACP Governments rejected the Commission's
proposals on the grounds that this would challenge the authority
of the ACP Government or delegated authority to determine the
use of NIP resources. Moreover, with the  EU exercising considerable
discretionary powers over the selection of programmes for funding,
there was no guarantee that decentralised co-operation activities
would dovetail into the national development plan.  Importantly,
this is in keeping with the principles of partnership and the
recognised right of  ACP States to determine their development
principles, strategies and models in all sovereignty. (Art. 3)
  
<P>
There still exists, however, a need to devise new arrangements
to increase private sector access to Lom&eacute; resources, eliminate
the red tape and minimise the bureaucratic delays both on the
ACP side and on the Commission side. Proposals from Caribbean
private sector organisations support direct access to funds through
the creation of a separate private sector window in any successor
agreement.  ACP Governments and Commission Members have yet to
come to terms with this idea. The precise arrangements would have
to be worked out in such a way that they do not create a competitive
situation between government and their private sector counterparts
and more importantly, that they do not appear to undermine the
recognised right of Caribbean governments to determine their development
principles, strategies and models in all sovereignty.
<P>
Preliminary proposals suggested identifying an eligible regional
financial institution capable of managing the disbursement of
Lom&eacute; funds for private sector programmes within the different
territories. Such an approach would not be incompatible with the
existing provisions of  the present Convention which stipulate
that financial assistance may be made available through eligible
financial institutions subject to the agreement of the ACP States.
In this regard, the Caribbean Development Bank was seen as an
interesting model by virtue of its membership, operational structure
and its central role in development activities within the region.

<P>
<A NAME="b10">A small regional financial institution relative to other multilateral
development banks, the CDB links 25 countries from three continents
</A>and the Caribbean<A HREF="#10">10</A>.  As the largest source of external development
finance, particularly for the less developed countries of the
region, the institution plays a central role in assisting members
in the co-ordination of their development programmes; financing
development projects and programmes; mobilizing additional financial
resources from within and outside the region for development purposes;
and providing technical assistance particularly by undertaking
or commissioning pre-investment surveys and by assisting in the
identification and preparation of project proposals.  The CDB
assists private sector development either by participating with
co-financiers in direct loans to private entities and enterprises
or indirectly by lending to financial intermediaries in the borrowing
member countries to be on lent to private enterprises. Priority
is placed on activities and programmes which  contribute to economic
development and have a potential multiplier effect in economic
activity in the borrower country. 
<P>
Using the CDB model, the proposal was to establish a special private
sector window within the bank exclusively to administer EU funds
for approved private sector programmes. Such an approach might
involve the creation of a foundation able to receive funding from
other bilateral and multilateral  institutions and  from private
sector financial bodies. The new window might be controlled by
a board bringing together representatives of governments, donor
bodies and the private sector and might see the establishment
of national desks coordinated by a regional coordinator who, collectively,
would work with private sector intermediaries in the different
territories to deliver programmes/projects.  Each national desk
would liaise directly with the EU Delegation Office in the different
territories and assist in the quarterly reviews of projects/programmes.
 
<P>
Participants from the Caribbean private sector at the time of
the CCE/CAIC/EC Encounter in Brussels advised caution, however,
in the choice of the CDB as an institutional model due largely
to that institution's past record in the delivery of projects.
In this regard, attention focused on the issue of timing which
Caribbean private sector representatives underlined as crucial
when seeking to work with the private sector. Whereas the CDB
might take 12-18 months to process a loan, the nature of private
sector projects are such that they demand a shorter processing
period, failing which the proposed project would die a natural
death. Instead, Caribbean private sector representatives suggested
identifying eligible national financial institutions such as 
the Trafalgar Development Bank in Jamaica and the Institute of
Private Enterprise Development (IPED) in Guyana through which
to channel funds for approved private sector programmes/projects
in a successor agreement.
<P>
There is still space, however, within these proposals to accommodate
the model proposed above.  The idea of creating a private sector
window within the CDB is guided by a number of concerns, namely:
identifying a credible and accountable regional institution which
could act as the umbrella foundation or legitimising body for
a Caribbean private sector window capable of working with a network
of national financial institutions. Within this framework, the
private sector window (the location of which does not have to
be at the present seat of the CDB in Barbados) would operate as
an autonomous entity by virtue of its exclusive role and separate
organizational structure.  The window would also act as a sort
of holding house for private sector funds which would be released
to national institutions once projects have been approved. Under
the current arrangements, Lom&eacute; funds are channeled from
the EU Delegation Office through government to the intermediary
and finally to the beneficiary in the private sector. This is
usually accompanied by delays both on the EU side and on the part
of government, which affect the smooth implementation of the programme.

<P>
In order to minimise the delays, new financing arrangements would
have to be established whereby once projects have been approved
the money is channeled through the designated private sector window
instead of through national governments.  This is assuming that
the Commission can streamline its procedures for monitoring and
implementing  co-operation activities in order to minimise delays
on the EU side.  In this regard, there is much value in the suggestion
that the Commission delegates greater responsibilities to the
Heads of Delegations in the different territories.
<P>
The other difficulty is in ensuring the participation of national
and regional private sector organisations in EDF projects and
programmes and that their initiatives are taken into account in
the formulation and implementation of indicative programmes for
the next five year period.  As pointed out before, the programming
process for the current financial protocol is well underway and
should be completed by November of this year.  The major question
now is how to use the next few months to set the stage for co-operation
over the next five years and beyond.  The remainder of this paper
addresses itself to this question.
<P>
<A NAME="con"><h3><hr>Conclusion and Recommendations</h3></A>
<P>
The previous sections have highlighted a number of key issues
that were the subject of frank and positive discussion between
representatives from the Caribbean private sector and members
of the Development Directorate of the European Commission at the
time of the CCE/CAIC Encounter in Brussels in July this year.
 At the end of the one day Encounter with the European Commission
which brought together some 30 participants from Europe and the
Caribbean, both EC representatives  and Caribbean private sector
participants  had a clearer understanding of what was and was
not possible in the search for a more effective partnership. Importantly,
the list of possibilities outweighed the impossibilities. As a
result, further discussions are intended to see how the very practical
ideas proposed by the private sector organisations present might
be implemented.
<P>
There is no doubt that the private sector will be at the forefront
of most new approaches to development.  Of the three regions of
the ACP, the Caribbean is the most prepared for such a future
approach to co-operation with the European Union. The relative
coherence of the private sector in the region, its vibrancy and
its ability to develop and articulate coherent and unified positions
on which to lobby regional governments are in contrast to the
less developed and more fragmented organisations, particularly
in Sub-Saharan Africa.  
<P>
The effectiveness of this future approach to EU/Caribbean co-operation,
however, will necessitate the development of new financial approaches
aimed at assisting small and medium sized enterprises through
the EIB, the CDI or other instruments such as the ECIP Scheme.
Where the CDI is concerned, there is need for a future increase
in the resources allocated to that institution in a successor
agreement as well as the possible establishment of an envelope
system with set allocations for each region in order to ensure
that each region and territory benefits equitably (if not equally)
from CDI assistance and facilities. New and innovative uses of
EIB resources have also been proposed, including the design of
 policies that have strong impact on the development of financial
markets, enabling financial institutions to provide longer-term
financial resources to small and medium-sized enterprises.  Private
sector-led development also pre-supposes the existence of programmes
to strengthen chambers of commerce, manufacturers associations,
hotel associations and other national  and regional private sector
organisations so as to enable them to provide more effective support
to the business community.  
<P>
The Encounter underlined that there is no substitute for direct
dialogue when seeking to develop a more decentralised approach
to co-operation.   It is a telling statement, however, that once
again, the private sector has had to rely on a non-Lom&eacute;
institution to facilitate effective and direct dialogue with the
European Commission.  This raises the question of whether one
needs to look further than the CCE when searching for a mechanism
to facilitate dialogue with the private sector in the future.
 This is not a role sought by the CCE which sees itself more as
a facilitator and producer of timely information. But in the short
term until proper arrangements are put in place, the CCE remains
a credible body as long as channels are established for forward
and backward exchanges between the different Lom&eacute; partners.
In the longer term, however, unless a basis for direct dialogue
is established there will remain a danger of a competitive situation
developing between national governments and the regional private
sector which might undermine the objectives of co-operation as
well as the principle of partnership that is central to EU/ACP
co-operation. 
<P>
Achieving the objectives of co-operation requires a new culture
of partnership between national governments and their counterparts
in civil society. Despite tentative initiatives towards this kind
of social partnership in a few countries in the region, the required
culture of partnership is still some way off.   In order to give
the process a push start, it will be necessary to create situations
and arrangements that force national governments and decentralised
agents in the private sector to begin working together in the
context of EU/Caribbean co-operation. This comes back to the proposal
to create appropriate mechanisms that incorporate all the Lom&eacute;
partners - national governments, the private sector and the representatives
of civil society - at every stage of EU/Caribbean dialogue; negotiation,
policy development and programming. At the same time, the private
sector will require separate financing windows either through
existing CDI antennae organisations, the EIB or through  the identification
of eligible national financial institutions for the timely delivery
of private sector programmes. 
<P>
The Mid-Term Review having brought about a number of fundamental
changes in the nature of EU/ACP co-operation over the next five
years, no substantial changes can be made to the Convention at
this time.  This, however, does not preclude putting in place
arrangements on a regional level that agree with the letter of
the Convention and which can carry over into a successor agreement.
 This calls for action in the short term to carry forward the
process of dialogue that has been initiated.  As a first priority,
emphasis should be placed on ensuring that some of the projects
identified by individual private sector organisations are incorporated
in the NIPs and the RIP for financing under the current EDF. 
In a number of cases, these proposals need fine-tuning and elaboration.
 The ideas contained in these proposals, however, address the
main constraints to private sector development in the region and
can be built into successful private sector programmes over the
next five years.  In this regard, particular emphasis should be
placed on, but not limited to, programmes aimed at developing
entrepreneurial skills and institutional strengthening within
national and regional private sector organisations. In this way,
the next five years can be used to prepare the Caribbean private
sector to play a more active role in the future delivery of co-operation
programmes and projects and create the conditions for private
sector-led development within the region.
<P>
For their part, individual private sector organisations will have
to begin to work out the practical issues of their respective
proposals as long as they relate to implementation, financing,
etc. with a view to formally submitting them to their respective
NAOs for possible incorporation in the NIP before the completion
of the current programming process.  It is also advisable that
they begin to familiarise themselves with the working of the Convention
by drawing on the experience of those private sector organisations
and governmental agencies that have acted as executing agencies
for past and current EDF projects. 
<P>
It is also up to the CAIC to begin to use its growing dialogue
with CARICOM to lobby the Caricom Secretary General (who is also
the CARIFORUM Secretary General and the Regional Authorising Officer
for the Caribbean Regional Indicative Programme) on the matter
of extending CARIFORUM membership to regional private sector bodies
as well as considering some of the projects identified by regional
private sector associations for financing under the CRIP. With
regard to CARIFORUM membership, the process could begin by admitting
regional private sector bodies as observers at its meetings as
allowed under Rule 7 (2) of the Rules of  Procedure, with a view
to revising the rules and gradually extending membership to decentralised
partners in the Caribbean.   Failing this, there will be the need
to create a makeshift forum in the short term to facilitate regional
dialogue. In which case, this will create an additional call on
regional co-operation funds. In the medium to long term, the growing
emphasis on regional co-operation as a major objective of EU/Caribbean
co-operation will demand serious consideration on the part of
all the parties concerned about how to use existing regional structures
to promote workable partnerships and effective co-operation for
mutual development. 
<P>
For its part, the European Commission will shortly be publishing
its Green Paper outlining the principles of future co-operation
with the countries of the ACP in the next millennium. As the process
of  planning and creative thinking  gains momentum over the next
five years, it will be vital that the mechanics of translating
the principle of decentralised co-operation into a workable practice
are achieved.  A central component will be the incorporation of
the thinking of the Caribbean private sector as reflected in this
paper into ideas being developed separately by the EC and ACP
Ambassadors in Brussels.  
<P>
In this regard, special note should be taken of areas highlighted
in previous sections that indicate the a number of  essential
first steps. These are:
<ul>
<li>Identify existing or new mechanisms to facilitate
direct dialogue between the EU, regional governments and decentralised
agents in the business sector and the rest of civil society</I>:<I>
The past 20 years of government-to-government relationships
necessitated the development of arrangements and institutions
whose membership reflected the interests of the main actors. 
The growing emphasis on decentralised co-operation since 1989,
but the absence of significant private sector programmes delivered
by the private sector shows the inadequacy of existing arrangements.
It also points to the need to facilitate new forms of dialogue
that ensure that the views of decentralised partners are taken
into account in the formulation and the implementation of indicative
programmes.  A  decentralised approach to co-operation in the
future will demand the restructuring of existing mechanisms or
the identification of new ones to reflect the new emphasis on
partnership.
<P>
<I><li>Identify new intermediaries in the private sector
to deliver programmes for the private sector</I>: Private sector
organisations will need to be strengthened institutionally and
become familiarised with the mechanics of the Convention  in order
to ensure their efficiency as intermediaries. This is an essential
part of the new emphasis on  partnership which extends outwards
from the traditional Lom&eacute; partners.  Such an approach represents
a new and more efficient division of labour with the State continuing
to play a central role in the development and implementation of
programmes and projects in such areas as health, education, infrastructure,
civil service reform and fiscal and monetary reform. 
<P>
<li>Identify new financial instruments through which
the EU can give direct support to the Caribbean private sector</I>:
In the same way that the EU has fashioned financial instruments
 to support the private sector in the developing countries of
Asia, Latin America, the Mediterranean and South Africa,  consideration
should be given to how these can be adapted to meet the specific
financing needs of the Caribbean private sector.  In this regard,
the paper has suggested extending to the Caribbean private sector,
some aspects of the European Community Investment Partnership
(ECIP) scheme, which is available to most ALAMEDSA countries but
not to the ACP.   Besides the provision of capital requirements
to set up joint ventures to boost the growth of SMEs, the initiative
to set up European Desks in individual Chambers of Commerce  would
be of particular interest to the Caribbean private sector. 
<P>
</ul>
As the process of creative thinking continues both within the
European Commission and Cariforum countries, we believe that the
joint CCE/CAIC report focus on the approaches necessary to create
an effective partnership after the year 2000.

The following paper is the outcome of a process of consultation carried out on behalf of the Caribbean Council for Europe (CCE) and the Caribbean Association of Industry and Commerce (CAIC) to develop a consensus among member and non-member private sector organisations throughout the Caribbean about the general goals of the Caribbean private sector to highlight the development needs of different private sector entities in the region in the context of European policy towards the Caribbean in the second part of Lom&#233; IV and in a successor agreement after the year 2000. 
<p>
Based on the oft stated belief in Europe and the Caribbean that the private sector is the motor for future regional development, it seeks to:
<UL>
<LI>sensitise the European Union (EU) and the European Commission (EC) to the particular needs of the Caribbean private sector if it is to play a central role in the deelopment process;
<LI>alert Caribbean governments and regional institutions to the need to develop new approaches within national indicative and regional indicative programmes in the second part of Lom&#233; IV;
<LI>make a case for a successor agrement to Lom&#233; IV after the year 2000 that contains a new window free from historic constraints for the private setor and other social partners;
<LI>develop a debate on the private sector&#146;s belief that there is a need for a new intermediary body able to administer in a timely and effective manner aid programmes for the private sector and other social partners;
<LI>develop programmes that support identified programmes ranging from institutions building to support for key industrial and service sectors in the Caribbean; and
<LI>indicate the special role that the French DOM in the region might have in this process as "Europe in the Caribbean."
</UL>

<p>
Despite some tentative steps towards the private sector in the first half of Lom&#233; IV, Caribbean ACP governments and the European Commission have not yet demonstrated their full commitment to the principle of decentralised co-operation and private sector-led development either through making available  funding for the private sector in a timely manner or through the creation of appropriate intermediary bodies to develop private sector programmes. The problem, as underlined by this paper, is that while the Convention places importance on the principle of decentralised co-operation and private sector-led development, in practice the Lom&#233; mechanism continues to operate as a government-to-government agreement with the social partners in the private sector having a severely limited window of  access.  
<p>
In putting forward recommendations for a more effective partnership between the Caribbean and the EU which places the private sector at the centre of that relationship, the paper identifies a number of essential first steps that need to be accomplished. These include identifying new mechanisms to facilitate direct dialogue with the private sector as well as the creation of new intermediaries to deliver private sector programmes; the establishment of effective private sector windows for EU assistance; and new financial instruments to provide direct support to the private sector. 
<p>
<A HREF="ccelowe.htm#1">Section One</A> restates the need for a new strategic alliance between Caribbean governments and the private sector and the adoption of a joint approach to Europe. Increasingly, with the globalisation of world trade and the new imperative to survive on the basis of international competitiveness rather than preferential treatment, the private sector will play a key role in enabling the region to attain sustainable development within the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas. The role of the private sector will also become critical as bilateral and multilateral  aid flows diminish and both regional and international investment  become the principal source of capital accumulation.  At the same time, the relative inexperience of the private sector in dealing with international development agencies suggests the need for a new inter-relationship with government and a joint approach  to Europe.
<p>
<A HREF="ccelowe.htm#2">Section Two</A> assesses the specific needs of the Caribbean private sector.   In focusing on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the private sector, the paper notes that, as a group, the Caribbean private sector is at a higher level of development than its counterparts in most other ACP countries, specifically as it relates to group coherence, vibrancy  and the ability to formulate common positions on which to lobby regional governments. Some common weaknesses also exist across territories. These include a relative lack of technical expertise in national institutions, a lack of entrepreneurial skills in certain territories, a lack of access to long-term financing, the existence of weak private sector institutions and a poor physical and regulatory environment for private sector development.
<p>
To remedy these, there is a role for the EU in the development of schemes and programmes to assist entrepreneurs to keep abreast of technological and demand changes in export markets as well as provide assistance in product and packaging design.  Special emphasis has also been placed on the development of new financial mechanisms that expand the role of the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Centre for the Development of Industry (CDI) and  adapt mechanisms such as the European Community Investment Partnership Scheme (ECIP) to the needs of the Caribbean private sector.
<p>
National and regional private sector  institutions (chambers of commerce, manufacturers associations and hotel associations) also share a common need for institutional strengthening.  Proposals from a number of national private sector organisations call for programmes aimed at capacity building among staff to improve administrative efficiency and technical expertise  and improve communication links across national and regional organisations to facilitate the development of a network of private sector organisations through which information can be disseminated and through which organisations can share the benefit of expertise and research in different areas.
<p>
<A HREF="ccelowe.htm#3">Section Three</A> explores possible new approaches to dialogue and future co-operation between the EU and the Caribbean which facilitate greater private sector involvement in the delivery and implementation of private sector programmes.  Preliminary proposals explore the possibility of using the existing CARIFORUM mechanism as a forum to facilitate ongoing exchanges between regional governments, the private sector and the European Commission in the short term.  While acknowledging that this may be resisted by Caribbean ACP Ministers, the paper notes that failing this, there will be need to establish a new mechanism which will create an additional call on regional co-operation funds.
<p>
Finally, in exploring possible new approaches to financing and programming, the paper underlines the need to devise new arrangements which will increase private sector access to Lom&#233; resources and minimise the bureaucratic delays both on the ACP and EC side without appearing to undermine the recognised right of ACP States to determine their development strategies and models in all sovereignty.  After some discussion of this issue at the time of the CCE/CAIC/EC Encounter in Brussels in July this year, it was agreed that the important thing was to identify eligible and credible financial institutions capable of working with the private sector for the timely delivery of private sector programmes.

Le syst&egrave;me fran&ccedil;ais de coop&eacute;ration, et l'usage
des quelque 47 milliards (en 1994) de l'Aide Publique au D&eacute;veloppement
(APD) donnent lieu &agrave; de vives critiques : tr&egrave;s faible
efficacit&eacute;, voire effets pervers. Les populations &quot;b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires&quot;,
relay&eacute;es par les Organisations de Solidarit&eacute; Internationale
(OSI) lui reprochent de conforter les pouvoirs autoritaires, les
circuits de pillage et les habitudes de corruption ; les rapports
se succ&egrave;dent pour d&eacute;noncer un dispositif dont l'obscurit&eacute;
et la complexit&eacute; renforcent les contradictions.
<P>
De trop fortes tutelles g&eacute;opolitique et financi&egrave;re,
et en particulier la pratique, exceptionnelle pour un pays d&eacute;mocratique,
du &quot;domaine r&eacute;serv&eacute;&quot;, marginalisent et
st&eacute;rilisent le d&eacute;bat sur les relations entre la
France et les pays du Sud. Celles-ci sont pourtant d&eacute;terminantes
: aucun des principaux probl&egrave;mes qui pr&eacute;occupent
les Fran&ccedil;ais ne peut plus &ecirc;tre r&eacute;solu sans
prendre en compte l'&eacute;volution et le potentiel d'une part
croissante de l'humanit&eacute; : l'attitude de la France vis-&agrave;-vis
des peuples du Sud (notamment des plus proches, ceux d'Afrique),
l'image qu'elle se fa&ccedil;onnne aupr&egrave;s d'eux, sont d&eacute;cisives
pour son avenir &eacute;conomique, politique et culturel. Et le
projet d'Union europ&eacute;enne ne pourra se dispenser d'une
perspective neuve de relations avec les grandes r&eacute;gions
du tiers monde.
<P>
La soci&eacute;t&eacute; fran&ccedil;aise, ses citoyens qui tissent
des r&eacute;seaux de comp&eacute;tences et de convictions, ses
contribuables qui acquittent un &quot;imp&ocirc;t de solidarit&eacute;&quot;,
ne peuvent se satisfaire de ces graves d&eacute;faillances. Ils
se doivent de tenter de rem&eacute;dier &agrave; un profond d&eacute;ficit
du d&eacute;bat politique et m&eacute;thodologique sur les objectifs,
les institutions, les pratiques et les r&eacute;sultats de l'APD
fran&ccedil;aise. 
<P>
La vocation de l'Observatoire se veut avant tout citoyenne. Il s'agit d'interpeller 
le pouvoir politique et l'opinion publique sur les grandes problématiques de la 
coopération française. 
<P>
L'Observatoire permanent de la coop&eacute;ration fran&ccedil;aise
(OPCF) regroupe aujourd'hui une cinquantaine de personnalit&eacute;s
venant d'horizons divers de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile (universitaires,
chercheurs, membres d'organisations de solidarit&eacute; internationale,
experts, coop&eacute;rants, journalistes...) concern&eacute;es
&agrave; la fois sur un plan professionnel et en tant que citoyens
par la politique fran&ccedil;aise de coop&eacute;ration.
<P>
Il est bien entendu possible &agrave; tous les repr&eacute;sentants
qualifi&eacute;s de la &quot;soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile&quot;,
qui adh&eacute;reraient &agrave; la pr&eacute;sente Charte et
souhaiteraient contribuer &agrave; son application, de rejoindre
cet Observatoire. Celui-ci a le statut d'une association ind&eacute;pendante,
ce dont se porte le coll&egrave;ge de ses membres fondateurs.
<P>
Son titre parle de coop&eacute;ration plut&ocirc;t que d'aide
car, dans l'esprit de ses fondateurs, construire ensemble un monde
vivable pour tous ne rel&egrave;ve pas de l'assistance, mais de
l'indispensable &eacute;change et de la promotion d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts
mutuels. Mais les modes d'exercice de cette coop&eacute;ration
restent largement &agrave; r&eacute;inventer pour devenir cr&eacute;dibles,
et s'adapter aux mutations du monde.
<P>
L'Observatoire permanent de la coop&eacute;ration fran&ccedil;aise
entreprend des &eacute;tudes, publie des rapports et ouvrages,
organise des d&eacute;bats, et lance toutes interpellations
susceptibles de favoriser l'&eacute;mergence de cette coop&eacute;ration
renouvel&eacute;e. Il cherche notamment, &agrave; travers un
rapport annuel, &agrave; fournir des analyses, des &eacute;valuations,
des diagnostics et des recommendations, sur tel ou tel secteur,
telle out telle r&eacute;gion b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire de la
coop&eacute;ration fran&ccedil;aise.  Ce faisant, il s'attache &agrave;
concilier les exigences de la rigueur scientifique avec les n&eacute;cessit&eacute;s
de la communication des r&eacute;sultats de ses recherches.

<html><head><title>Poland: Catholic backlash </title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><img align=left hspace=3 src="ippf_pix/ippf_logo.gif"><h3>International<br>Planned<br>Parenthood<br>Federation</h3><i>The material that follows has been provided by <a href="ippf_info.html">IPPF</a></i><br clear=left><hr><h1>Poland: Catholic backlash</h1><b>by Wanda Novicka</b><p>There have been a lot of changes in Poland since 1989 when communism finally collapsed.  The transition has affected all segments of the society at all levels of public and private life, but women's reproductive rights have been particularly affected.<p>When in the late 1980s some anti-choice forces started challenging legal abortion nobody believed that the abortion law could ever be overturned. It finally happened, though, in 1993 and seems to be lasting, although society, frightened by right-wing forces and their performance, have returned to the post-communists, electing them again to Parliament in 1992 for the first time in free elections.<p>It is certain that the post-communists will not meet the expectations of those who voted for them that they will oppose the right-wing forces supported strongly by the Roman Catholic Church. On the contrary, post-communists busy with strengthening their newly regained political and economic acquisitions will allow right-wing forces to strengthen their gains in social matters, particularly those which concern women and the youth.<p>Among these gains was Roman-Catholic influence on education at state schools since 1990 which goes much further than just religious teaching, and of course restrictions to abortion, which had been legal in Poland since 1956.  The anti-abortion law has already resulted in tragedies for women and their families and doctors.  Women are forced to make difficult choices either to seek illegal and sometimes unsafe abortion or to give birth to an unwanted child.  Women with serious health problems are forced to have a baby, and even those who have the right to legal abortion under the present law are often denied it.<p>There have been suicides resulting from unwanted pregnancy or from performing illegal abortion: a woman gynaecologist who performed an abortion in 1994 had to take the woman patient to hospital because problems had arisen, and then committed suicide because she expected criminal charges to be brought against her. Several women committed suicide as a result of unwanted pregnancy.<p>But this law has unexpectedly had some tragicomic effects such as the serious threat of closing a private clinic performing in vitro fertilization.  The need to freeze embryos resulted in a statement made by a Commission of Medical Ethics that it violates the anti-abortion law (officially called the Law on family planning, protection of the human embryo and conditions of admittance of abortion), and an investigation is in process. And the head of a school board issued a rule that embryos and other anatomical specimens cannot serve as educational models in schools, because they also violate the anti-abortion law.<p>As for young people, they are exposed to strange school textbooks on sexual education.  In one such book sexuality is described in symbolic language.  A girl is called "a closed garden, a sealed source".  The source will be unsealed after marriage.  In one chapter, "The secret of a girl and a boy", the names of human sexual organs are not mentioned, but described like this: "The source of life of a woman is located in lower part of her body, inside the body (...).  The source of life of a man is partially outside".  This is how sex education is taught by those teachers who have chosen this manual distributed by the Ministry of Education.<p>Family planning, which has never been popular in Catholic Poland, has been becoming an object of moral dilemma in the society. But it is not surprising in a country where there are doctors who instead of prescribing contraception make lectures to their patients on the Roman Catholic Church teaching on contraception and try to convince women that contraception is the same as abortion.  Some books on women's health only mention natural methods in chapters on family planning.<p>I hope that one day I will be laughing at such stupidities and other ones as the hangover from the never-returning past.  But for the time being these prospects are very distant.<p><hr width=60%><i>Wanda Nowicka is Executive Director of the Polish Federation for Women and Family Planning.</i><p> <hr><p>©Copyright IPPF 1995.<hr><img src="ippf_pix/ippf_logo2.gif"> <a href="index.html">IPPF Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

<h3>Apr&#232;s le Sommet de la Terre: mise en application du d&#233;veloppement durable<p>L'aide de la C.E. et le d&#233;veloppement durable: Note d'information No. 2, 1995</h3>



<I>En juin 1992, lors du Sommet de la Terre de Rio de Janeiro, les gouvernements du monde entier se sont engag&#233;s &#224; mettre sur pied un nouveau partenariat mondial pour un d&#233;veloppement durable. Ce partenariat repose sur un axiome - admettre la n&#233;cessaire augmentation de la quantit&#233; comme de la qualit&#233; de l&#146;aide aux pays du Sud. M&#234;me si, depuis Rio, les flux d&#146;aide ont en fait diminu&#233;, les donateurs ont adopt&#233; un certain nombre de mesures d&#146;am&#233;lioration de la qualit&#233; &#233;cologique de leurs programmes de coop&#233;ration.</i>
<p>
Dans la foul&#233;e de la <A HREF="bp1_fr.html">Note d&#146;Information No 1</A>, consacr&#233;e &#224; la th&#233;orie du d&#233;veloppement durable, ce texte aborde les d&#233;fis de l&#146;apr&#232;s-Rio tels que les rencontrent commun&#233;ment les organismes donateurs et explique de quelle fa&#231;on les donateurs europ&#233;ens int&#232;grent le d&#233;veloppement durable &#224; leurs op&#233;rations d&#146;aide au d&#233;veloppement</I>. 
<p>
Le besoin d&#146;une aide au d&#233;veloppement accrue et de meilleure qualit&#233; est un des th&#232;mes fondamentaux d&#146;Action 21, le plan pour un d&#233;veloppement durable adopt&#233; au Sommet de Rio. Action 21 estime m&#234;me qu&#146;un montant annuel de 125 milliards de dollars de financement pr&#233;f&#233;rentiel est requis pour aider le Sud a orienter son itin&#233;raire de d&#233;velop-pement vers la durabilit&#233;. Depuis Rio, h&#233;las, la r&#233;cession &#233;conomique et les priorit&#233;s nouvelles de l&#146;apr&#232;s guerre froide ont entra&#238;n&#233; une chute r&#233;elle de l&#146;assistance au d&#233;veloppement du Sud, pass&#233;e de 60,8 mil-liards de dollars en 1992 &#224; 55,9 milliards de dollars en 1993. Telle est la brutale r&#233;alit&#233; qui donne un surcro&#238;t d&#146;importance au besoin de garantir que toute l&#146;aide disponible soit orient&#233;e de mani&#232;re &#224; r&#233;pondre aux besoins des pays partenaires de fa&#231;on &#224; ce que ceux des futures g&#233;n&#233;rations ne soient pas compromis.
<P>
Au niveau politique, les organismes donateurs reconnaissent depuis longtemps l&#146;importance d&#146;une int&#233;gration de l&#146;&#233;cologie &#224; la planification et &#224; l&#146;application de l&#146;aide au d&#233;veloppement et la plupart d&#146;entre eux se servent maintenant de simples proc&#233;dures &#233;cologiques et instruments de gestion de l&#146;environnement. Le Sommet de la Terre est parti de ces fondations pour d&#233;placer l&#146;objectif des politiques de l&#146;environnement et du d&#233;veloppement afin qu&#146;elles ne se contentent plus de r&#233;duire les effets nuisibles des projets d&#146;assistance et tendent plut&#244;t &#224; satisfaire les besoins mat&#233;riels des populations pauvres dans le respect des limites impos&#233;es par la nature. La mise en actes de ce concept plus positif qu&#146;est le d&#233;veloppement durable offre aux organismes donateurs, autant d&#146;opportunit&#233;s que de dilemmes, dont nous traitons ci-apr&#232;s.

<H3>Revenir sur le Sommet de Rio</H3>

La prescription pour un d&#233;veloppement durable est &#224; la fois immense et complexe. Le plan Action 21 comporte 40 chapitres traitant de 100 domaines programmatiques et avan&#231;ant 3000 recommandations, qui portent sur des secteurs-cl&#233;s tels que l&#146;agriculture, l&#146;industrie et la gestion urbaine, ainsi que sur toute une gamme de priorit&#233;s environ-nementales comme la pr&#233;servation de la biodiversit&#233;, le changement du climat, la d&#233;sertification, les d&#233;chets dangereux, les produits chimiques toxiques, l&#146;eau et un ensemble de probl&#232;mes multi-sectoriels: transferts de technologies, pauvret&#233;, d&#233;mographie et commerce. Mais l&#146;on n&#146;a pas fix&#233; de priorit&#233;s ou fourni d&#146;orientations quant aux modalit&#233;s de traduction de ces objectifs g&#233;n&#233;raux en termes op&#233;rationnels. En cons&#233;quence, les donateurs ont d&#251; proc&#233;der &#224; leur propre d&#233;finition des implications de la CNUED.
<P>
En Hollande, le Conseil consultatif national pour le d&#233;veloppement a publi&#233; un texte tr&#232;s complet sur l&#146;orientation de l&#146;aide n&#233;erlandaise en faveur du d&#233;veloppement durable. Sa pierre angulaire est le principe d&#146;&#171;espace environnemental&#187;, qui veut que chaque individu ait un droit &#233;gal &#224; la capacit&#233; de soutien limit&#233;e dont dispose le globe terrestre eu &#233;gard &#224; la satisfaction de ses besoins. Au plan mondial, la politique de d&#233;veloppement doit s&#146;attacher &#224; r&#233;duire les in&#233;galit&#233;s d&#146;acc&#232;s &#224; l&#146;espace environnemental dont souffre le Sud par rapport au Nord, alors que l&#146;aide devrait &#234;tre cibl&#233;e afin d&#146;&#233;liminer les facteurs structurels qui font courir au Sud un plus grand risque de subir des d&#233;g&#226;ts &#233;cologiques: in&#233;galit&#233; dans les droits de propri&#233;t&#233;, dans l&#146;acc&#232;s aux ressources, ainsi qu&#146;entre hommes et femmes dans les prises de d&#233;cision.
<P>
En Su&#232;de, le minist&#232;re des affaires &#233;trang&#232;res a mis sur pied un groupe de travail consacr&#233; &#224; &#171;l&#146;aide durable&#187;, qui a &#233;labor&#233; des principes g&#233;n&#233;raux et des directives sectorielles pour l&#146;am&#233;lioration de la gestion de l&#146;aide. Le rapport de ce groupe de travail rel&#232;ve trois principes-cl&#233;s de cette gestion, issus de l&#146;accord de Rio: l&#146;adoption d&#146;une approche de pr&#233;caution dans la gestion des risques &#233;cologiques; l&#146;assurance d&#146;une compl&#232;te int&#233;gration des co&#251;ts environnementaux &#224; la planification des projets afin que &#171;le pollueur paie&#187;; et l&#146;obligation d&#146;int&#233;grer &#224; tout projet une &#233;tude d&#146;impact &#233;cologique. Ce document souligne aussi l&#146;importance du dialogue &#224; mener en mati&#232;re de politique &#224; suivre avec les pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires, facteur crucial d&#146;une bonne compr&#233;hension de leurs priorit&#233;s de d&#233;veloppement durable.

<H3>Le renforcement de la gestion de l&#146;environnement</H3>

Quand les donateurs parviennent &#224; une r&#233;elle compr&#233;hension des implications de la CNUED, leur attention doit aller aux moyens de renforcer leurs syst&#232;mes de gestion de l&#146;environnement dans le cadre de l&#146;aide au d&#233;veloppement, afin d&#146;&#233;tablir clairement les priorit&#233;s, proc&#233;dures et responsabilit&#233;s n&#233;cessaires &#224; l&#146;int&#233;gration des facteurs &#233;cologiques dans tous les programmes et politiques de d&#233;veloppement.
<P>
Au plan europ&#233;en, la Commission a adopt&#233; en juin 1993 un certain nombre de mesures visant &#224; incorporer l&#146;environnement &#224; toutes ses politiques, conform&#233;ment en cela au trait&#233; d&#146;union europ&#233;enne et au cinqui&#232;me programme d&#146;action environnementale. Chaque direction g&#233;n&#233;rale (DG) doit maintenant proc&#233;der &#224; l&#146;&#233;valuation sous cet angle de chaque politique et projet, d&#232;s la conception, et en estimer chaque ann&#233;e les performances environ-nementales. Au sein de chaque DG, un haut fonctionnaire est charg&#233;, avec l&#146;appui de la direction de l&#146;environnement, d&#146;assurer le bon accomplissement de ces t&#226;ches.
<P>
En octobre 1994, les minist&#232;res fran&#231;ais de l&#146;environnement et du d&#233;veloppement ont sign&#233; un protocole sp&#233;cial de collaboration o&#249; figurent des principes-cl&#233;s, des objectifs fondamentaux et des instruments appropri&#233;s pour une meilleure prise en compte de l&#146;environnement dans la politique de coop&#233;ration de la France. Les deux administrations, par exemple, se sont engag&#233;es &#224; soutenir conjointement des activit&#233;s de promotion et de prise de conscience ainsi que des projets de recherche. Elles sont aussi d&#146;accord pour intensifier la participation &#224; leur travail des ONG et des communaut&#233;s locales.

<H3>L&#146;&#233;valuation des impacts &#233;cologiques</H3>

La CNUED a r&#233;affirm&#233; la place de l&#146;&#233;valuation des impacts &#233;cologiques (EIA), pr&#233;alable garantissant l&#146;application de l&#146;aide au d&#233;veloppement durable &#224; long terme. L&#146;OCDE dispose d&#233;j&#224; de directives pour une bonne pratique de l&#146;EIA et en 1993, la Commission a pr&#233;sent&#233; son propre Manuel sur l&#146;environnement, &#233;tabli &#224; partir de l&#146;exp&#233;rience des &#201;tats-membres et devant servir &#224; guider les d&#233;cideurs, en son sein et dans les pays ACP partenaires, lors de l&#146;int&#233;gration des facteurs environnementaux &#224; chaque &#233;tape du cycle de projet. La participation des populations locales aux EIA est cruciale pour leur r&#233;ussite, car le plus souvent on n&#146;a pas de meilleure source o&#249; obtenir les informations &#233;cologiques.
<P>
En 1994, l&#146;organisme danois d&#146;aide au d&#233;velopppement, DANIDA, a publi&#233; un nouveau manuel d&#146;&#233;valuation &#233;cologique pour le d&#233;veloppement durable (Environmental assessment for sustainable development) afin de garantir que toutes ses activit&#233;s soient con&#231;ues et r&#233;alis&#233;es de mani&#232;re totalement conforme aux r&#232;gles et normes environnementales pertinentes, nationales et internatio-nales. Pour DANIDA, l&#146;&#233;valuation &#233;cologique a un double r&#244;le: en premier lieu, trouver des moyens de pr&#233;venir, mitiger ou compenser les impacts &#233;cologiques nuisibles et, en second lieu, d&#233;terminer les moyens de partir des impacts &#233;cologiques favorables pour mener des actions de promotion, d&#146;am&#233;lioration, de capitalisation.
<P>
Le manuel de DANIDA indique aussi que son propos est &#171;d&#146;am&#233;liorer le d&#233;veloppement et non d&#146;y faire obstacle&#187;, encore qu&#146;il reconnaisse que certains voient en l&#146;&#233;valuation &#233;cologique un outil &#171;anti&#187; d&#233;veloppement ou oppos&#233; &#224; la croissance. Sans &#233;valuation &#233;cologique, on courra toujours le risque de voir un secteur se d&#233;velopper aux d&#233;pens d&#146;un autre ou, en l&#233;guant un lourd fardeau aux g&#233;n&#233;rations futures - le risque, en d&#146;autres termes, que ce d&#233;veloppement ne soit pas durable.

<H3>L&#146;attribution de priorit&#233;s aux investissements</H3>

L&#146;int&#233;gration de l&#146;approche &#233;cologique &#224; tous les aspects du dossier de la coop&#233;ration est condition n&#233;cessaire, mais non suffisante, de la promotion du d&#233;veloppement durable dans les pays partenaires. Il faut aussi faire des investissements explicites dans les domaines &#224; priorit&#233; &#233;cologique afin de r&#233;parer les d&#233;g&#226;ts du pass&#233;, g&#233;rer les ressources actuelles et pr&#233;venir la r&#233;currence des risques.
<P>
Au plan international, on peut assigner aux organismes donateurs cinq priorit&#233;s d&#146;investissement &#233;cologique: la pr&#233;servation de la biodiversit&#233;; la lutte contre la d&#233;sertification, la gestion et la conservation durables des for&#234;ts, la pr&#233;vention du changement climatique et la gestion du commerce des d&#233;chets dangereux et des produits chimiques toxiques. Mais c&#146;est au niveau de chacun des pays du Sud que devront &#234;tre d&#233;finies des priorit&#233;s sp&#233;cifiques, de pr&#233;f&#233;rence par le canal de strat&#233;gies nationales de d&#233;veloppement durable, processus que recommande Action 21. En g&#233;n&#233;ral, les priorit&#233;s nationales de l&#146;apr&#232;s-Rio devraient embrasser des dossiers tels que l&#146;agriculture durable, la conservation et la gestion des eaux, l&#146;efficience et le renouvellement &#233;nerg&#233;tiques, une production industrielle moins polluante, des modes de transport durables, la sant&#233; et l&#146;environnement dans les villes et la gestion des zones littorales.
<P>
Eu &#233;gard aux priorit&#233;s &#233;cologiques internationales, le r&#244;le d&#146;investisseur principal a &#233;t&#233; attribu&#233; au Fond pour l&#146;Environnement Mondial (FEM), &#233;tabli en 1991 et cog&#233;r&#233; par la Banque Mondiale, le PNUD et le PNUE. Le FEM offre un m&#233;canisme de financement multilat&#233;ral pour la mise en application des accords de Rio dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement et vient d&#146;&#234;tre l&#146;objet d&#146;une restructuration, avec 2 milliards de dollars pour financer des projets dans quatre domaines prioritaires: la biodiversit&#233;, le changement climatique, les eaux internationales et l&#146;amincissement de la couche d&#146;ozone.
<P>
Par ailleurs, les donateurs ont proc&#233;d&#233;, avec Rio &#224; l&#146;esprit, &#224; la r&#233;vision de leurs priorit&#233;s d&#146;investissement &#233;cologique dans leurs activit&#233;s bilat&#233;rales. Le minist&#232;re fran&#231;ais de la coop&#233;ration a r&#233;dig&#233; un plan d&#146;action pour l&#146;environnement qui insiste sur l&#146;importance d&#146;une am&#233;lioration des capacit&#233;s environnementales par la formation et la prise de conscience, gr&#226;ce aussi &#224; des activit&#233;s sp&#233;cifiques de gestion des zones littorales, des domaines prot&#233;g&#233;s et des for&#234;ts tropicales. La coop&#233;ration fran&#231;aise en Afrique veut aussi lutter contre la d&#233;sertification, s&#146;attaquer aux d&#233;chets urbains, g&#233;rer l&#146;eau dans les zones rurales et urbaines et pr&#233;server la diversit&#233; biologique. L&#146;agence britannique de d&#233;veloppement outre-mer (ODA) a &#233;labor&#233; des strat&#233;gies correspondant &#224; chacune de ses quatre priorit&#233;s &#233;cologiques d&#233;finies apr&#232;s Rio: efficience &#233;nerg&#233;tique, gestion des for&#234;ts, biodiversit&#233; et agriculture durable. Ainsi, par exemple, sa strat&#233;gie pour l&#146;&#233;nergie d&#233;note un passage du financement de nouvelles capacit&#233;s de production &#233;nerg&#233;tique vers un soutien &#224; une production et une utilisation plus efficaces de l&#146;&#233;nergie.

<H3>La mesure des flux d&#146;aide au d&#233;veloppement durable</H3>

Nous avons besoin d&#146;informations statistiques pr&#233;cises et exactes sur les flux d&#146;aide afin d&#146;en &#233;valuer les performances au regard des priorit&#233;s politiques. La d&#233;finition de ce qui est &#171;&#233;cologique&#187; ou &#171;environnemental&#187; peut cependant poser probl&#232;me, car de nombreux projets d&#146;assistance comportent des objectifs sociaux, &#233;conomiques et &#233;cologiques. La CE classe les projets &#233;cologiques en quatre cat&#233;gories, selon la proportion de leur budget allou&#233;e aux objectifs &#233;cologiques (soit, avant tout, le d&#233;veloppement rural int&#233;gr&#233;, la gestion des eaux, l&#146;&#233;ducation &#233;cologique, la biodiversit&#233; et les projets forestiers). La France, quant &#224; elle, a retenu cinq postes principaux de d&#233;penses &#233;cologiques: la sant&#233;, l&#146;eau, le d&#233;veloppement rural et les ressources naturelles, l&#146;urbanisme, l&#146;industrie et la communication ainsi que l&#146;&#233;nergie, qui repr&#233;sentent 15 % de l&#146;aide accord&#233;e en 1993 par le minist&#232;re fran&#231;ais de la coop&#233;ration.
<P>
Pour la coop&#233;ration allemande au d&#233;veloppement, la d&#233;finition de ce qui est &#233;cologique se limite aux projets dont les objectifs sont consacr&#233;s, de mani&#232;re pr&#233;dominante et directe, &#224; la protection de l&#146;environnement humain et des ressources naturelles. Les projets &#233;cologiques doivent donc traiter de la gestion durable des ressources, de la lutte contre la d&#233;sertification, de la r&#233;duction de la consommation de bois de chauffe et de l&#146;&#233;limination des effluents, mais non de la promotion d&#146;une augmentation de la production agricole, ou de la fourniture d&#146;amen&#233;es d&#146;eau potable, ou encore de la protection int&#233;gr&#233;e des v&#233;g&#233;taux. De 1990 &#224; 1993, les projets &#233;cologiques ont  repr&#233;sent&#233; de 20 &#224; 25 % de l&#146;aide allemande.

<H3>Le d&#233;veloppement des capacit&#233;s &#233;cologiques</H3>

L&#146;adoption pratique de priorit&#233;s &#233;cologiques dans l&#146;h&#233;misph&#232;re sud repose sur la disponibilit&#233;, dans les pays partenaires, de capacit&#233;s humaines, technologiques et institutionnelles dans les secteurs public, priv&#233; et associatif. L&#146;OCDE vient tout juste d&#146;adopter des lignes directrices pour le d&#233;veloppement des capacit&#233;s dans le domaine de l&#146;environnement (DCE), lignes directrices qui pr&#233;cisent le r&#244;le d&#146;appui limit&#233; que peuvent jouer les donateurs quant au renforcement de ces capacit&#233;s: &#171;seuls ceux pour qui l&#146;environnement repr&#233;sente un enjeu direct dans des circonstances donn&#233;es peuvent donner aux processus un caract&#232;re durable&#187;, d&#233;clare l&#146;organisation.
<P>
Les donateurs peuvent apporter leur assistance financi&#232;re &#224; toute une gamme d&#146;activit&#233;s: &#233;ducation et prise de conscience du public, formation &#224; la gestion &#233;cologique d&#146;entreprise, soutien aux institutions &#224; base communautaire et conseil en mati&#232;re d&#146;&#233;laboration et d&#146;application de politiques de l&#146;environnement. Les ONG peuvent souvent avoir un r&#244;le d&#146;impulsion du d&#233;veloppement de capacit&#233;s puisqu&#146;elles peuvent toucher des sections de la population dont la participation serait, sans elles, peu probable. Elle peuvent aussi am&#233;liorer les connaissances disponibles et influencer les attitudes, engendrer l&#146;acceptation, au niveau politique, d&#146;une r&#233;flexion &#224; long terme et offrir des exemples d&#146;alternatives concr&#232;tes.
<P>
Les efforts de l&#146;Allemagne en mati&#232;re de d&#233;veloppement de capacit&#233;s passent par la fondation allemande pour le d&#233;veloppement international (DSE) et par l&#146;association Carl Duisberg. La DSE se charge d&#146;actions de formation pour les fonctionnaires gouvernementaux et ONG du Sud, se concentrant sur le droit de l&#146;environnement et sur les ins-truments &#233;conomiques appliqu&#233;s &#224; ce domaine, sur les techniques de gestion de l&#146;environnement (y compris la pr&#233;vention des conflits), ainsi que sur la planification et la surveillance environnementales. L&#146;association Carl Duisberg, soutenue parle monde des affaires et de l&#146;&#146;industrie d&#146;Allemagne, a pris l&#146;initiative d&#146;un nouveau programme de formation &#224; la qualit&#233; de l&#146;eau et a donn&#233; un r&#244;le tout sp&#233;cial &#224; l&#146;enseignement de la gestion de l&#146;environnement dans le secteur industriel.

<H3>L&#146;adoption d&#146;une approche plus participative</H3>

Action 21 insiste sur la participation des communaut&#233;s locales, condition pr&#233;alable du d&#233;veloppement durable. C&#146;est cette participation qui permet d&#146;obtenir une durabilit&#233; &#224; long terme car elle d&#233;bouche sur des projets mieux aptes &#224; satisfaire les besoins des b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires et capables de s&#146;int&#233;grer &#224; leurs normes culturelles. Par ailleurs, elle donne aux populations locales un sentiment plus profond de prise en main des projets. Les constatations empiriques dont on dispose semblent indiquer que la voie qui m&#232;ne &#224; une revitalisation &#233;conomique et &#233;cologique passe par l&#146;appr&#233;ciation &#224; leur juste valeur des id&#233;es et connaissances de la population, gr&#226;ce &#224; sa participation active &#224; la planification et &#224; la r&#233;alisation des projets.
<P>
Depuis Rio, les donateurs orientent de plus en plus leurs investissements vers des initiatives participatives et &#224; base communautaire. La transition des programmes de la CE vers une approche plus d&#233;mocratique (de la base au sommet) a d&#146;ores et d&#233;j&#224; d&#233;but&#233; avec l&#146;introduction de &#171;l&#146;approche int&#233;gr&#233;e et cadre logique&#187; et avec la promotion d&#146;une coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e. Plus de la moiti&#233; des directives de programmation &#233;tablies pour Lom&#233; bis insistent sur le besoin de participation, surtout en mati&#232;re d&#146;environ-nement, de d&#233;veloppement durable et d&#146;analyse sociale, d&#146;actions en faveur des femmes, de gestion des eaux, de foresterie, de d&#233;veloppement urbain et aussi pour le secteur priv&#233;, pour l&#146;emploi, les p&#234;cheries et le tourisme. L&#146;ODA britannique a adopt&#233; des directives op&#233;rationnelles quant &#224; la participation et fait usage de techniques participatives dans le cadre de certains projets. Elle tente de faire &#233;voluer l&#146;ensemble de sa culture en mati&#232;re de d&#233;veloppement, en adoptant une m&#233;thode de travail participative dite &#171;m&#233;thodologie de la formation d&#146;&#233;quipes&#187;, laquelle permet de formuler les projets et d&#146;identifier les parties prenantes gr&#226;ce &#224; une ample participation interne.
<P>
Mais seul un petit nombre de donateurs, comme la Banque Mondiale, font d&#233;j&#224; le bilan de leur exp&#233;rience &#224; l&#146;aide de techniques participatives. Au sein de la Banque, un groupe informel d&#146;apprentissage consacr&#233; au d&#233;veloppement participatif s&#146;est livr&#233; &#224; l&#146;&#233;valuation des progr&#232;s, d&#233;couvrant qu&#146;un bon nombre de projets cat&#233;goris&#233;s comme &#171;participatifs&#187; n&#146;impliquaient pas vraiment les populations locales et remarquant que si la participation entra&#238;ne une augmentation des frais de d&#233;part, plus pr&#233;cis&#233;ment &#224; cause d&#146;un nombre accru d&#146;heures r&#233;mun&#233;r&#233;es, cela est plus que contrebalanc&#233; par les avantages qui en d&#233;coulent. La Banque dispose d&#233;sormais d&#146;un guide de ressources pour la participation, dont les informations portent sur diff&#233;rents secteurs et elle consid&#232;re maintenant de quelle mani&#232;re elle peut en d&#233;river une proc&#233;dure standard.

<H3>Rendre compte des performances environnementales</H3>

Un th&#232;me fondamental parcourt les accords auxquels a abouti le sommet plan&#233;taire: il s&#146;agit de la n&#233;cessit&#233; d&#146;une implication plus pouss&#233;e du public &#224; l&#146;&#233;laboration des politiques d&#146;ordre local, national et international. Au sein du syst&#232;me des Nations unies, une nouvelle entit&#233;, la Commission pour le d&#233;veloppement durable (CDD) a &#233;t&#233; cr&#233;&#233;e pour suivre l&#146;application des accords de Rio. &#192; ce jour, elle s&#146;est r&#233;unie trois fois, autant d&#146;occasions saisies par les gouvernements (dont la plupart des &#201;tats-membre de l&#146;UE) pour rendre compte de leurs performances. Une r&#233;vision compl&#232;te d&#146;Action 21 aura lieu en 1997. Au plan national, plusieurs &#201;tat-membres de l&#146;UE ont &#233;tabli des m&#233;canismes consultatifs - tables-rondes ou commissions nationales - afin de pr&#233;server le mouvement lanc&#233; &#224; Rio en faisant se rencontrer les groupes nombreux et divers pour qui le d&#233;veloppement durable a des enjeux (comme par ex. les fonctionnaires gouvernementaux, les politiciens, diff&#233;rents groupes du monde des affaires et du travail, l&#146;universit&#233; et les ONG). Au plan europ&#233;en, le Forum consultatif sur l&#146;environnement a &#233;t&#233; fond&#233;, mais il n&#146;a pas encore accord&#233; son attention aux politiques de coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement.
<P>
Les comptes rendus publics des performances environnementales, en pleine augmentation, ont un r&#244;le tout aussi important en tant que m&#233;canisme de retour d&#146;information que comme stimulant des processus d&#146;am&#233;lioration. En ce qui les concerne, la Banque Mondiale a pris une position pionni&#232;re, produisant d&#232;s 1990 son premier rapport annuel sur l&#146;environnement. Le dernier paru traite de l&#146;ann&#233;e fiscale 1994: avec plus de 250 pages, Rendre le d&#233;veloppement durable donne une image compl&#232;te des politiques et activit&#233;s de la Banque en mati&#232;re d&#146;environnement, les le&#231;ons tir&#233;es et performances r&#233;alis&#233;es. En compl&#233;ment de ce rapport, la Banque a adopt&#233; une nouvelle politique de communication permettant au public d&#146;acc&#233;der &#224; des informations sommaires sur les aspects &#233;cologiques de ses projets et passant m&#234;me par Internet: en juin 1994 d&#233;j&#224;, la Banque recevait sur Internet, chaque semaine, pr&#232;s de 3000 demandes d&#146;information &#224; ce sujet.
<P>
Certains donateurs europ&#233;ens ont publi&#233; des documents voulant faire prendre conscience, par le public, de l&#146;existence et du contenu des accords de Rio. L&#146;administration g&#233;n&#233;rale belge de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement a sorti Entre l&#146;apocalypse et l&#146;utopie, brochure destin&#233;e aux jeunes et exposant les grands th&#232;mes d&#146;Action 21, tandis que la Documentation Fran&#231;aise a &#233;dit&#233; La plan&#232;te Terre entre nos mains, utile manuel r&#233;sumant les cons&#233;quences majeures de Rio pour la soci&#233;t&#233; civile.

<H3>Concevoir des accords d&#146;aide novateurs</H3>

Il faudra du temps pour obtenir l&#146;assurance que les programmes d&#146;aide de type courant contribuent au d&#233;veloppement durable. Il faut, en outre, que les donateurs envisagent de nouveaux mod&#232;les de coop&#233;ration, o&#249; l&#146;exp&#233;rimentation et l&#146;innovation aient leur place. C&#146;est peut-&#234;tre la Hollande qui est all&#233;e le plus loin en ce sens, avec les accords bilat&#233;raux de d&#233;veloppement durable qu&#146;elle a pass&#233;s avec les gouvernements du Bhoutan, du B&#233;nin et du Costa Rica. Ces accords ont &#233;t&#233; con&#231;us dans une optique de rupture avec l&#146;approche traditionnelle et les principes qui les animent sont la r&#233;ciprocit&#233;, l&#146;&#233;quit&#233; et la participation. Ils donnent en cons&#233;quence une place aussi bonne aux r&#233;formes des politiques int&#233;rieures hollandaises qu&#146;au soutien des initiatives du Sud. L&#146;accord avec le B&#233;nin, par exemple, porte sur l&#146;exportation vers la Hollande d&#146;un coton &#171;propre&#187; et sur les modalit&#233;s de compensation dont b&#233;n&#233;ficiera ce pays en vertu des surco&#251;ts engendr&#233;s par une production cotonni&#232;re plus durable.
<P>
Si on les consid&#232;re dans leur ensemble, ces huit priorit&#233;s de l&#146;apr&#232;s Rio, qui animent d&#233;sormais les donateurs, consti-tuent une modification substantielle d&#146;attitudes jusqu&#146;alors impavides quant &#224; la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. Mais on doit &#233;viter d&#146;y voir des fardeaux ou contraintes suppl&#233;mentaires pesant sur la gestion de l&#146;aide. Bien au contraire, elles sont autant de mani&#232;res de rendre l&#146;aide plus efficace en lui donnant le long terme pour horizon.

<I>En juin 1992, lors du sommet plan&#233;taire de Rio de Janeiro, les gouvernements du monde entier ont adopt&#233; un plan d&#146;action mondial pour le d&#233;veloppement durable: Action 21. Ce document a pour objectif la r&#233;orientation de la coop&#233;ration internationale qui doit s&#146;attaquer simultan&#233;ment aux probl&#232;mes jumeaux que sont l&#146;aggravation de la pauvret&#233; et l&#146;incessante d&#233;t&#233;rioration de l&#146;environnement. Apr&#232;s Rio, les organismes donateurs et les gouvernements du Sud, leurs partenaires, ont commenc&#233; d&#146;envisager les implications de cette conf&#233;rence au plan des politiques et programmes de d&#233;veloppement. Nous avons pr&#233;par&#233; deux Notes d&#146;Information au sujet de la coop&#233;ration pour le d&#233;veloppement apr&#232;s le sommet plan&#233;taire. La premi&#232;re de ces notes, que voici, examine les origines, la significaiton et la port&#233;e op&#233;rationnelle de la notion de d&#233;veloppement durable</I>. 
<p>

<H3>De Stockholm &#224; Rio</H3>

Ces vingt derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, le d&#233;veloppement durable est apparu comme la meilleure fa&#231;on de faire face &#224; la d&#233;gradation rapide de l&#146;environnement naturel. La premi&#232;re rencontre mondiale sur ce th&#232;me, la Conf&#233;rence des Nations unies sur l&#146;environnement humain (Stockholm, 1972), s&#146;est surtout pench&#233;e sur des probl&#232;mes &#233;cologiques concernant principalement les pays riches et li&#233;s au d&#233;veloppement industriel et &#224; une rapide croissance de la consommation. On a bien moins pr&#234;t&#233; attention aux nations du Sud, pays &#224; revenus inf&#233;rieurs, et au besoin de stabilit&#233; et de solidit&#233; de leurs &#233;conomies ainsi qu&#146;&#224; la n&#233;cessit&#233; d&#146;am&#233;liorer leurs environnements. Bien que le besoin d&#146;une alliance des objectifs du d&#233;veloppement et de l&#146;&#233;cologie soit devenu de plus en plus &#233;vident, on mettait alors plut&#244;t l&#146;accent sur les &#171;limites de la croissance&#187; impos&#233;es par le manque de ressources, de ressources non-renouvelables en particulier, comme les m&#233;taux et les combustibles fossiles.
<P>
Cette pr&#233;occupation nouvelle pour ce qu&#146;on en vint &#224; appeler le &#171;d&#233;veloppement durable&#187; inspire clairement la D&#233;claration de Cocoyoc (1974), dont les auteurs se demandaient comment respecter la &#171;limite int&#233;rieure&#187;, correspondant &#224; la satisfaction des besoins humains fondamentaux, dans le pourtour trac&#233; par les &#171;limites ext&#233;rieures&#187; de la capacit&#233; de charge de la plan&#232;te. Ce fut &#224; la Strat&#233;gie mondiale de la conservation, &#233;tablie conjointement en 1980 par l&#146;Union mondiale pour la nature (IUCN), le Programme des Nations unies pour l&#146;environnement (PNUE) et le Fond mondial pour la nature (WWF), qu&#146;il revint de propulser le d&#233;veloppement durable dans l&#146;ar&#232;ne politique internationale, en soulignant l&#146;importance d&#146;int&#233;grer au processus de d&#233;veloppement les valeurs de protection et de conservation de l&#146;environnement.
<P>
La Strat&#233;gie mondiale de la conservation d&#233;boucha sur l&#146;&#233;laboration d&#146;une premi&#232;re g&#233;n&#233;ration de strat&#233;gies nationales de conservation, au Nord comme au Sud. Mais il fallut attendre 1987 pour que la Commission mondiale sur l&#146;environnement et le d&#233;veloppement, dite &#171;commission Brundtland&#187;, produise une d&#233;finition du d&#233;veloppement durable d&#233;sormais presque universellement cit&#233;e:
<P><ul>
&#171;<I>un d&#233;veloppement qui pourvoit aux besoins da la g&#233;n&#233;ration actuelle sans mettre en p&#233;ril les possibilit&#233;s des  g&#233;n&#233;ration suivantes de pourvoir eux aussi &#224; leurs besoins</I>.&#187;
</ul><P>
La quatri&#232;me Convention de Lom&#233; ACP-UE, sign&#233;e en d&#233;cembre 1989, int&#233;grait les le&#231;ons de la commission Brundtland, ce qui en fit peut-&#234;tre la premi&#232;re convention sur le d&#233;veloppement durable. En son article 4, elle indiquait que &#171;le d&#233;veloppement repose sur un &#233;quilibre durable entre ses objectifs &#233;conomiques, la gestion rationnelle de l&#146;environnement et la valorisation des ressources naturelles et humaines&#187;, tandis que son nouveau Titre I, sur l&#146;environnement, pr&#233;cisait les principes, priorit&#233;s et proc&#233;dures devant permettre d&#146;incorporer un &#171;r&#233;flexe &#233;cologique&#187; dans toutes les autres op&#233;rations relevant de Lom&#233;. Si on analyse des programmes indicatifs nationaux et r&#233;gionaux de la p&#233;riode 1990-1995, qui repr&#233;sentent la majeure partie de l&#146;aide d&#233;bours&#233;e dans le cadre de Lom&#233; IV, on constate que l&#146;objectif d&#146;int&#233;gration de l&#146;environnement a &#233;t&#233; partiellement r&#233;alis&#233;. Seul un petit nombre de ces programmes &#224; fait place, au niveau strat&#233;gique, au d&#233;veloppement durable en tant que question trans-sectorielle, bien que presque tous les programmes de d&#233;veloppement rural aient incorpor&#233; les facteurs environnementaux. Quant aux fonds accord&#233;s par la CE aux projets essentiellement ax&#233;s sur l&#146;environnement, ils &#233;taient aussi en augmentation, &#233;quivalant approximativement &#224; 10 % du total pour 1990-95.
<P>
La commission Brundtland a ouvert la voie &#224; la Conf&#233;rence des Nations unies sur l&#146;environnement et le d&#233;veloppement (CNUED), connue aussi sous le nom de &#171;sommet plan&#233;taire&#187;, laquelle a approuv&#233; un ensemble de cinq accords:
<ul>
<li><I>Action 21</I>, plan d&#146;action mondial pour un d&#233;veloppement durable, couvrant plus de 100 domaines programmatiques qui vont du commerce et de l&#146;environnement au &#145;renforcement des capacit&#233;s et au transfert de technologies en passant par l&#146;agriculture et la d&#233;sertification (cf. Notes d&#146;information No <A HREF="bp4_fr.html">4</A> et <A HREF="bp5_fr.html">5</A>).
<p>
<li>La <i>D&#233;claration de Rio sur l&#146;environnement et le d&#233;veloppement</I>, proclamation de 27 principes-cl&#233;s devant guider l&#146;int&#233;gration des politiques de l&#146;environnement et du d&#233;veloppement (dont les principes de pr&#233;vention, de pr&#233;caution et de participation, ainsi que celui voulant que &#171;les pollueurs soient les payeurs&#187;).
<p>
<li>La <I>D&#233;claration de principes au sujet des for&#234;ts</I>, premi&#232;re expression d&#146;un consensus mondial sur la gestion, la conservation et le d&#233;veloppement durable des for&#234;ts de la plan&#232;te.
<p>
<li>La Convention-cadre sur <I>l&#146;&#233;volution du climat</I>, accord ayant force de loi et visant &#224; stabiliser &#224; un niveau ne pouvant bouleverser le syst&#232;me climatique plan&#233;taire, le volume dans l&#146;atmosph&#232;re des gaz cr&#233;ateurs de l&#146;effet de serre (cf. Notes d&#146;information No <A HREF="bp6_fr.html">6</A> et <A HREF="bp9_fr.html">9</A>).
<p>
<li>La Convention sur la <I>diversit&#233; biologique</I>, accord ayant force de loi et visant &#224; pr&#233;server la diversit&#233; de la plan&#232;te, au plan g&#233;n&#233;tique ainsi qu&#146;&#224; ceux des esp&#232;ces et des &#233;cosyst&#232;mes, et &#224; r&#233;partir de fa&#231;on juste et &#233;quitable les avantages de son exploitation.
</ul><p>
La Communaut&#233; europ&#233;enne a adopt&#233; l&#146;ensemble de ces cinq accords et a pr&#233;sent&#233; son Cinqui&#232;me programme d&#146;action pour l&#146;environnement comme l&#146;instrument strat&#233;gique de leur mise en application en ce qui la concerne. Le d&#233;veloppement durable est aussi devenu une composante &#233;minente du Trait&#233; d&#146;union europ&#233;enne, aussi bien en tant qu&#146;objectif global de l&#146;Union (Article 2) qu&#146;en ce qui concerne ses politiques d&#146;environnement et de d&#233;veloppement (Article 130 r-y).
<P>
Maintenant que des engagements juridiques et politiques ont &#233;t&#233; pris au plus haut niveau en faveur du d&#233;veloppement durable, il importe de d&#233;finir avec plus de pr&#233;cision quelle est la signification de ce concept, quelles en sont les implications dans l&#146;&#233;laboration des politiques &#224; suivre et comment il peut &#234;tre mis en pratique de la base au sommet.

<H3>Le concept en application</H3>

La bataille pour l&#146;obtention d&#146;un soutien g&#233;n&#233;ral au concept de d&#233;veloppement durable a &#233;t&#233; effectivement gagn&#233;e. Les d&#233;cideurs se soucient d&#233;sormais de le mettre en application ou de le rendre op&#233;rationnel, en pr&#233;parant, par exemple, des politiques pour une agriculture durable, en orientant leur soutien vers la foresterie durable ou en &#233;laborant des strat&#233;gies nationales de durabilit&#233; (cf. <A HREF="bp3_fr.html">Note d&#146;information No 3</A>).
<P>
Mais, comme l&#146;a relev&#233; le gouvernement su&#233;dois dans son r&#233;cent rapport sur l&#146;aide au d&#233;veloppement apr&#232;s la CNUED, &#171;il n&#146;existe pas de d&#233;finition univoque du concept de d&#233;veloppement durable&#187;. Cette absence d&#146;une d&#233;finition claire a permis &#224; certains de pr&#233;tendre qu&#146;ils pratiquent le d&#233;veloppement durable alors qu&#146;ils se contentent de donner un emballage nouveau &#224; des approches inchang&#233;es pour l&#146;essentiel.
<P>
Ce probl&#232;me tient en partie &#224; la confusion qui entoure ce qui est &#171;p&#233;rennis&#233;&#187; par le &#171;d&#233;veloppement durable&#187;. Bien que le terme &#171;durable&#187; connaisse son acception la plus large lorsqu&#146;il fait r&#233;f&#233;rence &#224; la pr&#233;servation de syst&#232;mes et ressources &#233;cologiques, il a aussi &#233;t&#233; utilis&#233; dans la sph&#232;re de l&#146;&#233;conomie, dans celle du social et m&#234;me dans celle de la culture.
<P>
Ces usages multiples de &#171;durabilit&#233;&#187; ne devraient peut-&#234;tre pas trop surprendre, puisque le d&#233;veloppement durable est intrins&#232;quement un concept interdisciplinaire, s&#146;inspirant des sciences naturelles aussi bien que sociales et se nourrissant aupr&#232;s du droit, du management et de la politique. Il recouvre aussi une approche dynamique, puisqu&#146;il s&#146;agit, selon la commission Brundtland, d&#146;un &#171;processus de transformation dans lequel l&#146;exploitation des ressources, la direction des investissements, l&#146;orientation des techniques et les changements institutionnels se font de mani&#232;re harmonieuse et renforcent le potentiel pr&#233;sent et &#224; venir permettant de mieux r&#233;pondre aux besoins et aspirations de l&#146;humanit&#233;.&#187;
<P>
Le sommet plan&#233;taire a su mettre en &#233;vidence que la satisfaction des besoins humains repr&#233;sente la pierre angulaire du d&#233;veloppement durable. Il s&#146;ensuit que, selon l&#146;Organisation mondiale de la sant&#233;, &#171;les probl&#232;mes d&#146;environnement les plus pressants au monde sont le mauvais &#233;tat de sant&#233; et les d&#233;c&#232;s pr&#233;matur&#233;s dus aux agents biologiques pr&#233;sents dans l&#146;environnement humain - dans l&#146;eau, dans les aliments, dans l&#146;air ou dans le sol&#187;. Le hors-texte No 1 pr&#233;sente les implications de tout engagement de satisfaire les besoins des g&#233;n&#233;rations actuelles et futures.
<P>
De nos jours, ces pr&#233;conditions sont rarement remplies et le monde, en cons&#233;quence, para&#238;t englu&#233; dans diverses tendances de d&#233;g&#233;n&#233;rescence qui paraissent l&#146;entra&#238;ner loin de la durabilit&#233;, plut&#244;t qu&#146;en sa direction. En d&#233;pit de la multiplicit&#233; des origines de ce d&#233;clin, il est possible de les regrouper en deux grands ensembles: les &#233;checs du march&#233;, lorsque les transactions &#233;conomiques n&#233;gligent de tenir compte des co&#251;ts sociaux ou &#233;cologiques et les &#233;checs politiques, lorsque les gouvernements encouragent, par m&#233;garde, la d&#233;gradation de l&#146;environnement (en subventionnant, par exemple, la consommation d&#146;&#233;nergie et d&#146;eau). Il ne s&#146;agit donc pas de savoir si les gouvernements doivent intervenir pour orienter le d&#233;veloppement vers la durabilit&#233;, mais comment ils doivent le faire.

<H3>&#201;quilibrer les objectifs</H3>

Le d&#233;veloppement durable a pour but l&#146;inversion de ces tendances pernicieuses. S&#146;il fait l&#146;objet d&#146;un consensus de plus en plus r&#233;pandu quant &#224; sa signification - l&#146;obtention d&#146;une qualit&#233; de vie susceptible d&#146;&#234;tre pr&#233;serv&#233;e pour de nombreuses g&#233;n&#233;rations - c&#146;est parce qu&#146;il est:
<ul>
<li><I>socialement d&#233;sirable</I>, car il satisfait avec &#233;quit&#233; les besoins culturel, mat&#233;riel et 	spirituel des populations;
<p>
<li><I>&#233;conomiquement viable</I>, car il est autofinanc&#233; et ses co&#251;ts n&#146;exc&#233;dent pas les revenus; 	et
<p>
<li><I>&#233;cologiquement durable</I>, car il pr&#233;serve la viabilit&#233; &#224; long terme des &#233;cosyst&#232;mes qui 	en sont le substrat.
</ul><p>
Ces trois objectifs d&#233;limitent les r&#233;sultats requis des syst&#232;mes qui sont au c&#156;ur m&#234;me du d&#233;veloppement et sont &#224; leur tour sous l&#146;influence de facteurs contextuels plus vastes, comme la paix et la s&#233;curit&#233;, la vie politique, les dispositions institutionnelles et les normes culturelles (cf. Fig. 1).
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="fig1f.gif"></center>
<p>
Les trois syst&#232;mes de base, fondements du d&#233;veloppement durable - l&#146;&#233;cologique, l&#146;&#233;conomique et le social - sont d&#146;une extr&#234;me complexit&#233;. Pour aboutir au d&#233;veloppement durable, il est crucial d&#146;&#233;tablir un &#233;quilibre entre les besoins du pr&#233;sent et ceux de l&#146;avenir, de m&#233;nager l&#146;espace n&#233;cessaire aux incertitudes des situations futures et d&#146;admettre les diff&#233;rences locales, celles des valeurs comme celles des circonstances.
<p>
Des choix difficiles et de v&#233;ritables concessions devront &#234;tre n&#233;goci&#233;s. Ces n&#233;gociations seront fortement influenc&#233;es par les int&#233;r&#234;ts &#233;conomiques dominants et par les normes culturelles, les syst&#232;mes politiques et les dispositions institutionnelles, qui varient d&#146;un pays &#224; l&#146;autre. Traditionnellement, les soci&#233;t&#233;s humaines ont essay&#233; d&#146;assigner des buts &#224; chacun de ces syst&#232;mes, en les traitant souvent s&#233;par&#233;ment. C&#146;est ainsi que les objectifs en mati&#232;re de conservation de la nature ont &#233;t&#233; fix&#233;s sans tenir compte de ceux de la croissance &#233;conomique ou de la diminution de la pauvret&#233;. En cons&#233;quence, on a vu se cr&#233;er des &#171;&#238;solats verts&#187; de courte dur&#233;e, flottant sur une mer o&#249; la durabilit&#233; &#233;tait inconnue. Les d&#233;cideurs prennent mieux conscience, de nos jours, du fait que les objectifs en mati&#232;re d&#146;environnement ne peuvent &#234;tre atteints qu&#146;en les int&#233;grant aux grands axes des politiques sociales et &#233;conomiques.

<H3>Parvenir aux concessions</H3>

Il existe une approche pragmatique qui r&#233;pond &#224; la question: &#171;quelle est la meilleure fa&#231;on de r&#233;aliser un d&#233;veloppement durable?&#187;. Elle consiste &#224; partir de l&#146;hypoth&#232;se que le d&#233;veloppement implique, intrins&#232;quement, des concesssions r&#233;ciproques entre buts potentiellement oppos&#233;s, comme par exemple entre la croissance &#233;conomique et la conservation des ressources, ou entre la technologie moderne et les pratiques indig&#232;nes. Ces conflits sont souvent tout &#224; fait r&#233;els, mais leur acuit&#233; varie grandement selon les circonstances. On cite souvent la pauvret&#233; comme cause de d&#233;gradation de l&#146;environnement, mais on conna&#238;t de nombreux exemples de soci&#233;t&#233;s pauvres qui vivent en harmonie avec leur environnement. De m&#234;me, on dit souvent que la croissance d&#233;mographique des pays en d&#233;veloppement ne peut qu&#146;aboutir in&#233;vitablement &#224; une collision avec la base des ressources naturelles. Or il existe des cas de croissance d&#233;mographique associ&#233;e &#224; une meilleure gestion des ressources. La relation entre la croissance &#233;conomique et la d&#233;gradation de l&#146;environnement n&#146;est pas toujours marqu&#233;e au sceau de l&#146;in&#233;luctabilit&#233;, mais elle pose un d&#233;fi au niveau politique: il s&#146;agit d&#146;adopter une politique qui sache creuser l&#146;&#233;cart entre la croissance des revenus et l&#146;absorption des ressources et la pollution, t&#226;che qui s&#146;est av&#233;r&#233;e bien difficile &#224; accomplir en pratique.
<p>
Le but du d&#233;veloppement durable consiste donc &#224; optimiser l&#146;accomplissement simultan&#233; des objectifs nombreux et vari&#233;s (sociaux, &#233;cologiques et &#233;conomiques) d&#146;une soci&#233;t&#233; donn&#233;e. Il vaudrait mieux qu&#146;on y parvienne gr&#226;ce &#224; un processus d&#146;adaptation int&#233;grante, mais, plus fr&#233;quemment, cela n&#233;cessitera des accommodements (ou concessions mutuelles) entre les diff&#233;rents groupes d&#146;int&#233;r&#234;ts concern&#233;s. Un &#233;l&#233;ment crucial de ce processus est l&#146;acceptation du caract&#232;re &#224; la fois in&#233;vitable et l&#233;gitime des divergences de points de vues quant &#224; l&#146;environnement et au d&#233;veloppement. Il peut y avoir, par exemple, des priorit&#233;s tr&#232;s diff&#233;rentes, en mati&#232;re d&#146;environnement, entre les donateurs, les gouvernements b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires et les pauvres des pays en d&#233;veloppement.
<p>
On peut envisager ces concessions de diff&#233;rentes mani&#232;res, l&#146;une d&#146;entre elles &#233;tant l&#146;approche &#233;conomique et l&#146;identification des stocks de capital humain et naturel n&#233;cessaires au d&#233;veloppement. Des politiques explicites sont requises pour pr&#233;server et valoriser notre patrimoine (ou capital) naturel et ses contributions au d&#233;veloppement: mati&#232;res premi&#232;res, eau douce et climat stable. Il faudra proc&#233;der &#224; des distinctions en son sein, entre les stocks cruciaux, ceux qui sont irrempla&#231;ables et ne peuvent &#234;tre &#233;chang&#233;s contre des avantages sociaux et &#233;conomiques, et ceux qui peuvent faire l&#146;objet d&#146;&#233;change pour l&#146;accumulation du capital technologique, pr&#233;servant ainsi des niveaux constants des stocks globaux de capital.

<H3>Le principe de participation</H3>

Se pose alors la question: qui devra d&#233;cider des concessions? C&#146;est ici que le document Action 21 appelle &#224; la participation la plus ample possible aux n&#233;gociations internationales, comme lors de la CNUED, aux exercices nationaux d&#146;&#233;laboration de strat&#233;gies et &#224; la conception et &#224; la r&#233;alisation des projets. Cette participation est cruciale, non seulement pour l&#146;efficacit&#233; et la l&#233;gitimit&#233; des actions entreprises, mais aussi &#224; cause de la relative absence d&#146;instruments et d&#146;indicateurs &#171;scientifiques&#187; pouvant fournir des r&#233;ponses imm&#233;diates aux d&#233;cideurs politiques. L&#146;&#233;laboration et l&#146;utilisation de techniques de d&#233;veloppement de consensus et de r&#233;solution de conflits formeront donc une composante importante du d&#233;veloppement durable. De nouveaux indicateurs de performances sont n&#233;cessaires, comme par exemple des indicateurs environnementaux am&#233;lior&#233;s du type &#171;rythmes d&#146;&#233;volution&#187;, ainsi que des indicateurs &#171;barom&#233;triques&#187;, r&#233;v&#233;lateurs des progr&#232;s r&#233;alis&#233;s ou reculs subis quant au d&#233;veloppement durable.
<p>
Les gouvernements nationaux ont pour responsabilit&#233; l&#146;&#233;tablissement de conditions permettant et facilitant les deux types d&#146;interactions n&#233;cessaires - le dialogue et la n&#233;gociation - entre tous les secteurs et groupes d&#146;int&#233;r&#234;t de la soci&#233;t&#233;. Les strat&#233;gies nationales de d&#233;veloppement durable qu&#146;appelle de ses v&#156;ux Action 21 pourront elles-m&#234;me d&#233;boucher sur une d&#233;mocratie mieux d&#233;velopp&#233;e, encourager la r&#233;vision des dispositions institutionnelles, des proc&#233;dures administratives et des cadres juridiques, tout en favorisant le consensus entre les diff&#233;rents groupements et strates de la soci&#233;t&#233;. Les donateurs peuvent accorder leur appui &#224; ce processus impuls&#233; par les nations en coordonnant leurs activit&#233;s, en &#233;vitant d&#146;imposer des mod&#232;les &#233;trangers et en regroupant leurs investissements actuels de mani&#232;re &#224; les aligner sur les objectifs adopt&#233;s par leur partenaire en vue d&#146;un d&#233;veloppement durable.

<H3>L&#146;action de l&#146;UE</H3>

La r&#233;cente introduction de l&#146;approche int&#233;gr&#233;e de la Gestion du Cycle de Projet et celle du Manuel sur l&#146;environnement ont fourni &#224; l&#146;UE les fondements d&#146;une am&#233;lioration des performances &#233;cologiques de l&#146;aide au d&#233;veloppement. La protection de l&#146;environnement est  un facteur-cl&#233; de la durabilit&#233; globale des projets dans le cadre du syst&#232;me de la GCP, tandis  que le Manuel sur l&#146;environnement explique de quelle mani&#232;re le facteur &#233;cologique peut &#234;tre int&#233;gr&#233; &#224; chaque &#233;tape du cycle de projet - de la conception &#224; l&#146;&#233;valuation finale.
<P>
Des Lignes directrices environnementales, qui doivent aider &#224; programmer la prochaine phase de Lom&#233; IV (1996-2000), ont aussi &#233;t&#233; r&#233;dig&#233;es. Elles reprennent les le&#231;ons de Rio en mati&#232;re de gestion de l&#146;aide, soulignant l&#146;importance de l&#146;int&#233;gration de l&#146;environnement &#224; la conception et &#224; la r&#233;alisation de toutes les activit&#233;s de l&#146;Union europ&#233;enne, ainsi que la valeur de l&#146;incorporation des facteurs sociaux et &#233;conomiques aux initiatives sp&#233;cifiquement consacr&#233;es &#224; la protection de l&#146;environnement. Les Lignes directrices ont d&#233;termin&#233; l&#146;objectif central qu&#146;est le renforcement des capacit&#233;s nationales des pays ACP aux plans humain, technologique, institutionnel et &#233;cologique dans les secteurs public, priv&#233; et civil (ONG).
<p>
Traitant des politiques de coop&#233;ration pour le d&#233;veloppement apr&#232;s le sommet plan&#233;taire, la prochaine Note d&#146;information examine les le&#231;ons tir&#233;es de la mise en pratique du concept de d&#233;veloppement durable dans les programmes d&#146;aide de l&#146;UE et de ses &#201;tats-membres.

<I>Depuis 20 ans, la communaut&#233; internationale s&#146;efforce de trouver des r&#233;ponses au ph&#233;nom&#232;ne souvent mal compris que l&#146;on appelle &#171;d&#233;sertification&#187;. En octobre 1994, une nouvelle Convention internationale sur la d&#233;sertification (CID) a &#233;t&#233; sign&#233;e.
<p>
Ce document repr&#233;sente le premier num&#233;ro d&#146;une s&#233;rie de notes d&#146;information visant &#224; stimuler la r&#233;flexion &#224; propos des d&#233;fis et des possibilit&#233;s pr&#233;sent&#233;s par la Convention. Les notes futures pourraient porter sur la promotion de la participation &#224; la gestion des ressources naturelles ; la d&#233;centralisation et le foncier ; le changement climatique et la d&#233;sertification ; la planification et les programmes nationaux; les m&#233;thodes performantes de l&#146;Union europ&#233;enne en mati&#232;re de coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement dans le domaine de la d&#233;sertification et les choix &#224; suivre</I>. 
<p>
<H3>Introduction : les zones arides et la d&#233;sertification</H3>

Les zones arides couvrent un tiers de la superficie de la terre et environ 900 millions de personnes y  habitent. Berceau de civilisations anciennes et pivot de syst&#232;mes de commerce au fil des si&#232;cles, elles sont &#233;galement source de nombreux produits agricoles et animaux uniques. Les r&#233;gions arides sont depuis toujours en proie aux al&#233;as pluviom&#233;triques et &#224; la s&#233;cheresse, les ann&#233;es d&#146;abondance c&#233;dant la place aux ann&#233;es maigres. Depuis deux d&#233;cennies, la d&#233;gradation &#224; plus long terme des r&#233;gions arides qui les rendrait moins capables de soutenir la vie &#224; l&#146;avenir, soul&#232;ve une inqui&#233;tude grandissante. Cette d&#233;gradation a &#233;t&#233; qualifi&#233;e de &#171;d&#233;sertification&#187;.
<p>
La d&#233;sertification englobe toute une s&#233;rie de probl&#232;mes, tels que la perte des sols &#224; cause de l&#146;&#233;rosion hydrique et &#233;olienne ; la baisse de la fertilit&#233; des sols ; la disparition de la couverture v&#233;g&#233;tale ; la vuln&#233;rabilit&#233; croissante face &#224; la s&#233;cheresse ; et une r&#233;duction g&#233;n&#233;rale de la diversit&#233; de la vie animale et v&#233;g&#233;tale. En d&#233;pit de cette susceptibilit&#233; &#224; la d&#233;gradation, il est &#233;galement reconnu que les syst&#232;mes des zones arides font preuve d&#146;une r&#233;sistance remarquable face &#224; des variations extr&#234;mes de pluviom&#233;trie et d&#146;utilisation de ressources.
<p>
La fr&#233;quence de la d&#233;gradation et la r&#233;sistance des zones arides varient &#233;norm&#233;ment d&#146;un endroit &#224; l&#146;autre, selon la nature des ressources concern&#233;es, les pressions touchant &#224; leur utilisation et les institutions de gestion. C&#146;est cette variabilit&#233; locale qui explique pourquoi les nouvelles approches de lutte contre la d&#233;sertification sont solidement ancr&#233;es au niveau local.
<p>
Comme nous l&#146;expliquerons plus loin, la d&#233;sertification ne concerne pas l&#146;avance du d&#233;sert. Si la mobilit&#233; des dunes peut poser probl&#232;me dans certains endroits, la menace principale qui p&#232;se sur les r&#233;gions arides ne se situe pas en bordure du d&#233;sert mais plut&#244;t dans les zones agricoles o&#249; de fortes pressions sur les terres peuvent d&#233;boucher sur le d&#233;clin progressif du potentiel de production.

<H3>La CID : un nouveau d&#233;part ?</H3>

Pendant les 20 derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, les efforts internationaux pour faire face aux probl&#232;mes de d&#233;sertification ont eu des r&#233;sultats mitig&#233;s. Suite &#224; la Conf&#233;rence sur la d&#233;sertification de l&#146;ONU &#224; Nairobi en 1977, plusieurs programmes de lutte contre la d&#233;sertification furent &#233;tablis aux niveaux national et r&#233;gional. N&#233;anmoins, ces programmes d&#146;action eurent peu ou pas d&#146;impact sur le terrain et ne repr&#233;sentaient souvent qu&#146;une liste de projets &#224; la recherche de financement. Il est maintenant reconnu que la gestion des zones arides r&#233;ussit uniquement lorsque les utilisateurs de la terre b&#233;n&#233;ficient de mesures incitatives et de droits solides vis-&#224;-vis de leurs ressources. Veiller &#224; ce que les orientations nationales aillent dans le bon sens est plus important que de pr&#233;parer des plans d&#233;taill&#233;s qui ne seront pas mis en oeuvre. La CID sugg&#232;re donc plusieurs changements d&#146;orientation qui permettront d&#146;assurer l&#146;utilisation plus durable des ressources, par exemple la s&#233;curit&#233; des droits  fonciers.

<H3>N&#233;gocier une convention mondiale</H3>

La Convention internationale de lutte contre la d&#233;sertification fut propos&#233;e pour la premi&#232;re fois lors des comit&#233;s pr&#233;paratoires de la Conf&#233;rence des Nations unies sur l&#146;environnement et le d&#233;veloppement (CNUED) qui eut lieu &#224; Rio en juin 1992. L&#146;int&#233;r&#234;t pour la Convention d&#233;coula de la non satisfaction ressentie par de nombreux pays africains face &#224; la mani&#232;re dont leur pr&#233;occupations particuli&#232;res furent trait&#233;es lors des pr&#233;paratifs de la CNUED. Par cons&#233;quent, un engagement formel fut pris &#224; Rio en faveur de la n&#233;gociation et l&#146;acceptation d&#146;une Convention mondiale de lutte contre la d&#233;sertification avant le mois de juin 1994. Quoique cette convention fut de port&#233;e et eut des vis&#233;es mondiales, il &#233;tait reconnu qu&#146;elle devrait porter une attention particuli&#232;re sur l&#146;Afrique, compte tenu de la pauvret&#233; de nombreux pays africains en zone aride et du manque de moyens d&#146;existence alternatifs pour leurs populations.

<p>
Au bout de cinq sessions du Comit&#233; international de n&#233;gociation, le texte de la Convention fut arr&#234;t&#233; en juin 1994, accompagn&#233; de quatre annexes r&#233;gionales, d&#146;une r&#233;solution sur l&#146;action urgente en faveur de l&#146;Afrique et d&#146;une r&#233;solution au sujet de la p&#233;riode int&#233;rimaire avant l&#146;entr&#233;e en vigueur de la CID. La Convention fut sign&#233;e &#224; Paris en octobre 1994 par plus de 80 Etats, y compris 13 des 15 Etats-membres de l&#146;UE r&#233;cemment agrandie, ainsi que la Communaut&#233; europ&#233;enne.
<P>
La p&#233;riode int&#233;rimaire commenc&#233;e en juin 1994 prendra fin lors de la premi&#232;re s&#233;ance de la conf&#233;rence des parties, probablement vers le d&#233;but de 1997. Cette p&#233;riode int&#233;rimaire de deux &#224; trois ans s&#146;explique par le d&#233;lai n&#233;cessaire pour que les gouvernements nationaux ratifient leur adh&#233;sion &#224; la convention en faisant approuver une l&#233;gislation par leur parlement. Un minimum de cinquante ratifications s&#146;impose avant que la CID puisse entrer en vigueur. La premi&#232;re Conf&#233;rence des parties a eu lieu six mois apr&#232;s la notification de la cinquanti&#232;me ratification de la Convention &#224; l&#146;ONU.
<P>
Pendant la p&#233;riode int&#233;rimaire, il est pr&#233;vu de convoquer plusieurs r&#233;unions rassemblant des repr&#233;sentants des gouvernements nationaux et des organismes internationaux. Le contenu de ces r&#233;unions reste &#224; pr&#233;ciser, &#233;tant donn&#233; que les n&#233;gociations de la CID furent achev&#233;es en juin 1994. La premi&#232;re de ces r&#233;unions int&#233;rimaires a eu lieu en janvier 1995 &#224; New York, la deuxi&#232;me en ao&#251;t 1995 &#224; Nairobi et la prochaine est pr&#233;vue pour le d&#233;but de 1996.   

<H3>La d&#233;sertification ou la d&#233;gradation des zones arides ?</H3>

Le terme de &#145;d&#233;sertification&#146; a eu une histoire mouvement&#233;e qui lui a fait acqu&#233;rir une s&#233;rie de sens qui ont servi &#224; embrouiller la discussion des enjeux r&#233;els. La d&#233;sertification fut d&#233;finie comme suit lors du Sommet de la terre &#224; Rio :
<P>
<ul><I>la d&#233;sertification est la d&#233;gradation des sols dans les zones arides, semi-arides et s&#232;ches sub-humides par suite de divers facteurs, parmi lesquels les variations climatiques et les activit&#233;s humaines</I>.</ul>
<P>
La d&#233;sertification implique donc la d&#233;gradation des zones arides, les deux ph&#233;nom&#232;nes comportant une s&#233;rie de processus, tels que l&#146;&#233;rosion et la perte de la fertilit&#233; des sols, qui appauvrissent les sols et la v&#233;g&#233;tation. Les activit&#233;s humaines ont un r&#244;le tout aussi important que les facteurs climatiques dans ces processus de d&#233;gradation, la longue saison s&#232;che et les s&#233;cheresses intermittentes rendant plus difficile le renouvellement des &#233;cosyst&#232;mes des zones arides.
<P>
Nombreux sont ceux qui pr&#233;f&#232;rent utiliser le terme de d&#233;gradation des zones arides, le consid&#233;rant moins apte &#224; induire en erreur. La &#145;d&#233;sertification&#146; &#233;voque l&#146;image d&#146;un d&#233;sert qui avance, dont le progr&#232;s doit &#234;tre interrompu gr&#226;ce &#224; l&#146;&#233;tablissement d&#146;une barri&#232;re physique, telle qu&#146;une ceinture d&#146;arbres. Malgr&#233; l&#146;image populaire d&#146;un d&#233;sert qui avance, il n&#146;existe aucune preuve d&#146;un tel ph&#233;nom&#232;ne. Au lieu de cela, la fronti&#232;re du d&#233;sert se d&#233;place au fil du temps en fonction de la pluviom&#233;trie annuelle. Lors d&#146;une ann&#233;e de s&#233;cheresse telle que 1984, le d&#233;sert avance &#224; mesure que certaines plantes ne germent pas et d&#146;autres meurent. Par contre, lors d&#146;une ann&#233;e de fortes pr&#233;cipitations, telle que 1988 ou 1994, le d&#233;sert se retire &#224; mesure que les herbes et arbustes s&#146;&#233;tablissent &#224; nouveau. Il existent des probl&#232;mes localis&#233;s de mobilit&#233; des dunes qu&#146;il faut aborder lorsqu&#146;elles mettent en danger un village, une route ou un cours d&#146;eau. N&#233;anmoins, par comparaison avec le d&#233;clin progressif du potentiel des terres agricoles en zone aride, l&#146;empi&#233;tement des dunes rev&#234;t beaucoup moins d&#146;importance en termes du nombre de personnes touch&#233;es et des co&#251;ts de la productivit&#233; perdue.

<H3>Quel est le probl&#232;me r&#233;el ?</H3>

Il est difficile de se procurer des chiffres concernant le taux de d&#233;sertification. Par le pass&#233;, le Programme des Nations unies pour l&#146;environnement s&#146;est efforc&#233; de compiler des donn&#233;es sur la fr&#233;quence et la gravit&#233; de la d&#233;sertification aux niveaux r&#233;gional et mondial. N&#233;anmoins, il est g&#233;n&#233;ralement reconnu que les donn&#233;es sont tr&#232;s peu fiables. Il existe peu ou pas de donn&#233;es permettant de mesurer les tendances de la d&#233;gradation pendant une p&#233;riode raisonnable. Au lieu de cela, nous devons compter sur des mesures de substitution, telles que les rendements des cultures, pour estimer les tendances de la productivit&#233; sous-jacente. Or, il est &#233;vident que toute une s&#233;rie d&#146;autres facteurs ont une forte influence sur les rendements - volume et chronologie des pr&#233;cipitations, main-d&#146;oeuvre consacr&#233;e au sarclage, attaques d&#146;insectes nuisibles, etc. - ce qui limite l&#146;utilit&#233; de ces derniers sur le plan de l&#146;appr&#233;ciation du taux de d&#233;gradation. Ils existent diff&#233;rentes causes sous-jacentes de la d&#233;gradation des zones arides :
<ul>
<li><I>Au niveau des champs</I>, d&#233;nudation des sols par le labour, absence de mesures de conservation des sols ;
<li>Au niveau du village ou district, pression sur les terres disponibles pour la culture, absence d&#146;appui de credit
<li><I>Au niveau national</I>, ins&#233;curit&#233; des droits fonciers et d&#146;acc&#232;s &#224; l&#146;eau, politiques nationales favorisant les populations urbaines, peu de possibilit&#233;s d&#146;emploi alternatif ; et
<li><I>Au niveau international</I>, taux d&#146;endettement &#233;lev&#233;s, faibles prix des cultures d&#146;exportation.
</ul>

<table border=1 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><center><h4>LE DOCUMENT DE LA CONVENTION</h4></center>
<p>
Le texte principal de la Convention se compose de 40 articles couvrant 35 pages. Les six chapitres principaux portent sur :
<ul>
<li>L&#146;introduction et les d&#233;finitions (Articles 1-3)
<li>Les obligations g&#233;n&#233;rales des diff&#233;rentes parties ; la priorit&#233; accord&#233;e &#224; l&#146;Afrique et les relations de la CID avec d&#146;autres conventions (Articles 4-8)
<li>Les programmes d&#146;action, la coop&#233;ration scientifique et technique et les mesures d&#146;appui, y compris les dispositions et m&#233;canismes financiers (Articles 9-21)
<li>Les institutions de la convention (Articles 22-25)
<li>Les proc&#233;dures de r&#232;glement des diff&#233;rends, de r&#233;vision ; les droits de vote (Articles 26-32)
<li>Les dispositions finales concernant la signature, la ratification, l&#146;entr&#233;e en vigueur et les amendements (Articles 33-40)
</ul><p>
Il y a quatre annexes r&#233;gionales de longueur et de complexit&#233; variables couvrant : l&#146;Afrique, l&#146;Asie, l&#146;Am&#233;rique Latine et la r&#233;gion nord de la M&#233;diterran&#233;e. L&#146;annexe africaine fournit des conseils d&#233;taill&#233;s en mati&#232;re de pr&#233;paration des programmes d&#146;action de lutte contre la d&#233;sertification (aux niveaux national, sous-r&#233;gional et r&#233;gional) et d&#233;crit les m&#233;canismes de coordination visant &#224; assurer une plus grande collaboration entre les bailleurs de fonds, les ONG, les structures gouvernementales et les organisations communautaires locales. Les trois autres annexes r&#233;gionales sont beaucoup plus courtes.
<p>
La r&#233;solution sur les mesures &#224; prendre d&#146;urgence pour l&#146;Afrique vot&#233;e en juin 1994, incite les gouvernements &#224; commencer imm&#233;diatement &#224; mettre en oeuvre la CID, en d&#233;pit du d&#233;lai d&#146;environ deux ans avant la ratification de la Convention. Parmi les mesures propos&#233;es dans le cadre de la r&#233;solution sont :
<ul>
<li>la diffusion par tous les pays d&#146;informations concernant la Convention, afin de sensibiliser le public &#224; la CID et aux engagements des diff&#233;rentes parties
<li>l&#146;amorce de la pr&#233;paration de programmes d&#146;action nationaux de lutte contre la d&#233;sertification, prenant pour base les programmes existants, dans la mesure du possible

<H3>Une approche ax&#233;e sur le niveau local</H3>

Si les programmes d&#146;action nationaux et r&#233;gionaux ont apport&#233; peu de progr&#232;s pour les communaut&#233;s de base, il existe de nombreux exemples positifs d&#146;am&#233;nagement des zones arides. La r&#233;ussite tient g&#233;n&#233;ralement &#224; plusieurs &#233;l&#233;ments communs. L&#146;accent est mis surtout sur les actions locales en collaboration avec les populations et sur le renforcement des capacit&#233;s de ces derni&#232;res selon leurs propres priorit&#233;s. La CID a pour but de reproduire ces r&#233;ussites &#224; une plus grande &#233;chelle en exigeant que les diff&#233;rentes parties concern&#233;es modifient leur comportement. En termes g&#233;n&#233;raux, la CID &#233;tablit un code de conduite pour les gouvernements nationaux, les bailleurs de fonds bilat&#233;raux, les organismes multilat&#233;raux et les organisations non-gouvernementales qui cherchent &#224; d&#233;velopper des approches plus prometteuses d&#146;am&#233;nagement des zones arides.

La Convention sur la d&#233;sertification offre au gouvernement des pays touch&#233;s d&#146;excellentes  perspectives de consolidation du soutien des bailleurs de fonds pour l&#146;am&#233;nagement des zones arides. Il est indispensable qu&#146;ils profitent de cette occasion et prouvent leur volont&#233; de respecter les engagements pris dans le cadre de la Convention. Si l&#146;initiative principale doit rester entre les mains des gouvernements nationaux, les bailleurs de fonds ont &#224; jouer le r&#244;le crucial d&#146;encourager une approche souple et ax&#233;e sur les processus et de faire preuve de bonne volont&#233; quant &#224; la mise en commun de leurs int&#233;r&#234;ts et ressources en faveur des programmes du gouvernement national.
<p>
N&#233;anmoins, en derni&#232;re analyse, l&#146;action des gouvernements nationaux et des bailleurs de fonds sera inutile &#224; moins d&#146;&#233;tablir un cadre g&#233;n&#233;ral dans lequel les populations locales - &#233;leveurs, agriculteurs - sont encourag&#233;s &#224; agir. Les engagements dans le cadre de la CID visent &#224; faciliter l&#146;action des utilisateurs de la terre, en renfor&#231;ant leur capacit&#233; et leur motivation &#224; faire face &#224; la d&#233;gradation des zones arides. Or, les populations locales n&#146;auront int&#233;r&#234;t &#224; faire des investissements &#224; long terme que lorsqu&#146;elles disposeront de droits fonciers assur&#233;s et lorsque de telles activit&#233;s pr&#233;senteront des avantages &#233;conomiques &#233;vidents.
<p>
La CID pr&#244;ne avant tout la pr&#233;paration de programmes d&#146;action nationaux de lutte contre la d&#233;sertification, dans la mesure du possible ax&#233;s sur des plans et strat&#233;gies existants de protection de l&#146;environnement. De tels programmes sont cens&#233;s :
<ul>
<li>&#234;tre pr&#233;par&#233;s &#224; partir de la consultation et de la participation
<li>mettre l&#146;accent sur des programmes locaux de d&#233;veloppement int&#233;gr&#233;
<li>proposer une s&#233;rie d&#146;actions visant &#224; renforcer la capacit&#233; au sein des structures d&#233;centralis&#233;es, et
<li>promouvoir l&#146;&#233;ducation et la formation des populations locales.
</ul>
<H3>Assurer la mise en oeuvre de la planification</H3>

Si la s&#233;rie d&#146;engagements figurant dans le texte de la CID constitue une gageure, il faut veiller &#224; ce que toute cette rh&#233;torique admirable d&#233;bouche sur des actions concr&#232;tes. Une analyse approfondie des exp&#233;riences pass&#233;es permet de constater que de nombreux plans bien &#233;labor&#233;s ont des r&#233;sultats m&#233;diocres, ce qui s&#146;explique, entre autres, par :	
<ul>
<li>la concurrence entre les bailleurs de fonds et leurs plans, programmes et strat&#233;gies respectifs ;
<li>les minist&#232;res qui se disputent la responsabilit&#233; et, par l&#224;, le financement ;
<li>le manque d&#146;int&#233;r&#234;t pour ces programmes de protection de l&#146;environnement et d&#146;appropriation de ces derniers par les gouvernements b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires ;
<li>l&#146;absence d&#146;effort pour faire participer les populations et organisations locales &#224; la formulation des programmes et politiques.
</ul><p>
Pour que la Convention sur la d&#233;sertification porte ses fruits, il faut que les gouvernements des pays touch&#233;s soient convaincus du besoin de programmes d&#146;action nationaux et de les pr&#233;parer par la consultation et la participation. Il faut pour cela que les gouvernements, les bailleurs de fonds, les ONG et les communaut&#233;s de base disposent de davantage d&#146;informations au sujet de la Convention et des perspectives offertes par cet accord.
<p>
Des questions importantes demeurent en ce qui concerne la mise en oeuvre de la Convention sur la d&#233;sertification, dont :
<ul>
<li>Qu&#146;est-ce qu&#146;un processus de planification participative ? Qui doit participer et de quelle fa&#231;on ? Est-ce important ?
<li>Quelle sera l&#146;articulation des programmes d&#146;action nationaux de lutte contre la d&#233;sertification avec d&#146;autres initiatives de planification actuellement en cours, telles que les strat&#233;gies nationales de conservation, les plans d&#146;action foresti&#232;re et les programmes d&#146;action nationaux pour l&#146;environnement ?
<li>Quels sont les liens entre le changement climatique et la d&#233;sertification ?
<li>Quelle est l&#146;importance des questions techniques, par opposition aux facteurs socio-&#233;conomiques, dans la lutte contre la d&#233;sertification ? Pourquoi le foncier et la d&#233;centralisation sont-ils aussi fondamentaux dans le cadre de la Convention ?
</ul>
<H3>Trouver le r&#244;le de l&#146;UE</H3>

Par le pass&#233;, la CE et ses Etats-membres ont fourni l&#146;essentiel du financement de programmes de d&#233;veloppement visant &#224; combattre la d&#233;sertification, notamment en Afrique. Le Plan d&#146;action europ&#233;en de lutte contre la d&#233;sertification a &#233;t&#233; lanc&#233; il y a presque dix ans. La CID invite l'Union &#224; relever le d&#233;fi d&#146;un programme d&#146;action strat&#233;gique permettant de soutenir la gestion durable des zones arides, notamment lors de la prochaine phase de la Convention de Lom&#233;. Il faut que les responsables politiques europ&#233;ens &#233;valuent d&#232;s maintenant les cons&#233;quences de la CID pour la programmation de l&#146;aide future.

<I>La Convention-cadre des Nations unies sur le changements climatiques a été signée par 155 pays et par la Communauté Européenne lors du sommet planétaire de Rio, en juin 1994. Entrée en vigueur en mars 1994, elle engage ses signataires du monde industrialisé à adopter des stratégies de contrôle des émissions de gaz «à effet de serre» sur leur territoire et à aider les nations en voie de développement à respecter leurs obligations conventionnelles grâce à des aides financières, au transfert de technologie et au renforcement des capacités. Cette Note d’information sur le changement du climat entend stimuler la réflexion et la discussion parmi les responsables des politiques européens au sujet des conséquences de la Convention-cadre pour les stratégies de coopération. Il s’agit de voir comment on peut intégrer des mesures de lutte contre une menace à long terme telle que le changement climatique et des actions répondant à des préoccupations sociales, économiques et écologiques plus immédiates.</I> 
<p>
<H3>Introduction</H3>

La perspective d’un changement climatique à   long terme - le réchauffement de la planète - dû aux émissions de gaz «à effet de serre» (gaz carbonique et méthane, par exemple) représente un grave danger pour la durabilité des stratégies de développement.
<p>
Lors de la Conférence internationale sur l’impact des changements climatiques et de la hausse du niveau de la mer, organisée à Hanoi en novembre 1991, les participants ont préconisé que «la prise en considération du changement climatique à long terme fasse partie intégrante de l’élaboration d’une stratégie nationale de développement durable.» Cette conclusion s’inspirait de deux aspects fondamentaux du problème de réchauffement de la planète :
<ul>
<li>En premier lieu, les conséquences du changement climatique à long terme pourraient sérieusement entraver les perspectives de développement de divers pays. La hausse du niveau de la mer, par exemple, pourrait mettre en jeu la survie même de certains Etats insulaires.
<p>
<li>En second lieu, l’accroissement constant des émissions de gaz «à effet de serre» est précisément dû à l’utilisation croissante d’énergie provenant de combustibles fossiles, à l’expansion de l’industrie et à l’extension de l’agriculture - il découle donc du processus de développement.
</ul><p>
Toute tentative visant à restreindre l’ampleur du problème de réchauffement de la planète doit donc s’attaquer à la nature même du processus de développement. C’est pour cela que les responsables de la politique d’aide et de sa mise en oeuvre ont un rôle-clé à jouer.
<p>
L’Union Européenne a joué un rôle majeur dans l’élaboration de la Convention-cadre sur les changements climatiques. Actuellement, elle fait pression pour qu’on assigne au contrôle des émissions des objectifs plus efficaces et elle anime le débat dans plusieurs autres domaines touchant à la mise en oeuvre de la convention. Celle-ci exige des nations industrialisées qu’elles aident les nations en développement à respecter les obligations contractées sous ses auspices, grâce au transfert de ressources financières et de technologies et au renforcement des capacités.
<p>
L’assistance fournie aux nations en développement par l’Union Européenne - qui est, avec ses États-membres le donateur le plus important du monde - influencera la contribution future du Sud à la résolution du problème. Elle déterminera également la capacité des nations les plus vulnérables, comme les petits États insulaires, à faire face aux conséquences défavorables du changement climatique.
<p>
Le défi posé consiste à faire en sorte que les actions d’amortissement de l’impact du changement climatique à long terme soient compatibles avec cet objectif plus vaste qu’est le développement durable.

<H3>La Convention-cadre sur les changements climatiques</H3>

Le Groupe d’expert intergouvernemental sur l’évolution du climat (GEIEC) a été mis sur pied en 1988 par l’Organisation météorologique mondiale et par le Programme des Nations unies pour l’Environnement, en réponse à l’inquiétude internationale suscitée par l’éventualité d’un réchauffement de la planète.
<p>
Sa première tâche a consisté à faire le point des connaissances et hypothèses scientifiques relatives au problème de l’effet de serre et à évaluer la gravité de cette menace. Il a conclu que les constatations scientifiques actuelles sont telles qu’elles justifient des actions préventives de réduction des émissions de gaz «à effet de serre» et permettent d’envisager les effets potentiels de ce phénomène.
<p>
Par conséquent, un Comité intergouvernemental de négociation a été établi afin de préparer un traité sur le climat. La Convention-cadre des Nations unies sur les changements climatiques a finalement été l’objet d’un accord au sommet de la terre à Rio en juin 1992 et est entrée en vigueur en mars 1994.
<p>
En signant la Convention-cadre, les nations individuelles, ou les groupements régionaux tels que l’Union européenne, s’engagent à poursuivre l’objectif global de «stabilisation des concentrations de gaz «à effet de serre» dans l’atmosphère à un niveau susceptible d’empêcher toute ingérence anthropogénique dangereuse dans le système climatique.» On doit parvenir à cette stabilisation dans un délai «(...) permettant au développement économique de progresser de manière durable.»
<p>
Hormis le contrôle des émissions, la convention préconise des actions visant à prévoir et à minimiser les conséquences les plus graves du changement climatique et de la hausse du niveau de la mer. Elle souligne l’importance de l’éducation, de la formation et du renforcement des capacités pour assurer les fondations de la réponse internationale à ce problème à long terme. Le Comité intergouvernemental de négociation continue à se réunir et sert de forum décisionnel pour la mise en oeuvre de la Convention-cadre. Les progrès à ce sujet ont été évalués lors de la première conférence des parties contractantes à Berlin en mars 1995.

<H3>Qui sont les responsables du réchauffement de la planète ?</H3>

Il est acquis que la responsabilité primaire du réchauffement de la planète incombe aux nations industrialisées. Depuis 1870, les pays en voie de développement n’ont produit que 15 % des émissions totales de CO2. Aujourd’hui, les nations industrialisées, qui ne regroupent qu’un quart de la population mondiale, sont directement responsables de bien plus de la moitié des émissions de gaz «à effet de serre», cause du réchauffement de la planète.

<p>
Or, la situation pourrait être différente d’ici cinquante ans. La contribution des nations en développement risque de dépasser celle des nations industrialisées dès le milieu du 21e siècle par suite de leur développement économique et de leur croissance démographique. Néanmoins, leur contribution par tête d’habitant restera bien inférieure à celle du Nord. Cette répartition des responsabilités passées et potentielles ont amené les nations industrialisées à s’engager à fournir l’aide financière et à procéder aux transferts technologiques requis pour que les nations en développement puissent mieux limiter leur contribution future au problème.

<H3>Qui est le plus vulnérable ?</H3>

Par ailleurs, les nations présentent des degrés de vulnérabilité variables face au changement climatique et à la hausse du niveau de la mer. La vulnérabilité dépend de l’ampleur des changements environnementaux auxquels est confronté une nation, de ses circonstances particulières et des ressources disponibles pour soutenir les stratégies d’adaptation.
<p>
La hausse du niveau de la mer représente une menace directe pour les trois quarts de la population mondiale qui habitent les basses terres proches des côtes. Nombre d’importantes agglomérations, d’installations portuaires et d’industries, ainsi que d’abondantes terres arables fertiles sont situées dans des zones littorales et tout impact aura d’immenses retombées au plan social et économique.
<p>
M. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, président des Maldives, fut un des premiers dirigeants politiques à attirer l’attention de la communauté internationale sur la menace potentielle du changement climatique. Il a répété maintes fois que si on n’agit pas de manière à ralentir le réchauffement de la planète, son pays pourrait littéralement disparaître sous les flots.
<p>
Créée pour représenter les intérêts des nations vulnérables durant les négociations de la Convention-cadre, l’Alliance des petits États insulaires (APEI) y a joué un rôle important, mettant en lumière leur situation unique et soulignant la responsabilité du monde industrialisé. Elle a formulé une proposition novatrice, consistant en un «fond commun d’assurance» servant à indemniser les pays vulnérables des effets néfastes de la hausse du niveau de la mer, et vient d’élaborer un projet de protocole préconisant d’assigner aux nations développées des objectifs plus ambitieux.

<H3>Les engagements pris au titre de la Convention-cadre</H3>

La Convention déclare qu’il serait souhaitable que les nations industrialisées stabilisent leurs émissions au niveau de 1990 d’ici l’an 2000. Ceci prouverait que «les nations développées montrent l’exemple quand il s’agit d’altérer des tendances à plus long terme (...) conformément à l’objectif de la Convention.»
<p>
La stabilisation des émissions pour l’an 2000 équivaut en fait à un témoignage de bonne foi, nécessaire pour qu’à un stade ultérieur, les pays en développement s’engagent quant à eux à limiter la croissance future de leurs émissions. Mais on sait par ailleurs - et en cela réside une certaine ironie - que le résultat de la stabilisation des émissions de carbone dues aux grandes nations industrialisées n’est guère différent de ce à quoi on risque d’aboutir de toute façon, même en l’absence d’action concertée de contrôle des émissions.
<p>
Par conséquent, une forte pression s’exerce en faveur de l’adoption d’un objectif plus ambitieux. Ainsi, le projet de protocole élaboré par l’APEI exige des nations industrialisées qu’elles réduisent leurs émissions de 20 % par rapport au niveau de 1990, d’ici l’an 2005 - proposition qui sera discutée lors de la première conférence des parties contractantes.
<p>
Il est peu probable que l’on fixe des objectifs de contrôle pour les nations en développement dans un proche avenir. Elles n’en ont pas moins l’obligation d’élaborer et de publier - sinon de mettre en oeuvre - des plans nationaux composés de mesures pour restreindre l’accroissement des émissions et sont tenues, à cette fin, de dresser l’inventaire de leurs émissions. Comme les autres parties à la convention, les pays en développement doivent également :
<ul>
<li>coopérer au développement, à l’application et au transfert des technologies de limitation des émissions ;
<li>promouvoir la gestion durable des puits et des réservoirs réservoirs de gaz carbonique (forêts, océans, etc.) ;
<li>préparer, en collaboration avec d’autres, leur adaptation à l’impact du changement climatique et à la protection et à la réhabilitation des zones touchées par la sécheresse et la désertification ;
<li>entreprendre l’évaluation des impacts écologiques de politiques et de projets susceptibles d’affecter le changement climatique ;
<li>promouvoir la recherche scientifique et technique et dans d’autres domaines et y collaborer, en pratiquant un échange sans restriction de toutes les informations pertinentes ; et agir pareillement en matière d’éducation, de formation et de sensibilisation du public.
</ul><p>
Des initiatives diverses ont été prises par les institutions compétentes des Nations unies et par d’autres organismes, afin de soutenir la participation des pays en développement à ce processus. On ne peut encore savoir si elles suffiront à assurer une réaction effective du Sud.

<tr><td><center><h4>A-T-ON AFFAIRE À UNE SCIENCE EXACTE ?</h4></center>
L’effet de serre est en lui-même un processus physique bien établi. Des gaz tels que le gaz carbonique permettent à l’énergie du soleil de traverser l’atmosphère sans aucun obstacle mais retiennent la chaleur près de la surface terrestre. En l’absence de ces gaz dits «à effet de serre» naturellement présents dans l’atmosphère, la terre serait plus froide d’environ 30° C. L’inquiétude suscitée par le changement climatique repose sur trois grandes constatations.
<p>
Premièrement, la concentration des gaz «à effet de serre» dans l’atmosphère a connu une augmentation spectaculaire au cours des trois derniers siècles, phénomène dont l’activité humaine est la principale cause.
<p>
Deuxièmement, la température de la planète a augmenté de 0,5° C pendant les 100 dernières années, réchauffement qui correspond aux prédictions des modèles climatiques basés sur l’évolution de la composition de l’atmosphère.
<p>
Troisièmement, la théorie climatique prévoit, grâce à des projections informatiques, une hausse sans précédent de la température mondiale et du niveau de la mer au cours des prochaines décennies, ce qui aurait des effets considérables sur la situation de l’humanité.
<p>
Pour l’instant néanmoins, les prédictions des scientifiques trouvent leurs limites dès qu’il s’agit d’envisager en détail l’impact du réchauffement de la planète. L’incertitude scientifique est en elle-même une composante importante du problème de l’effet de serre.
<p>
Le fait qu’on ne dispose actuellement pas de prévisions immuables, limite les options actuellement disponibles pour traiter ce problème. C’est pourquoi il est recommandé d’entreprendre des actions préventives en attendant l’amélioration des connaissances scientifiques.

<H3>Qui seront les payeurs ?</H3>

La question du soutien financier a tenu une place cruciale lors des négociations de la convention sur le climat, la position de nombreux négociateurs du Sud étant qu’ils ne s’engageraient pas à prendre des mesures de limitation du réchauffement de la planète tant que le monde industrialisé ne prendrait pas en charge les frais supplémentaires encourus.
En principe tout au moins, cette position a été acceptée et un mécanisme financier a été établi afin de couvrir les suppléments de coût dus aux mesures appropriées. Ce fonds pour le climat est géré provisoirement (mais sans date-limite) par le Fonds pour l’environnement mondial (FEM).

Parmi les projets en cours dans le domaine climatique et financés par le FEM, on relève des travaux sur : l’énergie éolienne au Costa Rica ; l’énergie géothermique aux Philippines ; l’énergie photovoltaïque à usage communautaire au Zimbabwé ; l’amélioration de l’efficacité de la consommation énergétique au Mexique ; la réhabilitation des terres au Bénin et au Soudan ; et le remplacement de gazoducs en Chine. La convention oblige les nations industrialisées à soutenir les efforts en ce domaine des pays en développement :
<ul>
<li>grâce à un financement «nouveau et supplémentaire» permettant aux nations en développement de respecter leurs obligations conventionnelles ;
<li>en apportant leur assistance à ceux des pays en développement signataires qui sont particulièrement vulnérables aux effets défavorables du changement climatique, afin qu’ils puissent financer leurs frais d’adaptation ;

La Convention souligne l’importance de la collaboration entre nations pour faire face au problème du changement climatique. Étant donné que le rapport coût-efficacité de la réduction des émissions varie d’un pays à l’autre, on a proposé que, dans le cadre d’une «comptabilité des réductions d’émissions», les nations du Nord puissent être «créditées» si elles financent l’adoption de mesures de contrôle dans les pays en développement (ou dans d’autres pays développés).
<p>
Ce processus, dénommé mise en oeuvre conjointe, a été mis en question au point de vue de la responsabilité, de l’équité et de l’obligation de rendre compte. Il est probable qu’on fera prochainement l’expérience d’une phase-pilote de mise en oeuvre conjointe.
<p>
Les critères retenus pour sélectionner les projets de mise en oeuvre de la phase-pilote seront au programme de la première conférence des parties contractantes. Il est jugé indispensable d’adopter des critères précis et d’assurer un suivi et une évaluation efficaces.

<H3>Relever le défi</H3>

Le monde de l’aide au développement a un rôle crucial à jouer pour que la Convention-cadre soit effectivement mise en oeuvre. Le Comité intergouvernemental de négociation n’ignore pas que le financement disponible à travers le FEM pour appuyer cette mise en oeuvre - environ deux milliards de dollars sur les trois prochaines années - n’est rien par rapport aux fonds fournis par les organisations de développement du monde entier. À titre de premier pas vers la mise en conformité avec les exigences de la Convention-cadre, il est demandé actuellement à ces organisations de rendre compte des aspects de leurs dossiers en cours ayant trait au problème du climat.
<p>
À ce jour, peu ou pas d’organismes s’occupant de développement ont intégré des mesures concernant l’effet de serre à leurs réflexions stratégiques sur le développement durable. Dans ce milieu, en effet, on accorde une importance mineure à l’éventualité de changements climatiques, par rapport aux autres problèmes écologiques. Cette situation ne saurait guère surprendre, puisque la question du climat ne figure que depuis peu à l’ordre du jour international. De plus, la menace à long terme d’un réchauffement de la planète amène à poser des questions difficiles au sujet des priorités à adopter dans une situation où les ressources sont limitées. Quelle est, enfin, la signification réelle d’une action préventive dans un contexte d’adaptation au changement climatique ?
<p>
Il n’y a pas de réponse facile. Selon un courant d’opinion qui émerge, la meilleure façon de progresser consisterait à aborder le conflit apparent entre les priorités de développement à court terme et la protection du climat à long terme en «intégrant la dimension climatique» au processus de développement, plutôt que de traiter le changement climatique comme thème distinct.
<p>
Lorsqu’il s’agit de s’adapter à ce phénomène, l’intégration de la dimension climatique suppose le repérage des zones vulnérables au changement climatique ou à la hausse du niveau de la mer du fait de problèmes sociaux, économiques ou écologiques actuels. Cela implique aussi d’accorder la priorité aux actions de réduction de cette vulnérabilité. Cette approche «gagnant-gagnant» aura des avantages immédiats tout en limitant la menace du réchauffement de la planète.
<p>
Elle offre également l’opportunité d’examiner la durabilité des stratégies actuelles de développement à la lumière de l’inquiétante perspective du changement climatique à long terme. D’autres notes d’information de cette série traiteront des implications pratiques de cette approche.
