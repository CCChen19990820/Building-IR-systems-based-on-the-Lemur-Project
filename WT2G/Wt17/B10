<p>
A generation has passed since the Nixon administration established racial quotas in hiring, promotion, college admissions, and government contracting. Affirmative-action policies, both public and private, have opened many economic and educational opportunities for Afri-can Americans, and have played an important role in one of the most encouraging developments of recent decades: the emergence of a large and growing black middle class. But supporters of government-mandated racial preferences have always been uncomfortable about policies that judge Americans by the color of their skin, not the content of their character—the opposite of Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream. Even if racial preferences have been justified on a temporary basis, they surely cannot be justified for more than a generation.<p>
Citizens and politicians are beginning to roll quotas back. Senators Bob Dole and Phil Gramm both have promised that, if elected president, they would repeal President Nixon's executive order requiring all government contractors to submit detailed "goals and timetables" for the hiring and promotion of minorities and women. Governor Pete Wilson has abolished some racial hiring quotas established by California law. Even President Clinton is reviewing the issue. <p>
Perhaps the most dramatic movement is the California Civil Rights Initiative, which will be on the ballot next year and enjoys overwhelming support in public-opinion polls. The brainchild of two scholars, Glynn Custred and Thomas Wood, the initiative is based on the color-blind language of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: "Neither the State of California nor any of its political subdivisions or agents shall use race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin as a criterion for either discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual or group in the operation of the State's system of public employment, public education or public contracting."<p><center><b>Gaining Ground</center></b>
<p>
There are six reasons why the repeal of government-mandated racial quotas is gaining the support of the American people:<ul>
<li>
Racial preferences are discriminatory. It is just as wrong for the government to discriminate in favor of blacks and other minorities as it is to discriminate against them. Preferring one race to another is a violation of the Declaration of Independence, which holds that all men are created equal; of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees all citizens the equal protection of the laws; and of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which explicitly forbids government-mandated reverse discrimination. This discrimination has real victims, such as the Asians denied admission to the University of California in spite of spectacular records, and would-be policemen and firemen who lose jobs to applicants who are substantially less qualified.<li>
Racial preferences violate the principles of American citizenship. Americans come from all races, all religions, all nationalities. What unites us as a nation is not a common origin, but a common commitment to our political institutions: the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; the Constitution; a self-governing republic. Martin Luther King Jr. brought Americans together—by speaking of what Americans have in common, by showing how the civil-rights movement fit into the American political tradition. Racial preferences do the opposite; they balkanize our country by emphasizing our differences.<li>
Racial preferences foster dependency on government. Ronald Reagan used to say that "the success of welfare should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of welfare." So, too, the success of affirmative action should be judged by how many businesses become independent of set-asides, by how many individuals become independent of quotas in promotion and hiring. Unfortunately, all too many businesses have become part of a permanent affirmative-action industry.<li>
Racial preferences restrict freedom. Much of the creativity of a market economy comes from the freedom that individuals and businesses have to discover and use information. Bureaucratic, highly regulated affirmative-action policies endanger this creativity by denying businesses the freedom to hire and fire whomever they wish, and, in the case of employment tests that are forbidden because they have a disparate impact on races, by interfering with the free flow of information.<li>
Racial preferences fail to address the central challenge facing black America today: integrating poor black males into the American mainstream. The number of black men in college has fallen behind even as affirmative-action preferences in college admissions have intensified: There are now only 540,000 African-American men in college, compared with 830,000 black women. The explosion of violent crime by young black men wasn't supposed to happen with affirmative action. Something drastically different must be done instead of racial preferences, or a generation of black men will be destroyed.<li>
Most perniciously, racial preferences lower standards and expectations. When African Americans and Hispanics are held to a lower standard than members of other groups, the implicit message is patronizing, even racist. The signal sent by different treatment is that African Americans and Hispanics cannot compete on their own, unless they are given a special handicap. To make matters worse, the very idea of standards is devalued in the culture of affirmative action, where a test is considered discriminatory if blacks and Hispanics don't score well. </ul>
<p>
It is no accident that the two institutions in which blacks have advanced the most rapidly in America, the military and athletics, are meritocracies with clear performance standards. Colin Powell did not become the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and one of the outstanding generals in American history by receiving special treatment in his performance reviews. The military, it is frequently said, is the only institution in America in whichblacks regularly give orders to whites. This is because blackss in the armed forces have been given standards to aspire to, and the opportunity to achieve them.<p>
By contrast, public schools in America set tragically low academic expectations for poor children, especially for blacks and Hispanics. The culture of affirmative action reinforces these low expectations, with a defeatist message that minorities can't make the grade, and that standards don't even really matter. The sad fact is that on average blacks and Hispanics do score poorly on standardized academic tests. But that isn't an indictment of the tests; it's an indictment of the school system and surrounding culture that discourage kids from achieving.<p>
The literature of education is filled with stories of rapid academic advances by blacks and Hispanics in the face of higher expectations. Over the objections of fellow teachers and guidance counselors who said "these kids can't learn," Jaime Escalante turned Garfield High School, located in a working-class Mexican-American neighborhood of East Los Angeles, into one of the country's top advanced-placement calculus schools. Black and Hispanic freshmen in Georgia Tech's engineering program outperform whites, thanks to a rigorous orientation program based on immersion in math and chemistry.<p>
In New York City, the number of black ninth-graders passing the New York State Regents' science exam doubled from 6,000 in 1994 to nearly 13,000 in 1995, while the number of Hispanics passing the test tripled from 3,000 to over 10,000. The difference? In 1995, at the insistence of New York City School Chancellor Ramon Cortines, black and Hispanic students were expected to take Regents-level science courses and succeed in them. Prior to that, they were expected to fail.<p>
Expectations make all the difference for modest levels of achievement as well. During the early 1980s, Florida established a functional literacy test as a criterion of high-school graduation. Florida schools now give diplomas only to students who pass a test measuring whether they can fill out basic job application forms, do basic kinds of comparison shopping, balance check books, and otherwise participate in a modern society. At first, 80 to 90 percent of black 12th-graders failed. The test was challenged in court by the Legal Services Corp. on the grounds that it was discriminatory. But Florida gives students five chances to sit for the exam, and 90 percent of black 12th-graders now get passing scores. Those graduates are much better off for being forced to achieve a minimum level of competency.<p><b><center>The Best Affirmative Action</b></center>
<p>
The best affirmative action offers opportunities to outsiders without lowering standards and expectations. This means holding the members of all races to the same high standard and, if necessary, giving people the extra training they need to make the grade. It means not reserving particular jobs for blacks. It means making a genuine effort to find African Americans—and other Americans of all races—who might be overlooked but who have the capacity to excel. This is frequently a judgment call, for the capacity to excel is determined by leadership ability, strength of character, intellectual creativity, and other attributes that can't be easily measured by standardized tests. Precisely because it is a judgment call, it does not lend itself to bureaucratic oversight in the form of quotas, goals, or timetables.<p>
The nomination of Clarence Thomas as associate justice of the Supreme Court is a wonderful example of this judgment. President Bush and his advisers sensed that Thomas, though he did not yet have much judicial experience, had the constitutional understanding, the moral courage, and the intellect to become a distinguished judge—and also to become a national hero among conservative blacks in the way that Justice Thurgood Marshall was a national hero among liberals. As a result of Thomas's race, President Bush may have looked at his qualities more closely than he otherwise would have at that stage in the judge's career. But it was Thomas's qualities, not his race, that led to the nomination. There was no lowering of standards. On the contrary, the  Thomas nomination is now seen, at least by conservatives, as Bush's most significant enduring domestic-policy achievement.<p>
Americans of all races can take pride in the growing leadership of African Americans in political, economic, and cultural life. It is one of the great success stories of American history, rivaling the stories of the pioneers, of immigrants, of inventors and entrepreneurs. It is a quintessential American story of determined people overcoming hardship to make the most of our blessings of liberty.<p>
Government-imposed racial preferences played an important part in this story, by smashing through the institutional barriers to black advancement that were the legacy of centuries of discrimination. But reverse discrimination was always a questionable remedy to earlier prejudice. By failing now to offer opportunity to poor black males, racial preferences have outlived whatever usefulness they may have had. It is time for them to go.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT></B>uring the coming year, Americans will begin a serious debate over the meaning and value of affirmative action. Among the early signs:
	<P>	A proposed ballot initiative in California aims to amend the state constitution to 
prohibit preferential treatment in public policy based on race, sex, ethnicity, or national 
origin.</P>
<P>	In Georgia, the state legislature considers a bill to end preferences for women and 
minorities in landing county contracts.</P>
<P>	Senator and presidential hopeful Phil Gramm (R-TX) promises that, if elected, he 
will end major set-aside programs on his first day in office.</P>
<P>	President Clinton orders an "intense, urgent review" of all aspects of government 
affirmative-action policy. Veteran Democratic strategist Susan Estrich says that as far as 
affirmative action is concerned, "now is truly the time to move on to some other 
approach."</P>
<P>	The Supreme Court may oblige her. In agreeing to hear Adarand v. Pena, the 
Court threatens to reform, restrict, or undo federal set-asides for minority-owned 
businesses. Policy Review asked several black businessmen to describe the impact of 
race-based government contracting on entrepreneurship, and to offer their own insights 
into establishing successful businesses in an increasingly competitive market. Here are 
their stories:

<H3>Ward Connerly</H3>
<P>	Of all the terms used to describe America, none is more descriptive (and it is my 
favorite) than "the land of opportunity." Opportunity, the chance to advance in life, is the 
centerpiece of our value system. It is this concept that separates us from the rest of the 
world. For opportunity to have meaning, there must be entrepreneurs, people who are 
willing to take chances in order to succeed. True entrepreneurs are created not by 
government, but by God, and their natural talents are stimulated by the marketplace.</P>
<P>	In recent years, our nation has begun to debate the effects and consequences of 
"affirmative action." Affirmative action comes in many forms; some are acceptable, even 
desirable, such as advertising the availability of contract opportunities in minority 
communities, and adopting strong measures to ensure that racial and gender 
discrimination have no place in our society.</P>
<P>	Other forms of affirmative action, however, are very damaging to the nation and 
to those whom such programs and practices are designed to benefit. One of the most 
odious forms of affirmative action is the concept of awarding contracts on the basis of 
racial, ethnic, or gender preferences. There are many variations on this theme, but the 
approach taken in California is fairly representative and instructive.</P>
<P>	Several years ago, the California state legislature passed a law requiring every 
state agency to award 15 percent of all contracts to firms owned by minority business 
enterprises (MBEs), 5 percent to firms owned by women-owned business enterprises 
(WBEs), and 3 percent to firms owned by disabled veterans (DVBEs). Minorities are 
defined as "socially and economically disadvantaged" groups and include blacks, 
Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans.</P>
<P>	What are the effects of this policy?</P>
<P>	First, the prospect of getting government contracts, as a result of belonging to a 
protected group, is sometimes a false inducement for people to go into business without 
being adequately prepared to be in business. They often are undercapitalized and lack the 
business acumen to remain in business without government contracts. This is not itself a 
sin, but these businesses tend to become an extension of the government agencies 
themselves. Consequently, the agencies often create contract opportunities to sustain 
these businesses rather than acting to meet their needs or those of the taxpayers.
<P>	Second, the costs and headaches associated with administering the MBE and 
WBE programs are significant. A bureaucracy of MBE/WBE coordinators has been 
established in virtually every department of California's state government. This 
obviously increases the cost of government and creates enormous inefficiencies for 
companies that do business with the state. There is great inconsistency across 
departments, and many officials confess that their programs cost more because of these 
set-aside requirements.</P>
<P>	Third, these practices are marginalizing better-established businesses because they 
are forced to share their contracts with MBE/WBE partners. Few businesses can sacrifice 
23 percent from a contract and still make a profit. I hear the argument that 23 percent is 
not being taken off the top, but rather the total pie is merely being sliced differently. 
Sometimes that is true. Our firm, however, is usually able to carry out most portions of 
our contracts. Yet we must often create a role for those whom we are required to include. 
This generally means subcontracting for tasks that we could perform ourselves at lower 
cost. Whenever we take on a state contract, we lose profit, and our private-sector clients 
bear the burden of our higher prices.</P>
<P>	After 22 years in business, I know that government procurement of goods and 
services is less costly when the specifications are clear and private contractors are able to 
fit these requirements into their methods of doing business. Whenever contractors have to 
customize their methods of delivering products, such as aligning themselves with new 
partners, the cost on a per unit basis of doing business inevitably rises.</P>
<P>	Fourth, the quality of the work sometimes suffers. When you are forced into a 
shotgun relationship with firms with whom you do not regularly do business, it is 
inescapable that you lose some management control over the project.</P>
<P>	Fifth, the policy invites deception. For example, there is evidence that some 
women or minorities listed as "owners" exercise no control over the day-to-day 
operations of their businesses. In some instances, the so-called owner rarely sets foot on 
the premises. How is the goal of equality advanced when, say, a man who has owned a 
construction business for decades suddenly switches ownership to his wife?</P>
<P>	Finally, these set-aside programs are blatantly unfair. Consider my own business. 
I own 50 percent of the stock issued by my company. My wife owns the other 50 percent. 
Technically, neither of us "controls" the business, and we qualify for neither MBE nor 
WBE preferences.</P>
<P>	We have chosen not to change the ownership of our business merely to qualify for 
preferences based on my race or her gender. But why should we operate at a competitive 
disadvantage just because we prefer to be considered on the merits of our work? How 
does society benefit when a business established 22 years ago, by individuals who were 
willing to risk their economic futures, is disfavored in order to lure others to go into 
business?</P>
<P>	Minority set-aside programs are creating all kinds of dysfunction in the 
marketplace, they are unfair, and they are based on the false proposition that government 
should be creating business opportunities for women and minorities. What government 
should be doing is ensuring, through advertising and other forms of outreach, that 
opportunities are equally available, and then allowing the marketplace to produce the 
lowest legitimate bids for the goods and services that the government seeks to procure.</P>

<B>WARD CONNERLY <I>is president of Connerly and Associates, Inc., a Sacramento-based 
consulting firm. He serves on the University of California Board of Regents and recently 
testified in favor of the California Civil Rights Initiative.</I></B>

<H3>Daniel Colimon</H3>
<P>	I operate perhaps the largest black-owned litigation-support firm in California. 
We have been in business for 14 years, and our clients include at least 200 law firms from 
Santa Barbara to San Diego. We have never sought a government contract as a minority 
firm, and federal set-asides for awarding contracts to minority-owned businesses anger 
me to no end.</P>
<P>	After our firm did some work for the legal department of a state utility, one of its 
officials told me that if we became a certified minority enterprise, they would make us 
their primary vendor. There was no discussion of the quality of our work--none 
whatsoever. </P>
<P>	They merely needed to rack up points with the state's Public Utility Commission, 
which requires all state agencies to do at least 15 percent of their business with minority-
owned companies.</P>
<P>	I said no. Commission officials called me every other week for two and a half 
months. They warned that if we continued to refuse, they would simply opt for another 
vendor. They did, and I have since lost 80 percent of their business.</P>
<P>	It is time for America to acknowledge that affirmative action doesn't work. There 
are fatal flaws in set-aside programs, which, despite all of the good intentions, hope, and 
government intervention, have produced very few positive changes. If anything, the white 
"backlash" to affirmative action has perpetuated the polarization of America's various 
ethnic groups.</P>
<P>	If affirmative action was to be the vehicle by which we travel the road to racial 
equality, somewhere along the way we lost first the keys and then the map. If affirmative 
action was to redress past discrimination against African Americans and other racial 
minorities, it has failed miserably:</P>
<UL><LI>  White males dominate the social, political, and business landscape as never before.<BR>
<LI>  Racial minorities are still largely absent from the private sector's management or 
executive boardrooms.<BR>
<LI>  Worst of all, affirmative-action programs have established an extremely damaging 
stereotype that places African Americans and other racial minorities in a very precarious 
position. We are perceived as a group of people who--regardless of how hard we work, 
how educated we become, or what we achieve--would not be where we are without the 
preferential treatment afforded by affirmative-action programs.</UL>
<P>	Throughout my life, I have been taught that the best place to look for help is in the 
mirror. I grew up poor and  black and  in a single-parent household. I graduated from a 
predominantly white university. I have worked since the age of 12. I founded an 
extremely successful litigation-support firm that employs people of all races.</P>
<P>	Although I have suffered with the burden of being a businessman who happens to 
be black, never have I been given nor have I expected preferential treatment simply 
because I am black. I defy anyone to put an asterisk next to any of my accomplishments. I 
have always demanded that I receive respect, not by virtue of what I am, but of who I am. 
Conversely, I have always accorded the same treatment to all I have encountered, 
regardless of race, creed, or national origin.</P>
<P>	My personal experiences with affirmative-action programs, in the business 
community and outside it, have all been negative. It is not popular to be black and 
opposed to affirmative action. When discussing this with other blacks, I've been told that 
I have sold out to the white agenda. On the contrary, I argue that we don't need any 
affirmative-action programs precisely because I believe so strongly in my capabilities and 
those of all people of all races.</P>
<P>	Such programs are not the solution to America's race problem. Truly 
"affirmative" action should take the form of equal-quality education, which will help lead 
to equal political access and equal economic opportunity. Additionally, it is imperative 
that we acknowledge the existence of institutional racial discrimination. Rather than 
disavowing responsibility for it or wasting 25 years on programs that have not worked, 
we should aggressively ferret out those who practice clear discrimination and prosecute 
them. </P>
<P>	Only then will we truly be able to say that we have equal opportunity. The 
measure of this will be a society where people can achieve success regardless of race,  
where people "will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their 
character."</P>

<B>DANIEL COLIMON <I>is the chief executive officer of Law-in-Motion, Inc., a Los Angeles-
based litigation-support firm.</I></B>

<H3>Herman Cain</H3>
<P>	When Pillsbury Co. hired me as president of Godfather's Pizza, one of its failing 
subsidiaries, we  couldn't count on a government contract to revive the chain. Not only 
did we want to rescue the chain from debt and looming bankruptcy; we wanted to have 
the industry's highest average sales per unit and the highest average profitability per unit. 
You don't get that without a commitment to quality and an acute sensitivity to your 
market.</P>
<P>	When Ronald Gartlan and I later led a team of other managers to buy Godfather's 
Pizza, we didn't use a set-aside program. We had to fight and defend and sell the banks 
on our merit as investors. Our success or failure was based on our own raw business 
ability.</P>
<P>	If there were no federal programs to assist minority business owners, the 1 percent 
of businesses owned by the black community would probably be zero. But federal set-
asides are a double-edged sword: Any time you have a guaranteed participation level, you 
may not have the same incentives or the same motivation to perform as in a situation that 
is driven by performance. On the other hand, without set-asides, many minorities 
candidates for contracts, jobs, or services would not even be considered for inclusion.</P>
<P>	Remember, you need capital to start a business. The lack of access to capital is the 
number one reason for the tiny percentage of black-owned businesses. Set-asides do not 
address the capital issue as it relates to starting, maintaining, and running a business.</P>
<P>	One of the most important aspects of being successful is relationship-building. 
The vendor and the customer have to develop a relationship based on trust and 
performance. But you can't legislate relationships; set-aside programs won't build 
relationships between minority businesses and their customers.</P>
<P>	As a businessman and as a black American, I know there still exists institutional 
racism, which tends to exclude people from consideration. As a result, I've practiced 
several principles to help me achieve my goals:</P>
<UL><LI>  Because I am a black American, I've had to perform better than my white counterparts. 
This is a personal standard that I've set for myself: I've got to perform a little better in 
order to get the same opportunity. I can't just be as good; I've got to be better. It should 
not be this way, but it is.<BR>
<LI>  When I come across those barriers, such as racial bias, I have to let my performance be 
my barrier buster. That's just the price you pay for success.<BR>
<LI>  I have to maintain focus and be tenacious in achieving my objectives.</UL>
<P>	I have been very successful in corporate America because I have refused to allow 
any of the normal obstacles--and there have been many--to stop me. Part of my success 
is linked to getting an opportunity, but another part is taking advantage of the opportunity 
by staying focused. That is something you can't legislate or put in a program.</P>
<P>	When I came to Godfather's, I sought the views of the management, the 
operations people, and the franchises on how we got into the mess we were in and how 
we could get out. By focusing on our strengths and on the market niches where we could 
win, we embarked on a path to recovery. In just over a year--and against intense 
competition--store sales increased about 10 percent, with some restaurants running as 
high as 25 percent. More important than the numbers, however, is the fact that over the 
last several years we have built a foundation for sustained profitability.</P>
<P>	I'm a firm believer that we are put on this earth to make a difference. I happen to 
have been blessed in that I have achieved some business success. But what's truly 
important to me is that I'm able to use the position, compensation, and incentives that go 
along with business success to help make a difference in other people's lives.</P>
<BR>
<B>HERMAN CAIN <I>is the president and chief executive officer of Godfather's Pizza, with 
more than 525 restaurants nationwide. He is the current president of the National 
Restaurant Association.</B></I>

      George Bush last year vetoed a so-called "civil rights" bill
because it would encourage employers to adopt racial quotas in
employment decisions. A revised version of the bill, called the "Civil
Rights Act of 1991" (H.R. 1), was introduced this year and already has
passed the House of Representatives, although with less than the two-
thirds majority needed to override the President's promised veto. The
House rejected an alternative bill offered by Bush. 
<P>
      Attention now has turned to the Senate, where Senator John
Danforth, the Missouri Republican, has introduced a "compromise" civil
rights bill (S. 1745). As in the House, the Senate debate has focused
on the issue of whether the legislation will promote quotas. Danforth
insists that it will not. Yet while Danforth has made significant
changes in his bill since it was first introduced this summer, it
remains a quota bill.
<P>
      What Is A Quota Bill? In its original, narrow usage, the term
"quotas" referred only to the practice of setting aside a fixed number
or percentage of employment positions for members of a particular
race, color, religion, sex, or ethnic group. In recent debates over
civil rights legislation, however, the term has come to be used for
all forms of race-conscious decision-making or preferential treatment
based on group membership, including such terms as "goals" and
"timetables." The term "quotas" also refers to laws that force
employers to abandon perfectly legitimate hiring practices simply
because they happen to produce statistical disparities between the
racial or ethnic composition of an employer's work force and that of
the general population. This broadened definition is more in line with
the commonly understood idea of a quota. Thus, a policy of giving job
applicants an advantage in the hiring process merely because they are,
say, black or Hispanic, would count as a quota, as would a policy of
always choosing a minority whenever two applicants are otherwise
equally qualified.
<P>
      A bill can fairly be classified as a quota bill if its effect
would be to give an employer the incentive to adopt quotas to protect
himself from potential lawsuits based on the percentage of minorities
in his work force. Or it would be a quota bill if it changes the rules
of civil litigation to make it impossible for victims of employment
discrimination to challenge quota plans adopted by employers under
court order or in settlement of prior litigation. It is in these two
senses the Danforth bill qualifies as a quota bill.
<P>
      Avoiding Disparate Impact Suits. Current civil rights law allows
individuals to sue an employer over legitimate and nondiscriminatory
hiring practices if these practices happen to produce a racial or
ethnic mix in the employer's work force that is different from that
found in the general population. A statistical disparity between the
racial or ethnic composition of an employer's work force and that of
the general population is called a "disparate impact." The Danforth
bill would alter the standards in disparate impact suits, making it
more likely that employers will lose in court, and more expensive for
them even when they win. This would encourage employers to try to
avoid being sued in the first place by giving special preferences to
groups that otherwise might be under-represented in the employer's
work force. 
<P>
      Two changes the Danforth bill would make to current law are
especially harmful:
<P>
      First, once a plaintiff has demonstrated that particular
employment practices used by an employer cause a disparate impact,
Danforth's bill would shift the burden of proof to the defendant
employer, requiring him to show that each of the challenged practices
is "required by business necessity." This change represents a radical
departure from previous law. Putting the burden of proof on the
defendant is contrary to the tradition of Anglo-American law, under
which a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty: the burden
of proof is on the plaintiff, not on the accused. The change proposed
by Danforth also is contrary to the customary practice in other kinds
of civil rights cases, and in virtually all other areas of civil
litigation. Since defendants accused of intentional discrimination do
not have to prove their innocence, it would be odd and perverse to
require defendants who are accused merely of getting their work force
numbers wrong -- perhaps inadvertently -- to prove theirs.
Nonetheless, that is exactly what the Danforth bill would do. 
<P>
      This change alone would create pressure for employers to adopt
quotas. Not only would putting the burden of proof on defendants make
it more difficult for them to defend themselves against disparate
impact suits, but it would make it almost impossible for defendants to
obtain summary judgment and thereby avoid the expense of a trial. (A
court may decide in favor of a party without first holding a trial if,
based on those facts which are not in dispute, one party is entitled
to prevail as a matter of law.  Such a ruling without trial is called
a summary judgment.  It generally is harder for the party having the
burden of proof on an issue to obtain a summary judgment on that
issue.) Consequently, even if an employer were completely confident
that he could show the business necessity of his hiring practices at
the trial, often it would still be cheaper simply to change the
practices to produce the "right" mix of employees, and thereby avoid
being sued in the first place.
<P>
      Second, and of even greater concern, the Danforth bill would
change the standard for deciding whether an employment practice that
causes a disparate impact is "required by business necessity." The
current standard is based on whether a challenged practice serves a
legitimate employment goal of the employer in any significant way. The
new standard would require that challenged hiring or promotion
practices bear what the bill calls a "manifest relationship" either to
the performance of the "actual work activities required" by the job,
or to any other "behavior that is important to the job" in question.
The differences between the current standard and Danforth's proposed
new standard may appear to be slight. However, there are many
legitimate employment practices and goals which, under Senator
Danforth's formulation, would be treated as forms of racial
discrimination. 
<P>
Example:   An employer who requires all his employees, including
           janitors, to have a high school diploma could be found
           guilty of racial discrimination because the possession of a
           high school diploma does not bear a manifest relationship
           to the job of sweeping floors. This means that attempts by
           local businessmen to encourage local teenagers to finish
           high school by favoring high school graduates for
           employment almost certainly would be ruled illegal. 
<P>
Example:   An employer who prefers to promote from within the
           organization might face legal problems. Many employers
           believe that such a policy is good for employee morale, or
           believe that on-the-job observation provides a more
           reliable basis for choosing upper-level employees than a
           one-hour interview. Such employers thus might require
           certain entry-level employees to have skills and
           educational credentials above those necessary for the
           entry-level position. But under the Danforth bill such an
           employer could be found guilty of racial discrimination
           since the additional requirements would not bear a
           sufficient relationship to "the employment in question."
<P>
Example:   An employer who uses a test to determine which employees
           should be promoted to a higher position that requires
           special training could be found guilty of racial
           discrimination if he is unable to show a sufficient
           statistical correlation between performance on the test and
           performance in the job in question. It may be that the
           verbal and analytical skills evaluated in the test would
           indicate an employee's capacity to understand the material
           in the training program, and mastery of such such material
           may be indispensable to successful performance of the job.
           Nevertheless, these facts by themselves might not be a
           sufficient legal defense.
<P>
      The standard in the Danforth bill would require employers to
defend their hiring and promotion practices exclusively in terms of
performance of work activities required by, or other behavior
important to, the job in question. Thus, employers would be forced to
abandon employment practices and goals not directly related to the job
in question. Yet many employment practices and goals not directly
related to the job in question may be legitimate and sensible. For
example, given the already dismal state of American education, it
would seem absurd for Congress to punish employers for requiring high
school diplomas. Indeed, employers are being urged by Congress and the
Administration to encourage prospective employees to finish high
school. Moreover, regardless of whether an employment practice or goal
is socially desirable or not, the fact that it may not be directly
related to "the job in question" does not automatically make it a form
of racial discrimination. 
<P>
      With the restrictions that the Danforth bill would place on the
acceptable justifications an employer can offer in defense of a policy
that happens to produce a disparate impact, many employers would
conclude that offering a defense is not worth the cost. Instead
employers would seek to avoid being sued in the first place by
altering their hiring procedures to produce the "right" mix of race
and sex within their work force. In other words, they would adopt
quotas.
<P>
      There is another aspect of the Danforth bill that, by itself,
also would be sufficient to make the bill a quota bill. The measure
would restrict severely the right of individuals harmed by quotas or
other race-conscious "remedies" imposed by consent decrees or other
court orders to seek redress through an anti-discrimination lawsuit of
their own. For example, if an employer who is sued agrees to give half
of all promotions to blacks, or is ordered to do so by a court, better
qualified Asians or Hispanics might subsequently be denied promotions
because of the new quota. But under the Danforth bill, these workers
could be denied their day in court if they wished to challenge this as
unfair. This denial of due process and civil rights thus would lock in
quotas by protecting such a hiring policy from subsequent challenge.
<P>
      Proponents of this legislation, including Danforth, repeatedly
have called for a compromise. What they refuse to recognize or
acknowledge is that the Administration's alternative bill already is a
compromise bill. In fact, Bush already has gone farther than is
prudent in trying to compromise on the issue of quotas. Even his bill
would shift the burden of proof on the issue of business necessity to
defendants. The undesirable effects of this departure from the normal
presumption of innocence would be reduced greatly, however, because
the standard of business necessity in the President's bill is less
restrictive than that in the Danforth bill or in H.R. 1.
<P>
      Missing the Real Issue. Perhaps the greatest weakness of the
Danforth bill is that it focuses exclusively on making arcane,
legalistic refinements in the civil rights laws that were passed a
quarter of a century ago. Like H.R. 1 and last year's Kennedy-Hawkins
bill, the Danforth bill overlooks the fact that civil rights laws are
irrelevant to the most pressing problems facing America's neediest
individuals. Like its predecessors, the Danforth civil rights bill
mainly would benefit middle- and upper-class minority Americans who
have the education and skills to benefit from de facto quota hiring.
Because low-income minority workers tend to work in the kinds of jobs
in which, if anything, they are already over-represented, they would
not be particularly affected by the bill. Where employers would have
to make changes to reduce their exposure to litigation is in the
middle- and upper-level job categories, in which minorities tend to be
"under-represented." The only minority workers who can occupy these
jobs, however, and thereby benefit from any increase in the demand for
minority employees, are those with higher skill levels. Relatively
underprivileged or unskilled minority workers would not be able to
take advantage of increased opportunities the bill might create, and
the bill would do nothing to help those who lack necessary skills to
acquire them. At the same time, by saddling employers with another
layer of employment laws and regulations, imposing additional
administrative costs and litigation expenses, the bill actually might
tend to reduce employment opportunities for the neediest minority
workers. Thus, while the Danforth bill might increase the salaries and
employment prospects of minority engineers and doctors, it would do so
at the expense of high school dropouts struggling to climb up the
employment ladder.
<P>
      Empowering Minorities. A more forward-looking civil rights
agenda instead would create real economic opportunities for
minorities. Reduced taxes on low-income Americans and on businesses
would create more job opportunities. Removing government restrictions
and high taxes on small - and medium-sized enterprises in the inner
cities, through enterprise zones, would promote business creation in
areas where there are high concentrations of disadvantaged Americans.
And allowing parents to choose the schools to which they send their
children would help ensure that future generations of poor and
minority Americans are qualified for the best jobs. Such empowerment
strategies would improve the employment opportunities of disadvantaged
workers. Quotas would not.

<title>Why the So-Called "Civil Rights" Bill Would Still Mean Quotas -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3> WHY THE SO-CALLED "CIVIL RIGHTS" BILL WOULD STILL MEAN QUOTAS </h3>
By  William G. Laffer III<BR>
       McKenna Fellow in Regulatory
                         and Business Affairs<BR>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 302<br>
June 3, 1991<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p> 

     George Bush last year vetoed a so-called "civil rights" bill
because it would encourage employers to adopt racial quotas in
employment decisions. This year's version of the bill, the "Civil
Rights Act of 1991" (H.R. 1), was introduced in the House by
Representative Jack Brooks, the Texas Democrat. Again there is a
debate over whether this legislation promotes quotas, and again the
proponents of the legislation claim that it does not. By the end of
last week, the bill had seen several revisions, each an attempt to
allay the fears that the bill is a quota bill. Yet there are still
solid grounds for such fears. It is still a quota bill that deserves a
presidential veto.
<P>
     Useless Provision. The latest version of H.R. 1 ostensibly would
prohibit the use of quotas. Its definition of a "quota" is so narrow,
however, and it has so many loopholes, that the provision would be
useless. While employers would supposedly be prohibited from setting
aside a fixed number or percentage of positions for people of a
particular race, color, religion, sex or national origin, they would
be free to engage in other forms of preferential treatment. Example:
Employers could give job applicants extra credit on employment tests
for being black or Hispanic, and could adopt a policy of always
choosing a minority whenever two applicants are otherwise equally
qualified. Moreover, an employer could use quotas as long as everyone
hired met the minimum necessary qualifications to perform the job. And
while it might be illegal for an employer to fire a department head
for failing to meet a hiring quota, the employer could make department
heads' bonuses, raises and promotions contingent on achieving quota
targets.
<P>
     Current civil rights law allows individuals to sue an employer
over legitimate and nondiscriminatory hiring practices if such
practices happen to produce a racial or ethnic mix in the employer's
work force different from that found in the general population. This
is called a "disparate impact." Section 102 of H.R. 1 would alter the
standards in disparate impact suits, making it more likely that
employers will lose, and more expensive for them even when they win.
This would encourage employers to try to avoid being sued in the first
place by giving special preferences to any groups that might otherwise
be under-represented in the employer's work force. 
<P>
     Among the changes H.R. 1 would make:
<P>
1)   It would not require plaintiffs to identify the specific
     employment practices that produce a disparate impact. Under the
     current language of the bill, all a plaintiff would have to do is
     to allege that all of the defendant's employment practices taken
     together produce a disparate impact. The burden of proof would
     then shift to the defendant to identify which of his employment
     practices, if any, actually produced the disparate impact, and to
     show that every one of these practices is "required by business
     necessity" -- an enormously difficult, if not impossible, task.
<P>
2)   It would change the standard for deciding whether an employment
     practice that produces a disparate impact is "required by
     business necessity." The current standard is whether a challenged
     practice serves any legitimate employment goals of the employer
     in any significant way. The new standard would require that
     challenged practices bear "a substantial and manifest
     relationship to the requirements for effective job performance,"
     thus making the standard much more difficult for employers to
     meet.
<P>
3)   It defines its standard of business necessity solely in terms of
     "effective job performance," thereby precluding consideration of
     other nondiscriminatory factors that can legitimately bear on
     employment-related decisions. For example, if a manufacturer were
     to close an unprofitable plant with a high percentage of minority
     workers, and the workers whose jobs were eliminated were to
     challenge the plant-closing decision based on its disparate
     impact, H.R. 1 would require the manufacturer to defend its
     decision solely in terms of the affected workers' performance,
     attendance, punctuality, and so on -- even though such factors
     had nothing to do with the closing, and even though the real
     reason clearly was non-discriminatory.
<P>
     Many employers almost surely would conclude that defending
against disparate impact suits simply is not worth the effort and
would instead alter their hiring procedures to produce the "right" mix
of race and sex within their work force. That is, the employer would
adopt quotas.
<P>
     Ignoring Provisions. Even if the anti-quota language in H.R. 1
were to prohibit any form of racial preference, it would not change
other aspects of the bill which create powerful incentives to promote
quotas in the first place. Several sections of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, meanwhile, already prohibit quotas; yet the courts have
generally ignored these provisions. And if the H.R. 1 anti-quota
provision were effective, it would put employers in an impossible
situation: They could be held liable if they failed to adopt quotas
and their work force happened to become imbalanced, but they also
could be held liable if they used quotas in an effort to keep their
work force numbers in line. 
<P>
     In addition, Section 104 of H.R. 1 also would restrict severely
the right of individuals harmed by quotas or other race-conscious
"remedies" imposed by consent decrees or court orders to seek redress
through an anti-discrimination lawsuit of their own. Thus, for
example, if an employer is ordered by a court to give half of all
promotions to blacks, better qualified Asians or Hispanics who are
denied promotions because of the new quota could be denied a day in
court. The real point of Section 104 is to lock in quotas by
protecting them from subsequent challenge. 
<P>
     Despite its revisions, emendations and explanations, H.R. 1
remains a quota bill. It thus still deserves a presidential veto.

<title>Ending Judicial Dictatorship – Heritage</title>

<h3> ENDING JUDICIAL DICTATORSHIP</h3>



<b>By Patrick J. Buchanan</b>
<p>
Delivered January 29, 1996 at <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, Washington, 
D.C.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	All just powers, Thomas Jefferson wrote in the 
Declaration of Independence, derive from the consent of the governed. Governments are 
republican, he later said, "in proportion as they embody the will of the people and execute it."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But in America today, the power that stands astride 
this country like a colossus is not the power of the majority; it is not the power of the governed; 
it is the power of the judiciary. The Supreme Court, not the majority, decides what is right or 
wrong in America. The Supreme Court has final say on criminal justice, education, voting, 
employment and promotion, taxation, immigration and deportation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In these areas, as in all others, the majority can pass 
a law or make a proposal, but it is always up to the Court to make the final decision. It may find 
a "constitutional right" and decide the majority's plan violates it: End of majority plan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To revise Lincoln's words, we today have a 
government of the judiciary, by the judiciary, and for the judiciary.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Now, someone must determine what a child will 
learn, how a criminal shall be treated, and what kind of society we will live in. Who shall it be? 
The judiciary -- or the majority?
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Traditionally, in America, middle-class families 
controlled most of the things central to their welfare. They decided them at the state and local 
level -- education, crime, spending, taxation, public health and welfare, including abortion. The 
values of the governed prevailed because, if government officials weren't responsive, they were 
kicked out of office.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As the judiciary takeover took hold, however, the 
power to throw the bums out became almost pointless because elected officials had less and less 
power. The middle class had lost the ability to control the things that mattered to it. Its power had 
been taken away from it by the Supreme Court. The Court centralized power in Washington and 
exercised that power without democratic consensus. Led by the Court, the country set off on a 
30-year experiment with non-democratic government.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We get one kind of society when decisions are made 
by the majority. We get another kind when decisions are made by judges, what Jefferson called 
the "despotism of an oligarchy."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The majority has never asked government to do 
anything brilliant or unusual -- just educate a child, defend the nation, and keep the streets safe. 
Civilized society had been doing those things for a long, long time, and we were even doing 
them at reasonable cost, in the much-maligned 1950s. But the Court took them over and made 
itself morally answerable for the safety and welfare of the nation. And the things the Court took 
over in working order do not work any more.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today the values of the Supreme Court determine 
all the issues that make up the quality of life. Unfortunately, the values of the Court differ 
markedly from those of the governed.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Court, by the mid-1960s, began a long period 
of active opposition to the wishes of the majority. Since then, the Court has been in the vanguard 
of an intellectual elite that believes that the prevailing social order of middle-class America is 
deeply flawed, unjust, and irrational.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Traditionally, the Court's function was to decide 
cases, to interpret the law, to supervise the lower courts, and on rare occasions to declare a 
federal or state law unconstitutional. But look at how far the federal judiciary has gone.
<p><ul>
<li> In 1958, the Court ruled that prayer, commonplace in American public schools, was now 
unconstitutional. All prayer, Bible instruction, and even the posting of the Ten 
Commandments was henceforth forbidden.
<p>
	<li> In 1973, the Supreme Court declared that women had a constitutional right to an 
abortion, a right undiscovered by the men who had written the Constitution or any of the 
greatest of the jurists who interpreted it over two centuries.
<p>
	<li> In 1974, Judge Arthur Garrity ordered the integration of Boston's public schools 
through court-ordered busing. Result: violence, boycotts, racial animosity. Instead of 
integration, Judge Garrity produced a school system where 80 percent of the students are 
minority Americans.
<P>
	<li> In 1987, a Kansas City federal judge ordered a doubling of property taxes and a 25 
percent increase in income taxes to pay for improvements in the public schools.
<p>
	<li> In 1988, in Yonkers, Judge Leonard Sand imposed stiff and escalating fines, nearly 
bankrupting the city, because its elected officials refused to vote as the judge had 
demanded on a plan to put low-cost housing in white neighborhoods.
<p>
	<li> In 1995, the Supreme Court threw out term limits on congressional delegations in 23 
states.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What we have here is gross usurpation of power by 
federal courts, which are using that power to rewrite laws to conform with the Court's idea of 
what is just, fair, and right. What the Founding Fathers intended to be the weakest branch of the 
federal government has become the most powerful: The Supreme Court has become a 
superlegislature.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Court's new role is as adversary to the people.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	By defining "individual rights" as it wished, the 
Court has centralized control over every moral, political, social, and economic issue in the 
country. The Court says it is acting on behalf of a higher authority, the Constitution, but in fact 
the Supreme Court has twisted and reshaped the Constitution -- as Jefferson said -- as an artist 
shapes a ball of wax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Court today derives its powers from its own 
will and is not subject to correction or reversal. It has become the one branch of government on 
which there is no check, and for which there is no balance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Judges, Justice William Brennan wrote in the 1979  
decision, "are not mere umpires, but, in their own sphere, lawmakers." In 1985, Justice Brennan 
told a Georgetown Law School audience that the "Majoritarian process has appeal under some 
circumstances, but I think ultimately it will not do." Justice Brennan added: "Faith in democracy 
is one thing, blind faith quite another." The Court's role, he said, is "to declare certain values 
transcendent, beyond the reach of temporary political majorities."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Court freely uses all the coercive power of the 
state to enforce its orders. One rule binds al l-- either there will be school prayer or flag burning 
or term limits or pornography, or there won't be -- and if it is not the majority's rule that prevails, 
as it is in a democracy, it is the minority's.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The minority, because of the Court's intervention, is 
no longer just protected; it is put in control. However, the Court, despite the use and threat of 
force, has not settled anything. Race relations are worse than they were. Abortion is a sorer issue 
today than when the Court took control of it in the 1973 decision,   . Force cannot bring about a 
democratically sustainable solution to the culture wars.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Criminal conduct, to the Court, became a form of 
self-expression, a statement of social protest and criticism. The Court orders that taxpayers must 
provide lawyers for criminal defendants who cannot afford to pay for one. The Court routinely 
overrules the actions of local police, of boards of education, and the state laws under which they 
act.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Who are the beneficiaries of the Court's protection? 
Members of various minorities including criminals, atheists, homosexuals, flag burners, illegal 
immigrants (including terrorists), convicts, and pornographers. In December 1994, the month 
after 59 percent of California voters approved Proposition 187 limiting social welfare benefits 
available to illegal aliens, a single federal judge prohibited state and local officials from 
following the new law. California taxpayers continue to support the illegals as the case drags on 
in the federal courts.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But this is only the tip of the iceberg of judicial 
dictatorship in America.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Court's power flows to economic as well as 
social and cultural issues. Since it interprets the antitrust laws, the Court determines the amount 
of competition in the country. The laws, which Teddy Roosevelt intended to protect small 
business, have been interpreted to favor big business. The Court has also ruled to encourage the 
forces of globalism against American workers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In a 1986 decision, the Court ruled against U.S. TV 
manufacturers -- when we still had some -- and in favor of their Japanese competitors. The 
Japanese conceded they had conspired to raise profits in Japan but denied they did so to bankroll 
a predatory pricing conspiracy in the United States to drive our manufacturers out of business.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Court agreed with the Japanese that no trial to 
find the facts was necessary. According to the Court, the Japanese had no "plausible motive to 
engage in the conduct charged." The Japanese, the Court said, "had no rational motive to 
conspire" since it would call for them "to destroy [U.S.] companies larger and better established 
than themselves, a goal that remains far distant."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But not so far distant after the Court's decision: The 
Court, when it could have made a difference, allowed the Japanese to drive the American 
companies out of business. The middle class, which had lost its political clout, was now losing 
its well-paying jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Federal courts today supervise and, in effect, 
administer the operation of the state schools, prisons, and mental hospitals. A consent decree in 
South Carolina requires the state to provide a recreational program for convicts, including 
tournaments in croquet, badminton, paddleball, and backgammon.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in July 1993, prior to 
her confirmation hearings, wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee that federal judges find these 
"chores" to be "uncongenial and unwelcome." Had "state and federal legislatures" done a better 
job, the courts would not have been forced to take over the schools, prisons, and mental 
hospitals. The majority, according to Justice Ginsburg's theory of democracy, gets first shot at 
solving problems to the satisfaction of federal judges. But not the last word.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Court argues that it is the only institution that 
will protect the rights of minorities and prevent the tyranny of the majority. But who thinks the 
majority wants to tyrannize over the minority? The majority changes as the issue changes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Does the country need nine guardians to save us 
from totalitarianism? Can it be saved from totalitarianism by nine guardians? Jefferson thought 
the majority was the only "true guardian" of individual rights. The majority may sometimes err, 
Jefferson said, but "its errors are honest, solitary and short-lived."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Democracies correct mistakes sooner and more 
easily than do other systems. Judges with lifetime tenure, like dictators, do not correct -- or admit 
-- their mistakes. Majority action corrects, as do safety valves on a steam engine.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Jefferson did not see anything in the Constitution 
that gave the Supreme Court power "to decide for the Executive, more than to the Executive to 
decide for them."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Alien and Sedition Laws were enacted by the 
Federalist Congress in 1798 to suppress criticism of the government. The federal courts found 
the laws to be constitutional and convicted and imprisoned newspaper publishers. Upon 
Jefferson's election in 1800, he released every person in jail, or being prosecuted under the laws, 
asserting the law "was a nullity, as absolute and as palpable as if Congress had ordered us to fall 
down and worship a golden image: and that it was as much my duty to arrest its execution in 
every stage, as it would have been to have rescued from the fiery furnace those who should have 
been cast into it for refusing to worship the image."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	How do we reign in an out-of-control Court? It is 
not hard to do; here are several ideas:
<p><ul>
	<li>One, we could appoint judges for a term of years rather than for life. The term could 
be renewed if the President and Senate think they have done a good job. We should not 
delude ourselves that life terms keep judges above the political fray. They have joined the 
fray and, like other politicians, must be held to some accountability.
<p>
	<li> Second, federal judges at the appellate and district court levels could be made 
subject to voter recall and removal.
<p>
	<li> Third, Congress could use its power, granted in the Constitution, to restrict the 
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
<p>
	<li> Fourth, we could do what Teddy Roosevelt recommended in his 1912 presidential 
campaign -- have the nation decide at the next election whether to uphold or reject any 
Court decision creating a new "right" or overturning a state or federal law. "It is the 
people and not the judges who are entitled to say what the Constitution means," said T.R., 
"for the Constitution is theirs, it belongs to them and not to their servants in office."
<P>
	<li> Fifth, we could simplify the way in which we amend the Constitution--to remove 
Congress from the process.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Right now the Constitution requires Congress to 
approve proposed amendments before they can be sent to the states for their consideration. 
Congress, however, obviously won't approve limits on its powers such as are called for in the 
Balanced Budget and Term Limits Amendments. Congress also naturally protects the Court 
because the Court is the source of most of its powers. We should allow the states, without the 
approval of Congress, to amend the Constitution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Any state should be able to propose an amendment, 
and if three-fourths of the states agree to the language, the amendment should become part of the 
Constitution. At the Constitutional Convention, Mr. Madison came close to having such 
authority put into the Constitution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The purpose here is not radical change. It is to put 
an end to radical change being imposed upon a free people by an unelected elite which serves for 
life and is answerable now to no one. It is to restore the original system of checks and balances 
envisioned by the conservative men who wrote the Constitution.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Over the past 30 years, the Court has lost any sense 
of its proper relation to the country and has consequently lost the respect of the people. The 
people's respect will return as soon as the Court returns to its traditional role--an independent 
judiciary acting within a democratic Republic.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Majority rule is not perfect, and a democratic 
Republic will not always be just, or incorrupt, or provide a completely rational social order 
wherein all wants are satisfied. A majoritarian society is imperfect because man is imperfect. But 
it is the faith of the democrat that self-government provides the best way of assuring freedom for 
the individual to live as he wishes, and to develop his talents to their fullest.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In a judicial dictatorship, you get a government and 
society designed by the Supreme Court to conform to its intellectual vision of America. The 
public, however, does not share the Court's vision. With democracy, you get, as Jefferson said, 
not a perfect government, but one as good as the people.

<h3>FIXING THE WAR POWERS ACT</h3><p>

Expansion of remarks (at a Heritage Foundation symposium on May 22, 1995 by Ronald D. Rotunda) by Albert E. Jenner Professor of Law, University of Illinois College of Law.
<P>
In 1973, Congress enacted the War Powers Resolution over President Nixon's veto.1 Supporters viewed the law2 as an effort to prevent another Vietnam, while opponents saw it as an unconstitutional effort to restrict the Commander in Chief while not achieving its  well-intentioned goals.3 The law is now more than 21 years old. Like a young child growing up, it has reached its majority. Since then, liberals, conservatives, Republicans, and Democrats have all attacked the law. Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-ME), for example, has complained that the law simply "has not worked."  It "potentially undermines our ability to effectively defend our national interests" and "unduly restricts the authority granted by the Constitution to the President as Commander-in-Chief."4  Former President Ford agrees, calling the law both "unconstitutional" and "impractical."5  Presidents of both parties have been accused of ignoring it.6 With a pedigree like that, now is a good time to reevaluate the resolution.<p><b>Applicability of the War Powers Resolution</b>The coverage of the War Powers Resolution is broad, encompassing essentially every situation involving combat troops. Like most laws, it is written in the style of the Internal Revenue Code or the Treaty of Westphalia. Its intricate prose states that, unless there has been a declaration of war, the law applies to every case where the President introduces "United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, and to the continued use of such forces in hostilities or in such situations."7  In other words, the law applies to virtually everything.<p>	Declarations of War. The exception for declarations of war means, in effect, that there are no exceptions, because no major power has declared war since World War II. Of course, the intervening years have witnessed major undeclared wars (the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Gulf War are obvious examples), as well as relatively minor ones (e.g., Panama,  Grenada, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia).
<P>
	While our Constitution provides that only Congress can "declare war," the framers of our Constitution specifically rejected a proposal that would give to Congress the power to "make" war.8 Instead, the framers made the President the Commander in Chief, and the decision to seek a declaration of war became a political question for Congress to resolve. A declaration is an escalation of the war effort; in only a few circumstances has Congress taken that symbolic step. It is too late in our history to argue that there can be no war unless the war is officially "declared."  Since our Declaration of Independence, our country has been in about 200 armed conflicts, while we have declared war only seven times. Not even the Civil War, the bloodiest in our history, was a declared war.9<P>	Situations that Develop into Hostilities. The War Powers Resolution also applies to "the continued use of such forces in hostilities or in such situations."  Thus, if U.S. troops are     already stationed in an area where there are no imminent hostilities, but then we are attacked, we have a situation where there is the "continued use of such forces in hostilities or in such situations."<P>	In short, the War Powers Resolution applies to everything that involves hostilities or that develops into hostilities. In our uncertain world, that covers a great deal.
<P>

<b>When the President Can Use Combat Troops Short of a Declaration of War
</b><p>
Three major parts of the War Powers Resolution merit specific emphasis. First, there is section 1541(c), entitled "Presidential Executive Power as Commander In Chief; Limitation."  It states that the President's constitutional power to introduce U.S. combat troops is limited to only three circumstances:  "(1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces."10<p>	This section provides that the President is not allowed to send U.S. troops into combat unless Congress specifically gives advance approval; the only exception is if the President is responding to a national emergency created by an attack on U.S. territory or on U.S. armed forces.11 Even then, the President must report to Congress immediately and then "terminate any use" of the troops within 60 days unless Congress specifically approves of further action.12<P>	Our history demonstrates that there are many other situations where Presidents have the constitutional authority to act. For example, the President may use the military to rescue U.S. citizens abroad, to rescue foreign nationals when that directly facilitates the rescue of our citizens abroad, to protect U.S. embassies abroad, to implement a cease-fire involving the United States, or to carry out the security commitments in a treaty.13 The War Powers Resolution, oddly enough, does not even include the right of the President to deter an imminent attack on the United States. Section 1541(c) only covers the situation where there has been an actual attack!  Professor John Hart Ely admits that "it truly is impossible to predict and specify all the possible situations in which the president will need to act to protect the nation's security before he has time to obtain congressional authorization."14<P>	Over the years Presidents have justified military action without the specific consent of Congress, relying on various theories not found in the War Powers Act.15 President Roosevelt sent troops to Iceland and Greenland in 1940, although federal legislation appeared to forbid it.16 President Johnson initially justified sending Marines to the Dominican Republic to protect U.S. citizens; later Johnson relied on the Rio Treaty. President Clinton involved the military in Haiti without seeking congressional approval.<P>
	After the enactment of the War Powers Resolution, Presidents have simply ignored the strict limits of this section, as illustrated by incidents such as the Mayaguez rescue and the  invasion of Grenada. Moreover, the American people (particularly our citizens abroad) would not want a President to follow this section:  To do that would assure unfriendly      governments and terrorists that American embassy personnel, tourists, and other American nationals abroad are all fair game, unprotected by the world's only superpower. This section should simply be repealed.17<P><b>The Reporting Obligation</b><P>Various sections of the law impose specific reporting obligations on the President. In   general, the "President in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before" introducing troops into imminent hostilities and shall also consult with Congress regularly after the introduction of combat troops.18 The President must also submit a detailed written report to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate within 48 hours after the introduction of combat troops.19<P>	In a democracy, it is essential that the President consult with Congress and the American people and report what he is doing. If the American people are being asked to send their sons and daughters into combat, the President should honestly explain why. Granted, there will be some circumstances when it may be more difficult to report to particular congressional leaders. President Ford, in referring to the evacuation of Danang in April 1975, illustrated the problem:
<P><blockquote>
	Congress was in a congressional Easter recess. Not one member of the key bipartisan  leaders of Congress was in Washington. [H]ere is where we found the leaders of Congress. Two were in Mexico. Three were in Greece. One was in the Middle East. One was in Europe, and two were in the People's Republic of China. The rest were found in 12 widely scattered States of the Union.20<P></blockquote>	On the other hand, the law does not demand the impossible. The requirement of prior consultation only applies if it is "possible" to do so.21 The requirement of subsequent consultation is similar. The law only obligates the President to consult "regularly with Congress" while our armed forces are in combat situations.22 After he introduces troops, he must submit, within 48 hours, a written report to the House Speaker and the Senate President Pro Tempore explaining why he introduced the military, what authorized him to do so, and what is his estimate of the scope and duration of hostilities.23 <P>	 This basic principle is a sound one. The President has the responsibility, in any democracy, to justify his actions to the American people in a candid way. Many of the explanations of our Vietnam policy were not candid, as Robert S. McNamara's recent memoirs acknowledged.24<P><b>Automatic Withdrawal of U.S. Troops and the Legislative Veto</b><P>Section 1544(b) of the War Powers Resolution requires that "the President shall terminate any use of United States Armed Forces" at the end of the 60-day period unless Congress has either declared war or enacted a law specifically authorizing the use of this force.25 In short, if Congress does nothing, within 60 days (or sometimes 90 days), the President must withdraw the troops. As one supporter of the War Powers Resolution explains this provision, "the president's authority to act in emergencies simply runs out in 60 days if Congress does nothing."26<P>	Presidents and Congress have responded to this section by simply ignoring it. (Congress, for example, did not think that the 60-day clock should start running during the naval war against Iran in 1987-1988.27) Yet, its existence remains important. The inelegantly phrased language appears to give the President carte blanche authority for two months without any   serious oversight.28 It also allows the executive and legislative branches to blame each other for failure of will, for exercise of judgement. It obscures blame and muddies responsibility. It is better for people to know where the responsibility lies. Then we will know whom to blame, and to whom we should give kudos.
<P>
	If section 1544(b) were repealed, that would not prevent Congress from making known its view. On the contrary, Congress has always had the power to pass a concurrent resolution indicating its position on a matter. A concurrent resolution is not a law, and thus not subject to presidential veto. While this resolution does not legally bind the President, that does not make it irrelevant. If the President decided to ignore such a resolution, the people would know exactly whom to blame (or to praise) for the involvement of American combat troops. And Congress would make its will known by doing something, rather than by doing nothing. Everyone in Congress would have to stand up and be counted.
<P>
	Section 1544(c) goes beyond the prior section and creates what is known as a legislative veto. It provides that, notwithstanding the previous section, if both houses of Congress, by concurrent resolution, direct that the troops should be removed, the President must do so. This resolution, unlike a normal law, is not subject to presidential veto. Congress has always had the power to impose its will on the President by using its spending power to enact a law to limit presidential action, but a spending law would be subject to presidential veto. Section 1544(c) declares that it is not subject to veto but (unlike a normal concurrent resolution) must be treated the same as a statute.
<P>
	Section 1544(c) is known as a legislative veto because it gives Congress the right to veto presidential action. As such, scholars have concluded that it is unconstitutional ever since INS v. Chadha,29 a 1983 case that invalidated all legislative vetoes.30 While Professor John Hart Ely argues that section 1544(c) is constitutional,31 even Professor Laurence Tribe admits that this section is unconstitutional.32 The only question is whether the existence of this unconstitutional section infects the entire resolution, as some commentators have suggested.33<P><b>The Peace Powers Act of 1995</b><p>The constitutional and policy problems with the War Powers Resolution, and its apparent irrelevance to military hostilities since its enactment, have caused commentators to call for its repeal. That does not mean, however, that it should be replaced with a vacuum. People do want to avoid another Vietnam; they do want to have Congress involved; and they do want to control foreign adventurism by a President too quick to spill American blood.<P>
	Senator Dole (R-KS) and several other Senators have introduced S. 5, the Peace Powers Act of 1995. This bill continues the basic reporting requirements of the War Powers Resolution. It mandates that the President "in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing" American forces into imminent involvement in hostilities.34 The proposed law also requires that the President submit a written report to the House Speaker and Senate President Pro Tempore within 48 hours after introducing or substantially increasing armed forces into a hostile situation. This written report must explain why the introduction of armed forces is necessary, what is the legislative and constitutional authority, and what is the estimated scope and duration of involvement. The President must also supply periodic reports and respond to additional requests for information.35 H.R. 1111, which is a bill that Congressman Dornan (R-CA) and others have introduced in the House, imposes similar    reporting obligations on the President.36<P>	Both bills avoid the unconstitutional legislative veto; both avoid trying to create a definitive list of circumstances where the President can use the armed forces. (Recall that Professor Ely warned that it "truly is impossible to predict and specify all the possible situations in which the president will need to act to protect the nation's security before he has time to obtain congressional authorization."37) Both avoid the situation where Congress    imposes its will by doing nothing, by failing to take action.
<P>
	And both avoid the problem of appearing to delegate to our court system important    questions of national policy. As Dr. Morton H. Halperin has noted, one of the major problems with the War Powers Resolution is that it has led to legal line drawing by the executive branch:  "What you don't need is a legal opinion from your lawyers that you have not yet crossed some line drafted in a statute about how imminent the hostilities are."38<P>	The proposed Peace Powers Act also deals with an issue that Congress never really thought about in 1973:  placing United States armed forces under foreign command. The United States has joined United Nations peacekeeping activities in the past, but it is only in recent times that the President has chosen to place U.S. troops under foreign command. The concern of many people is that foreign commanders may be more willing and ready to spend American blood than to spend the blood of their own countrymen. Just as many    people are more generous when spending other people's money, so also we might expect that foreign military commanders, if given a choice of sending their own troops or American troops in harm's way, will prefer to spill American blood.
<P>
	Consequently, Section 5 of the proposed Peace Powers Act provides that the President may not subordinate any element of the U.S. armed forces to any foreign national unless Congress enacts a law authorizing the subordination, or unless the President makes various findings and reports to various congressional committees. Sections 7 and 8 provide for prior congressional notification of proposed U.N. peacekeeping activities and require the President to identify the source of funding for these peacekeeping operations. These sections rely on Congress's spending power, which historically has been very broad.39<P>	These sections do not put the President in any straitjacket, but are designed to assure  candid consultation with Congress and the American people in matters involving foreign hostilities. In a democracy the people deserve no less. No overzealous President should involve the United States in unnecessary hostilities while avoiding congressional scrutiny. The War Powers Resolution has not worked; let us try something better:  the proposed Peace Powers Act.

<title>Human Rights Treaty Poses Dangers for America -- Heritage</title>

<h3> HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY POSES DANGERS FOR AMERICA </h3>
By Andrew J. Cowin<br>
Jay Kingham Fellow in International Regulatory Affairs <BR>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 361<br>
July 29, 1993<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p> 

Four years after the fall of the Berlin Wall symbolized the fall
of Communism, the Clinton Administration intends to present for
ratification a treaty shelved at the height of the Cold War because of
its embrace of socialist principles. The International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights establishes the rights to
housing, food, a fair wage, paid vacations, health care, and other
expensive benefits. The treaty was signed in 1977 by Jimmy Carter and
has been pending in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee since 1978.
This treaty should remain on the shelf. If ratified, it could become
law and have the same force as legislation passed by both houses of
Congress and signed by the President.
<P>
     The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights was passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1966 with
the support of the Soviet Union and the Third World non-aligned
movement. Presidents Johnson, Nixon, and Ford refused to sign it, but
Jimmy Carter reversed that policy and signed the document on October
5, 1977, as part of his international human rights agenda. In a speech
to the World Conference on Human Rights this June, Secretary of State
Warren Christopher declared that the treaty "constitutes [an]
important advance," which the Clinton Administration views as a
"solemn commitment to be enforced."
<P>
     As a practical matter, signing a treaty laden with economic
rights is foolish. It accepts as a premise that government can create
wealth. If the 75-year communist experiment proved anything, it is
that government gets in the way of producing goods and services.
Abundant health care, housing, and food are byproducts of wealth
created by private individuals pursuing a profit. Even the most hard-
core former communists in Russia and China have come to understand
this.
<P>
     "Supreme Law of the Land." Unfortunately, the treaty may do more
than simply put the U.S. on record in support of bankrupt ideas. These
ideas may actually become part of U.S. law. Article VI, section 2 of
the U.S. Constitution states, "... all treaties made, or which shall
be made, under the authority of the United States, shall become the
supreme law of the land." Once the Senate ratifies international
treaties, they sometimes become the basis for American case law as
practiced in state and federal courts. One factor courts consider is
whether the cooperation of the other signatories is needed to enforce
the agreement.
<P>
     The classic legal example of this involves the 1918 Migratory
Birds Treaty covering the U.S. and Canada. In a landmark case two
years later, the state of Missouri challenged the right of the federal
government to mandate closed seasons and other treaty measures to
protect migratory birds like geese. The Supreme Court, however, agreed
with the argument that the birds were valued both as food and as
destroyers of insects, and that preserving them was in the national
interest. Protecting this interest required the cooperation of Canada.
The Court ruled that the Migratory Birds Treaty was part of federal
law and therefore pre-empted Missouri state law. (Missouri v. Holland,
252 U.S. 416 (1920).) 
<P>
     Another important consideration often taken into account by the
courts is whether the terms of the treaty can be met without spending
federal money. Article I, section 7, clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution
states, "All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of
Representatives." In the case of the International Covenant, enforcing
the right to housing and other economic rights would require the
government to appropriate funds. This cannot be done without
additional legislation from Congress.
<P>
     Based on these considerations, no reasonable judge would conclude
that the International Covenant is meant to apply to domestic law.
However, not all judges are reasonable. For example, in the early
1950s, a state appellate court struck down the California Alien Land
Law solely on the grounds that it conflicted with the human rights
provisions of the U.N. Charter. The state's highest court rejected the
rationale, but upheld the decision based on the U.S. Constitution.
(Sei Fujii v. State, 38 Cal. 2d 718 (1952).)
<P>
     There have been other examples of U.N. documents being cited in
court cases. For example, several courts have cited the U.N. Standard
Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners when deciding cruel and
unusual punishment cases, although none have based their decisions on
that document. (See, e.g., Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976).) And
the Supreme Court in 1963 made a passing reference to the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights to support the right of dueprocess for a
man denied a passport by the State Department. (Zemel v. Rusk, 381
U.S. 1 (1963).)
<P>
     Reading New Meaning. Activist judges use broadly worded documents
like the International Covenant to achieve a variety of social goals.
One such document on the U.S. statute books is the National
Environmental Policy Act. In a recent decision, federal Judge Charles
Richey read new meaning into the broad language of that Act, applying
its provisions for environmental impact statements to the North
American Free Trade Agreement, and thus endangering early ratification
of the agreement by Congress. Ignoring congressional intent, past
practice, and years of judicial precedent, Judge Richey's ruling in
favor of radical environmentalists could cause a foreign policy crisis
with Mexico if it leads to U.S. rejection of the agreement. (See
Marshall Breger, "Trade on Trial: NAFTA in the Dock," Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder Update No. 199, July 12, 1993.) 
<P>
     Clinton's proposal to ratify this treaty ignores centuries of
Western intellectual and economic history, while at the same time
embracing the theories of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. Their ideas
are enshrined in the Soviet Constitution of 1936, written at the
behest of Josef Stalin. It contained many of the rights in the
International Covenant, including the right to housing, education,
medical care, a job, and leisure time. This cynical document
identified rights that were never meant to be granted. For decades,
though, it gave Soviet totalitarian governments the cover that
justified their accumulation of power and property. 
<P>
     For years, legal activists have tried to get American courts to
recognize this concept of economic rights. Generally, the courts have
refused. (See, e.g., Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980) (no
constitutional right of poor women to have taxpayer-funded abortions);
Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56 (1972) (no constitutional guarantee of
free housing).) This could change if courts decide that the
International Covenant is U.S. law.
<P>
     Ratification of this treaty could be a costly disaster. It would
violate the intellectual spirit of freedom and individual liberties
that has characterized America since its founding.

<title>A Case for Principled Judicial Activism- Heritage</title>

<h3>A CASE FOR PRINCIPLED JUDICIAL ACTIVISM</h3><P>
<b>By James L. Huffman </b><br>
May 20, 1993<br>

<P>
Most political conservatives believe in the principle of judicial
restraint.  I share that conviction, but I also believe in judicial
activism.  My purpose today is to make a case for principled judicial
activism.  In the process I will argue that the traditional
conservative doctrine of judicial restraint poses a serious threat to
liberty, and is therefore not consistent with the fundamental
objective of the framers of the United States Constitution.
<P>
     Our Libertarian Constitution. I begin from the premise that the
United States Constitution, even in its civic republicanism, is a
fundamentally libertarian document.  This foundational premise is
critical to my argument, because the case for pervasive judicial
restraint, of the type practiced by the conservatives on the Supreme
Court, is based upon a very different foundational premise.  Their
premise is that the United States Constitution is founded upon
democratic majoritarianism.  Their commitment to this view is drawn
from the recently rediscovered civic republicanism of the framers.  My
libertarian understanding of the Constitution does not deny the
framers' commitment to civic republicanism.  However, I understand
that commitment very differently than do the conservatives on our
Supreme Court.  It should be of no small concern to conservatives that
the understanding of civic republicanism upon which the generally
accepted doctrine of judicial restraint relies is precisely the
understanding of civic republicanism which drives the vast regulatory
agenda of the new administration.  In a different lecture I might
marshall the evidence which supports my libertarian interpretation of
the Constitution and its relation to civic republicanism.  For the
present I will rely upon a concise statement of libertarian, civic
republicanism as expressed by the Anti-federalist Republicus, writing
in the Kentucky Gazette of February 16, 1788:
<P>

 <BLOCKQUOTE> Thus it appears how civil government becomes a substitute
     for moral virtue:  and that instead of infringing the
     rightful liberties of mankind, it tends to secure them:  and
     by this criterion may every government be tried:  that
     government which tends not to secure the lives, liberties,
     and properties of every individual of the community, as far
     as the law of reason would have done, is unjust and
     iniquitous and merits not the name of civil government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     The Philosophy of Judicial Restraint. The highest responsibility
of every federal judge, affirmed by an oath of office, is to uphold
the Constitution.  I do not believe that the philosophy of judicial
restraint, which dominated federal judicial selection during the
Reagan and Bush Administrations, conforms to this high responsibility. 
I believe that the responsibility of a federal judge, to state it in
the language of restraint, is to be restrained in the interpretation
of constitutionally enacted legislation and regulations, and to be
aggressively activist in the protection of individual liberty.  My
purpose is to explain how a judge can justify the role I urge.
<P>
     Much recent Supreme Court case law seems to have had the purpose
of withdrawing the federal courts from essentially political matters. 
This is a good objective, but not when accomplished pursuant to a
philosophy of restraint which leads judges to fail in the performance
of their responsibilities under the Constitution.  In its rush to
avoid participation in politics, the Court has abandoned its
responsibility to uphold the political philosophy of our Constitution. 
Judicial restraint is not a part of that philosophy; it is not a
constitutional end.  It is a means which can serve constitutional ends
only if we understand how it relates to our fundamental political
philosophy.
<P>
     First, we should ask why conservatives would adhere to a
principle of judicial restraint.  Many will recall the oft-quoted
Tocqueville statement that every political issue in America is sooner
or later a judicial issue.  If Tocqueville meant that every political
contest may raise a judicial question, he was surely correct.  If he
meant that every political question is ultimately resolved by the
courts, he was not describing the 19th century federal courts he was
observing.  He would have been correct, however, had he been
describing the mid- and late 20th century federal courts. 
Tocqueville, like so many conservatives today, made the mistake of
concluding that judicial review is inevitably political.  Properly
done, judicial review is essential to the implementation of a
political philosophy.  Improperly done, as it has been for the last
half century, it is a political act itself.  Advocates of judicial
restraint would do well to understand the difference between judicial
adherence to a political philosophy and judicial participation in
politics.
<P>
     Why do conservatives advocate judicial restraint?  Four
traditional conservative arguments for a comprehensive philosophy of
judicial restraint come to mind. 
<P>

First, judicial activism is said to be undemocratic.  The federal
     courts are not democratic institutions.  Their role, the Supreme
     Court seems to say, is to permit the body politic to make its
     choices. 
<P>
Second, it might be argued that judicial activism is unconstitutional.
     It is not the role which the Constitution sets out for the
     courts, and correctly so because the courts are not competent to
     engage in public policy-making. 
<P>
Third, it would be unprincipled for judicial conservatives to be
     activist in light of their long-standing criticism of the
     activism of judicial liberals. 
<P>
Lastly, to take the opportunity to be activist, now that conservatives
     are in judicial power, would only legitimize activism by liberals
     when they come back into power, which they will do if ever they
     manage to meet their own, self-imposed, diversity requirements in
     making new appointments to the federal bench.
<P>
     Except for the last, I do not disagree with any of these
arguments in the abstract.  But I do not believe that they justify the
sort of restraint which the conservatives on the federal courts have
exercised over the last several years.  As to the first three
arguments, I will endeavor to explain in some detail how I believe the
arguments have been misapplied.  With respect to the argument of
setting a precedent for future liberal judges, I would suggest that
they will require no such precedent.  They will take their slice of
the pie when the opportunity arises.  The hope, if there is any, for
influencing future liberals on the court, is to establish a
libertarian principle of judicial decision-making which even they will
not be able to ignore.  Federal courts can insist, in other words,
that liberals respect the meaning of the label they proudly wear. 
<P>
      I believe that conservatives have gone astray in part because
they have framed the issue of judicial review too narrowly.  The issue
is not just who decides, but who decides what?  The fact that we have
committed some issues to the democracy, does not mean that we have
committed all issues to the democracy.  The Constitution recognizes
implicitly that state legislatures retain their police powers and
explicitly that the federal government has enumerated powers.  The
Constitution also limits both state and federal legislative powers. 
The democracy is thus limited and to that extent the judiciary not
only does not intrude upon the democracy when it enforces those
limits, it is constitutionally required to do so.  Those matters which
are constitutionally within the power of the federal and state
legislatures are not the concern of the judiciary and the Supreme
Court is correct in calling for judicial restraint.  But this does not
translate into a constitutional doctrine of judicial restraint on
every issue which might come before a court.
<P>
     The federal courts have a responsibility to determine whether or
not legislative actions are constitutionally within the power of
Congress.  John Marshall settled this question in Marbury, and,
notwithstanding volumes of discussion on the subject in the
intervening years, no one seriously questions the principle today. 
Where does a court look to answer this question?  It looks to the
power-allocating and rights-protecting provisions of the Constitution. 
This question is not to be answered without an understanding of the
Constitution as an expression of political philosophy. 
<P>
      A central point of the work I am currently doing on federalism
is that power allocation is not simply a power struggle between
competing governors, although it is inevitably that.  Under our
Constitution, it is also a careful assignment and division of power
for the purpose of assuring that government serves the interests of
the people who constitute it.  The allocation of power among levels of
government is not an issue in which many people take an abstract
interest.  We are interested in the question only as it affects our
individual and group interests.  One does not value federal power over
state power except to the extent that one will be better served in
some sense by federal power than by state power.  The same can be said
of the separation of powers among the judicial, legislative, and
executive branches.  No one, other than those who occupy the various
positions of power, can have any abstract interest in which branch of
government exercises what powers.  The structure of government has no
end in itself.  The framers of the Constitution did not agonize for
four months about structure because they cared passionately about the
question in the abstract.  Rather they cared passionately about the
lives of those who would be governed, and they understood that the
allocation of power would have great implications for those human
lives.
<P>
     The Presumption for Individual Rights. A court also looks to the
rights-protecting provisions of the Constitution to define the
legitimate power of government.  Because our Constitution contains an
enumeration of these rights guarantees, conservative judges, following
the thinking of Robert Bork and others, have expressed concern about
the judicial creation of rights which are not expressly guaranteed in
the Constitution.  But why should we interpret a libertarian
constitution to be parsimonious on rights?  Of course I need to
convince you that it is a libertarian constitution, but if I convince
you, then you should be persuaded to conclude that perhaps both
Lochner and Griswold got it right.  I do not say, therefore, that Roe
got it right.  That is a much more difficult question in my mind, but
not because of a tension between the rights of the majority to
regulate abortion and the right of a woman to have an abortion, but
rather because of the tension among the rights of the woman, the
fetus, and the prospective father.  Lochner and Griswold were about
the relationship between the individual and the state.  Roe was about
the competing rights claims of individuals.  In the former cases, a
libertarian constitution requires a presumption in favor of the
individual.  In the latter case, libertarian values do not establish a
clear presumptive favorite.
<P>
     We all know well the history of the Bill of Rights and of the
Ninth Amendment.  The Philadelphia framers did not include a Bill of
Rights in their proposed constitution.  Had their proposal been
ratified as proposed, would today's judicial restraintists contend
that the only rights individuals have against the federal government
are those few expressed in Article I, Section 9?  Would the philosophy
of judicial restraint require us to conclude that the Constitution
proposed by the Philadelphia convention provided no protection against
federal intrusions upon free speech, religious freedom, or due
process?   Of course we do have a Bill of Rights, and it includes the
Ninth Amendment.  Does it make more sense to say that the Ninth
Amendment is a truism or an empty vessel than to say it is filled with
the philosophy of libertarianism? 
<P>
      This is not, I would suggest, the position of one who would
rewrite the Constitution.  I believe I stand firmly on the ground of
framer intent.  Without reference to framer intent, or to some intent
other than that of the immediate decisionmaker, we have no
constitution.  Constitutional government is by definition limited
government and limited government requires that the constitution have
anterior meaning.  To accept all Supreme Court interpretation of the
Constitution as the meaning of that document is to abandon framer
intent in favor of the intent of the last court to decide. 
<P>
      But we should not be so naive as to believe that the framers of
the Constitution could somehow have expressed their intent clearly and
without doubt in their language.  We know a good deal about what the
framers valued and sought to accomplish.  There is more than
sufficient evidence that liberty was a central concern, if not the
central concern.  I do not deny that the division between individual
rights and the power of the state to regulate for the promotion of
individual rights is a difficult problem, but it is clear to me what
the judicial posture should be with respect to that issue. 
<P>
      Why should the judiciary defer to the democracy, as Justice
Scalia would have it?  Is the democracy threatened by an occasional
overreaching on the rights side?  Did Lochner or Griswold hamstring
the democracy so that it could not perform its constitutional
functions?  If we are to err, we should err on the side of liberty. 
Who has the power in this business of government?  Do claims of
individual right threaten the survival of the community?  Justice
Holmes once suggested that speech might on some occasions present a
clear and present danger to the survival of the nation, but those
occasions have proven rare indeed.  All the evidence we have before us
in the form of pervasive federal and state regulation demonstrates
that government has no problem aggregating and exercising power. 
Liberty has always been at risk in every society in the world.  If the
courts have any role to play in preserving our constitutional system,
surely it is to side with liberty and the individual.  The executive
and legislative branches of government have done quite well on their
own.
<P>
     The Presumption for Democracy. In an odd sort of way,
conservative judicial restraintists have joined with John Hart Ely in
the belief that judicial review is rooted in the protection of
democracy.  But why this persistent concern about democracy?  No doubt
the courts will and should intervene to halt governmental action that
violates the democratic principle, but do we do it for the sake of
democracy?  Is ours centrally a democratic constitution?  Is democracy
the ultimate goal of our system of government?  Can anyone articulate
a case for democracy that is not rooted in some more fundamental
value?  I think not.  I think democracy is, and, as Martin Diamond has
demonstrated, was in the view of the framers, the least worst form of
government.  Remember, it is American not to trust government.  Not
even democratic government.  Have we forgotten Madison's warning of
the tyranny of the majority?  The risks of tyranny are less in a
democracy than in other forms of government, but they persist
nonetheless.  Who is there to guard against such tyranny but the
courts?  But if the courts adhere to a judicial philosophy the
fundamental principle of which is deference to the democracy, the
tyrannous democracy will go unchecked.  By definition it will not be
checked by the people.  There is nowhere to turn but the courts, and
they, inspired by a simplistic philosophy of judicial restraint, will
have abandoned liberty for democracy and community.  Ironically, the
conservative judges have laid a solid foundation for the communitarian
visions of the new administration.
<P>
     Why is democracy the least worst form of government?  Why is it
the best form of government?  Is there something to be valued in
having 50 percent of the population plus one dictate to the other
members of society?  Is there something mystical about the agreement
of a majority which changes the self-interested opinions of
individuals into the public good?  Or, if you believe that individuals
have a dual capacity as self-interested consumers and public spirited
citizens, do differing opinions of the public good become the public
good simply by the agreement of 50 percent plus one?  I believe that
the reason democracy is the least worst, or best, form of government
is because it comes as close as we can in an extended republic to
permitting individuals control on their lives.  We value democracy
because it is as close as functional government can come to being
libertarian.  Only unanimity would totally satisfy liberty, but in a
society of 280 million we must settle for republican democracy.  We
settle for it not because it has merit by itself, rather because it
serves, as best we know how, liberty.
<P>
     Deciding the Claims of Liberty. The classic formulation of the
problem of liberty is that each individual should have the maximum
liberty consistent with the equal liberty of all other individuals. 
Holmes described this as a shibboleth, but it is not.  It is the
essential challenge of liberty.  When does government regulation
promote liberty and when does it interfere with liberty?  Consider a
D.C.  ordinance which prohibits discrimination on the basis of
hairstyle or dress.  Is this regulation consistent with a libertarian
constitution?  I do not find this case very difficult.  It is quite
clear to me that individual liberty is limited rather than promoted by
the regulation, notwithstanding that an articulated purpose of the
regulation is no doubt to promote liberty. 
<P>
      But we cannot decide every claim of liberty on an ad hoc
balancing in particular cases.  That would be the rule of man (and
woman), not the rule of law.  Our solution to this problem is rights. 
In the case at issue the rights question is whether the employer or
landlord has the right to hire or rent to whom they please or the
prospective employee or tenant has the right to dress and appear as
they please.  A positivist judge may conclude that the D.C.  ordinance
settles the question in favor of the prospective employee or tenant. 
But there is more positive law to be referenced, namely the
Constitution of the United States.  Does the police power of the
state, or in this case the enumerated and implied powers of Congress,
extend to such regulation?  Probably so, under established doctrine,
but it is just possible that we have it wrong, if liberty is our
standard. 
<P>
      But even in cases like this, rights problems are not simple. 
Courts are often faced with competing claims of right and it is the
nature of our system that the judge can seldom cut the baby in half. 
It is one way or the other.  One claimant wins and has the claimed
right.  The other claimant loses and does not have the claimed right. 
The definition and protection of liberty requires the drawing of
boundaries between people.  By deferring to past court decisions which
have permitted the democratic or bureaucratic denial of liberty,
courts violate their obligation to uphold the Constitution. 
<P>
      Feminist theorists like Catherine MacKinnon would have courts
refuse to draw these boundaries in the interest of community and
caring, but to do so, even in the name of democracy, is to abandon the
liberty of the individual to the whims of the state.  Catherine
McKinnon's (and I fear Bill and Hillary Clinton's) vision of the
Constitution is not the vision of the framers.  Perhaps their
communitarian vision is the wave of the future, but it is not for the
President or the courts to amend the vision of the framers.  Until the
Constitution is constitutionally amended, it is for the courts to
insist that the President and the Congress adhere to the vision of the
framers. 
<P>
      Wetlands as Liberty's Battleground. The definition of the
judicial role is much simpler where the regulation in question
purports to be in the public interest.  Section 404 of the Clean Water
Act, which says absolutely nothing about wetlands, has been
interpreted to be a congressionally mandated requirement that the
Corps of Engineers issue a permit before any wetland is filled or
otherwise destroyed.  Is this within the constitutional power of the
Congress?  A federal circuit court said no in the Hoffman Estates
case.  It was a bold act by federal judges; so bold that the circuit
court, acting en banc, withdrew the opinion.  All lawyers learned in
law school that Congress can do anything it wants pursuant to the
Commerce Clause.  Section 404 is a regulation of the navigable waters
of the United States, broadly construed.  A long line of cases
upholding federal regulation of everything from the feeding of
homegrown wheat fed to homegrown cows to the regulation of race
relations in establishments serving nonresident hamburger should make
it clear that the owners of lands with isolated wetlands must comply
with Section 404.  But a federal circuit panel said no, this makes
absolutely no sense.  And we all know they were right, even if the
opinion has disappeared from the Federal Reporter in the name of the
rule of law and judicial restraint.
<P>
     Court of Claims Chief Judge Loren Smith has decided two wetlands
takings cases, Loveladies Harbor and Florida Rock, which are in direct
conflict, most would say, with Supreme Court takings jurisprudence as
expressed in the Penn Central case.  Judge Smith is also right.  Judge
Smith also will probably be overturned, if not in those cases then in
some others.  But Judge Smith might not be overturned, and if he is
not he will have served the interests of our libertarian Constitution. 
He will have had the courage to say that the emperor has no clothes. 
And while abridging the law as interpreted by prior judges, he will be
upholding the rule of law as it must be understood under a libertarian
Constitution.
<P>
     What is the point of the rule of law?  It is to avoid the rule of
man and woman.  Which is to say it is to avoid the rule of the king,
the dictator, the arbitrary judge, and the tyrannous majority.  The
rule of law is about liberty.  We value it because we value liberty
and the certainty which guaranteed liberty provides to human lives. 
To be judicially restrained in the name of the rule of law without
reference to the reason we value the rule of law is to put form over
substance.
<P>
     Our Conservative Judges. Our Constitution is not just a machine
that would go of itself, in the words of Michael Kammen.  If a
machine, it is one with a purpose.  When, while being maintained by
the Supreme Court, it goes of itself to produce results for which it
was not intended, we need a new maintenance crew which will make the
necessary repairs.  The conservatives on the Supreme Court are not
that crew.  They have as much as said (see O'Connor in the abortion
cases) that if the court gets it wrong it will have to stay wrong. 
That is what judicial restraint requires.  But that is not what
liberty requires.  They clearly need some help from below.
<P>
     Part of the problem is that our conservative judges, like all of
our lawyers, are trained in the tradition of Langdellian legal
science.  All will readily proclaim themselves legal realists, but
they will behave as legal scientists, asking only what is the law?  It
is not for the judge to ask what the law ought to be.  That is for
legislators.  But that is for legislators only within their
constitutional domain.  The law ought to be what it was intended to be
and when we have gotten it wrong we should set it right. 
<P>
      Popular Sovereignty, Not Democracy. Liberty is too important to
be sacrificed to an abstract commitment to judicial restraint. 
Deference to democracy is appropriate where the democracy has the
constitutional responsibility.  What the courts should ultimately
defer to is popular sovereignty, not democracy.  There is a
difference.  Popular sovereignty is about individual people having
control, not about the people as some mystical entity having control. 
We have come to associate the term sovereignty only with states in the
general sense of that term.  But sovereignty is said to derive from
the people.  Why?  Because each individual is and ought to be an
autonomous, sovereign entity.  This idea is at the heart of 18th
century social contract theory which was so important to the framers
of the Constitution. 
<P>
      The Constitution is the creation of popular sovereignty, and it
is that to which the courts should defer.  The conservative position,
as expressed by many federal judges, is not neutral.  There are not
neutral principles for judges to hide behind.  When Holmes said in
Lochner that the Constitution does not enact any particular philosophy
he was wrong.  Without a philosophy the Constitution is an empty
vessel.  The conservative, judicial restraint position serves a
particular conception of the Constitution, and I believe it is not a
conception the framers intended.  The judicial restraint of
conservatism is rooted in majoritarianism, not libertarianism.  Even
if one can make a case of framer intention to create a government
which would promote and enforce civic virtue, it cannot be made in the
name of majoritarianism.
<P>
     It strikes me in reading many judicial opinions that one of the
problems with our judiciary is that our judges have too much
experience with the real world.  Judges have served in agencies and in
Congress and have worked in law firms.  They have learned how to solve
immediate problems for their clients and constituents.  But we need a
little of the vision thing, and not just prospective vision.  A little
hindsight would be helpful; there is much to be learned and remembered
from our past.  The ideas debated by Madison and Hamilton and
Jefferson and Marshall are relevant to more than isolated legal
controversies.  They are fundamental to what our society has been and
will become.
<P>
     For Judicial Activism. In sum, my argument is this.  The federal
courts should be restrained in the review of actions which are
constitutionally undertaken by the other branches and levels of
government.  Indeed once the court concludes that government has acted
within its constitutional powers, there is no further role for the
court.  This means there is no room for judicial utilitarianism, ... la
Judge Richard Posner, or for judicial communitarianism, ... la Justices
Douglas, Rehnquist, and Scalia.  But in deciding whether or not the
government is acting within its constitutional powers, as defined by
constitutional definitions and allocations of power and by
constitutional guarantees of individual rights, the courts should be
unabashedly activist. 
<P>
      To illustrate I will return to the takings cases decided by
Judge Loren Smith and now pending before the Federal Circuit.  These
cases involve challenges to the Corps of Engineers's implementation of
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, what has come to be our wetlands
protection statute.  A federal judge might be asked to address several
questions in such a challenge.  1) It might be asked whether the
federal government has the constitutional authority to regulate the
lands in question.  Assuming that the government does have such power,
2) it might be asked whether the government's regulation of the lands
in question is in the public interest in light of the economic uses to
which the land might be put.  Or 3) it might be asked, assuming again
that the government has the power, whether the Corps has properly
delineated the lands in question as wetlands.  Finally, assuming that
the government has the power and has properly delineated the wetlands,
4) it might be asked whether the government action constitutes a
taking of private property.  On the second and third questions,
whether the government has acted in the public interest and whether
the Corps has properly delineated the wetlands, I argue for judicial
restraint.  The courts know nothing of the public interest nor of
wetland hydrology and biology.  On the first and fourth issues, on the
questions of the extent of government power and of the individual
rights limits on government power, I argue that the federal courts
should be aggressively activist. 
<P>
      To defer to the legislature and the agency on the issues of the
extent of and limits on government power, on the grounds of democracy
is to abandon the notion of constitutional government in favor of
something resembling parliamentary sovereignty.  The vast array of
balancing tests to which our Supreme Court has reduced constitutional
law is the inevitable consequence of such deference.  The Warren Court
did it selectively; the Reagan Court has set out to do it on
principle.  The loss of liberty is the price we pay for adherence to
this so-called conservative principle. 
<P>
      There is no point in insisting upon the rule of law if that law
has no regard for liberty.  Rather than adhere to this principled
restraint in the vain hope that a future liberal court will do the
same -- that we will not again go from Lochner to Griswold -- we
should recognize that both Lochner and Griswold had it right.  As has
been said of free speech, liberty is meaningful only if it has
application to those exercises of liberty which we detest.  If
conservatives embrace the liberties of the left as well as those of
the right; if conservatives embrace the rights of free speech and
criminal due process with the same enthusiasm as they do economic
liberties and the Second Amendment, then they will have set a
libertarian precedent which a liberal court will have difficulty
ignoring.  A reliance on libertarian principal will force liberal
judges to recognize the inappropriate activism of their balancing
tests and the unacceptability of their distinction between economic
and personal liberties.
<P>
     The most significant accomplishment of the Reagan-Bush
Administrations has been the staffing of the federal courts with
intelligent judges.  My fear is that the Reagan revolution will come
to nothing as these judges sit on their hands in the name of a
simplistic theory of judicial restraint.  It is a theory which accepts
majoritarian tyranny as a constitutional requirement.  James Madison
would be dismayed.  The price, as Madison and his contemporaries
warned, will be the continued erosion of liberty.<P>

<p>
Every day, hundreds of travelers and visitors to New York City arrive at 42nd Street, across from Grand Central Station, after a disorienting bus trip from Kennedy or LaGuardia airports. Most of the passengers stepping out onto the sidewalk have a single goal: to find a taxicab. Meanwhile, beside each idling bus awaits another group, equally intent on their own mission: to steal from the disembarking travelers.<p>
These are Grand Central's "bag hustlers," the muggers, swindlers, and con men drawn to the area by the steady stream of bus passengers, as well as by the half-million or so commuters who pass through Grand Central each day. To these men, a confused tourist is like a limping gazelle: slow, defenseless, and tasty.<p>
Early one afternoon, a middle-aged visitor from Austria arrives at 42nd Street. Bags in hand, he scans the street for a cab. Before his eyes can even adjust to the light, he is approached by a bag hustler. The hustler, a stocky man in his late 30s, is confident, aggressive, and talks quickly. He offers to carry the man's bags and find a cab. His $20 fee, he explains, will cover the cost of the ride to the man's hotel. The man assents, unaware that the hustler has no intention of paying for the cab with the $20. Instead, he plans to take the money—and perhaps the man's entire wallet—and run into the crowd.<p>
As the two walk together to the curb, a third man appears, dressed in what looks like a policeman's uniform. "Excuse me," he says to the tourist, pointing to the hustler, "do you know this man?" The tourist, looking confused, shrugs. "Then why is he carrying your bags? He's a thief." Soon, other tourists are looking on, and the policeman repeats his charge to the crowd. "This man is a thief," he says in a loud voice, "stay away from him." The hustler drops the bags, and the cop escorts the now thoroughly confused but grateful tourist to a legitimate taxi stand down the block. In less than a minute, and with little fuss, the policeman has saved the tourist from one of New York's oldest scams.<p>
Except the man in uniform is not a policeman. He is a private security guard, hired by local property owners, and possessing no legal powers beyond those of an ordinary citizen. He is a member of a security detail employed by an organization called the Grand Central Partnership. In less than 10 years, this man and several dozen of his colleagues have helped transform the area around the train station from a chaotic maze of threatening streets into one of the safest sections of Manhattan. They have done it without wholesale arrests—and without the use of public money.<p>
Traditionally, security guards have been employed almost exclusively by businesses: either companies whose assets are so valuable that they require extra protection, such as banks and jewelry stores, or those whose size or physical structure renders police patrols ineffective against crime, like hospitals and railroads. But the role of private security is expanding. Increasingly, civilian guards are providing protection in places where only sworn police officers have walked beats: in public parks, central cities, and residential neighborhoods. And increasingly, the salaries of these guards are being paid not by businesses to protect goods, but by citizens hoping to protect their families and neighborhoods.<p>
The history of private security may be nearly as old as crime itself. The earliest security guards may have been the temple priests in the ziggurat at Ur, enlisted by wary Sumerian moneychangers in the third millennium B.C. to protect their lucrative banking operations. In the United States, where businesses have always assumed a large degree of responsibility for protecting themselves, private security guards predate police departments by more than 200 years. Allan Pinkerton, a Scottish immigrant and barrelmaker-turned-detective, started the country's first guard-for-hire service in 1860. His first job: dispatching uniformed civilians to protect meat-packing plants in Chicago. Pinkerton's company, which by the 1990s had revenues of more than $600 million, now shares the market with about 57,000 other private security firms in the United States.<p>
Private security is among the fastest-growing industries in the country. During the 1980s, security companies expanded at twice the rate of public law enforcement, and received 70 percent more funds. There are now two security guards employed in the United States for every federal, state, and local police officer. Civilian guards protect everything from nuclear-power plants to theme parks to government buildings, and their role in public life is growing larger. <p>
Private security companies can never take the place of police officers, and most do not want to. Security guards lack the moral authority that only government can give law enforcement. They also are hobbled by law. Civilian guards have only limited powers of arrest. In most states, citizens may make arrests only when a crime is committed in their presence; suspicion that a crime has taken place is not enough. And in some states, citizens may only make arrests for felonies, and then must immediately turn the suspect over to a police officer. Even those guards who do see felonies in progress are advised to arrest with caution. Unlike police officers, civilians who accidentally take innocent suspects into custody are liable for false arrest. <p>
For these reasons, security guards cannot routinely respond to violent crime. They cannot interrogate suspects or solve murders or negotiate the release of hostages. But they can augment police efforts, helping to maintain order in places where police forces are absent or spread thinly. And they can encourage citizens to follow community standards in a way police officers often cannot.<p>
Security guards can perform these tasks more cheaply than most police departments. Unlike police officers, guards spend nearly all of their time on the job. Since they seldom make arrests, they have little paperwork, and rarely have to testify in court. They are free to walk their beats, and—of great importance to employers—they accrue little overtime.<p>
Perhaps most important, security guards are flexible. Because they are not required to respond to calls for emergency service, they can go wherever they are needed to deter crime—and stay there. A business owner who fears robberies cannot force a police officer to stand outside the door of his business. But hired security guards can do just that. Private security gives citizens more control over their own safety. Used intelligently, security guards can be as efficient as any police department at keeping public order.<p><center><b>Law and Disorder</center></b>
<p>
By the mid-1980s, the streets of midtown Manhattan seemed to be sliding into chaos. Aggressive beggars clogged filthy sidewalks. Crimes of all kinds were on the rise. Local business owners became increasingly frustrated with the city's apparent inability to clean up the area. Some companies left Manhattan for good. A cluster of midtown property owners decided to stay, and to restore their neighborhood without the help of City Hall.<p>
In 1985, a group of planners led by real-estate developer Peter Malkin formed a "business-improvement district," a primitive form of quasi-government charged with keeping streets safe and clean. The group carved out a 50-square-block area surrounding Grand Central Station and on the cusp of Times Square. They called it the Grand Central Partnership. The owners of the 220 commercial properties within the district got to vote on the plan, and a majority agreed to join. Soon after, the New York City Council approved the plan. Although the area was not physically vast—about 80 acres of streets—it was in the center of one of the densest commercial districts in the country. Once its boundaries were set, the Grand Central Partnership contained more than 6,000 businesses, comprising a total of some 51 million square feet of commercial space, about the same as in all of downtown Los Angeles.<p>
To raise money for improvements, the property owners began taxing themselves, first at the rate of a little more than 11 cents per square foot of space, later at about 12.5 cents. For small businesses, the levy worked out to a couple of hundred dollars in extra taxes per year. For large properties, such as the PanAm building, the tax could add up to $300,000 annually. Collecting the revenue was easy. A state law passed in 1981 allowed the city of New York to gather the money along with municipal property taxes each year. The city then sent the money back to the partnership. The city threatened property owners who refused to pay with foreclosure. <p>
By 1994, the Grand Central Partnership was raising $6.3 million a year in property taxes. Most of the money went to visible projects. The partnership hired more than 30 street sweepers and trash collectors to pick up after the thousands of litterers who walk through midtown each day. It purchased new garbage cans, street lights and flower boxes, and built new sidewalks and gleaming granite curbs.<p>
To help foreign tourists find their way, the partnership hired multilingual guides and placed them outside of the train station. To make catching a cab easier, it built two taxi stands and stationed a guard in each to direct traffic. To make the neighborhood more inviting to pedestrians, the partnership spent $3 million to install 136 high-power halogen floodlights, which illuminate the Grand Central terminal at night. When more money was needed for capital improvements, the group issued $35 million in bonds, the interest on which was paid for by the property tax.<p>
<b><center>Vacating the Vagrants</b></center>
<p>
Completed in 1913, Grand Central Station was crumbling by the 1980s, and had become a magnet for every kind of social affliction. City police seemed unable or unwilling to restore order. In 1987, the New York Times described the area outside the train station as "chaotic and forbidding, often filthy and sometimes dangerous." Much of the chaos and filth, as well as much of the danger, could be traced to the nearly 500 vagrants living in the building. <p>
Since it had no jurisdiction within the train station, the partnership could not make the vagrants leave the terminal. Instead, it decided to lure them away. For years, hundreds of homeless men and women had gathered on Vanderbilt Avenue outside Grand Central to receive food handed out by volunteers. Starting in 1989, the partnership opened a "drop-in center" for the homeless in an old Catholic boys' school a couple of blocks away. Soon, the center was serving meals to hundreds of the same people who had once queued up outside Grand Central.<p>
Inside the old school, the homeless could sit down to eat. And unlike the street in front of the station, the drop-in center was safe, protected by a metal detector and security guards. As additional enticements, the center offered hot showers and job-training classes. Employees of the partnership began to help vagrants living in the train station find more permanent housing, relocating scores of them to shelter at YMCAs and even in city housing. Before long, Grand Central was nearly free of vagrants.<p><b><center>The Shock Troops</b></center><p>
As the partnership's social-service arm enjoyed success with the area's homeless population, its security division worked to assemble a guard force. By the winter of 1988, the security force was ready. Using $1.4 million of its annual revenues, the partnership put 18 uniformed security guards on the street around Grand Central each day, working overlapping shifts from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., seven days a week.<p>
Gerard Panza is a retired detective who runs the day-to-day operations of the partnership's security force. From his office in a building next to the train station, he plots the movement of crime through the district. On one wall hangs a map of midtown, with colored push pins marking the locations of recent crimes. Though the map is riddled with holes, few pins remain, testament to the success of the partnership's strategy for fighting crime. <p>
At times security guards have tackled serious, violent crime. Guards have disarmed a gunman and also foiled an armed robbery. But as Panza explains, the partnership's most important task is keeping the streets orderly. Security guards, he says, have set out to shove even the pettiest of criminals out of the partnership's domain. No public violation of law or exhibition of disorder is too small to merit the attention of security guards. As a result, Panza says, the incidence of crime of all kinds has fallen. <p>
The New York City Police Department agrees. According to the department's statisticians, within two years after the guards arrived, reports of crime within the Grand Central Partnership had dropped by 20 percent. The decline was even more precipitous in the area immediately surrounding the rail terminal. On the western part of Vanderbilt Avenue outside Grand Central Station, a street long famous for muggers and drug dealers, reported crimes dropped 83 percent (from 2,140 in 1988 to 367 in 1990). After three years, reports of crime in the district had dropped 36 percent, an achievement the city's assistant chief of police called "phenomenal." By the spring of 1994, more than five years after security patrol started, reported crime in the Grand Central Partnership had decreased by nearly 53 percent.<p><b><center>A Few Good Men</b></center><p>
The group's directors understood that the guards they hired would do much to shape the partnership's public image. It was a challenging task, because the public perception of private security has never been good. A 1971 Rand report described the "average security guard" as an "underscreened, undertrained, undersupervised, and underpaid" ne'er-do-well with "little education beyond the ninth grade." To this unflattering portrait, the Rand scholars might have added "uncontrollably aggressive" and "psychologically unstable." It is widely believed in the private-security industry that the mentally unbalanced are drawn to guard work. A number of recent, highly publicized incidents in which current and former security guards have committed crimes or gone unaccountably berserk have only seemed to confirm the stereotype. <p>
In order to screen out maladjusted candidates, the Grand Central Partnership advertises the jobs in relatively upscale publications like the New York Times and takes referrals from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. Although no federal laws regulate the hiring practices of private security companies, most states require guards to be at least 18 years old, and to be reasonably upstanding, sober citizens with no recent felony charges. In addition to these requirements, the partnership hires only applicants with a high-school diploma, and gives preference to those with military service. Each recruit is required to take a psychological exam and a drug test. Once they meet these standards, rookie guards are trained for seven days, mostly in the specifics of New York law.<p>
There are no explicit physical requirements for the job, but Richard P. Dillon, who runs the security operation for the partnership, says he likes to hire guards who are "as smart and as big and fast as we can get." In at least one category, it is clear he has succeeded. The partnership's guards—most of whom are men—tend to be physically imposing. Some are huge. The guards do not carry weapons, so physical size can be an important source of authority during an altercation.<p>
Successful applicants are paid well by industry standards. Salaries start at $10 an hour, rising to about $13 with seniority and good service. Benefits include health and life insurance, and two weeks' paid vacation. Once on the force, discipline is strict. Absenteeism and lateness are not tolerated, nor is sloppy dress, smoking in public, or even minor violations of the organization's many rules. Guards must use good manners, including courtesy titles, in their dealings with the public. Their uniforms, which bear a distinct and intentional resemblance to those of the city's police department, are crisp and clean. Under them, guards wear bullet-proof vests. <p><center><b>Tight Supervision</center></b>
<p>
Though they have succeeded in forming a largely professional force, the partnership's directors are under no illusions about the quality of person drawn to guard work, or about what could happen if the guards were managed poorly. Direct and quick communication between guards and supervisors is crucial to ensuring that guards are effective and stay within the bounds of the law. Guards are linked to their supervisors at all times by radios routed through the partnership's dispatching center on 34th Street. As they walk their rounds, guards talk frequently with their overseers, checking in over the radio and seeking approval for any consequential decisions.<p>
The partnership's supervisors are well-equipped to offer guidance. Each is a retired New York City police officer, with a minimum of 20 years on the force. The head of the group's security force, Richard Dillon, was a cop for 32 years before retiring in 1988 as assistant chief of the department. Most other supervisors retired as detectives or inspectors. <p>
Veteran supervisors are the partnership's insurance policy against mishaps. In addition to their superior equipment—each carries a concealed pistol and a radio with a direct line to the police department—supervisors bring a solid knowledge of the penal code. While guards, many of whom aspire to be police officers, are apt to swagger and overstep their authority, supervisors remain cool. William O'Connor, a retired detective who keeps watch over seven guards, says he struggles every day to keep his men within their legal bounds. "They're loaded with enthusiasm, and they would want to do more than private citizens can do." But, as O'Connor reminds his guards repeatedly, they are nothing more than civilians in uniforms.<p>
The distinction is vital. Nothing could destroy Grand Central Partnership's security force more quickly than a guard who assumes police powers and abuses citizens. It has happened before. In the late-1980s, members of the Nation of Islam began providing security to public-housing projects in several cities, including Washington, New York, and Los Angeles. With grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the sect's security firm sent guards into projects to clear out drug dealers. For a time, the group restored a measure of order to the projects. In the process, however, the security guards intimidated not only the drug dealers but residents as well. In a number of housing complexes, police had to intervene to keep the guards under control. In one case, the group lost its contract with a housing project in Los Angeles after being charged with negligence.<p>
In order to avoid similar mistakes, the partnership drills its guards on the limitations on the use of force. Physical force may be used, the guards learn again and again, only as a final resort, in self-defense, or to protect the life of another person. The partnership's security handbook, which explains the limits of civilian authority, is referred to as "the Bible"; guards take refresher courses on it every Thursday afternoon. To further protect themselves from liability suits, guards are required to call their supervisors the moment a problem arises. If the guards make an arrest or become involved in an altercation with a citizen, supervisors routinely interview bystanders as potential witnesses. In the event of a lawsuit, the statements they take may be used to protect the guard. So far, the precaution has not been necessary. The partnership's security force has been sued only once, by a bystander who was injured by a guard chasing a suspect.<p>
The supervisors' broad experience allows them to fill another role as well, that of ambassadors to the city's police. A working partnership between the two groups is vital to the success of the security force, but relations did not come easily. Like most police officers, New York cops are naturally suspicious of security guards, or "square badges," as they are unaffectionately known. In the eyes of police, guards seem to occupy a confusing gray area between public official and private citizen that many cops find disconcerting.<p>
To the surprise of no one, the partnership's guards received a chilly welcome from police when they first arrived in midtown. Due partly to the presence of retired cops in its ranks, however, the guards ultimately developed an amiable relationship with local cops. The two groups now share a substation across from the train terminal, and meet monthly to discuss crime trends.<p><b><center>A Cop's Best Friend</b></center> <p>
Over the years, police have adopted a laissez-faire view of minor lawbreakers around Grand Central, including baggage hustlers, aggressive panhandlers, and small-time marijuana salesmen. "The police are involved with other matters," explains Panza, who spent more than 30 years on the force. "They cannot concentrate on the quality-of-life crimes when they have major crimes. They must first reduce homicides, robberies, assaults."<p>
For police officers, the priorities make good sense. When a cop makes an arrest for disorderly conduct, for instance, he is likely to spend the rest of his shift at the station house filling out forms.<p>
In the meantime, his post out on the streets may remain unfilled, creating opportunities for additional, perhaps more serious crimes to be committed. "That's where we come in," says Panza. "We are the eyes and the ears of the police department. They appreciate our work because we try to solve some problems ourselves, without police intervention."<p>
Guards often go to great lengths to avoid summoning police unnecessarily to the scene of a disturbance. When a knot of marijuana dealers proved especially hard to dislodge, for instance, security guards simply took photographs of the sellers and handed them over to police. Most of the dealers quickly found new retail locations. As in the vast majority of cases handled by the partnership's guards, police never became directly involved. <p>
Of the 6,916 incidents to which the partnership's guards responded in 1994, only 624 required police assistance, and 122 resulted in arrests. That year, guards came across 31 people smoking marijuana in public. In each case, the guards told the smokers to move along, and in each case the smokers did. In cases of narcotics dealing, police were called just 6 percent of the time; in bag-hustling cases, 2 percent; in illegal panhandling cases, 1 percent; and disorderly conduct cases, 9 percent.<p>
In January 1993, security guards told 141 unlicensed peddlers to leave the area. One hundred and thirty-five obeyed the guards without incident. Police were called to handle only six of those cases; only two peddlers were belligerent enough to get arrested.<p>
Most of the time, guards convince violators to comply by explaining which laws they have broken, then politely asking them to leave the area. Most accede. Some do not. <p>
Three-card monte dealers, in particular, have a reputation for ferocity, and only the largest security guards are sent to ask them to vacate the sidewalk. When they are challenged, however, it isn't physical strength most security guards are likely to rely upon, but the power to arrest.<p>
Like all citizens, guards can make arrests when they see crimes committed, hold suspects until the police arrive, and act as complainants in the case against the arrestee. The difference between security guards and most civilians, however, is that guards will, when pushed, actually make an arrest. Most lawbreakers in the area know the guards aren't bluffing.<p>
The threat of even a citizen's arrest is apt to get a wrongdoer's attention. As security chief Richard Dillon puts it, "Criminals, even in New York, where they know they're not going to stay in jail very long, still don't want to be arrested." And, according to Dillon, security guards will make a genuine effort to arrest some criminals. "Our guys chase them five or ten blocks."<p>
When the victims of crime are tourists, security guards make an additional effort to see that the perpetrators are locked up. Visitors from out of town make appealing marks partly because criminals know that even if they are caught, their victims will most likely never return to testify against them in court. The charges will be dropped. To encourage tourists to testify, the partnership authorizes its guards to offer to pay victims' airfare back to New York for the court date. The guards believe this policy makes criminals more inclined to plea-bargain.<p>
<b><center>Deterring Petty Thieves</b></center> <p>
The partnership's guards look strikingly like New York City cops. The resemblance is deliberate. Says Panza, "We want people to think from a distance that it may be a police officer. That is a deterrent. By the time they ascertain that the guy is not a police officer, maybe the opportunity to commit the crime has disappeared." When they are not putting the hustle on bag hustlers, the guards spend their days doing what New York's police department no longer has much time to do: walking a beat and deterring thieves with their uniformed presence. <p>
Coconuts, a music store next to the train station, has lost large amounts of merchandise to theft. Professional shoplifters carry double-walled "booster bags" lined with aluminum to neutralize the store's electronic security system, and they routinely load up with free compact discs and cassette tapes. Store employees, knowing police would be slow to respond, could do little. But the security guards, says Edwin Ortiz, the store's manager, have helped cut down on the thievery. "I call them and they come running and hold the shoplifter till the police come." <p>
Joel Oks, owner of Portabella, a men's clothing store on Vanderbilt Avenue, also had a problem with shoplifters. Now, he says, the thieves have moved on to other areas, along with the drug dealers who used to stand outside his store. The criminals, he claims, have been frightened away by the security guards. "Wouldn't you be scared of this guy?" asks Oks, pointing to Jimmy Mena, a guard the size of a rhinoceros. "We don't have security problems any more. I give them all the credit." <p>
Oks may give the guards credit, but he has no idea how much he gives them in taxes. Like every store owner I surveyed, Oks did not know what he pays each year to the Grand Central Partnership. And like the rest of the owners, he does not seem to care. Whatever the amount, he says, the protection he receives is "well worth it."<p>
Alan Maleh, owner of Goldrush Fine Jewelry at the corner of 42nd Street and Madison Avenue, agrees. "I haven't seen a uniformed policeman around here in years." The guards, by contrast, "are there all the time. If we give a call, they come running over." Before the security guards, he says, "there were no cops." Muggers "would snatch a purse right in front of the store and they would be laughing, not even running away, walking away. They can't do that now. So they go somewhere else." Without guards, he says, "it's like a jungle out there."<p>
Store owners take comfort in the fact they can reach guards at any time on their portable radios and expect an immediate response. Toni Klein, who owns Cohen's Fashion Optical on 42nd Street, says she does not wait for a crime to occur before calling for help. The moment menacing-looking people enter her store, she requests a guard, who invariably arrives in moments. Like many citizens, Klein might feel foolish calling the police to deter crimes before they are committed. But the money she pays to the partnership—even though she is unsure of its amount—makes her feel entitled to preventive police protection.<p><b><center>Fresh Flowers in the Men's Room</b></center>
<p>
Perhaps no location in midtown Manhattan has benefited more dramatically from the presence of security guards than Bryant Park, a nine-acre patch of grass  behind the city's public-research library and adjacent to Times Square. Situated in the center of the city and ringed by office buildings, Bryant Park is a natural place for couples to stroll and office workers to eat lunch. For years, however, few dared enter the area. Until the late-1980s, the park was a dangerous and notorious place: Drug-dealing was rampant, people lived on park benches, and there were murders. <p>
Bryant Park's fortunes began to change when two security guards were assigned to the area. The guards started enforcing some simple rules: no panhandling in the park, no drinking, no drugs, no sleeping on the benches, no feeding the pigeons, and no wading in the fountain. For those who didn't get the message, a sign was hung listing the prohibitions in bold letters. Within a short time, many of the park's seedier tenants left for more hospitable terrain. Soon, law-abiding citizens took the place of vagrants, and the atmosphere  began to change. <p>
Bryant Park now hosts concerts during the summer, and free movies on the lawn every Monday night. There is virtually no serious crime. "We're getting so many good folks here doing so many good things," says William O'Connor, who supervises guards in the park." You're an oddball when you're sitting out there being drunk or disorderly."<p>
Nothing illustrates the revival of Bryant Park more powerfully, however, than the condition of its men's room. By their nature, bathrooms are among the most vulnerable of public spaces. In New York, they are often stark symbols of urban decay. Frequently scarred by graffiti, and filled with drug dealers, amorous homosexuals, and vagrants bathing in the sinks, public men's rooms are places most savvy New Yorkers avoid at all costs. <p>
Bryant Park's men's room, however, is different. Its full-time attendant keeps the room tidy and stands guard. As a result of his vigilance, the men's room is as spotless as the lavatory in an upscale restaurant. Next to the sink is a bouquet of fresh flowers, fragrant evidence of the power of private security to enforce order in public spaces.<p>
More communities are certain to follow the example of the Grand Central Partnership. They may have to. Just as rising medical costs have forced hospitals to give more responsibility to nurses, cities may find that sworn police officers—whom they must train, pay relatively well, and sustain on pensions—are too expensive for fighting and deterring certain types of low-level crimes. To maintain basic civic order, rent-a-cops may be a better deal. <p>
Many communities already think so. In 1993, residents of Georgetown, an affluent and historic neighborhood on the western edge of Washington, D.C., hired a security guard from the Wells Fargo Company. Crimes, particularly thefts from cars, had been increasing in the area for years. About 100 neighbors chipped in approximately $160 a year—about 44 cents a day per household—to hire a uniformed guard to patrol their six-block area. From 6 p.m. to 2 a.m., five nights a week, the guard passes each house in the area at least once every hour.<p>
After a year of employing the guard, residents found their streets transformed. Fresh graffiti stopped appearing on buildings. Burglaries within the six-block area decreased by 55 percent, robberies by 50 percent. The security guard also stopped at least two serious crimes. In one instance, he frightened off two men attempting to kidnap a local couple. <p>
The decrease in crime was so dramatic that other parts of Georgetown soon began hiring guards. Within a year and a half, 90 percent of the neighborhood was covered by security guards.<p>
In the mid-1980s, East Hills, New York, a village of 6,700 on Long Island, hired about 30 uniformed security guards to take the place of sworn police officers. The unarmed guards cruise the streets of East Hills 24 hours a day, reporting crimes to county police, and generally acting as guardians of order. Although the service costs residents an extra $360,000 a year in property taxes, it has remained popular. Local politicians credit the program with reducing the town's burglary rate.<p>
Citizens concerned about disorder in their neighborhoods may find that security guards are the most cost-effective way to make their streets safer. "We don't do homicides, we don't do rapes," says O'Connor of the Grand Central Partnership. "But we do other quality-of-life things. Police are not going to come for an illegal peddler when they're up to their necks in gun runs. That's the reason we're here: We do the work the police have trouble getting to because they're so busy." If the results of these private security firms are any indication, this sort of policing can help restore community life—keeping everyone less busy worrying about crime and more busy building families and neighborhoods.

<B> INTRODUCTION </B>
<P>
     Congress this week will vote on final passage of a crime bill
which purportedly puts 100,000 new police officers on the beat, funds
the construction of new prison space, and directs billions in federal
funds toward "crime prevention." In reality, the bill provides funding
to increase the number of uniformed police officers by only 3 percent
nationwide, places a huge new unfunded mandate on the states, and will
finance an expensive new layer of social welfare programs.
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Specifically, the bill:
<P>
     Guarantees full funding for only 20,000 permanent new cops over
     the next six years, or one-fifth the number claimed by the bill's
     supporters. This is equivalent to adding about one new officer to
     every police department in the nation.
<P>
     Assumes state and local governments will pick up as much as $33
     billion in new expenditures over the next six years if the bill
     is to meet the target of 100,000 officers.
<P>
     Gives the Attorney General the discretion to decide which cities
     and states receive the Community Policing funds. This invites
     handouts to politically connected big-city mayors and
     politicians.
<P>
     Adds at least $8.7 billion in new social spending, and nearly 30
     new social programs, to a welfare system which has cost taxpayers
     over $5 trillion since the War on Poverty was created in 1965.
<P>
     Will put two new social workers on the street for every new cop
     it fully funds.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     In short, the crime bill turns out to promise more cops on
America's streets. In reality, it means few cops, a big tab for
cities, and plenty of new social programs and social workers.
<P>
<B> WHY THE NUMBERS DO NOT ADD UP </B>
<P>
     The most publicized portion of the crime bill is the $8.845
billion Community Policing grant program. The White House claims this
measure will put 100,000 new cops on the street over the next six
years. But a closer inspection of this claim reveals that the figures
simply do not add up.
<P>
     The intention of the Community Policing grant program in reality
is to provide "seed" money to local governments to hire 100,000 new
police officers, not to fully fund these positions. So the bill
assumes that once these new officers have been hired with Washington's
help, state and local governments will find the billions of new
dollars to keep them on permanently. The bill actually provides just
one-fifth of the funds needed to keep 100,000 new cops on the street
for the next six years, leaving the states with the massive cost of
fulfilling the bill's promise. Even worse, the bill allows local
governments to use some of these Community Policing funds for purposes
other than hiring new cops, so there is no guarantee that even 20,000
new officers' positions will actually be funded and cops hired.
<P>
     Based on salary levels for police officers and overhead costs
reported by police departments, the cost of putting one new cop on the
street for one year in a high-crime area is estimated at between
$70,000 to $80,000. (According to the Census Bureau's March 1993
Current Population Survey, the nation-wide average salary for a police
officer is $36,366, and for larger cities the figure is closer to
$40,000. A fiscal officer in the San Francisco Police Department
reported in a telephone interview that the actual cost of putting a
new officer on the street is at least $71,000. Salary and benefits for
this officer are some $61,000 and the cost of recruiting, examination,
and background checks is at least $10,000. Moreover, for every three
new officers hired a typical department must purchase one new police
vehicle. This and other administrative costs are not included in the
above figure. These one-time costs mean the costs of the typical
officer rise to over $71,000. In addition, quotas and other hiring
practices -- which are mandated in the crime bill -- will make the
cost of hiring new officers very expensive, reports the financial
officer in the San Francisco Department. To hire 50 qualified officers
meeting the quota standards, that department assumes it must recruit,
screen, and test at least 200 applicants.) Therefore the actual cost
of putting 100,000 cops on the street is at least $7 billion per year,
or a minimum of $42 billion over the six-year life of the bill. But
the crime bill provides only $8.845 billion over the six-year period,
or $1.475 billion per year. Thus in order to permanently place 100,000
new police officers on America's streets over the next six years,
state and local governments who apply for Community Policing grants
will have to supplement Washington's contribution with some $33
billion of their own funds.
<P>
     This highly publicized crime bill provides only one-fifth the
necessary funding for 100,000 permanent new police. If cities do not
cut back on other services or raise taxes, the funds provided in the
bill can keep at most just 20,000 permanent cops on the street over
the next six years. There are some 600,000 uniformed police officers
nationwide, so 20,000 represents an increase of just 3 percent, or the
equivalent of adding just one new officer for every police department
in the nation. (But the impact of this additional officer will be
slight. Because of rotational schedules, most large city police
departments require at least five officers to cover a beat in a
24-hour period.)
<P>
     Another way to look at this financial sleight-of-hand is to
calculate how much funding the bill provides per police officer per
year. On average, the bill authorizes $1.475 billion per year for
100,000 new officers. This amounts to just $14,750 per cop per year --
roughly the poverty level for a family of four. Since it is ridiculous
to think that quality police officers could be hired for minimum wage
salaries, state and local governments would have to absorb the
remaining roughly $60,000 per year cost of hiring and keeping each of
these new cops. To meet the 100,000 target, local governments would be
responsible for some $6 billion per year in total new costs.
<P>
     Supporters of the bill no doubt will argue that local governments
will not be stuck with a big tab. They might say, for instance, that
the bill caps at $75,000 the amount local governments may spend
initially to hire a new cop and it also limits the federal share of
this cost at 75 percent. But this changes the real-world scenario very
little. If, for instance, Chicago were to spend $75,000 to hire a new
cop and contribute 25 percent of this cost, the federal share of this
new hiree would be over $56,000. Now, dividing this amount into the
$1.47 billion the bill provides annually for new police would mean it
funds only 26,222 permanent new cops. This is still far short of the
100,000 promised.
<P>
     However the computation is made, the result is the same: the bill
actually funds only a small fraction of the promised new officers.
<P>
     An often overlooked detail, moreover, is the fact that the bill
does not require local governments to use all of these Community
Policing funds to hire new cops. Indeed, 15 percent of these funds can
be used for a variety of social or community activities only
tangentially related to law enforcement, and 20 percent of the
remaining funds can be spent on equipment, computers, and overtime for
existing officers.
<P>
     For example, cities may use the funds in the following ways:
<P>
To enhance police officers' "conflict resolution, mediation, problem
   solving, service, and other skills needed to work in partnership
   with members of the community";
<P>
To "develop new technologies to assist State and local law enforcement
   agencies in reorienting the emphasis of their activities from
   reacting to crime to preventing crime"; and
<P>
To "develop and establish new administrative and managerial systems to
   facilitate the adoption of community-oriented policing as an
   organization-wide philosophy."
<P>
     Cities actually have an incentive to use Community Policing funds
for other purposes because such programs will not add the future costs
of a police officer's pension and other benefits to the municipal
budget. Spending the money on items other than new police officers
means a city does not have to find ways of covering a funding
shortfall after the first year of the bill. Such an incentive system
virtually guarantees that fewer than 20,000 new cops will be hired,
let alone the purported 100,000.
<P>
     Supporters of this bill, moreover, have been less than
forthcoming in noting that 75 percent of these Community Policing
funds can be distributed at the discretion of the Attorney General.
This means that there is no guarantee that the funds will be targeted
toward cities that are in greatest need of new police. It does mean,
however, that the Administration may play politics with these funds
and reward politically loyal mayors and local politicians, rather than
addressing areas of greatest need. (Last year, Congress passed an
emergency supplemental bill which included $150 million in aid to hire
2,000 new police officers. Nearly 45 percent of these funds went to
four states: California, Florida, Illinois, and Texas.)

<P>
<B> SOCIAL WELFARE PORK </B>
<P>
     Roughly $8.7 billion of the funds in the crime bill is dedicated
to creating nearly 30 new "crime prevention" programs ($7.4 billion
for programs identified as "prevention" and $1.3 billion for new "Drug
Courts"). It turns out that many of these new programs are little more
than social welfare pork barrel, adding a new layer of programs onto a
welfare system that already costs taxpayers at all levels of
government over $310 billion per year. (Robert Rector, "A
Comprehensive Urban Policy: How to Fix Welfare and Revitalize
America's Inner Cities," Heritage Foundation Memo To: President-Elect
Clinton No. 12, January 18, 1993. p. 17.) 
<P>
     Unlike the Community Policing grants, these new grant programs
are permanent and will not require matching funds by local government
or the private social service organizations who receive the funds.
This means that recipients will have more incentive to apply for these
funds than the grants intended for new cops. Thus new social service
workers will be much less costly for jurisdictions to hire than new
police officers. Indeed, if all this new social welfare money goes
toward hiring new social workers, the bill will add a minimum of
40,000 social workers per year -- at least two social workers will be
hired for every cop the bill puts on the street. (According to the
Current Population Survey, the typical social worker earns less than
$23,000 annually -- fully one-third less than the average police
officer. Most social workers, especially those working in the
non-profit agencies largely funded by the bill, do not have as
generous benefits packages as unionized police officers or the
training costs (The typical recreational worker earns less than
$12,000 annually). This calculation assumes that the value of a social
workers benefit package is half-again as much as their salary, or some
$12,000, for a total cost per social worker of $36,000.)
<P>
     The assumption behind these new social programs is that potential
criminals can be steered away from a life of crime by targeted
government initiatives aimed at altering their environment. In other
words, crime will be reduced if government provides community
development aid, social services, job training, and recreational
activities.
<P>
     This argument may sound attractive to many taxpayers. But it
belies the fact that society has spent $5 trillion on the War on
Poverty since 1965, yet the national crime rate stands at its highest
level ever. As shown in Chart 1, welfare spending since 1965 has grown
in real terms by 800 percent while the number of major felonies per
capita today is roughly three times the typical rates before 1960.
(Rector, op. cit.) While these two sets of statistics may not be
directly correlated, welfare spending appears to have little impact on
reducing the crime rate.
<P>
     Chart 2 shows that government already has spent lavishly on
programs identical to the ones created in the new crime bill. Since
1965, government has spent $161 billion on community development and
economic aid programs, $202 billion on social service programs, $204
billion on job training programs, and $292 billion on targeted
education programs. These are exactly the types of federal assistance
boosted in the crime bill. They have not cut crime. Moreover, the new
programs created by this bill will duplicate at least 50 existing
federally funded "crime prevention" grant programs. Among other
things, this will compound the overall problem of duplication and
overlapping programs identified last year by Vice President Al Gore's
National Performance Review. The Performance Review found that:
<P>
Some "14 separate government departments and agencies invest $24
   billion a year, through 150 employment and training programs." (The
   National Performance Review, Creating a Government that Works
   Better and Costs Less (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing
   Office) September 7, 1993, p. 49.)
<P>
Washington spends "about $60 billion a year on the well-being of
   children. But we have created at least 340 separate programs for
   families and children, administered by 11 different federal
   agencies and departments." (Ibid., p. 51.)
<P>
"Much of Washington's domestic agenda, $226 billion, to be precise,"
   is allocated to state and local governments "through an array of
   more than 600 different grant programs."
  <P>
     Ten such examples of the 30 new programs added to the current
600, include:
<P>
1)   Local Partnership Act. This new community aid program will hand
     out $1.8 billion to local governments on a formula basis. The
     formula is written to reward areas with high tax rates, high
     unemployment, and low personal income. In other words, cities
     which have overtaxed their residents will benefit most from the
     Local Partnership Act.
<P>
2)   Model Intensive Grants. This program gives the Attorney General
     the discretion to award $895 million to 15 high-crime areas.
     These funds are intended to accomplish the vague goals of
     relieving "conditions that encourage crime" and providing
     "meaningful and lasting alternatives to involvement in crime." In
     reality, this is likely to be a traditional pork barrel program
     because priority will be given to areas marked by the
     "deterioration or lack of public facilities, inadequate public
     services such as public transportation, street lighting... or
     employment services offices." (This specific language was
     contained in the House version of the crime bill (H.R. 4092)
     pages 111-112. The Conference Committee language was not
     available at the time this analysis was written.)
<P>
3)   Youth Employment Skills (YES). This program will spend $650
     million to "test the proposition that crime can be reduced...
     through a saturation jobs program." The 150 job training programs
     already being funded seem to have done little to reduce the crime
     rate. The bill's supporters assume spending more will have an
     impact.
<P>
4)   Ounce of Prevention. This program creates a new interagency
     council to distribute $100 million for summer and after-school
     programs, mentoring and tutoring programs, substance abuse
     treatment, and job placement. This program duplicates dozens of
     established federal programs and countless programs run by local
     governments and non-profit organizations.
<P>
5)   Family and Community Endeavor Schools (FACES). This program
     authorizes the Secretary of Education to dole out some $270
     million to "community-based" organizations. These organizations
     can use the funds for activities such as "work force preparation,
     entrepreneurship, cultural programs, arts and crafts," dance
     programs, and supervised sports programs. However, community
     organizations "may not use such funds to provide sectarian
     worship or instruction." (H.R. 4092, p. 120.)
<P>
6)   Midnight Sports. This well-publicized $40 million program directs
     the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to establish so-
     called midnight basketball leagues. The bill specifies how many
     teams must be in a league, how many players must be on each team,
     and requires that at least half of the players must live in
     public housing. Youth involved in this program must live in an
     area with a substantial drug problem, high crime rates, large
     numbers of people infected with AIDS, and high illegitimacy
     rates. One problem apparently overlooked by those supporting the
     midnight league is that many of the cities toward which this
     program presumably is targeted have curfews for adolescents.
<P>
7)   Violence Against Women. This $1.8 billion program funds an array
     of grant programs intended to assist law enforcement agencies and
     nonprofit groups develop strategies to prevent crimes against
     women. A large portion of these funds must go to "nonprofit
     nongovernmental victim services." The bill establishes the
     Attorney General's Task Force on Violence Against Women at a cost
     of $500,000. The Task Force may hire an Executive Director at an
     annual salary of some $69,000 (GS-15 level) and pay consultants
     up to $200 per day.
<P>
8)   Drug Courts. Though not officially designated a "prevention"
     program, this $1.3 billion grant program is no different from the
     other new social programs. The Drug Court grants are to be used
     by local governments or private organizations involved in
     "continuing judicial supervision over specified categories of
     persons with substance abuse problems, and that involve the
     integrated administration of other sanctions and services." These
     "other services" include: substance abuse treatment, health care,
     education, vocational training, job placement, housing placement,
     and child care or other family support services. (H.R. 4092, p.
     149.)
<P>
9)   Juvenile Drug Trafficking and Gang Prevention Grants. This $125
     million program authorizes the Director of the Bureau of Justice
     Assistance to make grants to local public and nonprofit
     organizations for projects intended to steer young people away
     from gangs and drug activities. Such projects include "school
     programs that teach that drug and gang involvement are wrong,"
     and "programs such as youth sports and other activities,
     including girls and boys clubs, scout troops, and little
     leagues."
<P>
10)  Missing Alzheimer's Patients. The bill approves $3 million in
     grants to establish a Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert
     Program. Many Americans may approve of such an effort, but it is
     unclear how this would eliminate violent crime in America's
     streets.
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION </B>
<P>
     The crime bill conference report Congress will act on this week
does not live up to supporters' promises to put 100,000 new police
officers on the beat. At best the bill will fully fund only 20,000
permanent new cops. Most likely it will mean far fewer because of the
strong incentive it gives local governments to use the Community
Policing grants for other programs. Still, the bill is good news for
social workers: the bill funds a massive expansion of the social
welfare system and could put two social welfare workers on the street
for every new police officer.

THE MYTHS AND REALITIES OF TRADE DEFICITS -- Heritage </title>
   <center><h3><i>THE MYTHS AND REALITIES OF TRADE DEFICITS</h3></i>
<P>

   By Bryan T. Johnson<br>
   Policy Analyst<br>
   Backgrounder No. 1039<br>
   July 5, 1995<br>
   <p></center><hr size=3 width=30%><p>

   <b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
   
     The Clinton Administration's near collision with Japan over
   automobiles and auto parts almost started a trade war with America's second
   largest trading partner. Fortunately, however, the Clinton Adminstration
   backed off from insisting on numerical targets in the trade agreement, even
   though numerical purchasing quotas were the heart of its position. Thus, what
   was largely a defeat for Clinton's managed trade policy is a victory for the
   American consumer.
<p>   
     But the President and his trade team may not have learned the larger
   lesson from their defeat. Underlying the Clinton Administration's policies
   toward Japan is an irrational fear of trade deficits and the belief that
   protectionist policies are necessary to combat them.
   <p>
     Concern that Japan is trading unfairly with the U.S. motivates many
   within the Clinton Administration (and in Congress) to strive for what they call
   a "balanced trade sheet."  Specifically worrisome is the U.S. trade deficit with
   Japan, which is now about $50 billion a year.1 The belief that trade deficits are
harmful is what drove the Clinton Administration to threaten Japan with a trade
war over automobiles and auto parts.
<p>
  The Clinton Administration's managed trade policies are based on a number of
faulty assumptions and myths about trade deficits. Specifically:
<p><ul>
<li>That trade deficits are harmful and trade surpluses are beneficial;
<p><li>
That trade deficits cost jobs;
<p><li>
That Japan's prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies;
<p><li>
That American companies will go bankrupt unless the U.S. government limits import
competition and forces foreign countries to purchase more U.S. goods;
<p><li>
That because the U.S. is unable to sell some goods and services there, Japan's market must
be closed;
<p><li>
That trade surpluses are always the result of government policy;
<p><li>
That trade retaliation is the most effective way to eliminate trade deficits; and
<p><li>
That trade sanctions to redress imbalances will protect American jobs.
<p></ul>
  In each case, however, the answer is:  Not true. For example, the U.S. has run a
trade deficit for most of its history, even during periods of economic growth, and the record
shows that unemployment generally drops as trade deficits rise. Moreover, managed trade
lowers living standards. The Japanese consumer is 30 percent to 40 percent behind his
American counterpart in terms of real purchasing power.
<p>
  In addition, protectionism may save jobs in one industry, but it often destroys many
more jobs in other industries. The fact is that, in most cases, trade retaliation has failed to
open markets while costing American consumers billions in higher prices. And yet, the
myths persist.
<p>

<b>THE MYTHS OF MANAGED TRADE</b>
<p>
  The Clinton Administration's approach to settling its trade disputes with Japan,
China, and other countries rests on a number of myths and faulty assumptions about trade
deficits. These myths are the intellectual foundation of the Administration's managed trade
policies.
<p>
<b>MYTH #1:</b> Trade deficits are harmful and trade surpluses are beneficial.
This is the core idea of protectionism and managed trade policies. Advocates of
this point of view argue that trade deficits harm the economy, destroy jobs, and
reflect a weakness in the economy.
<p>
<b>REALITY:</b>  Not true. Trade deficits are more a sign of strength than of
weakness. The meaning of the U.S. trade deficit is that Americans hold more
goods than their foreign trading partners, while foreigners hold more U.S.
dollars. This is a sign of America's wealth. Being the richest country in the
world, America consumes goods and services from both U.S. and foreign
companies. The influx of foreign goods and services in return for dollars adds
to America's wealth. It does not detract from it.
<p>
  Americans receive imported goods and services that increase their
standard of living. Moreover, the dollars sent abroad for the purchase of goods
and services typically cannot be used within those countries. While the dollars
are traded between countries in the financial markets, they are used mainly by
foreign consumers to buy American goods and services. Thus, nations use
surplus dollars to buy American goods and services, invest in U.S. firms, or
purchase U.S. Treasury bonds. These investments create jobs and wealth for
Americans, while the purchase of Treasury bonds frees U.S. domestic capital
for savings, investment, and purchases.
<p>
  Consider the following example:  The way the protectionists see it,
most people run a trade "deficit" with their grocer. When someone goes to the
supermarket and buys $150 worth of groceries, the protectionist believes the
proprietor has a trade "surplus" of $150, while the customer has a "deficit" of
$150. But this is not the case at all. The grocer ends up with $150 in currency,
while the customer has $150 worth of groceries. It is a mutually beneficial
transaction. Thus, both the grocer and the customer are winners. There are no
losers. No one would expect the grocer to buy an equal amount of goods from
the customer in order to have an equal balance sheet in exchanged goods. Nor
should one expect countries to have an even balance sheet in international
trade. The trade deficit represents nothing more than a surplus of foreign goods
and services which Americans now own. The value of these goods and services
is as much a part of the national wealth as is possession of U.S. dollars.
<p>
  Another misunderstanding involves trade deficit figures. At least one-third to one-half of the U.S. trade deficit figure counts U.S. imports from
American overseas subsidiaries as part of the deficit. For example, when Ford
Mexico sends a motor from its plant to the Ford assembly plant in Detroit, it is
counted as an import. However, if Ford then sells an American-made car with
a Mexican-made motor in the U.S., there is no corresponding export. Thus, a
"deficit" supposedly is created. But why should a car sold in the U.S. be
calculated as part of the trade deficit?  Most of the money made from this sale
stays in the U.S.
<p>
  Trade deficits are not harmful to the economy. If they were, America
would not be the economic powerhouse it is today. For most of its history, the
U.S. has run a trade deficit. For the first hundred years, these deficits were
fairly large. Nevertheless, throughout this period, growth rates were higher
than they are today. Trade deficits did not destroy the economy then. Nor will
they destroy it in the future.
<p>
<b>MYTH #2:</b> Trade deficits cost jobs. Protectionists claim that trade deficits are
a major cause of unemployment. This is the assumption that animated Ross
Perot's charge that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
would cause a "giant sucking sound" of jobs heading south to Mexico.
<p>
<b>REALITY:</b> Not true. History shows that, on average, unemployment drops as
trade deficits rise. If this myth were true, unemployment rates would go up
when trade deficits grow, and unemployment would drop when they shrink. In
fact, the opposite is more likely. For example, while the trade deficit leaped in
1983-1984 and peaked in 1987, the U.S. unemployment rate plummeted,
falling from 9.6 percent in 1983 to 5.5 percent in 1988; when it began to
shrink from 1989 to 1991, unemployment rose from 5.3 percent to 6.7 percent.
When the trade deficit began to rise from 1992 to 1994, unemployment shrank
from 7.4 percent to 6.1 percent (see chart).
<p>
Looking further back in history only confirms that trade deficits do not cause a
loss of jobs. Every year the trade deficit increased since 1962, unemployment
decreased. Likewise, every year the trade deficit decreased since 1962,
unemployment increased.2 Despite the trade deficit, the economy was growing
and jobs were being created.
<p>
<b>MYTH #3:</b>  Japan's prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by
managed trade policies. U.S. policymakers often use Japan as an example of
how a country can eliminate trade deficits by managing trade and industry.
<p>
<b>REALITY:</b>  Not true. A closer look reveals that Japan's managed trade
policies have had mixed results. In fact, too much government "management"
may be responsible for Japan's current economic malaise. If the people's
standard of living is the measure of success, Japan has lost the "economic war"
with the U.S. For example, the real purchasing power of Japanese consumers
is 30 percent to 40 percent lower than that of the American consumer. Thus, in
purchasing power terms, the Japanese are at least one-third poorer than
Americans.
<p>
  Japan's lower standard of living can be attributed partly to managed
trade and industrial policies that drive up the cost of living. For example,
policies that restrict such imports as agricultural products, beef, and other food
items force the average Japanese to spend about 25 percent of his disposable
income on food, compared to less than 12 percent for Americans. Spending
more on food means less money for housing and other needs. The result:  a
lower standard of living.
<p>
<b>MYTH #4:</b> American companies will go bankrupt unless the U.S.
government limits import competition and forces foreign countries to
purchase more U.S. goods. Advocates of managed trade argue that closed
overseas markets are the chief reason for America's trade deficit, causing
enormous economic hardships that result in bankruptcies and lost jobs.
<p>
<b>REALITY:</b> Not true. This scare tactic is employed by U.S. companies to
frighten policymakers into taking up their cause in Washington. And what is
their cause?  To limit import competition with trade protectionism and force
foreign countries to purchase a set amount of U.S. goods and services. These
companies argue that they are hurt by closed markets overseas. As a result,
they want Congress and the Administration to punish American consumers by
forcing them to pay higher prices for imported products like automobiles.
<p>
  But if American companies are so beset by closed markets overseas,
why is America the world's largest exporter?  The U.S. exported over $697
billion in goods and services in 1994.3 By contrast, Germany exported only
$607 billion and Japan only $395 billion.4 Clearly, most U.S. exporters find
overseas markets for their goods.
<p>
  The most vocal complainer is the U.S. automobile industry. Ford Motor Company,
General Motors Company, and Chrysler Corporation are at the forefront in lobbying the U.S.
government to pressure the Japanese government to open its markets to American cars. But
the Big Three earned $14 billion in profits last year. They are in no danger of bankruptcy;
nor do they deserve government coddling.
<p>
<b>MYTH #5:</b>  Because the U.S. is unable to sell some goods and services
there, Japan's market must be closed. Many trade deficit "hawks" argue that
the U.S. has an open market, while Japan restricts American imports. Thus,
Japanese protectionism supposedly is the main cause of the U.S. trade deficit
with Japan.
<p>
<b>REALITY:</b> Not true. Japan is no more protectionist than the United States.
This is the conclusion of The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic
Freedom, which measures the relative level of economic freedom in over 100
countries. The study concludes that Japan and the U.S. have relatively equal
levels of protectionism.5
<p>
  The trade deficit with Japan is not nearly as bad as deficit "hawks" argue. For
example, while the U.S. ran up a $66 billion merchandise trade deficit with Japan in 1994, it
had a $16 billion trade surplus in services. Thus, the real deficit was only about $50  billion.
Moreover, much of the trade deficit with Japan comes from counting the products of
American companies exporting their goods back home. But why should the   importation of
products made by American companies in Japan be counted against the deficit merely
because they were manufactured in Japan?  The profits from these sales go to the
stockholders of American companies, not directly to the Japanese.
<p>
  The truth is that Japan is the largest overseas export market for the U.S. Japan
imported $51 billion in goods from the U.S. in 1994. That is more than the U.S. exported to
the United Kingdom and Germany combined ($25.9 billion and $18.7 billion, respectively).6
Moreover, on a per capita basis, Japan buys more from the U.S. than the U.S.
buys from Japan. For example, each Japanese citizen bought $444 worth of
U.S. goods and services in 1994, while each American citizen purchased only
$441 worth of Japanese goods and services.7 But because Japan's population is
about 50 percent smaller than America's, a deficit exists. Americans purchase
more Japanese goods overall because there are twice as many Americans as
Japanese. Thus, a trade deficit exists for many reasons, but Japanese
protectionism is not the major reason.
<p>
<b>MYTH #6:</b>  Trade deficits are always the result of government policy.
Protectionists are fond of arguing that trade surpluses are "created"
intentionally by government policy. Thus, they reason, trade deficits must be
dealt with in the same manner -- by government action.
<p>
<b>REALITY:</b> Not true. Those who argue that trade surpluses and deficits are the
result of government manipulation fail to understand how a market economy
works. They ignore, for example, that some countries with scarce natural
resources are likely to run a trade surplus because they must import unfinished
goods, which are inexpensive, and export finished goods, which are more
expensive. Japan is a case in point. It must import such raw materials as oil
and lumber. These raw materials are used to manufacture more expensive
finished products, some of which are exported. Throughout this process the
Japanese are adding value to the imported raw materials by making more
expensive finished products for export. The result is a trade surplus. By
contrast, the U.S. has abundant natural resources, which in many cases it
exports. Thus, most of its imports are finished goods, which are more
expensive and worth more than the raw materials that went into making them.
<p>
<b>MYTH #7:</b> Trade retaliation is the most effective way to eliminate trade
deficits. Protectionists believe the best way to open foreign markets is to
threaten trade retaliation. The weapons of choice:  special tariffs and duties and
the imposition of import quotas.
<p>
<b>REALITY:</b> Not true. The U.S. has resorted to such tactics to open foreign
markets, but whether they have worked is debatable. Most of the time, these
threats have backfired. The principal U.S. law used to threaten trade retaliation
is called "Section 301."  This refers to Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act,
which grants the President the authority to impose punitive trade restrictions on
imports. Of the nearly 80 Section 301 cases initiated by the U.S. since 1974,
only about 15 were successful. Yet even in these cases, American consumers
were saddled with billions of dollars in higher prices caused by higher tariffs
and special duties. In the end, all Americans were the losers in this flawed
strategy.
<p>
<b>MYTH #8:</b> Trade sanctions to redress imbalances will protect American
jobs. Trade deficit "hawks" argue that forcing open foreign markets will create
U.S. jobs.
<p>
<b>REALITY:</b> Not true. The history of managed trade shows that even though
one industry may benefit temporarily from government help, the cost to other
industries and to U.S. consumers outweighs these benefits. Years of import
restrictions on textile and apparel products, for example, have destroyed far
more retail jobs than they have created or saved in textile manufacturing.
Moreover, while some jobs were saved in the steel industry as a result of
import restrictions on foreign steel, far more jobs were destroyed in industries
that use steel. Import restrictions increased the prices of finished products that
use steel, forcing businesses to spend more money on raw materials than on
creating new jobs.8 In short, the higher prices paid for domestic steel drove up
the costs of automobiles, machine tools, and appliances, and these higher
production costs stifled job growth in these and other industries.9
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
  The driving force behind the Clinton Administration's threat of trade sanctions
against Japan and its other managed trade policies is a misguided belief that trade deficits are
harmful to the economy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Trade deficits are a sign of
strength. They often represent a growing economy in which jobs and wealth are being
created, not lost.
<p>
  Another myth that inspires the managed trade policies of the Clinton Administration
is that trade deficits are mainly the result of closed markets overseas. Not true. There are
many markets for U.S. goods and services overseas. In fact, the U.S. is the largest exporter in
the world.
<p>
  The Clinton Administration misunderstands America's position in the international
economy. It has wrongly assessed America's massive export strength. It has wrongly   
assessed the implications of America's trade deficit. And it has wrongly assessed the reasons
why Japan has a trade surplus. As a result of these misjudgments, the Administration has
adopted a managed trade policy toward Japan and other countries that could threaten the
wealth and prosperity of all Americans. This is a high price to pay for a belief in myths.

<P>
</CENTER>INTRODUCTION 
 <P>
 Leaders from the major industrialized countries are 
scheduled to meet in Detroit, Michigan, on March 14-15, at 
the request of President Clinton, to discuss the causes of 
the persistently high levels of unemployment in their 
countries. Announcing the goals of the summit in Europe this 
January, President Clinton declared that, "We simply must 
figure out how to create more jobs and how to reward people 
who work both harder and smarter in the workplace." (David 
R. Sands, "Clinton Announces Plans for Jobs Summit," The 
Washington Times, January 11, 1994, p. B7.)
<P>
 The President is right to focus on how to create more jobs 
in this country. Although he boasted during his State of the 
Union address that 1.6 million jobs were created in 1993, 
job growth, in fact, is much weaker than normal this long 
after a recession. Since World War II, total employment 
growth has averaged 9.2 percent 33 months after a recession. 
But since the bottom of the 1990-1991 recession, total 
employment in the United States has climbed by just 2.5 
percent. (Daniel J. Mitchell, "The Budget and the Economy:  
A First Year Assessment of the Clinton Presidency," Heritage 
Foundation Backgrounder Update No. 213, February 7, 1994, p. 
2.)  President Clinton would do well to ponder the anemic 
job growth in Europe, because European firms are encumbered 
with costly mandates and taxes on employment that have 
discouraged hiring and held back employment growth. The 
President should recognize that his Administration's 
policies are repeating the mistake of the Europeans, and 
contributing to slow growth of earnings and employment in 
the United States. For example, the Administration has:
<P>
 Enacted the biggest tax increase in American history, which 
will discourage new business investment and job creation by 
raising corporate and individual tax rates.
<P>
 Signed the mandated Family and Medical Leave Act, which 
will raise labor costs and force employers to be far more 
selective about whom they hire, since they are required to 
offer certain employees more time off.
<P>
 Proposed a massive overhaul of the health care system, 
which would raise labor costs by mandating that employers 
cover workers. According to Lewin-VHI, one of the country's 
leading health care econometrics firms, the Clinton health 
plan would mean that among firms now providing health 
insurance, 19.9 percent would see costs per employee rising 
$500-$1,000 per year, 51.6 percent would face cost increases 
per employee of $1,000-$2,500, while another 15.2 percent 
would face costs per employee of more than $2,500. (Lewin-
VHI, The Financial Impact of the Health Security Act 
(Fairfax, VA:  Lewin-VHI, 1993).)
<P>
 Proposed worker training and unemployment insurance reform, 
that would cost between $3 billion and $9 billion per year. 
(David R. Sands, "Hill Republicans Criticize Clinton's 
Jobless Measure," The Washington Times, February 23, 1994, 
p. B8.)
<P>
 Considered a hike in the minimum wage from $4.25 to $4.75 
an hour, which would further increase the disincentive to 
hire teenage and poor, inner-city unemployed individuals.
<P>
 Moved ahead with an ambitious environmental regulatory 
agenda rangeing from global warming to new logging policies. 
(Federal Register pages, a rough estimate of the overall 
amount of regulatory activity, ran 60,950 for 1993, the 
highest level since the Carter Administration left office in 
1980.)
<P>
 These policies signal an apparent misunderstanding of the 
employment and job policies that led to the creation of over 
20 million new jobs in the 1980s. (See Daniel J. Mitchell, 
"Tax Rates, Fairness, and Economic Growth:  Lessons from the 
1980s," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 860, October 
15, 1991, p. 2.)  Each of these new programs or proposed 
policies add to the three principal governmental barriers 
that discourage employers from creating new jobs:  taxes, 
credit barriers, and regulatory and mandated benefit 
burdens. These barriers, which have steadily increased over 
the past few years in the United States, have discouraged 
business expansion and increased the cost of hiring new 
workers. Failure to reduce these barriers or -- worse still 
-- the imposition of new barriers, means that America will 
become a slow-growth economy.
<P>
  President Clinton should realize that high wages and 
mandated benefits are ruining the European economies and 
leading to high unemployment rates. In fact, several 
European countries and Japan are now trying to lower their 
labor costs and dismantle their generous "safety nets."  
Instead of continuing to add more burdens on employers, 
President Clinton should take the opportunity of the summit 
to advocate five simple principles of job creation: 
<p>
Principle #1:  European-style job training and employment 
policies have proven incapable of keeping unemployment low 
or raising the worker's overall standard of living.
<P>
 Principle #2:  High tax rates on employers and capital is 
the quickest way to insure high unemployment.
<P>
 Principle #3:  Excessive financial and banking regulations, 
which restrict the amount of capital firms can obtain, 
greatly limit business and job expansion.
<P>
 Principle #4:  Increasing the regulatory burden and 
mandating numerous employee benefits is a recipe for job 
destruction.
<P>
 Principle #5:  Sustained job growth results from 
competitive, efficient industries that are free of excessive 
government interference.
<P>
 Only by talking bluntly to the European allies and shunning 
"solutions" to the continuing problems of unemployment that 
will only slow wage growth, can President Clinton help the 
industrialized world to correct its economic ills. Adopting 
European-style employment policies, on the other hand, will 
lead only to European-style results. 
<P>
 UNDERSTANDING THE FIVE PRINCIPLES OF JOB GROWTH
<P>
  PRINCIPLE #1: European-style job training and employment 
policies have proven incapable of keeping unemployment low 
or raising the worker's overall standard of living.
<P>
 During his speech announcing the jobs summit, President 
Clinton declared, "We Americans have a lot to learn from 
Europe in matters of job training and apprenticeship, of 
moving our people from school to work into good-paying 
jobs." (Sands, "Clinton Announces Plans...," op. cit.)  
Undoubtedly, Americans have much to learn from the 
Europeans, but not about their employment policies. 
<P>
 The true effects of the European policies which the 
President and others glorify are best illustrated by the 
case of Germany. German workers enjoy roughly six weeks paid 
vacation each year, the shortest work week of any major 
industrial nation, high wages (averaging $26 an hour), and 
extensive health benefits mandated by the government. But as 
Ferdinand Protzman of The New York Times notes, 
"Unfortunately, [the German system] no longer works. 
Instead, the social contract that once made Germany's 
economy a model of stability has helped erode the nation's 
competitiveness as it struggles to recover from the worst 
recession in postwar history." (Ferdinand Protzman, 
"Rewriting the Contract for Germany's Vaunted Workers," The 
New York Times, February 13, 1994, p. F5.)
<P>
 Like many of its European neighbors, Germany is struggling 
with what has come to be known as "Eurosclerosis," which 
signifies a stagnant growth environment. As the chart on the 
following page shows, adherence to this model has brought 
the European Union (EU) slow growth and high unemployment. 
Unemployment has averaged almost 10 percent over the past 
decade in the major European countries, and is projected to 
average 12.1 percent in 1994 for the members of the EU. At 
the end of last year, approximately 32 million Europeans 
were jobless, which is roughly equivalent to the combined 
workforces of Spain and Sweden. (Stella Dawson, "Global Jobs 
Summit Delayed Amid NAFTA Battle," The Reuters European 
Business Report, November 4, 1993.)  Overall, the U.S. rate 
of employment growth has far outstripped Europe. Observes C. 
Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute of International 
Economics, "The U.S. has kept labor costs down and created 
40 million new jobs over the past 20 years. In Europe, wages 
have risen about 60 percent during that span but only 2 or 3 
million jobs have been created." (Quoted in Protzman, op. 
cit.)
<P>
 Peter Gumbel of The Wall Street Journal maintains this 
Eurosclerosis is caused by a "tangle of labor regulations 
and rising costs for employers [which] acts as a major 
disincentive to job- creation -- and a powerful incentive to 
moving production elsewhere." (Peter Gumbel, "Western Europe 
Finds That It's Pricing Itself Out of the Job Market," The 
Wall Street Journal, December 9, 1993, p. A1.)  Not 
surprisingly, perhaps, some 30 percent of business surveyed 
recently by the German Chamber of Commerce say they are 
considering shifting production to a more hospitable 
business environment. 
<P>
 Beside the European burdens on employers which discourage 
job expansion, employment is also discouraged through 
extensive unemployment insurance programs. Explains David R. 
Henderson of the Hoover Institution, "A single 40-year-old 
previously employed at the average production worker's wage 
would get benefits equal to 59% of previous earnings in 
France, 58% in Germany and 70% in the Netherlands." (David 
R. Henderson, "Eurosclerosis Spreads to Our Shores," The 
Wall Street Journal, October 14, 1993, p. A16.)  These 
benefits can be collected for many years as well. Hence, 
although the broad safety net available to displaced workers 
seems compassionate on the surface, it actually creates 
disincentives to full employment and a productive workforce. 
Absenteeism, for example, ran at 9 percent in Western 
Germany in 1992, 8.2 percent in France, and 12.1 percent in 
Sweden. By way of comparison, the U.S. rate is only 3 
percent. (Protzman, op. cit.)
<P>
 Also overrated is the German job training system, which 
Clinton and his Labor Secretary, Robert Reich, seek to 
emulate. While the German educational system focuses on 
highly technical training for its future workers, the U.S. 
system focuses on generalized training. Some academics, such 
as Lester Thurow of MIT argue that the German approach has 
created a superior workforce which enjoys a better standard 
of living. But a recent comparison of the two systems by 
Kenneth A. Couch, of Syracuse University, disputes this 
belief. Couch concludes that, "an apprenticeship program by 
itself is unlikely to have widespread positive effects 
either on economic measures such as employment or indirectly 
related social problems." (Kenneth A. Couch, "Germans and 
Job Training, Education and Us," The American Enterprise, 
November/December 1993, p. 18.)  For example, comparing 
German and American 24- to 33-year-old high school 
graduates without further education, Couch found roughly the 
same percentage were employed (with actually more Americans 
than Germans possessing manufacturing jobs), more of the 
Americans in the sample group were married, and slightly 
more Americans had children. Likewise, from 1983 to 1988, 
Couch found American workers outperformed their German 
counterparts overall. America experienced average annual 
employment growth during the period of 2.4 percent, versus 
Germany's meager 0.4 percent. And real GDP growth over the 
same period averaged 3.9 percent for America and 2.3 percent 
for Germany. Other European countries have fared no better 
relative to America.
<P>
 If American policymakers choose to move toward a more 
technical-based educational system, the German approach 
thus is not the obvious model to follow. As Couch notes, 
"Emulating the German approach may in fact give us an 
educational system that will not perform better but will 
cost more than our current one." (Ibid., p. 13.)
<P>
 Following the Failed Model. European-style job training and 
employment policies which have been implemented in America 
have met with failure. Public employment programs have 
proven to be net job destroyers, since the amount of money 
required to create a public sector job is typically several 
times that of private sector job creation. (See Edward L. 
Hudgins, Ph.D., "Why Infrastructure Spending Won't Jump 
Start the Economy," Heritage Foundation Memo to President-
Elect Clinton No. 9, January 15, 1993.)  A recent study of 
public transit investment by John Semmens of the Chandler, 
Arizona-based Laissez Faire Institute, notes that for the 
$61.5 billion invested since 1965, only 800,000 jobs were 
created. If that same amount of money had been invested by 
private business through a corporate tax cut, 8 million jobs 
could have been created. (John Semmens, "Government 
Investments Yield Poor Results," Heartland Institute, A 
Heartland Perspective, October 18, 1993, p.2.)  Likewise, 
Semmens found that 13 million to 20 million jobs would have 
been created if the $61.5 billion had instead been devoted 
to a capital gains tax cut, or an expansion of Individual 
Retirement Account investment in Treasury bills or common 
stocks. (John Semmens, "Federal Transit Subsidies:  How 
Government Investment Harms the Economy," The Freeman, 
February 1994, p. 71-75.)  Most important, instead of 
producing the high-wage, well-skilled jobs the current 
Administration calls for so frequently, public programs only 
provide low-wage, low-skill, temporary employment, which 
often costs taxpayers dearly in the process.
<P>
 Further, it cannot be argued that government sponsored 
employment training policies provide European citizens with 
greater purchasing power and a higher standard of living 
than Americans. Purchasing power parity, which is the most 
accurate measure of comparative consumer power, shows that 
U.S. consumers have a clear advantage over foreign citizens 
(see table on preceeding page). Following Europe's poor 
example, therefore, likely will lead not only to lower 
growth and fewer jobs, but also to a lower standard of 
living for American citizens.
<P>
 The "Europeanization" of the American Labor Market. Despite 
the failure of the European system to sustain employment and 
a higher standard of living, America's federal labor market 
policy is being molded to resemble German, French, and other 
European models. This "Europeanization" of the American 
labor market policy threatens to undermine industrial 
competitiveness, increase budgetary strains, and lower the 
average worker's standard of living. 
<P>
 PRINCIPLE #2: High tax rates on employers and capital is 
the quickest way to insure high unemployment.
<P>
 To hire additional workers, employers need capital. Capital 
fuels job creation by allowing employers to invest in the 
various means of production, including land, equipment, 
factories, new technologies, and labor. Capital can be 
acquired in one of two ways:  saving it from profits or 
borrowing it. Examining each method of capital accumulation 
indicates why U.S. employers are finding it increasingly 
difficult to obtain the fuel for job creation.
<P>
 The Current Tax Environment. Past recoveries show that the 
U.S. economy is performing below typical levels. Whereas 
employment in the previous post-war recoveries averaged 9.2 
percent 33 months after the end of the recession, the 
current recovery has only seen approximately 2.5 percent 
growth over a similar period of time. One factor that aided 
recoveries during the early 1960s and early 1980s was a 
reduction in tax rates.
<P>
 Unfortunately, the most recent recession, which followed 
the 1990 tax hikes, has been followed by tax rate increases. 
The Clinton tax plan adopted by Congress last year increased 
taxes on business and investment. The corporate tax rate on 
business, for example, was raised from 34 percent to 36 
percent. Likewise, top individual rates moved up from 31 
percent to as high as 42.5 percent. This is important since 
approximately 80 percent of small businesses pay taxes under 
the personal income tax code. The excessive taxation of 
capital gains also continues. The capital gains tax on 
individuals currently stands at 28 percent, up from 20 
percent in 1986. As the chart on the following page shows, 
before this rate jump, new business incorporations had risen 
steadily throughout the 1980s. After the increase, start-ups 
fell immediately and sharply. The aggregate effect of these 
taxes is a huge barrier to job creation, as capital shifts 
from the hands of investors to the government. 
<P>
 The Effects of the Tax Barrier. High taxes reduce 
investment in businesses and slow job growth by encouraging 
individuals and firms to seek alternative investments with a 
more profitable return on their dollar. It should be no 
surprise that America's current savings and investment rates 
are lower than those required for robust, long-run economic 
growth. This is due directly to the trade-off investors face 
when contemplating increasing consumption versus saving or 
investing. Increasing consumption carries little penalty; 
few taxes or other disincentives exist for immediate 
purchases. But forgoing current consumption to invest assets 
represents an increasingly unattractive option if the 
rewards of profitability springing from investment are 
penalized with higher tax rates. Moreover, earnings in the 
U.S. are still penalized twice through taxation, first at 
the corporate level and then later at the individual level. 
Therefore, if an investor had $10,000 to spend or invest, 
spending currently would more than likely represent a more 
attractive choice than investing. 
<P>
 Taxes raise the cost of capital for industrial equipment 
and machinery. As the American Council for Capital Formation 
(ACCF) reports, "Recent research confirm[s]... that the 
volume of investment in equipment is a critical factor in 
the pace of economic growth and development. [I]nvestment in 
equipment is perhaps the single most important factor in 
economic growth and development." (Mark Bloomfield and Margo 
Thorning, Ph.D., "The Impact of President Clinton's Tax 
Proposals on Capital Formation," American Council for 
Capital Formation, Testimony to the House Ways and Means 
Committee, March 16, 1993, p. 5.)  Yet, ACCF points out that 
despite the beneficial effects of the tax-reducing Economic 
Recovery Act of 1981 on such investment, tax policy in the 
following years became heavily biased against such 
investment incentives. The tax acts of 1982 and 1986, which 
raised taxes, each resulted in an increase in the cost of 
capital for equipment as investors found such opportunities 
less attractive. Largely as a result of these high-tax 
policies, the total cost of capital for manufacturing 
equipment increased by 22.9 percent from 1981 to 1986. The 
most recent revisions of the tax code are likely to further 
discourage investment, and thereby increase barriers to 
expansion and job creation.
<P>
 Hence, the potential for long-term job creation in the 
current tax environment is not encouraging, since 
entrepreneurs are less able to entice investors to risk 
their money on new business ventures. Because taxes create 
disincentives to invest in businesses, capital for future 
job creation is being produced at a lower rate.
<P>
 PRINCIPLE #3: Excessive financial and banking regulations, 
which restrict the amount of capital firms can obtain, 
greatly limit business and job expansion.
<P>
 In recent years, the term "credit crunch" has been coined 
to refer to how difficult it has been for many businesses to 
obtain loans. One reason this crunch has occurred has been 
the sharp rise in banking regulation in recent years. In 
addition to $10.7 billion in general regulatory compliance 
costs in 1992, bankers face costs from lost interest 
payments on reserves they are required hold at the Federal 
Reserve, and deposit insurance premiums. (Not included in 
the $10.7 billion figure are the potential costs from the 
FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, which could push regulatory 
costs even higher.)
<P>
 The Effects of the Credit Barrier. How do these trends 
affect job creation?  This regulatory burden has had a 
restrictive effect on credit growth in recent years. The 
American Bankers Association observes that over this same 
period, more than 40 major federal regulations affecting 
bank operations were promulgated. (American Bankers 
Association, "The Banking Industry:  The Key to Jobs and 
Economic Growth," February 1, 1993, p. 8.)  Although 
estimates of the regulatory burden on banks are not 
available for previous recessionary periods, there is no 
doubt that the number of regulatory restrictions and burdens 
the banking industry faces have increased significantly over 
the past 20 years. Declares the American Bankers 
Association:  "Hog-tying the banking system with regulatory 
red tape means two things -- more expensive bank credit and 
less of it." (American Bankers Association, "Cutting the Red 
Tape:  Let Banks Get Back to Business," November 1992.)
<P>
 Just as higher taxes restricted job creation by holding 
back entrepreneurs, so too has the credit crunch. Without 
easy access to credit, American firms are forced to postpone 
plans for job expansion. A 1993 survey of small and mid-size 
businesses by the Arthur Anderson Enterprise Group revealed 
that 38 percent of all businesses surveyed were unable to 
fulfill their capital needs. Perhaps more important, 58 
percent of businesses that were in their first three years 
of operation have been unable to fulfill their capital 
needs. The same survey noted that, due to the lack of 
capital, 39 percent of the surveyed businesses were unable 
to expand operations and almost 20 percent of them reduced 
employment. (Arthur Anderson Enterprise Group, Survey of 
Small and Mid-Sized Businesses:  Trends for 1993, June 1993, 
p. 11.)  Limited access to capital has also made it more 
difficult for firms to purchase their own equipment, forcing 
an increasing number of small businesses to lease equipment, 
often at very high interest rates. (Michael Selz, "Many 
Small Businesses Are Sold on Leasing Equipment," The Wall 
Street Journal, October 27, 1993, p. B2.)
<P>
 In response to this problem, the Clinton Administration has 
called for new banking regulations governing how loans are 
made. The Administration hopes to boost the number of loans 
made through the Small Business Administration to "make SBA 
more responsive to those industries with the potential for 
creating a higher number of jobs, those involved in 
international trade, and those producing critical 
technologies." (The National Performance Review, Creating a 
Government That Works Better & Costs Less, September 7, 
1993, p. 148.)  But this is unlikely to be a solution to the 
underlying problem of restricted credit growth. The SBA loan 
program accounts for only a small percent of capital for new 
firms, and in any case tends to funnel dollars to favored 
businesses rather than the best investments.
<P>
 Clinton's new plan to reform banking regulation through 
agency consolidation will not help either. Monopolizing 
regulatory power in the hands of one agency will make it 
easier for heavy-handed and manipulative policies to be 
implemented, thereby raising the regulatory burdens faced by 
banks. Lawrence Lindsey, a member of the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System, says, "Monopoly regulation is 
a bad idea. [It] will greatly harm both the banking industry 
and the economy, and lead to an unfortunate politicization 
of bank regulatory policy." (Lawrence Lindsey, "How to 
Corrupt Banking," Forbes, January 31, 1994, p. 100.)
<P>
 PRINCIPLE #4: Increasing the regulatory burden and 
mandating numerous employee benefits is a recipe for job 
destruction.
<P>
 The number of regulations and mandated benefit requirements 
that employers are forced to comply with has grown steadily 
in recent years. Estimates of the total cost that 
regulations impose on the economy range from a low of $615 
billion to a high of $1.7 trillion. (See "Manhandled by 
Mandates," Forbes, October 25, 1993, p. 39; William G. 
Laffer III and Nancy A. Bord, "George Bush's Hidden Tax:  
The Explosion in Regulation," Heritage Foundation 
Backgrounder No. 905, July 10, 1992.)  This burden 
translates into millions of foregone job opportunities. 
(William G. Laffer III, "How Regulation is Destroying 
American Jobs," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 926, 
February 16, 1993)  For example, Michael Hazilla and Raymond 
Kopp have estimated that environmental regulations reduced 
aggregate employment by 1.18 percent as of 1990, (Michael 
Hazilla and Raymond J. Kopp, "Social Cost of Environmental 
Quality Regulations:  A General Equilibrium Analysis," 
Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 98, No. 4 (1990), p. 
867.) which means over one million jobs would have existed 
without the regulations. ( Laffer and Bord, op. cit., p. 6.)
<P>
 Regulation and mandated benefits take their toll 
indirectly. When the government increases this burden on the 
private sector by promulgating new rules, firms must adjust 
their behavior accordingly. This adjustment process may 
require an increase in worker training, paperwork 
requirements, or even retooling. Regardless of the 
adjustment method, costs will be incurred. The costs of 
adjustment directly affect the firm's profits since a 
greater than expected amount of earnings will be exhausted 
in compliance measures. In addition there may be extra costs 
associated with hiring new workers. As a result, firms will 
try to pass the costs of adjustment on to their consumers, 
or, if that is not possible due to competitive market 
conditions, scale back future production, investment, or new 
hiring. If the new compliance and adjustment costs are 
sufficiently high, firms may scale back existing production 
and lay off workers.
<P>
 The Effects of the Regulatory and Mandated Benefits 
Barrier. Several studies point to the job-destroying effect 
of the regulation and mandated benefits explosion that has 
taken place in recent years. (See Laffer, op. cit., p. 7; 
Gary Anderson and Lowell Gallaway, "Derailing the Small 
Business Job Express," (Washington, D.C.:  Joint Economic 
Committee, November 7, 1992); Lowell Gallaway and Richard 
Vedder, "Why Johnny Can't Work:  The Causes of 
Unemployment," Policy Review, Fall 1992; Alan Reynolds, 
"Cruel Costs of the 1991 Minimum Wage," The Wall Street 
Journal, July 7, 1992, p. A14.)  With the passage of 
mandates included in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 
the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, and the Civil 
Rights Act of 1991, and the increases in the minimum wage in 
1990 and 1991, the burdens on employers have ballooned. 
<P>
 The dramatic rise in the minimum wage alone, from $3.35 in 
1989 to $3.80 in 1990 and $4.25 in 1991, helped push teenage 
unemployment to the highest rate in a decade. If the Clinton 
Administration proceeds with plans for a 50 cent hike in the 
minimum wage, and the labor market adjusts as it has in the 
past, there is likely to be an increase in the teenage 
unemployment rate of between 0.5 percent and 3 percent.
<P>
 Another burdensome employer mandate will be the "employer 
trip reduction" requirement of the Clean Air Act. Starting 
this year, this will require employers in nine metropolitan 
areas to reduce the number of employees driving to work. 
Although no employment loss estimates are available, over 12 
million employees will be covered by the act, making it 
difficult to believe that some jobs will not be effected. 
(See David Andrew Price, "Newest Mandate -- Everyone Into 
the Carpool," The Wall Street Journal, November 8, 1993, p. 
A14.)
<P>
 Whatever their intentions, civil rights employment mandates 
also take their toll. Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer of 
Forbes recently estimated the total cost of civil rights 
regulation to be $236 billion, which translates into a loss 
of 4 percent of GNP. (Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer, 
"When Quotas Replace Merit, Everybody Suffers," Forbes, 
February 15, 1993, p. 82.)
<P>
 The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which grants 
employees as much as 12 weeks unpaid leave each year, 
discourages job creation. Because many employers will not be 
able to absorb the high costs and lost output resulting from 
mandatory worker leave, the policy will have the unintended 
consequence of encouraging struggling businesses not to hire 
individuals who might take advantage of the leave policy. 
The SBA has found the overall costs of this act to total as 
much as $1.2 billion. (Eileen Trzcinski and William T. 
Alpert, "Leave Policies in Small Business:  Findings From 
the U.S. Small Business Administration Employee Leave 
Survey," Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy 
Research Summary Number 99, March 1991.)
<P>
 Other employer mandates that currently burden the labor 
market include the health care requirements found in the 
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 
(COBRA), the prevailing wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon 
Act, and workers and unemployment compensation payments. 
These factors create added disincentives to job expansion 
since taking on an additional worker means steadily higher 
employer payroll burdens.
<P>
 Employment Thresholds. In recent years, many legislators 
have come to realize that added regulation and mandates have 
a destructive effect on job growth, particularly in the 
small business sector. But, instead of attempting to craft 
more sensible policies or deregulate where possible, they 
tend to respond to small business concerns by adopting 
employment thresholds. Employment thresholds exempt smaller- 
sized businesses from certain regulations. For example, the 
Americans With Disabilities Act currently exempts all firms 
with fewer than 25 employees from the regulation; this will 
be lowered to cover firms with fewer than 15 employees after 
July 26, 1994. Other examples include the Family and Medical 
Leave Act, which exempts business with fewer than 50 
employees and the Plant Closing Law, which exempts 
businesses below 100 employees.

 These thresholds have the unfortunate side-effect of 
discouraging employers near the threshold from hiring new 
employees. Pointing to the Family and Medical Leave Act, 
Ruth Stafford, president of the Kiva Container Corporation, 
says, "Fifty is the magic number." (Jeanne Saddler, "Small 
Firms Try To Curb Impact of Leave Law," The Wall Street 
Journal, August 5, 1993, p. B1.)  Her firm, like many 
others, plans to hold employment stable just under the 50 
employee barrier using more temporary or part-time workers. 
This phenomenon is already being seen:  according to the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, temporary employment grew by 20 
percent in 1993, up from 6 percent in 1990.
<P>
 PRINCIPLE #5: Sustained job growth results from 
competitive, efficient industries that are free of excessive 
government interference.
<P>
 Steering America onto a path of greater job creation, low 
unemployment, and a higher standard of living will require a 
shift of current American economic policy. The three primary 
governmental barriers to job expansion -- high taxes, 
limited credit through irrational financial regulations, and 
excessive regulations and added mandated benefits -- all 
must be corrected. Adopting the European system would be a 
mistake. America should instead learn from history that 
where goods, services, labor, and wages have been allowed to 
move or fluctuate freely, prosperity, entrepreneurship, and 
high employment have been the result. 
<P>
 To put America back on the high-employment, high-wage 
track, President Clinton should take several specific and 
immediate steps to ensure American industries remain strong 
and competitive:
<P>
 Step #1:  Lower tax rates on businesses and capital. The 
effects of high tax rates on employers and capital are 
direct and damaging. Lowering both corporate tax rates and 
the capital gains tax rate (while indexing it for inflation) 
would provide an immediate and strong job stimulus by 
reducing the cost of hiring workers and unlocking the 
capital needed for business expansion.
<P>
 Step #2:  Reject all attempts to establish a European-style 
employment policy, especially expensive job training 
programs. High wages, sustained employment, and increased 
business activity should be guiding goals of public policy. 
Mandating them should not. Costly and ineffective job 
training programs should be ruled out as job-creating 
options. Americans need only look at the failure of European 
programs to understand why such an approach is a mistake. 
Such programs require massive amounts of public spending for 
the small number of jobs which are created.
<P>
 Step #3:  Cap federal spending. This will aid job creation 
by increasing the amount of private savings available for 
business investment.
<P>
 Step #4:  Enact comprehensive regulatory reform. The 
"hidden tax" of regulation and increased mandated benefits 
directly increase the cost of employing workers. The 
President and Congress should establish a federal regulatory 
budget and estimate the employment impact of regulations 
before they take effect. The regulatory budget would place a 
limit on the total cost that is imposed on the economy each 
year by new federal regulations. When the budget had been 
passed, no new regulations could be imposed -- unless other 
rules were withdrawn.
<P>
 Step #5:  Adopt rational health care reform based upon 
consumer choice and not new employer mandates. No new policy 
action threatens to do as much damage to the labor market in 
the immediate future as does employer-based health care 
mandates. While reform is needed, it should not simply push 
the cost of comprehensive health coverage onto employers 
through expensive new payroll taxes. Accomplishing reform in 
this manner will result in the loss of millions of jobs. 
(See Daniel J. Mitchell, "The Economic and Budget Impact of 
the Clinton Health Plan," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder 
No. 974, January 13, 1994.)
<P>
 Step #6:  Reform America's archaic financial and banking 
laws. Financial restrictions such as the McFadden Act of 
1927, the Bank Holding Act of 1956, and the Glass-Steagall 
Act of 1933 retard bank stability and expansion and, 
therefore, limit the credit opportunities they can offer to 
businesses. Eliminating these impediments to financial 
efficiency would allow businesses to take advantage of 
expansionary opportunities by borrowing needed capital.
<P>
 Step #7:  Overhaul antiquated antitrust laws. America's 
outdated antitrust laws, such as the Sherman Antitrust Act 
of 1890 and the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, make it 
difficult for firms to enter into joint production alliances 
that could raise industrial efficiency and create new job 
opportunities.
<P>
 Step #8:  Pass product liability reform and other tort 
reform legislation. Currently, America's tort system saps 
private sector entrepreneurialism, hinders product 
innovation, and threatens the continuation of numerous 
businesses. Without reforms limiting punitive damages and 
streamlining costly court procedures, an increasing number 
of jobs will be placed at risk.
<P>
 Step #9:  Continue to push for trade liberalization 
globally while eliminating domestic barriers to free trade. 
While the job gains will result from the wise actions 
already taken of passing the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) agreements, further efforts should be made to expand 
free trade agreements while lowering the domestic barriers 
to imports.
<P>
 Step #10:  Encourage the use of privatization and 
contracting out whenever possible. Privatization and 
contracting out not only insure that services are delivered 
more efficiently for less money, they also allow private 
firms to raise capital and re- invest in more productive, 
long-term private sector jobs. Vice President Gore's 
National Performance Review failed to tap such methods of 
real government reform. (See Scott A. Hodge and Adam D. 
Thierer, "The National Performance Review:  Falling Short of 
Real Government Reform," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder 
No. 962, October 7, 1993.)  Undertaking such measures would 
encourage increased private sector employment while 
demonstrating that the Administration is serious about 
changing the way Washington works.
<P>
 CONCLUSION
<P>
 The Jobs Summit affords President Clinton the opportunity 
to outline the fundamental principles of job creation to the 
industrial nations of the world. Unfortunately, many 
nations, specifically in Europe and more recently the United 
States, have forgotten that low taxes, easy access to 
credit, rational regulations, and vigorous exposure to 
competition, are the foundation for a healthy, job- creating 
economy. 
<P>
 The most important lesson that President Clinton can bring 
back from Detroit is that government policies that increase 
the cost of hiring people mean that fewer people will be 
hired.

<h3>LESS FROM WASHINGTON, MORE FROM US: A CITIZENSHIP AGENDA FOR A RISING, SHINING AMERICA</h3><P>

<b>By Lamar Alexander</b><br>
Candidate for the President of the United States<br>
January 5, 1996<br>

<P>
<b>A Wake-Up Call</b><p>
In only nine weeks, we will know who Republicans will nominate to be the first President of the next century. This year, the race is a 40-yard dash. Washington is already telling us to expect a Dole-Clinton contest, a debate about what is going on in Washington, and then another Clinton presidency. I am here today to challenge the Washington wisdom and deliver a wake-up call to the Republican Party.

<P>Republicans know in our hearts that we cannot defeat Bill Clinton with a message that is only about cutting government in Washington. Yet, so far, that is all the debate has been about: more or less government, more or less spending, CBO numbers versus OMB numbers, a Senate bill versus a House bill. The public is being cheated out of the most important conversation. The debate we should be having is beyond the budget.

<P>It is about ending 60 years of the New Deal/Great Society mentality that has looked to government to meet every social need. It is about ending the equation between compassion and government spending. It requires the courage to stand up and say this equation is a lie, it is false, and it is hurting people. Most important, the debate we should be having is about creating a new understanding of the respective roles of citizens, communities, and government.

<P>Most Americans in the real world are living lives beset by anxiety and fear; the breakdown of our families, neighborhoods, and schools; and the upheaval brought about by the computer age and disappearing jobs. Hearing and watching this dance in Washington, they must be wondering, "Is that all there is?"  Does everyone there wear green eyeshades, talk about OMBs and CBOs, believe that the solution for every problem involves getting some bill out of a subcommittee?  Is there nobody willing to talk with us about what kind of America we will have in the year 2000 and beyond, and how we're going to get there?  If the coming presidential campaign is about government rather than citizenship, about budget bills rather than communities, about what goes on in Congress rather than what goes on in our neighborhoods, churches, schools, and families, and Republicans offer no more vision than what is provided in their charts, then the prospects are indeed bleak for 1996. The combination of a President Clinton and a Speaker Gephardt is a nightmare we don't want to wake up to on November 5. After all, we should not forget that 1928 was the last time a Republican Congress was re-elected. 1994 was a realigning election, but how secure is the realignment?

<P>We already have a good idea of what the President's re-election strategy is. Clinton will run as a caring visionary offering adult supervision for the excesses of the Republican revolution. So we cannot defeat Bill Clinton tactically. We have to defeat him by giving the electorate a clear choice of two visions of America: a vision of an America that works, family by family, community by community, versus an America of group rights, declining opportunities, and children trapped in schools where they can't learn.

<P>Here's the truth: Charts and graphs, even when they score the right economic points, will never win the larger debate. Big government, by itself, did not create all the problems we have today, and less government, by itself, will not solve those problems. Which is why we need to focus in a positive way on where we are going. It may be more fun to explain what's wrong with the Great Society programs and the welfare state we want to dismantle, but we have both a moral and strategic imperative to do more than that: We need to paint a clear picture of the kind of America we want to see.

<P>My purpose today is to invite you to join me in setting a different agenda for the Republican presidential contest:<ul>

<li>To move the debate outside Washington, D.C., and beyond the budget.

<li>To capture the moral high ground, without which no party can be a majority party.

<li>To paint a picture of our country's future that provides voters with a real choice.

<li>To offer a New Promise of American Life that depends upon expecting less from Washington and more from ourselves, with the emphasis on more from ourselves.</ul>

<p><b>A Vision Contest</b><p>

On my walk across New Hampshire, I came across a lady taking a break from her work at a shoe factory in Manchester. I stuck out my hand and said, "I'm Lamar Alexander, and I'd like to be your next President."

<p>The lady looked at me and at my red and black shirt and said, a little alarmed, "That's all we need. Another President!"

<p>Given the President we've got, I can understand how the lady feels. At a time when our greatest problem is teaching our children the difference between right and wrong, Bill Clinton is exactly the wrong man to have in the White House as President of the United States of America.

<p>That doesn't mean he won't talk a good game. He gets up on both sides of the bed every morning. He is disappointing because he lacks a vision, but he is dangerous because he can fake a vision. And the American people are hungry for a vision contest about what kind of country we will have in the year 2000 and beyond.

<p>We must not present them with a choice between a Democratic President faking a vision and a Republican nominee who is too decent to fake one. President Clinton is rejoicing, and Speaker Gephardt is measuring his new office.

<p>Let me ask you to imagine what will happen next October. There will be a presidential debate. Forty million Americans will be watching. We know what Bill Clinton will do. Someone will ask him a question. He'll move out from behind the podium and walk over to the questioner. He feels the questioner's pain. He gives a very good answer. If the Republican nominee's response is to start talking about how to get a bill out of a subcommittee, or OMBs and CBOs, Bill Clinton will be President and Dick Gephardt will be ready to take the Speaker's chair.

<p>That is why the Republican Party needs a wake-up call.

<p>We must nominate someone who can paint a picture of the future based upon conservative principles that is brighter and more compelling than the picture Bill Clinton paints based upon whatever he woke up believing that day.

<p>It is time for a new generation of leadership.

<p>Losing the White House, losing the House of Representatives -- losses that would have been laughed at a few months ago -- are, all of a sudden, part of the Republican conversation. There is a surprising number of Republicans who make themselves feel better by assuming that even if Bill Clinton is re-elected, Newt Gingrich will continue moving the revolution forward as Speaker of the House.

<p>But where is it written in stone that Newt Gingrich will be Speaker in 1997?  The upcoming race will be a referendum on the Republican agenda. Our nominee's job will be to persuade more than half of America that the surest course into the new century is with a Republican government: a Republican President and a Republican Congress.

<p>If the nominee is unable to articulate the vision of the revolution, he will not only fail to win the White House, but could drag others to defeat with him, putting the House and the revolution itself at risk. With the increase we have seen in straight ticket voting in the last few elections, this prospect is now more likely than ever.

<p>Whether Republicans like it or not, Bill Clinton will make the 1996 election about principles and values -- he already is doing so -- not just about policy. So the standard bearer of our party had better be a leader who can articulate both the party's vision and the complete message of the Republican revolution.

<p>I am the only candidate with a realistic chance of winning the nomination who can defeat President Clinton by pitting against his campaign rhetoric a true vision of the country's future that can capture not only the minds, but the hearts of the American people.

<p><b>A Rising, Shining America</b><p>

The goal of the Republican revolution is not just to balance the budget, but to renew our institutions and rebuild America.

<p>This is the America I can see in the next century:<ul>

<li>An America in which parents can drop their children off at school in the morning, confident that they will be safe and that they will learn.

<li>An America in which you are not afraid to take a walk in your own neighborhood after dark.

<li>An America in which the number of abortions and divorces is declining, where families stick together, and fathers stick around.

<li>An America with a 4 percent home mortgage rate so that a working family can afford its home and where there's a good new job for every job that disappears.

<li>An America strong enough to defend itself and wise enough not to become involved in anyone else's civil war unless we are prepared to pick one side and win the war.

<li>An America in which our first thought about each other is something other than the color of our skin.

<li>An America where we are not ashamed but proud to call ourselves "One Nation Under God."

<li>An America where instead of constant complaining about what is on TV, we can almost hear millions of TVs clicking off as families spend more time together and parents actually raise their children.
</ul><p><b>
The New Promise of American Life: Changing the Way We Think</b><p>

To build the good society in the new century, we must change dramatically our thinking about how we get there. For most of this last century, we have measured our progress by a beautiful idea called the promise of American life: the idea that, in America, tomorrow will be better than today and that every single one of us will have an opportunity to be a part of that future. But whenever we have said "We must do more" to extend the promise of American life to more people, "we" has always meant "Washington."  More from Washington has been the thinking that has dominated our civic life since the New Deal and the Great Society. The failures that have resulted from this kind of thinking are now too obvious to ignore. Republicans have successfully made the case against this view of government. We have convinced the public that they need less government in their lives. But less government is only half the equation. To move ahead, to create a new agenda for our party and for our country, we need to talk about the other half of the equation: Less from Washington has to go hand in hand with more from ourselves.

<p>The Republican revolution, after all, was never just about dismantling Washington, D.C. That was a necessary step, but only a first step. What the revolution is also about is making it easier for Americans to rebuild those institutions that bind us together: the family, the neighborhood, the church, the synagogue, the school, and the community. And, finally, it is about putting those institutions to work.

<p>That is the central message of my campaign. And I believe it must be the heart of the Republican agenda leading to November. The Clinton re-election strategy is predicated on the idea of a Republican Party that talks only of tearing things down and taking things away. We must not fall into his trap, not only because this is the way to lose, but, more important, because this would be a betrayal of our responsibility to articulate a positive vision for rebuilding America.

<p>Less from Washington and more from ourselves is a difficult message, and an inconvenient one. But it is time to tell the truth. The answers to many of our most serious problems are not in legislative solutions and are not in Washington, D.C. And any political leader who shrinks from speaking this truth does not deserve the nomination of the party of the revolution.


<p>In 1994, I edited, together with Checker Finn, a book of essays entitled <i>The New Promise of American Life.</i> Our purpose was to present a picture of what America would look like if we reversed our thinking and moved more responsibility out of Washington. This past fall I published a book, <i>We Know What To Do,</i> a collection of stories of the most interesting men and women I met on an eight-week drive across America. All of these are examples of my belief that we know exactly what to do and thousands are already doing it: Father Jerry Hill, who runs the Austin Street Shelter in Dallas; Rev. Henry Delaney, a 500-pound minister who took back an inner-city street in Savannah; the police chief of Charleston, Reuben Greenberg; Sister Jennie and her Puente Learning Center in Los Angeles. Their stories illustrate how to replace the current failed systems, and they demonstrate that it takes a bigger heart to say "I will help you" than "I will lobby the government to help you."

<p><b>Less from Washington, More from Ourselves: A Citizenship Agenda</b><p>

<p>Often, when I am in Washington, I am asked why I would want to come here as President if I simply want to send everything back home. My answer is that I am not seeking the job of President of Washington, D.C. I want to be President of the whole country.

<p>Less from Washington and more from us is not a Washington message, of course. But it is the theme that, as President, will define my agenda, guide my thinking, and help a Republican administration focus on the most important issues: citizenship, personal responsibility, and giving Americans more control over their own lives. We need to stop studying the problems and start solving them. We need a sense of urgency that permeates what we do today, and every day, because so much is at stake. We need a President who is determined enough, even stubborn enough, not to let special interests and defenders of the failed status quo get in the way of a citizenship agenda that will eliminate the obstacles standing between the American people and all that they can be -- for themselves, for their families, and for their communities. I intend to throw myself into the fulfillment of this agenda with everything I have, tolerating no institutional excuses or bureaucratic delays.

<p>Here is what I would do as first President of the next century to give us less from Washington.

<p><b>An Entrepreneurial Economy and Vouchers for Job Training.</b> My first goal would be to remove the barriers that stand in the way of unleashing entrepreneurial creativity and community action. I will know I have succeeded when creating a new job becomes easier than getting an unemployment check. I would focus on the job spigot instead of the job drain, so that every year we would create enough new jobs to replace the ones we are losing. By entirely abolishing the capital gains tax and drastically simplifying our tax code, and by turning the $25 billion in federal job training programs into job training vouchers for workers changing jobs, we would transform a bureaucratic and stifling industrial age environment into one that is flexible and responsive to the changing needs of an America on the threshold of a new century.
<p>
I am comfortable talking about these ideas because I've done what I think every politician should be forced to do: lived under the rules I helped create. In 1987, after I left the governor's office in Tennessee, I helped start a company that today employs 1,200 people. So I know what is involved in starting a new business. And I know what removing Washington's barriers would do to encourage others to start new businesses of their own.
<p>
<b>A GI Bill for Kids.</b> But nothing will change in this country until we change an educational system that keeps poor children trapped in failed schools where they can't learn and from which they cannot escape. In the 1960s, George Wallace stood in the courthouse door telling the black children of Alabama they could not get in. Today, the teachers' unions and politicians beholden to them are standing in the school doors telling poor children they cannot get out.
<p>
Fighting this opposition will be one of our toughest challenges. I know. I fought the teachers' union in Tennessee for a year and a half in order to pay teachers more for teaching well. They beat me once, but I came back and succeeded. I am prepared to do it again. So step number one is to abolish the U.S. Department of Education and put responsibility for education back where it belongs, in the families and in the classrooms. And to make it easier for middle- and low-income parents to have a choice about where their children go to school, I would introduce a $1 billion GI Bill for Kids that would provide scholarships for children who need them.
<p>
<b>Put Welfare Decisions in the Hands of Citizens.</b> In the area of welfare, there is widespread consensus that it needs to be reformed. Walking in New Hampshire, I met a couple that had just returned from the welfare office, where they were encouraged to separate in order to get higher welfare benefits. This is an example of the compassion by bureaucracy that has undermined personal responsibility and our social responsibility for those in need. Ending welfare as an entitlement is a first step, but Congress has still ended up with a bill that runs more than 800 pages full of rules and regulations. Less from Washington and more from us means going beyond block grants and ending entirely Washington's involvement in caring for those in need.
<p>
Giving communities and individuals a real stake in how we help the poor means keeping the money that is now sent to Washington at home and letting communities create their own nonprofit corporations so they can decide how to help people in need. We also should have a tax credit, as Senator Coats has suggested, so that Americans can directly support local charities instead of handing the money over to the federal tax collector.
<p>
<b>Cut Their Pay and Send Them Home.</b> But it is very hard to change the bankrupt culture of Washington if you are the culture of Washington. That is why we need a part-time citizen Congress. The best way for Congress to understand the citizenship agenda is to begin practicing it by spending less time in Washington and more time in their communities. I would cut the pay of Congress in half and send them home for half the year. Even a Republican Congress would be a better Congress if it were a part-time citizen Congress. To accelerate this fundamental change in our political system, I would lead the national call for term limits and an end to the million dollar pensions that reward members of Congress for making politics a lifetime career.
<p>
<b>What Would America Look Like?</b>

<p>Earlier this week, the New York Times published a funny piece about my red and black plaid shirt. The Times pointed out that in many places, the shirt is better known than I am. That shirt, which I wore as I walked across Tennessee in 1978, and which I have worn as I walked across New Hampshire this summer, has been the butt of many jokes. But there is a serious point I am trying to make with my plaid shirt, too.

<p>It stands for the folks I've been talking to for the past two years in neighborhoods, churches, schools, and communities from one end of our nation to the other. I've found far more wisdom in the plaid shirts of America than in all the empty suits in Washington. The folks in plaid shirts understand what's wrong with America, and more important, they know what to do to fix it.

<p>I am often asked: After these changes come about, who would help the poor?  Who would teach the children who need the most help?  Who would help the homeless?

<p>Across America, I've seen firsthand what works. It is Americans in their everyday lives, doing extraordinary things in suburbs as well as in the trenches of our inner cities, giving us a glimpse of what America could look like.<ul>

<li><b>In Dallas,</b> Father Jerry Hill. Father Hill was outraged that the federal government was paying $446 a month to drug addicts who then wanted to come into his shelter. "How can I help them," he says, "when they have that kind of support for their dependency?"

<p><li><b>In Savannah,</b> Rev. Henry Delaney. "Why don't they ask me about welfare?"  he said to me. "I work every day with people who need help. I know what to do."

<p><li><b>In Charleston,</b> Police Chief Reuben Greenberg. He fought for two years for permission to throw known crack dealers out of housing projects so that single mothers who were following the law could live there in safety.

<p><li><b>In Milwaukee,</b> the remarkable people who helped give low-income parents a voucher so that their children would not be stuck in a bad school. When the courts stopped the program Governor Thompson had instituted just after the school year had begun, the community rushed to its defense. There was an emergency campaign which raised $1.8 million to send almost 5,000 children from poor families to the private schools of their parents' choosing -- complete with a talk show host offering to match up to $1,000 in donations with his own funds, and an elderly couple celebrating 52 years of marriage by sending in the $50 they had set aside for an anniversary present. Bill Bennett and I visited these schools in September, and what we saw were parents and teachers who, despite the court order and despite the media attention, wanted to get the best education they could for their children. They had been given an opportunity to make decisions for themselves and their children, to act as involved citizens, and they were seizing it.</ul>

<p>These stories are not isolated examples. They are the American way of life. They are the tinder for a prairie fire of personal and social responsibility that, with lots of encouragement, could sweep across our country.

<p>The next President needs to be a little bit of a preacher willing to say the most important words the first President of the next century can say: We should spend less time trying to figure out what the government owes us and who to blame for what goes wrong and more time accepting personal responsibility for the consequences of our own actions.

<p>If our children are running around the streets where we live, we should go get them. If they are not learning to read, we should read to them. My first library card came from my mother, not from the President of the United States. If the television is trash, we should turn it off. If the babies in a Detroit hospital are born already exposed to cocaine because their mothers are crack addicts, we can shoot down a drug plane and appoint a new czar, but in the end, the problem is not in Washington; it is in Detroit.

<p>A few months ago, I visited Mt. Dora, a wonderful little community in Florida. As I was leaving, a reporter told me an eighth grader had murdered a classmate. The reporter then asked me what I would do about that as President. The answer a Senator might give is: Pass a federal law against guns in schools. But I replied: The answer is not in Washington; the answer is in Mt. Dora. Only the families, neighborhoods, churches, and schools of Mt. Dora can keep a tragedy like that from happening again.
<p>
<b>The Role of the Presidency</b>
<p>
Earlier I mentioned how I have been asked why I would want to come to Washington to serve as President if I think we should move so much out of Washington. To ask this question is to fundamentally misunderstand the role of the presidency. We seem to be forgetting what the job of the President actually is. The President is the nation's agenda setter. A President has the power to move a crisis to the center of the public debate and to national attention, and to energize millions of Americans to deliver the solutions.

<p>But in my administration, the opportunity to educate, persuade, and motivate through the megaphone that our Constitution and the TV age have given the President will be devoted to my citizenship agenda.

<p>When I say I am an outsider, it is not because I don't know Washington, but because I know unequivocally that the solutions are outside Washington. I don't trust Washington solutions, and I don't trust Washington predictions.

<p>The majority of Republican primary voters are looking for a new generation of leadership that will build on the beginnings of the Republican revolution and carry it forward to the next century. I believe I will be that candidate.

<p>The choice voters will face, as I said at the outset of this speech, is a Republican Party that persists in speaking only about legislation and budgets versus a Republican Party that shifts the agenda to one of citizens, communities, families, churches, synagogues, and schools. Once that candidate, who can carry the citizenship agenda, has been brought to the forefront, the alternative will suddenly become clear, and the defining political debate will be heard not just on weekend talk shows, but in front of millions of voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, throughout New England, across the South and the rest of the country.

<p>I intend to be that alternative because I will advance what I think is the right agenda and the winning agenda for the Republican future.

<p>So the Republican nominating process of 1996 really begins this week. It is a contest about where the country will go and who can paint the most compelling picture of its future. My job -- our job -- is to ensure that voters have the right choice in that contest so that, three months from now, we are setting the agenda rather than reacting defensively to an agenda set by Bill Clinton. And ten months from now, if we are the ones who set the agenda, we will have a truly historic opportunity to lead the Republican revolution into the next century.

WHY CONGRESS SHOULD NOT UNDERMINE THE PRESIDENTIAL POWER OF
APPOINTMENT -- Heritage </title>

<h3><I><center>WHY CONGRESS SHOULD NOT UNDERMINE THE PRESIDENTIAL POWER OF APPOINTMENT</H3></i>
<p>
By Patrick Korten<p>
</center>Patrick Korten was Executive Assistant Director for Policy and Communications at the U.S. Office
of Personnel Management during the Reagan Administration.<center><p>

Backgrounder No. 1044<br>
July 24, 1995<br>
</center><hr size=3 width=30%><p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
  Having trimmed the size of its own politically appointed staff earlier this year, Congress is
moving toward enacting  legislation aimed at bringing about a sharp reduction in the number of
political appointees in the Clinton Administration. In doing so, however, Congress is not looking
closely at the consequences of its action.
<p>
  Specifically, the budget resolution recently adopted by Congress directs that the number of
political appointees in the executive branch be reduced by nearly a third, from the current level of
approximately 2,800 to just 2,000. It will be up to the authorizing committees either to implement this
change or to find other ways to reduce the budget outlays by the amount this move supposedly will
save.
<p>
    However, there will be two unintended consequences. First, since no overall reductions are
made in the size of the executive branch bureaucracy, no money will be saved by eliminating 800
political appointees. Their slots simply will be filled by career civil servants. Second, because these
slots will be filled by members of the career bureaucracy, Congress's action will solidify the grip of
Washington's "permanent government" on the operation of the federal establishment.
<p>
    While it is understandable that a conservative Republican Congress would want to see fewer
liberal Democratic appointees responsible to a Democratic President, this congressional effort
unwisely undermines legitimate presidential authority and the ability of the President to implement his
policy agenda -- and thus his responsibility to the American electorate.
<p>
    Paradoxically, the position taken by the Budget Committee Republicans parallels almost
precisely the 1988 recommendation of the National Commission on the Public Service to incoming
President George Bush that the number of political appointees be reduced from 3,000 (the level at that
time) to 2,000. Among the members of this commission, which was chaired by former Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, were such prominent liberals as Robert McNamara, Walter
Mondale, Edmund Muskie, Elliot Richardson, and Donna Shalala. In other words, it was dominated
by the very people who had held (or, in Shalala's case, soon would hold) top federal positions and
had played a decisive role in creating the federal leviathan that exists today:  scores of big-government programs and agencies brought to life in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.
<p>
    The principal rationale for this recommendation was that putting political appointees in
positions of authority over career civil servants discourages "talented young men and women" in the
career bureaucracy. The commission trotted out the time-worn complaint from Washington's
powerful "public administration community":  political appointees are not around long enough to
learn their jobs well enough before leaving for another slot somewhere else. Therefore, it is better for
the President to have fewer of them.
<p>

<b>ARE THERE TOO MANY POLITICAL APPOINTEES?</b>
<p>
    There is, of course, occasional resentment among longtime career civil servants when political
appointees get high-ranking jobs they themselves had wanted. Although it certainly is true that
executive branch political appointees tend to have more influence than the average federal jobholder
(which is why their positions are defined in law and regulation as "policy-determining or policy-influencing"), their numbers remain minuscule. They certainly are not numerous enough to pose a
significant obstacle to ambitious career civil servants looking to advance.
<p>
    Consider the actual numerical strength of the political appointees targeted by the budget
resolution language:  non-career Senior Executive Service (SES) members and Schedule C employees.
The Civil Service Reform Act of 1979 requires that no more than 10 percent of SES positions be held
by non-career appointees. The proportion may be higher in a specific agency but cannot exceed 25
percent. Schedule C slots number fewer than 2,000 government-wide -- less than one one-thousandth of
the federal government's 2.1 million non-postal civilian workers. Taken together, non-career SES and
Schedule C employees represent only a drop in an ocean of career bureaucrats. By contrast, virtually all
congressional employees on Members' and committee staffs are political appointees.
<p>
    Congress clearly should protect the integrity of the career civil service -- for example, by
ensuring that civil service laws, rules, and regulations are enforced vigorously and that hiring and
promotion are fair and equitable. But the existence of a small and well-defined political cadre in the
executive branch is not a threat to the system's integrity. Rather, one of the most insidious and
corrosive abuses of the career civil service is a direct result of a law enacted by Congress in the
1940s. The Ramspeck Act allows former congressional staff employees to move into career
government jobs while avoiding the competitive appointment process. Remarkably, for all its progress
in the area of internal reform, the new Congress has left this egregious assault on the career service
virtually intact.
<p>
    To ensure the integrity of the federal civil service system, Congress should recognize and
endorse the distinction between, and the importance of, career and political employees. And it should
require that whenever highly paid congressional staffers move to the executive branch, they move into
positions that are clearly defined as political, rather than into positions reserved for career civil
servants.
<p>
    Congress should not undermine the President's ability to set his own agenda or his right to fill
key policy positions with men and women in whom he places particular trust. To do otherwise not
only compromises the ability of a President to carry out his responsibilities in a democratic system,
but also strengthens the hand of a powerful, entrenched career bureaucracy which tends to resist
change and innovation.
<p>

<b>THE ROLE OF POLITICAL APPOINTEES</b>
<p>
    To understand the impact of Congress's proposed cuts in politically appointed positions, one
needs to break down the totals into the categories of political appointees. There are three main
groups:  presidential appointments requiring Senate confirmation (PAS positions) and non-career
Senior Executive Service (SES) and Schedule C appointees.
<p>
    During the Reagan Administration, approximately 540 presidential appointments required
confirmation. During the past decade, Congress has created more than 100 additional positions in this
category, and the total is now more than 650. These are the top policy-making jobs in the federal
government and are held by Cabinet secretaries, deputy and assistant secretaries, heads of
independent agencies, and members of independent commissions and similar bodies. No one
questions that these should be people in whom a President has personal confidence and who, for the
most part, cannot be drawn from the career service.
<p>
    Non-career SES appointees currently number about 720, and the size of this category is
limited by a formula in the Civil Service Reform Act. They also serve in sensitive policy-making or
policy-influencing positions, typically with major responsibility for policy development, public affairs,
law, and other areas in which they are expected to be strong advocates of administration policy.
Because career civil servants must serve administrations of different parties from one term to the next,
they obviously should not be required to fill an advocacy role in these areas.
<p>
    The third category, Schedule C appointees, covers approximately 1,500 individuals in
positions requiring a politically sensitive relationship with one of the more senior appointees described
above:  confidential assistants, personal secretaries, senior policy advisors and assistants, and (in
smaller agencies) public affairs directors, general counsels, and so on. The roles they play in
supporting key political officials of the executive branch are roughly comparable to those of
congressional legislative and press aides. No Member of Congress would dream of giving such
responsibility to employees who remained in these jobs regardless of the political or philosophical
persuasion of whoever was representing the state or district in question.
<p>

<b>A SENSIBLE CONGRESSIONAL PERSONNEL POLICY</b>
<p>
    Members of Congress have an interest in making sure that the federal government is run
efficiently and effectively. Regardless of political party, they have an interest in seeing to it that the
President of the United States can manage the government without having to contend with the sorts
of institutional disabilities that are caused by not having the right people, or enough of the right
people, in the agencies he must operate. Members of Congress also have an interest in making sure
that executive branch witnesses who testify before them can speak with authority on the
administration's position. It does not help the legislative process for lawmakers to be second-guessing
what the administration really means or really wants in an area of policy. Such a situation advances
nobody's agenda -- except possibly the agenda of career staff determined to oppose, quietly but
strongly, what the President and his advisors are trying to accomplish. This is not good government.
It is quite the opposite. In crafting federal personnel policy, Congress should always maintain a clear
distinction between political and career staff, respecting the different and equally important missions
and functions of both.
<p>
    Specifically:
<p><ul>
<li>Congress should not compromise the right of a President to pick his own people. No matter
who occupies the Oval Office, a fundamental principle is at stake. A reasonable number of political
appointees are crucial to any President's success in carrying out his electoral mandate. The President
and Vice President are the only officials elected by a vote of all Americans. They are not beholden to
the interests of one state, or of one congressional district. They are elected by all the people and
represent the interests of all the people. No President can fulfill his mandate alone or with only a
handful of staffers in the West Wing of the White House. Nor can his Cabinet secretaries fulfill their
duty to implement his policies without a cadre of like-minded, personally committed political
appointees at the agency level.
<p>
<li>Conservatives in Congress should learn from and honor the example of President Ronald Reagan's
successful experience in personnel management. The managerial watchword in the Reagan White
House was "Personnel is Policy."  Everyone clearly understood that it was never enough simply to
announce a policy, expecting that the plodding, gargantuan federal establishment would respond like
a turbocharged V-8. The right people had to be in key positions throughout the government to make
things happen. Personnel selections thus were made with great care, with the White House looking
not only for management competence, but also for commitment to the President's program and the
kind of personal toughness and resolve that would be necessary to lead an agency in the right
direction. The fact that not every appointment turned out perfectly does not diminish the crucial
importance of making every effort to put the right people in the right jobs and to have enough of them
to get the job done.
<p><li>
While conservatives in Congress disagree with much that the Clinton Administration is doing, or
trying to do, the way to deal with such policy differences is by confronting them directly in the
legislative process, not by trying to weaken the Administration by trimming the number of political
appointees. Moreover, conservatives in Congress should realize that this is a double-edged sword:  a
sharp reduction in political slots today will be difficult, if not impossible, to undo in a few years if a
more conservative President takes office. Using political appointees in key policy jobs improves the
process of government. Not only is having people in place, regardless of their political party or
philosophical orientation, who can speak for, answer for, and defend the President's policy in
congressional hearings and other public forums good from a management standpoint; it is a highly
desirable feature of America's representative democracy.
<p><li>
Congress should not compromise the President's ability to carry out his agenda. Political
appointees are selected because they share the President's philosophy and agenda. They serve at the
pleasure of the President, can be fired at any time and for any reason, and have no civil service job
protection. They thus are acutely sensitive to the political direction set by the President. These
appointees give the President the support he needs in crucial congressional hearings, speaking for him
in a direct way and pressing his case on Capitol Hill. They also play the key role in making the
bureaucracy responsive to the President's wishes. There can be no more worthwhile management goal
than ensuring that the federal bureaucracy is responsive to the direction set by the highest elected
official in the land.
<p><li>
Congress should not strengthen the power of the permanent government bureaucracy. The
real, though largely unspoken, reason for the public administration community's hostility to political
appointees, whether liberal or conservative, is both simple and understandable:  these appointees
represent a force seeking real change, sometimes even upheaval. Regardless of which party controls
the White House, the President's immediate staff view themselves as his agents in the struggle to
fulfill his campaign promises and other commitments. Thus, their agenda often contrasts sharply with
that of the career civil servant, whose loyalty tends to be to the institution and who has spent years
(even decades) at an agency, creating and shaping the programs whose direction, size, or very
existence may now be under attack.
<p></ul>
Without saying so, the Volcker Commission's priority was to structure the civil service so as to
preserve and protect the vast bureaucracies that its own members had played such an important role
in creating. Those who share this objective view with nearly equal horror both the Reagan
Administration's efforts to cut the size, scope, and reach of government and the Clinton
Administration's campaign to "reinvent" government in order to make it more efficient.
<p>


<b>MAINTAINING THE LINE BETWEEN CAREER AND POLITICAL STAFF</b>
<p>
Congress should recognize the fact that America's representative democracy has long included
both political and career employees with distinct and equally important roles to play. Political
employees ensure that the will of the people, expressed in quadrennial national elections, is reflected
in the way government does its work. These employees, proudly and unapologetically, should be
advocates for the President's program. Congress should respect this because only these individuals
can fulfill this responsibility. Career employees, on the other hand, provide continuity, administrative
expertise, and institutional memory that can help the President and his appointees avoid repeating old
mistakes. Wise Members of Congress would not wish to return to a Jacksonian spoils system in
which political employees held all the jobs. But neither would they want a federal government in
which career employees, who enjoy civil service protection, hold all the jobs except for a few Cabinet
posts. A functional, effective executive branch needs both political appointees and career civil
servants.
<p>
    It is worth noting that the principle of having both political and career officials with distinct
roles in the executive branch is being undermined by the Ramspeck Act. Under this law, people who
have worked on congressional staffs for at least three years can be selected noncompetitively for
career jobs in the executive branch if their Representatives or Senators leave office. This happens
regularly in both Democratic and Republican Administrations, and it is time to end the practice. Since
last fall's wholesale defeat of scores of Democratic Members and the retirement of many others,
hundreds of these highly political staff employees have been able to move quietly into jobs that are
supposed to be held by career civil servants. A proper respect for the distinction between the roles of
political and career officials would place these staffers in political, not career, jobs. It is not the
function of a competitive civil service to be a haven for activists with a strong political agenda. Those
who do have such an agenda and who insist on trying to advance it should be subject to the risks and
responsibilities of political appointment. That is fair to the career civil servant and to the American
taxpayer.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
    Members of Congress considering proposed personnel cuts must realize that reducing the
number of executive branch political appointees by 800 simply will mean that those jobs will be taken
over by members of the career bureaucracy -- the permanent government. Without the guidance and
direction of a sufficient number of appointees responsible to the President, the results inevitably will
be to frustrate change and innovation and to enhance the power of the government leviathan.
<p>
    During the 1980s, American public television aired a series imported from Britain called
"Yes, Minister."  It depicted, in often hilarious fashion, how the British career bureaucracy had
raised to a fine art the process of sealing off and co-opting political ministers from the moment they
arrived on the job. While amusing, the series was painfully close to the truth, since government
ministers in Great Britain at that time were unable to hire any political assistants. Key officials in the
Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher made a point of trying to move in
America's direction when it came to giving their top political officials the ability to hire like-minded
people for their staffs. They recognized clearly that even the toughest political appointee cannot hope
to have any real impact if forced to rely exclusively on career bureaucrats. New Members of
Congress, swept into office by voters demanding fundamental change and the reining in of the
Washington establishment, should not let their opposition to the policies of the current White House
blind them to the importance of a President's being able to set policy direction for the executive
branch. It would be ironic indeed if a Congress wishing to carry out the people's demand for change
were to enact a personnel policy that delivered so much additional power into the hands of
Washington's permanent government.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+2">L</FONT></B>amar Alexander is an unorthodox, populist, and persuasive Republican
leader. That is why I gladly moved from Washington to Nashville
to work on his presidential campaign, and why I believe he will
be the party's nominee in 1996. 

<P>
Our legislative branch's leadership
of national government is a temporary (albeit fascinating) phenomenon.
But we need our next president to set the agenda, not take his
cues from Congress. Conservatives should be looking for a candidate
who can present a bold design for government along with the ability
to execute it. 

<P>
Lamar Alexander has the imagination, energy, and
executive background to do both. The major themes of his campaign-growth,
freedom, and personal responsibility-are indisputably conservative.
But what distinguishes him is his unorthodox approach to politics,
his populist style of governance, and his skills of persuasion.


<P>
<B>Unorthodox.</B> In 1978, Alexander was elected governor of Tennessee,
only the third Republican to win that office this century. Nothing
that followed was typical, either. He began his crusade to improve
Tennessee's pitiful public-school system by introducing merit
pay and master teachers, relatively radical notions that weakened
the teacher unions. The National Education Association fought
him vigorously. He ignored warnings that it was hopeless, fought
back, and won. 

<P>
Alexander broke new ground on other issues. At
a time when most governors were using state airplanes to fly to
Washington, Alexander closed Tennessee's D.C. office altogether.
He chided other governors for behaving like senators. As early
as 1981, he advised President Reagan to end the federal role in
education. Four years later, he called two relatively unknown
congressmen named Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott and invited them
to join a small group of GOP governors to plot a united strategy
for second stage of the Reagan Revolution. 

<P>
He showed the same
verve when he arrived at the Department of Education in 1991.
By then, the intellectual excitement of the Bill Bennett years
had passed, and the Bush administration's school-choice agenda
amounted to little more than photo-ops with local education activists.
Alexander understood that school choice-despised by country-club
Republicans and misunderstood by most suburbanites-was at risk
of becoming a political loser. His &quot;America 2000&quot; program
was a true grass-roots initiative that breathed life into education
reform. Conventional wisdom dubbed it a quirky agenda that offered
little federal legislation. But it tapped into a decentralization
movement that remains the only path to school choice. His 1992
school-choice bill was a true voucher program for public, private,
and parochial schools, but the Democrats in Congress made sure
it never came to a vote. 

<P>
<B>Populist.</B> Alexander's well-publicized
assault on Congress-&quot;cut their pay and send them home&quot;-is
no mere slogan. It reveals his deep sympathy with the populism
that has justifiably become the bedrock of conservative politics.
An unapologetic champion of term limits, he sincerely believes
that a citizen legislature would transform the character of the
federal government. With none of Ross Perot's demagoguery, Alexander
offers a mature, but no less revolutionary, brand of popular discontent
with government in Washington. 

<P>
While some Republicans still waver
on the wisdom of block grants, Alexander is advancing the idea
both philosophically and practically. He suggests ending the federal
role in education, welfare, and job training altogether. He applauded
the Supreme Court decision striking down the 1990 Gun-Free Schools
Zone Act, an attempt to federalize local responsibility that every
GOP senator supported. &quot;We know what to do&quot; is the central
tenet of his populist conservative political theory, which holds
that Americans should be given the freedom to make decisions about
their own lives. Although every Republican will offer bromides
about &quot;states' rights&quot; or &quot;new federalism&quot;
during the coming months, Alexander's own policy prescriptions
suggest a fully conceived populist vision.

<P>
<B>Persuasive.</B> If conservatives
are to remake government, we must do more than merely express
support for conservative ideas. We must also win over others not
fully in our camp. It didn't take much leadership to point out
that the Clinton health-care plan was a socialistic fantasy. The
political challenge was to convince half the nation-including
many Democrats-that the Clinton plan was bad medicine. 

<P>
The job
of president is almost entirely about setting a principled agenda
and then persuading the country of its wisdom. Alexander's public
career has prepared him to do just that. As governor, he led a
Democratic legislature toward his goals. When 38 governors competed
to get GM's Saturn division to build its plant in their states,
Tennessee won, in part because Alexander convinced the company's
executives that a right-to-work state with school choice, merit
pay, and no income tax was the best environment for business.
No tax breaks were involved. 

<P>
As the chairman of the National Governors
Association, he transformed its agenda by convincing fellow members-including
Bill Clinton, John Sununu, Dick Thornburgh, and Michael Dukakis-that
they should end their obsession with Washington issues and focus
on state matters instead. 

<P>
A president who is at once unorthodox,
populist, and persuasive will quickly establish a very different
type of presidency. But that is exactly what conservatives and
libertarians should be looking for next year.The danger we face
is that, with an irreparably damaged president in the White House,
Republicans will try to coast to victory in 1996 on a poll-driven
platform of GOP boilerplate.  Alexander will offer none of that
blandness. He governed Tennessee in the 1980s in much the same
way that Wisconsin's Tommy Thompson and Michigan's John Engler
govern in the 1990s. True, his view of the role of the federal
government may be at odds with much of established Washington.
But it is a view understood and applauded around the country.

<CENTER><B>Paul Gottfried on Patrick Buchanan</B></CENTER>
<P>
The announcement by Pat Buchanan of his candidacy for the Republican
presidential nomination has done more to change the Republican
race than has the entry of any other candidate. More than any
other contender, Buchanan represents the populist right and has
fought all of its enemies. He has tangled with the liberal media;
the gay, feminist, and civil-rights lobbies; and the corporate
economic interests allied with big government. He has also dished
out, in his provocative speeches and blistering columns, fully
as much as he has taken. There is a certain bulldog tenacity about
him that even his bitterest opponents acknowledge. When Buchanan
believes he has been unfairly attacked, he stands his ground,
and he shows as much civility or incivility to his critics as
they display toward him. In 1992, I thought that he should have
done more to defuse accusations of being anti-Jewish, a charge
that plagued him particularly after he had linked support for
the Gulf War to the activities of Israel's &quot;amen corner.&quot;
But Buchanan would not apologize for what he--and others, including
commentators Michael Kinsley and Rabbi Jacob Neusner-took to be
a false charge. As he told his Jewish advisers, he would not dignify
a &quot;libel&quot; charge by responding to it. 

<P>No, I do not always
agree with Buchanan's positions, but they are honestly stated
and consistently held. Unlike senators Gramm and Dole, he has
not waffled on affirmative action or aid to illegal aliens, which
Buchanan has always opposed. And like Alan Keyes, but unlike most
of the other Republican candidates, he is genuinely opposed to
abortion. 

<P>
Equally important to me are the populist themes that
resonate in his campaigns. In the Wall Street Journal in 1993,
Irving Kristol predicted the inevitable success of a national
leader carrying out Buchanan's ideas. Buchanan's passionate concerns-violent
crime, immigration controls, the disintegration of morals, and
the disappearing jobs of American workers-are now, according to
Kristol, widely shared. New York cabdrivers, even those from the
Third World, express most of these concerns with equal vehemence.
Kristol is no friend of Buchanan or his candidacy, but he does
recognize the timeliness of his populist themes-and the foolishness
of those who would resist them. 

<P>
Buchanan belongs to a movement
that is also sweeping Europe. In Italy, Austria, and Germany,
there is a surging populist protest against capricious public
administration. There is also a growing demand that government
bring itself into line with the beliefs and traditions of those
it is intended to serve. Democracy, populists maintain, is not
an exercise in sensitivity training or the formulation of administrative
policy. It is the practice of self-government by self-identified
communities, whether regional or national. 

<P>
When the popular will
seeks to affirm traditional morality or limit the political community,
but is disregarded or overruled judicially, then both democracy
and citizenship are devalued. This is now a regular occurrence
in the U.S. The populist call for both political accountability
and true self-government has joined a conservative goal: the defense
of family and traditional communities endangered by a therapeutic
managerial state. 

<P>
Buchanan personifies the populist revolt against
this. Unlike neoconservatives and gentrified Republicans, he concedes
nothing, rhetorically or programmatically. He calls for seismic
change: devolution of power to states and open confrontation with
moral and cultural revolutionaries posing as value-free judges
or public servants. As president, he would not merely dicker with
liberal administrators. He would find ways to dispatch them and,
wherever possible, dismantle their agencies. 

<P>
Buchanan's spiritedness
and unwavering conviction persuade me that he would make a difference
as president. Unlike Ronald Reagan, he would not leave the Washington
power structure as he found it. He would make strenuous efforts
to restore the dual federalism established by our founders. 

<P>Buchanan
knows that genuine democracy must come from below. It cannot be
mandated from Washington or, in imperialist fashion, imposed abroad.
In our own country, democracy is an ideal to be recaptured, not
a blueprint to be forced on other nations. 

<P>
I doubt that Buchanan
would be a rigidly isolationist president. His stern warnings
against foreign entanglements have a constructive aim. He rightly
fears that our own society is deteriorating in many ways. Especially
now that our communist enemy is gone, it may be best to work on
domestic problems instead of shouldering the burdens of other
peoples.  

<P>
Nor should we encourage unskilled workers from less
developed lands to immigrate, take advantage of our social services,
and displace those most at risk in our own work force. America,
as Buchanan sees it, should hope neither to remake nor to absorb
the rest of humanity. In contrast to the nationalism expressed
by Ben Wattenberg, one of his frequent debating partners, Buchanan's
nationalism has no global imperative and is respectful of cultural
differences. Because of his feisty and principled character and
his democratic counterrevolutionary vision, I shall cast my own
vote in the Republican presidential primary for this modest nationalist.

<CENTER><B>DavidKuo on Bob Dole</B></CENTER>
<P>
The elections of November 1994 did more than usher in the first
conservative Congress in two generations. They also signaled the
public affirmation of a conservative agenda. In so doing, they
forced conservatives to change both their congressional and their
presidential perspectives. Suddenly, long-held conservative hopes
became new-found conservative realities. The balanced budget is
fashionable-the only real question now is whether it will be accomplished
through the budget process or through an amendment to the Constitution.
Federalism is renewed and devolution is the new buzzword. Illegitimacy
is bad and the family needs to be strengthened. As conservatives
consider whom among the presidential candidates to support in
1996, the question is, &quot;Who is best suited to take us to
the next stage of our conservative realignment?&quot; The clear
answer: Bob Dole. 

<P>The next stage of the realignment is not for
communication and symbolism, but for the detailed work of devolving
federal power, strengthening families, and reasserting American
interests abroad. It is a stage for implementing an agenda already
defined. 

<P>
Although some things may have caused conservatives some
angst, the simple fact remains: On every serious issue on our
agenda, Bob Dole is not only on board, he is the leader. 

<P>
This
is not a recent phenomenon. The man now calling for the abolition
of the departments of Commerce, Housing and Urban Development,
Education, and Energy is the same man who voted against creating
both Education and HUD. The man now speaking out against our nation's
social pathologies has a pro-life voting record of nearly 100
percent. The man now advocating a U.S. foreign policy based on
American interests has been one of the leading voices in foreign
policy for years. And the man who has pledged to balance the budget
has made tough choices, year after year, on spending cuts. 

<P>
Today,
Bob Dole is arguably the most respected statesman in the country.
He has proven himself an excellent strategist who remains cool
under fire, a coalition-builder, and a political achiever. He
has demonstrated both the courage and the decisiveness that will
be required to implement our agenda. 

<P>
Too often, conservatives
have belittled and diminished legislative experience as a liability-suggesting
that a man who legislates cannot be trusted with the ideological
mantle. But as Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and even Bill Clinton
have learned, accomplishing-legislating-is difficult business.
Any agenda, however aggressive, however bold, however visionary
is merely an agenda unless it is implemented. But Majority Leader
Dole is not only a legislator, he is a master at getting things
done. And President Dole would be able to translate his experience
and ability into the tough work of reversing 30 years of growth
in the welfare state. 

<P>
Many contend that the president's most important
role is commander-in-chief of our armed forces, and they may be
right. Though Cold War pressures have receded, our recent dalliances
in Somalia, Bosnia, and North Korea testify to the continuing
need for serious and responsive leadership. Bob Dole, who has
emerged as the leading Republican voice in foreign policy, would
bring to the presidency a developed view of world affairs. His
view combines two things: an expansive interpretation of America's
role in the world and a personal and pragmatic understanding of
the dangers of global involvement. 

<P>
For someone who has worked
for both the National Right-to-Life Committee and Empower America,
all of these things are important. But the real source of my attraction
to Dole lies elsewhere. The true reason I believe Bob Dole should
be president of the United States stems from his character. 

<P>
The
presidency helps define the character of the country. People look
to the president for leadership, inspiration, and guidance. The
president should be someone to whom parents can point and tell
their children, &quot;Be like him.&quot; In Bob Dole, parents
could point to someone who served his country in war, overcame
physical infirmities thought to be insurmountable, and dedicated
his life to serving the American people-all good and noble things.
He has also proven himself to be a man who keeps his word.

<P>
In the 1980s, following a decade of turmoil and the &quot;malaise&quot;
presidency, America needed a particular kind of conservatism-an
inspiring conservatism of sweeping visions, a conservatism that
could hasten the downfall of communism abroad and the restoration
of confidence at home. In President Reagan, it had an unparalleled
leader. But America now needs something very different. It needs
a conservatism that is still visionary, but one whose greatest
virtue is belief in community and responsibility. In Bob Dole
it has its rightful leader. His presidency would not only bury
the aberration that is the Clinton presidency, but would also
consolidate the conservative revolution.

<CENTER><B>William E. Dannemeyer on Bob Dornan</B></CENTER>
<P>
True leadership emanates from men who say the right thing at
the right time to the people who need to hear it most. This is
how I think of Bob Dornan. In my mind's eye I return to 1990,
on a typically hot and humid July morning in Washington, D.C.,
where a not-so-typical debate began to boil on the floor of the
House. 

<P>
At issue was the expulsion of Representative Barney Frank,
who had brought shame upon our institution for misjudgments involving
a male friend and prostitute over an 18-month period. As the sponsor
of the resolution to expel Frank, I can tell you that the experience
was one of the most intensely sobering dramas with which I was
ever involved in my 14 years of service in the House. It was not
a time for the timid. Only four members spoke in favor of the
expulsion. Bob Dornan was one of them. 

<P>
Bob began his comments,
&quot;I have not been this nervous in this well in over a 14-year
span in this House.&quot; And then he did something that has become
trademark Dornan, something only courageous men can do under fire.


<P>
Knowing that he stood virtually alone, knowing that ridicule and
contempt would be heaped upon him by Frank's defenders and a vicious
liberal media, Bob turned and looked Barney Frank square in the
eyes, not once turning his attention elsewhere, and said what
had to be said to the man who needed to hear it most: &quot;I
don't care about the details. The devil is in the details. That
is for you lawyers.&#133; I will vote for expelling you because
you did not have the honor or decency to resign.&quot; 

<P>
Bob Dole,
as inspirational as his life has been, would never have shown
such leadership. Phil Gramm would have become invisible. Dick
Lugar would have prayed that the moment would quickly pass. And
Arlen Specter would have defended Frank. Under those circumstances,
not one of these Republican candidates, who all serve in elective
office, would have done what needed to be done or have said what
needed to be said. This is a major reason why I support Bob Dornan
for president. 

<P>
Bob's conservatism is real. It is passionate. And
it is based on a deep and abiding faith in God. I was glad, although
not surprised, to hear Bob inject themes of liberty and virtue
into the presidential debate. Unlike the congressional colleagues
who have become his presidential competitors, Bob actually understands
the historical, moral, and philosophical basis of these themes.
He knows, and has stated, that we cannot be a free people unless
we are a virtuous people. He did not need million-dollar handlers
to tell him that. Nor did he need the incessant prodding of pro-family
special interests to motivate his comments. He knows the relationship
of liberty to virtue because he is a self-motivated student of
truth. 

<P>
History is one of Bob's closest friends. His life-long
relationship with history has honed his bubbling idealism into
a practical and balanced conservative philosophy. As a staunch
proponent of lower taxes and lower federal spending, Bob knows
the bounds of governmental authority, not only because he has
worn this mantle of authority over the last 18 years in Congress
but also because he has studiously examined history. From ancient
Rome to modern America, Bob Dornan knows what makes nations rise
and fall. The presidential rivals who serve with him in Congress
haven't got a clue. 

<P>
Bob Dornan is not the only good conservative
in this race for the presidency. Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes are
also running-and I count each as my friend. Even so, when I have
to choose, it is Bob Dornan I will support. Few other qualities
in a presidential candidate could offset a lack of elected public
service. Bob has been elected to Congress nine times, in Democratic
districts. These experiences have built character that cannot
be found anywhere else in politics.Moreover, Bob's record of service
both in and on behalf of the military is a nearly essential requirement
of the role of commander-in-chief. I know Bob feels it is an absolute
requirement. Through a variety of circumstances, he has witnessed
firsthand how America has influenced the world for good and has
developed the deepest appreciation for U.S. sovereignty. Bob Dornan
would not rush us off to war, nor would he abandon genuine freedom
fighters anywhere in the world. In determining this delicate balance,
I know he would excel-always erring on the cautious side in preserving
American lives and sovereignty. 

<P>
Bob Dornan belies the public persona
crafted and manipulated by an adversarial media elite. His passion
for life, his love of country, his deep commitment to his wife
Sallie and their children and grandchildren, and his uncanny identification
with all types of people sometimes make him an easy target for
mean-spirited and shallow adversaries. Yet he has remained eternally
optimistic about life and about the future of America specifically.
Great men deserve even greater opportunities to show their mettle.
This is why I unhesitatingly support Bob Dornan for president
of the United States of America.

<CENTER><B>Lewis E. Lehrman on Phil Gramm</B></CENTER>
<P>
Who is the authentic heir of the Reagan Revolution, the iron
man who can fulfill its promise? Who among us is the leader with
the compelling vision, the experience, and the perseverance to
lead us out of our time of troubles? I say I know such a man.


<P>
Born a son of the South, a grandson of Yankee immigrants, raised
in Georgia, and grown to manhood in Texas, he has risen to leadership
by virtue of his own remarkable energy and intelligence-just as
he rose to the rank of legislative statesman as the senior senator
from Texas. Phil Gramm is the man. 

<P>
Born poor, self-made, and unencumbered
by the cultural baggage of country-club Republicans, Phil Gramm's
life has demonstrated the promise of the American dream: that
every American, no matter how humble his beginnings, has the right
and the opportunity to rise by indefatigable effort and indisputable
merit as high as he might go. Phil Gramm will rise to the highest
office in the land because he will, conventional wisdom notwithstanding,
roll up the primaries in 1996. And he will win the general election
going away. 

<P>
This is how Phil Gramm will win! He will win with
the most compelling campaign of conservative ideas. He knows what
he believes and loves what he knows. He will win by recruiting
legions of true conservative activists to embrace his definition
of the American dream. He will win by the sheer force of his superior
talent and leadership, which explains why he has built more organization,
raised more money, and won over the vast majority of conservative
activists who know where he stands. 

<P>
Every true conservative who
aspires to the highest office should uphold a clear program of
reform designed to restore our limited constitutional government.
Yet we know, from the failures and disappointments of the past,
that a program by itself is not sufficient. Neither will it be
sufficient in 1996 to choose careerism or time-serving political
credentials. 

<P>
The conservatives now assembled for victory have
learned from hard experience that the man who leads us will only
be sufficient unto the task if he has, in addition to the gift
of intellect and a well-laid plan, something more. That something
is true grit, unimpeachable character, and the irrefragable tenacity
to carry his plan for a rebirth of the American dream to total
triumph. We the people want a president of the United States whose
impeccable conservative ideas and matchless record are joined
with a driving will to win. We want a winner, a big winner, a
man with a strategy for victory.

<P>
In the domain of political economy,
Phil Gramm is the best-trained, best-equipped presidential candidate
in American history. A free-market professor of economics long
before it was trendy, a co-author of the Reagan economic program,
he is the very apostle of low tax rates, a balanced budget, stable
money, and a deregulated economy. Phil Gramm is without peer in
his grasp of how to create full employment, long-term interest
rates of 4 percent, and a tax code based on a flat rate. 

<P>
In the
domain of defense policy, Phil Gramm has prepared himself for
the post-communist world. He has declared that he is &quot;ready
for a world where the lion will lie down with the lamb, and if
such a world comes about, I want the United States of America
to be that lion.&quot; No other policy is acceptable to Phil Gramm,
whose presidential inaugural oath, registered in heaven, will
require him to &quot;preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution
of the United States of America.&quot; 

<P>
Believing as I do that
economics and foreign policy are contingent, but cultural and
social principles are central, what assurance does one have that
President Gramm will encourage and foster the indispensable moral
reformation of the public square? Speaking in May before Liberty
University and The Heritage Foundation, Phil Gramm said: &quot;Faith
and family produced the values and virtues that helped make America
the world's greatest and most powerful nation long before we had
any of the trappings of greatness and power.&quot; Quoting Alexis
de Tocqueville, Gramm said, &quot;'Not until I went into the churches
of America, and heard her pulpits flame with righteousness did
I understand the secret of her genius and power. America is great
because she is good, and if America ever ceased to be good, America
will cease to be great.' I believe that Alexis de Tocqueville
was right 160 years ago, and I believe he is right today.&quot;


<P>
In more specific terms, Gramm has argued that &quot;the social-security
net that we erected has become a hammock. Government programs&#133;have
changed the way we behave, corrupted our values, and diminished
our virtue. As we look more and more towards Caesar to take care
of us, we have turned more and more away from family and faith.
In rendering unto Caesar, we have stopped rendering unto God.&quot;


<P>
And thus we are brought to consider the soul of the Republican
Party as we debate its presidential nomination. During the greatest
crisis of American history, the Republican Party of the United
States was founded on the everlasting covenant of &quot;free soil,
free men, and free labor.&quot; And with the victory of our party
and of President Lincoln came vindication of the inalienable right
to liberty and the end of slavery in America. More than a century
later, the Republican Party of Ronald Reagan came to stand for
many things, but there was one unique covenant in the platforms
of 1980 and 1984. Let us call it the one needful thing. And what
is that thing? Senator Gramm described &quot;the day when all
unborn children are welcomed into life and loved when they get
here.&quot; A Republican Party-indeed, a Republican president-without
a commitment to the inalienable right to life, without unequivocal
opposition to abortion, is as unthinkable as a Republican Party
without Lincoln, the inalienable right to liberty, and unequivocal
opposition to slavery. 

<P>
We conservatives know that, after this
imminent contest for the presidency, our philosophical agenda
entails no less than the comprehensive reformation of our political
institutions. But to pursue a goal without the right man and the
right means to attain it is to court political disaster. Republicans
are blessed with several authentic candidates. But I believe that
Phil Gramm is the only leader with the intellect, the force of
will, and the preparation for greatness who can marshall our forces
for an overwhelming and irreversible victory over our foes.

<CENTER><B>Mary Parker Lewis onAlan Keyes</B></CENTER>
<P>
For the millions of Americans who are brokenhearted over the
decay of moral standards, the disintegration of families and neighborhoods,
and the slaughter of innocents in the womb, Alan Keyes is the
most powerful spokesman on the scene today. More than any other
candidate, Alan Keyes offers a healing message of hope and renewal,
based on the immortal principles of our great Declaration of Independence,
and delivered without apology to the better angels of our nature.


<P>
The former president of Citizens Against Government Waste, Alan
Keyes offers credentials second to none as a champion of Americans
fed up with overtaxation, overspending, and overregulation. For
example, when many Republican leaders were assuring us that Dick
Darman's 1990 budget deal was a winner for George Bush and the
GOP, Alan warned that the agreement would prove disastrous for
taxpayers, the economy, and the party. Events proved him right.


<P>
Today the GOP endorses the policies of tax reduction, spending
restraint, and local empowerment that Alan has championed for
years. That is well and good. But as Alan eloquently reminds Republican
audiences, economics is not at the heart of what ails America.
Serious though they are, our economic problems are largely derivative,
the consequences of having abandoned the moral and constitutional
principles of the American founding. The transfer state is bankrupting
America, but the transfer state comes into its own only when hordes
of people see nothing wrong with living off the toil of others.
In any event, moral vices produce the social problems for which
government programs are inevitably proffered as solutions. 

<P>
That's
why Alan's front-and-center emphasis on moral issues is the only
genuinely practical approach. Consider these words from his February
19 address to the New Hampshire Republican State Committee: &quot;Why
is it that we spend so much money on welfare and illegitimacy?
Why is it that we spend so much money on crime and violence in
our streets? Why is it even that we spend so much money dealing
with the problems of irresponsible behavior that contribute to
the decline of the health of this nation? I think you all know
in your hearts what the real answer is. We don't have money problems,
we have moral problems. And it's time we stood up and faced that
truth.&quot; We will never succeed in relimiting the federal government
until we restore the family to its rightful place as the first
and best &quot;welfare provider&quot; and strengthen the marriage-based,
two-parent family as the fundamental moral unit of society. 

<P>
Of
all the policies eroding the moral foundations of family life
and American freedom, the policy of abortion on demand poses the
greatest danger. There are, of course, many decent people on both
sides of the abortion controversy. Nonetheless, the pro-abortion
position is anti-family. As an institution, the family both depends
upon and nurtures an ethic of duty and self-sacrifice. But the
pro-abortion position fosters an ethic of self-indulgence. It
says, in effect, that the convenience or pleasure of the adult
is the supreme law. 

<P>
Worse, the pro-abortion position implicitly
justifies political despotism. The Declaration of Independence
proclaims the right to life to be a gift from God and, therefore,
inalienable. The pro-abortion argument assumes either that government
(not God) is the source of rights, or that we have the right to
decide whose humanity shall be recognized and whose shall not.
Obviously, the doctrine that there are no natural rights (hence
no natural wrongs) advances the ambitions of those whose chief
interest lies in the expansion of government power. But liberty
is also subverted when we claim the authority to decide who among
us is human, and who is not. Alan put it this way in an April
8 speech to Delaware Republicans: 

<P>
&quot;Don't you realize that
opens the door to every form of tyranny? Because all I have to
do if I want to snuff out your life or trample on your rights
is decide that you're not human. And of course you'll look at
me and say, 'But you can't do that.' And I'll say, 'Well, the
last time the American people decided they were going to draw
the line, my folks ended up on the wrong side of it.' And I don't
think it was because we had the poor judgment to draw the line
in the wrong place. I think it was because we claimed a right
we do not have. We do not have the right to draw that line. God
drew it, and all we have the right to do is respect His will.&quot;


<P>
Slavery and abortion on demand are both what Alan calls &quot;Declaration
issues&quot;-moral wrongs that must be addressed because they
contradict the basic premise of a self-governing polity. I believe
Alan sees so deeply into the nature of the abortion controversy
because he has thought long and hard about slavery and the black
experience in America. 

<P>
Keyes's book, <I>Masters of the Dream:
The Strength and Betrayal of Black America</I>, is not just an
antidote to decades of left-wing revisionism. It is a meditation
on the universal significance of the black experience-the moral
and civic lessons to be learned therefrom. Slavery did not make
blacks slavish, nor did material deprivation turn them into passive
victims. Rather, slavery whetted their natural thirst for freedom,
much as it did to the Hebrews of old. Deprivation taught them
to recognize the true, non-material basis of human dignity. To
survive in the face of adversity, blacks had to become diligent,
dependable, hopeful. They learned to honor hard work, self-discipline,
family, and the riches of the spirit. Such qualities of moral
and spiritual strength are the key to restoring the true American
dream-the dream of freedom. 

<P>
Beginning in the 1960s, black America
was betrayed by the same forces that are destroying the dream
for all Americans: the perverse incentives of the transfer state,
and the debilitating doctrines of sexual permissiveness and moral
relativism. Alan Keyes's candidacy is a candidacy like no other.
Drawing on the moral lessons of black history, the imperishable
truths of the Declaration, and the arts of statesmanship, Alan
Keyes will elevate the 1996 presidential contest to a plane not
seen in America since the Lincoln-Douglas debates.

<CENTER><B>MitchellE. Daniels Jr. on Richard Lugar</B></CENTER>
<P>
 As they search for the best national leader in 1996, conservatives
should look beyond words, votes, and even public actions. The
true measure of authenticity must encompass not only what a man
has shown to the camera, but also what he has shown to his family,
his neighbors, and his Maker. For Dick Lugar, conservatism is
not merely a school of thought, it is a way of life, and it is
in that context that he emerges as the right man to lead America
back to strength and virtue. 

<P>
By every conventional yardstick,
Dick Lugar has been a rock of conservative principle and consistency.
As the mayor of Indianapolis, he cut taxes five times in eight
years, and battled tirelessly against federal intrusion into state
and local autonomy. As a senator, he has amassed a voting record
in the most conservative fifth of each Congress in which he has
served; statistically, he was Ronald Reagan's number-one supporter
for the eight years of the 40th presidency. 

<P>
Lugar's campaign for
the presidency is animated by these same bedrock beliefs. His
determination to shrink government and reduce spending is confirmed
by his ongoing, often lonely battle to cut agricultural subsidies
and free American farmers to plant for the market, not the government.
Like Churchill, he believes that &quot;The responsibility of Ministers
for the public safety is absolute and requires no mandate. It
is in fact the prime object for which governments come into existence.&quot;
He knows, and is unafraid to state, that the safety of our country
cannot be left to chance, but will demand American activism on
nuclear proliferation, ballistic-missile defense, and terrorism.


<P>
Dick Lugar rejects the current establishment's constrained vision
of a U.S. economy growing at only 2 or 3 percent per year. His
clarion call to abolish all taxation of enterprise is the single
most radical and promising idea on the 1996 agenda. Alone among
the candidates' reform proposals, it would uproot today's entire
anti-growth, anti-savings regime of income, capital-gains, and
estate taxation, and turn loose a 1980s-like explosion of investment,
exports, jobs, and higher incomes. 

<P>
But for all its macroeconomic
appeal, the true significance of the Lugar tax plan lies in its
underlying values. Leapfrogging the flat tax and its imitators,
Lugar would abolish at a stroke the most dehumanizing aspects
of modern statism: the invasions of privacy, the abuses of power,
the insidious invisibility of withholding, and the unspoken assumption
that income belongs to the state rather than the individual. Through
their consumption decisions, individuals would have full control
of the rate of their taxation. In a real sense, Dick Lugar's tax
plan is the ultimate expression of conservative philosophy. 

<P>Anyone
can write a platform. Many have compiled positive records of words,
votes, and public deeds. It is the rarest of public men who can
also lead a life in complete congruence with the principles he
espouses. 

<P>
Dick Lugar has lived the virtues of self-discipline,
duty, devotion to country, and religious faith that we all admire
but practice imperfectly. He was first in his class in high school,
first in his class at college; he has been a Methodist lay minister,
and an Eagle Scout. Like Bill Clinton, Dick Lugar visited the
American Embassy in London while he was a Rhodes Scholar; unlike
Clinton, Lugar went there to enlist in the U.S. Navy. 

<P>
Lugar served
his country with distinction, including a stint as intelligence
briefer to Admiral Arleigh Burke, the chief of naval operations.
Returning to his home town, he saved a struggling family manufacturing
business, carried on the family farming operations, and with Charlene,
his wife (and co-president of their college's student body), built
his own little platoon of four sons. As a school-board member,
he fought for racial integration and against forced busing. That
brought him to the public's attention, and eventually to an elective
career. But throughout his public life, he has remained closely
involved in both his businesses. Dick Lugar has always been a
citizen legislator. 

<P>
When President Lugar calls Americans to reassert
the moral superiority of hard work, personal responsibility, intact
families, and respect for life, his conviction will not be drawn
merely from congressional testimony of the latest policy analysis.
His leadership of a cultural recovery in our country will be grounded
in a life of commitment to virtues early learned and deep embedded.


<P>
The conservative revolution is yet to be won. Building upon the
congressional breakthrough of 1994 will require the election of
a Republican president, and not just any Republican will do. Total
triumph will only be won by a president who can attract and hold
the respect and affection of millions of citizens. 

<P>
Dick Lugar's
brand of inclusive, reasoned, friendly conservatism has allowed
him to build larger coalitions and shatter electoral records throughout
his career. Just as he is the candidate most certain to disarm
President Clinton in a general election, he is the man best equipped
to win the enduring trust of the larger majorities whose support
will consummate the conservative crusade.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Roger J. Stone
Jr. on Arlen Specter</B></CENTER>
<P>
Arlen Specter is a Jew, he comes from a big city, he has a record
of commitment to racial equality (without quotas), he's pro-choice,
and he believes strongly in tolerance and the First Amendment
doctrine of church-state separation. For social-issue conservatives
who take their marching orders from Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed,
who believe in Pat Buchanan's &quot;holy war&quot; for the soul
of America, some or all of these factors probably make Specter's
candidacy anathema. Frankly, this article is not addressed to
them. 

<P>
The conservatives to whom this article is addressed are
conservatives like myself-the kind of conservatives I met in 1964
as a member of Young Americans for Freedom, fighting the good
fight for Barry Goldwater; the conservatives I led as National
Chairman of Young Republicans, and worked with beginning in 1976,
and then in 1980 and 1984, to give America eight magnificent years
of a Ronald Reagan presidency; and the supply-side conservatives
I worked with in Jack Kemp's 1988 presidential campaign in an
effort to continue that tradition. 

<P>
This article is addressed to
conservatives who, like Barry Goldwater, believe that government
ought to get off our backs, keep out of our pocketbooks, and stay
out of our bedrooms. This article is addressed to conservatives
who, like Ronald Reagan, believe in a strong America: strong enough
militarily to secure our interests and keep the peace around the
world, strong enough domestically to win the war against drugs
and violent crime on our streets. This article is addressed to
conservatives who, like Jack Kemp, believe in an American future
of unlimited economic opportunity and unprecedented growth fueled
by low taxes, free trade, and free markets. 

<P>
To those libertarian
conservatives, who I believe are the true core of American conservatism,
I say Arlen Specter is your candidate. In Arlen Specter, you will
find a senator with a strong record of conservatism that goes
back to his first days in the senate. In the Specter '96 campaign,
you will find a program thoroughly grounded in conservative ideals
and ideas, and a candidate committed to fiscal and economic conservatism
who has the best chance of beating Bill Clinton in a general election.


<P>
First, the Specter record. Arlen Specter came to the Senate in
1981 with an outstanding background in law enforcement as Philadelphia's
district attorney, where he fought successfully to end plea bargaining
and win stiff sentences for violent criminals. In the Senate,
he immediately made tough anticrime policies a legislative priority,
and authored the 1984 Armed Career Criminal bill, the first federal
law to use &quot;three strikes&quot; to get long-term jail terms
for repeat offenders. A strong believer in the deterrent force
of the death penalty, Arlen Specter has for 15 years been the
driving force in Congress to put teeth back into state death-penalty
laws by eliminating ridiculous judicial delays in carrying out
death sentences. 

<P>
Throughout the Reagan presidency, Arlen Specter
was a solid supporter of the revitalization of the American military,
including the Strategic Defense Initiative. He firmly opposed
any effort to relax the Cuban embargo. He has been at the forefront
of the fight to combat terrorism at home and abroad, and was a
leading Senate voice in support of the Gulf War resolution. Recently,
he has been a vocal Senate force in opposition to the Clinton
administration's appeasement of North Korea and its pointless
risk of U.S. lives in Haiti. 

<P>
Specter's fiscal record in the Senate
is solidly conservative: long-time support for both a balanced
budget amendment and the line-item veto (including sponsoring
his own legislation during his second term); support for the Reagan
era tax cuts; and, early this year,his own flat-tax bill-the Senate's
only such legislation.

<P>
For the same reasons that Specter has opposed
government interference into Americans' private lives, he has
always opposed gun-control and supported the rights of law-abiding
citizens to own firearms. He believes that swift, certain, and
severe punishment of criminals, not confiscation of guns from
the public, is the effective way to fight violent crime.

<P>
The defining
themes of the Specter '96 campaign are squarely conservative.
As Arlen Specter said in announcing his candidacy last March:
    
<P>
&quot;With the election of a Republican Congress in 1994 and
a Republican president in 1996, we have a unique opportunity to
move America toward unprecedented prosperity and unlimited opportunity....


<P>
&quot;We do so by implementing our core Republican values: smaller
government; less spending; lower taxes; civil rights and liberties;
strong national defense; and effective crime control.&#133; I
stand before you today as a man willing to work with every ounce
of my energy and every fiber of my determination to renew once
again the dreams of freedom and opportunity that for 200 years
have made this nation the envy of and the example for the world.&quot;


<P>
In his announcement speech, Specter made just two specific pledges
on domestic policy, and both reflect the fundamentally conservative
orientation of his governing philosophy: to balance the budget
by 2002 (and to write the first check to reduce the national debt
in January, 2003); and to deliver a flat-tax bill to the Congress
at his own inauguration. 

<P>
The flat-tax concept-a single 20 percent
tax rate on all business and personal income, elimination of all
loopholes and deductions except for a portion of home-mortgage
interest and small charitable contributions, and no taxation on
interest, dividends, and capital gains-has become the economic
centerpiece of the Specter campaign. As welcome as specific tax
cuts might be, they are mere Band-Aids for a tax system that is
long on bureaucrats, rules, and regulations and short on incentives
for economic growth. The future of conservative fiscal policy
lies with the flat tax-House Majority Leader Dick Armey said the
next president would be elected on a flat-tax platform-and Arlen
Specter is the only Republican candidate to commit foursquare
to such a system. 

<P>
Conservatives need to be realists. We need to
recognize that Bill Clinton is not as vulnerable as he once seemed
or as we might like. The 1996 Republican nominee will face in
Bill Clinton an energetic campaigner, a president determined to
use the considerable powers of incumbency in support of his re&euml;lection,
and a man zealously supported by interest groups determined to
retain their last link to political power. As conservatives, we
need a Republican nominee who can defeat Bill Clinton in a general
election-and that means Arlen Specter. 

<P>
Since 1980, Arlen Specter
has won three tough Senate races (and two tough primaries) in
a bellwether state where Democrats have always far outnumbered
Republicans. In 1992, despite the fury of radical feminists over
his defense of Clarence Thomas, Specter carried Pennsylvania by
three points while George Bush was losing the state to Clinton
by a million votes. Arlen Specter has a reputation as an indefatigable
campaigner-a reputation I can tell you is well deserved. He has
the intellect, tenacity, and toughness to take on Bill Clinton
in a presidential debate-and to win going away. 

<P>
In Arlen Specter,
conservatives have the chance to support a candidate committed
to a balanced budget and a flat tax at home, and to the restoration
of American strength, resolve, and credibility abroad; a candidate
who has the knowledge and experience to lead a national war on
crime and drugs; and a candidate who can win the White House on
these issues. Conservatives who see themselves as heir to the
libertarian legacy of Barry Goldwater, the Reagan tradition of
American strength abroad and limited government at home, and the
Kemp commitment to broad-based growth and prosperity belong in
his camp.

<P>
Today the commonsense conservative philosophy that so many have
fought for, for so long, holds sway in the Supreme Court, in the
U.S. Senate, and in the House of Representatives. There is only
one piece missing in the conservative political jigsaw puzzle-the
White House. When that piece is in place, a picture of real political
revolution will emerge, a revolution that could roll on well into
the next century.

<P>
That is why the stakes next year are so high.

<P>
There
have been three successful conservative Republican presidents
elected in our lifetimes-Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon,
and Ronald Reagan. I've worked to help elect and then serve with
two of them, and I believe there are certain requirements that
a person must have to win the Republican nomination and then the
presidency.   

<P>Here's the short list:
<UL>
<LI>They must have rock-solid
conservative views on national security and economic policy, and
they must be in accord on a wide range of social issues important
to the conservative base of the Republican party.
<LI>They must
be political warhorses, with a powerful political base-preferably
California (54 electoral votes), New York (33 votes), or Texas
(32 votes)-and skilled campaigners. Executive experience in government
is a big plus.
<LI>They must have high intelligence, great stamina,
and a record free of scandal. Running for president against any
incumbent Democrat, in the teeth of a hostile, liberal press,
is a mind-numbing, exhausting gauntlet. 
</UL>

<P>
The Republican candidates
running for president in 1996 are a distinguished group; any one
of them would be a dramatic improvement over President Clinton.
By the fall of 1995, it is likely that the race will narrow to
three men: Senator Dole, Senator Gramm, and Governor Wilson. They
are all good men, but I believe that one of them-Pete Wilson-best
meets the criteria for getting nominated, getting elected, and
governing successfully. 

<P>
<B>Peace and National Security.</B> Pete Wilson
has a strong, consistent record of conservative positions on national
defense and foreign policy. Known as a national defense hawk in
the U.S. Senate, he was a leading supporter of President Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and one of the few who called
for early deployment. An expert on strategic nuclear policy and
arms control he was a critic of the SALT II treaty and backed
President Reagan's INF treaty.  

<P>
As governor, he has been an outspoken
critic of President Clinton for squandering U.S. prestige and
influence around the world and cutting national defense spending
to dangerously low levels. 

<P>
In the 1950s, he was a platoon leader
in the U.S. Marines. On national-defense matters, they don't come
any tougher than former U.S. Marine officers. On national security,
Pete Wilson is as tough a defender of U.S. interests as any Republican
running. 

<P>
<B>Prosperity and Economic Policy.</B> As a U.S. Senator, he
consistently supported both a constitutional amendment to balance
the federal budget, and line-item veto authority for the president.
As a candidate for the Senate, he strongly opposed the 1982 tax
increase; and as senator, he voted against President Bush's 1990
tax increase. 

<P>
When he became the governor of California in 1991,
he inherited the worst economic mess in the state's history. The
deficit facing him was one third of the state's general fund request,
comparable to a $500 billion deficit in today's federal budget,
but with one big difference-the California constitution mandates
a balanced budget. Unlike Washington, where you can take seven
years to achieve fiscal responsibility, he only had one year and
a legislature controlled by Democrats. Although some taxes were
raised, the lion's share of that deficit was eliminated by tough
spending control. 

<P>
In fact, during the four years of his first
term he held spending flat in current dollars. If you account
for inflation, real spending went down-not from some bogus baseline
projection, but from actual 1991 spending levels. If the federal
government had exercised comparable toughness, the federal budget
would be in balance today. 

<P>
California also went through a few
other trials-drastic defense-industry cutbacks, the collapse of
real-estate values, fires, floods, mudslides, riots, and earthquakes.
But Pete Wilson's tough spending control, unmatched in any other
state, laid the foundation for a strong economic recovery that
confounded the experts-a recovery strong enough to generate sufficient
new tax revenues to pay off temporary debts, to fund spending
increases for education and law enforcement, and to propose a
15 percent across-the-board tax cut for all individuals and businesses.
If the Democratic-controlled legislature refuses to pass the tax
cut, Pete Wilson has vowed to hold a statewide ballot referendum
and let the voters decide. When passed, the new tax rates will
be below what they were when he took office. 

<P>
Pete Wilson is the
only Republican candidate proposing a true supply-side tax cut-not
increased deductions or exemptions, but an across-the-board reduction
in tax rates. 

<P>Speaking to the Republican Midwest Leadership Conference
on May 19, 1995, he spelled out the Reagan supply-side formula
for economic prosperity: &quot;If we both cut taxes and cut spending...there
is every reason for not just optimism but for justified confidence
in America's dynamic growth.&quot; 

<P>
<B>Justice and Social Issues.</B>
Here his record is overwhelmingly on the side of conservative
values, a clear sense of what is right and wrong, and of achieving
justice. Pete Wilson, the governor of our largest state, took
the lead not only in reforming welfare, but also in actually cutting
the amount of benefits paid. He was the first political leader
to sound the alarm on the injustice of paying billions of taxpayers'
dollars for the welfare, medical care, and education expenses
of illegal aliens. He led the battle for &quot;three strikes and
you're out&quot; for career criminals, locking them up for life
after their third felony conviction. 

<P>
A supporter of term limits
for politicians and the kind of federalism the Founding Fathers
intended for the United States, he has led the fight against the
heavy hand of federal mandates, declaring that California is &quot;not
a colony of the federal government.&quot; 

<P>
He has fought for regulatory
and legal reform, proposed a state constitutional amendment to
limit regulatory excesses, and issued an executive order suspending
the environmental regulations that contributed to the recent flood
damage. He has consistently vetoed legislation that would extend
special rights to gays, while opposing measures that would discriminate
against them. Pete Wilson, an expert pistol shot when he served
in the Marine Corps, has always supported the fundamental Second
Amendment rights of Americans to keep and bear arms, subject only
to some commonsense restrictions that support law enforcement.
On affirmative action, he has called for commonsense justice-a
color-blind society in which people would be treated equally regardless
of race or gender. 

<P>
On the social issue that most troubles the
Republican party today-abortion-Pete Wilson holds strong, consistent
views. While fully aware of the deeply held beliefs of those who
oppose all abortion and the reasoning behind those beliefs, he
has also carefully considered the rights and responsibilities
of the individuals involved, and the dangers of allowing an already
too powerful federal government to intrude itself into the most
intimate, difficult decision a woman can make. He strongly believes
we should encourage the kind of responsibility that would make
abortion unnecessary, that the question of abortion is best left
to the family and church, and that we should try to remove this
issue from the political arena to the extent possible. 

<P>
Is this
conservative? Well, it is the position shared by a substantial
majority of the Republican Party. Considering the terrible moral
dilemmas involved, it is a commonsense conservative view. 

<P>
<B>Electability.</B>
Most of my conservative friends are primarily interested in ideas
and principles, but for those who are also concerned with mundane
things like winning elections and taking power, I have a final
thought. 

<P>
If Pete Wilson wins the Republican nomination in 1996,
he will win the 54 electoral votes of California in the general
election. No Democratic nominee can be elected president without
winning California. 

<P>
Therefore, the nomination of Pete Wilson is
as close to a guarantee as you can get that Republicans   will-for
the first time in 44 years-control both houses of the Congress
and the White House. 

<P>If that happens, well then, as Ronald Reagan
once said: &quot;You ain't seen nothin' yet.&quot;

<p>
Big Government was consolidated in America in the First Hundred Days of the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. By promising that the House would enact the Contract With America in the First Hundred Days of the 104th Congress, Speaker Newt Gingrich deliberately invited the history books to compare the work of the House Republican leadership with the New Deal of FDR.<p>
Policy Review asked nine students of American politics to assess the historic significance of Gingrich's First Hundred Days, and the principal achievements and errors of the House Republican leadership during this "rendezvous with destiny."<p>
<center><b>John J. Pitney, Jr.</center></b><p>
At first glance, it seems that the House GOP's First Hundred Days compare badly with FDR's. Although all the items in the Contract With America reached the House floor, only two of them (congressional compliance and unfunded mandates) became law before the hundredth day. By contrast, FDR signed bushels of bills during the Hundred Days of 1933. His emergency banking measure went through introduction, passage, and signature on the very first day of the congressional session—and in less than eight hours.<p>
It is unfair, however, to judge today's House Republicans by the Roosevelt standard. Crisis is the great lubricant of the legislative process, and the economic calamities of FDR's early days briefly suspended Capitol Hill's normal friction. And odd as it may sound, many aspects of public life actually moved faster in 1933 than in 1995. Take justice, for instance. Shortly before FDR took office, a man named Giuseppe Zangara fired five shots at the president-elect, missing him but killing one person and wounding four others. Zangara was tried, convicted, and executed within 33 days. In the 1990s, jury selection alone can take longer than that, and capital offenders can stay out of the electric chair for years by filing endless habeas corpus petitions.<p>
Government has become tangled in its own red tape—which is precisely why the Republicans put so much emphasis on procedural reform. They started with the House itself, recognizing that the institution would work more efficiently with fewer committees and smaller staffs. The best symbol of their commitment to renewing Congress came with the congressional-compliance bill, which cleared both chambers faster than any peacetime domestic legislation since Roosevelt's banking bill in 1933. In other ways, the Republicans strove to make government leaner and less cumbersome. Proposals such as block grants would eliminate layers of bureaucracy and miles of red tape. And the GOP crime bill would restore rationality to the appeals process in capital cases, thereby ensuring swift justice for the Zangaras of the future.<p>House Republicans are pushing the federal government to match the pace of 62 years ago. Ironically, that is high praise.<p>

<p>
The First Hundred Days of the new House Republican leaders will deserve that well-worn adjective "historic" even if relatively few of the measures listed in their Contract With America ever become law in a form they would recognize. For the central achievement of the First Hundred Days was to change the whole terrain and direction of American politics.<p>
Last year, the most that could be conceived, let alone hoped for, in the field of tax reform was a modest reduction in the rate of income taxation. Today—whether or not major changes occur in the first session of the 104th Congress—the serious talk among congressional leaders is about imposing a flat tax, or even tearing up the tax code by the roots and replacing the income tax with a broad-based tax on consumption.<p>
Similarly, "welfare reform" in 1994 meant, at best, doing a little nipping and tucking on Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Today, the entire burden of administering most of the nation's huge welfare programs is on its way back to the 50 individual states, along with block grants to finance it.<p>
And so it went, in one field after another, from unfunded mandates to the line-item veto; this new House of Representatives has dared to think and act in ways that have simply transformed the paradigms of American politics. It remains true that "politics is the art of the possible," but a huge number of new possibilities has opened up.<p>
Whether the First Hundred Days of this House will ultimately deserve comparison to the First Hundred Days of Franklin Roosevelt's presidency depends upon how successful the Republicans are in setting their initiatives in concrete, as the New Dealers managed to set theirs. At this writing, and probably for several years to come, it is simply too early to tell. Much depends on how the voters react in November 1996, when they will, with their votes, make their first and perhaps most important comment on the Republican performance. Almost as crucial, however, will be the way in which future Republican presidents and Congresses follow up on the achievements of the 104th.<p>
Any major mistakes? Yes, one: The failure to anticipate and prepare for the Democrats' counterattack, based on the tired old charge that Republicans want to starve America's children and stuff the money into the pockets of the rich. Don't be fooled by the sheer implausibility of such an accusation—a big enough lie will be believed, by a small but often crucial percentage of the voters, if it isn't nailed promptly and repeatedly by spokesmen whom the media cannot ignore. (Note how disastrously the Bush administration let the liberals rewrite the whole history of the 1980s.) We may yet pay dearly for the Republican party's sloth in this regard.<p>

<p>
The House Republican Leadership did most of what it said it would do in the Contract With America. The result was a remarkable legislative flurry that largely fulfilled the campaign promises that so many Republicans made during the 1994 elections.<p>
How do we compare this Republican onslaught in 1995 with FDR's First Hundred Days in 1933? Both were years of high legislative intensity; both years are likely to be described later as landmarks in 20th-century political history. And, in both years, the discussion of ideas dominated the media.<p>
The differences between the two events are more interesting, and in some cases more subtle. Obviously, the Republicans were critical of Big Government and skeptical of the idea that man can improve his condition through central planning. The Republicans had zeal, but no faith in the perfectibility of man. By contrast, FDR's New Deal promoted the idea that government could solve economic problems—that individual liberty had to be sacrificed and power centralized in Washington to attack the Great Depression. FDR's spirits were high because he believed man to be capable of pulling the levers and turning the wheels to effectively control America's destiny.<p>
Another difference is often overlooked. The Republican Contract was a conscious, thoughtful, and usually coherent plan that went from campaign document to legislative writ. The New Deal was improvisational and contradictory right from the start. During the 1932 campaign, for example, FDR denounced Hoover for his "reckless spending" and budget deficits. The New Deal to come was never outlined. But in Roosevelt's First Hundred Days, he reversed himself. In just three months, he pushed and signed bills that authorized government to spend almost as much as Hoover did in his entire presidency. FDR wanted a government program for each constituency: AAA for farmers, FERA for the unemployed, TVA for the South, CCC for the young, and so on.<p>
His First Hundred Days were crucial because they shattered the notion that government worked best when it was limited. Government became a Mecca for interest groups that wanted to secure benefits from Washington, so much so that FDR, after his First Hundred Days, could not control the claimants. Cities flooded Congress with requests for road-building money; veterans won cash bonuses for past service; the silver lobby wangled from Washington more subsidy money than even the farmers could manage. American politics had crossed a threshold.<p>
The Republican Contract is a response to the rise of this welfare state and to the twofold protest that the New Deal/Great Society programs mostly haven't worked, and taxes to pay for them are too high. These two points are addressed in part by the Balanced Budget Amendment. If it had included Congressman Dick Armey's flat-tax proposal—instead of seeking to manipulate the current system of tax deductions—the Contract could have challenged the New Deal more effectively. Special-interest politics, as Roosevelt learned, needs to extract money from some groups in order to support others. A progressive income tax is indispensable to a growing welfare state. In office, FDR soon hiked the top marginal tax rate to 79 percent; later he pushed it to 90 percent. A flat tax, by contrast, forces supporters of new government programs (and old ones, for that matter) to admit they will tax all to benefit a few. That admission alone might lead many to rethink the strong role of government in American society.<p>

Of course it wasn't the same as those Hundred Days. In March 1933, when FDR got Congress to enact a slew of government-aggrandizing laws—thus triggering the New Deal that vastly expanded Washington's control—17 million citizens had lost their jobs, 5,000 banks had collapsed, and the nation was mired in the most frightening depression in its history. Amid mass desperation, a Democratic president with a fresh mandate was able to get a Democratic Congress to more or less pass anything he wanted.<p>
The national mood in January 1995, by contrast, was nowhere near as frantic. When Speaker Gingrich and the House Republicans uncorked their political revolution, they benefited from none of the panic-driven momentum that the Depression had lent Franklin Roosevelt and the Democrats 62 years earlier. Instead, they faced an enemy in the White House, a largely hostile press corps, a $1.6 trillion federal establishment more likely to munch ground glass than relinquish power without a death-struggle, and a Senate led by Bob Dole.So, no, in terms of legislation completed, Gingrich's First Hundred Days don't compare with FDR's. But measured against other yardsticks, the House Republicans' quick-march through the Contract With America was even more significant.<p>
The customary formula of federal politics is: The president proposes, Congress disposes. So thoroughly did Gingrich and his army upend that piece of conventional wisdom that by the end of a hundred days, Bill Clinton was reduced to insisting that he still mattered. "The president," he sniffled in a mid-April press conference, "is relevant here."<p>
The Republicans upended another piece of conventional wisdom: that platforms—i.e., ideas—don't win or lose elections. The life cycles of modern party platforms are familiar. Party members meet. They brawl over a couple of planks. They vote for a platform everyone can live with. Then they print a few copies nobody will ever read or care about.<p>
In 1994, GOP House candidates followed a completely different path. They gathered to sign a brief "contract" whose details weren't yet drafted, but whose main promise—drastically reduced federal power—was crystal-clear. The pundits promptly consigned it to oblivion. Tens of millions of copies appeared in print. And an intense ideological campaign was then waged between the party that wrote the Contract and the party that reviled it.<p>
Never in modern U.S. politics has a party platform—a party's statement of principles—mattered more. Two years ago, they lost a White House they had virtually owned because their incumbent didn't grasp the power of "the vision thing"; in November, Republicans conquered a Congress thought to be permanently closed to them precisely because they did.<p>
Or did they?<p>
Right after the GOP won its astonishing victory, Gingrich articulated his Prime Directive: "Cooperate, yes. Compromise, no." Right after that, the compromising began.<p>
The provision for a three-fifths supermajority to approve tax increases was dropped from the Balanced Budget Amendment. The national-security bill was stripped of missile defense. The unfunded-mandates bill repealed precisely zero unfunded federal mandates. The GOP's crime bill wound up with the same price tag as the supposedly "pork-filled" Democratic version of last year. The bloated food-stamp program was exempted from welfare reform. Term limits were croaked.<p>
The Clinton tax increases that Republicans had unanimously opposed in 1993 were left virtually intact. Republicans talked of "zeroing out" government subsidies for the arts and public broadcasting—until Garth Brooks came by to lobby, and the talk dried up. The House passed a legal-reform bill that federalized great swaths of tort law. Enthusiasm for eliminating entire Cabinet departments was limited to feisty freshmen with no clout and conservative think tanks with no vote. And to mark the completion of the First Hundred Days, Gingrich declared in a television address that his party was certainly not proposing to actually shrink the federal budget.<p>
In its First Hundred Days, the new GOP House majority ignited the conservative revolution it had been elected to achieve. Without question, it has changed the terms of debate on the Hill. But before their sprint through the Contract was done, the Republicans were once again showing the symptoms that had always doomed them in the past: weak knees and thin skin.<p>

<p>
Speaker Gingrich and his lieutenants fulfilled to the letter the Contract with America pledge that ten important issues would be taken to a vote in the House. Observers must be impressed, moreover, by the GOP's passage of nine of these, and by the party's ability to round up four-fifths of its members for the failed term-limits constitutional amendment. The new House leadership has established a remarkable working model of a disciplined, responsible party motivated by deeply-felt principles—on one side of Capitol Hill.<p>
And when one looks for long-term significance, there's the rub. As of this writing, the Balanced Budget Amendment has already failed in the Senate, which is widely expected to reject or drastically modify other Contract items. In addition, President Clinton may muster the courage, conviction, or pragmatic judgment to wield a veto or two. What comes out of the Senate and White House legislative sausage-grinders will likely strike Contract devotees as inferior bratwurst rather than fine tenderloin. No, this will not be as significant as FDR's First Hundred Days.<p>
What major mistakes did the Republicans make? Clearly they still need to work on what George Bush might have called "the message thing." Admittedly, it is no easy task to get a conservative perspective past the filter of a predominantly liberal-leaning national media, but it can be done. The leadership was blindsided on the school-lunch issue, although the Democratic tactics were predictable. Thanks to Henry Hyde's impassioned defense of political careerism, network television played the term-limits debate as primarily an argument among Republicans rather than one between Republicans and Democrats. In the absence of a Jack Kemp able to explain in appealing terms the importance of preferences for capital gains and savings, the Democrats appear to have achieved an advantage on the tax-equity issue. Finally, the Speaker, for all his intramural leadership skills, oscillates wildly between flashes of brilliance and egregious gaffes. As a result, he enjoys less public esteem than he deserves.<p>
At the end of the hundred days, the Republicans remain locked in a continuing struggle with the Democrats for the soul of an angry, alienated "populistic" segment of the electorate—similar to the swing constituency once called "Middle America" and these days attracted to Ross Perot. The GOP can prevail when it convincingly depicts the Democrats as the party of the special interests (affirmative-action beneficiaries, welfare bureaucrats, etc.), but the issue can be used by the Democrats when they depict the Republicans as advocates of tax breaks for "the rich" or abusers of mothers and children. The argument remains unsettled; the Republicans need to do a much better job of articulating their side of it.<p>
Corrosively cynical, this populistic electorate seems to see only business as usual in Washington and is unlikely to give the Republicans much credit for an imperfectly fulfilled Contract. It also still appears prone to believe the budget can be balanced simply by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse while leaving entitlements and pork untouched. It remains uncertain whether this group, or America at large, is prepared for the consequences of a smaller federal establishment: greater local and individual self-reliance.<p>
One last thought: If conservatives want to be successful, they had better stop depicting themselves as involved in a sweeping effort to uproot the New Deal. Speaker Gingrich (perhaps consciously drawing on the example of Ronald Reagan) was right on target in professing admiration for Franklin D. Roosevelt and at least some of his accomplishments. The Republicans were elected to reverse the lingering excesses of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, not to take us back to the world of Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover.<p><I>

There are advantages as well as disadvantages to speed.<p>
The First Hundred Days of the Republican majority were like a laser show—full of color and sound, but so fast and furious that it was difficult for voters to single out the constituent parts.<p>
The Contract gave shape to the first months of Republican dominance on Capitol Hill, which might otherwise have been characterized by fits and starts. Though designed primarily as a vote-getter, the Contract also served extremely well to enforce party discipline. Everyone understood the promise, everyone was committed to the schedule, and factiousness among Republicans was kept to a minimum.<p>
That was the advantage of speed. The disadvantage is that the individual terms of the Contract, many of which deserved a greater hearing, more explanation, and more time before the public, were given short shrift. Few Americans really understand the benefits of tort reform, welfare reform, or regulatory reform.<p>
In a bravura performance over the First Hundred Days, the Republicans made only two errors. The first was the excessive attention to the question of whether or not to punish Senator Mark Hatfield for his vote on the Balanced Budget Amendment. In so doing, Republicans themselves (without help from the media) made Hatfield and, accordingly, internecine Republican quarrels, the story of the BBA's failure. In fact, the story ought to have been the six Democrats who switched their votes and defeated a bill they had supported only months before. Hatfield is a liberal Republican. He voted his conscience. Punishment would have been futile. Besides, his breed is dying out. He does not represent the future of the GOP. Effort spent trying to "fix" him would be better directed elsewhere.<p>
The other error was the failure to anticipate the reaction among liberals (especially in the press) to changes in the school-lunch program. Of course the liberals were dishonest, unscrupulous, and brazen in their depiction of the terms of debate ("starving children" indeed!), but it is the job of conservatives in America to prepare for that pitch and knock it out of the park. Ronald Reagan knew that Jimmy Carter was going to portray him as a mad bomber in the 1980 presidential debates, and he was ready with a riposte: "There you go again." But Republicans were caught flat-footed when Democrats accused them of trying to take food from the mouths of babes.<p>
Still, only two mistakes in three months is an enviable record. I wish I could match it.<p><I>

While the fulfillment of the House Republicans' Contract With America in just 92 days is largely worth rejoicing, this momentous occasion also illustrates how Americans have "defined democracy down" through the years. The House's single-minded passage of the Contract's provisions (with the unfortunate and sloppily-handled exception of term limits) was an exhilarating interval in recent political history. Still, the balloons and streamers flew over the U.S. Capitol after the Contract's completion precisely because the House GOP accomplished what Americans should normally expect of their representatives: They engaged them with ideas. They pledged to vote on them, then did so, as promised.<p>
Although this sort of innovation and accountability should be routine, they instead are refreshing departures from the recent national campaigns that have enflamed public cynicism. George Bush's abandoned "Read my lips: no new taxes" pledge and Bill Clinton's phantom "middle-class tax cut" illustrate this problem. The Contract's greatest legacy may be that it reversed the rising tide of antagonism that had severely eroded Washington's goodwill with the American public. Now that House Republicans have actually kept their word on the Contract, Congress today enjoys its highest approval rating in years.<p>
Assuming the Senate and President Clinton cooperate, the enactment of most Contract items, per se, will not influence American politics as profoundly as did FDR in his First Hundred Days. However, the paradigm shift that has accompanied the Contract likely will parallel the new thinking that FDR inspired 62 years ago. The Contract and the GOP's takeover of Congress have led Washington to discuss seriously the abolition of the income tax, the closing of at least four Cabinet departments, and a balanced budget by 2002. House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt has now embraced tax simplification, while Bill Clinton has placed federal affirmative-action policies under a microscope. These realities would have been mere hallucinations just nine months ago. By committing themselves to a coherent "vision thing," today's GOP has moved the entire plate of acceptable discourse tectonically to the right.<p>
Speaker Newt Gingrich and his allies, however, stumbled badly on the so-called "school-lunch" issue. Democrats stereotypically pummel GOP budget cuts and block grants with dusty rhetoric about "starving babies" and "at-risk infants." Republicans should have anticipated these attacks after seeing them haunt Ronald Reagan and George Bush for 12 years. Opening with a salvo against corporate welfare—such as having Archer-Daniels-Midland tycoon Dwayne Andreas explain to a subcommittee why his multi-billion-dollar agroempire deserves federal subsidies—would have blunted Democratic charges about GOP "greed" and "meanness." So would have energetic reminders that vibrant economic growth especially lifts the poor and unemployed.<p>
The Contract also failed to address the coming entitlements meltdown. While Speaker Gingrich insists it is "off the table," Social Security, as well as Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits and other give-away programs, jeopardize America's future financial well-being. While a promise to vote on affluence-testing or privatization of these programs would have made the Contract far more controversial, it also would have shown the GOP exhibiting genuine courage. Now, without a mandate to do so, the Republican-led 104th Congress must show even greater bravery by confronting entitlements (try balancing the budget without doing so). Or, it simply can stand back and watch Social Security and Medicare eat us alive. <p>

Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and the new Republican House leadership deserve thanks and congratulations for the successful completion of the Contract With America. What a revolutionary (or more correctly, counterrevolutionary) series of events has taken place! With the Contract, a promise to the American people was made; in a little less than the promised hundred days, the promise was kept. Of what other Congress in this century can that be said?<p>
Certainly some needed changes were made to vexing and intolerable House rules; for the first time, national laws passed by Congress will apply to the House as well as ordinary Americans. Having to live by the rules made for the rest of us cannot but raise the consciousness of the rulemakers and dissuade them from their excesses.<p>
Certainly some important legislation was passed by the House in those historic hundred days. Congress agreed to stop imposing mandates on state and local jurisdictions without paying the bill; such progress was nearly undreamt of in our philosophy just a few months before the Contract was unveiled. Is this important? Indeed it is. Is it enough? Perhaps not. Our liberties have already been eroding for decades; what's worse, the cost of the erosion has been passed down the line. Far better for Congress to forswear dreaming up silly rules to begin with; agreeing to pay their cost only solves half the problem. But let us not quibble with progress in the right direction. The looming struggle to actually cut federal spending by billions of dollars may preclude any more erosions.<p>
Congratulations are also deserved for passing a tax cut and for stepping forth on welfare reform. Has the American public forgotten the promises made by then-Governor Bill Clinton when he campaigned for president? A middle-class tax cut? The end of welfare as we know it? The new House leadership promised both, and they, not Clinton, kept the promise.<p>
But a word of caution on the welfare-reform proposals: Just as limited congratulations are due for eliminating unfunded mandates, limited caution is due for proposing to send money to the states in the form of block grants with no strings attached. This will create, as someone has noted, "funded unmandates."<p>
For those of us in California, this is an interesting exercise in neofederalism—a tasty bit of proper philosophy, or revolutionary devolution, if you will. The warning is this: The California legislature, perhaps more than any other state legislature, has suffered from Congress-envy for at least the last three decades. If California legislators suddenly find billions of dollars dropped in their allegedly bare general-fund cupboard, what mischief might they do? Conservatives and libertarians alike want major programs such as welfare brought closer to us, closer to our scrutiny, closer to our effective control. Will we get what we want, or will we get a more fearsome monster than the current federal system? In this case, sense may have been sacrificed for speed; again, the federal government would do far better to reduce taxes, forswearing the revenue, than collecting and then returning the money in skewed proportions.<p>
All in all, hearty congratulations to the House Republican leadership! Promises made, promises kept—who could ask for more? At least, who could ask for more in the First Hundred Days? May the next five hundred days go as well! Legislators keeping promises—it might catch on.<p><I>

The Contract With America committed the House Republicans to raising and voting on each of the Contract items. This was accomplished and should be considered a major shift from politics as usual.<p>
One major frustration that Americans have expressed in recent years is that they vote for change but get only lip service from political leaders. The significance in the Contract With America is that a group of politicians did what they said they would. The Contract raises the level of political debate to one of performance and effectiveness, rather than distortion, political expediency, and misrepresentation by political officials, candidates, and parties.<p>
The greatness of these hundred days is that they changed the political process. The substantive change is yet to be determined. It is still too early to tell whether the policies passed by the House in the First Hundred Days will become law, and if so, what effect they will ultimately have on American life and culture.<p>
Even now, however, we can see a shifting of attitude among the American people. Inherent in the policy and legislative changes proposed in the Republicans' First Hundred Days are the notions of individual responsibility and accountability for one's actions. Government appears to be seen as a catalyst and facilitator for change, but not the ultimate determinant of the individual lives of our citizens.<p>
Major mistakes during the First Hundred Days include the failure to support term limits as forcefully as other elements of the Contract. The leadership vacillated and approached this issue tentatively. They should have committed firmly to this issue, which was approved in all of the 22 states where it was considered by the voters.<p>
The leadership allowed the debate to deteriorate into "them vs. us" on issues such as the school-lunch program and the group-home concept for unwed teenage mothers without stable homes of their own. The leadership allowed these ideas and "those conservative Republicans" supporting them to be portrayed as insensitive or callous. They should instead have placed the true nature of these issues at the center of the debate.<p><I>

Midge Decter - Trustee, The Heritage Foundation, speaking April 21, 1995, at The Heritage Foundation's Annual Board Meeting and Public Policy Seminar, San Diego, California.
<p>



DR. EDWIN J. FEULNER: It is my pleasure to introduce Heritage trustee Thomas "Dusty" Rhodes. Dusty has been officially on the Board of Heritage for a year and a half. In his earlier incarnation, he was a partner with the investment banking firm of Goldman Sachs. While Goldman Sachs is known to many in the room, I'm sure, for its considerable achievements in the investment world, it is not particularly known for its hospitality to conservatives. Perhaps on some other occasion we will have the opportunity for Dusty to tell us about Wall Street's political perspectives. Also in his earlier business incarnation, he was a Chief Financial Officer for commercial insurance in London.
<p>
	Dusty, in addition to his service on Heritage's Board, has brought a closer link between Heritage and National Review, the premier conservative magazine, of which Dusty is President. He also helps lead the Conservative Movement by his service as co-chairman of Town Hall, the conservative computer network. 
<P>
	 He has been active in the Conservative Movement for a number of years. He is one of the founders of the Project for the Republican Future, which has had such a salutary impact in formulating some of the specific debates on major public policy issues since it began about two years ago. 
<P>
	Dusty began a state think tank in New York, the Empire Foundation. He works very closely with another organization called Change New York, which is a grass-roots activist organization in New York. I was reading the New York Times not long ago about the new Governor, George Pataki, and alongside the article I saw Dusty's picture and noted that he serves as one of Pataki's chief advisors. 
<p>
	 Dusty is also a graduate of the Wharton School. In fact, Dusty and I were graduate school classmates. 
<p>
	 He has recently been appointed to the Board of the Bradley Foundation. Dusty, please introduce Midge.
<p>

DUSTY RHODES: When faced with a list of accomplishments -- so long and well-known -- one is tempted to say, "Midge Decter needs no introduction."  It's shorter, it's sweeter, it's somehow less boring. This list of accomplishments must be cited, however. It is only then that we see them in the context of Midge Decter's enormous energy, radiance, heroism, and humor.
<p>
	She wrote The Liberated Woman and Other Americans, The New Chastity, and other arguments against women's liberation; Liberal Parents, Radical Children; hundreds of pieces for Commentary, Harper's, Esquire, The Atlantic, National Review (my favorite magazine). 
<p>
	 She was the Executive Director of the Committee for the Free World, Managing Editor of Commentary, the Editor of CBS Legacy Books, Editor at the Hudson Institute, the Executive Editor of Harper's, Book Review Editor of Saturday Review World, and Senior Editor of Basic Books. 
<p>
	She is preparing the Erasmus Lecture to be delivered at the Institute for Religion and Public Life. She is frequently on TV and radio. She is the board chairman of the Clare Booth Luce Fund. She is a board member of the Center for Security Policy. And, most important, she is a board member here at The Heritage Foundation.
<p>
	When she first joined the Heritage Board she gave a speech saying how delighted she was. She said, "I decided to join the side I was on."  She has done all of these things while quietly raising four children; she is the grandmother of 10. She was heroic and prescient to have signaled, when it was dangerous to do so, the negative impact to be expected from the feminist movement as it gathered steam in the late '60s and '70s.
<p>
	She was heroic to have formed the Committee for the Free World knowing the controversies that would arise by being fervently anti-communist in an era of d‚tente.
<P>
	She is humorous. How many of us have laughed at her writing and speaking about the foibles of mankind?  Humorous and brilliant, she was ahead of her time; her critics were so wrong.
<P>
	She is humble. She always has time for us. Have you ever noticed that when she talks to you she is really listening?  Not like so many of us, looking over your shoulder ready to get to the next conversation.
<P>
	Father Richard Neuhaus, with whom Midge worked for years, tells of this major figure in the field of public policy disappearing into the mail room to help when there was a crunch.
<P>
	She has boundless energy and commitment. When she was 8 months pregnant with son John and had a 3 year old, a 9 year old, and a 10 year old, she packed, moved, unpacked, and wrote two articles. 
<P>
	 I have known Midge only for a few years, but we have covered a lot: the art and responsibility of raising children, magazine publishing, religion -- you name it. Together, we have marveled at the wonders of the Vatican and wondered about the Albanian definition of luxury. For me, it has been a blessing.
<P>
	I am honored to introduce a truly wonderful woman, Midge Decter.
<P>

MIDGE DECTER: We are gathered here primarily, of course, to celebrate a revolution: that glorious revolution whose anthem was set to music in 1964, whose first shot was fired in 1980, and whose armies are now, at last, in full headlong engagement.
<P>
	Before I begin with my own very particular celebration, however, I want to read you a classified document that was dropped on my desk the other day by a highly confidential source. This document is the transcript of a recent editorial meeting at the New York Times, one of the famous five o'clock meetings, usually presided over by the newspaper's executive editor, at which the next day's major stories are discussed. This particular meeting began with a challenge from the executive editor, who shall hereinafter be designated only as boss editor, to the various department editors. If you would bear with me for a few moments, I should like to read you this transcript verbatim. 
<P>
	 Boss editor: "The issue for today, gentlemen -- and I have to tell you I am both disappointed and disturbed about this -- the issue for today is, why haven't you people been able to tame Newt Gingrich the way we used to tame all the others?" 
<P>
	 The first one to respond is the Arts and Culture editor (who does, from the text here, seem to me to be a touch defensive): "What do you want?  We've just cost the guy four million dollars!"
<P>
	Boss editor: "Yes?  Well, I notice that hasn't stopped him. What about our reporters, for God's sake?  Have you guys so quickly forgotten Woodward and Bernstein and how they once put us to shame?"
<P>
	National news editor: "Boss, my boys are on the case night and day. Hardly an issue goes out that doesn't carry some item or other -- how he wants to starve poor schoolchildren, for instance -- that should be a major embarrassment to him"
<P>
	Here the editorial page editor interrupts: "And how about us?  Admit it, boss, you've never seen such editorials. Not even Ronald Reagan.... "
<P>
	At this point the transcript indicates there is a sudden silence, broken first by a gasp and then by a moan. "Can it be?"  -- this is the boss editor again -- "Can it be?"  everyone present repeats. "Can it be that this guy actually doesn't give a damn about what we think of him?  So what in Heaven's name do we do now?  Has anybody around here got something else for tomorrow's front page?  A new angle on the OJ trial?  A follow-up on last month's witchcraft story?  How about those UFO sightings.... "
<P>
	Here the transcript is cut off. I have read it in part to help you understand that whatever great things Newt Gingrich and Company may have done for the United States of America in general, they have performed one extra great service for regular readers of the New York Times. Truth to tell, they have given us back the pleasure of our morning coffee. 
<p>
	 You see, if you do it at all, you have got to read the Times first thing in the day; if you let it go till later or, God forbid, until evening, you will simply have no time off at all. And whereas for some years now we have been forced to greet each weekday morning -- not even to mention Sunday, oh awful!  -- whereas we have been forced to greet each morning with the newspaper in one hand and a bottle of Pepto Bismol in the other, now the only thing that might disturb our coffee-sipping is an occasional fit of the giggles. 
<P>
	 Just last week, for instance, there was a story about how a newly "resolute" Clinton was at last coming out from under the Republican shadow. He was stepping up his pace, said the Times: first there would be a fund-raising event at the home of Steven Spielberg -- now there's a sign of a real effort to be a resolute leader!  -- and from Steven Spielberg's house to Warm Springs, Georgia, for the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Take that, you conservatives!  Indeed, it is hard to know which is more amusing -- the Times's bewilderment in the face of a political development that refuses to fit the paper's long-held cozy assumptions about its importance to the world or the feebleness of its efforts to stand four-square behind a President it deeply despises. 
<P>
	 In any case, cheerful mornings are a very special gift of the 104th Congress to its Times-reading friends, one the Members might be surprised to hear about but which has earned them our deepest thanks all the same. 
<P>
	 I fear some of you may find all this rather frivolous, especially in the face of all our grave national problems. But let me assure you that there has for many years now been no graver problem facing this wonderful country than the establishment press and the mischief it has taken it upon itself to make, from Vietnam to the environment to health care and education to the enthronement of AIDS and homelessness. (Look, I know we are in San Diego, and I understand that the San Diegans may simply be too lucky to understand at first hand the kind of problem with the press that I am talking about. But people who get to read the Union should nevertheless be encouraged to have some compassion for the predicament of others.) 
<P>
	 Now, what has made it possible for the establishment press -- the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Time, Newsweek, and add whatever name you wish to this list -- to make such mischief is the sensitivity of politicians and government officials to the things that are said about them by their enemies. To the extent that there is a new class of legislators more concerned about what they can accomplish than about how they look to the Washington watchers, the media simply lose their power.
<P>
	And if for some reason you should happen to think that the newfound light-mindedness of such powers in the political land as the Times, the network news divisions -- and don't forget that age-old Washington mainstay The New Republic -- the light-mindedness and irrelevance that are nowadays the very hallmark of these institutions are anything other than a leading symptom of the general encroaching senility of liberalism, think again. Let me give you this month's leading example of what I mean by the senescence of liberalism, this time not a confidential document but a widely published and commented-on story. 
<P>
	 It seems that Harvard University recently offered early enrollment to a 19-year-old young lady who turned out on closer inspection to have some five years earlier bludgeoned her mother to death with a crystal candlestick and, when she saw that her mother was dead, stuck a knife into the woman's throat in order, she said, to make it look like a suicide. (A charming story, no?  For any of you who might be new to Heritage meetings, it has commonly been my role to entertain our friends with pleasant stories of this kind.) In any case, for this little mishap the girl received six months in what the papers referred to as a "locked facility."  Well, as you can imagine, poor old Harvard was in a pickle. Might there not be some problem about admitting into its august community an erstwhile matricide?  some officials thought. But on the other hand, said others, might it not be unjust to rescind her acceptance, which, since she was an excellent student, she had after all earned fair and square?
<P>
	It subsequently turned out that Columbia University had also accepted this young lady and has not yet made up its collective mind about what to do should Harvard in the end reject her after all. What has clearly been something of a puzzlement for the community of liberal educators, however, was no problem at all for the New York Times editorialist, who was without a day's hesitation happy to tell the Harvard admissions committee where its duty lay: The only course of justice, said the editorialist, was to accept this girl. She had after all served her six months, and in addition to being an excellent student, she had also helped to tutor poor children.
<P>
	If you were inclined to ask was there anyone, Harvard or no Harvard, from among all the officially designated precincts of liberalism to suggest that perhaps six months in juvenile hall, even with the doors locked, might not be an exactly suitable punishment for offing one's mother, the answer is a ringing no. This, my friends, is not mere senility; this is a political-cultural form of what the psychiatrists call senile dementia. 
<P>
	 Well, let the pundits and the pollsters say what they will, it is not the voters' pocketbooks but, rather, the way that the liberals have come more and more to respond to the horror of stories like mine as if it were merely caseload material for some skilled guidance counselor that really accounts for what happened on November 8th and what will be happening at the polls with greater and greater frequency in the future. People can live with and humor dementia for only so long before they say, "Stop!  This is crazy!  I need to get off!"
<P>
	When they tried to tell us this country is evil, we said, "So's your uncle!"  and went on about our business. When they tried to tell us there was no difference between men and women, we had more important things on our minds and tried to ignore it. When they tried to tell us that taking money away from working people in order to give it to idle people was only justice, we got angry but said, "Go fight city hall!"  When they tried to tell us that people dying of a certain venereal disease called AIDS were entitled on this account to society's special love and most tender consideration and that, besides, we were all potential victims, we were shocked but confused -- until, that is, some of us discovered that the liberal authorities wanted to teach six- and seven- and eight-year-olds how more carefully to go about doing the things that got you this disease. Then we weren't confused any more and understood that what was going on was an effort to recruit all the little kids for what most people called perversion but the liberals called "another lifestyle."
<P>
	For different people among us there were, of course, different straws that did the trick, but whichever it was, for most ordinary, honest people that camel's back has finally and forever been broken.
<P>
	So why are we at this meeting spending our time in serious discussion?  Why aren't we out in the streets dancing around the broken back of liberalism?  The answer is, of course, that we are doing both. (And those of you who are afraid that, given the past 40-45 years, your street-dancing might be a bit rusty, I advise that you see our master dancer Peter Pover, who has over the years lightened the load on many a pair of Heritage feet.) What we are discussing is precisely what we are also celebrating: namely, how to restore the most brilliantly invented government in the history of mankind to its rightful and necessary role both in the world and in the lives of its citizens. 
<P>
	 And yet. And yet. If there is one thing we ought to have learned by now, especially during the years of the Reagan presidency, it is that no President and no legislature can move very far beyond the limits set by the political culture. Newt Gingrich -- I speak of him now as the liberals speak of him: not as that particular man, but as the symbol of the revolution I was talking about -- Newt Gingrich the symbol is not some happy accident; he was prepared for, in meetings like these, by people like you and who knows how many tens of thousands of others, by arguments that have for years now been chipping away at the status quo like so many ax-blows at the base of a rotting tree.
<P>
	That is why, when all the so-called Washington insiders in a tone somewhere between desperation and triumph say things like "See, x percent of the American people don't even know what the Contract with America is," or, "See, this or that amendment to the Constitution hasn't got the votes," or "This or that piece of legislation won't pass the Senate," or "The President will veto it" -- when all the inside dopesters tell you that there really is no revolution, they are engaging in that very special form of rationalizing known as whistling past the graveyard. Deep down, they know that what passes or doesn't pass this year in the halls of Congress is only a pale reflection of what is really going on in this country.
<P>
	Because what is really going on is all of us: Newt and company and Heritage, which has of course already gone way beyond him, and you and me and that vast coalition of people who worry about textbooks, who worry about universities, who worry about the corruption of race relations, who worry about the criminal justice system, who worry about manners and morals, who worry that the greatest medical establishment in the world might be destroyed, who worry about the status of the English language, who worry lest the country be left once again without an adequate defense, who worry that the vast, productive machine that is the American economy is being fettered to the point of paralysis. These are in fact not separate worries; combined, they add up to what you might call Ronald Reagan's prayer: "Make us great again."
<P>
	Now, therefore, is the moment for us to remember that we are not only the makers of a revolution, but the heirs of a revolution -- the greatest and most benign revolution in the history of human affairs -- fought a little more than two hundred years ago by a band of settlers on this continent who believed they were struggling to secure for themselves the rights of free Englishmen and who in the process created the one truly revolutionary system: a system based on the proposition that all men are created equal, by which was meant that all men are created morally equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. This system was not born full-blown, but drew on centuries of experience and centuries'-worth of ideas developed in a country called England and then embodied in a set of political institutions freed up from the dead weight of the past out of which they had been carved. Our revolution, then, is not to make something new, but precisely to return to that system which is our blessed inheritance, to refresh it, and to rescue it from the hands of those who, in arrogance and carelessness and moral greed, have overlaid it with alien structures and ungrateful purposes.
<P>
	Ours is, in a way, actually a harder job than that undertaken by our American forefathers. For we have no new and virgin territory to repair to, but rather what is by now an old land -- the oldest continuing form of government in the world!  -- to clean up. We will not accomplish our purposes overnight, and we must not grow impatient. Each of those worries must be attended to, and none must be scanted.
<P>
	We must not, either, depend on others to do the job for us. We must not make the Newt Gingriches our water-carriers and throw up our hands when they fail. And fail they are bound to do sometimes. (While we are remembering that first revolution, let us remind ourselves that it took that revolution eighty years and a bloody fratricidal war to settle its affairs and another ninety to grant the moral equality of all men to black Americans.) The overlay that I spoke of -- the overlay of alien structures and ungrateful purposes -- has been a long time accumulating; it will not vanish by legislative fiat. 
<P>
	 The job is not only the politicians' to do nor even only the Heritage Foundation's, but ours as well, each and every one of us: as members of communities, as businessmen, as educators, as doctors, as soldiers and sailors, as philanthropists and parents -- perhaps especially as parents -- as churchgoers, as husbands and wives: in general, as citizens on our knees in gratitude for our inheritance from that band of men who once set out to claim the rights of free Englishmen and ended by creating the richest and most powerful of all the nations on Earth.
<P>
	So let us celebrate indeed. Not only what is at long last being accomplished in Washington and in our state legislatures and even maybe -- though I tremble to say it -- in our cities. Let us also celebrate our own need to carry on the fight. It will energize us, this need, and replenish us and keep us younger and more fit than ten thousand hours of running down streets or working out in gyms.
<P>
	One thing more: Many conservatives -- I include myself -- tend to be suspicious of good news. Perhaps it is in our nature as conservatives. We do not easily take yes for an answer. And we are soon to enter that silly season that leads up to presidential elections, where every day we follow the political stock market and feel rich with every up and poor with every down. I would caution us all, especially in honor of the man who at a critical moment was not afraid or embarrassed to say simply, "Make us great again," that it was to us and not to his minions in Washington that he was speaking. So let us pay more attention to what is in our own hands and under our own noses than to that political stock market.
<P>
	In other words, this revolution is not Newt Gingrich, not Phil Gramm, not Bob Dole or Lamar Alexander or... take your pick. It is YOU. What a heavy and happy responsibility!  What a grave and golden opportunity!
<P>
	Long live the revolution!

<h3>THE CASE FOR AND AGAINST NATURAL LAW</h3><P>
<b>By Russell Kirk </b><br>
July 15, 1993<br>

<P>

     The literature of natural law is complex, copious, and monthly
growing vaster.  All I aspire to accomplish in this second lecture on
"The Future of Justice" is to offer some general introduction to the
subject, together with reflections on the protections and dangers of
natural-law doctrines, and observations concerning natural law and
constitutional government.
<P>
      A great deal of loose talk about natural law has occurred in
very recent years.  It was objected to Judge Bork's nomination to the
Supreme Court that Bork did not believe in natural law; and when Judge
Thomas was interrogated for that bench, the objection was raised that
he did believe in natural law.  These protestations came mostly from
the same group of senators.  Clearly a good many public men and women
nowadays have only vague notions of what is signified by this term
natural law.
<P>
     Objectively speaking, natural law, as a term of politics and
jurisprudence, may be defined as a loosely knit body of rules of
action prescribed by an authority superior to the state.  These rules
variously (according to the several differing schools of natural-law
and natural-rights speculation) are derived from divine commandment;
from the nature of humankind; from abstract Reason; or from long
experience of mankind in community.
<P>
     But natural law does not appertain to states and courts merely. 
For primarily it is a body of ethical perceptions or rules governing
the life of the individual person, quite aside from politics and
jurisprudence.  When many persons ignore or flout the natural law for
human beings, the consequences presently are ruinous -- as with the
unnatural vices that result in the disease of AIDS, or with the
ideological passions, defying the norm of justice, that have ravaged
most nations since the First World War.
<P>
     The natural law should not be taken for graven Tables of
Governance, to be followed to jot and tittle; appealed to in varying
circumstances, the law of nature must be applied with high prudence. 
As Alessandro d'EntrevSs writes, "The lesson of natural law is in fact
nothing but an assertion that law is a part of ethics."  And, he
concludes "The lesson of natural law [is] simply to remind the jurist
of his own limitations....   This point where values and norms
coincide, which is the ultimate origin of law and at the same time the
beginning of moral life proper, is, I believe, what men for over two
thousand years have indicated by the name of natural law."
<P>
     On the one hand, natural law must be distinguished from positive
or statutory law, decreed by the state; on the other, from the "laws
of nature" in a scientific sense -- that is, from propositions
expressing the regular order of certain natural phenomena.  Also
natural law sometimes is confounded with assertions of "natural
rights," which may or may not be founded upon classical and medieval
concepts of natural law.
<P>
     The most important early treatise on natural law is Cicero's De
Re Publica.  The Ciceronian understanding of natural law, which still
exercises strong influence, was well expressed in the nineteenth
century by Froude:  "Our human laws are but the copies, more or less
imperfect, of the eternal laws so far as we can read them, and either
succeed and promote our welfare, or fail and bring confusion and
disaster, according as the legislator's insight has detected the true
principle, or has been distorted by ignorance or selfishness."
<P>
     As interpreted by the Roman jurisconsult, and later by the
medieval Schoolmen and Canonists -- Thomas Aquinas especially -- the
legacy of the classical jus naturale endured with little challenge
until the seventeenth century.  In England during the sixteenth
century it was powerfully upheld by Richard Hooker in his Laws of
Ecclesiastical Polity.  In the Christian world the natural law was
received as a body of unwritten rules depending upon universal
conscience and common sense, ascertainable by right reason.  But with
the stirrings of secularism and rationalism during the seventeenth
century, a new interpretation of "natural law" began to develop,
conspicuous (near the end of the century) in the works of Hugo Grotius
and Baron Samuel von Pufendorf.  This latter secularized concept of
natural law was held by many of the philosophes of the eighteenth
century, and took on flesh during the French Revolution, when it was
vulgarized by Thomas Paine.
<P>
     Nevertheless, the older understanding of natural law was not
extinguished.  It was ringingly reasserted by Edmund Burke, in his
distinction between the "real" and the "pretended" rights of men. 
Through the disciples of Burke, and through the influence of the
Catholic Church, the classical and Christian natural law has
experienced a revival in the latter half of the twentieth century.
<P>
     During the nineteenth century, natural-law concepts were
overshadowed by the powerful Utilitarian system of Jeremy Bentham; by
the theories of John Austin and the Analytical Jurists; by legal
positivism; and later -- particularly in the United States -- by legal
pragmatism.  In the United States, the older and newer schools of
natural law have contended against each other since the latter half of
the eighteenth century, and both have been hotly assailed by
positivistic, utilitarian, and pragmatic interpretations of law.  Yet
appeals to the "natural law" or "a higher law" have recurred often in
American politics and jurisprudence; both conservatives and radicals,
from time to time, have invoked this law of nature
<P>
     The Catholic Church continues to adhere to the classical and
Thomistic understanding of the natural law -- to an apprehension of
Justice that is rooted in the wisdom of the species.  Sir Ernest
Barker put thus the idea of natural law:  "This justice is conceived
as being the higher or ultimate law, proceeding from the nature of the
universe from the Being of God and the reason of man.  It follows that
law -- in the sense of the law of the last resort -- is somehow above
lawmaking."
<P>
     The most lucid and popular exposition of natural law it to be
found in the Appendix, "Illustrations of the Tao," to C.  S.  Lewis's
little book The Abolition of Man.  Therein Lewis distinguishes eight
major natural laws of universal recognition and application, together
with several illustrations of each, drawn from a wide diversity of
cultures, religions, philosophical discourses, and countries.  He
expounds the Law of General Beneficence; the Law of Special
Beneficence; Duties to Parents, Elders, Ancestors; Duties to Children
and Posterity; the Law of Justice; the Law of Good Faith and Veracity;
the Law of Mercy; the Law of Magnanimity.  No code of the laws of
nature ever having existed, it is ineffectual to try to enforce that
body of ethical principles through courts of law; no judge hands down
decisions founded directly upon the admonition, "Honor thy father and
thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land" -- or the
Commandment's equivalents in the Babylonian List of Sins, the Egyptian
Confession of the Righteous Soul, the Manual of Epictetus, Leviticus,
the Analects, or Hindu books of wisdom.  Nevertheless, such perpetual
precepts lie behind the customs and the statutes that shelter father
and mother.
<P>
     So much, succinctly, by way of definition.  Turn we now to the
difficulty of explaining natural law to the average sensual man. 
Permit me to discourse with you for a little while about natural law
and the moral imagination.  Incidentally, I am helped here by an
unpublished essay by the late Raymond English, who understood and
praised the natural law, and understood and despised the claims for
"natural right."  Let me quote English directly:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> The natural law cannot be understood except through the
     elements of poetry and imagination in the soul.  The poetic
     and the moral imagination are parts of human reason.  For
     the man who does not feel himself in some sense a child of
     God, who is not possessed by the "desire and pursuit of the
     whole," and for whom words like honor are meaningless, the
     notion of natural law must be a Mumbojumbo, a bogle to make
     children behave tolerably well, a fantasy from the
     adolescence or the childhood of the race.  Poets, James
     Elroy Flecker says, are those who swear that Beauty lives
     although lilies die; and the natural law is the poetry of
     political science, the assurance that Justice lives though
     states are imperfect and ephemeral.  Justice is to politics
     what beauty is to art; indeed, beauty and justice become
     almost identical at the highest levels of human aspiration.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Permit me, ladies and gentlemen, to repeat here that the natural
law is more than a guide for statesmen and jurists.  It is meant
primarily for the governance of persons -- for you and me, that we may
restrain will and appetite in our ordinary walks of life.  Natural law
is not a harsh code that we thrust upon other people:  rather, it is
an ethical knowledge, innate perhaps, but made more clearly known to
us through the operation of right reason.  And the more imagination
with which a person is endowed, the more will he apprehend the essence
of the natural law, and understand its necessity.  If such a one,
despite his power of imagination, offends against the natural law, the
greater must be his suffering.  So I have discovered in the course of
a peregrine life.  And over a good many decades I have found that most
contemners of the natural law are dull dogs, afflicted by a paucity of
imagination.  As Adam Mickiewicz instructs us: 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Your soul deserves the place to which it came, If having
     entered Hell, you feel no flame.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Such is the case for the importance of natural law.  Permit me to
turn now to the case against natural law, as expressed by the legal
positivists -- most strongly, perhaps, by the German scholar Hans
Kelsen.  They regard natural law as a body of sentimental fictions;
they hold that the state is the only true source of law.  The views of
John Austin and the Analytical Jurists are similar:  all law is
decreed by the political sovereign, they hold.  Rather than moving
abstractly among the several schools of jurisprudence in the twentieth
century, I offer you now the contents of a letter I received recently
from a German inventor and industrialist who had read in the Bavarian
magazine Epoche some remarks of mine on natural law.  My correspondent
is a very intelligent and indeed talented man, considerable of a
naturalist in that he studies flora and fauna.  In politics, I suppose
he may be classified as a German liberal of the old school.  His
communication, refreshingly innocent of the jargon of jurisprudence
and ethics, suggests the mentality that lies behind the denigration of
natural law by positivists and secular humanists, who recognize and
deride the Christian and the classical origins of the idea of natural
law.
<P>
     "Whether the term 'law of nature' is more frequently used
nowadays, or whether the jus naturale is an old invention," my German
correspondent begins, "I think this term is wrong and misleading. 
There is no law or legislative system which can be derived from
nature.  Nature has rules developed during evolution, but there is
only a jus hominis and no jus naturale."
<P>
     
<BLOCKQUOTE>
     "In other words," my friend goes on, 
<P>
     all ethical norms are developed and worked out by human
     beings, in this case mostly by the homo stultus, subspecies
     sapiens....   The order of nature follows in many respects
     the right of the stronger, which, in fact, keeps nature with
     all its plants and animals in excellent shape.  But mankind
     has set up ethical rules, good ones and bad ones, very
     different from natural rules.  Many of these man-made rules
     are quite bad, sinning against nature.... 
<P>
     
     The very deplorable situation of the species homo stultus
     comes from wrong ethical rules, which are against nature.  I
     am not pleading for the right of the stronger between human
     beings, but for more influence of the rare subspecies
     sapiens, especially of those individuals who understand
     nature -- which means also the nature of human character. 
     Unfortunately Jesus did not understand the real nature of
     men; nor do the socialists understand it when they expect
     that people will work for the state rather than for
     themselves.... 
<P>
     
     I offer another example, in which American legislators have
     chosen the wrong solution.  There is a law in the United States,
     if I am correct, which forbids the killing of foreign heads of
     state.  If I am correct this is concerned with clandestine
     actions, e.g.  by the CIA.  This law is unethical.  Assuming that
     no American president or the American government plans to
     eliminate a foreign dictator just for fun, but rather because he
     is a danger to the United States or to his own people or both,
     then removing a dictator as soon as possible would save the lives
     of many; and is, in consequence, completely justified.
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

     We should agree that right is an exclusively human creation. 
     What is regarded as rightful by one group of people within a
     community, can be regarded as wrongful by another group.  I
     seek a terminology where there is a clean and clear
     distinction between what comes from nature and what comes
     from human efforts.  Human efforts are aimed very often,
     with the best intentions, in the wrong direction.  I mean
     "wrong" in this sense:  against nature, for nature cannot be
     neglected without harming the human race.... 
<P>
     Failing to realize that often human character is bad must lead to
     destroying a society through leniency.  We have to determine when
     our ethical laws accord with nature and when they counteract
     nature.  We must not ignore "the rule of the fittest," when we
     decide to kill a dictator, for instance.  We acknowledge the
     right of every nation to use as much force as possible when
     fighting another nation to death.  The fight between nations
     follows what could be called natural right, but is better called
     the rule of nature.
<P>
     For this German correspondent of mine, you will have noted,
"nature" signifies animal nature, Darwinian nature, red in tooth and
claw.  Therefore he despises appeals to natural law, and believes that
not only all positive or traditional law, but all ethical principles,
are human creations merely.  And these human contrivances, he implies,
sometimes may be mistaken; we might be wiser to found our human
institutions on the principle of competition, favoring the fitter.
<P>
     Here, I suggest, we perceive the mentality that lies back of the
jurisprudence of Hans Kelsen and certain other positivists:  critics
of the whole concept of natural law.
<P>
     Yet in one matter my correspondent does turn to the extreme
medicine of natural law:  his commendation of tyrannicide.  This is
interesting, as it is related to Germany in this century.
<P>
     German jurisprudence demands that the citizen be strictly
obedient to the state, for the state is the source of all law, the
omniscient keeper of the peace.  No law but positive law has been
recognized in Germany since the fall of the German monarchy; natural
law has no place at all.
<P>
     Adolph Hitler, chosen Reichschancellor by lawful means, and
confirmed in power by the Reichstag in 1933, was sustained later by
national plebiscites.  He was the head of the German state, the source
of all law, to which all Germans had been taught obedience.  Yet
certain Germans -- army officers, scholars, professional people,
chiefly -- found his actions evil.  By quasi-constitutional means he
had subverted the constitution.  His popularity had become tremendous,
and his military power.  Only by death might he be removed.
<P>
     Therefore a little knot of brave and conscientious men determined
to save Germany and Europe by killing Hitler.  They had been reared in
the doctrine that all citizens must obey the inerrant state.  In this
exigency, however, they turned to doctrines of natural law for
justification.  Was there no remedy against an unnatural master of the
state?  In the teachings of natural law they discerned a fatal remedy. 
Fatal to them, at least; for nearly all of the heroic men involved in
the several conspiracies against Hitler died frightful deaths.  I knew
well Dr.  Ludwig Freund, a kindly professor of political science, one
of the two survivors of the first plot to kill Hitler.  By nature
Professor Freund was a law-abiding gentleman.  And being law-abiding,
in defense of true law he was prepared to slay the chief of state,
perverter of Germany's laws and the laws of man's nature.
<P>
     I repeat that we have recourse to natural law, as opposed to
positive law, only as a last resort, ordinarily.  My only service as a
jurist occurred in Morton Township, Mecosta County, some decades ago,
when for two consecutive terms I was elected -- unanimously -- justice
of the peace.  When determining a disputed boundary between two farms,
a justice of the peace does not repair to theories of natural law and
meditate upon which of two claimants is the more worthy of judicial
compassion; rather, the justice of the peace turns to statute, common
law, possibly to local custom -- and to the files of the recorder of
deeds at the county seat.  And so it is with the ordinary
administration of law at every level.  Statute, charter, and
prescription ordinarily are sufficient to maintain the rule of law --
the end of which, we ought not to forget, is to keep the peace.
<P>
     Yet to guide the sovereign; the chief of state; the legislator;
the public prosecutor; the judge when, in effect, he sits in equity --
to guide you and me, indeed -- there endures the natural law, which in
essence is man's endeavor to maintain a moral order through the
operation of a mundane system of justice.  Unlike my German
correspondent, the sustainer of natural law knows that there is law
for man, and law for thing; and that our moral order is not the
creation of coffee-house philosophers.  Human nature is not vulpine
nature, leonine nature, or serpentine nature.  Natural law is bound up
with the concept of the dignity of man, and with the experience of
humankind ever since the beginnings of social community.
<P>
     It will not do to substitute private interpretations of natural
law for common law or civil law, any more than it would have been well
for England, during the Reformation, to have obeyed the "Geneva Men"
by sweeping away common law and the whole inherited apparatus of
parliamentary statutes, to substitute the laws of the ancient Jews. 
Positive law and customary law, in any country, grow out of a people's
experience in community; natural law should have its high part in
shaping and restraining positive and customary laws, but natural law
could not conceivably supplant judicial institutions.  Yet were
natural-law concepts to be abandoned altogether -- why, then, indeed,
the world would find itself governed by
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> The good old rule, the good old plan, That they shall take
     who have the power,And they shall keep who can.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Turn we now to relationships between the natural law and the
American judiciary.  Not since Associate Justice Joseph Story adorned
the Supreme Court of the United States, early in the nineteenth
century, has any member of the Supreme Court had much to say about
natural law.  Nevertheless, in recent decades a number of Supreme
Court decisions seem to have been founded upon natural-law notions of
a sort.  I think, for instance, of the Warren Court's decision (the
opinion written by Chief Justice Warren himself) that congressional
districts within the several states must be so drawn in their
boundaries as to contain so nearly as possible the same number of
persons within the several districts -- a matter previously left to
the discretion of state legislatures.  In part, this intervention was
founded upon Jeremy Bentham's principle of one man, one vote; but also
there seems to have lurked at the back of the minds of justices the
notion that exact political equality, as told by numbers, somehow is
"natural," whatever state and federal constitutions might prescribe
and whatever the opinions of the Framers may have been.  One might
cite, too, the Court's decisions in the school-desegregation cases.   
This question having been raised, let us examine how far we should
appeal to natural law against statute and Constitution.  Here we turn
to an historical example and to the judgment of a leading American
political and religious writer who endeavored to reconcile the claims
of authority and the claims of freedom.
<P>
     I refer to the "higher law" controversy of 1850 and to Orestes
Brownson, the Catholic scholar and polemicist.  In March 1850, on the
floor of the United States Senate, William Henry Seward made his
famous declaration that there exists "a higher law than the
Constitution."  He was referring to the Fugitive Slave Law and the
Supreme Court.  At once a hot controversy arose.  In January 1851,
Brownson published his review-essay entitled "The Higher Law," in
which he refuted the claim of Seward, the Abolitionists, and the Free-
Soilers to transcend the Constitution by appealing to a moral "higher
law" during debate on the Fugitive Slave Bill.
<P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> Brownson agreed with Seward that 
<P>
     there is a higher law than the Constitution.  The law of God
     is supreme, and overrides all human enactments, and every
     human enactment incompatible with it is null and void from
     the beginning, and cannot be obeyed with a good conscience,
     for "we must obey God rather than men."  This is the great
     truth statesmen and lawyers are extremely prone to overlook,
     which the temporal authority not seldom practically denies,
     and on which the Church never fails to insist.... 
<P>
     But the concession of the fact of a higher law than the
     Constitution does not of itself justify the appeal to it
     against the Constitution, either by Mr.  Seward or the
     opponents of the Fugitive Slave Law.  Mr.  Seward had no
     right, while holding his seat in the Senate under the
     Constitution, to appeal to the higher law against the
     Constitution, because that was to deny the very authority by
     which he held his seat....  After having taken his oath to
     support the Constitution, the Senator had, so far as he was
     concerned, settled the question, and it was no longer for
     him an open question.  In calling God to witness his
     determination to support the Constitution, he had called God
     to witness his conviction of the compatibility of the
     Constitution with the law of God, and therefore left himself
     no plea for appealing from it to a higher law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     We cannot be bound, Brownson continued, to obey a law that is in
contravention of the law of God. 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> This is the grand principle held by the old martyrs, and
     therefore they chose martyrdom rather than obedience to the
     state commanding them to act contrary to the Divine law. 
     But who is to decide whether a special civil enactment be or
     be not repugnant to the law of God?  Here is a grave and
     perplexing question for those who have no divinely
     authorized interpreter of the divine law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     The Abolitionists and Free-Soilers, Brownson remarked, had
adopted the Protestant principle of private judgment. 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> But this places the individual above the state, and is
     wholly incompatible with the simplest conception of civil
     government.  No civil government can exist, none is
     conceivable even, when every individual is free to disobey
     its orders whenever they do not happen to square with his
     private convictions of what is the law of God.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     The Church, Brownson writes, is the authoritative interpreter of
the divine law.  He reminds his readers that the state is ordained of
God; but the state is not the supreme and infallible organ of God's
will on earth. 
<P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> Now it is clear that Mr.  Seward and his friends, the
     Abolitionists and the Free Soilers, have nothing to which
     they can appeal from the action of government but their
     private interpretation of the law of God, that is to say,
     their own private judgment or opinion as individuals; for it
     is notorious that they are good Protestants, holding the
     pretended right of private judgment, and rejecting all
     authoritative interpretation of the Divine law.  To appeal
     from government to private judgment is to place private
     judgment above public authority, the individual above the
     state, which, as we have seen, is incompatible with the very
     existence of government, and therefore, since government is
     a divine ordinance, absolutely forbidden by the law of God
     -- that very higher law invoked to justify resistance to
     civil enactments....  No man can ever be justifiable in
     resisting the civil law under the pretence that it is
     repugnant to the Divine law, when he has only his private
     judgment, or, what is the same thing, his private
     interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures, to tell him what
     the Divine law is on the point in question, because the
     principle on which he would act in doing so would be
     repugnant to the very existence of government, and therefore
     in contravention of the ordinance, therefore of the law, of
     God.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Brownson's argument -- which we have not time enough to analyze
in full today -- in substance is this, in his own words:  "Mr.  Seward
and his friends asserted a great and glorious principle, but
misapplied it."  It was not for them to utter commands in the name of
God.  Their claims, if carried far enough, would lead to anarchy.  The
arguments of some of their adversaries would lead to Statolatry, the
worship of the state.
<P><BLOCKQUOTE> The cry for liberty abolishes all loyalty, and destroys the
     principle and the spirit of obedience, while the usurpations
     of the state leave to conscience no freedom, to religion no
     independence.  The state tramples on the spiritual
     prerogatives of the Church, assumes to itself the functions
     of schoolmaster and director of consciences, and the
     multitude clap their hands, and call it liberty and
     progress!</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
     Brownson advocated compliance with the Fugitive Slave Law, which
clearly was constitutional; indeed, obligatory under Article IV,
Section 2 of the Constitution It was his hope to avert the Civil War
which burst out ten years later.  "Now there is a right and a wrong
way of defending the truth, and it is always easier to defend the
truth on sound than on unsound principles," he wrote.  "If men were
less blind and headstrong, they would see that the higher law can be
asserted without any attack upon legitimate civil authority, and
legitimate civil authority and the majesty of the law can be
vindicated without asserting the absolute supremacy of the civil
power, and falling into statolatry -- as absurd a species of idolatry
as the worship of sticks and stones."
<P>
     Very possibly, ladies and gentlemen, you have found in these
passages from "The Higher Law" and in Brownson's general argument
various considerations highly relevant to our own era.
<P>
     As Brownson remarks, the natural law (or law of God) and the
American civil law are not ordinarily at swords' points.  Large
elements of natural law entered into the common law of England -- and
therefore into the common law of the United States -- over the
centuries; and the Roman law, so eminent in the science of
jurisprudence, expresses the natural law enunciated by the Roman
jurisconsults.  No civilization ever has attempted to maintain the bed
of justice by direct application of natural-law doctrines by
magistrates; necessarily, it is by edict, rescript, and statute that
any state keeps the peace through a system of courts.  It simply will
not do to maintain that private interpretation of natural law should
be the means by which conflicting claims are settled.
<P>
     Rather, natural law ought to help form the judgments of the
persons who are lawmakers -- whether emperors, kings, ecclesiastics,
aristocratic republicans, or representatives of a democracy.  The
civil law should be shaped in conformity to the natural law -- which
originated, in Cicero's words, "before any written law existed or any
state had been established."
<P>
     It does not follow that judges should be permitted to push aside
the Constitution, or statutory laws, in order to substitute their
private interpretations of what the law of nature declares.  To give
the judiciary such power would be to establish what might be called an
archonocracy, a domination of judges, supplanting the constitutional
republic; also it surely would produce some curious and unsettling
decisions, sweeping away precedent, which would be found highly
distressing by friends to classical and Christian natural law.  Only
the Catholic Church, Brownson reasoned, has authority to interpret the
laws of nature; but the Supreme Court of the United States, and the
inferior federal courts, and our state courts, take no cognizance of
papal encyclicals.  Left to their several private judgments of what is
"natural," some judges indubitably would do mischief to the person and
the republic.  The Supreme Court's majority decision in the case of
Roe v.  Wade -- in which a pretended "right of privacy," previously
unknown, was discovered -- in actuality amounted to a declaration of
the "natural right" of a mother to destroy her offspring.
<P>
     Now it seems to me curiously naive to fancy that American courts
always would subscribe to Thomistic concepts of the laws of nature,
and abjure Jacobin doctrines of natural right.  Courts of law must
ordinarily accord with the general legislative authority; otherwise
the Book of Judges is followed by the Book of Kings.
<P>
     In the seventh edition of The Conservative Mind, I have written
that the first canon of conservative thought is "Belief in a
transcendent order, or body of natural law.  Political problems, at
bottom, are religious and moral problems.  A narrow rationality, which
Coleridge called the Understanding, cannot of itself satisfy human
needs....   True politics is the art of apprehending and applying the
Justice which ought to prevail in a community of souls."
<P>
     Now Mr.  Robert Bork, whose opinion as to the application of
natural-law doctrines by members of the Supreme Court I have just now
endorsed with some vigor, has taken notice of this.  In an essay
entitled "Natural Law and the Constitution," Mr.  Bork advises my
friend Mr.  William Bentley Ball to abjure my exhortation of this
sort.  "The dictum also is inaccurate," Bork adds, "for it arbitrarily
disqualifies as conservatives people who accept and struggle to
preserve every conservative value but who do not believe that such
values derive from a transcendent order."  One might as well say, I
suggest, that the Church ought not to emphasize the dogma of the
Resurrection because that might alienate some people who are not
Christians, but are possible well-wishers.
<P>
     I have thought highly of Mr.  Bork -- although he seems to have
no clear understanding of natural law and its function -- but he
appears to have thought lowly of me.  Perhaps we both have been
mistaken.
<P>
     That federal judges, Mr.  Bork included, have not been learned in
the natural law is one of the educational misfortunes of our age. 
When the time is out of joint, we can repair to the teachings of
Cicero and Aquinas and Hooker about the law of nature, in the hope
that we may diminish man's inhumanity unto man.  The natural law
lacking, we may become so many Cains, and every man's hand may be
raised against every other man's.<P>

<title> The Meaning of "Justice" - Heritage</title>

<CENTER><H3><I>THE MEANING OF "JUSTICE"</I></H3>

<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Lecture #457<br>
March 4, 1993<br>

<p>

     The word "justice" is on everyone's lips nowadays, and may
signify almost anything.  We hear the cry "Peace and Justice!"  from
folk who would destroy existing societies with fire and sword.  Other
folk fancy that perfect justice might readily be obtained by certain
financial rearrangements -- as if anything in this world ever could be
perfected.  One thinks of the observation of William James:  "So long
as one poor cockroach suffers the pangs of unrequited love, this world
will not be a moral world."  At the end of the twentieth century, the
liberal mentality demands justice for roaches, too.
<P>
     All confusion about the meaning of the word "justice"
notwithstanding, the latest edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica
contains no article under the heading "Justice."  Yet there is a
succinct article about justices of the peace, of whose number I once
was one, before the state of Michigan swept away that high office.  My
lecture today may be regarded as the attempt of a fool, rushing in
where the angelic Britannica fears to tread.  Yet possibly the nature
of justice may be apprehended by a mere quondam justice of the peace: 
for the fundamental purpose of law is to keep the peace.  "Justice is
the ligament which holds civilized beings and civilized nations
together," said Daniel Webster at the funeral of Justice Joseph Story,
in 1845; and so say I today.
<P>
     I propose in this series of four lectures to discuss first the
signification of this word "justice"; in my second lecture, to examine
natural law; in my third, to deal with criminal justice; in my
concluding lecture, to quarrel with certain notions of justice that
have been much puffed up during recent years.  In the twenty-first
century of the Christian era, will justice signify anything more than
the state's rigorous enforcement of its edicts?  Such questions I hope
to raise in your minds. 
<P>
<P>
      Nowadays, near the close of the twentieth century, moral and
political disorders bring grave confusion about the meanings of old
words.  As T.  S.  Eliot wrote in "Burnt Norton" -- 
Words strain,
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Crack and sometimes break, under the burden, Under the
     tension, slip, slide, perish, Decay with imprecision, will
     not stay in place, Will not stay still.  Shrieking voices
     Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering, Always assail them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
     Conspicuous among such venerable words, in our era often abused
and misrepresented, is this necessary word justice.  Today I am
attempting to purify the dialect of the tribe -- to borrow another
phrase from my old friend Eliot, who endeavored lifelong to rescue
words from the clutch of the vulgarizer or of the ideologue.
<P>
     Permit me first to offer preliminary descriptions or definitions
of this word justice.  Jeremy Taylor, in the middle of the seventeenth
century, wrote that there exist two kinds of justice.  The one is
commutative justice, or reciprocal justice, expressed in Scripture
thus:  "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, even so do to
them."  In Taylor's words, "This is the measure...  of that justice
which supposes exchange of things profitable for things profitable,
that as I supply your need, you may supply mine; as I do a benefit to
you, I may receive one by you....  "
<P>
     The other kind is distributive justice, expressed in this passage
from Romans:  "Render to all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is
due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor;
owe no man anything but to love one another."  Upon this Taylor
comments, "This justice is distinguished from the first, because the
obligation depends not upon contract or express bargain, but passes
upon us by some command of God, or of our superior, by nature or by
grace, by piety or religion, by trust or by office, according to that
commandment, 'As every man hath received the gift, so let him minister
the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of
God.'"
<P>
     But perhaps, ladies and gentlemen, I proceed too fast; I shall
have more to say a little later about the Christian concept of
justice.  Just now a little about the classical idea of justice.  The
classical definition, which comes to us through Plato, Aristotle,
Saint Ambrose, and Saint Augustine of Hippo, is expressed in a single
phrase:  suum cuique, or "to each his own."  As this is put in
Justinian's Corpus Juris Civilis, "Justice is a habit whereby a man
renders to each one his due with constant and perpetual will." 
Aristotle instructs us that the prevalence of injustice makes clear
the meaning of justice.  Also Aristotle remarks that it is unjust to
treat unequal things equally -- a principle to which I shall return in
my later lectures.  Of the virtue called justice, Saint Augustine
declares, "Justice is that ordering of the soul by virtue of which it
comes to pass that we are no man's servant, but servants of God
alone."
<P>
     Upon such ancient postulates, classical or Christian, rests our
whole elaborate edifice of law here in these United States -- even
though few Americans know anything about the science of jurisprudence. 
For public order is founded upon moral order, and moral order arises
from religion -- a point upon which I mean to touch later in this talk
of mine.  If these venerable postulates are flouted or denied -- as
they have been denied by the Marxists in the present century, and were
denied by sophists in Plato's time -- then arbitrary power thrusts
justice aside, and "they shall take who have the power, and they shall
keep who can."
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
     All these brief definitions require explanation.  But for the
moment I pass on to the common understanding, the common sense, of the
meaning of justice.  All of us here present, I suppose, entertain some
notion of what justice signifies.  From what source do we obtain such
a concept?  Why, very commonly, from observation of a just man or a
just woman.  We begin by admiring someone -- he may be some famous
judge, or he may be an obscure neighbor -- who accords to every person
he encounters that person's due.  Just men, in short, establish the
norm of justice.  When I began to write my book The Conservative Mind,
I discovered that the abstraction "conservatism" amounts to a general
term descriptive of the beliefs and actions of certain eminent men and
women whom we call "conservative" because they have endeavored to
protect and nurture the Permanent Things in human existence.  So it is
with justice:  in large part, we learn the meaning of justice by
acquaintance with just persons.
<P>
     In the ancient world, the most just of men was Solon, Athens'
lawgiver, poet, and hero.  As Solon wrote of his reform of the
Athenian constitution -- 
<P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> Such power I gave the people as might do, Abridged not what
     they had, nor lavished new; Those that were great in wealth
     and high in place My counsel likewise kept from all
     disgrace.  Before them both I kept my shield of might, And
     let not either touch the other's right.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     To each class, that is, Solon gave its due, and so preserved the
peace:  that is social justice. 
<P>
     But we need not turn to the pages of Plutarch to discover just
men:  they are not an extinct species, though perhaps an endangered
one.  I think of my grandfather, Frank Pierce, a bank-manager in
Plymouth, twenty miles north of Detroit.  He was the leading man of
Lower Town (now called Old Town), near the railroad yards -- not
because he was either rich or charismatic, but because he was just. 
Justice, of course, is one of the cardinal virtues; and like the other
virtues, justice is said to be its own reward -- which is well, the
virtue of justice seldom earning material rewards.  When a member of
the town council, my grandfather refused to supply water free of
charge to the town's principal industrial plant, on the grounds that
if the factory couldn't pay water bills, who could?  For that offense,
the firm's president swore he would have Pierce discharged by the
bank; but the bank's president happening also to be a just man, my
grandfather's livelihood was not swept away.  My grandfather's counsel
was sought by everyone in the Lower Town who needed advice; and his
kindliness even moved him, on occasion, to extend interest-free
personal loans, from his own pocket, to young married couples who
could not meet the requirements for loans from the bank.  (His salary
was two hundred dollars a month.) I do not mean that he was
indiscriminately sentimental; not at all.  On the several occasions
when robbers invaded his branch bank, he successfully repelled them,
at great risk:  for the just man defends vigorously whatever is
entrusted to his charge, and sets his face against the lawless.  He
was just to children, too:  taking me on long walks, during which we
talked of everything under the sun, but rapping sharply on the dining-
room table when I waxed impudent at meals -- I immediately abashed and
repentant.  By watching this kindly paterfamilias, and listening to
what he said, I came to apprehend justice quite early.  For Frank
Pierce gave every man his due, without fear or favor.
<P>
     In every society, from the most primitive to the most decadent,
there are found some persons, like my grandfather, whom everyone
recognizes as just.  (Even bank-robbers and kidnappers -- for he was
kidnapped once by desperados -- remarked that Frank Pierce was a just
man.) From what source do such just men and women derive their habits
or principles of justice?
<P>
     Are they familiar with jurisprudential theories?  Only rarely: 
even most judges on the bench nowadays are not well grounded in the
philosophy of law.  My grandfather, who possessed a substantial
library -- perhaps the only library in Plymouth's Lower Town -- read
history, but not philosophy or law.
<P>
     Are their concepts of justice learnt in church?  Not so,
ordinarily.  My grandfather never attended church:  he came from a
family that began as Pilgrims to Massachusetts and gradually moved
through all the American stages of the dissidence of dissent.  He
never read the Bible at home.  He inherited Christian morals, but not
Christian faith in the transcendent.
<P>
     Do they create for themselves a rough-and-ready utilitarian
scheme for the administering of justice, founded principally upon
their private experience of the human condition?  Only infrequently, I
think; for most of them would subscribe to the maxim of Benjamin
Franklin, "Experience is a hard master, but fools will have no other."
<P>
     Well, then, how do just men and women apprehend the meaning of
justice?  From tradition, I maintain:  from habits and beliefs that
have long persisted within family and within local community. 
Aristophanes, contradicting Socrates, argued that virtue cannot be
taught in schools or by tutors:  rather, virtue inheres in old
families.  I believe that to be especially true of the cardinal virtue
called justice.  Or this tradition of justice, families and
communities aside, may become known through private reading, perhaps: 
anyone who attentively reads the great Victorian novelists, say,
cannot well escape absorbing, even if unaware of his acquisition,
principles of personal and social justice.  More obvious, if more rare
nowadays, is the influence of the Greek and Roman classics toward
forming an affection for justice.  Until well into the nineteenth
century, Cicero was studied in every decent school; and this passage
from that statesman-philosopher implanted an apprehension of the
nature of justice:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Law is the highest reason, implanted in nature, which
     commands what ought to be done and forbids the opposite. 
     This reason, when firmly fixed and fully developed in the
     human mind, is law.  And so they believe that law is
     intelligence, whose natural function it is to command right
     conduct and forbid wrongdoing.  They think that this quality
     has derived its name in Greek from the idea of granting to
     every man his own, and in our language I believe it has been
     named from the idea of choosing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
     In short, there exists a literary tradition expounding the idea
of justice.  The most recent popular example of this tradition is to
be found in an appendix to C.  S.  Lewis's little book The Abolition
of Man.  Therein Lewis sets side by side, drawn from various cultures,
illustrations of the Tao, or Natural Law.  He groups these precepts or
injunctions under eight headings:  the law of general beneficence; the
law of special beneficence; duties to parents, elders, ancestors;
duties to children and posterity; the law of justice; the law of good
faith and veracity; the law of mercy; the law of magnanimity. 
Everywhere in the world, in every age, Lewis is saying, wise men and
women have perceived the nature of justice and expressed that nature
in proverb, maxim, and injunction.
<P>
     At this point one may inquire, "Are you implying that just men
and women find in religious doctrines -- Hebraic, Christian, Moslem,
Hindu, Buddhist -- the fountains of justice?"  Yes, I am so reasoning. 
The sanction for justice will be found, ultimately, in religious
insights as to the human condition, and particularly in Revelation. 
Our so-called "Western" concepts of justice are derived from the
Decalogue, Platonic religious philosophy, and the teachings of the
Christ.  Somewhere there must exist an authority for beliefs about
justice; and the authority of merely human, and therefore fallible,
courts of law is insufficient to command popular assent and obedience.
<P>
     It does not follow, however, that all just men and women
recognize the ultimate source of ideas about justice, or appeal to
that ultimate source.  My grandfather never read a line that Saint
Thomas Aquinas wrote, though his understanding of justice accorded
well enough with what Aquinas expresses so convincingly in the Summa. 
To my grandfather the justice-concepts of the Hebraic and classical
and medieval cultures were transmitted through British and American
moral, legal, and literary traditions, and through long custom and
habit within his family and within the small-town American communities
where he had lived.  If pressed as to why he held a certain
understanding of the word "justice" -- indeed, he once compulsorily
engaged in a dialogue on that subject with a rather Nietzschean
desperado intent on persuading my grandfather to open his bank's safe
-- I suppose that Frank Pierce would have replied, "Because good men
always have so believed."  Securus judicat orbis terrarum, bonos non
esse qui se dividunt ab orbe terrarum in quacunque parte terrarum,
Saint Augustine of Hippo instructs us -- "The calm judgment of the
world is that those men cannot be good who, in any part of the world,
cut themselves off from the rest of the world."  The word justice
implies obligation to others, or to an Other.
<P>
     Thus far I have been describing the concept of justice that
prevailed in the Western world down to the closing years of the
eighteenth century.  Behind the phrase "to each his own" lay the
beliefs that divine wisdom has conferred upon man a distinct nature;
that human nature is constant; that the idea of justice is implanted
in the human consciousness by a transcendent power; and that the
general rule by which we endeavor to do justice is this:  "to each
man, the things that are his own."
<P>
     What is meant by this famous phrase?  To put the matter very
succinctly, the doctrine of suum cuique affirms that every man,
minding his own business, should receive the rewards which are
appropriate to his work and duties.  It takes for granted a society of
diversity, with various classes and interests.  It implies both
responsibility toward others and personal freedom.  It has been a
strong protection for private property, on a small scale or a great;
and a reinforcement, for Jews and Christians, of the Tenth
Commandment.  Through the Roman law, this doctrine of justice passed
into the legal codes of the European continent, and even into English
and American law.
<P>
     Injustice, according to this doctrine, occurs when men try to
undertake things for which they are not fitted, and to claim rewards
to which they are not entitled, and to deny to other men what really
belongs to those other men.  As Plato puts it, in The Republic, quite
as an unjust man is a being whose reason, will, and appetite are at
war one with another, so an unjust society is a state afflicted by
"meddlesomeness, and interference, and the rising up of a part of the
soul against the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority, which is
made by a rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he is the
natural vassal -- what is all this confusion and delusion but
injustice, and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance, and every
form of vice?"
<P>
     Edmund Burke re-expressed this doctrine of "to each his own"
when, in his Reflections on the Revolution in France, he wrote of true
natural rights:  "Men have a right to the fruits of their industry,
and to the means of making their industry fruitful.  They have a right
to the acquisitions of their parents, to the nourishment and
improvement of their offspring, to instruction in life, and to
consolation in death.  Whatever each man can separately do, without
trespassing upon others, he has a right to do for himself; and he has
a right to all which society, with all its combinations of skill and
force, can do in his favor."
<P>
     And yet in Burke's own time, there arose a very different idea of
justice, the Utilitarian concept, expounded by Jeremy Bentham.  From
Bentham's jurisprudence there is descended the powerful present-day
school of legal thought that we call legal positivism or legal
realism.  Positivistic jurisprudence arose in alliance with
nineteenth-century nationalism and with scientific mechanism and
materialism.  To the legal positivist or realist, laws are the
commands of human beings merely.  There exists, for the positivist, no
necessary connections between law and morals, or between law as it is
and law as it ought to be.  The positivists' legal system is a closed,
logical system without need for referring to social aims, policies, or
moral standards.  So-called "moral judgments," to the positivists, are
"value judgments" merely:  and value judgments cannot be established
or defended by rational argument.  This positivistic understanding of
justice and law looms large in American courts today.
<P>
     But in this lecture I do not have time to analyze the strengths
and weaknesses of legal positivism.  For the present, I do no more
than to point out that nineteenth- and twentieth-century positivism
stands in harsh opposition to both the classical and the Christian
understanding of justice and law.  In Catholic universities, at least,
some defense still is offered of the Augustinian virtue of justice and
the venerable theory of natural law.
<P>
     It is my purpose in today's remarks to state the classical and
the Christian concept of justice, as opposed to the positivists'
denial of any source for justice except the commands of the sovereign
state.  And I will touch glancingly upon the connections among
religion, justice, and law.  (Justice and law are not identical,
though they may be closely related:  in a good commonwealth, law is an
attempt to maintain standards of justice, so far as that may be
achieved in a bent world.)
<P>
     All law is derived from the religious understanding -- that is,
all law in the traditional societies of the West; law in totalist
states is another matter entirely.  Moses came down from Horeb and did
justice upon criminous Israelites:  the prophet as lawgiver.  Solon
reformed the laws of Draco:  the religious poet as lawgiver.  When law
is divorced from the moral sanction of religious convictions,
presently the law is corrupted by passion, prejudice, private
interest, and misguided sentimentality.
<P>
     The church is concerned with the inner order:  the order of the
soul.  The state is concerned with the outer order:  the order of the
commonwealth.  Between state and church, nevertheless, relationships
are ineluctable.  Among these relationships is an understanding of
justice.
<P>
     Such relationships took shape in the West so early as the fifth
century of the Christian era.  We perceive them in the connections
between Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, and his friend Boniface, Count of
Africa.  In theory, all Christians of the West believe in separation
of church and state -- though sometimes that principle has been more
honored in the breach than in the observance.
<P>
     The church recognizes the necessary end of the state, and so
submits to the state's laws.  Because of human sinfulness, the Fathers
of the Church taught, the state is ordained of God.  As best it can,
the state restrains the three chief forms of lust:  cupidity, the lust
for possessions; the libido dominandi, the lust for power; and sexual
lust, the abuse of the gift of procreation.  When the state is
enfeebled, these lusts work the ruin of the person and the republic.
<P>
     So it is that the church, even in Roman imperial times, has
taught obedience to civil magistrates.  Saint Augustine reasoned that
the good citizen, the believing Christian, should obey every command
of the state, save one:  an order to worship false gods and to serve
Satan.
<P>
     Yet church and state have different ends, though both uphold
justice.  There runs through the history of Christianity the doctrine
of the two swords:  the church's sword of faith, the state's sword of
secular justice.
<P>
     Knowing that this earthly existence is not the be-all and end-
all, the church holds that perfect justice is in the power of God
alone, beyond the confines of time and space.  In this world here
below, we mete out justice as best we may.  Sometimes we err in our
administering of justice; it cannot well be otherwise; we are not
perfect or perfectible creatures.
<P>
     To apprehend the church's stand on mundane justice, it is
desirable to make distinctions between crime and sin.  A crime is an
act or omission which the law punishes on behalf of the state, whether
because that act or omission is expressly forbidden by statute, or
because it is so injurious to the public as to require punishment on
the ground of public policy.
<P>
     A sin is a transgression against moral law, with that law's
divine sanctions.  It is God, not the State, who punishes or forgives
sins.
<P>
     Not all sins are crimes.  We have it on the authority of Saint
Paul that the greatest of the theological virtues is charity. 
Therefore uncharitableness is a great sin; yet lack of charity is not
an offense at law.  A man may be all his life snarling, sneering,
contemptuous, envious, abominable in his language toward his wife, his
children, and others to whom he owes obligations -- that is, perfectly
uncharitable; yet he will run no risk of being haled before the bar of
criminal justice.  The uncharitable may be dealt with at the Last
Judgment.  But mundane courts of law do not touch the sinner unless
his sins result in violence or fraud or substantial damage to others. 
The state is unconcerned with sins unless they lead to breaches of the
peace, or menace the social order.  This separation of function
accords with the doctrine of the two swords.
<P>
     Quite as the state -- that is, the constitutional state -- does
not lay down religious dogmata in recent times, so the church does not
decree the laws of mundane justice, as expressed through courts of
law.  When the church has endeavored to impose its doctrines through
the operation of the state's criminal law, the church has erred.
<P>
     I have been speaking of orthodox Christian doctrine, interwoven
with principles of law in America, Britain, and many other countries
-- interwoven, that is, until recent decades.  But great confusion has
fallen upon us in these years near the end of the century. 
Increasingly, the state -- aye, the democratic state, too -- separates
itself from the religious understanding of the human condition.  And a
good many churchmen abandon Christian realism for a sentimental
humanitarianism.
<P>
     Let me remind you of the true signification of this word
"humanitarianism."  Properly defined -- and this is the definition one
still finds in the Oxford English Dictionary -- humanitarianism is the
doctrine that Jesus of Nazareth possessed a human nature merely, not
being divine; and, by extension, the doctrine that mankind may become
perfect without divine aid.  A humanitarian is a person totally
secularized in his convictions.  Yet erroneously many people use
"humanitarian" as a term of commendation.  "He was a great
humanitarian," they say of Albert Schweitzer.  That charitable and
heroic man, a professing Christian, would have rejected indignantly
that label.
<P>
     Now what has this distinction between humanitarianism and charity
to do with justice?  The point is this:  the humanitarian denies the
existence of sin, declaring that what we call "sins" are not moral
matters at all, resulting instead from circumstance, faulty rearing,
or social oppression.  In the view of the humanitarian, sins -- and
crimes, too -- are the work of "society"; and sinners and criminals
are victims, rather than unjust offenders.  Such reasoning is the
consequence of holding that man and society may be perfected through
mere alteration of social conditions, without the intervention of
divine grace.
<P>
     The humanitarian frequently proclaims his abhorrence of severe
punishments -- perhaps of any punishments.  Why?  First, because of
his illusion that no human being possesses the ability to make moral
choices.  Second, because of his horror of inflicting pain.  He leaves
no ultimate justice to God, because he fancies that no God exists. 
The mere preservation of one's comfortable earthly life is his
obsession, he fancying that man is not made for eternity.
<P>
     On the other hand, the humanitarian fulminates against those who
disagree with his principles.  Thus there occurs the phenomenon called
"the humanitarian with the guillotine."  (The recent French film
called Danton sufficiently illustrates this ferocious love of all
humankind.) As Edmund Burke put it, speaking of the humanitarian
Jacobins, men who today snatch the worst criminals from the hands of
justice tomorrow may approve the slaughter of whole classes. 
Humanitarian apologies in our own time for butchery by communist
revolutionaries sufficiently suggest the persistence of this curious
intolerant humanitarianism.  The ideologue need merely proclaim that
his object is universal happiness here below, and he is approved
uncritically by the humanitarian.  As Solovyev wrote, the banners of
the Anti-Christ will bear the legend, "Feed men, and then ask them of
virtue."
<P>
     In this disordered age, when it seems as if the fountains of the
great deep had been broken up, our urgent need is to restore a general
understanding of the classical and Christian teaching about justice. 
Without just men and women, egoism and appetite bring down a
civilization.  Without strong administration of justice by the state,
we all become so many Cains, every man's hand against every other
man's.  The humanitarian fancies himself zealous for the life impulse;
in reality, he would surrender us to the death impulse.  The
humanitarian's visions issue from between the delusory gates of ivory;
justice issues from between the gates of horn.
<P>
     Public instruction that ignores both our classical patrimony and
our religious patrimony may fail to rear up just men and women. 
Positivist jurisprudence that denies any moral order and any religious
sanction for justice may end in a general flouting of all law.  We
prate of "peace and justice" in a dissolving culture, without
apprehending tolerably the words we employ.  "Shrieking voices/
Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering,/ Always assail them."  These
are the voices of the ideologue, the neurotic, and the nihilist,
pulling down the old understanding of Justice, "to each his own."
<P>
     "Justice is a certain rectitude of mind, whereby a man does what
he ought to do in the circumstances confronting him."  So Thomas
Aquinas instructs us.  At every college and university, the doctors of
the schools ought to inquire of themselves, "Do we impart such
rectitude of mind?  And if we do not, will there be tolerable private
or public order in the twenty-first century?"

<P>

      A few days past, my wife fell into casual conversation with
three medical men.  All three of the doctors were dismayed at the
present situation and future prospects of the American people, and,
unsolicited, expressed at some length their vaticinations.  A surgeon,
after remarking that on the imminent breadlines people would be armed
and fighting, claiming rights but denying duties, then groaned.  "It's
all over!  I thought we had more time!  We lasted only two hundred
years!"
<P>
      This mood of despondency is widespread today.  "Shine, perishing
Republic!"  in the line of Robinson Jeffers.  The parallel with Roman
decay is sufficiently obvious.  As the American economy staggers under
a burden of taxation that soon, we are promised -- under Clinton
Caesar -- will be increased, the federal government sends the Marines
to Somalia to take two million Somalis under our spread-eagle wings. 
It was thus the Romans occupied Greece, for the sake of the wayward
Greeks -- and never left Greece until the Greek cities were ruined in
the collapse of the whole Empire.  Whom the gods wish to destroy, they
first make mad.
<P>
      Yesteryear's great expectations are blasted.  For the first
time, a great many Americans suspect that America's culture is
decadent.  Some of them seem well content with the sickness of our old
culture.  "What do you mean by 'culture?'  the Governor of New York
exclaimed four months ago.  "That's a word they used in Nazi Germany." 
This uncultured and unscrupulous demagogue is mentioned by President-
elect Clinton as a praiseworthy future associate justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States.  When such persons are elevated to
great power in the Republic, indeed there exists reason to raise the
question of social decadence.
<P>
      Defining Culture.  There has appeared a spate of books about the
present "Culture War."  And much obloquy is cast upon the so-called
"cultural elite" of the United States.  Succinctly, how may we define
this "culture" that has grown controversial?  In my newest book,
America's British Culture, published this week by the sociological
firm of Transaction, I examine at length such definitions; but for the
present, let us take a definition by Christopher Dawson, the great
historian of culture, whose works, in twenty-two volumes, I have begun
to edit in a uniform edition, at the request of the Homeland
Foundation.  Here, extracted from Dawson's first book, The Age of the
Gods (1928), is that definition:
<P>
 <UL> A culture is a common way of life -- a particular
      adjustment of man to his natural surroundings and his
      economic needs....  And just as every natural region tends
      to possess its characteristic forms of animal and vegetable
      life, so too will it possess its own type of human
      society....   The higher culture will express itself
      through its material circumstance, as masterfully and
      triumphantly as the artist through the medium of his
      material.</UL>
<P>
      Just so.  Our American culture, derived in large part from
centuries of British culture, has grown in this continent to a
tremendous civilization; President Bush takes pride in the fact that
America is now the only superpower.  Pride goeth before a fall.  That
is why I am conversing with you on the subject of whether this
civilization of ours may endure during the twenty-first century of the
Christian era.  What, if anything, may you and I do to renew this
shaken culture of ours?
<P>
      In my preceding three lectures, I dealt with three menaces to
the survival of our civilization:  first, the fraud called
multiculturalism, which is a device to pull down the inherited culture
of these United States; second, the endeavor of militant secular
humanists to undermine the religious heritage of the American people;
third, the ideology called democratism, the heresy of democracy, which
proclaims that one man is as good as another (or perhaps a little
better), and that the voice of the abstract People is the voice of
God.  Of course these movements or attitudes are not the only reasons
why our civilization appears to be in the sere and yellow leaf, but
they are of fairly recent origin and constitute a clear and present
danger.  How may you and I contend with a tolerable hope against these
forces, thus shoring up the footing of the edifice of the American
common way of life?
<P>
      Well, before we endeavor to prescribe remedies, we need to
ascertain the causes of our difficulties.  We must remind ourselves,
to begin, that culture arises from the cult:  out of the religious
bond and the sense of the sacred grow any civilization's agriculture,
its common defense, its orderly towns, its ingenious architecture, its
literature, its music, its visual arts, its law, its political
structure, its educational apparatus, and its mores.  Christopher
Dawson, Eric Voegelin, and other historians of this century have made
this historical truth clear.
<P>
      Decay of the Cult.  Modern society's gravest afflictions,
conversely, are caused by the decay of the cult upon which a society
has been founded, or by the sharp separation of the trappings of a
sophisticated civilization from the nurturing cult, with its glimpse
of the transcendent.  Alexander Solzhenitsyn, in his Templeton Address
at London, put this plainly enough:
<P>
 <UL> Our life consists not in the pursuit of material success
      but in the quest of worthy spiritual growth.
<P>
      Our entire earthly existence is but a transition stage in
      the movement toward something higher, and we must not
      stumble or fall, nor must we linger fruitlessly on one rung
      of the ladder....   The laws of physics and physiology will
      never reveal the indisputable manner in which The Creator
      constantly, day in and day out, participates in the life of
      each of us, unfailingly granting us the energy of
      existence; when this assistance leaves us, we die.  In the
      life of our entire planet, the Divine Spirit moves with no
      less force; this we must grasp in our dark and terrible
      hour.</UL>
<P>
      Thus it should be understood that the ideology of secular
humanism, the ideology of democratism, and the ideology of negritude
that lies behind professed "multiculturalism," all are assaults upon a
common way of life that has developed out of Christian insights -- or,
if you will, Judeo-Christian insights -- into the human condition. 
Ideology always is the enemy of religion, and endeavors to supplant
its adversary among humankind.  But ideology has been unable to
produce a counter-culture that endures long -- witness the collapse of
the Soviet Union after seven decades of power.
<P>
      The relationship between religious faith and a high culture,
described here by Solzhenitsyn, has been denied or ignored by the
intellectuals, although not forgotten by the humble.  At the beginning
of his Templeton Address, Solzhenitsyn made that point.  "Over half a
century ago, while I was still a child," Solzhenitsyn said, "I recall
hearing a number of older people offer the following explanation for
the great disasters that had befallen Russia. ' Men have forgotten
God; that's why all this has happened.'"  They were right, and so are
their counterparts in the United States today.
<P>
      About eight years ago, the Brookings Institution published a
careful study by James Reichley, entitled Religion in American Public
Life.  In a chapter entitled "Religion, Politics, and Human Values,"
Mr.  Reichley examined eight value-systems, and found only one of
those sufficient to balance individual rights against social
authority, so bringing about harmony in a culture.  That one value-
system he called "theist-humanism":  most people recognize it as
Christianity, in Reichley's description.  It is only a renewed sense
of the sacred, I am suggesting -- by a return to Christian
understanding of the human condition and its limitations, I am
suggesting, that the American nation may withstand the designs of
ideology and restore those common ways of life that we call America's
culture.
<P>
                         

      The governor of Mississippi has been reproached for declaring
that America is a Christian nation.  Despite objections, he was quite
right; his opponents seem not to understand the meaning of the word
"nation," except as it is incorrectly employed by the daily
journalist.  True, the United States of America is not a Christian
state, for the country's Constitution forbids the establishment of a
national church by Congress, and stands tolerant of all religions. 
But the words state and nation signify different concepts.  "State"
means the governmental organization of a country, political society
with sovereign power; while "nation" means the people of the land,
with their culture -- and not merely the people who are living just
now, but also their ancestors and those who will descend from them: 
that is, a nation is extended in time and shares a culture:  those
participants in a common culture who are living today, and the
participants in that culture who have preceded them in time, and those
participants in the common culture who are yet to be born.  One might
call a nation a community of souls.
<P>
      In that proper understanding of what a nation amounts to, the
American nation is Christian, although more Christian formerly,
perhaps, than it is just now.  For Christianity, if sometimes in a
diluted form, is the religion of the majority of Americans nowadays;
and beyond church communicants, there are millions of Americans who do
not attend churches, but nevertheless are strongly influenced by
Christian morals; moreover nearly else who has lived long in the
United States, though he be Jew or Moslem or agnostic, conforms in
large degree to American folkways and customs and conventions that are
Christian in origin:  in short, the American culture, with its
Christian roots, is everywhere dominant in these United States, among
the larger "minorities" of the population as well as among Americans
of European descent; that is, the Christian ethos is no less strong
among blacks and persons of Latin-American descent than among
Americans who can trace their descent in this country back to the
seventeenth century.
<P>
      So the Governor of Mississippi is quite right:  America is a
Christian nation; this is a matter of fact, not of opinion.  Whether
America will remain a Christian nation is matter for argument,
perhaps:  the creation of special rights for pathics, for instance,
indicates that Christian morals are going by the board; and the
prevalence of abortion, the deliberate destruction of one's offspring,
is another suggestion that both Christian belief and Christian morals
have begun to succumb to total religious indifference, if not yet to
atheism.  But if Christian faith and morals will be generally rejected
by the coming of the twenty-first century, then probably the whole
culture will disintegrate, the material culture as well as the
intellectual and moral culture; and human existence here will become
poor, nasty, brutish, and short:  unless some quite new culture, which
as yet nobody can imagine, should rise up.  Any such unnameable
innovative culture, to endure, would require some transcendent
sanction, perhaps some theophanic event -- something more enduring
than mere Marxist ideology, which was a violent attempt at a new faith
and a new culture.
<P>
      Why have an increasing number of Americans endeavored to break
with our inherited culture and its religious roots?  The reasons are
diverse; but the fundamental impulse to reject a religious patrimony
is expressed by T.  S.  Eliot in his choruses for "The Rock,"
especially in the following lines:
<P>
 <UL> Why should men love the Church?  Why should they love her laws?<BR>
      She tells them of Life and Death, and of all that they would
         forget.<BR>
      She is tender where they would be hard, and hard where they like
         to be soft.<BR>
      She tells them of Evil and Sin, and other unpleasant facts.<BR>
      They constantly try to escape<BR>
      From the darkness outside and within<BR>
      By dreaming of systems so perfect that no one will need to be
         good.</UL>
<P>
      Religion restrains the passions and the appetites:  and sensate
natures flout restraints.  The more perverse the pleasure, the more it
is sought by some.  So it is that public funds have been employed
recently to subsidize obscene representations of Jesus of Nazareth;
this seems to some titillatingly smart.  I find it odd that, so far as
I know, nobody has compared these "works of art" to the obscene
representations of Jews in which Joseph Goebbels and his colleagues
rejoiced during the regime of Hitler. 
<P>
      Religious Renewal. I have been suggesting, ladies and gentlemen,
that for our culture -- our inherited ways of life that have nurtured
our American society in the past -- to be reinvigorated, a renewal of
religious faith is required.  So long as many of us deny the dignity
of man and indulge what T.  S.  Eliot called "the diabolic
imagination," our culture limps downward.  Our public schools, almost
totally secularized, starve the religious imagination; federal and
state courts often tend to frown upon Christian morals and churches'
claims to independence.  Will a time arrive when religion is indulged
by public authorities only on sufferance?
<P>
      What can be done to restore the religious imagination within our
common culture?  One cannot look to many seminaries for such a
vigorous work of renewal:  most of those institutions are pursuing
theological or quasi-theological novelties, and are caught up in the
humanitarian spirit of the age.  No one can sincerely embrace a
religious creed merely because it might be socially beneficial to do
so.  Conceivably some great preacher or great novelist or great poet
may move minds and hearts toward the transcendent again, opening eyes
that had been sealed; there come to mind the examples of John Wesley
in eighteenth-century England, Chateaubriand in France at the end of
the French Revolution, T.  S.  Eliot in this century.  Or possibly men
of the natural sciences may come to perceive design in the universe,
purpose in mutations.  Or, as in ages past, we may be given a Sign.
<P>
      Some people, after the fashion of T.  S.  Eliot, may turn toward
Christianity once they have discovered how unendurable a place the
twentieth-century world would become were that faith altogether
lacking.  Others, myself among them, may come from much reading and
meditation to conclude that Augustine of Hippo and Sir Thomas Browne
and Samuel Johnson and Samuel Taylor Coleridge and John Henry Newman,
professed Christians and apologists too, were no fools.  Whether
enough such persons may take up the cause of Christian teaching to
alter the spirit of the age -- why, who can tell?  C.S.  Lewis and
Malcolm Muggeridge succeeded in moving intellects and consciences, and
a half-dozen American writers continue to do so among us today.  By
the way, I particularly commend to you, ladies and gentlemen, a new
book by William Kirk Kilpatrick, Why Johnny Can't Tell Right from
Wrong:  Moral Illiteracy and the Case for Character Education.  Say
not the struggle naught availeth:  this earnest book very effectively
exposes the mischief being done by those educators who in Britain are
called "the crazies."  At one American gathering of that educationist
clan, hard haters of old moral principles, all the major religions of
the world were dismissed as "male chauvinist murder cults."

<P>

      Short of a mighty reinvigoration of the religious imagination,
what may you and I do to redeem the time?
<P>
      Confining ourselves to the three causes of cultural decadence
that I discussed in my three previous lectures, I declare that we can
do much, in a practical way.
<P>
      With respect to multiculturalism, it is entirely possible to
resist this silly, malign movement, despite its temporary successes,
and to begin to restore a decent curriculum to schools, colleges, and
universities; if we succeed, nine-tenths of the students will bless
us.  At the University of Texas, recently, the multicultural program
was opposed by a majority of the faculty in a secret ballot; and the
university's president resigned in consequence, praise be.  A little
more courage on the part of college administrators and professors
would undo this anti-cultural tyranny.  And yet the advantages still
lies with the aggressors.  At one Michigan college, this year, black
militant students engaged in wild demonstrations.  Far from
disciplining the student offenders, the woman president of the college
ordered two or three members of the faculty to undergo sensitivity
training, so that they would learn to be sufficiently servile to
militant students.  A mad world, my masters!  Let us prod some
university presidents and trustees into defense of true academic
freedom.
<P>
      With respect to the assaults upon religious belief, which has
been the source of all high culture over the ages, it is high time for
us to oppose most strenuously those governmental policies which
discriminate against religion and received morality.  In New York
City, very recently, Dr.  Russell Hittinger, a redoubtable learned
champion of the doctrines of natural law, issued from the platform a
virtual call to arms against the enemies of moral order -- some of
them entrenched behind the federal bench.  Let us remember that not
even the Supreme Court of the United States is endowed with arbitrary
and absolute power:  Congress, if it so chooses may remove from the
Court's appellate jurisdiction certain categories of cases, and in
other ways may remind the judiciary that it is not a constitutional
archonocracy.  But I leave to your ingenuity, ladies and gentlemen,
the devising of ways to resist and even to intimidate those zealots
for the abolition of all restraint upon sensual impulse.
<P>
      In connection with this possible restoration of the religious
imagination, it is of the first importance to bring about more choice
in education at every level -- so that those parents and others who
would have their children obtain religious knowledge may be enabled to
do so.  The national administration of President Bush gave at least
lip-service to this cause:  and more than ever before, there exists a
possibility of persuading state legislators to pass such measures. 
<P>
      Third, I urge you friends, to resist manfully and womanfully the
thoughtless centralization of political and economic power.  Not
content with having reduced the several American states, nominally
sovereign, to impotent provinces, America's centralizers, with their
dream of a New World Order, have commenced to acquire provinces
overseas -- Somalia the first in this decade, perhaps.  "Take up the
white man's burden," certain liberal voices exhort us.  One can
imagine the nightmare of a universal domination of egalitarian
"democratic capitalism" directed by the Washington bureaucracy --
unimaginative, arrogant, everywhere resented in the twenty-first
century -- draining America's resources and energies as Rome was
drained by her empire.  The more centralization, the less freedom and
the less energy.
<P>
      Is this the manifest destiny of the United States to become the
New Rome?  Have you and I no choice about that?  Nay, not so.  In
1795, a dread year for Britain, old Edmund Burke, in his first Letter
on a Regicide Peace, denied that great states have to obey some
irresistible law of progress or decay; Burke set his face against the
attitude now called "determinism."  Permit me to quote a key passage:
<P>
 <UL> It is often impossible, in these political inquiries, to
      find any proportion between the apparent causes we may
      assign, and their known operation.  We are therefore
      obliged to deliver up that operation to mere chance; or,
      more piously (perhaps more rationally), to the occasional
      interposition and the irresistible hand of the Great
      Disposer.  We have seen states of considerable duration,
      for which ages have remained nearly as they have begun, and
      could hardly be said to ebb or flow.  The meridian of some
      has been most splendid.  Others, and they the greatest
      number, have fluctuated, and experienced at different
      periods of their existence a great variety of fortune.  At
      the very moment when some of them seem plunged in
      unfathomable abysses of disgrace and disaster, they have
      begun a new course, and opened a new reckoning, and even in
      the depths of their calamity, and on the very ruins of
      their country, have laid the foundations of a towering and
      durable greatness.  All this happened without any apparent
      previous change in the general circumstances which had
      brought on their distress.  The death of a man at a
      critical juncture, his retreat, have brought innumerable
      calamities on a whole nation.  A common soldier, a child, a
      girl at the door of an inn, have changed the face of
      fortune, and almost of Nature.</UL>
<P>
      In those two sentences, Burke may refer to the reverses of
Pericles, to the death of the Constable of Bourbon and other startling
historical instances of a country's fate hanging upon a single life. 
His common soldier is Arnold of Winkelreid, who flung himself upon the
Austrian lances at Sempach; his child is Hannibal, taking at the age
of twelve his oath to make undying war upon Rome; his girl at the inn
is Joan of Arc.  Providence, chance, or strong wills, Burke declares,
abruptly may alter the whole apparent direction of "that armed ghost,
the meaning of history" (Gabriel Marcel's phrase).
<P>
      Even such as you and I, my friends, if we are resolute enough
and sufficiently imaginative, may alter the present course of events. 
God, we have been told, helps those who help themselves.  In the face
of increasing tribulations, sometimes conservatives and liberals are
making common cause in the defense of America's culture.  Both Arthur
M.  Schlesinger, Jr., and your servant have written books in
repudiation of multiculturalism.  Once more, say not the struggle
naught availeth.  A great number of the American people already have
taken alarm at the drift of policy and morality in this land. 
Reactions may be salutary:  as the poet Roy Campbell used to say, a
human body that cannot react is a corpse; and so it is with society. 
Up the reactionaries against decadence!
<P>
      Permit me, in conclusion, to quote a heartening passage from a
book, Our Present Discontents, published in 1919, a year in some
respects like the year 1992.  The author was William Ralph Inge, then
Dean of St.  Paul's in London, commonly described by journalists as
"the Gloomy Dean."  The passage I offer you, however, is one of hope:
<P>
       <UL> There may be in progress a store of beneficent forces
      which we cannot see, There are ages of sowing and ages of
      reaping; the brilliant epochs may be those in which
      spiritual wealth is squandered; the epochs of apparent
      decline may be those in which the race is recuperating
      after an exhausting effort.  To all appearances, man still
      has a great part of his long lease before him, and there is
      no reason to suppose that the future will be less
      productive of moral and spiritual triumphs than the past. 
      The source of all good is like an inexhaustible river; the
      Creator pours forth new treasures of goodness, truth, and
      beauty for all who will love them and take them, "Nothing
      that truly is can ever perish," as Plotinus says; whatever
      has value in God's sight is for evermore.  Our half-real
      world is the factory of souls in which we are tried as in a
      furnace.  We are not to set our hopes upon it, but learn
      such wisdom as it can teach us while we pass through it.</UL>
<P>
       America has overcome the ideological culture of the Union of
Socialist Soviet Republics.  In the decade of this victory, are
Americans to forswear the beneficent culture that they have inherited? 
For a civilization to arise and flower, centuries are required; but
the indifference or the hostility of a single generation may suffice
to work that civilization's ruin.  We must confront the folk whom
Arnold Toynbee called "the internal proletariat" as contrasted with
the "external proletariat" from alien lands.  Otherwise we may end,
all of us, as fellow-proletarians, culturally deprived, in a nation
that will permit no one to rise above mediocrity.

      This year my Heritage lectures have been concerned with American
political errors during the closing decade of the twentieth century --
errors of the Republican party, of the Democratic party, and general
blunders in foreign relations. This evening, ladies and gentlemen, I
conclude my lecture series for Anno Domini 1991 with some desultory
remarks on the possibility of redemption from error -- and, in
particular, whether our rising generation in these United States may
find it possible to "redeem the time, redeem the dream" -- to borrow
T.S. Eliot's line.
<P>
      First, a few words about this concept "generation." To generate
is to beget; to bring into existence. In popular usage we mean by a
generation a large number of persons brought into existence about the
same time; in the same year, perhaps, or possibly in the same decade.
Thomas Jefferson promulgated the somewhat vague concept of every
"generation" of people making its own choices; of the generation of
the living not binding the generation which soon would come into
existence.
<P>
      Yet, this notion cannot be sustained logically or pragmatically.
For really there exists no line of demarcation parting alleged
generations of men and women. Every minute, as I address you, babies
are being born somewhere; and during the same minutes, old people are
dying in every land. 
<P>
      Actually, society is an intricate continuity of lives, not a
mere succession of human beings resembling the flies of a summer,
generation unable to link with generation. It is possible for me to
say truthfully that six generations of my family have lived in our
house at the village of Mecosta, in Michigan; but those alleged
"generations" have much overlapped; at no time over the past twelve
decades has only a single generation lived in our family home. The
notion of distinct generations, then, each generation monopolizing the
earth during its brief span of existence, is merely a convenient
fiction.
<P>
      Nevertheless, we employ that useful fiction frequently,
particularly with reference to literary and political movements. Thus
Spaniards refer to the "Generation of '98," made up of literary movers
and shakers whose convictions were formed at the time of Spain's naval
and military defeats that caused the loss of the Philippines, Cuba,
and Puerto Rico. Thus, in Britain, Wyndham Lewis referred to the "men
of 1914" -- certain innovating writers who began to appear in print
about the beginning of the First World War: Eliot, James Joyce, Ezra
Pound, T.E. Hulme, and Lewis himself. And thus, a very few years ago,
here at The Heritage Foundation, Mr. Ben Hart introduced the concept
of three generations of American conservatives that have exercised
influence since the late 1940s, say. Tonight, I address especially the
third of those hypothetical generations.
<P>
      By the First Generation, I take it, Mr. Hart means men and women
of politics and letters who began to come to public attention about
the end of the 'Forties and the beginning of the 'Fifties; who, most
of them, had grown aware of the sunken state of the world about them,
some time between, or during, the First World War and the Great
Depression. Among such persons who grew up with a conservative
inclination were Richard Weaver, Francis Wilson, Robert Nisbet, Daniel
Boorstin, William Buckley, and your servant; one might add William
Yandell Elliott (a little older) and William McGovern, and others who
were active so early as 1933, say. There would be regarded as
belonging to an earlier "generation," both in point of years and of
thought, such persons as T.S. Eliot, Irving Babbitt, Paul Elmer More,
and George Santayana. Among public men, Senators Robert A. Taft and
Carl Curtis, say, would be classified as members of the pre-
conservative generation, I suppose, their activity having occurred
mostly during the presidencies of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman;
while Senator Barry Goldwater, a relatively late conservative champion
in arms, would be classed with the First Generation conservatives, I
suppose, in Mr. Hart's scheme. You will perceive, ladies and
gentlemen, that membership in a hypothetical generation does not
necessarily coincide with the date of one's nativity.
<P>
      The Second Generation of conservatives, in Mr. Hart's
categories, consists of persons of varying ages who were attracted to
conservative causes, or began to style themselves conservatives,
sometime after 1953, in which year The Conservative Mind was
published. Thus Mr. Irving Kristol, almost so old as is your servant,
is classified as Second Generation; so is my wife Annette Yvonne
Cecilie Courtmanche Kirk, the first secretary at the organizational
meeting of Young Americans for Freedom, twenty-one years younger than
myself. I take it that Dr. Jeffrey Hart, Mr. Ben Hart's father, is
Second Generation -- although very nearly meeting the requirements for
Generation I; that Mr. M. Stanton Evans, despite his many years of
active duty in the conservative array, is a Second Generation
legionnaire; while Mr. Ben Hart himself, and his spouse are field
marshals of the Third Generation. 
<P>
      But, more subtle distinctions and classifications I leave to Mr.
Gregory Wolfe, now engaged in preparing an Encyclopedia of the Right.
So far as public men go, permit me to suggest merely that such
conservatively-inclined gentlemen as Senator Richard Lugar, Governor
John Engler, and Mr. Patrick Buchanan seem to fall within the Second
Generation fold. In brief, nowadays First Generation conservatives --
such of them as have not passed unto a less troubled realm of being --
usually are people in their seventies or their sixties; Second
Generation conservatives, most of them, in their fifties or forties;
Third Generation conservatives, in their thirties or their twenties --
or even in their teens. Pass we then to these ladies and gentlemen of
the Third Generations.

<P>

      Few of the Third Generation folk retain personal memories of the
Disaster of 1964 -- that is, the defeat of Barry Goldwater's
presidential candidacy, the centralizing follies of President
Johnson's "Great Society," the foretaste of ruin in Vietnam, the
loathsome and destructive antics of the crazy black militants and the
crazier young white radicals. The present members of the Third
Generation were reared when the hearts of our great American cities
already were dismal and rotten; when addiction to narcotics plagued
every social class; when public schools, with few honorable
exceptions, offered next to nothing for mind and conscience; when
Demon TV offered something for every taste but good taste; when
promiscuity and sexual perversity demanded recognition as normality;
when it was unwise to walk the streets o'nights; when shrieking mobs
dominated what had been the grove and halls of Academe; when
altercations in Washington made it almost impossible to conduct the
regular business of government; when American life seemed confusion
worse confounded; when one came to appreciate the mordant aphorism of
Albert Jay Nock: "American society is like German beer; dregs at the
bottom, scum at the top."
<P>
      In short, the conservative Third Generation have not known a
tranquil and pleasant and confident America. They scarcely can imagine
a time, not many decades past, when it was the happy evening diversion
of families or couples to stroll in New York's Central Park of
Detroit's Belle Isle Park. They have little knowledge even of the
neighborhood grocery or butcher-shop, the corner drug-store with its
soda-fountain; for them is the leviathan shopping-mall, commercial
collectivism. They have experienced little of continuity; the
expectation of change has been greater far. Yet, they know that much
remains to conserve, and that much ought to be restored.
<P>
      In one respect, but in that respect only, the task of the
conservative of 1991 looms less oppressive than was the task of the
conservative of 1951, when my first book was published. I mean that
the grim menace of the Soviet Union no longer hangs over us. Seventy
years were required for the Communist ideology to work its own ruin,
so that it fell to pieces at a good-natured push, quite bloodless,
from Mr. Ronald Reagan. Always will there be wars and rumors of war;
yet from the Soviet terror we have been saved, so that the Third
Generation conservatives may address their energies to something more
fundamental than resisting the armed doctrine called Marxism.
<P>
      What, then, is the mission of Third Generation conservatives,
young men and women who seek to preserve the Permanent Things, those
elements in human existence that were not born yesterday? It is not to
promulgate a "conservative ideology": for conservatism is the negation
of ideology. Ideology is an attempt to govern all life by political
slogans; while American conservatives believe that no mere political
formulas can make a people content. Conservatives take for their guide
in politics what Edmund Burke called "the wisdom of the species": that
is, the experience of human beings in community, extending over many
centuries. Thus, American conservatism is a cast of mind and
character, not a neat body of political abstractions. Ideology is
political fanaticism, an endeavor to rule the world by rigorous
abstract dogmata. The dogmata of an abstract "democratic capitalism"
may be mischievous as the dogmata of Marx.
<P>
      It is possible to describe certain attitudes that make up
America's conservative mentality, even though not all Americans could
express coherently their belief in such general principles, and
although some conservatives would dissent from one or more of the
general assumptions or principles I now mention.
<P>
      First, belief in some transcendent order in the universe, some
law that is more than human: a religious understanding of the human
condition, if you will; a belief in enduring moral norms. As the
national pledge of allegiance puts it, "One nation under God.... "
<P>
      Second, opposition to totalist ideology and the totalist
political order. The American conservative rejects the notion of a
future earthly paradise -- which the ideologue promises to attain.
<P>
      Third, confidence in the American Constitution -- both the
written national Constitution and the intricate fabric of custom,
belief, and habit that makes up the underlying "unwritten"
constitution of a nation-state. Many decisions of the Supreme Court in
recent decades are bitterly resented; nevertheless, attachment to the
Constitution itself remains strong.
<P>
      Fourth, maintenance of the rights of private property and of a
free or competitive economy, as contrasted with a directed or
socialist economy. This healthy prejudice persists despite the
increasing consolidation of business and industry into large
conglomerations or oligopolies.
<P>
      Fifth, suspicion of central political direction, and preference
for state and local powers: insistence upon private rights. 
<P>
      Sixth, a deep-rooted patriotism, joined to uneasiness at
"entangling alliances"; this latter attitude, nevertheless, modified
by determination to resist totalist powers that menace the American
national interest.
<P>
      Seventh, an awareness that change is not identical with healthy
improvement; a relish for the American past; a genuine preference for
the old and tried.
<P>
      Such is the consensus of that very large body of Americans who
choose to call themselves conservative in their politics. Within this
crowd of conservative citizens exist various factions, each
emphasizing some aspect or another of the general conservative
attitude. There exists no "party line" to which conservatives of one
persuasion or another are compelled to conform.
<P>
      Retrenchment and Reform. With such assumptions as those I
outlined just now, America enters upon an age of retrenchment and
reform in economic concerns. If American prosperity is to endure,
public expenditure and taxation must be kept in check. Conservative
economic measures must be employed to prevent inflation of the
currency and to reduce the national deficit -- a hard necessity of
which the general public is becoming aware.
<P>
      In this present era when the Soviet power fades away, the
majority of the American public seem disillusioned with social
experiments and with the rapid pace of change; with excessive
governmental regulation; with cities fallen to ruin and tormented by
crime; with subsidized abortion, with judicial usurping of power, with
a permissive indulgence of license and criminality, with the blight of
pornography, with the whole liberal climate of opinion. For the next
half-century at least, I suggest, the American democracy will tend to
reject those politicians who still indulge dreams of Lotos-land.
Liberalism has undone itself.
<P>
      There have been ages when custom and inertia have lain
insufferably upon humankind; and such an age may come to pass again;
but such is not our age. Ours is an era when the moral and social
heritage of many centuries of civilization stands in imminent peril
from the forces of vertiginous indiscriminate change. Resistance to
the folly of such change is the primary duty of the Third Generation
conservative.
<P>
      The continuing American conservative movement, if it is to be
carried on tolerably well, must work within the minds and the
consciences of a good many young men and women. I do not think that
this work of conservation can be accomplished by any particular group;
certainly not by any idealizing of "business rule." I trust that
Americans will conserve a market economy and all the better features
of an economy marked by volition. But Americans will conserve such
advantages only if they conserve something higher and older: that is,
a society of tradition, diversity, and the life of spirit.

<P>

      The critic Eliseo Vivas wrote once that "It is one of the marks
of human decency to be ashamed of having been born into the twentieth
century." Spiritually and politically, the twentieth century has been
a time of decadence. Yet, as that century draws near to its close, we
may remind ourselves that ages of decadence often have been followed
by ages of renewal.
<P>
      What can you do to commence redeeming the time, to conserve the
Permanent Things, to raise up the human condition to a level less
unworthy of what Pico della Mirandola called "the dignity of man"?
Why, begin by brightening the corner where you are; by improving one
human unit, yourself, and helping your neighbor.
<P>
      You will not need to be rich or famous to take your part in
redeeming the time: what you need for that task is moral imagination
joined to right reason. It is not by wealth or fame that you will be
rewarded, probably, but by eternal moments: those moments of one's
existence in which, as T.S. Eliot put it, time and the timeless
intersect. In such moments, you may discover the answer to that
immemorial question which now and again enters the head of any
reflective man or woman, "What is all this? What is this world that
surrounds us, and why are we here?"
<P>
      Yes, what is all this? Why, this present realm of being, in
which your consciousness and my consciousness are aware of reality, is
a divine creation; and you and I are put into it as into a testing-
ground -- into an arena, if you will. As the German writer Stefan
Andres put it, "We are God's Utopia." You and I are moral beings meant
to accomplish something good, in a small way or a big, in this
temporal world.
<P>
      The Roman Stoics taught that some things in life are good, and
some are evil; but that the great majority of life's happenings are
neither good nor evil, but indifferent merely. Wealth is a thing
indifferent, and so is poverty; fame is a thing indifferent, and so is
obscurity. Shrug your shoulders at things indifferent; set your face
against the things evil; and by doing God's will, said the Stoics,
find that peace which passes all understanding.
<P>
      True Authority. How do we know such postulates, religious and
philosophical, to be true? Why, by the common sense and ancient assent
of mankind -- that is, by hearkening to the voice of true authority,
the voice of what G.K. Chesterton called "the democracy of the dead."
I think of what John Henry Newman wrote about Authority in 1846:
"Conscience is an authority; the Bible is an authority; such is the
Church; such is antiquity; such are the words of the wise; such are
hereditary lessons; such are ethical truths; such are historical
memories; such are legal saws and state maxims; such are proverbs;
such are sentiments, presages, and prepossessions." Believe what wise
men and women, over the centuries, have believed in matters of faith
and morals, and you will have a firm footing on which to stand while
the winds of doctrine howl about you.
<P>
      This counsel that I offer you, conservatives of the Third
Generation, will not guarantee your winning any of the glittering
prizes of modern society; for those too are among the things
indifferent, and some of them are among the things evil. Yet, this
advice from a conservative of the First Generation who has seen a good
deal of the world conceivably may help you on the track toward certain
eternal moments, when time and the timeless intersect. What happens at
such timeless moments, such occurrences in eternity? Why, quiet
perfect events, usually; among them the act of telling stories to
one's children, or of reading aloud to them.
<P>
      What is all this -- this confused American world of glittering
material things and of appalling personal and social decay? I have
found it to be a real world, sun-lit despite its vices; a real world
in which one may develop and exercise one's potential virtues of
courage, prudence, temperance, and justice; one's faith, hope, and
charity. You will take your tumbles in this world, which can be rough
enough in our age, Lord knows; but also you may enjoy your triumphs.
It is a world in which there is so much needing to be done that nobody
ought to be bored. For young Americans especially, this is still a
world of high opportunity.
<P>
      All this creation about us is the garden that we erring humans
were appointed to tend. Plant some flowers in it, if you can, and pull
some weeds. If need be, draw your sword to defend it. Do not fancy
that a sorry policy of Looking Out for Number One will lead you to
Heaven's gate. Do not fail to remind yourselves that consciousness is
a perpetual adventure. Do not ignore the wisdom of the ages, the
democracy of the dead. Such, ladies and gentlemen, is the counsel of
this survivor from the First Generation.
<P>
      Those of us who aspire to conserve our inherited order and
justice and freedom, our patrimony of wisdom and beauty and loving-
kindness, have a hard row to hoe nowadays -- that I confess. But, I am
heartened from time to time by a stanza from Chesterton's long poem,
The Ballad of the White Horse. Chesterton is describing the prophets
of doom, who tell us that nothing in life is permanent; that all is
lost, or is being lost, in our culture; that we totter on the brink of
an abyss. Such prophets of doom think themselves wise. Chesterton has
in mind the typical intellectuals of the twentieth century, but he
calls them the wise men of the East. Here I give you Chesterton's
lines: 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> The wise men know what wicked thingsAre written on the
      sky,They trim sad lamps, they touch sad stringsHearing the
      heavy purple wings,Where the forgotten seraph kingsStill
      plot how God shall die.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Such despairing souls, though possessed perhaps of much
intelligence, in truth are not wise. In our time, ladies and
gentlemen, many voices have been declaring that life is not worth
living. A multitude of writers and professors and publicists and
members of the class of persons commonly styled "intellectuals"
gloomily instruct us that we human beings are no better than naked
apes, and that consciousness is an illusion. Such persons insist that
life has no purpose but sensual gratification; that the brief span of
one's physical existence is the be-all and end-all. Such twentieth-
century sophists have created in the murky caves of the intellect an
Underworld; and they endeavor to convince us all that there exists no
sun -- that the world of wonder and of hope exists nowhere, and never
did exist. Plato knew just such sophists in his age. Those doctrines
of despair, the rising generation of conservatives must confront and
refute.

<P>
      My counsels so far may have seemed somewhat ghostly, no doubt.
But, I have learned from life in various regions of the world, and
under differing circumstances, that it is the life of spirit which
truly matters; and that the Permanent Thing most worthy of
preservation is an understanding of the human soul. The conscious
conservative defends the soul of humankind against the corrosive
materialism and sensuality of twentieth-century will and appetite.
<P>
      Let me turn, however, to the art of worldly wisdom. I can offer,
too, some practical advice. How, for instance, you may ask me, does
one contrive to forge ahead in practical political life in this
sprawling American democracy, with the intention of conducting a
conservative defense of the Permanent Things?
<P>
      Why, ordinarily it is fairly simple to make one's way in the
American political structure. American political parties could not
function without volunteers. Volunteer, and you will be gladly
accepted, such as you being urgently needed; you will find, indeed,
that a number of your fellow-volunteers are rather peculiar people,
almost Outcasts of Poker Flat, but welcome in a local political
organization (if not welcome in many other circles) because, whatever
their peculiarities, they are willing to work for the common cause.
<P> 
      If you are an intelligent and adept volunteer, you will be made
much of by the party leaders and faithful, and will be advanced in
your responsibilities. You may be asked to be a delegate, whether
elected or appointed. If chosen delegate, arrive early at caucus or
convention. When the meeting proper commences, endeavor to sit at the
chairman's right hand; then others may take you for his right-hand
man. There are many little arts by which one may gain ascendancy over
the minds of one's political colleagues. But, the great necessity is
to have acquired previously a fund of knowledge and some mastery of
rhetoric -- and honest principles. That is why I sometimes advise
undergraduates not to expend their time in street demonstrations, but
instead to study. If Karl Marx, instead of reading books within, had
spent his days parading round and round the outside of the British
museum, a placard "Down with the bourgeois!" tacked to a sandwich-
board over his shoulders -- why, had he been so foolish, the world
would be so much better off today.
<P>
      Redeem the time, redeem the dream -- in ways mundane as well as
ways spiritual. If you should resolve really to take a vigorous part
in restoring the American Republic, choose your vocation accordingly,
so that the work by which you gain your livelihood, and the work by
which you help to redeem the time, may coincide. Take to the law -- if
you can endure the boredom of our law schools nowadays. Or, take to
serious journalism -- or, for broader and more immediate influence, to
television and radio. You may accomplish some reform of the American
mind through book-publishing. Or, supposing you possess fortitude
sufficient to fight your way through our PC graduate schools, aspire
after a college professorship that might enable you to counteract the
freaks who appear to dominate the typical campus nowadays. Or take to
pedagogy, if you can surmount the dull obstacles to certification as a
teacher. If you feel a religious calling -- why, in no way might you
accomplish more to restore meaning to lives in the twenty-first
century. And, the best way to insure a Fourth Generation of
intelligent young conservatives is to beget children, and rear them
well: the wise parent is the conservator of ancient truths. As Edmund
Burke put it, "We learn to love the little platoon we belong to in
society." The institution most essential to conserve is the family.
<P>
      If we aspire to redeem this age of ours, so far gone in
decadence -- well, we have no time to lose before commencing our
endeavors. Fixed to the walls of the entrance hall of my house are
masks of the archaic god Cronos, in his role of Time the Devourer; his
half-leonine, half-human face bares his fangs, which the ancient
Greeks dreaded. Those masks serve to remind me daily that the night
cometh when no man shall work, and that I had best turn back to my
productive typewriter.
<P>
      Yet, Time is not a devourer only. With proper use of the life-
span that is allotted to us, we may accomplish our part in redeeming
our era from its vices, terrors, and catastrophic errors. With
Demosthenes, ladies and gentlemen, I beg of you to think. For only if
you think soundly at this juncture in your lives will you be enabled
to act decisively in those years when you have achieved some
influence.
<P>
      I conclude with an exhortation which Orestes Brownson, that
redoubtable conservative reformer, scholar, and journalist, delivered
at Dartmouth College in 1843. His topic was "The Scholar's Mission."
He concluded, as follows, his charge to the rising generation:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Ask not what your age wants, but what it needs, not what it
      will reward, but what, without which, it cannot be saved;
      and that go and do; and find your reward in the
      consciousness of having done your duty, and above all in
      the reflection, that you have been accounted to suffer
      somewhat for mankind.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      In the later 'Sixties, many of the rising generation thought it
amusing to pull down what earlier generations had patiently built up;
their zeal extended even to the burning of university libraries. In
the early 'Nineties, I hope and trust, many of the rising generation
will find it satisfying to restore and redeem their patrimony from
earlier times -- and so save the world from suicide. That labor will
require cleverness and courage. Some of you present here tonight may
choose it for your vocation.

      In commencing this second lecture on the sorry state of
political parties in these United States, I ask you to indulge me in
quoting a passage from Edmund Burke's Thoughts on the Present
Discontents, a political tract, published in 1770, mordantly critical
of the ways of George III with Parliament.  In this famous essay Burke
defines the phrase "political party":
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they
      will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a
      contemptible struggle.... 
<P>
      Party is a body of men united for promoting by their joint
      endeavors the national interest upon some particular
      principle in which they are all agreed.  For my part, I
      find it impossible to conceive that anyone believes in his
      own politics, or thinks them of any weight, who refuses to
      adopt the means of having them reduced into practice.  It
      is the business of the speculative philosopher to mark the
      proper ends of government.  It is the business of the
      politician, who is the philosopher in action, to find out
      proper means towards those ends, and to employ them with
      effect.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Now I confess myself to be one of those speculative
philosophers, mentioned by Burke, whose business it is to mark the
proper ends of government; I do not pretend to possess remedies for
all the political ills to which our nation is heir.  But I venture to
criticize those politicians, in either great party, who, far from
being philosophers in action, are merely what Burke and his
contemporaries called "placemen":  that is, seekers after the power
and the emoluments of public office, not scrupulous as to the means by
which advantages for themselves may be obtained.  The demagogue seeks
for himself a cozy place in the political sunshine.
<P>
      In my previous lecture of this series, I touched upon some
errors of the Republican Party, under George Bush, in affairs domestic
and in affairs abroad.  Today I turn to the errors of the Democratic
Party, under leaders of recent years.  For the past decade the
Democrats have been an opposition party -- that is, in opposition to
the national Executive Force.  In their opposition the Democrats, with
some honorable exceptions, have gained little credit for themselves.
<P>
      Difficult Attitudes.  The Democratic party claims descent from
Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans, but any remaining relationship to
Jeffersonians is difficult to discern.  In its origins, the Democratic
Party at the beginning of the nineteenth century was the champion of
the agricultural and rural interest, the defender of states' powers as
opposed to political centralization, the advocate of hard money and
the opponent of national debt.  Democratic attitudes nowadays are very
different.
<P>
      For at Democratic national conventions, the cry is all for
grander federal expenditures and piling up of more debt, in
consequence.  With few exceptions, the leading Democrats would
centralize everything, not bothering to reflect upon what the word
"federal" signifies.  For the most part ignoring the remnant of
America's rural population, the Democrats are subservient to organized
"minorities" in America's great decayed cities; upon the proletariat
they are sedulous to confer more "entitlements," on humanitarian
principles.  Senator Moynihan and a handful of other Democratic
legislators think seriously about our urban afflictions, seeking
practical remedies, a difficult task; but most Democrats in office
hold by the exploded notion that legislative bodies can sweep away
social conundrums by throwing money at them.
<P>
      Democratic Majorities. In presidential contests, the Democrats
have won only one of the past six elections, and take a dim view of
their own prospects in the election of 1992.  The ethnic coalition
from which they drew a great part of their support in the Roosevelt
and Truman years has been dissolving; the labor unions that delivered
a massive Democratic vote have been diminishing in numbers and in
zeal; white voters in the Old South have shifted, a great many of
them, to the Republican ticket; the Democratic party seems devoid of
imagination and deprived of true leadership.  How is it, then, that
Democratic majorities prevail in House and Senate?
<P>
      The answer to that question seems to be that in presidential
elections, the voting public becomes fairly well aware of the issues
in dispute and of the personalities of the candidates:  massive
television coverage, prolonged newspaper discussion, and candidates'
debates give the typical voter some notion of what the Republican
presidential candidate and the Democratic candidate respectively think
and propose.  So informed, the majority of citizens then vote for the
Republican, having found him nearer to their hearts' desire.
<P>
      For the Democrats, in their endeavor to cater to even the most
unlikely "minority," have alienated the majority in nearly every state
of the Union.  The American public is conservative in its sentiments,
for the most part; and when the contest occurs between candidates
recognizably conservative and candidates recognizably liberal or
radical, the public prefers the conservative.  The governor of New
York, Mario Cuomo, so often mentioned as a possible Democratic
presidential candidate, at present is vigorously advocating a bill in
the New York legislature to confer special privileges upon
homosexuals.  The fancied political advantage to be gained by pleasing
pathics will be overwhelmed by public opinion if ever Mr.  Cuomo
confronts President Bush or any other Republican nominee who does not
endeavor to reward sexual deviancy.  What a genius the Democrats this
past quarter-century have developed for misjudging public opinion!
<P>
      Republican Goal.  How is it, then, that nevertheless the
Democratic party holds a majority, most of the time, in both Senate
and House?  Why, in the election of Senators and Representatives, the
typical voter is ill informed about the views of the respective
candidates, and knows next to nothing of their voting records,
supposing them to be incumbents of the offices at stake.  The voter
tends to approve a candidate according to what the candidate claims to
have accomplished by way of securing benefits at federal expense for
his state or his congressional district, regardless of the chief
political issues of the hour.  Also the voter in many such elections
is powerfully influenced by name-recognition, so that Democratic
incumbents, long entrenched in office, are almost impossible to
dislodge in many districts and states.  In the long run, possession of
the executive branch of the federal government by Republicans will
work to erode the Democratic majority in both legislative houses.  But
to achieve that success, Republican presidential candidates might have
to forgo the goal of winning all fifty states for their personal
triumph, and instead spend money and time upon electing senators and
representatives.  Presidents Nixon, Reagan, and Bush, although
virtually certain to be elected by wide popular and electoral
majorities, somewhat neglected their duty of trying hard to bring in
Republican Congresses -- or at least their campaign managers failed
them in that respect.
<P>
      However that may be, time is not on the side of the Democratic
Party:  their leaders talk the language of yesteryear.  Mr.  Carter,
addressing the Democratic convention that had nominated him in 1976,
made promises and employed a rhetoric that would have gone down very
well in 1932 or 1936, but were absurdly archaic in the very different
era of the Bicentenary.  Nevertheless, Mr.  Carter won the election --
not because of what he said, but in spite of it.  His successors as
Democratic presidential candidates have behaved with equal absurdity
-- being their own worst enemies -- but did not enjoy the good fortune
to run against a Republican candidate who fancied that Poland was not
Soviet dominated.  Like the Bourbons, the Democrats since F.D.R.  have
learned nothing and forgotten nothing.

<P>

      Time has been when the Democratic leaders were great men.  One
thinks of John C.  Calhoun, or Grover Cleveland.  It has been
otherwise since World War II.  An impartial observer -- from Mars, say
-- necessarily would regard with some misgiving a party headed by
Lyndon Johnson, whose infamy has been exposed by careful biographers;
or a party whose most conspicuous United States Senator nowadays is
the amorous and bibulous gentleman from Massachusetts.  Yet have there
not been Democratic leaders of recent decades who were veritable
Galahads or Percivals, you may inquire?  Why, there were some honest
and able men among those leaders; yet not, perhaps, precisely those
eminent Democrats whom the party panegyrists delight to honor.
<P>
      Take, for instance, the Honorable Hubert Humphrey, long United
States Senator from Minnesota, who since his death has been
politically canonized.  Once upon a time I debated Mr.  Humphrey
before a huge audience in Ann Arbor.  I found him an amiable man,
courteous, forthright when assailed by a band of student fidelistas in
the crowd; but excessively fond of the sound of his own voice, for
which indeed he apologized to me at the debate's end.  Yet Senator
Humphrey did not lead a career free of all stain and reproach.  I do
not refer to peccadillos of the sort committed by Mr.  Gary Hart: 
rather, I mean a conflict of interest of the gravest kind, in which
Humphrey put his own interest above the interest of the foreign policy
of the United States -- a case involving the security of the North
Atlantic Treaty allies.
<P>
      Primary Defeat.  What I am about to tell you never has been
published before, although some reference to it will appear in my
memoirs.  Let me preface my narration by reminding you, ladies and
gentlemen, of the hard-fought Democratic primary in West Virginia
during the year 1960.  Senator Kennedy was pitted against Senator
Humphrey; a vast amount of money was expended by both presidential
aspirants.  Eugene McCarthy, a Democrat as honest as he is
interesting, said to me once that this West Virginia primary was the
most corrupt episode in the political history of the United States. 
However that may be, Humphrey lost the primary, if somewhat narrowly;
therefore he lost his party's presidential nomination.  And he was
left forlorn with a great mass of West Virginia debts upon his
shoulders.
<P>
      So much for that, just now.  Our scene shifts from West Virginia
to Turkey; the events to be described occur three to four years after
Hubert Humphrey's defeat.  I am about to quote to you, verbatim, a
report made to me by a retired Foreign Service officer who at the time
of those events was assigned to duties in the Near East and the Middle
East.  I have known this former diplomat for a good many years and
have complete confidence in his veracity.
<P>
      "One of the kindest and most helpful men in the Senate," my
informant commences, "was Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota." 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
           He seemed sensitive to the national interest, willing
      to resist special interests of the financial or ethnic
      sort, and always ready to understand State's views, to
      advise, and to help when he could.  He even "condescended"
      to me socially in the grand old meaning of that word.
<P>
           In the mid-fifties, the legendary hero Ismet Inonu,
      successor to Kemal Ataturk, surprised the world by
      permitting a free and fair national election, and by giving
      up power peacefully when he lost to Adnan Menderes. 
      Menderes, with broad peasant support, won handily and
      installed his own regime in place of that of Inonu, who
      became leader of the Opposition.  Within a short time the
      Menderes government became the stage of typical Third World
      financial corruption, much of it involving rake-offs in
      alleged "development" contracts with foreign firms.  When
      Menderes began to deprive the Opposition of its political
      rights and even threatened the personal safety of Inonu,
      the armed forces, feeling that their role in society had
      been betrayed, threw out Menderes and his friends and
      reinstalled Inonu.
<P>
           Inonu, whose administration was reasonably honest by
      Turkish standards, had the backing of the Army in bringing
      to trial and punishment Turkish politicians and officials
      believed to have been among the worst of the grafters.  In
      one of many cases, several officials were punished for
      accepting large bribes from an American ("The Promoter")
      who had contracted to provide a complete small steel mill
      to Turkey.  It was shown in the trial that the "mill" was
      actually the old, rusted, and broken-down hardware from a
      plant on the southern U.S.  coast which had been closed as
      obsolete and sold by the owners to The Promoter for one or
      two million dollars; for the plant owners it was of value
      only as scrap.  The Turkish regime was no more than amused
      when The Promoter, who would have been arrested for fraud,
      bribery, and conspiracy if he had entered Turkey, formally
      asked the Turkish government for his final payment of ten
      million dollars under the contract.  He pointed out that
      the machinery in question had been delivered, even though
      it was just rusting on the docks in Turkey.  The Turkish
      government refused, noting that expert testimony in the
      trial had proved the machinery to be inoperable, worthless,
      and not as specified in the contract.  It suggested that if
      The Promoter wished to pursue his claim further, he follow
      the contract and file suit in a Turkish court, and that if
      he felt this clause was not binding, that he join the
      Turkish government in submitting the dispute to
      international commercial arbitration through established
      private institutions.  The Promoter refused to accept that
      he had not fulfilled his contract, refused to pursue the
      matter through either of the suggested channels, and again
      demanded early payment.  The Turks paid no further
      attention to him; they were convinced he would lose an
      arbitration and be assessed the costs of arbitration.

    <P>  
           The annual foreign-aid legislation then came before
      the Senate.  To our stupefied surprise, Senator Humphrey
      offered and pushed to adoption an amendment so worded as to
      apply only to The Promoter's claim, to the effect that no
      U.S.  military assistance would be provided to any country
      under the bill as long as claims by an American contractor
      for goods or services already provided had not been met in
      full.  It was further specified that the alleged quality of
      goods/services delivered could not affect the requirement,
      nor could any provisions of a contract providing for means
      of adjudicating or arbitrating the amount claimed.  This
      was called The Humphrey Amendment, and was an object of
      amusement or outrage at State and on Capitol Hill, but was
      never the subject of press inquiry, analysis, or interest. 
      The White House and State queried Humphrey's staff about
      the possibility of a compromise, but were told that if
      Senator Humphrey were to be kept on board the entire
      foreign-aid project, the Amendment must become law.  Our
      own bureau queried the staffs of Senators Fulbright and
      Mansfield to see if they couldn't make Humphrey back off or
      at least compromise.  One of Fulbright's top staffers told
      me that Humphrey, very uncharacteristically, refused to
      discuss the Amendment, except to say that it was a matter
      of principle to avoid the robbing of one of his
      constituents (The Promoter), and that he, the Senator,
      would not change a word of it.  Humphrey's prestige was
      such that he easily beat back the half-hearted move to
      reconsider the Amendment, and the Administration did not
      want to tangle with him over a measly ten million dollars.
<P>
           The bill became law with the Amendment.  Reluctantly
      we told the Turks that deliveries of new material as
      provided in the legislation and as planned by NATO could
      not be made until The Promoter was paid.  The Turks, who
      were as loyal as any ally we had, and Inonu, who had always
      co-operated with us fully, pointed out the effect on the
      Turkish armed forces of the delay of scheduled deliveries,
      and, conversely, the effect on Turkish public opinion as to
      both the U.S.  and Inonu government if the money were paid
      to The Promoter.  There was nothing we could do.  Finally
      Inonu had to ask his Parliament for ten million dollars in
      public funds to pay The Promoter before hundreds of
      millions of dollars worth of NATO materials could be
      delivered.  The Opposition pointed out with gusto the
      overwhelming proof advanced in earlier legal proceedings
      that the project was one of bribery and fraud from the
      beginning, and that the machinery was nothing but scrap. 
      Inonu swallowed the dishonor, got the money, paid The
      Promoter, and got the arms and ammunition.
<P>
           While the legislation was still before the Senate, we
      enlisted the help of a friendly office of the FBI, which had
      helped us in the past, to check The Promoter's background on
      this and earlier deals, in the hope of finding something which
      could be used to influence other Senators.  The world-weary FBI
      man, an old friend, who had conducted most of the search and
      directed it all, came in to tell me that The Promoter was quite
      shady and could be termed a boardroom confidence man, but that
      he had never been convicted -- only a couple of unpursued
      indictments in minor scandals.  As we talked I opined that The
      Promoter just couldn't by himself wield that much influence with
      the Senator -- that there must be a more weighty partner in the
      woodpile.  I asked him if he could, strictly on his own and to
      satisfy my personal curiosity, try to dig up such a partner. 
      The FBI man came in a week or two later, warned me that this
      meeting with me was not occurring, and informed me that there
      was a partner on halves with The Promoter who bought in for a
      pittance during the past year, and that the partner's name was
      the maiden name of Muriel Humphrey.
      <P>
           During the rest of my assignment at State we continued
      to receive the best possible co-operation from Senator
      Humphrey in all other matters, and his personal affability
      was undiminished.  On reflection, and considering the
      common gossip that Humphrey was tragically in debt
      following his primary collision with the Kennedy moneybags,
      I could not work up much indignation against the Senator
      personally.  I saved my indignation for the interface
      between foreign aid and the American political system, and
      slowly began to drift toward the conclusion that any good
      done by foreign aid was outweighed by the damage it caused
      here and abroad.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      At this point, my friend's narrative ceases.  Permit me to
comment that I have no animus against Hubert Humphrey.  I recount this
episode merely to suggest that even the more genuine of democratic
idols may be found to have feet of clay.  At least Senator Humphrey
needed the money in question.  During the Kennedy and Johnson
Administrations, probably the richest man in the Senate was the most
corrupt of senators:  Kerr of Oklahoma, whose devious enriching ways
are candidly described by his lieutenant, Bobby Baker, in the latter
scoundrel's memoirs.  To perceive how deep in peculation was President
Johnson himself, assisted by his agents Bobby Baker and Billy Sol
Estes, one may turn to the recent memoirs of a Republican of
integrity, Senator Carl Curtis, entitled Forty Years Against the Tide.
<P>
      Doubtless a number of persons present today have read Henry
Adams' novel Democracy.  In that book, an elderly diplomat from
Eastern Europe grows exasperated with a pompous American senator whose
character is suspect.  Baron Jacobi is referring to political
corruption about the year 1870:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
           You Americans believe yourselves to be exempted from
      the operation of general laws.  You care not for
      experience.  I have lived seventy-five years, and all that
      time in the midst of corruption.  I am corrupt myself, only
      I do have the courage to proclaim it, and you others have
      it not.  Rome, Paris, Vienna, Petersburg, London, all are
      corrupt; only Washington is pure!  Well, I declare to you
      that in all my experiences I have found no society which
      has had elements of corruption like the United States.  The
      children in the street are corrupt, and know how to cheat
      me.  The citizens are all corrupt, and also the towns and
      the counties and the States' legislatures and the judges. 
      Everywhere men betray trusts both public and private, steal
      money, run away with public funds.  Only in the Senate men
      take no money.  And you gentlemen in the Senate very well
      declare that your great United States, which is the head of
      the civilized world, can never learn anything from the
      example of corrupt Europe.  You are right -- quite right! 
      The great United States needs not an example.  I do much
      regret that I have not yet one hundred years to live.  If I
      could then come back to this city, I should find myself
      very content -- much more than now.  I am always content
      where there is much corruption, and ma parole d'honneur!" 
      broke out the old man with fire and gesture, "The United
      States will then be more corrupt than Rome under Caligula;
      more corrupt than the Church under Leo X; more corrupt than
      France under the Regent!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Baron Jacobi's prophecy has come to pass, more than a century
later.  Everyone in this room is aware that two very eminent
Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives, last year found it
prudent to resign their seats rather than face expulsion.  Everyone
also knows of the several senators who betrayed their trust in
connection with the savings and loan disaster.  Everyone has read of,
if not experienced, the maladministration of demagogic mayors elected
on the Democratic ticket in certain great cities, Washington
especially.  Corruption is not confined to the Democratic party's
placemen, of course; but corruption seems to have become epidemic in
the Democratic Party during recent decades.
<P>
      Accepting bribes, pocketing public funds, and selling political
influence are not the worst forms of political corruption.  For more
malignant still is that professed political humanitarianism which is
merely a mask for a politician's lust for power and place.  Such
politicians, and they are legion in today's Democratic apparatus,
extemporize flimsy measures that will procure for them an evanescent
popularity.  Senator Carl Curtis tells of a conversation, some years
ago, with a senatorial colleague of this stamp.  That colleague had
been active in the passage of a fiscal bill that in the long run would
be immensely costly -- almost insupportable.  Curtis expostulated on
what would be the consequences thirty years in the future.  "But I
won't be in the Senate when that happens," said his colleague. 
Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.
<P>
      Grim Mistake. My point is this:  the greatest error of the
Democratic Party nowadays is dishonesty.  Here permit me to quote one
of my less-favorite authors, Voltaire:  "It was worse than a crime: 
it was a mistake."  When a Democratic Congress appropriates vast sums
for new federal undertakings, but reproaches the executive branch for
increasing the national debt, the Democrats are dishonest -- as they
are in other great concerns.  Such political hypocrisy is not a crime
for which public men may be indicted; but it is a grim mistake.  For
presently a party that so behaves will be recognized by the public as
a dishonest party, and then its days will be numbered.
<P>
      When Ronald Reagan was re-elected to the presidency by so
overwhelming a majority, I suggested in public addresses that
conceivably the Democratic Party might begin to split into factions
and to follow the Federalist Party and the Whig Party down to dusty
death.  That process may be at work, despite temporary Democratic
majorities in the Congress.  More than the Republicans, the Democrats
have become suspect to a great part of the American public.  They are
suspected of ignoring the national interest.
<P>
      This present decade, just begun, will be a time when the United
States of America must make irrevocable decisions, in affairs domestic
and affairs international.  We would be foolish to fancy that a pax
Americana will settle upon the world.  Rather, our situation is very
like that of Britain just two centuries ago.  As Burke wrote then:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> I despair neither of the public fortune nor of the public
      mind.  There is much to be done undoubtedly, and much to be
      retrieved.  We must walk in new ways, or we can never
      encounter our enemy in his devious march.  We are not at an
      end of our struggle, nor near it.  Let us not deceive
      ourselves; we are at the beginning of great troubles.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Party Reform. Just so.  In our time of troubles, either great
political party requires high prudence, high imagination, high
honesty.  Surely the Bush Administration, which I criticized somewhat
mordantly in the course of my preceding Heritage lecture in this
series, ought to be the object of severe but honest scrutiny by the
opposing Democrats.  There are yet active in the Democratic ranks many
honorable men and women capable of working a party reform.  May they
come forward, for the sake of the Republic!
<P>
      After all, reform is within the power of honest members of the
party.  Here I quote Burke's Thoughts on the Present Discontents once
more:
<P>
     <BLOCKQUOTE> Until a confidence in government is re-established, the
      people ought to be excited to a more strict and detailed
      attention to the conduct of their representatives. 
      Standards for judging more systematically upon their
      conduct ought to be settled in the meetings of counties and
      corporations.  Frequent and correct lists of the voters in
      all important questions ought to be procured.
<P>
      By such means something may be done.  By such means it may
      appear who those are that, by an indiscriminate support of
      all administrations, have totally banished all integrity
      and confidence out of public proceedings; have confounded
      the best men with the worst; and weakened and dissolved,
      instead of strengthening and compacting, the general frame
      of government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      From the precinct and the township upward, conceivably, the
Democratic Party may be chastened and reinvigorated.  Certain
Democratic office-holders need to be taught afresh the old lesson,
"Honesty is the best policy."  In a genuine parliamentary system, at
least two strong and principled parties are required.  A party
dominated by frauds and fantastics cannot long endure.  If the
Democrats fail at reform, some other party, the nature of which cannot
now be predicted, will supplant the Democratic Party.  That is what
happened to the Liberal party in Britain.  Democratic reform lacking,
the American public may be tempted to shout an old Republican partisan
cry:  "Rotten eggs and dead cats are good enough for Democrats!"

<P>


      Now that the United States has become, temporarily, the greatest
power in the world, some of us recall an observation, half a century
ago, by the French writer Andre Siegfried:  "The United States is the
only country to have passed from barbarism to decadence without having
known civilization."  At the end of the twentieth century, have
Americans intelligence and imagination sufficient to lead the peoples
of the world?  Indeed, do Americans possess talents sufficient to
maintain their present degree of security and prosperity?
<P>
      These are grave, if not fatal, questions.  Decisions are being
made nowadays, in public policies abroad and at home, that may be
irrevocable.  And it appears that such decisions may be based upon
erroneous assumptions.
  <P>    Therefore I offer you during this year of our Lord one thousand
nine hundred and ninety-one, ladies and gentlemen, a series of four
lectures on the general topic "Political Errors at the End of the
Twentieth Century."  My first lecture, to be delivered to you this
very day, is entitled "Republican Errors"; the second, this spring,
will be "Democratic Errors"; the third, in summer or fall, will be
"International Errors"; the concluding one, "The Politics of Reality,"
when I will suggest some paths to truth in public policy.
<P>
      I commence with an examination of the state of mind and heart in
America's two great political parties; and of the two, I venture first
to touch upon certain errors prevalent in the Republican Party.  I
have known various Republican presidents, presidential candidates,
members of Congress, governors, and other party leaders, all the way
from Herbert Hoover to my friend and neighbor, John Engler, very
recently elected governor of Michigan against heavy odds:  From time
to time I have had a hand in their campaigns, especially in those of
Senator Goldwater.  I was on cordial terms with President Nixon and
President Reagan.  My wife and I succeeded in reconciling the several
factions of the Republican Party in Michigan, on the eve of the
national convention which chose Mr.  Bush as the party's nominee for
the presidency.  So you will understand, ladies and gentlemen, that in
my lamenting of the present state of Republican leadership in
Washington, I am more moved by sorrow than by wrath.
<P>
      Stolid Party. During this twentieth century the Republican Party
has been more stolid than imaginative.  It has attracted public
support by its appearance of practicality, its defense of private
property and of a competitive economy, its reluctance -- most of the
time -- to embark upon adventures abroad.  Although praised as the
party of industry and business, also, at least in my Michigan
backwoods, Republicans were the representatives of the rural interest. 
In short, it has been a broad-based party which, in recent decades,
has made considerable gains in the region that used to be the Solid
South.  Of presidents taking office since World War II, five have been
Republican, three Democratic.  The tremendous margins of victory
enjoyed by Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush in their
presidential campaigns seemed to suggest that the Republican Party
might sweep away the Democratic Party within a few years, as long
before the Federalist Party, and the Whig, had gone to the wall.
<P>
      Yet the Republican Party, which achieved its greatest vigor in
this century during the presidential terms of Ronald Reagan, now seems
in the sere and yellow leaf.  Permit me to discuss with you, for a
quarter of an hour, the domestic errors of the Republican national
administration, and then to examine, for the second quarter of an
hour, that administration's blunders in foreign policy.
<P>
      My task with respect to the fiscal measures of the Bush
Administration is made the easier for me by Dr.  Edwin Feulner's
"State of Conservatism, 1991" message, entitled "Fashionably Out of
Fashion Again."  I concur heartily in his observation that "after more
than eight years of steady growth, a combination of new federal taxes,
out-of control spending increasing, and suffocating regulatory burdens
have conspired to send the economy into spasms."  Federal expenditure
soon will exceed a quarter of the gross national product; the deficits
for the present fiscal year and for the fiscal year 1992 will be the
largest in the history of the United States.  The reforms of income
tax and inheritance tax, worked in the Reagan years, are undone.  As
socialism dissolves in Eastern Europe, in the United States, an
unofficial and unproclaimed form of socialism gains ground. 
<P>
      Why has this come to pass?  Why does a national administration
elected on a conservative platform offer such feeble resistance to
measures advocated by doctrinaire liberals.
<P>
      "Rockefeller Republicans."  Why, one ought not to blame Mr. 
Bush unduly.  When he stood for the Republican presidential nomination
against Mr.  Reagan in 1980, of necessity he turned for support to the
liberal wing of the Republican Party.  That wing had insufficient
strength to secure him the nomination; but in the course of the
contest he acquired advisors and helpers best classified as
"Rockefeller Republicans."  Those people, some of them eminent, are at
his side still, and have his ear.
<P>
      An anecdote will illustrate my point.  While, in 1988, Mr.  Bush
was campaigning vigorously, I was invited to confer with an inner
circle of his staff, in Washington.  Mr.  Bush was busy elsewhere, but
kindly telephoned me during the course of the discussion.  One of the
pieces of advice I had offered to the Bush people there was to
emphasize Mr.  Bush's opposition to abortion-on-demand; I said he has
consistently advocated the sound policy of returning the abortion
question to the police powers of the several states.  My remark was
received with an embarrassed silence; clearly some people present very
much favored abortion.  A little later I pointed out that in national
publicity, the Bush campaign should refer repeatedly to Mr.  Bush's
conservatism.
<P>
      "What has he done that's conservative?"  inquired, perhaps
rhetorically, a Young Lion of the Bush.  I might have pointed to his
intelligently conservative years in the House of Representatives, but
contented myself at the moment by suggesting that others present might
know Mr.  Bush's principal views and utterances better than I did. 
Some of Mr.  Bush's people there present in the headquarters shivered
at that dread word "conservative."
<P>
      I am suggesting that all presidents, in some degree, are held
captive by the inner circles of the Executive Force, their own
Executive Force.  I doubt whether President Bush himself inclined
initially to the fiscal measures that presently he accepted; but those
close about him persuaded him of the need for such damaging
concessions to liberals' demands.
<P>
      Now the Republican Party long boasted of its frugality.  The
Bush Administration, on the contrary, has stolen some of the
Democrats' old clothes while the sons of Jefferson and Jackson were
out bathing.  But those purloined garments are ragged; and Republicans
look odd and unconvincing when clad in them. 
<P>
      Oppressive Taxation. With respect to a sharp increase in the
level of taxes, it seems as if the Bush Administration really does not
understand the principle of diminishing returns, or know the history
of the consequences of excessive taxation.  When computing our federal
income tax very recently, my wife and I discovered that more than half
our gross income is taken in taxation -- federal income tax; Social
Security taxes; state income taxes; village, township, and county
taxes, school property tax; sales taxes.  And we are not of the number
of Franklin Roosevelt's "malefactors of great wealth."  We are in the
process of educating four young daughters, paying off mortgages,
trying to save something for one's declining years -- I, being
seventy-two years of age already -- and contributing to charitable
causes.  Yet we are better off than many taxpayers.  What straw will
break the camel's back?
<P>
      A state that annually exacts in taxes half of a citizen's income
is more oppressive, financially, than the despotisms of old.  In the
ancient monarchies of China, a tax load of more than ten percent would
have been thought unjust.  Excessive taxation is a major cause of the
decline and fall of great states:  so writes C.  Northcote Parkinson,
the author of Parkinson's Law, in his last book.
<P>
      "Taxation, taken to the limit and beyond, has always been a sign
of decadence and a prelude to disaster," as Parkinson puts it.  "For
government expenditure is the chief cause of inflation and is also the
means of government interference in commercial, industrial, and social
life.  Where evil has been averted it has normally been from lack of
funds.  Where evil has been done it was usually because the
perpetrators had money to spend."
<P>
      Billion Dollars Daily.  The Bush Administration had one handsome
prospect for reducing governmental expenditure, reducing the federal
deficit, and possibly even making a gesture at reduction of the
federal debt:  that is, the prospective contraction of the armed
forces, what with the dwindling of the Soviet menace.  Instead, Mr. 
Bush has plunged the United States into a war which, so far, has cost
about a billion dollars a day.  (You will recall that a billion
dollars is a thousand million dollars.) Already, more taxation to pay
for this struggle in the Levant is being discussed in Washington.  So
I quote Parkinson once more:  "Taxes become heavier in time of war and
should diminish, by rights, when the war is over.  That is not,
however, what happens.  Although sometimes lowered when the war ends,
taxes seldom regain their pre-war level.  That is because the level of
expenditure rises to meet the war-time level of taxation."
<P>
      Unless the Bush Administration abruptly reverses its fiscal and
military course, I suggest, the Republican Party must lose its former
good repute for frugality, and become the party of profligate
expenditure, "butter and guns."  And public opinion would not long
abide that.  Nor would America's world influence and America's
remaining prosperity.
<P>
      But, time running on, I must turn to affairs diplomatic and
military:  Republican errors internationally.  What are we to say of
Mr.  Bush's present endeavor to bring to pass a gentler, kinder New
World Order?
<P>
      Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Lyndon
Johnson were enthusiasts for American domination of the world.  Now
George Bush appears to be emulating those eminent Democrats.  When the
Republicans, once upon a time, nominated for the presidency a "One
World" candidate, Wendell Willkie, they were sadly trounced.  In
general, Republicans throughout the twentieth century have been
advocates of prudence and restraint in the conduct of foreign affairs.
<P>
      But Mr.  Bush, out of mixed motives, has embarked upon a radical
course of intervention in the region of the Persian Gulf.  After
carpet-bombing the Cradle of Civilization as no country ever had been
bombed before, Mr.  Bush sent in hundreds of thousands of soldiers to
overrun the Iraqi bunkers -- that were garrisoned by dead men,
asphyxiated.
<P>
      And for what reason?  The Bush Administration found it difficult
to answer that question clearly.  In the beginning it was implied that
the American national interest required low petroleum prices: 
therefore, if need be, smite and spare not!
<P>
      That excuse reminds me of Burke's rebuke to the Pitt ministry in
1795, when it appeared that the British government was about to go to
war with France over the question of the navigation of the River
Scheldt, in the Netherlands.  "A war for the Scheldt?  A war for a
chamber-pot!"  Burke exclaimed.  Now one may say, "A war for Kuwait? 
A war for an oilcan!"
<P>
      "The blood of a man should never be shed but to redeem the blood
of man," Burke wrote in his first Letter on a Regicide Peace.  "It is
well shed for our family, for our friends, for our God, for our
country, for our kind.  The rest is vanity; the rest is crime."  Burke
was eager that England declare war against France because of the
menace of the French revolutionaries to the civilized order of Europe,
and because of their systematic crimes.  But he set his face against
war for mere commercial advantage.  So should Republicans.  "The rest
is vanity; the rest is crime."
<P>
      War for Righteousness. A war for an oilcan not turning out to be
popular, however, President Bush turned moralist; he professed to be
engaged in redeeming the blood of man; and his breaking of Iraq is to
be the commencement of his beneficent New World Order.  Mr.  Bush has
waged what Sir Herbert Butterfield, in his little book Christianity,
Diplomacy, and War, calls "The War for Righteousness."  As Butterfield
begins the third chapter of that book, "It has been held by
technicians of politics in recent times that democracies can only be
keyed up to modern war -- only brought to the necessary degree of
fervor -- provided they are whipped into moral indignation and heated
to fanaticism by the thought that they are engaged in a 'war for
righteousness'." 
<P>
      Now indubitably Saddam Hussein is unrighteous; but so are nearly
all the masters of the "emergent" African states (with the Ivory Coast
as a rare exception), and so are the grim ideologues who rule China,
and the hard men in the Kremlin, and a great many other public figures
in various quarters of the world.  Why, I fancy that there are some
few unrighteous men, conceivably, in the domestic politics of the
United States.  Are we to saturation-bomb most of Africa and Asia into
righteousness, freedom, and democracy?  And, having accomplished that,
however would we ensure persons yet more unrighteous might not rise up
instead of the ogres we had swept away?  Just that is what happened in
the Congo, remember, three decades ago; and nowadays in Zaire, once
called the Belgian Congo, we zealously uphold with American funds the
dictator Mobutu, more blood-stained than Saddam.  And have we
forgotten Castro in Cuba?
<P>
      Momentum of Its Own. I doubt whether much good is going to come
out of the slaughter of perhaps a hundred thousand people in Iraq. 
"For one of the troubles of war," Butterfield writes, "is that it
acquires its own momentum and plants its own ideals on our shoulders,
so that we are carried far away from the purposes with which we began
-- carried indeed sometimes to greater acts of spoilation than the
ones which had provoked our original entry into the war.  Before the
war of 1914 had lasted a year, its own workings had generated such a
mood that we had promised Russia Constantinople and had bought the
alliance of Italy with offers of booty, some of which had later to be
disavowed by President Wilson.  And it is a remarkable fact that in
wars which purport to be so ethical that the states attached to
neutrality are sometimes regarded as guilty of a dereliction of duty,
the great powers primarily concerned may have required an iniquitous
degree of bribery to bring them into the conflict, or to maintain
their fidelity.  The whole ideal of moderate peace aims, and the whole
policy of making war the servant (instead of the master) of
negotiation, is impossible -- and the whole technique of the 'war for
righteousness' has a particularly sinister application -- when even in
the ostensibly 'defending' party there is a latent and concealed
aggressiveness of colossal scope, as there certainly was in 1914."
<P>
      You may perceive some parallels between Butterfield's
description of the course of the Allies during World War I and the
course, so far, of the coalition against Iraq.  Already there is talk
of what shall be done with the "remains of Iraq."  Mr.  James Baker
talks of rebuilding Iraq; others talk of dismantling Iraq altogether,
by way of spoilation.  And what promises and bribes were provided by
the government of the United States, in recent months, to secure the
assent of such murderous governments as that of Ethiopia to strong
measures against Iraq; to secure, indeed, by holding out prospects of
massive economic aid, the cooperation of the Soviet Union, Iraq's
former patron?
<P>
      Was not Egypt's cooperation obtained by forgiving the Egyptian
government's indebtedness of several billion dollars?  Was not Syria's
assent gained by America's ignoring of the Syrian conquest of the
Lebanon, with a massacre of General Aoun's Christian army?  What began
as determination to restore a legitimate (if somewhat arbitrary)
government in Kuwait may result in the overturn of several governments
in the Levant.  As for regarding neutral states as guilty of
dereliction of duty -- why, the United States has done just that to
Jordan, by cutting off economic aid at the very time when Jordan is
crammed with destitute refugees from Iraq.
<P>
      Disagreeable Consequences.  In short, deliberate entry into war
commonly brings on consequences disagreeable even to the seeming
victors.  Prudent statesmen long have known that armed conflict, for
all involved, ought to be the last desperate resort, to be entered
upon only when all means of diplomacy, conciliation, and compromise
have been exhausted.  In Iraq, we have crushed an insect with the club
of Hercules.  Temporarily, Mr.  Bush's stroke is popular.  When a
democracy goes to war, at first there occurs a wave of enthusiasm: 
"Bop the Wop; sap the Jap; get the Hun on the run!"  But afterward,
when troubles arise.... 
<P>
      True, we did not suffer a long war in the deserts of Kuwait and
Iraq.  But we must expect to suffer during a very long period of
widespread hostility toward the United States -- even, or perhaps
especially, from the people of certain states that America bribed or
bullied into combining against Iraq.
<P>
      In Egypt, in Syria, in Pakistan, in Algeria, in Morocco, in all
of the world of Islam, the masses now regard the United States as
their arrogant adversary; while the Soviet Union, by virtue of its
endeavors to mediate the quarrel in its later stages, may pose again
as the friend of Moslem lands.  Nor is this all:  for now, in every
continent, the United States is resented increasingly as the last and
most formidable of imperial systems.
<P>
      In this century, great empires have collapsed:  the Austrian,
the German, the British, the French, the Dutch, the Portuguese, the
Spanish, the Italian, and the Japanese.  The Soviet empire now
languishes in the process of dissolution.  "Imperialism" has become a
term of bitter reproach and complaint; all this within my own
lifetime.
<P>
      American Empire.  But there remains an American Empire, still
growing -- though expanding through the acquisition of client states,
rather than through settlement of American populations abroad.  Among
the client states directly dependent upon American military power are
Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Israel, and El Salvador; and until the
withdrawal of American divisions from Germany for service in Arabia,
Germany, too, was a military client.  Dependent upon American
assistance of one kind or another, and in some degree upon American
military protection, are the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, and
Panama; and also, in the Levant, Egypt and Jordan, and formerly
Lebanon.  Now Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are added to the roster of
clients.  I hardly need mention America's earlier acquisitions: 
Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgins, and lesser islands.  I refrain from
mentioning America's economic ascendancy, through foreign aid or
merely trade, over a great deal more of the world.  In short, although
we never talk about our empire, a tremendous American Empire has come
into existence -- if, like the Roman Empire, in a kind of fit of
absence of mind.  No powerful counterpoise to the American hegemony
seems to remain, what with the enfeebling of the U.S.S.R.
<P>
      Such a universal ascendancy always has been resented by the
lesser breeds without the law.  Soon there sets to work a widespread
impulse to pull down the imperial power.  But that imperial power,
strong in weapons, finds it possible for a time to repress the
disobedient.  In the long run -- well, as Talleyrand put it, "You can
do everything with bayonets -- except sit on them."  In the long run,
the task of repression is too painful a burden to bear; so the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union has discovered in the past few
years.  Napoleon discovered that hard truth earlier and King George
III and the King's Friends discovered it between the years 1775 and
1781.  Doubtless George Bush means well by the world near the end of
the twentieth century.  He is a man of order, diligent, dutiful,
honest, and a good family man.  But he lacks imagination, "the vision
thing."  And power intoxicates; and, as Lord Acton put it, power tends
to corrupt.  The love of power tends to corrupt both speech and
actions.  It may corrupt a grave national undertaking into a personal
vendetta.  It may corrupt what began as a chivalric rescue into a
heavy belligerent domination.  (Talk continues to come to our ears of
a "permanent American presence" in the Persian Gulf.)
<P>
      President Bush and Americans of his views doubtless intend the
American hegemony to be gentler and kinder than the sort of hegemony
that prevailed in the ancient Persian Empire, say; more just even than
the Roman hegemony that gave peace, for some centuries, to several
lands -- relative peace, anyway, at the price of crushing taxation and
the extinction of earlier cultures.  But devastating Iraq (and the
rescued Kuwait) is an uncompromising way of opening an era of
sweetness and light.  Peoples so rescued from tyrants might cry, as
did the boy whom Don Quixote de la Mancha had saved from beating by
the muleteers but who was thrashed by them not long later,
nevertheless -- "In the name of God, Don Jorge de la Casablanca, don't
rescue me again!"
<P>
      Don Jorge de la Casablanca has toppled and imprisoned one
Central American despot -- somewhat small fry -- and is in the process
of dealing after the same fashion with one Mesopotamian despot,
somewhat larger fry.  "Well done!"  some cry.  It has all been rather
like deer hunting in my Michigan back woods.
<P>
      Yet presidents of the United States must not be encouraged to
make Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace, nor to fancy that they can
establish a New World Order through eliminating dissenters.  In the
second century before Christ, the Romans generously liberated the
Greek city-states from the yoke of Macedonia.  But it was not long
before the Romans felt it necessary to impose upon those quarrelsome
Greeks a domination more stifling to Hellenic freedom and culture than
ever Macedon had been.  It is a duty of the Congress of the United
States to see that great American Caesars do not act likewise.
<P>
      Echo of 1984.  If that duty is forgotten, before many years are
out we may receive such television communications as follows.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      The voice from the telescreen paused.  A trumpet call,
      clear and beautiful, floated into the stagnant air.  The
      voice continued raspingly:
<P>
      "Attention!  Your attention please!  A newsflash has this
      moment arrived from the Malabar front.  Our forces in South
      India have won a glorious victory.  I am authorized to say
      that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war
      within a measurable distance of its end.  Here is the
      newsflash -- "
<P>
      Bad news coming, thought Winston.  And sure enough,
      following a gory description of the annihilation of a
      Eurasian army, with stupendous figures of killed and
      prisoners, came the announcement that, as of next week, the
      chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grams to
      twenty.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

      Perhaps you have already recognized the preceding passage from
Orwell's 1984.  Orwell describes our world of 1991, too.  Perpetual
War for Perpetual Peace comes to pass in an era of Righteousness --
that is, national or ideological self-righteousness in which the
public is persuaded that "God is on our side," and that those who
disagree should be brought here before the bar as war criminals.
<P>
      I shall have more to say about such concerns in my Third
Heritage lecture this year.  Just now I conclude my thoughts on
Republican errors by suggesting that it would be ruinous for the
Republicans to convert themselves into a party of high deeds in
distant lands and higher taxes on the home front.  Such a New World
Order, like the Pax Romana, might create a wilderness and call it
peace; at best, it would reduce the chocolate ration from thirty grams
to twenty.  And in the fullness of time, the angry peoples of the
world would pull down the American Empire, despite its military
ingenuity and its protestations of kindness and gentleness -- even as
the Soviet Empire is being pulled down today, thanks be to God.

Heritage Lect: Federalism and the Environment
 -- Heritage </title>
<b>Heritage Lecture No. 534</b>
<p>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.htm">Lectures and Seminars</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>
<h3>A Federalist's Approach To Protecting the Environment</h3>
<p>
Governor Symington of Arizona delivered the keynote address at the Heritage Foundation's Resource Bank conference, "An Environmental Agenda for the Twenty-First Century" on June 19, 1995.
<p>
<br>
Whenever I join the environmental debate, as I often do, I'm reminded of a problem that conservatives always face. The left regard our environment as their issue, their ideological property. Whatever ideas we might have, whatever arguments we might offer, our motives are always suspect. Here as elsewhere, liberals have a way of turning every rational debate into a contest of emotional authenticity. Any who would challenge them must first demonstrate enough "sensitivity" for the liberals' satisfaction.
<p>
The absurdity of this posture strikes me every time I come to Washington. Often I'm here seeking relief for my state from one or another environmental regulation, edict, or fine. This means constant haggling with Washingtonians eager to tell me what's best for Arizona.
<p>
It's always fascinating to leave behind my hiking boots and the mountains of Arizona, and come here to be lectured by "naturalists" whose rugged trails run through Georgetown, Dupont Circle, and Rock Creek Park. In fact they seem to revere everything about our state -- except for the opinions and livelihoods of the people who live there.
<p>
I have been asked to describe a federalist approach to protecting the environment. Most environmentalists, I suppose, would regard that juxtaposition as some sort of bold intellectual synthesis, as if the two ideas were opposites to be reconciled. By philosophy and instinct, they just equate the environmental cause with centralized federal power. Tonight, I'll explain why I reject that connection -- why, in fact, just the opposite is true. I'd also like to set down some specific proposals for reform and conclude with my vision of wise environmental reform.
<p>
Let's begin in the most basic, common-sense terms.
<p>
Federalism is not some elaborate theory of government. It's the simple insight that most problems are best left to the people nearest to the problem, people with direct knowledge of the circumstances. The more you remove the influence of local power, the more you atrophy the dynamism of local decision making. Government in a federalist system tends to be more efficient, and the people tend to be freer.
<p>
Environmentalism, stripped of the quasi-religious nonsense that today often goes with it, amounts in the end to simple stewardship. At its best, it's the sense all decent people have that with the natural riches given humanity comes a duty to use them wisely. A moral duty, a civic duty, but a quite practical one as well.
<p>
To me, the connection between these ideas -- stewardship and self-government -- could not be more apparent. Obviously, we have to manage our land, water, air, timber, minerals, and wildlife with care. And just as obviously, that duty is usually best understood and carried out by the people living upon that land.
<p>
Sure, there are exceptions. We all recognize that some resources and natural treasures are a national responsibility. Historically, I suppose you could trace this sense of national responsibility back to 1849, when we established the Department of the Interior. In fact, we should restore the Department to its staffing level of 1849. It was the first federal department created after 1789, so its federalist credentials are pretty sound. There is a consensus as to our national stake in good stewardship, and it is of long standing.
<p>
But if we have this consensus, why is there so much bitterness to our environmental disputes?  As I see it, there are two reasons. 
<p>
First, the bitterness, the anger, the endless controversy arise from the methods by which environmentalists and the federal government attempt to carry out their aims. Good stewardship, it seems to me, has to begin with a higher opinion of human nature than many environmentalists today bring to the matter. There would be a lot less bitterness if they did not rely so much upon government dictate and coercion, if they were not always eyeing their fellow citizens with such deep distrust.
<p>
My brand of environmentalism begins with these three assumptions:  Conservation is a public good. Government coercion is a political evil. And the two things cannot go together.
<p>
The other, related reason is that many environmentalists today have forgotten Theodore Roosevelt's reminder that "conservation means development as much as it does protection."  With Teddy Roosevelt, I reject the notion that economic development and environmental stewardship are natural, predestined enemies. In fact, from modern history I draw exactly the opposite lesson.
<p>
Think back for a moment to our first post-Cold War glimpse of the dead lakes and dying forests of the old communist world. This was stewardship, socialist style. And yet even today, it's hard to shake the suspicion that for some environmentalists, the cause is just a pretext for airing their larger grievances against the free market. The extreme wing of the environmental movement has been well described as America's last enclave of socialism. For them, every new industry seems to pose a menacing ecological threat.
<p>
It is the free market that is moving us away from the old smokestack industries and into the age of the computer, which does not pollute and is now our prime aid in understanding and safeguarding the environment. In fact, to free enterprise we owe all the technologies that today make for a more efficient use of natural resources. Think of just about anything in modern life which affords ordinary people comfort, health, peace, and security -- and you'll find a product of free enterprise. What's more, in free market economies alone do people even have the wealth, education, and luxury to sit back to reflect on our duties to nature. Put another way, how's the environmental movement shaping up in India or Cuba?
<p>
My own belief is that if we can overcome these two problems -- the coercion of government and the snobbery of environmentalists -- Americans can truly come together to meet the challenges of nature. This is just another way of saying that the best environmental policy is democracy.
<p>
Now let me give you some examples of the kind of problems we've run into in Arizona. We had one particularly interesting incident just last week.
<p>
Back in the fall, an environmental activist group went to federal court seeking an order that the Fish and Wildlife Service come up with critical habitat designations for the Mexican spotted owl. The judge was Carl Muecke, a retired Federal District Court judge. He duly issued the order. But there were a couple of problems. First, the plan Fish and Wildlife came up with, about four million acres altogether, included Arizona's Prescott National Forest -- where, literally, no owl had ever been spotted. And second, between court order and deadline, Congress passed a moratorium on new federal regulations. Faced with this, the good judge replied in essence:  "Do it anyway!"
<p>
So last week, against the will of Congress, the plan went into effect. Result:  All the state's own forest health initiatives must be put off. We have gridlock in our national forests. In the end we will destroy these habitats. And Mexican spotted owls now have a new vacation spot -- only they don't read court orders, and so they still don't come anywhere near Prescott National Forest. Congressional will was simply disregarded by one arrogant federal judge goaded on by a litigious band of environmental zealots.
<p>
Someone has observed that deep down in every liberal is a commissar yearning to be saluted. On our federal benches are the finest examples of the trait. And with the electoral tide turning against liberals, the situation may get a lot worse before it gets better.
<p>
Here's another example. I have been urging Congress, and will again at every opportunity, to repeal the Endangered Species Act. Why?  Because it is a complete disaster -- to the states, the people, and even the species it was meant to help. Because it has thrown entire regions of the Western United States into profound uncertainty. Because, however noble its original aim, in practice the law has become a tool for radical environmental groups to shut down entire industries. Even more bewildering, it prevents the wise management by the states of forest lands, which has led to pestilence and fire.
<p>
The EPA has long been pushing Arizona to adopt what's known as the California standard of air quality. We've been pushing back, so the case is still in litigation.
<p>
In all its philosophical complexity, our basic argument is this:  Arizona is not California. For example, we have a lot more desert land than they do. The desert raises up a lot of dust and various pollen from its unique vegetation. As a matter of fact, we have found that if the California standard were forced upon Arizona, we could not meet it even square in the middle of Organ Pipe National Monument, which is square in the middle of nowhere. 
<p>
 We've also pointed out to the EPA that air quality is an inconstant thing. When there's construction underway in a given area, obviously that's going to affect the air quality -- but only temporarily. So, for example, the EPA will take its measure in Chandler, where we currently have thousands of new homes under construction and the largest industrial project on Earth.
<p>
I could tell you many more such stories -- I have a collection of them I'll match with any governor in the Union. Solomon Bridge near Safford, Arizona, was washed out, requiring people to drive their kids to school on dangerous roads. The Fish and Wildlife Service said that they couldn't fix the bridge because of an endangered minnow that lived in the river beneath the bridge. We told the people of Safford to go ahead and fix it anyway. They went into the river and fixed the problem, and nobody has heard a peep from the Fish and Wildlife Service.
<p>
But let me end by trying to sort out the lessons I draw from these experiences. Given the audacity of environmentalists, and their cavalier approach to democratic procedures, how can we restore self-government to environmental decisions?
<p>
I believe we need a constitutional amendment imposing term limits on federal judges:  Ten years, and it's time for a good long hike into the real world. They need to go back and live in the world they helped create. This would put an end to the scandalous abuses of our courts by environmental groups, among many other liberal activist groups that can advance their aims only by judicial dictate.
<p>
That's reform number one. If any of you doubts this can be done, I would remind you that there is a political revolution going on. Even if you don't hear it talked about in the U.S. Senate, people are fed up. We are going to return power to the states. States are getting ready to receive this power. And we didn't get this far by thinking small.
<p>
My second proposal is purely organizational. We talk loosely of "federal environmental policy."  But, really, there is no single coherent policy to speak of. What we actually have is a confusion of federal voices, each barking a different set of orders at each state and often competing for bureaucratic turf against one another. In land management the problem is particularly costly and inefficient.
<p>
We have recently read threats of closing national parks and the reinvention of the Forest Service. Unfortunately, in both instances the President has offered sophomoric solutions to significant management problems. The White House and their agencies need to get out of the box and look at efficient reorganization. They must accept the challenge of smaller budgets as an opportunity to make public lands more beneficial to all Americans. Tomorrow I will offer Congress a deal:  You give our State Parks Department management authority over three of your federal monuments and 90 percent of current funding, and we will run them more efficiently and, more than likely, make a profit.
<p>
The situation today is intolerable. There is too much overlap, too much rivalry, too much confusion -- and too little actual service to the public.
<p>
I have a third proposal:  The President should also streamline the Environmental Protection Agency. There are approximately 8,000 EPA employees in the regional offices. It is unclear what these employees do that is not already done by the states. There is nothing that is done in the regional offices that cannot be done in the state environmental agencies.
<p>
I recognize and agree that there needs to be a functional liaison between the states and EPA, but I also believe the present EPA organization is an overly expensive and an increasingly ineffective way to interact with the states. I propose we eliminate the regional offices and establish state offices that are co-located with the primary state agency responsible for the implementation of the nation's environmental laws. Each state office would have 25 to 50 federal employees to work with the state to implement federal laws.
<p>
This partnership would allow for programs to be developed once in partnership rather than developed by each state, only to be second-guessed by the regional offices. This arrangement would also allow the federal employees to better understand state issues because they would be directly involved from the beginning. Even if each office had 50 employees, this would only be 2,500 nationwide -- a reduction of over 68 percent from current staffing.
<p>
Next, there is the problem of unfunded mandates. Congress, of course, has done something about this. But, frankly, the central problem remains. It seems almost too obvious to point out, but the staggering thing about these mandates is the undemocratic capriciousness of it all. Hardly anyone even dares question the practice. Seldom are we even dealing with specific provisions in the laws Congress has passed.
<p>
Over the years, Congress fell into the habit of enacting grand new laws as confusing in effect as they are high-sounding in name:  the Clean Air Act, the Critical Endangered Species Act, whatever. And then, well, they just left it for the bureaucrats to sort out the details. Not surprisingly, the details invariably turn out to confer greater and greater powers upon the interpreters. Challenged by citizens thrown out of work by their regulations, or in danger of losing their property or seeing its value plummet, these various agencies then seek out like-minded jurists like Judge Muecke. And so, using yet more public money to litigate, they almost always get their way. It is truly an insidious practice. The freedom revolution will not be complete until we put a stop to it once and for all.
<p>
In the long term, we need to scrap the whole irrational regulatory structure that has been dragging our economy down, costing us tens of billions of dollars, and ensnaring countless productive citizens trying to make a decent life for themselves.
<p>
There are tens of thousands of people in Washington whose sole mission in life is to think up and enforce environmental regulations. Between these rule-makers and the ruled, there is a chasm wider than any in the natural world. The folks making policy are too far removed from the folks living under it. If we are serious about reform, we will retain only a very few of these rule-makers, placing statutory limitations on the number of people each agency may employ. What will become of all the others?  Phase them out, buy them out, do whatever it takes. But it is time for them to pack up their knapsacks. Somewhere down the trail lies an honest living.
<p>
That's the long term. In the short term, we should apply a sunset law to all existing federal mandates. After a given period -- say, five years -- all regulations that are not demonstrably protecting the health and safety of the American people should be scrapped.
<p>
And one final reform. In some quarters environmentalism is not merely a cause anymore, but something more resembling a cult. One reason for this is that, at present, some 30 states have laws mandating "environmentally conscious" public school curricula. Arizona had one such law passed in 1990. It required, among other things, that our children be instructed in "environmentally correct behaviors" and in various methods of political activism.
<p>
We changed that law last year, preferring instead educationally conscious public schools, free of political indoctrination. I would urge other states to take a good look at these curricula, which amount to nothing more than another left-wing power play aimed at our children. About the last thing our children need right now are more lessons in airy liberal pieties, ideological half-truths, and cheap sentimentality masquerading as hard science.
<p>
We are critical of the environmental movement of today. But at the same time, there is much good within it. It comes from a very noble impulse. Within it are many sincere and idealistic people. We need such people.
<p>
But at least in its political ranks, I often sense that something is missing from the cause. There is something fearful, grudging, resentful, and deeply pessimistic about environmentalism as we hear it advanced. They forget about human ingenuity, the ability of free people to rise to the problem, to produce more, to be good stewards of the Earth. They forget human nature, which is never quite as blind and grasping and brutal as our more fretful environmentalists seem to assume.
<p>
I guess I prefer the term "stewardship" because it captures both the responsibilities and the opportunities we meet every time we step into nature's province. It captures both sides of human nature -- that side which bows before nature and that side which rises to master it, rises to build homes and cities and lay up stores while still leaving those spaces of quiet in between. I like it, too, because it conveys a little bit more humility than we observe among today's environmentalists. This is the sense of the old saying that God creates and people merely rearrange; that "Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed."
<p>
My friends, these are revolutionary times. On this issue, as elsewhere, the moment has arrived. In place of fear and fretting and false alarms, we must offer a vision of true stewardship -- reclaiming our nation in every sense. It is not a time to be timid. The moment has come to reclaim, all at once, the rich endowment entrusted to America by nature and the freedom entrusted to us by the Founding Fathers.

<title>The Crime Bill's Faulty Math Means a $28 Billion Unfunded Liability to the States -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><I> THE CRIME BILL'S FAULTY MATH MEANS A $28 BILLION UNFUNDED LIABILITY TO THE STATES </i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott A. Hodge</a><br>
Grover M.  Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary
Affairs<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

F.Y.I. No. 29<br>
August 16, 1994<br>
<hr width=-50%></center><p>
 
President Clinton is making a last-ditch effort to revive the $33
billion crime bill that Congress rejected last week on a procedural
vote. Among the arguments Clinton is using to sway lawmakers is the
claim that if Congress passes this measure, the bill's $8.8 billion
Community Policing grant program will add 100,000 new cops to local
police forces over the next six years.
    <P> Clinton is wrong. The numbers just don't add up. The crime bill
provides full funding for only 20,000 permanent new cops. Meanwhile,
it saddles state governments with a $28 billion unfunded liability
over the next six years if the bill is to result in 100,000 new
officers. States such as California and New York will have to raise
some $3 billion each to meet the Administration's promise.
 <P>   The reason this happens is that the Community Policing grant
program is intended only to provide "seed" money to local governments
to hire new police officers, not to fully fund these positions. So the
bill assumes that once these new officers have been hired with
Washington's help, state and local governments will find the billions
of new dollars needed to keep them on permanently. The bill provides
just one-fifth of the funds needed over six years to hire and keep
100,000 new cops on the street in high-crime areas. (For more
information on these calculations, see Scott A.  Hodge, "The Crime
Bill:  Few Cops, Many Social Workers," Heritage Foundation Issue
Bulletin No.  201, August 2, 1994.) Thus, if cities do not cut back on
other services or raise taxes, the funds provided in the bill can keep
at most just 20,000 permanent cops on the street over the six-year
life of the bill. Even more problematic for state and local officials,
if they use federal funding to hire the new police officers and then
cannot raise the funding needed to keep them, officials will have to
start laying off cops after the first year of the bill.
  <P>   Another way to look at this financial sleight-of-hand is to
calculate how much funding the bill provides per police officer per
year. On average, the bill authorizes $1.475 billion per year for
100,000 new officers. This amounts to just $14,750 per cop per year --
roughly the poverty level for a family of four. Police officers
cannot, of course, be hired for minimum wage salaries, and so state
and local governments would have to absorb the remaining cost of
hiring and keeping each of these new cops.
   <P>  To give taxpayers a better understanding of the total cost of the
crime bill, Heritage Foundation analysts have calculated the amount of
new resources states will have to raise over six years if they choose
to apply for the federal Community Policing grants. As is seen in the
following table, these calculations show that state governments will
have to raise a total of over $28 billion of their own funds to meet
Clinton's promise.
 <P>   Eight states (California, New York, Texas, Florida, Illinois, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ohio) will have to absorb more that $1
billion each in new costs over the next six years to fully fund their
share of the 100,000 new cops. At the bottom end of the scale, the
fourteen states likely to receive the minimum amount of federal aid
for new police officers -- and, of course, the fewest number of new
cops at 500 per state -- will still find themselves liable for over
$143 million each in added expenditures to meet the bill's lofty goal.
  <P>   Large states, such California and New York, will be particularly
hard hit. Although California is estimated to receive 10,827 new cops,
it will have to absorb some $3.1 billion in new costs to keep them on
the street. Similarly, New York is estimated to receive 10,407 new
cops but will be burdened by some $3 billion in new costs. Neither of
these states is in the fiscal condition to bear this expense. Texas
could hire nearly 6,400 new officers but would face an unfunded
liability of over $1.8 billion by doing so.
 <P>    In reality, the unfunded liability for some large states will be
even higher than these estimates suggest. This analysis assumes that
the Community Policing grants will be distributed proportionately
according to a state's share of the national police force (see
technical notes in the appendix). But the crime bill allows 75 percent
of the Community Policing funds to be distributed at the discretion of
the Attorney General. This means that the Administration may play
politics with these funds and reward loyal mayors and local
politicians in politically important states -- or House members the
White House needs to win passage of the bill. (Last year, Congress
passed an emergency supplemental bill which included $150 million in
aid to hire 2,000 new police officers.  Nearly 45 percent of these
funds went to four key states:  California, Florida, Illinois, and
Texas.) But, ironically, this will raise the taxpayer liability in
these states even higher. 
   <P>  The dirty little secret of the crime bill is that it will not put
100,000 new police officers on America's streets unless the states
raise taxes or cut other spending to finance a massive $28 billion
unfunded liability. Once most states realize the magnitude of these
new costs it is likely that far fewer permanent cops will actually be
hired. However the computation is made, the result is the same: Bill
Clinton's crime bill actually funds only a fraction of the promised
100,000 new cops.
<P>
     
<B> TECHNICAL NOTES </B><P>
     These calculations have been made using a conservative estimate
of the average cost of hiring and keeping a police officer on the beat
in small and large cities. In small cities, such as Elkhart, Indiana,
the total cost of putting a permanent cop on the beat is $50,000 to
$55,000 per year. In large cities, such as San Francisco, this cost
rises to $70,000 to $75,000. The average used in this analysis is
$62,500. This figure includes salary and fringe benefits, training,
and some administrative costs. It does not include equipment costs
such as police cars and radios. In most cities, a new police cruiser
is needed for every three or four officers hired.
<P>
     This analysis assumes that the Community Policing funds and,
thus, the 100,000 new cops, will be distributed proportionately among
the states according to the current state-by-state distribution of
roughly 534,000 police officers nationwide. The source for these data
is the Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics -- 1992, published by
the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics. 
    <P> The crime bill requires that no state receive less than 0.5
percent of the Community Policing funds. Thus fourteen small states,
whose share of the nation's police force is less than 0.5 percent,
were automatically allotted this minimum share of funds for new
officers. The remaining funds and new cops were then distributed
proportionately among the other states.
   <P>  The federal contribution per state for new cops is based upon the
$14,750 per cop per year the bill authorizes. The state liability is
then based upon the residual amount of $47,750 ($62,500 - $14,750).

SCHOOL CHOICE CONTINUES TO GAIN GROUND 
 <P>   Business leaders and others supporting true education reform can
take heart from the surge of school choice legislation over the past
year.  Whether confined to public schools or expanded to include
private and parochial schools, school choice bills are moving in state
after state.  In fact, choice is the centerpiece of a growing grass
roots challenge to a government-run school system that is failing in
many areas of the country, particularly in America's inner cities.
 <P>   A clear pattern is emerging, according to the annual survey of
school choice measures published recently by The Heritage Foundation.
In 1993, some form of school choice legislation was introduced or
pending in 34 states.  In addition, 33 state governors have indicated
support for some form of school choice, up from 29 in 1992.  And, most
important, at least 35 states have parents' and grassroots' coalitions
working for school choice reforms.  Thus, despite the defeat last
November of Proposition 174, a major school choice initiative in
California (see BEI # 34), and the recent narrow defeat of a school
choice bill in the Arizona legislature, the movement continues to grow
stronger.
<P>     Voucher Programs a Success. Voucher programs passed in earlier
years continued successfully in 1993.  For example, the Wisconsin
state legislature in 1989 introduced a voucher program for Milwaukee
(see BEI # 3).  Currently, 1,000 low-income children can obtain a
voucher worth as much as $2,967 to attend a private school.  Despite
the bitter opposition of education bureaucrats, including the state
school boards association and the teachers unions, the Milwaukee
choice program withstood legal challenges and is forcing changes in
Wisconsin's educational establishment.  
  <P>   Although religious schools have space available in Milwaukee,
only 742 students received vouchers during the 1993-1994 school year
because religious schools are barred from the program and there is not
enough space available in other private schools. To use this space
availability more effectively, Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist and
Wisconsin State Representative Polly Williams have called on state
legislators to increase the number of eligible students  from 1,000 to
5,000. This would be done by letting the students attend not just
secular private schools, but also parochial schools.
  <P>  In addition, the Landmark Legal Foundation, a public interest law
firm, has filed a lawsuit to expand the Milwaukee program. The suit,
on behalf of low-income families in Wisconsin, asks a federal court in
Milwaukee to include parochial schools in the Milwaukee Parental
Choice Program.  Landmark's attorneys claim prohibiting the use of the
vouchers at religious schools is a violation of the plaintiffs'
constitutional right to the free exercise of religion and equal
protection under the law.  
 <P>    The past year also saw the most comprehensive school choice law
yet passed in the United States.  Puerto Rico's Governor Pedro Rosello
signed into law an educational voucher system for the entire territory
of Puerto Rico (see BEI #33). The vouchers, limited to $1,500 each,
offer families the opportunity to choose the public or private school
for their child. The new law also gives high school students the
opportunity to take university-level courses.  While opponents have
challenged the Puerto Rico reform in the courts, school choice
advocates are confident they will prevail.
   <P>  Open enrollment legislation, which gives parents the right to
choose the public school their child will attend, also has been making
headway.  Currently, six states offer "intradistrict open enrollment,"
meaning parents can choose a school within the confines of their
child's school district. Ten states have enacted "interdistrict open
enrollment plans," meaning parents can choose any public school within
the state, not just within their local district.  In addition, seven
states now have voluntary intradistrict plans, and four states have
voluntary interdistrict plans under which school districts can choose
to offer the programs.  And finally, six states have special,
district-based intradistrict plans in which individual cities have
implemented choice programs. 
  <P>  Charter Schools Explosion. Legislation creating chartered,
autonomous public schools is gaining ground, too.  Charter schools are
schools run by teachers, parents, principals, and others outside the
education bureaucracy, and are subject to much less regulation.  Prior
to 1993, two states had enacted charter school legislation: California
and Minnesota.
  <P>   In 1993, thirteen state legislatures considered charter school
legislation or the expansion of existing charter school laws.  Of
these, six states enacted such legislation: Colorado, Georgia,
Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, and Wisconsin.  In early 1994,
Kansas became the ninth state to pass charter school legislation.
Private Voucher Programs Flourish. While legislative reformers were
busy introducing school choice initiatives, many business leaders took
matters into their own hands through private voucher programs. These
privately funded programs are designed to help low-income families
afford the school of their choice for their children.  During the
1993-1994 school year, over 5,000 low-income students have been able
to attend private schools as a result of these efforts.
  <P>   Private scholarship programs were pioneered by businessman Peter
Flanigan of Dillon, Read, & Company (See BEI #6, 9, 30, 34) in 1986.
His "Student-Sponsor Partnership" enabled 725 low-income high school
students in New York to attend private schools in the 1993-94 school
year.
   <P>  Likewise, the Golden Rule Insurance Company's Indianapolis-based
"CHOICE Charitable Trust" scholarship program has been an inspiration
to many corporate and philanthropic charities. Working with other
business groups in Indiana, the Trust helps poor children in
Indianapolis attend private schools  by awarding scholarships covering
up to half their tuition costs. During the 1993-1994 school year, some
1,100 pupils used these vouchers. While the education establishment
has vigorously attacked Golden Rule CEO J. Patrick Rooney, business
and philanthropic organizations see the benefits of the program and
are emulating it.  In 1993, there were eleven private scholarship
programs based on the Golden Rule model, up from five in 1992.  In
addition, at least three other cities are planning to begin similar
programs in September 1994.
  <P>   Public Supports Choice. The growth of school choice initiatives
coincides with strong public support for school choice.  For instance,
in a January 1994 telephone poll of Minnesotans conducted by the
Gordon S. Black Corporation for the Center of the American Experiment
in Minneapolis, Minnesota, some 61% of the respondents favored
introduction of a voucher system.  In addition, 86% of the respondents
supported the interdistrict, public school choice program currently in
place in Minnesota.<P>

LOUISIANA BUSINESS GROUP STRESSES NEED FOR RADICAL REFORM 
 <P>    After a decade of failed reform in the Louisiana school system,
Louisiana business leaders are now calling for radical reform.
According to "Getting There . . . A Better Tomorrow Beginning Today,"
a recent report of the Louisiana Association of Business & Industry,
"Piecemeal attempts to change the present system in Louisiana haven't
worked and won't work.  The present system is a monopoly, and it has
no incentive to change."
<P>     Like other states, Louisiana has poured billions of dollars into
its public elementary and secondary schools. The state spent
approximately 60 percent of its revenues (excluding federal funds) þ
$2.4 billion þ on education in 1991-1992, the latest year for which
figures are available. In addition, the state spent $5.2 million in
1991-1992 on remediation in the elementary and secondary schools, and
another $14 million is spent on remediation in the state's colleges
and universities.
<P>     Despite this level of spending, Louisiana ranked 40th among the
41 states which gave their eighth graders the National Assessment of
Educational Progress (NAEP) math test in 1992.  In addition, a recent
U.S. Department of Education report says  about 58 percent of fourth
graders in the state read below the "basic" level and cannot
understand simple stories.
 <P>    Along with pouring more money into their schools, Louisiana has
lowered its class sizes over the past twenty years.  Between the
1971-1972 and 1991-1992 school years, the number of students in public
schools dropped 12 percent.  Despite this drop in enrollment, the
number of school employees went up 27 percent. Yet, the report states,
"Education in Louisiana is run like a collection of warring fiefdoms þ
each protecting its own turf and seeking more money and power þ after
losing sight of the goal: the education of the people."
  <P>   In order to overcome the inertia of the present bureaucratic
system, the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry recommends
establishing public charter schools and a voucher program which would
allow parents to choose among government and nongovernmental schools. 
<P>

NEW ZEALAND BUSINESS GROUP EDUCATES STUDENTS AND TEACHERS IN BUSINESS
PRINCIPLES 
  <P>   Business leaders' frustration with the lack of general business
knowledge among students is not confined to America. A private group
of business leaders in New Zealand have formed Enterprise New Zealand
Trust.  Its goal: a nationwide program to promote business and
economic education in the schools. According to Ken Baker, Executive
Director of Enterprise New Zealand, "It is now realized that if we are
to improve the standard of living of future New Zealanders, then we
need to be much more enterprising, [and] that we need to develop a
positive attitude towards business . . . . In our schools, we had a
non business culture. School programs operate as though business were
an aberration.  Given their background this is not surprising."
<P>     One of the trust's programs, Enterprise Studies, teaches
entrepreneurial skills to students through contact with local
enterprises, including businesses and volunteer agencies, both as
sources of information and as subjects of study.  After studying
entrepreneurship in the classroom, students are given the chance to
use their new skills by running some form of short-term enterprise.
  <P>   Enterprise New Zealand also instructs teachers and principals in
the principles of entrepreneurship and economics.  These instructional
courses have been extremely helpful in enabling teachers and
principals to apply the techniques of business in the classroom.  One
graduate, Barry Bean, the Principal of Mount Maunganui College,
comments: "I firmly believe that many of the procedures/ methods of
the business world can be transferred to schools.  I am more than
happy to promote the merits of the Principles of Management course to
our local group of Principals."  
<P>

BP House, 20 Customhouse Quay, P. O. Box 892, Wellington, or call

<P>

PRIVATE VOUCHER UPDATE 
 <P>    A recent report from The National Scholarship Center, Just Doing
It: First Annual Survey of the Private Voucher Movement in America,
shows the private voucher movement is picking up momentum all over the
country. According to the report, nearly 5,000 needy elementary and
secondary students are benefitting from one of eleven established
private voucher programs based on the model first developed by the
Golden Rule Insurance Company.  The survey addresses topics ranging
from the number and kinds of schools involved, to the income and other
characteristics of the children and families served, to the
administrative rules and operation of the programs. It gives a
prognosis for the future and lists programs that are likely to be
launched in the 1994-1995 school year.
 <P>    The comprehensive survey is only one of many indications that the
private voucher movement is beginning to receive the attention it
deserves. For instance, Golden Rule, which launched the Educational
CHOICE Charitable Trust program in Indianapolis, Indiana, was among
the 101 companies nationwide selected by members of the United States
Senate and Childhelp USA, a private organization working to combat
child abuse and neglect, to receive special recognition for unique
programs that are helping children and their families to succeed.     
Educational CHOICE Charitable Trust's executive director, Timothy P.
Ehrgott, accepted Golden Rule's award at a Congressional Awards
Luncheon hosted by Senator Orrin Hatch and Congressman Charles Rangel. 
Commented Ehrgott, "We only wish that the CHOICE families could be
with us in Washington.  They are the ones who have made enormous
sacrifices and deserve all the recognition.  We are just pleased to
have been able to help."
  <P>  The private voucher movement has hit even the nation's capital. 
Beginning in the Spring 1994 semester, scholarships became available
for grades K-8 to students who live in the District of Columbia and
are eligible for federally funded (free or reduced-price) school
lunches.  The scholarships are offered by the Washington Scholarship
Fund on a first-come, first-served basis and cover half of private
school tuition, up to a maximum of $1,500.  This semester, 50
scholarships were made available.  
<P>     Contributors to the Washington Scholarship Fund include such
major donors as Applied Energy Systems, the Bradley Foundation, and
business leaders such as Roger Naill, Robert J. Thompson, Randall
Byrnes, Patrick Rooney, and Earle Williams, in addition to a number of
smaller individual donors, including The Heritage Foundation.

PRIVATIZATION SAVES MONEY, REASON STUDY SHOWS  
<P>
     Business managers know that contracting out for certain goods and
services can save money and improve the quality of the final product. 
Unfortunately, most school administrators and local politicians have
yet to learn this lesson.  A recent guide published by the California-
based Reason Foundation, "Making Schools Work:  Contracting Options
for Better Management," finds that many schools pay as much as five
times what private companies pay for the same work in the same area. 
The foundation points out that school administrators can use
innovative management strategies, like contracting out, to stretch
available resources much further.
<P>
     Designed for public school administrators and managers, the guide
describes a wide variety of money-savving contracting options that
could improve both the educational quality and the physical plant of
public schools.  It will help officials decide when, what, and how to
contract with private organizations for services.  It also gives "how
to" guidelines for successful contracting. 
<P>
     According to Reason, most public school privatization occurs in
such areas as transportation, janitorial services, and food services. 
This is especially true for smaller school districts, where the cost
to taxpayers of keeping services "in house" -- which includes the
overhead costs of equipment, salaries, and insurance -- can be
disproportionately expensive.  Companies specializing in a specific
service generally operate on a larger scale and so can spread out
overhead costs, leading to lower prices.  Private contracting also
tends to eliminate the sloppiness and carelessness that often are
found in services operated by the public school system:  a private
company's contract can be terminated for poor performance.
<P>
     There are plenty of examples of successes in the Reason guide. 
In Piscataway, New Jersey, for example, School Superintendent Philip
Geiger privatized bus services in 1991 and cafeteria services in 1992. 
Within one year the transportation costs dropped from $4 million to
$2.5 million, while an estimated $500,000 was saved on food services
in one year.  With that $2 million in savings, says Geiger, "We were
able to redirect funds from noninstructional to instructional uses and
save tax dollars."  With such services delegated to private firms,
school administrators can focus more on what matters most:  educating
children.
<P>
     Privatization can also yield benefits for remedial education,
special education, driver's education, and foreign language
instruction.  Far fewer students enroll in these courses than in basic
courses such as Math and English, and hiring private companies to run
these classes can significantly reduce overall costs.  For example,
Berlitz International, the world-famous firm which offers foreign
language instruction to business executives and tourists, now serves
public schools.  High Tech High School, a magnet school in Hudson
County, New Jersey, contracts with Berlitz to teach Japanese and
Spanish.  Says Principal Karol Brantato, "It's economically feasible
for us....  [W]hat would we have done with a [full-time] Japanese
teacher on staff the rest of the time?  We're very happy with Berlitz,
and I think contracting out is a real viable option for small
programs."
<P>
     Because the needs and abilities of children are unique, some
children require additional assistance.  In Baltimore, Maryland, the
public school system signed a contract in 1993 with Sylvan Learning
Systems for remedial instruction to disadvantaged students in five
public schools.  If a student fails to improve his academic
performance, the company will offer an extra six weeks of remedial
education to the student at no charge to the schools. 
<P>
     One of the most innovative privatizing efforts is contracting out
the supervision of an entire school to a private company, a measure
used in some localities to halt the declining quality of public
education.  The leader in this field has been the Milwaukee-based
Education Alternatives, Inc.  (see BEI 8, 11, 18, 19, 21, 34).  In
June 1991, the firm signed a five-year contract with the Dade County,
Florida school district to operate one of their public schools.  The
company now also runs nine schools in Baltimore, where they in turn
have sub-contracted out to Johnson Controls World Services for
janitorial services.  Budgeted at the average per-pupil cost of the
school district , the company expects to cut administrative costs by
25 percent, redirect those funds into the classroom, and still make a
5 percent profit.  Preliminary results are promising.
<P>
     With growing budget demands,  school administrators are
desperately trying to find ways to cut costs yet still assure quality
education.  Contracting out services often costs less than providing
the service "in house."  It assures direct accountability, and would
be continued only if the school district found the relationship
successful.  Privatization, therefore, could prove to be a vital step
on the road to educational reform.

O'Leary at the Reason Foundation, 3415 S.  Sepulveda Boulevard, Los

CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR NOMINATES BUSINESSMAN AS SUPERINTENDENT 
     <P>
     Governor Pete Wilson of California recently nominated corporate
turnaround specialist Sanford C.  Sigoloff for the post of
Superintendent of Public Instruction, the highest education position
in the state.  If confirmed, Sigoloff will take over from acting
Superintendent of Public Instruction William Dawson.
<P>
     Wilson hopes Sigoloff, Chairman and CEO of Sigoloff and
Associates, a Los Angeles-based consulting firm specializing in the
restructuring and rehabilitation of troubled companies, will apply the
same principles to education he has used in making corporate
California more competitive.  As Wilson says, "Now he [Sigoloff] has a
new customer -- the school children of California -- and these same
principles that helped make corporate America more competitive can be
put to work making our schools more competitive."
<P>
     Sigoloff, who is also an adjunct professor at the John E. 
Anderson Graduate School of Management at the University of
California-Los Angeles, will help school districts around the state
get the most out of taxpayers' dollars.  Declares Wilson, "We can't
afford to waste a single dollar on overhead or administration when we
need every dollar we have in the classroom helping our kids."
<P>
BIGGER DOES NOT EQUAL BETTER 
<P>
     The Chicago-based Heartland Institute warns that students
actually learn less when states, as opposed to local governments, pick
up a larger share of funding for public schools.
<P>
     Their report, "Losing Local Control of Education:  Cost and
Quality Implications," analyzed data for 37 states and the District of
Columbia, evaluating the relationship between student achievement and
school district size, school size, and state share of school funding. 
After controlling for per-pupil expenditures and the socio-economic
status of students, author Herbert J.  Walberg, who is Research
Professor of Education at the University of Illinois at Chicago, finds
that as school governance and funding become more centralized, student
achievement falls.  "The increasing bureaucracy and declining local
accountability that accompany 'remote' spending," writes Walberg,
"have a demonstrably negative effect on student achievement."
<P>
     Walberg shows that centralized funding, school district
consolidation, and a trend toward larger schools has reduced the
influence of parents, educators, and local school boards in
determining school policy.  It has, however, increased the influence
of special interest groups such as the National Education Association. 
The results of centralized governance and funding are all too clear: 
"School spending and school-related tax rates are more likely to
increase and to increase without accountability and improvement in
student learning.  States with such centralized systems are driven by
special interests rather than the public good, which in this case is
effective learning."

RJR NABISCO FOUNDATION BACKS RADICAL REFORM 
<P>
     The Next Century Schools Program, funded by the RJR Nabisco
Foundation, is attempting to stimulate education reform in America. 
After committing nearly $30 million to 42 schools with ideas for
school reform, the RJR Nabisco Foundation recently brought 75
principals, teachers, administrators, and others from across the
United States together for a three-day conference entitled the "China
Breakers Conference."
<P>
     The meeting, part of the Next Century Schools program, recognized
individuals committed to breaking the mold of schooling by channeling
their ideas and energies into the educational mainstream.  The
consensus:  Americans must break some china to enjoy the benefits of
schools that meet the needs of the changing society.  Said former
Chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco, and now IBM CEO, Louis Gerstner: 
"The majority of our public schools are low-tech institutions in a
high-tech world -- bureaucratic dinosaurs lagging behind every
comparable system worldwide."
<P>
     The participants agreed radical reform must take place if America
is going to be competitive in the world economy during the next
century.  Among the recommendations of the conference:  entitle
parents, students, and teachers to greater choice among and within
schools, decentralize school administration, abolish certification,
and establish high, uniform, and demanding standards for students and
teachers.
<P>
     Conferees agreed that real school choice was the most important
ingredient in school reform.  Notes From the Front Lines, the
published highlights of the conference, concludes:  "School choice... 
was the natural, inevitable consequence of the new concept the
participants were struggling to create, a paradigm emphasizing
community, 'smallness' as an educational value and new learning
experiences created by cottage industries.  Greater choice can
stimulate the energy and creativity of parents, students and teachers
that are smothered in today's bureaucratic schools." 
<P>
     Another forthcoming development of the Next Century Schools
project is the forthcoming book, Reinventing Education.  Authored by
IBM chief Gerstner, New American Schools Development Corporation
treasurer Roger Semerad, education analyst Denis Doyle, and William
Johnston, it will emphasize the need for radical reform of America's
education system.  The book warns that "schools cannot be regulated
back into good health," and that only a business (or market-based)
perspective of reforming American public schools will work. 
<P>
     Reinventing Education gives many examples of innovative ideas
used by schools in the Next Century Schools project.  The Downtown
School in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, for instance, is an example
of what a school can accomplish when unencumbered by existing notions
of schools.  The Downtown School is located in a former public market,
near a corporate complex.  The children of nearby workers are given
enrollment priority.  These workers must agree to help out at the
school at least one hour per week as a condition of enrolling their
children.  As an increasing number of parents work outside the home,
the close ties between schools and workplace become more important.
<P>
     The Next Century Schools project is at the forefront of reforming
the American education system.  Only by breaking through the current
mindset that accepts the status quo will American business make a real
difference in education.

BUSINESSMAN GIVES EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO POOR CHILDREN 
<P>
     Patrick F.  Taylor, owner of Taylor Energy Company of New
Orleans, is among the growing band of business leaders who are giving
educational opportunities to low-income youngsters.
<P>
     Taylor's commitment to the education of poor youngsters began in
1988 after he addressed 180 twice-failed, minority, single-parent
seventh- and eighth-grade students at Livingston Middle School in East
New Orleans.  At the time, many of these students planned to drop out
of school after the eighth grade.  But by serving as a role model and
encouraging these children, Taylor has helped many of them enter
college.
<P>
     One of Taylor's major efforts, Project New Orleans, gives $1,000
in personal expense money per year to each student in Orleans Parish
who qualifies for a Pell Grant and is enrolled in a Louisiana college. 
The program, which has been in effect since 1990, helps students with
necessary funds for transportation, books, clothing, lab fees, and
other classroom materials or incidental expenses.
<P>
     According to Taylor, Project New Orleans is aimed at inner-city
children because of their high dropout rates, ranging from 45 percent
to 60 percent, and because, he says, many have no hope of a future
"beyond crime, poverty or welfare."  The extra help is critical: 
"While a waiver of tuition and fees would assist them in college, many
do not have additional finances to buy books, pay for transportation
or other incidentals necessary during their college career."  Taylor
has thus far convinced eighteen New Orleans companies to invest over
$2 million in this program.
<P>

Company, 234 Loyola Avenue, Suite 500, New Orleans, LA 70112, (504)

MICHIGAN ENACTS CHARTER SCHOOL LEGISLATION 
<P>
     Governor John Engler and the Michigan legislature recently took a
step toward reforming Michigan's troubled education system.  Following
the landmark legislative decision last year to eliminate all state
property taxes earmarked for schools (see BEI #33), Engler and his
allies in the state legislature worked successfully to pass some of
his educational reform agenda.  The centerpiece is charter school
legislation, which enables existing public schools, community
colleges, and universities to set up schools.  Michigan is the eighth
state to establish charter schools.  The others are California,
Colorado, Georgia, Minnesota, New Mexico, Massachusetts, and
Wisconsin. 
<P>
     Under the legislation, no limitation is set on who may propose to
create an "academy," or charter school, but only existing public
schools, community colleges, or public universities are authorized to
organize and operate one or more public academies.   To ensure
accountability, charter schools must take the MEAP (Michigan Education
Assessment Program) test or any national assessment test.  The
Governor's allies won a major battle against Outcome-Based Education
proponents by inserting a provision that the MEAP test could not test
for values.  In addition, there is no teacher tenure in an "academy"
school, and in a related bill, the legislature made it easier for
qualified people without a teaching degree to become certified through
an accelerated program.
<P>
     Citizen groups in Michigan are also trying to eliminate the
state's constitutional ban against private school choice.  Clearly,
Michigan's education reform has just begun.

     <P>

     
ALL ADULTS LACK BASIC WORK SKILLS 
<P>
     A recent study by the Department of Education presents a bleak
picture of the nation's literacy.  According to the four-year study,
nearly half of America's 191 million adult citizens cannot write a
coherent letter about a billing error or calculate the length of a bus
trip from a bus schedule.
<P>
     Like other studies on literacy, the new government report says
that about 10 percent of all adult Americans admit they have
difficulty reading and writing.  But this study gives a more detailed
picture of America's literacy problem than previous reports have done,
since it takes into account how well people understand English.  The
study also includes questions requiring competence in addition and
subtraction.
<P>
     The price of illiteracy is borne chiefly by businesses and their
employees.  Business leaders estimate a $25 billion to $30 billion
loss per year in productivity because of errors attributable to poor
literacy.  Needless to say, the business community was not surprised
about the results of the recent study.  Said Brenda Bell, vice
president of marketing for the National Alliance of Business, "We have
estimated that only about 25 percent of the adult population is highly
literate."
<P>
     A growing number of companies are trying to address illiteracy
through worker training programs.  Many form partnerships with local
community colleges, where professors come to offices and factories to
help workers learn basic skills.
<P>
     But while businesses are pouring billions of dollars into
workforce training and education programs, they still have very little
to show for their efforts.  Madeleine M.  Kunin, Deputy Secretary of
Education, worries that "We simply are not keeping pace with the kinds
of skills required in today's economy."  More and more business
leaders are concluding that trying to solve the literacy problem at
the workplace is starting too late, and that the education system
needs genuine systemic change.

<P>
SPEAKER'S CORNER 
 <P>
Despite rhetoric to the contrary, a lack of money has not been
responsible for the decline in educational achievement for the last
ten years.  Consider the facts:  
<P>
      
Total spending by all levels of government on education in 1993 was
$493.3 billion.  
<P>
Total spending on education, after adjusting for inflation, has risen
over 50 percent since 1983.  
<P>
      
The proportion of the United States' gross domestic product spent on
education rose from 6.7 percent in 1983 to 7.9 percent in 1993.

<h3> CHOICE IN EDUCATION: PART II - 
LEGAL PERILS AND LEGAL OPPORTUNITIES </h3>
By Clint Bolick<br>
Director, Landmark Legal Foundation's Center for Civil Rights <p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 809<br>
February 18, 1991<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<P> 


   Americans increasingly are turning to reforms based on
parental choice of schools as the best solution to America's education
crisis. (The choice options available and efforts across the nation to
promote education choice are discussed in Choice in Education:  Part
I -- How Choice Works, Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.  760,
March 21, 1990.  (Also available in Spanish as "Manual Sobre la
Libertad de Elegir Escuela, Parte I:  Como Funciona la Opci>n",
Translation No.  37, October 10, 1990.) Since Part I was released,
significant developments include the nation's first private school
"voucher" law in Wisconsin and an Oregon initiative that would have
provided state income tax credits for students who opt out of public
schools.) 
<P>	In New York City's East Harlem, for example, granting
parents a choice of public schools has boosted that district's student
achievement from last to sixteenth among the city's 32 school districts. 
Wisconsin last year enacted legislation allowing 1,000 low-income
Milwaukee youngsters to use state education funds for tuition in
private schools.  The tiny New Hampshire town of Epsom took a
giant step for choice by adopting the nation's first property tax
abatement to encourage parents to pursue education alternatives
outside public schools.  And in Chicago, 27 low-income parents and
children filed a lawsuit demanding the opportunity to opt out of
abysmal public schools.
<P>
		While political support has been growing for
educational choice, a number of legal questions concerning choice
remain as serious impediments.  Most recently, a Wisconsin court of
appeals struck down that state's choice program on a procedural
technicality, although the program is continuing pending appeal to the
Wisconsin Supreme Court.
<P>
		Two clear lessons emerge from the litigation against
choice programs: <P>
 1) That any ambitious education choice program that includes
private schools will be challenged vigorously in the courts by the
public school administrators and teacher organizations who feel most
threatened by competition from the private sector; and
<P>
2) That choice programs that are carefully crafted and aggressively
defended stand a good chance of surviving such legal challenges.
   Advocates of choice in education thus should recognize that a
sound legal framework and strategy are essential to success.  In
designing education choice programs, therefore, policy makers should
study the record of federal and state court challenges to choice and
ensure their proposals satisfy several essential criteria.  Among them:
The program should not discriminate in favor of religiously affiliated
schools;
<P>
The program should place the decision of where funds are used in the
hands of individual students and parents; and
<P>
The program should not create a permanent and pervasive state
influence in religiously affiliated schools.
Litigation may be a major weapon in the anti-choice arsenal, but it
can be neutralized by a thorough understanding of the law by
advocates of choice.  Indeed, the legal weapon even can be used to
choice's advantage.

<P>
THE POTENTIAL LEGAL HURDLES FACING CHOICE PLANS 
<P>
   The principal potential legal obstacles to education choice are
federal anti-discrimination requirements and the "establishment"
clause of the First Amendment.  In addition, state constitutions and
statutes may present problems that prompt legal challenges to choice
programs.
<P>
		These potential obstacles do not mean, of course, that
education choice proposals are unlawful.  On the contrary, most
choice programs, regardless of how broad they are, can pass legal
muster if they are carefully crafted.  What choice proponents need to
do to achieve success is to give very thorough consideration to legal
ramifications in designing their programs.  This requires no sacrifice
of basic policy objectives.  Since choice necessarily expands
educational opportunities and parental control, which are values
deeply embedded in America's constitutional tradition, any legal
challenge will at worst present no more than a conflict between
competing constitutional values, from which a well-designed choice
program should emerge intact.

<P>
1) Discrimination
<P>
   Critics of education choice often contend that it will promote
segregation.  This claim draws upon the history of schemes in the
1960s that were devised to evade the requirement to desegregate
public schools.  Such schemes led the Supreme Court to rule in 1968
that "freedom of choice" plans could present constitutional difficulties
if they were designed to perpetuate discrimination. (Green v.  County
School Board of New Kent County, 391 U.S.  430 (1968).)
<P>		Today's choice proposals, of course, have no such
discriminatory intent.  Their objective is not to avoid integration, but
to expand educational opportunities.  Indeed, one argument raised by
opponents of the Oregon ballot initiative that was defeated at the
polls last November and would have allowed both public and private
school choice was that it would have allowed black youngsters to
attend white schools in the suburbs.  Choice programs, in fact, are
likely to be of most benefit to economically disadvantaged youngsters
in the inner city, who are predominantly from minority ethnic groups. 
Private schools in the inner city, moreover, are often more racially
diverse than public schools. (See, e.g., Clint Bolick, Changing Course: 
Civil Rights at the Crossroads (New Brunswick, N.J.:  Transaction
Books, 1988), p.  108.)
<P>
		Nonetheless, choice programs must comport with the
applicable state and federal nondiscrimination requirements.  Federal
law, for instance, prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or
handicap in any programs or activities receiving federal assistance.  In
the 1984 Grove City  case, the Supreme Court ruled that even federal
scholarship aid funnelled directly to students exposes private schools
to regulatory coverage. (Grove City College v.  Bell, 465 U.S.  555
(1984).)  Under such circumstances, federal law now provides that the
entire educational institution -- and not just the portion of the
program receiving federal aid -- is subject to federal regulation.
<P>
		The precise scope of federal nondiscrimination
regulations has never been fully defined, however, in the context of
federal or state funding of non-public education through tuition
reimbursement (vouchers) or tax credits.  The threshold requirement
that triggers these regulations is that the schools are "recipients" of
federal funding, a rather vague term that usually is broadly construed. 
In practice, the likelihood of federal regulatory coverage depends on
whether federal funds are included in the choice program.  It might
also depend on whether the program involves direct payments to the
schools, or vouchers (which normally would trigger regulation), or
indirect aid in the form of reduced tax liability to parents (which may
not). 
<P>
		 A recent opinion letter by the U.  S.  Department of
Education, (Letter to Governor Tommy G.  Thompson from Assistant
Secretaries of Education Robert R.  Davila and Michael Williams
(undated).) confirms that to the extent private schools in choice
programs are deemed recipients of federal funds, some regulations
would apply. (The regulations in some instances apply special,
less-onerous provisions to private schools.  See, e.g., 34 C.F.R.  104.39
(rules for private school regarding nondiscrimination on the basis of
handicap).)  These regulations consist typically of general
nondiscrimination requirements, which most private schools easily
satisfy.  The letter concludes, however, that more onerous statutes
would not apply to choice programs, such as the Education of the
Handicapped Act (EHA), (20 U.S.C.  1400, et seq.) a federal grant
program that obligates states to provide extensive special services and
programs to severely handicapped children.
<P>
		States may also have nondiscriminatory requirements
that apply to recipients of public funds.  Any program that provides
for direct payment of state funds to private schools would likely
trigger such requirements.
<P>
		The Lessons. Because of the uncertainty concerning the
applicability of federal anti-discrimination requirements, lawmakers
would be wise to make sure that the statutory language creating a
choice program involving the payment of public funds to private
schools should be accompanied by a general requirement of
nondiscrimination on the basis of race, sex, or handicap.  Although
the precise parameters of such obligations will have to await future
court decisions, the inclusion of a general non-discrimination mandate
will increase the odds of a successful defense of choice plans.
<P>
2) Desegregation
<P>
   A related issue is desegregation.  By allowing parents to
choose the best schools for their children regardless of racial
composition, the effect of education choice on efforts to attain racial
balance is uncertain.  This leads some critics to argue that choice is
discriminatory. 
<P>
		 The opposite is true.  Choice can provide the financial
means to afford equal educational opportunities to all of America's
children. (See, e.g., Bolick, Changing Course, p.  104-112.)  In
particular, choice plans targeted to inner-city low-income youngsters
can provide educational benefits that decades of forced busing have
failed to produce.
<P>
	    The issue of desegregation may arise in many statewide
choice plans since a number of ongoing court orders involving
desegregation remain in effect.  But the Supreme Court's decision last
month in the Oklahoma City busing case suggests that school districts
have wide latitude to adopt programs that are in the educational
interest of their school children, even if it means less racial balance.
(Board of Education of Oklahoma City Public Schools vs.  Dowell,
No.  89-1080 (Jan 15, 1991).)  Meanwhile, in jurisdictions in which no
desegregation orders are in effect, plaintiffs challenging a choice law
must prove it was adopted with discriminatory intent.  This is a very
difficult standard to meet. (Washington v.  Davis, 426 U.S.  229
(1976).  This standard does not apply if the state itself is obligated
under a desegregation order.)
<P>
		The Lessons.  To reduce the probability of challenge,
choice plans should be designed to ensure that they provide equal
opportunity.  A requirement of nondiscrimination should accompany
programs in which direct payments are made to private schools.  In
tuition tax credit programs, provisions should be included to allow
low-income families to participate.  Though such provisions are not
legally mandatory, they will help defuse arguments that the program
is designed to benefit only those who can already afford private
schools.
<P>
		Most choice programs will help most significantly those
who now lack choice -- mainly low-income families whose children
attend the worst schools.  Against this real-world backdrop, claims of
discrimination mounted by the public education establishment and its
allies are likely to ring hollow in courtrooms.

<P>
3) The Religion Conundrum 
<P>
   When an education choice program extends to religiously
affiliated schools, opponents will raise objections ostensibly based on
the "establishment" clause of the First Amendment.  Most well-crafted
education choice programs, however, should survive this legal thicket. 
But the journey through the thicket can be challenging.
<P>
		Although the First Amendment's language is simple --
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion"
-- its application is extremely complex.  A common sense
interpretation of the clause would not suggest any difficulty.  Aid to
parents who wish to send their children to religiously affiliated
schools does not "establish" religion.  Yet this is not the way in which
the clause is applied by courts.
<P>
		The U.S.  Supreme Court's decisions regarding the
clause are confusing and contradictory since the Court for years has
been divided bitterly over establishment clause issues.  In 1989, for
instance, the Court decided that a religious creche inside a county
courthouse violates the clause while a Chanukah menorah displayed
with a Christmas tree outside a government office building does not;
this decision, moreover, elicited five different opinions from the nine
justices. (County of Allegheny v.  ACLU Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,
109 S.Ct.  3086 (1989).)  Prospects for successful defense of education
choice programs before the Supreme Court have increased with the
resignation of Justice William Brennan, who was the Court's strongest
critic of the use of public funds in religiously affiliated schools. 
Although the outcome of any particular case is by no means certain,
the Court's new composition and its relevant precedents suggest that
bona fide education choice programs will withstand constitutional
scrutiny even if they involve sectarian schools.
<P>
		The Supreme Court has constructed three tests for
"establishment clause" cases, under which the challenged legislation
must satisfy each.  The legislation:<P>
1) Must serve a secular legislative purpose;
<P>
2) In its "primary effect" must neither advance nor inhibit religion;
and
<P>
3) Must not foster an "excessive entanglement" between government
and religion. (Lemon v.  Kurtzman, 403 U.S.  602, 612-613 (1971).)
   The first part of this test is easily satisfied in education cases
by the state's interest in a well-educated citizenry. (See, e.g., Mueller
v.  Allen, 463 U.S.  388, 395 (1983).)  The second and third tests,
however, often collide in what Supreme Court Chief Justice William
Rehnquist describes as a "'Catch-22' of [the Court's] own creation,... 
whereby aid [to sectarian schools] must be supervised to ensure no
entanglement but the supervision itself is held to be an
entanglement," a result "far afield from the concerns which prompted
adoption of the First Amendment." (Aguilar v.  Felton, 473 U.S.  402,
420-421 (1985)(Rehnquist, J., dissenting).)
<P>
		Cases involving aid to religiously affiliated schools or to
parents who patronize them have run an erratic course.  The Court,
for example, upheld a program that reimbursed parents for school
transportation expenses, including those incurred in connection with
sectarian schools, (Everson v.  Board of Education, 330 U.S.  1
(1947).) but it struck down policies reimbursing nonpublic schools for
the costs of teacher salaries, textbooks, instructional materials, and
teacher-prepared examinations. (Lemon v.  Kurtzman, op.  cit.; Levitt
v.  Committee for Public Education, 413 U.S.  472 (1973).)  Similarly,
it invalidated a direct loan of instructional materials to nonpublic
schools, while upholding textbook loans to individual students. (Meek
v.  Pittenger, 421 U.S.  349 (1975); Wolman v.  Walter, 433 U.S.  229
(1977).)
<P>
  	  The dividing lines in the Supreme Court are best seen
in three cases.  In the first of these, the 1983 Mueller v.  Allen
decision, the Court upheld by a five to four vote a Minnesota tax
deduction program that provides state income tax benefits for various
educational expenses incurred in public or private schools, including
tuition in religiously affiliated schools.  The majority found it relevant
that the credit was only one facet of the state's overall program to
achieve an equitable distribution of the tax burden; that the credit
was available to defray expenses in all schools, public or private; and
that the only contact the state had with religious schools was to
ensure that textbooks for which credits were claimed did not advance
religious doctrine.  The Court emphasized that the program did not
impermissibly advance religion because "aid to parochial schools is
available only as a result of decisions by individual parents." (Mueller
v.  Allen, op.  cit., p.  399.)
<P>
		The second decision was handed down two years later,
in Aguilar v.  Felton.  The Court struck down on a five to four vote
the use by New York City of federal remedial education funds to pay
public school employees to teach educationally deprived low-income
students on-site in the parochial schools the children attended.  The
Court held the First Amendment was violated since public aid was
funneled into a "pervasively sectarian environment," which required a
"permanent and pervasive state influence" to protect against the use
of public funds for religious indoctrination.
<P>
		The third significant decision was the 1986 Witters v. 
Department of Services for the Blind, (474 U.S.  481 (1986).) in
which the Court ruled unanimously that public funds for the
vocational training of the blind could be used at a Bible college for
ministry training.  The Court found several aspects of the program
relevant to its holding.  The use of funds depended on the decisions
of individual students.  The funds were available for public or private
schools.  The program created no financial incentive to attend
parochial schools.  And there was no evidence that a substantial
portion of the funds would flow to religious education.  The decision
in Witters suggests that in future the Court will not subject voucher-
type arrangements (as in Witters) to more stringent scrutiny than tax
deductions (as in Mueller) as long as the use of funds depends on the
independent decisions of parents or students.
<P>
		A separate opinion in Witters by former Justice Lewis
Powell, which may now represent the majority opinion of the Court,
declared that "state programs that are wholly neutral in offering
educational assistance to a class defined without reference to religion
do not violate the second part of the Lemon v.  Kurtzman test."
(Ibid., p.  490-491 (Powell, J., concurring).)  If this standard were
adopted in a majority opinion of the Court, it would sustain all bona
fide education choice programs that do not discriminate in favor of
religiously affiliated schools and which do not create excessive
entanglement between the state and such schools.  In this area as
well, state constitutions may contain provisions that extend beyond
the restrictions of the First Amendment, and choice proposals should
take these into account.
<P>
		The Lessons.  The Supreme Court's record on choice
cases suggests three principles to guide policy makers in crafting
education choice programs:<P>
1) The program should not discriminate in favor of religiously
affiliated schools;
<P>
2) The program should place the decision of where the funds are
used in the hands of individual students and parents; and
<P>
3) The program should not create a permanent and pervasive state
influence in religiously affiliated schools.<P>
   If an education choice program satisfies each of these three
criteria, it likely will survive a challenge under the U.S.  Constitution. 
In this area as well, state constitutions may contain provisions that
extend beyond the restrictions of the First Amendment, and choice
proposals should take these into account. 
<P>
		 While there can be no guarantees with respect to these
legal issues -- except that any meaningful education choice program
will have to endure a lengthy legal battle -- the odds appear to favor
a triumph for well-crafted, well-defended programs designed to
expand choice in education.
<P>
CONCLUSION:  PROSPECTS FOR SUCCESS
<P>
   The prognosis for choice in education is good precisely
because the monopoly public school system is so bad.  Americans
increasingly recognize that it is impossible to progress and prosper as
a nation as long as children are consigned to a defective public school
monopoly.  This understanding is gaining adherents where it counts
the most:  in the statehouses, in the business community, and
especially among parents. (See John E.  Chubb and Terry M.  Moe,
Politics, Markets and America's Schools (Washington, D.C.:  The
Brookings Institution, 1990).)
<P>
		Support is growing, particularly among low-income
people of all races, for whom alternatives to public schools could be
the difference between a life of poverty or a chance for success.  As a
result, parental choice is a key facet in the movement toward
"empowerment" -- policies designed to remove arbitrary barriers to
opportunity and thereby to provide low-income Americans greater
control over their own destinies.
<P>
		The anti-choice forces are determined and powerful. 
They resist choice at every possible opportunity:  in the policy arena,
in the legislature, at the ballot box, and in the courtroom.  But as the
benefits of choice grow more apparent and the need grows more
urgent, the anti-choice forces will encounter far more battles than
ever before.
<P>
		In the fight for parental choice, litigation is both an
obstacle and a potential weapon.  Those who support expanded
educational opportunities through choice should not shy from
courtroom battle, but instead should approach the task intelligently
and with commitment.  The results will be worth the effort.
Appendix Current  and  Recent  Cases  Involving  School  Choice

<P>

1) The Milwaukee Parental Choice Program
<P>
   Proponents of education choice can draw some important
lessons from the litigation surrounding this program, which was
enacted by the Wisconsin legislature in spring 1990. (The author
represents low-income parents and private schools who are
participating in the program in defending the program against legal
challenge.)
<P>
		The program provides approximately $2,500 to private,
nonsectarian schools, to reimburse tuition costs for up to 1,000 low-
income children in Milwaukee.  Participating schools must comply
with health and safety codes and nondiscrimination requirements, and
must satisfy at least one of four performance standards (such as
parental participation and student achievement).  The schools may
accept up to 49 percent of their students from those participating in
the choice program, who are admitted on a random basis.  The
schools must provide certain financial and performance data.  The
program is the first choice program in the nation to pay full costs of
education in private schools.
<P>
		The public education establishment opened a two-front
attack against the choice program.  The teachers' unions, joined by
the Milwaukee chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, (The black community in
Milwaukee, including all state legislators, the community newspapers,
and the overwhelming majority of citizens, strongly supports the
choice program.  See, for example, Mikel Holt, "Civil Rights Center
Enters Parental Choice Suit," Milwaukee Community Journal June 6,
1990, p.1.) filed a lawsuit challenging the program as unconstitutional
under Wisconsin law. (The Wisconsin chapter of the National
Education Association claims the program is unconstitutional since it
is insufficiently regulated, it does not obligate the private schools to
the requirements applicable to public schools, and it was passed as
part of the budget bill.  No federal constitutional claims were raised
since the program does not include religiously affiliated schools.) 
Meanwhile, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Herbert
Grover attempted to impose a wide array of regulations on the
private schools, including special education requirements of the
Education for the Handicapped Act, all federal constitutional rights
of students, and all standards applicable to public schools (such as
teacher certification and special programs).  Such bureaucratic
mandates could have bankrupted the private schools, and at the very
least would have transformed them into institutions differing only in
name from public schools.
<P>
		To salvage the choice program, the parents and schools
moved to intervene as defendants in the teachers' union lawsuit, and
filed their own lawsuit challenging the superintendent's regulations. 
One complication for the parents was that the state attorney general
was hampered in his ability to defend the statute, both because he
also had to defend the superintendent's regulations and because the
superintendent publicly (and in court) opposed the choice plan. 
<P>
		 Eventually, the lawsuits were consolidated, and the
state circuit court in Madison ruled in favor of the parents on all
issues.  In November, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals ruled the
program unconstitutional on a procedural technicality:  the law was
enacted as part of a budget bill rather than a free-standing bill.  The
case is on appeal to the State Supreme Court.  Meantime, the choice
program is operational, providing high-quality educational
opportunities to several hundred economically disadvantaged children.
<P>
The Wisconsin experience makes clear that the battle
for choice programs will not be easy.  The education establishment
will devote enormous resources to challenge choice programs in
court, often on technicalities.  But the fight also suggests that parents
are in the best position to resist such efforts as full participants in the
courtroom.

<P>
2) Kansas City
<P>
   Creative advocates may find that education choice is not so
much a legal problem as a legal solution.  In a variety of contexts --
from desegregation to unequal educational funding to unsafe schools
to infringement of religious liberty -- allowing students to opt out of
public schools and take their share of educational tax dollars with
them can provide a workable remedy for a wide range of legal
problems facing the public schools.
<P>
		One such effort is taking place in Kansas City, where a
federal court over the past several years has invoked a variety of
costly and coercive measures in an unsuccessful effort to achieve
racial balance among students.  A group of students responded by
filing a suit in 1989 demanding the opportunity to use their tax dollars
in well-integrated private schools. (See Patricia King, "When
Desegregation Backfires," Newsweek, July 31, 1989, p.  56.)  If the
case succeeds, it could provide the first voucher remedy in a school
desegregation context -- and thereby help students attain the equal
educational opportunities that decades of failed busing have not
achieved.

<P>
3) Chicago
<P>
   In Illinois, 27 low-income parents and children, along with the
education reform coalition TEACH America (a division of the City
Club of Chicago), filed papers in Cook County Circuit Court last
December demanding the right to use their share of state education
tax dollars in private schools. (See Amy Stuart Wells, "Chicago
Parent's Suit Adds New Twists to Voucher Issue," New York Times,
December 19, 1990.)
<P>
		The voucher proponents are attempting to join a suit
filed the previous month by 47 Illinois school districts, who are
challenging the state's system of education financing and seeking
massive tax increases.  This lawsuit is the latest in a long line of "tax
equity" lawsuits that have led to increased funding but few
educational benefits.  Recent tax equity lawsuits were successful in
New Jersey, Texas, and Kentucky. ("Rich Schools, Poor Schools,"
Washington Post, October 14, 1898, p.  A22.)
<P>
		Both the school districts and the parents argue that the
state is failing to ensure an "efficient" and "high-quality" system of
education as guaranteed by the Illinois Constitution.  But the
remedies sought -- more funding versus parental choice -- pit against
one another two dramatically different visions for the future of
education.

<P>
4) Tennessee
<P>
   Another potentially fruitful prospect for voucher remedies is in
the area of religious liberty.  In Mozert v.  Hawkins County Public
Schools, (647 F.  Supp.  1194 (E.D.  Tenn.  1986) and slip opinion
(E.D.  Tenn.  Dec.  18, 1986), reversed, 827 F.2d 1058 (6th Cir. 
1987), cert.  denied, 108 U.S.  1029 (1988).) a group of parents in
Tennessee challenged the selection of textbooks by the county school
board as an infringement of their religious beliefs.  But rather than
seeking to ban or replace the books, the parents sought to opt out of
the public schools and to take their tax dollars with them.  In a
landmark ruling, the trial court agreed.  Although the court of
appeals overturned the ruling on other grounds, vouchers may provide
a workable remedy in similar cases.
<P>

5) Possible Future Suits
<P>
	  Lawsuits involving issues of choice are likely to proliferate. 
The recently passed tax abatement ordinance in Epsom, New
Hampshire, is subject to likely legal challenge. (See, e.g., Fox
Butterfield, "Tax Rebate in New Hampshire Town Poses Test For
School Choice Issue," New York Times, January,  1991, p.  B6.) 
Meanwhile, choice advocates are likely to find more opportunities to
seek voucher remedies in litigation.  Far from judicial "activism," as
some conservative attorneys wrongly suppose, vouchers are nothing
more than money damages for failure to provide a service -- the most
commonplace judicial remedy.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT></B> tiny "Great Books" college in California, tucked away in a mountain meadow, 
would seem an unlikely minuteman in a struggle for the academic liberty of America's 
colleges, universities, and professional schools. But so it is. Thomas Aquinas College, 
named for the 13th-century Italian saint and patron of Catholic education, was among the 
first to resist the imposition of non-academic standards by regional accrediting agencies. 
Now the accreditors, who grant a scholastic seal of approval--and with it, access to 
federal assistance--are hoping to consolidate and centralize their power over dissident 
institutions.</P>
<P>	Armed with an agenda that includes politically correct notions of "diversity," an 
alliance of accreditors and Washington-based educrats is trying to establish a national 
accrediting body that would oversee every institution of higher learning in the country. 
No school that receives federal money would be immune from attack: By threatening to 
withhold accreditation, and thereby close off millions of dollars in government loans and 
other assistance, a centralized body could impose a political agenda at will.</P>
<P>	This is precisely the lesson in the recent flap over the Accreditation Council for 
Graduate Medical Education, which insisted that medical schools require training in 
abortion procedures or else forfeit accreditation.</P>
<P>	If the move toward a centralized accrediting body succeeds, the private, collegial 
character of the review process will be in peril. Advocates of diversity and multicultural 
standards instead will be pitted against institutions striving to preserve high academic 
standards along with their own distinctive missions. The autonomy and quality of these 
institutions will be put in jeopardy.</P>
<P>	This is not a hypothetical fear. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical 
Education, a nationwide agency, recently voted for ideological reasons to deny 
accreditation to any obstetrics and gynecology program that fails to provide mandatory 
training in abortion procedures. A similar imposition of ideological mandates could occur 
if accreditation of colleges were centralized in one monopolistic organization.</P>
<P>	Accreditation has long been a valuable process in higher education. Until recently, 
it has involved private, professional peer review to make sure that colleges and 
universities actually provide the quality of education they claim to provide. Now 
proponents of "diversity" are using the process to impose politically correct educational 
standards on institutions striving to preserve their distinctive missions. In the name of 
advancing diversity within each institution, they are imposing their own version of 
conformity and threatening true diversity among institutions. At stake is America's 
historical commitment to the integrity, quality, and independence of its colleges.</P>

<H3>The Aquinas Model</H3>
<P>  Since its founding in 1971, Thomas Aquinas has offered only one kind of degree: a 
bachelor of arts in liberal education. Our curriculum is composed of the seminal books of 
Western civilization, and we are unabashedly Catholic. There are no majors, minors, or 
electives. There are no textbooks; we rely only on the original works of those who have 
thought deeply about man, nature, and God. There are no lectures; we hold seminars in 
which professors guide students toward an understanding of the authors before them. 
With its clear and distinctive academic vision, the college offers an exemplary version of 
a classical liberal education.</P>
<P>	We pursue no "affirmative action" for persons or texts. We look for the best 
teachers, the best books, and students willing and able to undertake the life of reason. As 
Catholics, we hold that one intellectual tradition is superior, and we ask our students to 
study in that tradition, as well as to read prominent critics of that tradition such as Marx 
and Nietzsche. We are not about the study of "culture," as the word is used today; we will 
not base our curriculum on authors consciously selected for their race, gender, or sexual 
orientation. Whether the author is St. Thomas or Machiavelli, however, we are studying 
not the man, but what he has to say about the true, the beautiful, and the good.</P>
<P>	Until the 1980s, schools such as Thomas Aquinas thrived under the nation's six 
regional accrediting agencies for senior colleges and universities. These accreditors 
respected their members' independence and judged them in light of their professed 
missions. Countries like France, with their centralized ministries of education, would not 
allow such an enterprise as this. America does, thanks to its tradition of non-
governmental accreditation.</P> 
<P>	The latest mutation in the accreditation process is a story that we at Thomas 
Aquinas College know only too well. Every college and university in the United States 
must periodically submit to a review by one of these private accrediting agencies. 
Without accreditation, schools lose academic credibility among their peers.</P>
<P>	The process in the United States has always been largely in the hands of private 
organizations of accredited schools. After World War II, however, the G.I. Bill and the 
growth of federal aid programs prompted the agencies to take on the additional role of 
approving colleges as the recipients of such funds. And as the gatekeepers of federal 
funds, the agencies in turn had to be approved by the U.S. Department of Education.</P>
<P>	As schools became more dependent upon federal funds, the character of the 
accrediting agencies gradually changed. Control over funds gave them great leverage 
over colleges and universities. They became less collegial associations of institutions that 
testify publicly to the worthiness of a college, and more the rulers and regulators of these 
institutions. Now they are threatening to become the guardians of an ideological agenda 
and to advocate diversity standards and politically-correct curricula.</P>

<H3>Diversity over Quality</H3>
<P>	By 1988, with the rise of multiculturalism in academia, the threat was emerging in 
California. Our accreditor, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), 
began promoting more prescriptive standards. These included the following language: 
"The institution demonstrates its commitment to the increasingly significant role played 
by diversity of ethnic, social, and economic backgrounds among its members by making 
positive efforts to foster such diversity."</P>
<P>	Stephen Weiner, the executive director of WASC, wrote in the Chronicle of 
Higher Education that WASC's expectations for diversity "affect virtually every aspect 
of campus life, and, therefore, each of our accrediting standards." In one document, the 
new diversity policy is called "the cornerstone of a major new thrust." In other words, 
standards of integrity and academic quality no longer would form the sole basis for 
accreditation.</P>
<P>	The new policy was part of a national movement among accreditors to leverage 
their influence over federal funds on behalf of the cause of diversity. Specifically, the 
accreditors wanted to mandate race and gender preferences in hiring and admissions, as 
well as multiculturalism in the curriculum, on the grounds that they are intrinsic to 
academic quality.</P>
<P>	Colleges and universities began to worry about accreditation's new thrust. This 
concern was not without foundation. One school discovered that WASC evaluators were 
soliciting racial grievances from the faculty of a neighboring college. Another was told, 
in writing, that it had "failed to grasp the concept of diversity" and that its curricula 
would have to be "restructured." A third was ordered to alter the composition of its board 
of trustees and told that a religious profession required of its faculty was "not in 
conformity with [WASC's] expectations."</P>
<P>	Colleges where multiculturalism, feminist studies, and the like had been matters 
of internal dispute, to be resolved internally, became vulnerable to meddling by outsiders 
with a political agenda. Moreover, the traditional purposes of accreditation--frank, 
collegial criticism and public avowal of academic integrity--were undermined by the 
mistrust generated by this new agenda.</P>
<P>	The threat to our college was plain. If WASC meant what it was saying, it could 
not, in principle, accredit our college. In the eyes of the accreditors, Thomas Aquinas 
College is multiculturally incorrect.</P>
<P>	In a lengthy struggle, Thomas Aquinas College confronted WASC's usurpations. 
We rejected the diversity standards when we came up for reaccreditation in 1992. The 
accrediting team of scholars sent to visit the college came away impressed with our high 
academic standards; in response, WASC reaffirmed our accreditation for eight years. 
When WASC circulated to its members a policy statement purporting to clarify its brief 
and vague standards on diversity, Thomas Aquinas College took the lead in raising 
objections and mobilizing opposition. Other institutions, including the California Institute 
of Technology, the University of Southern California, and Stanford, joined us in 
expressing alarm at the WASC statement. Although WASC formally adopted that 
controversial statement, it now requires colleges only to "thoughtfully engage" the issue 
of diversity.</P>

<H3>The Empire Strikes Back</H3>
<P>	Unfortunately, the story does not end there. Education lobbyists and bureaucrats, 
led by Robert H. Atwell of the American Council on Education, are launching a 
counteroffensive. Atwell co-chairs an ad hoc group called the National Policy Board on 
Higher Education Institutional Accreditation (NPB), which advocates a national 
accreditation organization to police the regional groups and any possible competitors. It is 
being packaged as a way to resist federal regulatory overreach into academia. Don't 
believe it.</P>
<P>	NPB is proposing an organization with unprecedented accrediting clout. It would 
set national standards for all institutional accreditors--in effect, all the agencies that the 
Department of Education uses to determine eligibility for federal money. The 
organization would be both "more specific" in its standards and "more rigorous" in its 
processes. It would establish its own budget, levy dues to be collected by the regional 
accrediting agencies, and wield the authority to impose sanctions against accrediting 
agencies that fail to enforce its standards. This would be the closest thing the nation has 
ever had to a national ministry of education.</P>
<P>	How would Thomas Aquinas, or any college with a distinct mission, fare under 
such a scheme? What would happen to the quality of American higher education?</P>
<P>	The answers are clear from the proposed organization's core standards, which 
include diversity. There is good reason to believe that this new board would promote 
diversity standards nationwide. In fact, the very existence of schools grounded in a 
clearly defined academic philosophy would be at great risk. Atwell has written that 
"diversity among institutions does not satisfy the need for diversity within institutions." 
In other words, colleges and universities whose curricula are specifically dedicated to the 
"great books," a traditional liberal-arts curriculum, a theological focus, or any other 
coherent body of belief would be subject to the multicultural whims of a remote 
bureaucracy.</P>
<P>	Such diversity also could be applied to the internal, everyday workings of all 
institutions that rely upon accreditation: student and faculty composition, trustee 
membership, allocation of resources, and on and on. Atwell has advocated a 
"comprehensive approach that encompasses the makeup of the faculty, student body, and 
staff; the curriculum offered by the institution; and the climate on the campus itself." 
Such a vision invites not diversity, but rather a leveling of the very differences in 
academic emphasis and philosophy that have helped create the finest educational non-
system in the world.</P> 
<P>	Opposition to the new accrediting entity is growing. Among others, American 
University, Boston University, Baylor, Caltech, Holy Cross, John Hopkins, Pepperdine, 
Rice, Stanford, Smith, the University of Dallas, the University of Southern California, the 
University of Missouri, and the University of Vermont all oppose the plan. Congressmen 
William Goodling (R-PA), chairman of the House Economic and Educational 
Opportunities Committee, and Howard McKeon (R-CA), chairman of its higher 
education subcommittee, have written to Education Secretary Richard Riley: "We would 
certainly oppose any attempt to use accreditation--to impose standards unrelated to the 
fiscal interests of American taxpayers which could force schools to change their nature or 
their mission."</P>
<P>	It is not enough, however, to defeat the nationalization plan or fight WASC to a 
stalemate. A genuinely open and collegial system of accreditation, one that allows 
governments to catch fraud and abuse and yet steers clear of political correctness, is 
clearly needed. Like most college presidents, I would prefer to devote my energies to the 
growth and prosperity of my college, to its unique curriculum, and to its ardent, inquiring 
students.</P>
<P>	My experience with accreditation leads me to suggest a policy of decentralization 
and reform to protect the diversity of ideas, programs, and institutions that has served our 
republic so well over centuries.</P>

<H3>An Outline for Reform</H3>
<P>	First, it is essential to restrain the federal government's impulse to govern higher 
education. The federal government may want to promote college and university 
education, for example through subsidies for student loans. But federal aid should permit 
individual students and their families maximum choice, and leave schools free of 
burdensome and possibly ideological regulations.</P>
<P>	Liberal education, with its historical roots in religion and philosophy, deals in 
those ultimate questions that the  American political tradition leaves to associations other 
than the government. That is why, when the G.I. Bill provided federal dollars, the 
gatekeeping function was assigned to non-governmental accrediting agencies.</P> 
<P>	Second, non-governmental accreditation in its present form--regional monopolies 
like WASC--should confine itself to screening out incompetence and fraud. An 
accrediting agency is not, and cannot be, purely private, since it can shut off federal 
money. Recognizing this power, it must show proper restraint. In the short run, such a 
modest role, in which any criticism is non-binding, is less open to abuse than any form of 
regulation, particularly regulation by state governments, which sometimes serve as 
strongholds of the diversity forces.</P>
<P>	The most lasting way to forestall abuse is to break the monopoly. Federal policy 
should therefore favor the formation of high-quality, alternative accreditation agencies, 
perhaps tailored to institutional types: research universities, liberal-arts colleges, or, to 
address the latest outbreak of academic intimidation, pro-life medical schools. Such 
agencies, being genuinely voluntary, can better accommodate their members than one-
size-fits-all monopolies whose standards must measure institutions as diverse as institutes 
of psychology, comprehensive universities, liberal-arts colleges, and research 
universities. Colleges would have an incentive to earn recognition from truly 
independent, private accreditors, since their approval would mean something. The 
resulting competition and emulation would promote quality much more effectively than 
the present system.</P>
<P>	Third, a limited intervention against rogue accreditors who misuse their delegated 
powers can be useful, at least until the monopolies are effectively broken. One instance of 
prudent intervention occurred when Lamar Alexander, then U.S. Secretary of Education, 
restrained the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools when it tried to bully 
Baruch College and Westminster Theological Seminary into accepting diversity 
standards. But it is better to fashion one's own freedom, as we have tried to do within 
WASC, or as would result from the emergence of alternative accreditors.</P>
<P>	Centralization of regional accreditors is exactly the wrong way to go. It was an 
enormous labor for us to alert some of the 145 schools in WASC to the threats posed by 
regional bureaucracy. I seriously doubt that a stronger bureaucratic organization based in 
Washington, D.C., with a membership in the thousands, could ever be moved with a 
similar effort.</P>
<P>	I understand the desire for accountability when federal funds are involved, and I 
understand the natural ambition on the part of the new Congress to reform from the top 
down, but I think it should be resisted. We should remember what happened to the 
national history standards in Goals 2000. First proposed by Lynne Cheney, the head of 
the National Endowment of the Humanities under President Bush, they were hijacked by 
the educators commissioned to execute the project. At the same time, we should move to 
prevent the centralization of the accrediting process.</P>
<P>	The existing national educational bodies that offer to implement reforms tend to 
support fads like the diversity movement, and will try to regiment independent schools. 
Such centralization brought us mandatory training in abortion procedures among 
accredited medical schools.</P>
<P>	We must not set up a shadow national ministry of education under the guise of 
privatization, efficiency, or better standards.</P>
<P>	Its bureaucrats will be no better than government bureaucrats, and even less 
accountable. Above all, colleges and universities will merit the trust of the public and the 
government if they hold true to the timeless standards enunciated by St. Thomas Aquinas 
seven centuries ago: "The study of philosophy is not directed to the various opinions of 
men, but to the truth of things." Truth, not diversity, is the goal of education.</P>

<h3> Making Regulatory Reform A Reality</h3>
<b>By <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a>, Hon. <a href="#mcintosh">David McIntosh</a>, <a href="#smith">Fred Smith</a>, and Dr. <a href="#graham">John Graham</a>.</b>
<p>
A Heritage Foundation Symposium, given January 31, 1996.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>ANGELA ANTONELLI:</b> For supporters of regulatory reform, 1995 was both frustrating and disappointing. What began as promise in the Contract With America became a series of reform bills that called for, among other things, the use of sound science and cost-benefit analysis in regulatory decisionmaking. These bills moved rapidly through the House in early 1995 only to wither and die in the Senate late last year.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the Senate debates, supporters of regulatory reform found themselves losing the public relations battle, unable to keep themselves from being portrayed as extremists with a goal of rolling back decades of environmental, health, and safety protections, and desirous of a renewed effort to pollute America and make it unsafe. Alarmists succeeded in convincing the public that a reformed regulatory system would offer less protection -- for example, women would be denied life-saving mammograms and our food supply would not be safe from deadly <I>e. coli</I> bacteria. And legislators could not respond effectively. What we need to help the American public understand is that regulatory reform means more protection, not less. During 1996, the challenge for think tanks, like Heritage, and the academic and the business community will be to figure out how we can get this message out to the public and reclaim the moral high ground in this debate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American people have not stopped wanting regulatory reform, but we need to help them understand that the goals of reformers are not different -- we want cleaner air and cleaner water -- but we can do it with less money and less government intervention. Today, the federal bureaucracy supports elaborate programs aimed at reducing tiny risks at huge costs to the taxpayer, while more serious dangers go neglected. At the same time, this huge misallocation of resources means these resources are not available for other purposes -- for example, the local community that must spend millions of dollars to eliminate one chemical from its water supply that poses a negligible or non-existent risk to the public cannot spend this money to put police on the streets or build a school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Helping people put daily risks in perspective is one of the challenges we face in making regulatory reform a reality. As Dr. Graham points out, today people are suffering from what can be called a "syndrome of paranoia and neglect" about the potential dangers to their health, safety, and the environment. Risk regulation is responsible for the bulk of the nation's $600 billion in annual regulatory costs, particularly those rules affecting the environment. Dr. Graham's work with Dr. Tammy Tengs recently has shown us that a reallocation of resources to more cost-effective programs could save an additional 60,000 lives per year at no increased cost to taxpayers or industry. 60,000 lives!  And we can also save $31 billion. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 We need to help the public understand that the benefits of regulatory reform can be significant. Reformers need to point out that their reforms and solutions actually save more lives. The challenge now is to get reform back on track to accomplish this. And our distinguished panelists can help us understand how we can do this.

<b>THE HONORABLE DAVID MCINTOSH</b>: Thank you, Angela. I appreciate it, and I appreciate the hard work you have done in this area, both while you were in the Administration and now at Heritage. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I wanted to share with you my perspective on where we've been recently and where we should be going. Speaker Gingrich often uses military analogies to inspire us in the Republican Conference. If I can borrow one of his, I would say that we're somewhere between the Battle of Britain and getting ready to lay the groundwork for Normandy on the question of regulatory reform, which is to say we've come past the crisis stage and have every opportunity in front of us to lay plans for the major siege that will give us the final victory in eliminating unnecessary regulations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I think last year solidified the change in the debate. The Republicans, in the Contract With America, made regulatory reform a key part of their agenda, and the President returned to some of his discussions of the work he had done with Vice President Gore on regulatory reform in their government review. The question is no longer whether we should have regulatory reform, use cost-benefit analysis, or use good science, but how to do that. And that's a major victory for us; we should take stock and be glad about what we have accomplished. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton has done one thing that I think is throwing us off guard, and that is raising the issue of the environment and doing it in a very emotional way. His Clean Water Act statement over the summer is probably the classic: He pointed to something everyone who understood the bill knew would not happen -- that we would start having dirtier streams and waters in this country -- and said, "I'm going to stop that."  This made it appear as if there is more going on than what was really happening. Our job is to communicate with the American people and tell them where we want to take environmental protection in this country and our vision of how to do that. I'll talk more about that later, because I think it's a fundamental issue for us. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Politically, we have a very good coalition. We have the Republican majority, with even many of the moderates agreeing with us on the fundamentals of regulatory reform, and we have the conservative Democrats; the "blue-dog" Democrats are very much on our side on these issues and want to participate actively, to help write the bills and help carry them in the Congress. In the Senate, we're still evolving in that majority. I think we have a numerical majority of 50 plus, but they have different rules, and we do not yet have that supermajority of 60 votes to pass a substantial bill.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I think we must return to the basic principles that have been successful for us. We need to explain regulatory reform in terms of what it does for the average American. Reform will help us create more jobs; it will help us get more products; it will lead to a healthier health system; it will help small businesses be more productive and be able to be competitive. I think we need to search out examples of how the current regulatory system works against us. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I talk with people back home in Indiana about working in a foundry. I put myself through college, and I point out that that foundry is now closed down because they could not afford all costs of compliance of the Clean Air Act Amendments. Two hundred people are out of a job, and their families are affected. It has had a terrible effect on the community. I talk about some of the people I have met in hearings, for example, when we looked at FDA's review process. We heard from a wonderful little 8-year-old girl who is a hydrocephalic child, and she is alive because of a miracle of science. They have a shunt that drains the fluid from the back of her head; it's made out of silicone, and the manufacturers are saying they're no longer going to make that shunt because FDA has still not said that silicone is safe for use in the human body. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These are real regulations having real effects on real people, and we need to continue to paint a picture for the American people about why regulation and regulatory reform are so important. We also need to articulate our principles about using free markets, return to private property rights, use flexible rather than the command-and-control approaches, and explain how our vision of those processes will lead to a better result, including better safety, better health, and a better record on the environment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This leads me to the key area -- the environment -- where I think we need to more effectively articulate our position. Republicans must lay out their vision of environmental protection. We should start by explaining that in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, as we turned towards the goal of protecting the environment in this country, we did what the Soviet Union did. It used a command-and-control approach, made tremendous strides forward, changed from a peasant economy into a manufacturing economy, but at great cost in individual liberty. And what we now see is that if we continue down that route of a command-and-control approach we run the risk of going the way of the Soviet Union, where the structure collapses in on itself. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So if we want to have a truly good record of protecting the environment, we need to follow the same principles we follow in the economic world, where you use free markets, you use property rights as the foundation of your policies. I think we can prove empirically that this will deliver a better result on the environment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Superfund is an example of how a command-and-control approach with significant litigation has failed. I often describe to people an example in Indianapolis of a company called the Heritage Group that has set up a manufacturing process that uses the waste product from Thompson Electronics' etching process. They etch copper and turn it into a computer board that they put in the back of their television sets. The waste product is a fluid highly enriched in copper. The Heritage Group takes that fluid, extracts the copper, and turns it into a food supplement that the pork producers in Indiana use. It's actually better than the existing food supplement for copper.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, EPA and the local EPA officials say they love this. They want to see more of it happening. Nationally, they say, "Well this looks like recycling, and our rule is if it's recycling you have to meet all of the federal requirements."  At that point, it's uneconomical, and the company says, "Sorry, we're not going to set up a plan."  Locally, officials say, "Well, maybe we'll take 10 percent of the waste stream, dilute it, and throw it down the drain, and then we don't have to meet the requirements because it's not really recycling."  Now that's nuts. It's nuts from a financial basis; it's nuts from an environmental basis; and I think we need to explain to people that our system is failing on its own terms to protect the environment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me mention what I think will happen in some areas in Congress this year. We have the Contract bills, which are essentially cost-benefit analysis and risk assessments. We've finished those in the House; we have a very good product, one we can be proud of. We had good support and sponsors from the Senate; Don Nickles worked hard, and Senator Dole took the lead on that bill. But getting to that elusive 60th vote has been nearly impossible, and I suppose it won't happen in this Congress because the opposing forces each time will find some reason to pull back on that 60th vote. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, what do we do?  Do we simply take that issue to the voters in the next election, or do we try to get some parts of our regulatory reform agenda through?  The leaning now in the House and the Senate is to get a consensus bill through and see what we can do. I'd like some of your input on this. The notions that they're talking about are the codification of judicial intervention in the small business protection bill and regulatory review, some form of a sunset bill, and some form of Senator Nickles's bill, which changes the Senate process for reviewing regulations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
All of those are good things. They put on the table cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment, and I think we need to make an evaluation: Do we take these now and put them into law?  The President would likely sign them. The cost is a political one in that we allow our opponents to have a pro-regulatory relief vote. Are we able to do that and nonetheless articulate to the voters next year in the election that this is only part of the agenda, and there are many more fundamental things we need to do?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What about the agency-by-agency and program-by-program regulatory reform bills?  I think you're going to see more pressure for this Congress to deliver on an OSHA reform bill. Labor unions are fighting that very strongly, obviously, but that is the one area where I hear, particularly from small businesses, that they still have an increasing sense of frustration. In addition, I'm getting reports that FDA, in its administrative decisionmaking, has done an about-face, that they've been much more cooperative with medical device and drug manufacturers. I still believe there are fundamental flaws in the system that we have now, and it is because FDA has to have a checkoff at every step of the way in manufacturing in granting the approval of products. We need to keep the pressure up on that, but I think we also need to acknowledge that things are getting better than they were when there was no pressure from Congress. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On Superfund, I think there's a good chance for a bill that will make substantial reforms. I think this must be a key element of our Republican agenda on the environment. There are a couple of other important parts of this agenda. We have debated within the House Republicans on whether we should go forward with reform of the Endangered Species Act. I prefer Rep. John Shadegg's market-oriented approach, and it is one of the most principled approaches that has been supported by work that Heritage has done over the years. I can't tell you that it's going to be the majority view, however; at this point, it's very much up for debate. Also, Corrections Day will give us a pre-procedure to pull out some of these individual items, and I would like to have help identifying areas for Corrections Day, helping move them through the Senate, and publicizing the results. We have a record number of bills that were passed last year. We need to use the process and continue to show action on a case-by-case basis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Finally, I wanted to preview with you where I think we're going to be active in our subcommittee. We've had strategic planning meetings in the last few weeks. I want our subcommittee to be the driving engine for regulatory reform and making the public case for it. The key mechanism we have for that is oversight to show how the agencies fail in their mission and create problems. We will strive to develop a report card on how the Clinton Administration agencies have performed on regulatory reform. I would like to incorporate in that a survey of the outside regulated community. We don't have the resources to do it, so it would have to be conducted by people on the outside. I think we need to be fair -- to acknowledge where progress has been made and commend people. You can get some things by rewarding people for good changes, but I think we also need to be fair in our assessment when we feel the agencies have not gone far enough.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We should adapt the concept Senator Proxmire made very successful for exposing government waste and spending -- the Golden Fleece Award -- for regulatory excesses. We should highlight agency enforcement or regulatory decisions that, when exposed to the light of day, the American public says is nuts. We've been trying to gather those in my subcommittee. Our most recent fax told us how, in New Mexico, a 14-year-old boy was lost with his scout troop when he was hiking and had been in the woods for two or three days. They sent out a search helicopter. The local police found him and radioed a request to land in the forest and pick up the boy and rescue him. Astonishingly enough, the answer came back negative: This is an area where we can't have any mechanized vehicles; you can't land to do this. What they did do is drop a note that said stay there, and we'll send somebody. When the search teams on land couldn't find him and did more environmental damage than the helicopter would have done, they finally sent back the helicopter and pulled the kid out of there. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This is a ridiculous policy, and it's what the American public is fed up with in government regulations and in the administration of these programs. These are the types of policies we need to identify and expose to ridicule. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me just close on a note of optimism. I do think we are at the point of being able to have the fundamental change in the regulatory process that we've been searching for over the years, and I'm very optimistic that public support will be there if we do the right thing in terms of framing the issue in a way that is relevant for the average person. We are also going to need a forceful response to the environmental attack, and I think we can present one that says we can protect the environment better with our principles than the Administration can with its command-and-control approach. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thank you all for letting me come. I really appreciate your work.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <b>FRED SMITH</b>: When David was talking about the military analogies most appropriate to the debate that just took place on the Hill, he mentioned the battle of Britain and the Normandy invasion. Between those two events, as some of you know, there was the abortive incident in which several Canadian divisions were wiped out as we prematurely assaulted a position we were not in place to take. I think we learned from that, also. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A question we need to ask is why a modest bipartisan House bill bogged down in the Senate and then was filibustered to death. At best, the bill required only that government regulators state whether their regulations do more good than harm --sort of a Hippocratic oath for regulators. More important: Why did such a modest reform get such bad press?  Anyone who watches television or monitors the media knows the way this issue was characterized: Mad-dog Republican ideologists join with robber-baron capitalists to regain the right to add poison to baby food bottles. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
That was the bad news. The good news was that we got 58 votes in the U.S. Senate, which suggests two things. One is that the pressures to reform regulations are real and they are growing. We are on the right side of history in this area. The second is that we better become considerably more skillful at marketing and explaining what it is we're about. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I would argue that the environmental debate today is roughly where the welfare policy debate was, say, ten years ago. Then, most felt that the welfare state was cumbersome, costly, bureaucratic, even unsuccessful, yet still necessary. Private alternatives were regarded as largely inadequate to the critical task of helping the nation's poor. If you wanted to help the poor ten years ago, you had to accept and somehow improve the welfare state. The result was reform proposals largely limited to "good government," tinkering at the edges, trying to make the system work a little bit better. The conservative response to the welfare state was to make it more efficient, more effective. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Things have changed. Time and analysis by such scholars as Charles Murray and Marvin Olasky have made more evident the perversities of the welfare state and the value of private charity. Today, the rhetoric of the welfare reform debate focuses on moving beyond, not saving, the welfare state and revitalizing, not ridiculing, the voluntary sector. Our goal should be to accelerate the same shift in the environmental area, to begin to go through the same "re-paradigming" of the situation to make it possible to subject environmental policy to the same scrutinizing debate we're finally achieving in the welfare area. To that end, we must meet three challenges. First, we must move beyond good government reform measures; second, we must develop in much more detail the analytic basis for reform; and third -- and most important -- we must learn how to communicate in a political world. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first challenge, to repeat, is simply to recognize that tinkering is not enough, as you heard to some extent in the remarks of Congressman McIntosh. If federal regulation is not to destroy all our freedoms, we must find some way to discipline our regulatory leviathan. The bills that are pending in the Senate today, S. 343 and so forth, do not achieve that result. None of them really subjects regulation to the same level of scrutiny that we routinely subject spending bills to in the Congress -- and I don't think many of us are happy about the level of discipline we have on spending yet. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
An agency is created -- Interior, Agriculture -- and it goes forth and comes up with creative ideas on how to spend our money better. But that does not become public policy until those spending bills are sent to Congress and the Congress and the President positively affirm those decisions. Spending bills are subject to accountability; Congressmen have to decide whether to vote for or against these spending bills. Regulations are subject to none of that discipline. We create a new regulatory agency, we send it forth to think of good ideas about how to spend our money, and that's it. There is no formal vote by the Congress, and none really by the President himself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The problem is that there's a pro-regulation bias in our system that has never been addressed. It's a loophole in the system. No one, I think, among the Founding Fathers believed federal regulation would ever become the massive leviathan it has become today, and unless we require regulatory accountability, all the procedural reforms in the world are likely to do very little good. We're working on that, Heritage is working on that, and a number of organizations are trying to come up with substantive reform measures. We have a lot more work to do. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second challenge is advancing the analytic basis for reform. I'd like to call your attention to the deregulation battles in transportation in the 1970s. Those victories we did achieve were made possible by earlier analytic work that fell into roughly three areas. First, there were the traditional economic studies of the cost of regulation. Brookings and then AEI and a whole series of groups after that began to examine the cost of regulation, and their conclusion was essentially that government didn't work or was an extremely costly way to achieve sometimes important objectives. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second kind of study was public choice, rent-seeking analysis which, in effect, undermined the moral legitimacy of transportation regulation. A series of studies found that the ICC was too easily captured by special interests. Building on this approach, <a href="http://www.cei.org">CEI</a>, along with Michael Greve of the <a href="/cir">Center for Individual Rights</a>, produced a book called <I>Environmental Politics</I>, which looked at the way rent-seeking explains much of environmental behavior (although anyone who lives in a city with Archer Daniels Midland and Dwayne Andreas, I think, probably understands that pretty well already). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There also were case studies demonstrating the feasibility of a private alternative to the regulated transportation sector. California and Texas, as many of you know, had relatively deregulated air travel systems, and that provided some evidence as to what might happen if we moved to a deregulated environment. Private alternatives, the studies found, had been neglected and actually offered creative alternatives to the regulatory state. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There's been very little work of this sort on environmental issues, although the record of government failure is beginning to emerge. The wonderful book <i>EPA: Asking the Wrong Questions</I> is an example of what can be done, and we're doing a number of smaller studies. Superfund is a poster child of regulatory failure, but there has been far too little work demonstrating just how difficult it is to run an eco-socialist state as opposed to just a socialist state. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The research on rent-seeking as an explanation for much of our environmental policy is important because it affects the moral foundation of the regulatory state. In many ways, it is more important than the cost analysis done by think tanks and economist groups. But most important, and least adequately filled today, is the need for research on private alternatives to environmental regulation. Along these lines, CEI's Center for Private Conservation is developing case studies of how private people outside government -- although sometimes encumbered by government rules -- are playing extremely creative roles in expanding and advancing environmental goals. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The third challenge, and certainly the most important, is to develop a communication strategy which is relevant to the political marketplace. If we are to succeed, we must understand how people form opinions about political issues. I don't think this is well enough understood. As consumers in the private sector, when we buy a car, get married, purchase a house, or take a new job, we have every reason to gain some information about that decision, because the decision we make will directly affect our welfare. We are rationally informed in the private marketplace. We spend our energy to the point where the information we derive no longer makes our decision process more reasonable. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the political marketplace, we use that same calculus, but it leads to a quite different result. I can become informed about the Endangered Species Act; I can become informed about risk reform issues; I can spend a lot of time every night taking the <I>Federal Register</I> to bed with me to read laboriously. But whatever views I come to as an informed citizen have very little to do with what actually happens. The linkage between information and the opinions I form and what actually happens is very, very weak. I am one out of millions of Americans. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
America is not a democracy; it is an interest group democracy. It's important to realize the distinction. Some of you have seen the series in the <I>Washington Post</I> where they're very confused about people's lack of enthusiasm for big government and are trying to sort it out. One of the articles that appeared earlier this week was subtitled "Don't Know, Don't Care."  In it was a quote by Jay McCraken, 34, a technical advisor and part-time college student in Clinton, New Jersey: "It's time-consuming becoming informed. Nobody has the time to sit down and read <I>Time</I> every week to find out what the government's doing."  And this is an informed consumer. People don't have the time to deal with the details of government everyday. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Well, guess what: Jay isn't alone in that. Virtually all Americans form their opinions about policies in ways that are very low on the fact component and very high on the other component, and it's perfectly rational for them to do that. In a world of rational ignorance, we do not need an information-rich campaign; we need another kind of campaign. Facts don't form opinion, yet people certainly have them. What does form opinions?  Aaron Wildavsky and others have argued that values dictate most people's views about most political issues, and therefore we need a value-based communications strategy. Reagan understood that very, very well, and Clinton is a genius at this. Why can't conservatives get it? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What values are we going to use in communicating?  Wildavsky, noting that very few cultures are homogeneous, suggested one useful framework. He had a category that some of you know: fatalist, hierarchalist, egalitarian, individualist. To understand, within this framework, what a values-based communication strategy might look like, let's look again at transportation regulation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Initially, most Americans probably viewed transportation regulation, the creation of the ICC, as a good thing. Regulation appealed to individualists, to free-market types; it would expand choice by keeping the big boys from hogging all the traffic. Regulation appealed to hierarchalist conservatives, the good science types; it would make possible scientific management of our transportation system, eliminating wasteful competition. And, of course, regulation appealed also to egalitarians, progressives, liberals; it would be fairer to the poor and to rural citizens. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Well, experience and time and analysis eroded those beliefs. Deregulation is now possible and popular among liberals as well as conservatives. It's very important to recall that the transportation deregulation fight was led by Ralph Nader and Ted Kennedy, along with a lot of our types. The changes that happened in the transportation area were vital to economic deregulation as well as to the current rethinking of the welfare state. Our challenge is to conduct the research, education, and advocacy work that will make similar change possible in the environmental field. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me briefly analyze how we did not follow this strategy in the recent risk debate in the Senate. We reform types talk largely to ourselves; we made very little effort to reach out to anyone who thought regulation was a good idea. Indeed, the reform message may actually have made it easier for the liberals to mobilize themselves and to become an effective stymier of reform. In contrast, the pro-regulation side targeted clever messages that undermined much of the initial support for regulatory reform. What are the arguments about?  Judicial review?  That will mean more lawsuits, more bureaucracy, as Clinton told us. We don't want big government. They use our language, our rhetoric, our arguments to weaken our support  base for regulatory reform and reform in a number of other areas. They were extremely clever at taking our vocabulary and using value-based arguments to weaken our belief that regulatory reform was a good thing. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The lesson is clear: We must develop and target messages that, while strengthening our troops, also challenge the support base for regulation. We must dramatize the creative strengths of private conservation, private stewardship, private risk management. We must challenge egalitarians by focusing not on cost, but rather on the unfairness and absurdity of the regulatory state, as David has started doing. The rhetoric for that kind of value-based campaign was advanced by the late Aaron Wildavsky. He was the one who told us to talk in terms of risk versus risk as opposed to cost versus benefits, and wealthier is healthier rather than the cost of regulation to business, and to define our goal as a safer, not safe, society. How poor we are because of his loss. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me conclude. My suggestions really come down to three points. We must adopt a strategic reform agenda. We're going to get hammered anyway; we lose little by being bold. Our focus must be on regulatory accountability, not on regulatory assessment. Good ideas are important, and we should put forth the best ideas we have, not some watered down version that can persuade the current thinkers to accept them. We must develop a coherent and coordinated plan to dramatize the failure of the regulatory state to rectify its inherent corruption and to publicize the advocacy and creativity of private-sector alternatives. Finally, we must mount an extensive educational effort, including image-based documentaries, to clarify how regulations harm the poor, minorities, women, and the Third World. Some of you know CEI has recently produced FDA television and radio ads, a Science Under Siege documentary, and a risk communication film. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These are a very small part of what we need to do in this area, and we even have an objective test of whether we'll be successful or not: When Senator Chaffee, Congressman Boehlert, and Greenpeace join Heritage and CEI in calling for the abolition of EPA, we will know we've won. But we have a ways to go. Thank you.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>DR. JOHN GRAHAM</b>: Thank you very much. I don't think there's any more passionate advocate of regulatory reform than myself, but I'm very worried about where we are right now in the debate on regulatory reform. I want to share some of my concerns and really focus my remarks on the next year -- what we have to do to get this issue back on track -- and leave discussion of longer-term ideas, such as some of the ones Fred has on the table, until after 1996. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I will start with my experience last weekend. I spent two days at a National Wildlife Federation conference in New Hampshire, a so-called presidential candidates' forum sponsored by the National Wildlife Federation, where all the candidates were invited to come and discuss their approach to the problem of environmental health and regulatory reform. There were only two Republican candidates who showed up -- Congressman Bob Dornan and Alan Keyes -- and Vice President Al Gore and EPA Administrator Carol Browner came and gave passionate speeches. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I make it a point to go and listen carefully to people who feel very differently from me about issues. From the Vice President, we got the message that these people who say they want regulatory reform don't really want reform; they want relief for polluters and special interests. They say they want a smarter regulatory regime, more science, and more analysis, but want to cut back the budgets of these agencies by anywhere from 10 to 30 percent. What they really want to do is roll back 25 years of progress and protection. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the heart of what the speakers were arguing is that there's a value difference: The President cares about public health and the environment, but people who believe in regulatory reform don't. I think we have to address ourselves to the question of whether they will be successful in the next year in reinforcing this imprint they've tried to put in people's minds, and there is some rhetoric that people are using in the regulatory reform community that I think is very unfortunate and contributes to this problem. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First is "regulatory relief."  I think that's a very unfortunate phrase. I think the public feels that we've had public health and environmental agencies at the federal level for 25 years, and we certainly want to have a very strong case before saying that they don't have a strong role to play. I think our message should be that we want smarter, more efficient regulation in order to get more protection at less cost; therefore, the word "relief" is entirely inappropriate. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, "free-market environmentalism" is an intellectually interesting and exciting concept, but in the next year I think it also will be too risky a concept, because I think it plays too much to the notion in people's minds that some of these reformers actually want to abolish EPA. I don't know whether it's true or not, but both of these speakers I referred to (Gore and Browner) named Congressmen in this town who had said they wanted to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency. Maybe we're going to get to that some day, but I don't think that's a helpful way to talk about these issues. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Third, we heard today about whether we should have the environment above people or people above the environment. I think this plays on the notion that somehow there's a big value difference between where they are and where reformers are: They really care about children's health more than reformers do, or they really care about the environment, about wilderness, about wildlife more than reformers do. I think that's a big mistake; reformers have to stay away from these kinds of generalizations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, what does this mean that we should do?  I think that if we're careful about our steps in the next year, we can make some very substantial progress in advancing the debate on this issue. On H.R. 9, we came through the House debate in very good shape, arguing on principle for sound science, comparative risk, cost versus benefit, and regulatory accountability, not only with Republican votes, but with 60 Democratic votes as well. In the Senate, we stalled, but look at what happened: We ended up with 54 out of 54 Republicans, but the Administration called up the troops and said, "Don't let it happen."  Then Senator Dole made a judgment, which seems to me a reasonable one, that we ought to let Democrats pay the price for that. How big the price is, frankly, depends on how this issue is managed in the next year. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What are the modest steps that we should take?  I think, first, that we need to design a couple of streamlined bills, not big regulatory reform bills, on a couple of key issues and get some more explicit votes on these issues. The first one is the basic concept of comparative risk: Do you believe that government agencies should put their resources on the biggest risks before the little ones and speculative ones?  We ought to make the case that if these agencies were smarter and more scientific, we could reallocate resources, save more lives, and do more for the environment at no increased cost to the taxpayer. As shown by the work of my colleague Tammy Tengs, we can save 60,000 additional lives per year at no increased cost. This basic principle of comparative risk, using our resources better, is one that I think we should force some votes on -- not linked to congressional review of regulations, not linked to costs and benefits, just that specific issue of comparing risks. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second thing I think we ought to do is take President Clinton's executive order as it exists now -- it has some flaws, and I'd like it to be stronger, but it also has some basic principles that are sound -- and have an up-or-down vote on this executive order as a piece of legislation, as a forerunner of a broader and more ambitious program of regulatory reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I think we should ask ourselves, What will Vice President Gore do when confronted with these two prospects?  There are two options: Either vote in favor of these, and have basically a bipartisan consensus behind comparative risk and cost-benefit analysis, or vote no and then recast the debate. I think this is the more likely outcome, and I think it's a good outcome for the people who believe in regulatory reform because it will be clear that reformers share the values of public health and environmental protection but want to use science and economics to achieve them in a more efficient fashion. Reformers have the same values as they do, but can be smarter and more efficient in the way they accomplish these goals. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are some things I think we should avoid and not do over the next year because they undermine our ability to focus a discussion around these two basic principles. First, I do not think we should cut back the budgets of agencies which are the targets of regulatory reform. I think a flat budget is the right way to deal with this in the next year or two, because we're going to be asking these agencies to do more with what they currently have in terms of budgets. In fact, I heard a rumor at this National Wildlife Federation meeting that President Clinton is hoping he can give in on a big cutback in the EPA's budget. Then someone in the campaign can claim, "Look, they want to have more responsibility for EPA, but then they want to cut them. Isn't that an indication that they really want relief, that they don't really want reform?"  I think some people are cynically hoping that these budget cuts will occur so they can claim that reformers caused a lot of blood-letting out there. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, on issues like OSHA reform and Clean Air Act reform, I think the basic message is that if we're smarter or more efficient, we can save more lives and protect the environment better. But the kinds of reforms that radical reformers have in mind require too much discussion in an election year to really get the point across. I don't think they're appropriate at this time. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Third, I think we should make concerted efforts on both the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Superfund law to get good, solid, incremental reform of these laws and, if possible, get them to the President's desk and get them signed. That gives the Republicans a clear record of passing pieces of environmental legislation that embody their principles of sound science, cost-benefit analysis, and risk assessment. By taking this incremental approach over the next year, I think reformers reinforce their commitment to fundamental public health and environmental values. We demonstrate the confidence of our leadership on issues that historically are not Republican issues, and at the same time we build momentum. We build our own morale as a movement to work for larger and more ambitious regulatory reforms at a later time. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In conclusion, I think that we are at a very important point in the movement for regulatory reform. The course we take at this point, and how we represent ourselves as a movement, will be very important in determining how we are portrayed in what we know will be a very vicious election-year campaign on these issues.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

The House-passed versions of several appropriations bills include a number of spending restrictions. While controversial, these limitations, commonly known as riders, in many cases are necessary to encourage federal agencies to act more responsibly in setting and enforcing regulations. They also are needed to encourage the Clinton Administration to work more assiduously with Congress to reform some of the most seriously flawed regulatory statutes.
<p>
As the Senate prepares to consider the Labor/Health and Human Services appropriations bill, and as Congress enters into a conference on other bills, including Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies, and Transportation appropriations, Members should make sure that several riders in the House-passed bills are preserved in the final legislation.
<p>
The most important deal with: <br><ul>
<li><a href="#epa"><b>EPA (VA/HUD bill)</b></a>
<p>
<li> Delaney Clause;
<p>
<li> Wetland enforcement;
<p>
<li> Voluntary environmental self-audits;
<p>
<li><a href="#trans"><b>Transportation</b></a>
<p>
<li> CAFE standards;

<li> Ergonomics and fall protection;
<p>
<li> Striker replacement.

<b>AN IMPERFECT BUT NECESSARY SOLUTION</b>
<p>
Faced with a Congress intent on reducing unnecessary and expensive laws that cannot be justified on public health or environmental grounds, the Clinton Administration has spurned invitations to craft substantive bipartisan reform of existing law. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have persisted in implementing new regulations that are inflexible, expensive, and largely divorced from underlying scientific and economic realities. Congress has few tools to reshape this approach to regulation. 
<p>
The most promising short-term solution is to use the appropriations process to restrict the use of government funds to pursue questionable regulations until a general overhaul of the regulatory process can be achieved. Such riders not only would cool the regulatory zeal of federal agencies, but also would encourage the Administration to show more cooperation in negotiating substantive reform.
<p>

<b>WHAT CONGRESS SHOULD DO</b>
<p>
As the Senate and House-Senate conference committees consider the VA/HUD, Labor/HHS, and Transportation appropriation bills, most of the House riders should be retained, both to prevent federal agencies from promulgating ineffective and expensive regulations and to force the White House to focus on much-needed environmental and labor reforms. While most of the riders in the House-passed bills address important areas, several are particularly important, and including them in the bills sent to President Clinton should be a top priority.
<p>

<a name="epa"></a><b>Environmental Protection Agency (VA/HUD and Independent Agencies bill)<p>

The Delaney Clause</b>
<p>
The House provision would prohibit EPA from revoking or issuing regulations under Section 409 (the Delaney Clause) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act whenever a tolerance has been established under Section 408, which addresses standards for raw foods. The rider also would prevent EPA from simply changing the Section 408 tolerance to comply with Section 409.
<p>
The Delaney Clause was enacted in 1958 to ban any additive in processed food that has been shown -- in any amount -- to cause cancer in humans or laboratory animals. This seemed reasonable in the 1950s because, depending on the chemical, scientists could test only for traces of chemicals in quantities on the order of about one in a million. Today, however, with improvements in technology, scientists can test for many of these chemicals in quantities of about one in a quadrillion (a million billion). Indeed, some can be detected almost down to the molecular level. Thus, extremely small trace quantities that were undetectable -- and thus allowable -- 37 years ago now form the basis for a court order requiring EPA to eliminate the use of dozens of pesticides even though EPA's own findings have shown these same pesticides to be safe up to certain levels. Under Section 408 of the same Act, which relates to raw agricultural commodities, EPA has issued regulations setting the tolerance level deemed safe for consumption. Yet the strict language of the Delaney Clause means that there must be no trace of these same additives in processed foods, despite the finding by EPA that these chemicals can be consumed safely in small quantities. This prohibition is an enormous and needless drain on America's agricultural economy.
<p>
Even EPA Administrator Carol Browner has called for a change in the law. In the early days of the Clinton Administration, recognizing that the law was a scientific anachronism, she said that "right now the law says we cannot have these chemicals concentrated in processed foods. We have to accept what the law is. But at the same time we have gotten to a point where we have to say we know a lot more about these chemicals than we did 35 years ago when the law was passed."1  Unfortunately, the environmental lobby applied severe pressure to the new Administration, and Browner retreated from her initial position. Nevertheless, her early remarks demonstrate the reasonableness of this rider; spending billions of dollars to ban useful, safe pesticides to avoid negligible risks is bad public policy.
<p>
<b>Wetland Enforcement</b>
<p>
As passed by the House, the wetland rider would restrict EPA from enforcing the Section 404 permitting program. The EPA relies on Section 404 of the Clean Water Act to regulate landowners who wish to disturb wetlands on their property. The House rider would restrict EPA's authority to enforce Section 404; the Senate version would limit only its authority to override Army Corps of Engineers permit decisions. While the House rider may be overly broad, and thus may have unintended consequences, the Senate version does not go far enough. In addition to including the Senate provision, the final bill should be strengthened to at least restrict EPA from regulating "non-adjacent" (isolated) wetlands. 
<p>
There are three principal problems with EPA's current wetland policies.2 
<p>
First, the statutory authority itself is questionable. Indeed, authority for "non-adjacent" wetlands seems clearly to be lacking. Obviously, EPA should not pursue policies that neither the Constitution nor federal statute allows it to pursue, and Congress should not permit it to do so. 
<p>
Second, the EPA definition of what constitutes a wetland is too broad. According to the 1987 Delineation Manual, a wetland is any land that meets each of the following criteria:  inundated or saturated to 12 inches deep for at least seven consecutive days and 5 percent of the growing season, and more than 50 percent of dominant plant species are those found in marshes or swamps regardless of whether they are found elsewhere also. The language is so unnecessarily inclusive that land which is bone dry for almost the entire year can be deemed a wetland.
<p>
Third, the financial resources of many Americans are being destroyed in the name of protecting wetlands as landowners are forced to surrender, without compensation, their right to use their property. Because many affected individuals make their living or pay their mortgages from income derived from the land, their savings can be wiped out. For example, Bill Stamp's family in Exeter, Rhode Island, has been blocked from farming or developing its 70 acres of land for eleven years, yet has been assessed taxes at rates determined by the land's industrial value -- up to $72,000 annually. As a result, this fifth-generation farm family may lose its life savings. The government, however, appears unmoved. As one Army Corps of Engineers enforcement officer told Stamp:  "We know that this is rape, pillage, and plunder of your farm, but this is our job."3
<p>
The rider would give American property owners a temporary, partial reprieve from EPA's intrusive regulation while Congress enacts a new, sensible wetlands protection measure. The reform legislation currently in Congress (but under threat of presidential veto) would make wetlands protection legal, priority-based, and fair to those now forced to shoulder the financial burdens alone.
<p>
<b>Voluntary Environmental Self-Audits</b>
<p>
This rider would prohibit EPA from taking legal action against states or companies for environmental violations discovered during voluntary self-audits and disclosed in compliance with state law. 
<P>
Companies that conduct voluntary self-audits to identify and quickly correct any inadvertent violations are required to report their findings to the EPA, which then may fine them millions of dollars for past non-compliance. This policy obviously discourages responsible behavior by companies seeking to rectify environmental problems. If this barrier to voluntary compliance is eliminated, companies will be inclined to clean up pollution more rapidly, more thoroughly, and more cheaply. Numerous companies have indicated they would perform self-audits and correct violations if the threat of prosecution was minimized. Thus, restricting EPA from punishing past inadvertent behavior would benefit both the economy and the environment.
<p>


<a name="trans"></a><b>Department of Transportation (DOT bill)</b>
<p>
<b>CAFE (Fuel Efficiency Standards)</b>
<p>
This rider would prohibit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from further tightening Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards. 
<p>
CAFE rules currently require each automobile manufacturer to sell cars that average 27.5 miles per gallon (mpg) and light trucks that average 20.6 mpg. Enacted in response to the oil crisis in 1973, CAFE was designed to maintain stable, low oil prices by reducing demand. The primary support for continuing the program now comes from the environmental lobby, which sees CAFE as a permanent way to conserve energy. 
<p>
Experience indicates that the program has serious unintended consequences. Tighter standards yield little if any benefit but impose tremendous social and economic costs. The social costs include the additional deaths and serious injuries caused by cars that, while fuel efficient, are less safe because they are of lighter construction. Terminating the CAFE program would save thousands of lives. According to economists Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution and John Graham of the Harvard School of Public Health, 1989 model cars were about 500 pounds lighter than they would have been without the 27.5 mpg economy standard. Crandall and Graham estimate that this weight reduction is responsible for almost one-fifth of passenger fatalities and that the program results in an estimated 2,500 additional deaths and 25,000 additional serious injuries per model fleet year.4  This is a high price to pay for a government program that yields questionable benefits.
<p>
CAFE standards also reduce the affordability of new cars and encourage consumers to keep less fuel efficient cars for a longer time. A 1995 study by Charles Rivers Associates has found that increasing standards by 30 percent would raise the average price of cars by $1,500 and trucks by $2,100. This sticker price increase would lead consumers to keep their older, less fuel efficient autos longer, which in turn would increase pollution by an estimated 4 percent by 2010.5
<p>
Tighter CAFE standards could be devastating to average families. The reason the traditional full-size family station wagon no longer is widely sold is that car manufacturers found it difficult to meet the 27.5 mpg standard for cars with these "gas guzzlers" in their fleets. Consequently, the market for even less fuel efficient minivans exploded because minivans had to meet only the light truck standard of 20.6 mpg.6  But if standards for light trucks are raised, manufacturers will be forced to raise prices dramatically to cut sales of the minivan so that their fleet average is in compliance. Most families no longer could afford the only vehicle designed specifically for families.
<p>

<a name="labor"></a><b>Department of Labor (LABOR/HHS bill)
<p>
Ergonomics and Fall Protection</b>
<p>
These riders prohibit OSHA from developing or issuing any proposed or final ergonomics standard during fiscal 1996, and requires OSHA to revise its fall protection standard to adjust the height threshold for required fall protection equipment (e.g., railings) from 6 feet to 16 feet before it can begin enforcing the rule.
<p>
OSHA's proposed ergonomics and latest fall protection rulemakings are classic examples of how OSHA puts the search for completely risk-free workplaces above common sense. Although Congress intended that OSHA assure workers safe and healthy working conditions, overly burdensome regulations like ergonomics and fall protection present a significant barrier to job creation and increased real wages. OSHA estimates its proposed ergonomics standard will cost $4 billion per year, and the National Association of Homebuilders estimates the fall protection standard will increase the cost of a home by $1,000 to $5,000. The ergonomics standard alone is the equivalent of almost 285,000 entry-level, minimum wage jobs or 115,000 full-time jobs paying $12.14 per hour with complete benefits. Further, OSHA's draft ergonomics standard requires employers to alter work practices continuously to keep up with developments in ergonomics. It is difficult to imagine how employers can ensure compliance with a regulatory moving target without incurring substantial additional costs. 
<p>
OSHA should be looking at less costly alternatives, but it is not. A broad-based standard like OSHA's draft regulation would impose large and unnecessary costs on small business without necessarily reducing ergonomic injury and illness. OSHA's mandate to formulate an ergonomics standard is based on a subjective and unclear definition. The evidence of causation is unclear, and risk factor threshold levels are unsubstantiated. There has been too little scientific research on ergonomic disorders for anyone to know whether such research can provide adequate guidance for the development of a broad standard. 
<p>
<b>Striker Replacement</b>
<p>
This rider prohibits any executive order or rule that penalizes a contractor because it permanently replaced lawfully striking workers during fiscal 1996.
<p>
Executive Order 12954, issued March 8, 1995, requires that any federal contractor who hires permanent striker replacement workers be subject to termination of the contract or debarment. The $100,000 annual threshold effectively extends coverage to contractors receiving 90 percent of federal contracts and will raise the cost of federal contracts as employers are forced to take into account the potential cost of settling labor disputes. The Employment Policy Foundation estimates the annual economic cost of implementing the order at between $520 million and $2 billion.7  Further, the order will increase the likelihood of strike activity, hurting both union workers and employers through lost wages and output, and may discourage unionized employers from even bidding on federal contracts. It also will increase the incentive for businesses to set up nonunion subsidiaries and encourage the use of nonunion subcontractors, two moves that ultimately hurt union workers' income and job opportunities. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
While permanent labor and environmental policy reform should be pursued, many of the problems addressed by the House appropriations riders are so egregious that immediate relief should be granted. While these riders are an imperfect solution, Americans should view them as necessary to encourage recalcitrant federal agencies to work with Congress to reform some of the nation's most burdensome regulatory statutes.

<center><h3><i> USING THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS TO CURB EPA'S REGULATORY EXCESSES</i></h3>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The House-passed version of the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies appropriations bill includes 17 restrictions on the Environmental Protection Agency's use of appropriations to implement select environmental laws. These limitations, more commonly known as appropriations "riders," have proven to be controversial. But in many cases they are needed to encourage the EPA and the Clinton Administration to act more responsibly in setting and enforcing regulations. They also are needed to encourage the Agency and the White House to work with Congress to reform some of the most seriously flawed environmental statutes. 
<p>
The bill reported out of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, includes only one rider, which prohibits the EPA from requiring states, under Section 304 of the Clean Air Act, to enforce trip reduction efforts such as car pooling. As the Senate acts on the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies bill, however, there are important reasons why it should adopt most of the EPA riders in the House version. While they would limit the promulgation and enforcement of regulations under laws dealing specifically with air, water, waste, pesticides, and similar problems, most deal with the general application of law1 and represent an attempt to correct examples of excess or abuse by the EPA. <p>Both the EPA and the White House brought about this action by refusing to cooperate in substantive reform of existing law. Faced with a Congress intent on reducing unnecessary and expensive laws without sacrificing environmental quality, the Administration has persisted in spurning efforts to craft bipartisan reform. Indeed, the EPA has been assiduous in implementing new regulations that are inflexible, expensive, and pay little attention to the underlying science or economics. Congress has but few tools to reshape policy in this situation. The most promising short-term solution is to use the appropriations process to restrict the use of government funds to pursue certain goals. Environmental riders not only would cool the EPA's regulatory zeal, but also would encourage the Administration to show more cooperation in negotiating substantive reform.
<p>

AN IMPERFECT BUT NECESSARY SOLUTION
<p>
Appropriations riders are not a substitute for substantive reform. They can be useful as stop-gap measures, but changes are needed in the underlying statutes.
<p>
Nevertheless, using the appropriations process in most cases is still better than taking no action. The Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) is a good example of why environmental riders can be an imperfect solution. As part of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act of 1986, TRI requires companies to report to the EPA any legal releases of chemicals officially listed as toxic, so that communities will know the types and quantities of these chemicals that end up as wastes. The requirement applies when waste is released into the air or water, and when it is disposed of properly at a landfill or incinerator -- even if that facility is federally run.
<p>
While no doubt well intentioned, TRI has not been a success. Industry experts estimate that it imposes nearly $1 billion in costs, and the list includes numerous chemicals that pose little risk. Particularly troublesome is the EPA's proposal to require that companies report their use of individual chemicals, regardless of whether these chemicals are released into the community or recycled during manufacturing. It is clearly inconsistent with the original intent of the law, which deals with releases into the environment, to require companies at enormous expense to catalog every instance of a chemical's use in its manufacturing. Indeed, the General Accounting Office concluded recently that the EPA's regulatory plan is too ambitious and too great a burden on the chemical industry.2
<p>
In order to make these and other critical environmental issues a priority for this Administration, Congress has been forced to use appropriations riders to force officials to address programs that do not work. In this context, using the appropriations process to restrict enforcement to the reporting of chemicals listed in the authorizing legislation is entirely reasonable. 
<p>
Unfortunately, the TRI rider is less attractive politically than other riders. President Clinton has chosen to politicize and obscure this issue and ignore the underlying problems. Rather than acknowledge the merit in Congress's effort to draw attention to a serious example of over regulation, the Administration falsely claims that the bill would allow firms to pollute communities with toxic chemicals. Unfortunately, proponents of the rider are hampered by the difficulty of communicating this complicated issue to the public. This difficulty underscores the limits of such riders, which must be categorical in their limitations and thus may be nearly as inflexible in the short term as the regulatory excesses they correct. This is why general reform legislation would be far better. Nevertheless, most of these riders are necessary short-term solutions to intractable regulatory problems.
<p>

WHAT THE SENATE MUST DO
<p>
As the Senate considers the EPA appropriations, it should keep most of the House appropriations riders to force the EPA and the White House to focus on much-needed environmental reforms. Congress also should make a concerted effort to identify these as important and communicate this effectively to the public. While many of the riders in the VA/HUD/Independent Agencies appropriations bill address important areas, several are particularly important, and including them in the Senate bill should be a top priority. Three of the most important riders not included in the Senate bill deal with: 
<p><ul>
<li> Wetland enforcement;
<li> Enforcement against states litigating Title V of the Clean Air Act (CAA); and
<li> Penalties against companies for acting responsibly.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Wetland enforcement.</b>
The wetland rider would restrict the EPA from enforcing its Section 404 permitting program. The EPA relies on Section 404 of the Clean Water Act to regulate landowners who wish to disturb a wetland on their property. There are three principal problems with EPA's wetland policies.3 
<p>
First, the statutory authority is questionable; indeed, for isolated wetlands, known as "non-adjacent" wetlands, authority seems clearly to be lacking. Obviously, EPA should not pursue policies that neither the Constitution nor a statute allows it to pursue. 
<p>
Second, the EPA definition of what constitutes a wetland is so unnecessarily broad that land which is bone dry for almost the entire year can be deemed a wetland. 
<p>
Third, the financial resources of many Americans are being destroyed in the name of protecting wetlands because they are forced to surrender, without compensation, their right to use their land. Because many of these affected individuals make their living or pay their mortgages from income derived from the land, their savings can be wiped out. 
<p>
The principal reason for this rider is to give Congress time to enact legislation. This legislation would make wetlands protection legal, priority-based, and fair to those now forced to shoulder the financial burdens alone.

<p>
<b>Enforcement against states litigating Title V of the Clean Air Act.</b>
This rider would restrict EPA from promulgating, implementing, or enforcing the federal permitting program under Sections 502(d)(2), 502(d)(3), and 502(i)(4) of the CAA against a state involved in Title V litigation with the Agency. This provision provides a strong tool against EPA regulatory zeal in the face of state government resistance. Currently, EPA has the authority and incentive to write further regulations under Section 502 and impose sanctions against states that, instead of completing their State Implementation Plans, are litigating Title V. Clearly, states that believe the EPA has overstepped its bounds and is pursuing inflexible and unnecessary regulations detrimental to their residents should have access to the courts without the harassment of sanctions.
<p>

<b>Penalizing companies for acting responsibly.</b>
This rider would prohibit EPA from taking legal action against states or companies for environmental violations discovered during voluntary self-audits and disclosed in compliance with state law. Companies that inadvertently violate environmental regulations now are discouraged from conducting voluntary self-audits to correct violations quickly because they must report their findings to the EPA, which may fine them millions of dollars for past non-compliance. This policy discourages responsible behavior. But if barriers to voluntary compliance are eliminated, companies will clean up pollution faster, more thoroughly, and more cheaply. Because numerous companies have indicated they would perform self-audits and correct violations if the threat of prosecution were minimized, restricting EPA from punishing this past behavior would be a win-win situation for the economy and the environment.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
While permanent environmental policy reform should be pursued, many of the problems addressed by the House appropriations riders are so egregious that immediate relief should be granted. While these riders are an imperfect solution, the Senate must view them as appropriate and necessary to encourage a recalcitrant EPA and White House to reform some of the most burdensome environmental statutes.
<p>
In addition to the one rider in the bill reported out of the Senate subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, the Senate would do well to include, at a minimum, the three riders in the House version relating to wetlands, Title V of the Clean Air Act, and voluntary environmental self-audits. Failing that, Congress should fix these problems when the House and Senate bills reach the Conference Committee.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	Facing a crowded legislative calendar, the Senate this week is rushing to complete work on landmark legislation that will reframe the process and analytical criteria that federal agencies must follow to issue regulations. For example, the bill includes a requirement that agencies should consider the costs and benefits of their regulatory actions. Remarkably, this common sense way of making a decision, used by people to make decisions in their personal lives, has been deemed too radical for the federal government to use regularly in making decisions about how to protect public health, safety, and the environment. 
<p>
	 Federal regulatory agencies are out of control, and Congress must impose discipline on the regulatory process. Today, agencies are interpreting regulatory statutes in ways that Congress never intended. If Congress understood in advance how much some of these regulations would cost to implement, many lawmakers would never have voted for them. Presidents also have tried but failed to rein in agencies. Every President since Richard Nixon has required this kind of cost-benefit analysis by executive order,1 but agencies have paid only lip service to the orders. Unlike the Reagan and Bush Administrations, the Clinton Administration has further weakened this effort because it actually uses Executive Order 12866 to appear to support sensible, rational rulemaking while doing little in reality to accomplish that objective. Indeed, the Clinton Administration seems to believe that federal regulatory agencies have done a fine job and should be left alone to continue to exercise discretion that thwarts the will of Congress and costs the American economy billions of dollars.
<p>
	Congress must give federal regulatory agencies a rulemaking road map that includes well defined, analytical standards that all rules must meet. Abuse of agency discretion is the heart of the problem that Congress is being asked to solve. Leaving the door wide open for agencies to continue business as usual is not acceptable.
<p>
	Unfortunately, the leading Senate bill, a compromise drawn up by Senators Robert Dole (R-KS) and J. Bennett Johnston (D-LA), is seriously -- and perhaps even fatally -- flawed. The goal of the bill should be to achieve real reform. But, as Senator Johnston recently explained, "this is a huge and vitally important bill where each word carries tremendous meaning.... "2 Senator Johnston understands this well because he has worked tirelessly on behalf of the Clinton Administration to introduce technical language to weaken the key provisions of Senator Dole's original bill,      S. 343, The Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, through important word changes.
<p>
	The problem now is that these seemingly arcane choices of language so severely change the legislative effect of the bill that its intent will not be achieved. Indeed, such a law might actually give individual regulatory agencies greater statutory protection from citizen and even Executive Branch efforts to end ineffective or burdensome regulation. The bill contains some useful reforms. But thanks to the careful    inclusion of certain language by those who generally do not support regulatory relief, the bill as it now stands could turn out to be a setback for regulatory reform. 

<p>
<b> THE DOS AND DON'TS OF EFFECTIVE REGULATORY REFORM</b>
<p>
	The current process for making regulatory decisions does not work. It allows agencies routinely to promulgate expensive rules, where the cost to individuals and businesses far outweighs the benefits. The time is ripe for legislation to make sure that regulatory policies in the future are based on sound data and analysis of the costs, benefits, and risks of regulation and create regulatory decisionmaking processes that are more open and accountable to the American people.
<p>
	To achieve this objective, legislation would need to incorporate certain key elements. But it would also need to avoid certain other seeming "reforms" which would actually make the regulations more burdensome and bureaucratic. In order for legislation to achieve reform, it must include strong provisions that:
<p><ul>
<li>Require agencies to use sound data and analysis on the costs, benefits, and risks of regulation and then apply effective criteria to this information to make sound regulatory decisions; 

<li>Enhance public involvement by empowering citizens to petition agencies to review rules to see whether they meet these tests; and 

<li>Hold agencies accountable for their actions by subjecting their actions to judicial review.
</ul><p>
	Specifically, regulatory reform would be characterized by the following "Dos" and "Don'ts" (section references are to the bill as published in the June 21, 1995, Congressional Record).

<p>
<b>1) DECISIONAL CRITERIA</b> (Section 624)
<p>
	DO require that benefits "outweigh" or "exceed" the costs. This key element of reform would force agencies to place the appropriate emphasis on developing unbiased or expected value estimates of both the costs and benefits. Neither costs nor benefits can be known with certainty, particularly in a regulatory context where agencies are, in effect, forecasting or predicting future events involving risk. However, agencies should have to place a value on these costs and benefits that can then be reviewed.
<p>
	DON'T allow agencies simply to contend that benefits "justify" the costs. The use of the word "justify" by agencies today to finesse the process of weighing the costs and benefits is largely subjective. Agencies simply declare that according to their own value criteria the benefits are greater than the costs. But the whole purpose of establishing a cost-benefit standard should be to create a more <i>objectively</i> based, fairly balanced evaluation of all the competing interests involved. Legislation must do this.
<p>
	DO require that agencies choose the regulatory alternative that will "maximize net benefits."  This is perhaps the most critical element of the regulatory reform discussion. A "net benefit" standard is far superior to a "least cost" standard. Even the Clinton Administration, in Executive Order 12866, includes among its principles that an agency "maximizes net benefits... unless a statute requires another regulatory approach."3  Only if the statute does not allow a rule to satisfy the "net benefit" standard should the agency be permitted to select the "least cost" alternative.
<p>
	When an agency is allowed or required to choose the least cost alternative, it may do so without ever stopping to consider whether the regulatory action is worth taking or maximizes benefits. 
<p>

	The table above (not available) illustrates what could be an undesirable regulatory outcome from applying the "least cost" standard. Alternative One is the lowest cost option, but actually costs more per life saved than Alternative Two. However, the agency must choose Alternative One over Alternative Two at a cost of an additional 80 lives per year. In this case, the agency should be allowed to select Alternative Two, the more expensive rule which has the greater "net benefits."  The "least cost" standard precludes this. In addition, if an agency has no idea of what the benefits are or is disinclined to calculate them, it can still promulgate a rule because the least cost standard merely requires it to pick the cheapest rule. There is no need to ask whether there are any benefits from taking the action at all. But a maximizing net benefits approach forces the agency to examine the cost-benefit rationale for its proposed rule.
<p>
	DON'T allow agencies to get away with issuing rules based on mere assertions of benefits. Agencies often cite tremendous uncertainty about the benefits of the regulations they propose. Unfortunately, a least cost standard allows agencies to get away with this. Consequently, agencies just assert that there are difficult-to-qualify benefits and they "justify" the costs of an action. Agencies must be required to use the best data available in performing an analysis of a rule's benefits and costs. 
<p>
 	DON'T let the agency loopholes be bigger than the loop. Lawmakers should not be fooled into believing there are cost-benefit decisional criteria in a statute if the legislation also gives agencies ample exemptions from using them. Agencies already argue that there are uncertainties or benefits that are nonquantifiable. A least cost approach gives them the incentive to continue doing so. Thus, regulators generally are comfortable with a least cost approach because it allows them to escape any requirement rather than attempt to determine seriously what the benefits of their action would be and compare them with the cost.
<p>


<b>WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO</b>
<p>
	Section 624 of the bill unfortunately establishes extremely weak criteria that agencies must use in making regulatory decisions. The provisions are so full of exceptions that an agency could justify almost anything it wanted to. The bill requires an agency merely to show that a rule's benefits "justify" costs. In addition, the rule the agency adopts must be the "least cost" alternative of the reasonable alternatives considered, and even what alternatives are considered appears subject to agency discretion.
<p>
	Even these two troublesome criteria are further weakened because the bill allows agencies to adopt more costly rules when there are "scientific, technical, or economic uncertainties or nonquantifiable benefits to health, safety or the environment...."  This plays completely into the hands of regulators, since agencies and the Clinton Administration routinely claim that benefits are often nonquantifiable. So this provision would allow agencies essentially to be able to justify whatever alternative they want, even if it is very costly and even if there are no benefits.
<p>
	If a statute precludes an agency (or the agency interprets the statute to preclude it) from weighing costs and benefits, then in reality it need only meet the other criteria established. The fact that an agency must "clearly articulate" its evaluation of the relationship of costs to benefits will have little value if a particular law or the agency's interpretation of that law does not require such a relationship even to be established.
<p>
<b>2) COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS</b> (Section 621)
<p>
	DO require agencies to look at "incremental" costs and "incremental" benefits. "Incremental" is another key term in regulation. There may be diminishing returns in taking a regulatory action. Analyzing the "incremental" effect would require agencies to apply cost-benefit analysis to assess the utility of each further increment of control or action. For example, EPA should not be able to develop a new clean air rule and simply state that the rule achieves the desired benefit. There are lots of things that help make the air cleaner. What EPA should be forced to show is that the additional improvements in clean air are directly attributable to the rule with the additional cost. That makes it more difficult for an agency to choose actions that have very high incremental costs but little added benefit.
<p>
	DO require agencies to analyze clearly for the public record what they consider to be the nonquantifiable costs and benefits. The American people have a right to know what value judgments federal bureaucrats have made on their behalf. In particular, agencies must be able to show some reasoning behind their selection of nonquantifiable costs and benefits.
<p>
	DON'T let agencies off the hook from explaining to the public the relationship between benefits and costs, both quantifiable and nonquantifiable. This is particularly important if, as the Clinton Administration has argued, cost-benefit analysis is a necessary mix of scientific and value judgments. In the period for reviewing and commenting on proposed regulations, the American people have a right to know what the relationships are between the quantifiable and <i>non-quantifiable</i> costs and benefits and the importance the agency has given to each of them.
<p>
	DO require agencies to include the analysis of a range of alternatives that can educate Congress and the public about regulation and its consequences. Such a provision in reform legislation becomes even more important if the law unwisely requires a least cost standard, because the consequences of the rule must be fully understood. Agencies should be required to include a discussion of the costs and benefits of a range of regulatory alternatives, even if the underlying statute may preclude the adoption of one or more of the alternatives. Some of the overzealous and expensive regulatory actions taken by agencies are done because Congress has prescribed it in law -- with lawmakers often unaware of the alternatives at the time. Unless Congress takes the position that it always has the best information available when it makes these kinds of decisions, agencies should be required to provide information to Congress and the public about regulatory alternatives that may be preferable to what is prescribed in law. That would allow Congress the option of modifying the law.
<p>
	DO require agencies to assess the cumulative burden of a rule and the burden on small business. Agencies must be required to assess the cumulative burden of their regulatory actions and the burden on small businesses. The Clinton Administration wisely considered these important enough to include this item in the regulatory principles of E.O. 12866.4 Unfortunately, agencies routinely ignore the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which requires agencies to assess specifically the impact of their regulations on small business. As the Clinton Administration puts it, regulatory agencies "still tend to draft one-size-fits-all" regulations.5 Small businesses are extremely vulnerable to heavy regulatory compliance costs. Congress thus must require agencies to be flexible in crafting rules to minimize the burden on smaller firms.
<p>


<b>WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO </b>
<p>
	Unfortunately, rather than require agencies to focus on the incremental costs or benefits, the definitions in the bill appear to allow an agency to attribute almost any benefits to a rule that may not, in reality, be the result of that rule but of some other "agency action."  True, an agency is allowed to do the same for "cost," but regulators have no incentive to do so. What this means is that agencies have wide freedom to find unrelated benefits to justify the costs of a rule.
<p>
	Section 622 of this bill does require agencies to include cost-benefit analysis as part the proposed and final rulemaking processes. It restricts an agency's discussion of reasonable alternatives solely to those the agency has the authority to consider. In addition, the bill appears to limit further the benefits of examining reasonable alternatives by allowing an agency to choose which alternatives it will consider rather than all of them (as specified in the bill). There appears to be no requirement that an agency must include in its cost-benefit analysis either an assessment of the cumulative impact or the impact on small business.
<p>
	Agencies are allowed, under the bill, to issue a major rule for effect without the cost-benefit analysis if the agency "for good cause finds that conducting the cost-benefit analysis is impracticable due to an emergency or health or safety threat that is likely to result in significant harm to the public or natural resources."  This is an extremely broad exemption, which may even be broader than what is currently permissible under the Administrative Procedures Act. How broadly can agencies interpret "health or safety threat"?  Can a regulatory action designed to save one hypothetical life be justified here?  This exemption should be exercised only rarely, or it would become a huge loophole. This weak provision can be strengthened by requiring the agency head to make the "good cause" determination only in emergencies and to justify it directly to Congress.
<p>
<b>3) RISK ASSESSMENT</b>
<p>
	DO require agencies to generate and disclose central tendency estimates of risk. Some agencies focus entirely on "worst-case," "upper-bound," or "high-end" estimates of risk. These estimates are not necessarily wrong or always inappropriate for decisionmaking. However, they are always wrong, inappropriate, and misleading when they are provided as estimates of "the" risk. Further, such estimates cannot be properly used in cost-benefit analysis -- except where an agency seeks to show that, under even the most favorable circumstances, the benefits of a proposed regulation do not justify the costs. Where they are proposing to regulate, agencies should be prohibited from providing estimates only of the "worst-case," the "upper-bound," or the "high-end."
<p>
	DO encourage agencies to generate as much of the full risk distribution as possible. Risks are never uniform across the population, and all risk estimates suffer from considerable uncertainty. Most risk experts agree that it is better to ascertain the entire risk distribution rather than to rely on single-valued point estimates. While it is not possible to do this perfectly, every effort ought to be devoted to doing it as well as possible. Legislation should provide incentives that encourage both regulatory agencies and regulated entities to estimate more the risk distribution than just the central tendency.
<p>
	DO require agencies to disclose fully the assumptions, data, models, and inferences that underlie their risk assessments. The public cannot be expected to comment intelligently upon (or successfully challenge) agency risk assessments that are cryptic or inadequately documented. Risk experts agree that transparency is key to effective review and oversight. Only those who fear being held accountable oppose consistent, firm, and unyielding demands for full disclosure.
<p>
	DON'T allow agencies to get out of performing risk assessments for major rules by asserting vague claims of impending health, safety, or environmental catastrophe. Such claims are implausible on their face without a credible risk assessment, for how would an agency head know that a catastrophe lurks without scientific evidence?  It is important to permit agencies to respond to real emergencies without first performing a sound risk assessment because time is of the essence. However, once this response is in place, there is no legitimate reason for waiving normal analytic requirements. Emergency action promulgated without risk assessment (or cost-benefit analysis) should automatically sunset when agencies fail to fulfill their analytic and procedural requirements in a timely fashion.
<p>


<b>WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO </b>
<p>
	The discussion draft incorporates many important principles for risk assessment and risk characterization, and risk assessments performed in accordance with its spirit will be better than current practice. Unfortunately, the draft falters in too many places where reasonable performance standards could easily be articulated and may provide loopholes that are too numerous and too large.
<p>
	Section 633(f)(1) directs agency heads to express risk estimates in terms of ranges or distributions, but fails to express a preference for the latter. Ranges are not nearly as useful as distributions, and in many instances they will be highly misleading.
<p>
	Section 632(c)(1)(A) allows agencies to evade the risk assessment requirements entirely by asserting vague "health or safety threat[s]... likely to result in significant harm."  Regulations imposing billions of dollars in cost and preventing a mere handful of hypothetical cancer cases have nevertheless been issued on the ground that such risks are "significant."  With this history, it is hard to be optimistic about agencies' willingness to foreswear this huge loophole.
<p>
<b>4) JUDICIAL REVIEW</b> (Sections 553, 706)
<p>
	DO include a strong judicial review provision that makes agencies accountable to the public. The only way agencies will perform the analyses required by a strong standard for cost-benefit and decisional criteria is if the courts can check them. The courts must be allowed to consider whether or not the agency followed the legal procedures for public notice and comment and the extent to which the analyses required by the regulatory reform legislation relate to the agencies' decisional responsibilities as specified in the law.
<p>
	A strong judicial review provision is needed to force agencies to comply more strictly with a reform statute. But such a provision means little if the cost-benefit standard and decisional criteria are weak, for an agency can happily comply with legislation with a weak standard. 
<p>
	 The Administration and Senate Democrats, who generally have supported the aggressive use of regulation, understandably do not want strong judicial review. But they also know that they can weaken the effect of judicial review by watering down the cost-benefit standard and the decisional criteria. In doing so, the courts will have a hard time finding fault with an agency's chosen action.
<p>


<b>WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO </b>
<p>
	The standards for review in Section 625 allow courts to set aside an action which is "arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion (or unsupported by substantial evidence where the standard is otherwise provided by law)."  The problem is that, given the weak nature of other provisions of the bill, there will be very few cases where the courts will be able to set aside an agency rule on these grounds. Indeed, the bill seems to enhance -- rather than control -- an agency's ability to exercise its discretion, and the public will have difficulty challenging it in court.
<p>
<b>5) ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES</b> (Section 553)
<p>
	DON'T let agencies off the hook easily for providing public notice and disclosure and following public procedures. Exemptions from such requirements should be the exception, not the norm. Today, agencies continue to stretch compliance with requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act. Agencies must recognize that the public has a right to this information and the fact that it is perhaps inconvenient or takes time to provide it is not an acceptable excuse from doing it. Demonstrating that the public notice and procedures are "contrary to the public interest" appears to be a sufficient standard.  If an agency feels that is compelled to circumvent public notice and comment and/or cost-benefit analysis, this choice must be made at the highest levels of the agency and only for true "good cause."  In addition, if an agency uses the exemption, it should be required to go back later and follow the appropriate public procedures. Even the Paperwork Reduction Act requires agencies that have sought emergency exemptions from OMB review to go back and submit a proper request for approval and make any changes required based on public comment and OMB review. Regulations should be held to at least the same, if not a higher, standard than paperwork.
<p>
	DON'T allow agencies to issue conflicting or duplicative rules. Agencies should be expected before issuing a final rule, to the extent permitted by law, to make sure it is not incompatible with or duplicative of any other rules already in force. Agencies are notoriously bad at coordinating their regulatory actions. OIRA has played a critical role in doing this for them. However, it is not without a tremendous amount of effort. Again, even the Clinton Administration in E.O. 12866 includes among its regulatory principles instructions to agencies "to avoid regulations that are inconsistent, incompatible or duplicative with other regulations or those of other federal agencies."6  At a minimum, an agency should explain in its proposed and final rules what steps it has taken to work with other agencies to resolve conflicting policies or duplicative efforts.
<p>


<b>WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO</b>
<P>
	Section 553 addresses the administrative procedures agencies must use to promulgate rules. It outlines what agencies must include in their proposed and final rules, and the ways in which agencies may go about gathering information about a proposed action. These changes are important because agencies are required to disclose to the public important information, including information regarding any cost-benefit analysis, and alternative methods of compliance. However, there is a "good cause" exemption, and it does not appear to require an agency that has an exemption to go back later, follow public procedures, and make any necessary changes. 
<p>
	 Section 553 also gives interested persons the right to petition for the "issuance, amendment or repeal of a rule."  The petition process for major rules is further addressed in Section 623(j).
<p>
<b>6) PETITIONS</b> (Section 623)
<p>
	DO require a strong public petition process and keep it separate from the agency's "look-back" timetable. The public should be given the right to demand that an agency reexamine any aspect of a "major" rule after it has gone into effect, including the underlying cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment. Today, the public can comment on a rule only before it is promulgated. Affected individuals and industry should have the ability to petition agencies and/or the President to reexamine regulations, to the extent permitted by law. This should include petitions targeted at specific types of regulations, to repeal agency guidance enforced as regulation, to examine alternative methods of compliance or waive compliance with rules, or to reexamine the risk assessment or cost-benefit analyses performed. However finely the petition process is structured, it should include:  1) an advisory committee of experts in the agency's area of responsibilities to help review and advise the agency; 2) clear deadlines for when an agency must respond to petitions; and 3) a prohibition on the consideration of additional similar petitions for a reasonable period once a decision is made.
<p>
	Until an agency makes a decision regarding an existing rule in response to petitions submitted, the agency should not limit the number of petitions submitted. The petition process should be seen as operating for existing rules in a manner similar to the way in which the public comment process works for proposed future rules. An agency may receive hundreds or thousands of public comments on a regulation during the proposed rule stage. Today, an agency cannot limit the number of comments it receives on a proposed rule because there might be too many. That is the whole point of the public comment process; people have a right to participate in regulatory decisions that affect them. Similarly, an agency should not limit the number of petitions submitted for fear of getting too many. The fact that there might be 1,000 identical petitions filed should be a message to the agency that there is a serious problem that deserves its attention and soon. There is a frightening arrogance in taking the position that the government does not have to be responsive to the needs of the people because it will make too much work for government bureaucrats.
<p>
	The right to force a reexamination by petition should not depend on the agency's timetable for reviewing its own rules (the "look-back" process). Linking the petition and look-back process would give agencies ample opportunity to avoid or delay addressing petitions or reviewing rules in a timely manner. 


<p>
<b> WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO</b>
<p>
	While Section 553 gives the public the right to petition for "the issuance, amendment or repeal of a rule," Section 623 appears to undermine seriously the effectiveness of this petition process. Under this Section, one of the reasons a petition to amend or repeal a major rule would be rejected is if the rule has already been included as part of the agency's final review of rules schedule.
<p>
		So if an agency has already decided that a major rule will not be reviewed for, say, another ten years, the petition will not be granted. The only recourse the affected party has is then to petition to change the priority the agency has assigned to the review of the rule. But that agency petition review process alone could take anywhere from 18 to 36 months without anything being done to change the schedule for reviewing the rule, let alone changing the rule itself. The same procedures would apply to petitions to review interpretive rules, general statement of policy, and guidance. These provisions thus appear to allow agency bureaucracy to thwart providing any kind of timely regulatory relief for the most expensive, burdensome rules.
<p>
<b>7) AGENCY REVIEW OF RULES</b> (Section 623)
<p>
	DO require agencies periodically to review existing regulations and do it frequently.  In E.O. 12866, the Clinton Administration included a "look-back" mechanism.7 To date, the success of this effort has been limited. Agencies should be required by statute to work in conjunction with OIRA to establish schedules for the review of major rules. Some proposals have suggested that agencies should wait ten or more years to review rules. This makes no sense. These federal regulatory agencies have tens of thousands of employees who handle these program rules every day:  they, as well as the public, know what rules do not work. The Vice President's "reinventing regulation" reports have begun to ask them. The American people should not have to wait more than ten years to change or eliminate rules that the federal government itself has already decided are unwise. Thus, while regulatory reform legislation should improve standards for future rulemakings, it also should provide a more timely mechanism for reassessing existing regulations. 

<p>
<b> WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO</b>
<p>
	Section 623 gives federal agencies, rather than the affected public, the ability to determine when burdensome regulations will be reviewed and perhaps changed. This provision appears to allow agencies to take as long as 14 years to revise a regulation. Thus, under the bill, agencies possibly could be allowed to take until 2010 even to consider changing rules that the Clinton Administration already may have identified as ineffective or excessive through its "reinventing government" efforts. 
<p>
	 Specifically, agencies are required by the bill to solicit comment on a preliminary schedule of review of rules they have identified within one year (and every subsequent five years) after enactment of this law. Interpretive rules and guidance, which may have the force and effect of rules and can be used to get around rulemaking requirements, also can be added to the list. A final schedule must be published a year later, addressing public comment. This final schedule can be revised if the agency grants a petition requesting a change in the priority of a rule or to amend or repeal a major rule. The deadline for the review of any rule cannot be longer than ten years from the date of the initial publication of the final schedule. However, the agency head can extend the deadline for review of any rule by up to two additional years (i.e., total agency review time alone can be 12 years). Two years before the deadline for review, the agency must notify the public and solicit comments on the rule and address these comments in a published notice within a year before the deadline. The agency still has two years after the deadline for review to promulgate a revised rule if that is the action that the agency chooses to take. If no action is taken within the two years, the rule would expire. 
<p>
	 Opponents of "look-back" provisions argue that it would be a cumbersome, costly process for agencies. Unfortunately, Section 623 adds a provision that requires the President's budget for each agency to "identify as a separate sum" the amount requested to implement the section. If an agency does not want to carry out this provision of the law, it may fail to request money for implementation, which the President and Congress may support. This provision -- at the heart of regulatory relief -- is seriously weakened by allowing it to be undermined through the budget process.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	For regulatory reform legislation to be effective, it must force regulatory agencies to behave differently. It must force them to base their regulatory decisions on costs, benefits, and actual risks faced by Americans and force them to use sound data to make these calculations and state clearly what non-measurable factors shaped the design of the regulation. Once a regulation is promulgated, reform legislation must give the public much greater power to force reviews of existing rules that do not meet these tests. And legislation must hold agencies accountable, under judicial review, for their regulatory actions.
<p>
	Senator Dole was doing regulatory reform the right way before the Senate Democrats and the Clinton Administration got in the way. While the intent of most sponsors of the current Senate draft is a bill that would achieve the objectives of real reform, the language of the bill itself is so flawed that it would not achieve these intentions. Indeed, in many areas the language actually would insulate agencies further from proper accountability. The Dole/Johnston bill as currently drafted could be a setback for regulatory reform.

<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
 <P>
In an effort to ease the burden of federal red tape, Representatives Tom 
DeLay (R-TX) and David McIntosh (R-IN) and Senators Don Nickles (R-
OK), Christopher Bond (R-MO), and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) have 
introduced legislation (H.R. 450/S. 219) to place a moratorium on executive 
branch regulatory activities. The purpose of the bills is to provide for a "tim
out" period, during which the Congress and the Administration can debate and 
study the large number of regulations currently being written and consider 
pending reforms aimed at improving the way in which rules are written. 
<P>
Congress is right to be concerned about the heavy burden of regulation on the 
economy. The departing Bush Administration estimated in 1993 that 
regulation cost the economy $542 billion in 1991 and that the cost would 
increase to $662 billion by the year 2000. Using different calculations less 
than a year later, the Clinton Administration placed the cost of federal 
regulation to the economy at the still very high figure of "at least $430 billi
annually." Despite these figures, the Administration's November regulatory 
agenda indicates plans to issue 872 final rules in the upcoming months. 
Private sector analysis of just two of eight proposed rulemakings from one 
agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 
estimates these rules would cost business billions of dollars annually to 
implement. 
<P>
Before introducing the legislation, the Republican leadership first asked the 
President in a letter to declare a 100-day moratorium himself. The 
Administration refused, calling the freeze a "blunderbuss that could work in 
unintended ways." A moratorium, however, would not stop rules that would 
ease unnecessary federal red tape or address imminent threats to public safety.
The moratorium legislation is designed instead to provide both the 
Administration and the Congress with two important opportunities: 
<P>
Congressional committees and the Administration will gain a review period to 
examine rules that are in the pipeline and the chance to determine whether the 
Administration's own regulatory review processes are working. 
<P>
Congress will have an opportunity during the moratorium period to debate the 
regulatory process reforms included in such measures as the House 
Republicans' Contract With America, including risk assessment and cost-
benefit reform, paperwork reduction, a regulatory budget proposal, and 
private property rights reform. 
<P>
<B> HOW THE PROPOSED MORATORIUM WOULD WORK</B>
<P>
The Regulatory Transition Act of 1995 would halt agency rulemaking dating 
back to November 9, 1994, and extending until June 30, 1995. Rulemaking 
activities that would be covered by the moratorium thirty days after the bill's
enactment include substantive or interpretative rules, statements of agency 
policy, notices of inquiry, and advance notices and regulatory notices of 
proposed rulemakings. 
<P>
The moratorium also would include regulatory actions covered by statutory 
and court deadlines. Any deadline would be extended for five months or until 
July 1, 1995, whichever is later. So the public would know what rulemakings 
and deadlines would be covered by the moratorium, the President would be 
required within thirty days to publish the list in the Federal Register. 
<P>
The purpose of the legislation, however, is to suspend only burdensome 
regulations. Thus, it exempts from the moratorium those rules that would 
streamline or reduce regulatory or administrative actions and license and 
registration approvals. It is no "blunderbuss." Despite Administration official
claims, it is not intended, for example, to block the Administration's proposal
to streamline federal procurement rules. The legislation also would allow the 
President, through executive order, to waive the moratorium for actions 
necessary because of imminent threats to public health and safety. 
<P>
<B> THE REGULATIONS THAT WOULD BE COVERED</B>
<P>
A principal stimulus for the regulatory moratorium is the large number and 
wide scope of federal regulatory actions now under way. The moratorium 
would allow these regulations to be examined, while lawmakers at the same 
time could streamline and improve the regulatory process itself. The actions 
listed below, which have been estimated to cost close to $50 billion, are only 
a sample of the pending rulemaking actions that would be covered under the 
moratorium: 
<P>
Indoor Air Quality. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) would be prevented from promulgating a rule to require restaurants, 
retailers, office building owners, and others to implement comprehensive 
indoor air and ventilation plans. The rule would require these businesses, as 
well as manufacturers, to ban cigarette smoking unless smoking takes place in 
separately ventilated rooms. OSHA estimates that the rule would cost 
employers $8.1 billion annually. 
<P>
Ergonomics (Also Called Repetitive Motion Disease). OSHA currently is 
working on a rule that would require employers to take a number of actions to 
address repetitive motion injuries. These are injuries due to repeated hand, 
wrist, or other physical motions that cause or aggravate musculoskeletal 
disorders. Employers would be required not only to have written plans to 
prevent these injuries, but also to take actions to redesign work areas, such a
desks and computer set-ups, to slow assembly lines, and potentially to pay for 
medical bills. Private industry estimates that a similar rule proposed by 
California-OSHA would cost $3.1 billion annually in that state alone. Other 
sources estimate the federal rule would cost $21 billion to implement. 
<P>
Race and Gender Disclosure Rules. The Federal Reserve Board would be 
prevented from issuing final rules under the Community Reinvestment Act. 
Specifically, the moratorium would stop work on a requirement that banks 
and thrifts report race and gender data of small businesses and farmers 
seeking loans for $1 million or less. This proposal, incidentally, contradicts 
another Federal Reserve rule that prohibits institutions from collecting such 
data on loan applications. 
<P>
Labeling of Sunglasses. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would be 
stopped from any further work on a rule to require labeling of sunglasses. 
According to the Administration's regulatory agenda, the purpose of this 
proposal (which is still in the pre-rule stage) is to make sure consumers are 
aware that overexposure to ultraviolet radiation could hurt their eyes. 
<P>
Paper Industry "Cluster Rules." The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
has proposed what it terms "cluster rules" for the paper industry. Basically, 
these rules combine requirements under the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. 
While the EPA claims the new rules would simplify existing regulations, 
many businesses say they actually complicate them. According to the paper 
industry, the rules would cost $11 billion in capital expenditures. According 
to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the EPA admits "the new rules would force 
33 mills to close; 21,000 people would lose their jobs." 
<P>
Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative. The EPA's Great Lakes Initiative would 
impose uniform standards for water quality on eight different states in the 
Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin). The EPA first proposed the initiative on April 
16, 1993, and is required by court order to issue the rules on March 13, 1995. 
The EPA estimates that the proposal could cost from $80 million to $500 
million annually. But in a study conducted for the Council of Great Lakes 
Governors, DRI-McGraw Hill estimated that it would cost over $2 billion per 
year and up to 33,000 jobs lost. According to the Great Lakes Water Quality 
Coalition, which consists of local governments, businesses, and agricultural 
interests in the region, the initiative will not "significantly improve" water 
quality and "does not address the predominant sources of chemical pollutants 
into the Great Lakes Basin -- air deposition and stormwater runoff." 
<P>
Clean Air Act: California Federal Implementation Plan (FIP). The EPA is 
required by judicial deadline to issue in February its final federal plan to pu
three areas in California (Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Ventura) in 
compliance with the air quality requirements in the 1977 Clean Air Act. The 
1,700- page draft plan would impose draconian limits on emissions, ranging 
from factories to automobiles and trucks and even to lawn mowers. The EPA 
estimates that the FIP could cost Californians between $4 billion and $6 
billion annually. According to the State of California, when the FIP is fully 
implemented in 2010 the "losses will total at least $8.4 billion in direct cost
$17.2 billion in output, and 165,000 jobs." This estimate does not include the 
impact on transportation firms in the rest of the state that are affected by th
rule. 
<P>
<B> RECOMMENDED ACTIONS DURING THE MORATORIUM</B>
<P>
These proposals are only a sampling of the hundreds being worked on by 
federal agencies which together would impose many billions of dollars in 
regulatory burdens on the economy. A regulatory moratorium would allow 
Congress and the Administration to review the justifications for these rules to
see whether they follow the standards set by the Administration and should be 
allowed to move forward. Even more important, Congress also should use the 
interval to work on legislation that would roll back burdensome rules and 
overhaul the regulatory process. 
<P>
Clinton's Regulatory Review. According to President Clinton's executive 
order on regulatory review, the White House Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and the federal agencies are supposed to weigh a 
number of factors when deciding to regulate. Specifically, the executive order 
requires that agencies planning to issue "significant rulemakings" (those 
estimated to cost more than $100 million annually) must analyze their costs, 
benefits, and possible alternatives.Although not a specific requirement, 
agencies are encouraged when setting regulatory priorities to consider the 
risks posed by "various substances or activities within its jurisdiction." 
Agencies also are required under the order to have a process by which they 
can review existing regulations. 
<P>
During the moratorium period, Congress and the Administration should 
review at least the ten or fifteen proposals expected to impose the largest 
burden on the economy to see whether agencies actually are following the 
Administration's own requirements to conduct cost-benefit analyses, consider 
risks, and look for less costly alternatives. The high cost of the regulations 
mentioned above raises questions about how closely the agencies are adhering 
to the executive order. In addition, Congress should review issues brought up 
in the Clinton Administration's own six-month review of the order. For 
example, although OIRA Administrator Sally Katzen stated that they had 
"made a very good start in implementing" it, she admitted that "the start-up 
time for various provisions of the Order has taken longer (and in some cases a 
lot longer)" than anticipated, such as agency review of existing regulations. I
addition, the report listed items for further consideration, such as how 
agencies determine which rules are "significant" and whether the definition 
needs to be clarified; whether executive branch review time limitations are 
sufficient -- especially for significant rules; and post hoc evaluation of rule
determine whether initial estimates were correct and the results expected 
achieved. 
<P>
OSHA's proposed rulemaking on indoor air quality is one example of a rule 
that would benefit from closer scrutiny. According to the Administration's six-
month review, OIRA spent only nine days reviewing an $8 billion-a-year 
regulation. Given OSHA's propensity for past regulatory excesses, this rule 
warrants more study. In addition, the agency's scientific justification for the
rule relies heavily on a controversial EPA second-hand smoke study. 
Congress, last year, almost passed legislation that would have given the EPA 
authority to conduct further studies and to educate the public and inspectors 
regarding "indoor air quality" or "sick building syndrome." Although the 
legislation states that the EPA is supposed to coordinate with OSHA, in 
certain cases the two agencies' responsibilities appear to overlap. 
<P>
The "Contract" Regulatory Reforms. Placing a freeze on most regulatory 
activity also would give Congress an interval within which to consider 
regulatory reforms such as those included in the House Republicans' Contract 
With America, as well as others introduced in the Senate. The unifying 
purpose of these proposals is to establish a more thorough system of scrutiny 
for proposed regulations than exists under current law and the Clinton 
executive order. 
<P>
The Contract With America contains major regulatory reforms which have 
been introduced by Representatives Bill Archer (R-TX), Tom DeLay (R- TX), 
Billy Tauzin (D-LA), Lamar Smith (R-TX), and others as the Job Creation 
and Wage Enhancement Act of 1995 (H.R. 9). The reforms include putting in 
place risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis procedures for regulations, a 
regulatory budget to control the cost of regulations, improvements in the 
Paperwork Reduction and Regulatory Flexibility Acts, and compensation for 
private property owners for government "takings" of their property. Most of 
these provisions were introduced in both Houses last year as separate pieces 
of legislation and came close to passage. 
<P>
Three reforms, in particular, would dramatically improve the current 
regulatory process: risk assessment/cost-benefit analysis, a regulatory budget,
and private property rights reform. Specifically: 
<P>
Congress should require agencies to base rules on sound science and to 
prioritize. 
<P>
Action should be taken to stop government from restricting private property 
to enforce environmental regulations. Out of simple fairness, the government 
should be required to reimburse property owners if a regulation restricts their
right to use their land. 
<P>
Debate over these measures, moreover, would help lay the needed 
groundwork for enactment of a regulatory budget. This reform would place a 
ceiling on the total estimated cost that could be imposed on the economy each 
year by all federal regulations. The agencies must improve their ability to 
estimate the cost of regulations and to prioritize before a regulatory budget 
can work or be enacted by Congress. 
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION 
</B>
<P>
Both the Clinton Administration and the new leadership in Congress have 
called for improving the regulatory process and easing the burden of red tape. 
Neither branch of government, however, has acted either to curb the volume 
of new rules or to lower the cost of regulations now in the pipeline. A 
regulatory moratorium would give both the Administration and Congress time 
to rethink current regulations and enact reforms to ease the impact of future 
rules.

INTRODUCTION
 
<P>    Congress may act soon on legislation to reauthorize the 1980 
Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
(CERCLA, pronounced sir-kluh), also known as Superfund. As it is 
enforced, Superfund is perhaps the most complex existing law. But it 
is now synonymous with failure and has become a symbol of wasteful, 
ineffective environmental legislation. 

<P>The Clinton Administration agrees that the Superfund law has not 
worked, and last February unveiled its reform proposals. These 
proposals have been substantially incorporated into two bills before 
Congress: S.1834, introduced by Senator Max Baucus (D-MT), who is 
Chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works; and H.R. 
3800, introduced by Representative Al Swift (D-WA), the Chairman of 
the Transportation and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee of the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce.

<P>Although $20 billion has been spent already on the 
program,Superfund has failed in its mission to clean up hazardous 
waste sites. So far, only a small fraction of the "worst" hazardous 
waste sites have been cleaned up. To clean up the remaining sites will 
cost hundreds of billions more. Unfortunately, the legislation fails 
to address the two fundamental problems that have created this 
situation.<P>
Specifically, the legislation:
<P>
Retains the law's retroactive, strict, joint and several liability 
scheme. 

  <P>   This delays site cleanup as responsible parties attempt to avoid 
liability by shifting it to others. Moreover, it adds to total site 
cleanup costs by creating a climate for increased litigation and other 
transaction costs.
<P>
Maintains overly stringent and inflexible cleanup standards.
   
<P>  Unreasonable cleanup standards are the other major factor behind 
the slow and costly pace of site cleanup. The current system not only 
fails to prioritize those sites posing the most significant risk, it 
also imposes excessive standards of "cleanliness."

 <P>    Instead of fixing these fundamental problems, the bills create 
the Environmental Insurance Resolution Fund (EIRF), funded by an 
unnecessary and inequitable $8.1 billion tax on the insurance and 
reinsurance industry. The purpose of this fund is to settle the 
problem created by current law that virtually forces companies to sue 
the insurance industry because the extent of insurer liability is not 
easily settled. This fund, built on retrospective and prospective
taxes, helps some insurance companies at the expense of others and 
still would leave insurers open to future risk.

<P>     The right solution would be to repeal retroactive, joint and 
several liability and fix the cleanup standards. By doing this, only 
the most needy sites would be cleaned up. Instead of the l itigious 
scramble for the responsible party and the ensuing litigation, the 
polluter would pay. For those sites where no one is legally 
responsible under the new law, the federal government should decide if 
they warrant cleanup, and if so, clean them up.

<P>     In addition, the bills contain other provisions that do nothing 
to fix the Superfund program and will only add to the cost of the bill 
and the cost of cleaning up hazardous sites, such as new Davis-Bacon 
Act expansions in the House bill. These have no place in such 
legislation.

<P>     The many problems with these bills underscore the need to move 
cautiously on Superfund reform rather than to rush through a bill in 
the final days of this Congress. With exploding costs on the horizon 
caused by Superfund's flaws, real reforms are necessary now. These 
bills, however, would virtually guarantee five years more of the 
status quo until the next reauthorization. If Superfund reform cannot 
be done right this year, it should not be done. 

<P>WHAT IS SUPERFUND?

<P>     The Superfund program was created in 1980 after widespread media 
attention to the exposure to high levels of dangerous chemicals of 
residents of Love Canal, near Niagara Falls, New York. The national 
media coverage thus provided the political impetus for legislative 
action. (It is  important to note that the company that buried the 
chemicals in the area, Hooker Electrochemical Company, took great care
to prevent public exposure to the chemicals.  Hooker buried the 
chemicals sealed in a thick protective tube of   impermeable clay with 
the intent of maintaining ownership of the land.  Unfortunately, the 
Niagara Falls Board of Education through threat of eminent domain, 
effectively forced the company to sell the land (for $1), despite the
company's warmings that the land was contaminated and not fit for 
public use.  A public elementary school was built on the site and city 
construction crews bulldozed through the clay seal, thus allowing the 
chemicals into the surrounding soil.  Additionally, some of the land 
was sold off for residential housing.  Thus, the problems at Love 
Canal were the direct result of government interference.) 

<P>     Superfund, known formally as the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), was intended to 
force companies to clean up their hazardous wastes. It also created a 
government fund to pay for cleanup of "orphan sites," which are 
contaminated properties where the polluter, say, has gone out of 
business. (42 U.S.C.  sec.  9601 et.  seq.; PL 96-510, as amended by 
97-216, July 18, 1982; PL 97-272, September 30, 1982; P.L.  98-45, 
July 12, 1983; PL 99-160, November 25, 1985; PL 99-499 (Superfund 
Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA)), October 17, 1986; 
PL 100-202, December 22, 1987; PL 101-144, November 9, 1989; PL 101- 
508, November 5, 1990; PL 101-584, (Superfund Surety Bonding),
November 15, 1990; PL 102-389, October 6, 1992; and PL 102-426, 
October 19, 1992.) The law was hurried through in the final days of 
the Carter Administration and many provisions were ill-considered. 
Consequently, CERCLA has cost approximately $20 billion or more while 
utterly failing in its mission of cleaning up hazardous waste sites. 
As Carol Browner, Administrator of the Environmental Protection  
agency (EPA), explains, "A lot of time and money is taken up with 
companies suing each other over how much they owe to clean up a 
particular site." (Remarks by EPA Administrator Carol Browner to the 
U.S.  Chamber of Commerce Policy Insiders Breakfast, February 16, 
1994.)
<P>
     To deal with orphan sites, Congress originally authorized a $1.6 
billion trust fund, or "Superfund." This sum was believed adequate by 
policy makers to clean up all orphan sites known or likely to be 
discovered. For many reasons, however, the program proved much more 
expensive. In 1986, the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act
(SARA) increased the trust fund by another $8.5 billion, to $10.1 
billion. The total was raised by another $5.1 billion, to $15.2 
billion, during the 1990 budget deal. The increases were financed 
through excise taxes, primarily on crude oil and petrochemicals, as 
well as a corporate environmental tax. Of this amount, $10.8 billion 
had been spent by the end of fiscal year 1994. (The 1994 figure 
includes estimated outlays for Fiscal Year 1994, which funds through 
September 1994.  The cost in real dollars is $12.2 billion.)

<P>     The $10.8 billion spent so far from the Superfund, moreover, 
comprises only a fraction of the total cost of CERCLA. The cost spent 
by companies and individuals in compliance with CERCLA has raised the 
overall price tag of the program by billions of dollars more. 
(Estimates vary greatly -- from $7.8 billion to $18 billion -- and 
typically are not based on solid data; nevertheless, there is uniform
agreement that the costs have been substantial.)

 <P>    Much of this cost has been spent not on cleanup, but on
litigation and other "transaction" costs. In fact, only 237 of the 
1,292 "worst" hazardous waste sites placed on the National Priorities 
List (NPL), or about 18 percent, have been cleaned up. (EPA Superfund 
Hotline run by Booz-Allen & Hamilton, as of September 23, 1994.  Note 
that some of those cleaned up sites, technically known as 
"construction  completed," actually are undergoing long-term 
remediation.  Also note that by the end of 1992, from which time many
of the cost figures for various studies were derived, only 149 of 
1,275 on the NPL had been cleaned up.) Moreover, only 60 sites have 
been deleted from the NPL. To clean up the remaining sites already on 
the NPL, the EPA's costs alone -- excluding costs to businesses and 
insurance companies -- will run an estimated $40 billion. Also, many 
more sites are expected to be listed on the NPL -- for an ultimate 
number between 2,100 to 10,000 -- thus driving up the costs even
higher. (Congressional Budget Office, "The Total Costs of Cleaning Up 
Nonfederal Superfund Sites," January 1994, citing Milton Russell, E.  
William Colglazier, and Mary R.  English, Hazardous Waste Remediation:  
The Task Ahead (Knoxville, Tenn.:  University of Tennessee, Waste 
Management Research and Education Institute, 1991); and the Office of 
Technology Assessment, Coming Clean:  Superfund Problems Can Be 
Solved....   (October 1989).) Over the next thirty years, according to 
the General Accounting Office, total costs are estimated at $300 
billion in 1990 dollars. (General Accounting Office, "Superfund 
Program Management," High Risk Series, December 1992.) The 
Congressional Budget Office, on the other hand, has put the total 
costs of cleaning contaminated sites not owned by the federal
government at between $106 billion and $463 billion in nominal 
dollars, or $42 billion and $120 billion in discounted dollars, over 
the next 78 years. (CBO, "The Total Costs of Cleaning Up Nonfederal 
Superfund Sites," January 1994.  The baseline projection in nominal 
dollars was estimated at $228.3 billion, or $73.9 billion in 
discounted dollars.  To calculate the discounted costs, the study used
a discount rate of 7 percent, which biased the study's  discounted 
costs downward.  While proper if the figure being calculated was 
return on investment (ROI) -- or payback on a present cost--to ensure 
a conservative estimate, it should not be used to estimate future 
costs.) The lion's share of those costs will be incurred within the 
next two decades, with annual costs potentially reaching a peak of 
$14.4 billion by the year 2003. (Ibid.  Note that this figure is the 
high case estimate in undiscounted dollars for cleanup of non-federal 
facilities.  The base case and low case estimates are $9.1 billion and 
$4.4 billion, respectively.  Inclusion of federal facilities in cost 
estimates, of course, would result in significantly higher estimates.)
If the costs of cleaning up federal facilities are added into the 
equation, the total cost could exceed $750 billion or about $7,800 per 
household in America. (Kent Jeffreys, "Science, Economics, and 
Environmental Policy:  A Critical Examination," Alexis de Tocqueville 
Institution, Arlington, Virginia, August 11, 1994, citing Milton 
Russell et al., Hazardous Waste Remediation.  The author calculated 
the potential average household cost by dividing the total by the 
number of households in the United States, or 96.391 million, in 1992, 
according to U.S.  Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, 
Current Population Reports, "Money Income of Households, Families, and 
Persons in the United States:  1992.")
<P>
WHY SUPERFUND DOES NOT WORK

<P>     The high cost and slow pace of Superfund cleanups are caused 
principally by two problems: the program's unworkable liability scheme 
and its overly stringent cleanup standards. The law's retroactive, 
strict, joint and several liability scheme results in endless 
litigation as potentially liable parties search for the "deepest 
pockets" to pay for cleanup. In addition, parties can be held liable 
for cleanup whether or not they are at fault, even if they dumped only 
minute amounts of waste and regardless of whether the dumping was
legal at the time. The program's unreasonable cleanup standards 
require hazardous waste sites, no matter what the location, be 
excessively clean and fail to set up a priority system that ensures 
the maximum bang for the cleanup buck.
<P>
The Liability Scheme Is Unworkable

<P>     The most important reason why the Superfund has failed to clean 
up more hazardous waste sites is its highly unusual liability scheme. 
This retroactive, strict, joint and several liability system delays 
cleanups and increases total costs by fueling constant litigation.

<P>     This liability scheme has led to countless examples of absurd and 
grossly unfair results. For instance, Russ Zimmer was named as one of 
the "potentially responsible parties" (PRP) ("Potentially Responsible 
Party," usually referred to by its acronym PRP, is the legal term 
referring to a person or institution that is identified as a liable 
party under CERCLA's liability scheme.  This term also is applicable
before any court determination of liability, as the word "potentially" 
implies.) for a Superfund site located at a battery cracking plant in 
Torrington, Wyoming. His  contribution to the problem? He sold a bag 
of dog food in 1977 and a bag of seed in 1984, and took a third-party 
check as payment for the items. Since the checks originally had been 
issued by the now-bankrupt company that had owned the battery cracking 
plant, Zimmer was sued as a PRP. Zimmer decided upon advice from 
counsel that he should settle or it would cost him even more in legal 
costs. So he agreed to pay $3,500. (Jack Anderson, Michael Binstein, 
"How Superfund Hurt the Innocent," The Washington Post, March 7, 1994,
p.  C11.)

<P>     Joint and several liability is much to blame for causing legal 
woes such as Zimmer's. Under joint and several liability, a person who 
contributed even a very small amount to a problem, such as by tossing 
a car battery into a landfill, can be held responsible for the entire 
cost of, say, a multi-million dollar cleanup. (Special rules apply now 
to very small (de minimis) contributors, but the problem discussed 
nevertheless still exists for many extremely small, as well as 
moderate, contributors.  The bills before Congress offer a partial 
solution to the current system by exempting truly tiny (de micromis) 
contributors, but the bills would not eliminate the problem because 
they would have the burden of proving a negative -- that they did not
pollute more -- to qualify for the exemption.  Moreover, moderate 
polluters would remain subject to enormous liability.) 

<P>     The concept is designed to find somebody -- anybody -- to pay for 
cleanups of hazardous waste. Under the doctrine, the "responsible" 
person presented with the tab often has no part or only a small part 
in creating the waste problem. In practice, this means that a firm 
with "deep pockets" ends up paying for the cleanup of wastes created 
by someone else. Naturally, any person or institution identified as a 
PRP has a strong incentive to prove that others are liable as well, in 
order to dilute the costs among more PRPs. Hence, litigation is 
virtually assured.

<P>     Although EPA Administrator Carol Browner has admitted the need 
for reform, she justifies Superfund's liability scheme because "a lot 
of good has come from the program. The polluter-pays concept that was 
first adopted in the Superfund law has changed the way businesses in 
this country deal with their waste." Unfortunately, Superfund does not
adopt the "polluter-pays" system, but rejects it. By  imposing joint 
and several liability, Superfund guarantees people like Zimmer pay for 
cleaning up the pollution of others. In short, joint and several 
liability works against the idea of making polluters pay the costs 
that their actions impose on others -- no more, no less. (For a clear
elucidation of the principle as properly defined, see John Shanahan, 
"The Conservative As Environmentalist," Heritage Lecture No.  358, 
November, 19, 1991.) 

<P>     Perhaps the most controversial part of this liability scheme is 
the retroactive component. (Retroactivity is not expressly provided 
for in the text of CERCLA, but that it is clear from the usage of the 
past tense that Congress intended for it to be retroactive.  Moreover, 
the courts have correctly interpreted that the intent of the law was
to impose retroactive liability.) Retroactive liability means that 
owners, operators, and other individuals and companies who otherwise 
would be liable under the strict, joint and several standards are held 
responsible for pollution that took place before the Superfund law was
passed in 1980. For instance, if a company made jeep parts during 
World War II, and during production some chemicals seeped into the 
ground, the company would be legally responsible for the cost of 
cleaning up those chemicals now. Thus, because of a law passed more 
than 35 years later, the company may be faced with tens of millions of 
dollars in cleanup costs -- even though the company's actions not only
were completely legal at the time, but were considered patriotic. (For 
many defense contractors, liability has amounted to hundreds of 
millions of dollars.)
<P>
     There are essentially three problems with retroactive liability. 
<P>
     Retroactive liability is of questionable constitutionality. The 
standard is seemingly unconstitutional on its face. In the same part 
of the Constitution that authorizes the existence of Congress, it
clearly and unequivocally states that "No... ex post facto Law shall 
be passed." (U.S.  Constitution, Article I, Section 9, Clause 3.) An 
ex post facto law is defined as "the infliction of punishment upon a 
person for an act done which, when it was committed, was innocent... 
[or] every law which, in relation to the offense or its consequences,
alters the situation of a person to his disadvantage." (Henry Campbell 
Black, M.A., Black's Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition (St.  Paul, Minn.:  
West Publishing Co., 1990).) 

 <P>    Superfund very clearly is an ex post facto law because
individuals and companies are surely punished and their situations 
"altered to disadvantage" when the government requires them to spend 
perhaps tens of millions of dollars to atone for actions that were 
legal when done. The intent of the Founding Fathers is clear, yet that 
intent has not been rigorously upheld by the Supreme Court. Relatively
early in the history of the nation, in fact, the Court held that the 
prohibition against ex post facto laws applied only to either criminal 
or penal measures. (Calder v Bull, 3 U.S.  (3 Dall.) 386, 1 L.Ed.  648 
(1798).) Thus, an important question is whether the imposition on a 
single person of liability for millions of dollars is penal by nature.
When individuals and companies may be bankrupted based on their own 
past behavior -- as opposed to, say, compliance with general 
regulations -- it is difficult to conceive of a law that could be more 
penal without being criminal.

  <P>   Even in cases where a statute was not considered penal, the Court 
traditionally ruled against retroactive laws. (See Railroad Retirement 
Board v.  Alton Railroad Co., 295 U.S.  330, 55 S.Ct.  758, 79 L.Ed.  
1468 (1935).  The Court bias against retroactive laws has not solely 
rested on the ex post facto law prohibition, but also has rested on 
several other constitutional grounds such as the due process.) In the 
last twenty years, however, there has been a shift in the 
interpretation. A relatively modern case that squarely addresses ex 
post facto "non-penal" laws suggests that, if ruled on, Superfund 
could be held constitutional if it is found to be rationally related 
to a legitimate government purpose. (Usery v.  Turner Elkhorn Mining 
Co., 428 U.S.  1, 96 S.Ct.  2882, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976).) This is 
considered a low legal hurdle to overcome. In addition, lower court 
decisions have found that the prohibition against ex post facto laws 
poses no constitutional barrier to Superfund's retroactivity. (See 
U.S.  v.  Northeastern Pharmaceutical & Chemical Co., Inc., 810 F.2d 
726 (8th Cir.  1986), cert.  den., October 5, 1987.  The fact that the 
Supreme Court declined to hear this case lends some weight to the 
belief that the Court supports the 8th Circuit court's decision, but 
does not set Supreme Court precedent.) To date, however, the Supreme 
Court has not squarely addressed the issue of Superfund retroactivity.

 <P>    Retroactive liability is unfair. Fairness is another problem with 
retroactive liability. It is unfair to hold people accountable today 
for actions taken decades ago, perhaps by a previous owner of the land 
with several intervening owners. Yet the law, as enforced, does just
that. Thus, a farmer may find that his grandfather -- or indeed, 
someone whom he has never heard of -- fouled the sub-soil 50 years 
earlier using state-of-the-art equipment, and the farmer must fix the 
entire problem, no matter how much it costs. Even if the farmer caused 
the problem himself back in the 1960s, is it really fair to assume 
that a law-abiding citizen should know that his actions -- reasonable
at the time -- could destroy his children's inheritance of the family 
farm? Not only environmental sensitivity, but environmental knowledge 
has increased exponentially since that time.

<P>     Retroactive liability has triggered an avalanche of litigation. 
The third problem with this liability scheme is a very practical one: 
it leads to constant litigation. Litigation probably is the biggest 
contributor to Superfund's failure to achieve its primary objective of
cleaning up hazardous waste sites. 

  <P>   Perhaps the most important practical problem is that
retroactivity increases the raw number of PRPs for any given site. 
Numerous individuals and companies may have owned the land over the 
decades. Moreover, each of the previous owners typically had dealings 
with others who might be liable. When the fact that large numbers of 
owners and other potentially liable parties often have poor records, 
it is little wonder that those already targeted by the EPA as deep 
pockets turn to the courts to defray the costs.

 <P>    Another problem is that records for actions taken decades ago can 
be difficult to obtain. If an entrepreneur conducted regular business 
in the 1950s through the 1970s with a chemical company that created a 
hazardous waste site, he usually would not have kept records dating 
back that far. He would be ill-suited to defend himself in court 
against canceled checks and other such records from the chemical
company. His own culpability may be small or nonexistent, but without 
records of his own, the evidence may point to his liability. Moreover, 
since the law also is strict, joint and several, the entrepreneur is 
potentially liable for the entire cleanup if he has the deepest 
pockets. Thus,  liability potentially can occur due to a failure to
maintain decades-old records. 

<P>     Another practical problem of retroactivity is that companies 
recognize the government could very well decide to increase standards 
beyond those required today. After all, retroactivity has proved no 
barrier with this law. Thus, companies are vulnerable to uncertain and 
unknowable liability costs in the future. Naturally, this further
motivates companies involved in litigation to reduce their share of 
the liability by suing as many other companies as possible. (This list 
of problems is not exhaustive, but is representative only.)

<P>     In all, transaction cost accounts for approximately 32 percent of 
total private sector CERCLA costs, although the average varies from 17 
percent to 60 percent according to firm size. (Jan Paul Acton, Lloyd 
S.  Dixon, with Deborah Drezner, Laural Hill, and Steven McKenney, 
Superfund and Transaction Costs:  The Experience of Insurers and Very
Large Industrial Firms (Santa Monica, CA:  Rand Institute for Civil 
Justice, 1992).) Litigation comprises 65 percent of this amount, or 21 
percent of the total average site cost. While this figure is 
significantly lower than the widely publicized, yet inaccurate, 
estimate of 80 percent of site cost, it nevertheless represents a 
figure of about $6.7 million per site.
<P>
Cleanup Standards Are Overly Stringent, Inflexible

<P>     The extremely high costs of actually cleaning up Superfund sites 
also contribute to delay of cleanups and litigation. Although EPA 
estimates that hazardous waste sites are a medium to low health risk, 
the average site cleanup is now estimated at $24 million to $46 
million. (Ibid.  The $32 million figure is based on 108 companies at
18 sites with annual revenues less than $20 billion between 1981-
1991.) Yet this figure is unnecessarily high because of overly 
stringent and inflexible cleanup standards. This leads to numerous and 
costly problems. (The problems discussed are not exhaustive.)

<P>     The most egregious problem was highlighted by the Office of 
Technology Assessment when it found that cleanup decisions at the 
majority of Superfund sites are based on hypothetical future risks 
rather than on actual or likely future risks. ("Coming Clean:  
Superfund Problems Can Be Solved...  ," Office of Technology 
Assessment, October 1989.  Others also have identified this problem.) 
This means that remote or inaccessible contaminated sites that pose no
current or likely future danger to people's health are given a 
priority just as high as sites that expose people to a real present 
danger. In fact, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 
announced in 1990 that under 12 percent of all Superfund sites pose an 
actual or current risk to human health or the environment. (Kathryn A.  
Kelly, Dr.  P.H., Nanette C.  Cardon, M.S., M.L.I.S., "The Myth of
10(-6) as a Definition of Acceptable Risk," EPA Watch, Vol.  3, No. 17 
(September 15, 1994), p.  8, citing reference in C.B.  Doty and C.C.  
Travis, "Is EPA's National Priorities List Correct?" Environmental 
Science and Technology Vol.  24, No.  12, pp.  1778- 1782.)

 <P>    To place sites on the National Priorities List, EPA uses a system 
known as the "hazardous ranking system" (HRS) to score sites on a 100 
point scale. If a site ranks 28.5 or above, it qualifies for the NPL. 
Yet this system has been widely criticized. As Peter Guerrero, 
Associate Director of Environmental Protection Issues at the General 
Accounting Office (GAO) stated, the HRS "utilizes an arbitrary 
criterion... not based on the risks posed by the sites." (Richard L.  
Stroup, Sandra L.  Goodman, "Rights vs.  Regulation:  How to Reform 
Superfund" (Political Economy Research Center, Bozeman, MT, September 
1994), endnote #17, p.37, citing Peter F.  Guerrero, testifying before 
the Subcommittee on Oversight of the Committee on Ways and Means, June 
11, 1992.  Serial 102-122, p.37.) 

 <P>    Another problem is CERCLA's preference for permanent cleanup, as 
opposed to on-going treatment or containment. This preference drives 
up the costs of remediation because containment and isolation are 
discouraged. Even if blanketing layers of plastic and clay on the 
soil, surrounding the property with a fence, and posting guards would 
completely eliminate exposure to the public for a small fraction of 
the cost of remediation, this option is not available. Moreover, 
Superfund is structured so that states pay only 10 percent of remedial 
construction costs, while it requires them to pay 100 percent of the 
Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs of Superfund sites in the state.
Although ongoing treatment may cost much less over the long run and 
may reduce public exposure equally well -- and in some situations, 
more -- states have a built-in incentive to demand permanent and 
extremely strict cleanup standards in an effort to avoid future O&M 
costs. Thus, states reduce their costs, but companies, through 
increased taxation, needlessly pay more.

 <P>    Another problem is that EPA uses a range of "risks" -- from one 
in ten thousand to one in a million -- to define when the probability 
of contracting cancer crosses the line from being an acceptable risk 
to an unacceptable risk. Thus, one official may consider a site to be 
"hazardous," and thus subject to CERCLA, if the risk of cancer from 
the materials at the site is one in ten thousand over a lifetime. But
another EPA official may use a risk level of one in a million. There 
is much disagreement over whether using a range of risks is proper or 
whether EPA should set a single specific risk level, or risk-point, 
that is acceptable. The more important controversy, however, centers 
not on the range argument, but on whether using a one in a million
risk of contracting cancer over a lifetime of exposure is appropriate 
at all. (Any specific numerical risk level should be at the lower end 
of the current range, and should act as a threshold floor for 
prioritizing cleanups.)

<P>     Conceptually, it helps to put this risk level in context of 
overall cancer rates. The chance of developing cancer from all causes 
is 1 in 3, or 33 percent. Thus, if a site increases the cancer risk to 
an exposed person by one in a million, it increases the person's 
overall cancer risk by only .0003 percent. This is an extremely small 
increase in the overall chances of someone contracting cancer.
Realistically, moreover, it is unlikely that many people would be 
exposed over an entire lifetime. Thus, the real cancer risk increase 
is smaller yet.

 <P>    Oddly, there is no scientific justification for choosing a one in 
a million risk level. It has "never received widespread debate or even 
thorough regulatory or scientific review. It is an arbitrary level 
proposed 30 years ago for completely different regulations,... the
circumstances of which do not apply to hazardous waste site
regulation." (Kelly and Cardon, "The Myth of 10(-6) as a Definition of 
Acceptable Risk," p.  4.) Moreover, no one seems to know how this risk 
level came to be the standard of a one in a million risk. In fact, 
when representatives of Environmental Technologies International, 
Inc., asked one federal agency where the standard came from, they were
told, "You really shouldn't be asking these questions." (Ibid.)

<P>
PROBLEMS WITH THE REFORM BILLS

<P>     Given that the Superfund program is facing hundreds of billions 
in cleanup costs in the next few years it is critical that the five- 
year reauthorization bill address these two fundamental problems. 
Unfortunately, both the House and Senate bills make only half-hearted 
attempts to address them. Instead of repealing the law's liability
scheme, it sets up instead an unwise and inequitable fund that will 
settle only part of Superfund's litigation problems. With regard to 
cleanup standards, the bills fail to adopt acceptable risk standards 
for cleanup and site prioritization. Finally, they include unnecessary
giveaways for organized labor and environmental activists that will 
only increase the cost of the Superfund program. 
<P>
Failing to Establish Real Reform in CERCLA's Liability
<P>
     Perhaps the most controversial liability reform in the bills is 
the proposed Environmental Insurance Resolution Fund (EIRF). The EIRF 
ostensibly is designed to settle the problem created under current law 
that virtually forces companies to sue the insurance industry because 
the extent of insurer liability is not easily settled. Not only does
this drive up litigation costs, but it hurts the insurance industry's 
ability to make sound business decisions. Insurance is based on 
spreading risk, which in turn is based on actuarial calculations -- in 
short, the insurance industry is built on the predictability of risk. 
Yet Superfund defeats this purpose by inserting huge uncertainties 
into the process.
<P>
     This has hurt both insurance companies offering commercial 
multiperil coverage and those insured. Some insurance companies face 
bankruptcy, and those remaining are unable to gauge their liability 
exposure for policies written decades ago. Hence, CERCLA creates 
uncertainties in premium rate setting today because insurers must 
somehow recoup these losses through cost shifting. (Moreover, the
inevitable cost shifting hurts modern companies with newer policies 
because the insurance industry's liability costs for old policies are 
shifted to them indirectly.) 

<P>  The EIRF has been proposed as a way to enable insurers to "insure 
against" this uncertainty by creating a fund financed by an $8.1 
billion tax over ten years on the entire insurance industry offering 
commercial multiperil coverage. The tax, which would be levied on both 
direct insurers and reinsurers, would fund voluntary settlements by 
PRPs. Essentially, PRPs found liable for cleanup could agree to accept 
reimbursement from the fund in exchange for agreeing to settle any 
claim they had instituted against the insurers prior to this 
reauthorization. (The bills include specific provisions as to 
eligibility, timing, and necessary documentation.  The term "insurers" 
refers to both direct insurers and reinsurers.) This often would be 
advantageous to insured companies since their liability would be 
certain and litigation costs would be reduced. The choice to accept
the settlement would be voluntary for the insured company, so even 
though an insurer pays the tax, it still could be liable for all 
existing claims depending on the PRPs' decision-making. (The 
reimbursement offer made to the PRPs would be based on a fixed 
percentage of the cleanup costs.  These fixed reimbursement rates, 
broken into categories, vary according to the state.  The amounts were 
based roughly on the relative average awards by courts against 
insurers in each state.  Thus, each state is assigned to one of three
percentage categories for reimbursement settlements:  20 percent , 40 
percent , or 60 percent.  Most states are classified in the 40 percent 
reimbursement category, with a few states in each of the 20 percent 
and 40 percent reimbursement categories.  The categories, however, are
unnecessarily limited and broad.  Also, it is claimed that at least 
two states have been miscategorized.) Moreover, since future claims 
would not be covered by the fund, insurance companies would continue 
to be exposed to uncertain risk.

<P>     If fewer than 85 percent of the PRPs potentially eligible for 
awards did not accept the fund's settlement offer within 150 days of 
the bill's enactment, however, the fund would not be created. (Note 
that there would not be a five month accumulation of money in the EIRF 
because, although taxes are being accrued through the first 150 days,
payments are due only after the fund becomes operative, if at all. 
This period could be up to 150 days (known as the contingency period).  
This is a sound approach.) If this occurs, and there really is no way 
to assess adequately the probability of reaching the 85 percent 
threshold, one of the cornerstones of the "reform" would disintegrate. 
(The reauthorization attempts to increase the likelihood of achieving 
at least 85 percent by penalizing companies that decide to take 
advantage of their right to settle the matter in court, and either 
lose or are awarded less than the settlement offer.  In such cases, 
the insurance companies' attorneys' fees must be paid by the company.  
While an effective strategy, it is unfair and only is necessary
because the reform is so timid in its overall approach to real 
reform.)
<P>
     Even if the fund became operative, and thus brought some 
predictability to the situation, the EIRF is ill-conceived. Under H.R. 
3800, 70 percent of the tax raised in the first four years is to be 
financed through retrospective taxes on net premiums charged between 
1968 and 1985. (As this paper goes to press, the taxing structure in 
S.1834 is indeterminate.  This will change, however, during mark-up of
the bill by the Senate Finance Committee scheduled for September 28.  
Most notably, the Administration has proposed that the tax on 
reinsurers be different from that on direct insurers by making the tax 
on reinsurers 100 percent retrospective.  This would address some of 
the problems discussed regarding H.R.  3800, but would not eliminate
the problems from the Senate bill.  Moreover, the financing mechanism 
that would emerge from a conference of both chambers cannot be 
accurately predicted.  Note that the 70 percent figure in the text 
accompanying this footnote applies to years one to four only.  During 
years five to ten, retroactive taxes will account for approximately 25
percent of the annual total.) But retrospective taxes simply are 
unfair. While they may not be penal in nature, they nevertheless exact 
taxes based on financial activity between 26 and 9 years into the 
past. While many insurance companies may not be adversely affected by 
the tax, since they will recoup the loss through reduced future 
liability, others will be net losers. Many of these companies might 
have been more prudent when writing policies, or for other reasons may
have smaller liability risks in relation to their premiums. (There can 
be many reasons for this situation.  Insurance companies could have 
collected higher insurance premiums per policy for their level of 
Superfund liability exposure because their policies subjected them to 
what then was perceived to be greater risks.  Conversely, they could
have insured companies, that on average, pose lower Superfund 
liability risk to the insurance company.) Yet they would be taxed just 
as much.

<P>     A prospective tax is even more unfair, and some 30 percent of the 
proposed tax for the first four years -- and 75 percent for years five 
through ten -- is prospective. The entire purpose of the EIRF is to 
settle liability uncertainties from old policies, yet a prospective 
tax is based on future policies. This means insurance companies
offering multiperil insurance coverage that cut back market share or 
were less cautious in decades past reap a windfall at the expense of 
the cautious or expanding companies. For example, Lloyd's of London 
has cut back its market share considerably, but still faces enormous 
liability for past policies. Under a prospective tax, the firm's total 
exposure is reduced considerably at the expense of American insurers,
who would pay disproportionately. While the Administration proposes to 
amend this structure in the Senate bill to eliminate prospective taxes 
on reinsurers, the problems of the EIRF's inequitable collection of 
taxes cannot be completely cured. 

<P>     Despite the Clinton Administration's assurances that the EIRF is 
a "consensus" position, only a small percentage of insurance companies 
support this tax. The over 2,000 companies opposing the EIRF typically 
are much smaller than the companies supporting the EIRF. But even so, 
those opponents represent approximately two-thirds of total premiums 
written. This hardly represents consensus in favor of the new tax. As 
Jack Ramirez, Executive Vice President for the National Association of 
Independent Insurers, stated, "We are strongly opposed to the 
insurance fund. The product they have come up with is not the 
industry's  position, although it is being represented as such." 
("House Subcommittee Approves Reform Bill; State Role, Voluntary
Cleanup Titles Added," National Environment Daily, Bureau of National 
Affairs, May 13, 1994.) Rather than impose an inequitable $8.1 billion 
tax that has limited support at best, Congress would be better served 
by dealing with one of the fundamental problems of Superfund: a flawed 
liability standard.

<P>     Another important provision also is ill-advised. The bills 
attempt to reduce legal costs by allowing companies to use an 
arbitration process in which the costs would be allocated among the 
liable PRPs. On its surface, this proposal sounds like a step in the 
right direction because it would alleviate much of the litigious 
burden of joint and several liability. However, the proposal has a 
very serious built-in problem. Many companies may be unwilling to use
this system because it is an informal process that denies them the 
protection of the normal rules of evidence and procedure in court. 

<P>     To discourage companies from rejecting a settlement offer based 
on the arbitrator's decision, any company choosing to use the courts
still would face joint and several liability. The Administration has
stated candidly that this is intended as a stick to influence
companies to choose arbitrated settlements. In fact, if a company
rejects what it considers an unfair settlement offer, the bills
expressly make the company subject to liability for the portion of the
cleanup that the arbitrator allocated to the orphan share. For
example, suppose a company sought a court ruling on a $30 million
cleanup because the company was allocated 10 percent of the liability
when it caused only one percent, or $300,000, of the problem. By
rejecting the government's settlement offer to pay 10 percent, the
company potentially would face liability for the entire $30 million.
The proposed structure thus would be severely punish companies for
seeking the legitimate protections of the court.
<P>
Limited Steps in the Right Direction
<P>
     While these provisions, and the lack of reform of the underlying
liability scheme would ensure that costs continue to explode for five
more years, not all provisions in the bills move in the wrong
direction. Although the additional provisions are only limited steps
that largely would be unnecessary if real reforms were enacted, they
nevertheless move in the right direction.
<P>
     One positive provision in the bills is lender liability reform,
which would provide needed stability to the lending industry. This is
significant because an unintended consequence of CERCLA, as now
written, is that it dries up real estate loans. As interpreted by the
courts, lenders who foreclose on properties held as collateral or
exercise financial management, perhaps to rehabilitate a loan, are
subject to Superfund's liability scheme. (For a full discussion of the
legal issues, see In Re Bergsoe Metal Corp., U.S.  Ct.  App., 9th
Cir., 910 F.2d 668 (1990).) Thus, lenders have become hesitant to make
loans based on collateral that might be subject to later litigation
under the Act. Lenders are at risk of not only losing their original
loan investment, but of becoming liable for cleanup costs of perhaps
millions of dollars. Moreover, because banks typically are "deep
pockets," they are likely to end up paying more of the cleanup costs.
So, lenders now typically require that studies be undertaken to assure
the property is free of any contamination. If it is not, an original
or refinance loan on the property is virtually impossible to obtain.
<P>
     The benefit to the government of this situation is that banks
investigate or require potential applicants to investigate properties
around the nation for contamination, thus helping it to identify
contaminated sites more swiftly and cheaply. In effect, CERCLA has
imposed an unfunded mandate on the lending industry.
<P>
     Under the pending legislation, lenders' liability essentially
would be limited to their level of investment in the mortgaged
property. This is an important step in the right direction, it stops
short of taking this concept to its logical conclusion. Lenders should
not be liable for the costs of cleaning land that may have been
polluted without their knowledge or effective control. While the
extent of liability may now be quantified, which provides needed
stability, even limited liability distorts the economic markets and
unfairly shifts the burdens of Superfund onto innocent investors.
<P>
     Another worthwhile provision would reduce the state's
contribution to Operation and Maintenance costs of cleaned sites from
100 percent to a comparably small rate consistent with construction
remediation costs. This change will reduce the incentive on states to
demand unreasonably stringent cleanup standards to "front-load" the
costs so that the federal government will pay the vast majority of the
project cost. (Under current law, although the states must pay 100
percent of future O&M costs, they are only liable for 10 percent of
the front-end cleanup costs.  The bills set a 15 percent uniform share
for state governments.  This aspect of the provision has been
criticized because it will increase the burden to the states for
front-end construction costs.) 
<P>
     Yet another useful provision would create an exemption for so-
called micromis, or truly tiny, contributors. While this is welcome
relief, it would be unnecessary were it not for the current liability
scheme. Moreover, the provision is not without problems. If
Superfund's liability scheme is kept in place, truly tiny contributors
should be relieved of the burden of proving a negative -- that they
did not contribute significantly to the pollution.
<P>
Failing to Establish Reasonable Standards
<P>
     The House and Senate bills, unfortunately, fail to correct many
of the problems created by inflexible and overly stringent cleanup
standards. Moreover, while some issues substantively would be
resolved, other standards and requirements would create new problems.

<P>     One of the most controversial provisions would deal with the goal
of protecting human health through cleanup of Superfund sites. This
new national goal "shall be expressed as a single numerical health
risk level that ensures a reasonable certainty of no harm from
exposure to carcinogens and... noncarcinogens." (S.1834, Title V, Sec. 
501.) The risk level would be decided through negotiated rule-making
which would allow EPA to set, and likely result in, an excessively
strict and expensive risk level of one in a million. This would cause
the cost of Superfund cleanups to skyrocket because it would mandate
the cleanup of extremely small risks.

<P>     Another major problem with a national goal is that it would allow
an inflexible "bright-line" for deciding when cleanup should or should
not occur. A more prudent policy would base the cleanup decision on
the risk reduced per dollar of cleanup cost. (See John Shanahan, "How
to Help the Environment without Destroying Jobs," Heritage Foundation
Memo To:  President-Elect Clinton No.  14, January 19, 1993.) Thus,
for every dollar spent on Superfund cleanup, the most immediate risks
to the public would be addressed first. Essentially, the law should be
structured to get the "biggest bang for every environmental buck." But
as the Washington, D.C.-based non-profit National Research Council
found, none of the agencies with responsibility over waste sites,
including EPA, "have developed [their] over-all priority-setting
process in a manner that is explicit, adequately documented, and
sufficiently open to scientific and public scrutiny." (Bureau of
National Affairs, National Environmental Daily, September 12, 1994,
discussing National Research Council, Commission on Geosciences,
Environment and Resources, "Ranking Hazardous Waste Sites for Remedial
Action," September 8, 1994.) But these prioritization changes, plus
similar changes in other environmental laws, would allow the greatest
risks to the public to be reduced first, regardless of the type of
environmental problem. In this way, the nation could more efficiently
spend fewer dollars while pursuing a chosen "acceptable" risk level. 

<P>     The bills grant exemptions to PRPs from achieving the new
numerical risk standard if the necessary cleanup would be either
technically infeasible or unreasonably costly. In either case, the EPA
Administrator would be allowed to set a lesser cleanup level at a cost
that, while possibly quite large, is not unreasonable. At first
glance, this seems like a reasonable step in the right direction. But
a closer look reveals that the bills further codify the use of
unnecessarily strict cleanup standards. 

 <P>    The exceptions granted in the bill are qualified by the language
that the lesser cleanup standard chosen to avoid a unreasonable cost
cannot "result in a unacceptable risk to human health.... " Thus, any
relief from unreasonable costs must result in an acceptable risk. Two
questions about this exception must be asked: 1) Why should PRPs not
granted an exception pay huge sums if lesser standards would result in
an acceptable risk? 2) What does an "unreasonable" cost mean? Either
the bills are in most cases mandating expensive cleanups to meet
excessive cleanup standards, or the exception is meaningless since
both reasonable and unreasonable costs must be set at the same risk
level -- acceptable. 

<P>     Not all provisions in the bills, however, are so poorly crafted.
To its credit, the Administration effectively exempts industrial sites
and other properties from Superfund's unnecessarily stringent
requirements. Currently, CERCLA is indifferent to the traditional or
expected future use of the contaminated property. CERCLA's standards
effectively require that the dirt be clean enough to eat. (While there
is no official standard that the soil be "clean enough to eat," it
serves as an effective criterion because of the exposure assumptions
built into the standards, such as ingestion of a certain amount of
soil per day.) While this arguably may make sense in a residential
community, it is certainly unnecessary in an industrial park where
there is little likelihood of exposure to the soil. 

<P>     As a result of these high standards, industrial operators
invariably decide to locate their plants on pristine sites in order to
avoid future liability for cleaning up another company's expensive
mess. Often, the companies that contaminated plots have gone out
business in the intervening years, so the properties have become
"orphan sites," effectively increasing the cost to the public. (While
the costs are directly levied on businesses, much of this cost is
passed on to the consumer through increased prices.  Additionally,
there are the losses to the public in the form of reduced dividends to
shareholders and income to workers for costs that companies cannot
pass on to the consumer.) Even if these sites are cleaned up,
companies have little incentive to locate on them for fear of future
litigation. Since many of these older polluted industrial sites are
located in urban areas, Superfund effectively acts as barrier to urban
revitalization. Thus, the poor and minorities, who disproportionately
live in urban areas, are the unintended victims of this policy.
(Unfortunately, the Administration through S.  1834 and H.R.  3800
unwisely attempts to address "environmental justice" through the
creation of a Superfund affirmative action plan.  An in-depth analysis
of the problems created by "environmental justice" provisions,
however, and other provisions effectively targeted to the same groups,
is beyond the scope of this paper.) The bills properly relax the
unnecessary cleanup standards by allowing the EPA Administrator to
take into account the intended and historical uses of property in
setting the standards. Thus, albeit by a circuitous path, the bills do
take into account real expected exposures for some sites. 
<P>
Financing Environmental Pork 

 <P>    The bills also contain plenty of pork barrel spending for
organized labor and environmentalists. The House bill now under
consideration contains a provision applying the Davis-Bacon prevailing
wage law to Superfund cleanup sites. (The Clinton proposal did not
include Davis-Bacon provisions.) By mandating that PRPs pay union
wages, Congress is moving in the diametrically opposite direction of
containing Superfund costs, reducing litigation, and accelerating
cleanup. There can be no justification for mandating that cleanups be
more expensive than necessary. 

<P>     Perhaps the most egregious provision, however, effectively
creates an environmental welfare program diverting Superfund's money
to environmental activists. (This provision is in both bills.) Grants
totaling up to 4 percent of the Superfund pay-out in any given year,
or approximately $63.4 million, would be given to private citizens to
investigate hazardous waste sites, including those not on the National
Priorities List. (S.1834, Title I, sec.  101.  Those sites not listed
on the NPL would be limited to 1/8th of total grant expenditures.  The
dollar figure estimate cited in the text is based on 4 percent of
estimated Superfund outlays for Fiscal Year 1995, or $1,585,979,000. 
Naturally, this dollar figure would climb as Superfund figures
climbed.) The grants may be used to hire "experts" for informational
reasons, to hire a community liaison to PRPs, "to hire experts to file
comments with the federal government and generate other documents,"
and "for training funds for interested affected citizens to enable
them to more effectively participate in the remedy selection process."
None of the rules that govern agencies in selecting experts would
apply since all decisions would be made by private citizens, although
"guidelines" would be published. Thus, the grants would be open to
large-scale abuse.
<P>
     The practical effect, if not the purpose, of this provision would
be to make it easy for environmental activists to get paid with
federal tax dollars for what they now do with voluntary donations.
Environmental activists would be able to increase the scope of their
activities as well as their payrolls. 
<P>
     Another provision in both bills pursues a completely different
environmental objective -- recycling. The bills exempt from liability
recyclers who inadvertently contaminate property with hazardous waste.
(S.1834, sec.  410, adding new section, sec.  130(j).) Essentially,
this provision would reward recyclers for their environmentally benign
intent despite the actual damage done by their physical actions. It is
ironic that polluters pursuing other societal objectives, such as
national defense and health care, which arguably are as important to
the nation as recycling, are denied this favorable status. Indeed,
this provision would shift the recycler's costs onto those other
sectors because, as written, they would have to pay the recycler's
shares. (Moreover, recyclers who have been unsuccessfully sued to pay
for site cleanup would be allowed to recover attorney's fees. 
However, this treatment is not given to other PRPs that have
successfully sued a non-qualifying recycler.  While the "English rule"
of allowing the recovery of attorney's fees is preferable to the
dominant "American rule" of no recovery of fees as a general matter,
there is no justification for this unequal treatment.  The section
also has an arbitrary cut-off date of February 3, 1994; this date
coincides with the bill's introduction.) 
<P>
A WORKABLE SOLUTION

  <P>   The best solution to the current problems with Superfund would be
to repeal retroactive, joint and several liability. With the repeal of
retroactive liability, all sites contaminated before 1980 -- when
Superfund was enacted -- would be "orphaned," meaning that no one is
liable under the law. With the repeal of joint and several liability,
moreover, whenever actual polluters that partially contaminated sites
after Superfund was enacted could not be found, their shares of the
cleanup costs would become orphan shares. Cleaning up these orphan
shares would thus require expenditures from the Superfund created for
just this purpose. If society wishes to clean up orphan sites for
which no responsible party can be found, then society should pay the
tab -- Congress should not use a tax to shift the cost to another set
of innocent "deep pockets."

  <P>   The fund, however, should not be given additional appropriations
to account for this liability scheme change. Rather, substantive
reforms should be enacted to make cleanup standards more flexible and
less stringent. These two changes, together with the lower EPA
oversight costs that would follow, would reduce the average cost of
cleanups considerably. Limiting Superfund finances in this way would
force EPA to prioritize site cleanups according to its assessment of
which sites posed an actual present threat to public safety and would
force the agency to use judgment in reducing each site's cleanup
costs. Congress should give EPA the flexibility to make these
judgments. Adding more money to Superfund, or creating the
Environmental Insurance Resolution Fund, would remove this pressure
for substantive reform.
<P>
CONCLUSION

 <P>    The Superfund reauthorization now being considered by Congress
has been touted as a major reform of the costly Superfund program,
which is widely considered one of -- if not the -- most ineffective
and unfair laws today. Unfortunately, the reforms being considered are
as disappointing as the current law. If the proposed reauthorization
becomes law, it will: create yet another fund -- this one financed
through a new $8.1 billion tax on the insurance industry; create an
"environmental pork" grant program that will benefit environmental
activists, and inequitably shift recyclers' shares of costs of
cleanups to others who often are already paying more than their fair
share. Moreover, those few reforms that make positive strides, such as
limiting lender liability, are only half-measures.
<P>
     The most striking aspect of the reform, however, is what it will
not do. It will not reform the retroactive, strict, joint and several
liability system that is causing much of the litigation now plaguing
Superfund. Nor will it do much more than tinker around the edges of
the fundamental cost drivers of cleanups -- overly strict and
inflexible standards. Hence, the most important accomplishment of this
reform will be to lock in the most unworkable provisions of the
current law for another five years during a time of exploding costs,
thus ensuring even greater waste into the future.

<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
     The Administration last spring released additional information on
President Clinton's "voluntary" 44-point plan to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions in the United States to 1990 levels by the year 2000. (When
the plan was unveiled in October 1993, the media and Administration
officials referred to it as containing 50 points or initiatives,
instead of the correct figure of 44. Even the President used the
50-point figure. The confusion stems from statements, made repeatedly
in the official plan and elsewhere, that there are "almost" or "about"
50 initiatives.) This plan is designed to address the potential threat
of global warming, or the enhanced greenhouse effect, which is the
unproved theory that man-made emissions will raise the temperature of
the Earth's atmosphere. The President's plan, as outlined, would be a
mistake for the United States and should be reviewed carefully by
Congress, the media, and the public.
<P>
     The Administration's calculation of costs and benefits is flawed
for at least five reasons:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The plan would impose more than $60 billion of unnecessary costs on
   the economy over six years.<P>
It likely would not achieve its objective.<P>
It would not, in fact, be voluntary as the Administration claims. <P>
Most qualified scientists believe catastrophic global warming
  is improbable.<P>
There are better ways to address any threat which may exist.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     In recent years, numerous research studies have contributed to
the body of knowledge of the effects of greenhouse gases on the
planet's atmosphere. These efforts continue today, with well over $1
billion spent annually on climate research. As knowledge grows more
sophisticated, however, dire predictions are being scaled back. In
fact, many of the theories upon which the belief in global warming was
based have been shown simply to be wrong. For instance, contrary to
popular opinion, satellite data show the average temperature has not
risen in the last 15 years. Instead of rushing to expensive,
ineffective, and perhaps wasteful action, policy makers should ask one
fundamental question: should the priority be to take action based on
ignorance or to lessen this ignorance through continued scientific
research? Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration has embraced the
former option.
<P>

<B> WHAT IS GLOBAL WARMING?</B>
<P>
The theory of global warming holds that man-made gases will warm up
the Earth's atmosphere, thereby endangering life on the planet. While
most Americans have heard of this theory, few understand it, and there
is widespread confusion between global warming and another term, the
"greenhouse effect."  The greenhouse effect refers to the Earth's
release of certain gases, called greenhouse gases, which enable the
atmosphere to retain some of the heat received from the sun instead of
reflecting all of it back out into space. These gases -- which include
carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide, and water vapor -- thus have
the same effect as glass in a greenhouse, keeping the Earth at a
higher average temperature, and a more even temperature, than would be
the case without them. 
<P>
     The greenhouse effect maintains a temperature which allows plant
and animal life to exist. Contrary to popular belief, all scientists
agree that the greenhouse effect is desirable; without it, life as we
know it would cease because global temperatures would plummet to an
average of -18C, or 0F. Explains Patrick Michaels, State
Climatologist for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the statement that all
scientists agree that the greenhouse effect is real "is about as
profound as a statement that all scientists agree that the Earth is
round." (Patrick Michaels, "Apocalypse Not Now: Science, Politics, and
Global Warming (Part 1)," National Chamber Foundation, U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, March 1992.)
<P>
     The theory of global warming (technically known as the "enhanced
greenhouse effect"), on the other hand, rests on the claim that
certain gases released by human activity warm the planet significantly
beyond normal greenhouse levels. These gases include carbon dioxide
and other greenhouse gases that are released naturally into the
atmosphere, (Water vapor, the primary greenhouse gas, is not increased
by human activity. Water vapor and clouds account for 98 percent of
the greenhouse effect.) along with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), man-
made gases, associated chiefly with refrigeration, that do not occur
in nature. The need for the National Action Plan was premised on the
belief that gases produced by human activity over time will increase
the greenhouse effect, leading to undesirable changes in weather
patterns, crop failures, flooding, and other damaging effects that it
would take decades to reverse. Thus, the Administration argues, action
must be taken now.
<P>

<B> THE CLINTON PLAN
</B><P>
The Climate Change Action Plan to reduce greenhouse gases was
announced by President Bill Clinton in October 1993, and an
explanatory supplement was released in late March 1994. (The Climate
Change Action Plan (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office,
October 1993) and Office of Policy, Planning, and Program Evaluation,
U.S. Department of Energy, The Climate Change Action Plan: Technical
Supplement (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, March
1994).) The plan is to form the cornerstone of the U.S. commitment to
the international Framework Convention on Climate Change. This
international agreement, which requires that a National Action Plan be
developed and submitted, was signed by President George Bush in June
1992 and became effective this year. It requires that countries reduce
greenhouse gas emissions eventually to 1990 levels and that some
progress be made by the year 2000. But President Clinton has pledged
his commitment that the United States will attain the full 1990 levels
by the year 2000.
<P>
     The plan is a potpourri of initiatives designed primarily to
encourage companies and households -- by persuasion, by education, and
in some instances by compulsion -- to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
such as carbon dioxide and methane, produced in the manufacture or use
of a product. This would be accomplished by such means as reducing
energy consumption (which produces greenhouse gases) and limiting
methane releases from garbage dumps or landfills. In all, the plan has
44 different initiatives ranging from mandates that household
appliances and buildings be made more energy-efficient to increased
government funding of the Green Lights Program, an educational program
created during the Bush Administration to show companies how they can
reduce energy consumption while saving money. Other initiatives, such
as the Source Reduction, Pollution Reduction, and Recycling
Initiative, focus on spending federal monies to persuade companies to
reduce their emissions voluntarily without legislative mandates. Yet
another initiative is designed to reduce cow flatulence through
improved techniques of beef production. The Clinton Administration's
plan relies in part on existing legislative authority to implement the
initiatives through regulatory action, but it would also require
significant additional federal spending.

<P>
<B> HOW THE COSTS ARE UNDERESTIMATED</B>
<P>
The Clinton Administration estimates that it will cost $63.4 billion
to implement this plan over the next seven years. Of this amount, the
private sector's share is $61.5 billion, the government's only $1.9
billion. (The Administration calculates a net savings of $793 million
due to increased taxes and continued leasing of dams. This projected
figure is not used here for two reasons: 1) the $1.9 billion
represents projected cost outlays, and 2) the report incorrectly shows
the tax increase that is projected to reduce the government's "net"
outlays without showing the tax as a corresponding increase in private
sector outlays.) Most of the public sector funds, it is claimed, will
be transferred from other funding sources. At the same time, the
Administration projects savings to the economy of $268.1 billion,
primarily in energy savings if the initiatives are implemented. 
<P>
     Unfortunately, the Administration's figures are highly
misleading. Specifically, the Administration underestimates how much
the plan will cost both the government and the private sector, and it
overstates projected energy savings by using flawed accounting
procedures and unduly optimistic forecasts. Experience teaches that
once government programs are born, they almost never die, yet the
Administration assumes that every government program initiated or
augmented by the plan will cease within seven years. It also assumes
that all private sector costs will drop to zero at that time. Thus,
although these programs will continue to exist, and will probably
grow, the Administration ignores all costs that will be incurred after
the year 2000 and implicitly assumes that the costs of maintaining
greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels will be zero -- while
calculating the benefits from energy savings derived from the plan
until the year 2010, or for 17 years, with benefits beyond the year
2000 included in the calculation of costs and benefits. Moreover,
while it is true that some costs borne in the early years will
continue to reap benefits for another decade, this is not true of all
programs. 
<P>
     This disparity in the calculation of costs and benefits is only
one way in which the Administration distorts the plan's true costs and
savings. Another is its highly unusual accounting method. Under the
standard method, future figures would be discounted to their present
value; the Administration, however, has chosen to calculate all cost
and benefit figures in undiscounted 1991 dollars. The result: the
plan's supposed benefits are inflated far more than its costs because
cost or benefit figures occurring further in the future are inflated
proportionately more. Thus, potential but undiscounted savings yielded
17 years from now are greatly inflated, while costs 7 years from now
are only somewhat exaggerated. This deliberate obfuscation of the real
costs and benefits indicates that the Administration knows the real
present value costs of its program exceed the real benefits discounted
for inflation and the time value of money. If the Administration truly
believes the benefits justify the costs, it should present real
figures calculated in the standard way.
<P>
     Even using this flawed accounting methodology, the Administration
significantly underestimates the probable costs and overestimates the
likely benefits of many of the plan's initiatives. Perhaps the best
example is Action #16 -- the source reduction, pollution prevention,
and recycling program -- which encourages and subsidizes increased
recycling of, and reduced use in products and packaging of, certain
natural resources such as paper, plastic, and other materials. The
plan estimates this program will cost the government and private
sector $176 million but save the economy $36.5 billion, or 207 times
as much. If such a generous return on an investment was possible, it
seems odd that entrepreneurs would have not already seized the
opportunity without the need for government encouragement. In reality,
however, recycling is expensive and generally uneconomical, with the
exception of aluminum found in such products as cans. (Aluminum cans
are both economically and ecologically beneficial to recycle because
it takes 95 percent less energy to recycle aluminum than to make it
from bauxite (aluminum ore). Of course, since recycling aluminum cans
is profitable, over 50 percent of cans already are recycled as an
entrepreneurial activity.) Thus, the cost for the private sector will
be much higher than the Administration forecasts, and benefits that
otherwise might offset these costs will be lower.
<P>
     Similarly, redesigning packaging and other products to reduce
their natural resources content is very expensive. Past trends
indicate that manufacturers already try to cut packaging costs because
packaging, which adds weight and volume to a product, is expensive to
buy, store, and transport. (Packaging accounted for 30.3 percent of
waste in 1986, down from the 1970 level of 33.5 percent. See John
Shanahan, "A Plain Man's Guide to Garbage: The Reauthorization of the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act," Heritage Foundation Issue
Bulletin No. 172, March 30, 1992.) Expensive government programs to
encourage less packaging are thus unnecessary. At worst, they can be
counterproductive by encouraging manufacturers to reduce packaging
when it is uneconomical. For instance, reducing paper packaging of
food can be counterproductive because every pound of paper packaging
reduces food waste by an average of 1.41 pounds. Thus, reductions
would waste valuable food while increasing total garbage destined for
landfills. 
<P>
     The Administration also obscures the true cost of reducing
greenhouse gases by not counting funds dedicated to efforts now
underway, or programs already announced, that comprise part of the
plan. In short, $63 billion is not the total amount to be spent on
reducing greenhouse gases; it is only the additional amount to be
dedicated to this effort. One cannot accurately gauge the true costs
either to the government or to the private sector until the White
House is more candid in estimating how much is now being spent to
fight global warming and combining that with accurate, discounted, and
itemized projections as to how much its new initiatives will cost
Americans.
<P>

<B> WHY THE PLAN WILL BE INEFFECTIVE</B>
<P>
The technical supplement explaining many of the plan's underlying
assumptions does not support the Administration's claim that the plan
will be effective. For instance, a major goal of the plan is to reduce
carbon dioxide releases, but the Administration has included in this
comprehensive package many other environmental initiatives that will
increase net carbon dioxide releases. The Administration also proposes
in Action #16 to encourage and subsidize increased recycling of paper
and other materials as a way to reduce carbon emissions, assuming that
trees left to grow instead of being cut for pulpwood will continue to
absorb carbon dioxide. But this turns the facts upside down.
<P>
     If paper recycling increases, net carbon dioxide emissions
actually will rise, not fall. Eighty-five percent of all pulpwood
comes from tree farms where the trees are planted, grown, and
harvested on about a twenty-year cycle. These smaller, fast-growing
trees absorb much more carbon dioxide than slow-growing, older trees.
Thus, by continuing to harvest every twenty years to supply the paper
market, tree farmers are encouraged to replant young carbon-absorbing
saplings. If increased paper recycling caused the virgin pulpwood
market to contract, tree farmers generally would cut down their trees
and replant their land with some other crop -- if they plant at all --
in order to make a living. The number of trees in the U.S. would drop
and net carbon dioxide releases would increase, not decrease. (This
refers to the effect of the recycling initiative alone on carbon
dioxide releases, not to total carbon releases that actually will
occur given increased production, other initiatives, and likely
technological advances. See ibid.)
<P>
     While some of the mandatory provisions no doubt would achieve
limited success at high cost, other provisions are less likely to
prove effective. For instance, Action #3 -- Establish State Revolving
Fund for Public Buildings -- assumes that providing $1 million in seed
money to ten competitively selected states each year, for a total of
$55 million through 1999, will result in energy savings of 29 percent
for one in ten state and local public buildings and two percent of all
commercial buildings. (Presumably, this statistic applies only to
commercial buildings; the technical supplement is not specific. See
Technical Supplement, op. cit.) The Administration claims that loan
repayments funded from energy savings will allow these funds to be
lent several times over; but this assumes that all energy-saving
technologies are cost-effective, and experience shows this is not
always the case. Many of these upgrades will never repay their
investment. Administration officials also make the questionable
assumption that the private sector will be motivated to spend $2.5
billion in upgrades based solely on the $55 million seed money
provided to states and localities, (The Technical Supplement
specifically states that two percent of all buildings and ten percent
of state and local buildings "are assumed to use new technologies as a
result of this action" and will thus incur the $2.5 billion investment
in energy saving technology projected under this program. Ibid.) but
this would mean investing $45 for the benefits of a $1 loan. (Even if
the Administration's assumption is correct and the $55 million could
be re-lent, say, three more times, the ratio still would be
approximately 11 to 1.)
<P>
     Another program that is unlikely to produce any significant
benefits is Action #39 -- Improve Ruminant Productivity and Product
Marketing -- which attempts to reduce cow flatulence by increasing
beef productivity. Cattle flatulence contains methane, a greenhouse
gas. The Administration assumes that a $28 million investment over six
years will increase significantly the productivity of this multi-
billion dollar industry. It proposes to achieve this goal through
improved nutrition and grazing management practices, "production-
enhancing agents to improve feed efficiency," disease control, and
improved genetic characteristics and reproduction. The White House is
correct in arguing that, if this initiative were to be successful,
less methane would be produced per pound of beef at the supermarket,
but it assumes falsely that increased beef productivity per unit will
not mean increased total beef production. In fact, increased
productivity presumably would cause lower prices, spurring greater
demand for beef and more production. While the amount of methane
produced per unit might decrease, the total amount from cow flatulence
actually could increase.
<P>
     Even the environmental lobby is skeptical of the plan's
effectiveness. As Steve Kretzman of Greenpeace said when briefed by
the Administration, "It's a repackaging of some old ideas and a few
scattered new ones. There is no guarantee that any of this will get us
anywhere. The only thing worse than this policy would have been no
policy." (Gary Lee, "Clinton Sets Plan to Cut Emissions," The
Washington Post, October 18, 1993, p. A1.)
<P>
     Echoing this sentiment, Michael Oppenheimer of the Environmental
Defense Fund, a vocal and well known advocate of the global warming
theory, said, "I have doubts as to whether even taken all together
[the 44 initiatives] can achieve reductions to 1990 levels. The
problem is that almost all of the measures are voluntary and there is
very little to encourage industry to participate and punish those who
don't." (Ibid.) But while the criticism that the U.S. will not reduce
its emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 is probably true, it is
certainly not because the plan is voluntary.
<P>

<B> THE PLAN IS FAR FROM VOLUNTARY</B>
<P>
Approximately one-half of the $63 billion plan results from mandatory
proposals. (It is impossible to know with certainty the exact costs of
the mandatory programs because the Administration's plan combines
major mandatory programs with minor voluntary programs in its cost and
saving estimates.) In Action #7, for instance, the plan proposes to
require appliance manufacturers to spend $19.5 billion to improve the
energy efficiency of household appliances. These costs in large
measure will be passed on to consumers in higher prices for
refrigerators, heaters, air conditioners, ovens, televisions, and
other appliances. The plan also calls for mandatory increases in
residential building standards under Action #10, which, according to
the Administration, will cost another $11.7 billion when combined with
two minor programs. (Ironically, this effort to seal buildings more
tightly to reduce energy loss, which will increase airborne illnesses
and hazards, comes at a time when the Administration is attempting to
address the problem of indoor air pollution.) Unfortunately, it is not
possible to know the exact projected cost for this program because the
Administration has combined the cost estimates of all three programs;
but the others appear to be minor in scope, so that costs under the
mandatory increased building standards will likely amount to nearly
all of the $11.7 billion projected for the three programs combined.
Added together, these two mandates will cost approximately $31
billion, or half of the total costs of the plan. This means that
households will spend an average of more than $300 each over the next
seven years on higher-cost houses and appliances, since these costs
largely will be passed on to consumers. Moreover, this $300 per
household is in addition to any costs that flow through companies to
consumers from the other 42 programs.
<P>
     Action #22 also calls for mandatory labeling of automobile tires
to encourage consumers to buy more fuel-efficient tires. According to
the Administration, this program would cost the private sector $2.2
billion but save fuel worth $3.9 billion. But, since the labeling
would be informational and would not itself result in energy
efficiency, it is impossible to estimate its benefits accurately.
Moreover, the Administration arrives at $3.9 billion in fuel savings
by making some rather suspect assumptions. For instance, it claims one
out of thirteen drivers will buy new tires in response to the labels,
supposedly because they will be able to drive almost a full mile
further for every gallon of gas. Thus, they will burn less gas, which
releases carbon. It is far from clear, however, that the government's
figures are accurate. In the body of the Action Plan, the government
assumes implicitly that the average car now only gets 1.7 miles per
gallon; it states that a .068 miles per gallon increase in average
fleet on-road fuel economy is a four percent increase over current
miles per gallon. Obviously, the Administration's claim is false. Yet
in the Appendix of the Action Plan, the Administration uses accurate
and fairly detailed fuel consumption figures.
<P>
     Several other provisions are also mandatory, such as pesticide
use reductions due to an Integrated Pest Management Program required
under Action #18. (The Administration assumes small energy savings
from the reduction in manufacture of pesticides, but its calculations
ignore the increased energy consumption needed to obtain the same crop
yield without pesticides, as well as the sizable increased costs
associated with pesticide reductions.)The plan does not rely solely on
inflexible "command and control" regulation. Most of the 44
initiatives are based on new "voluntary" partnerships between
government and businesses. (While "voluntary" initiatives comprise the
largest number of initiatives, it appears their cost is not more than
half the total cost of the plan.) As Secretary Hazel O'Leary said when
the plan was unveiled, "What 'voluntary' connotes is an agreement,
among parties of equal standing with full knowledge who agree, in
fact, to accomplish something." (Remarks at White House briefing,
October 19, 1993.) But, of course, companies do not have equal
standing with the federal government. This is not an agreement between
sovereign powers. Rather than take control of the method of production
directly, as many other environmental regulations do, the plan
encourages companies to sign onto "voluntary" reductions of greenhouse
gas emissions -- or face the regulatory hammer.
<P>

<B> CATASTROPHIC GLOBAL WARMING IS IMPROBABLE</B>
<P>
The enormous drain on economic resources to achieve questionable
success would cause concern even if the threat of catastrophic global
warming were real, but this assumption, on which the entire plan is
based, is under increasing challenge. According to a 1992 Greenpeace
survey, only 13 percent of climate scientists polled believe that
runaway global warming will occur, while 79 percent are split between
whether it is possible or will "probably not" occur. (Greenpeace press
release, "Climate Scientists Fear Effects of Understanding Global
Warming, Poll Shows," February 9, 1992.) This result is not
surprising. Accumulated scientific data and analyses of past studies
show that the dire predictions are either highly improbable or simply
wrong. Moreover, there is enormous uncertainty associated with the
scientific methodologies used to predict future climate changes. 
<P>
Climate change computer models that predict warming often rely on
  assumptions and oversimplifications that raise serious questions as
  to their reliability. One model, for example, effectively moved the
  Earth's orbit two million miles closer to the sun. (John Shanahan,
  "A Guide to the Global Warming Theory," Heritage Foundation
  Backgrounder No. 896, May 21, 1992.)
<P>
Models do not account accurately for the influence of important
  climate factors, such as the behavior and effect of clouds and
  oceans.
<P>
Temperature records over the last century are inconsistent with the
  predictions of global climate theories.
<P>
There are shortcomings in the data. Temperature records over the last
  century, for example, may show warming incorrectly because many
  weather stations are close to growing cities.
<P>
In contrast to measurements from ground stations, which are prone to
  various inaccuracies, more reliable satellite data collected since
  1979 show that temperatures over the last 15 years have not
  increased. (Telephone conversation with Dr. John R. Christy, Earth
  Systems Science Laboratory, University of Alabama in Huntsville. Dr.
  Christy and his co-author, Richard T. McNider, published their
  results in a January 27, 1994, letter in Nature.)
<P>
Concern about the quality of the models used is heightened further by
  the fact that they fail to predict accurately today's temperatures.
  When climate data from 50 years ago are fed into these models, they
  indicate that temperatures today should be much hotter than they
  actually are. Thus, the models contain a bias toward predicting
  hotter weather.
<P>
     Further, even if scientists were to become convinced that some
level of global warming is occurring and will continue, three
questions need to be answered.
<P>
QUESTION #1: Is the Earth warming because of human-caused greenhouse
   gases, or because of natural phenomena?
<P>
QUESTION #2: If the planet is experiencing a major warming trend, how
   will this warming take place? Will the Earth warm up substantially
   at night, perhaps cooling slightly during the day? Will the warming
   occur only in the tropical regions or only in the high latitudes
   around the poles? Will it occur in the summer or the winter? (These
   questions are important because any single figure suggesting the
   average temperature of all regions of the world for all times of
   day and night during the entire year ignores variations amid the
   warming trend that would have very different -- and not necessarily
   harmful -- effects.)
<P>
QUESTION #3: What will be the effect of any changes in the climate?
   Will the ocean levels rise, resulting in worldwide flooding, or
   fall, expanding Earth's landmass? Will worldwide agricultural
   production increase because of more crops in areas now too cold for
   major cultivation, thereby helping to alleviate world hunger, or
   decrease, prompting famine in some regions?
<P>
These questions must be answered before the consequences of global
warming -- assuming there is such a thing -- can be predicted. In any
event, the evidence suggests strongly that: (See Shanahan, "A Guide to
the Global Warming Theory.")
<P>
<LI> Widespread flooding from the melting of the ice caps will not occur.
<LI> Daytime temperatures will not increase.
<LI>Agricultural production will increase, not fall.
<LI>Increased periods and regions of drought will not result.
<LI> Plants will retain water better and thus will be more drought- 
resistant.
<P>
In light of the unanswered questions, new data, and the uncertainties
and inconsistencies of climate change models which are known to mirror
reality inaccurately, the final and most important question is: What
is the appropriate course of action?
<P>

<B> WHAT IS PRUDENT POLICY?</B>
<P>
Administration officials have decided to follow what some bureaucrats
and environmental lobbyists call a "no-regrets" policy. Basically,
this policy works on the "just in case" principle: government should
take decisive, albeit expensive, action if a potentially serious
problem is possible -- just in case. But while this argument may sound
plausible, it ignores the dangers of overreaction. Hundreds of
thousands of Americans could lose their jobs as the Administration
combats what may well be an entirely mythical problem. 
<P>
     When faced with uncertain science like the theory of global
warming, what should the government do? One of four basic strategies
can be adopted, depending on the particular situation. (S. Fred
Singer, "Environmental Strategies with Uncertain Science," Regulation,
Winter 1990, p. 65.) 
<P>
OPTION #1: Take no action, not even research. This option is, of
   course, costless, but it introduces the danger both of not dealing
   with a potential problem and of not learning the degree of a
   possible threat.
<P>
OPTION #2: Conduct more research, but take no other action. This
   option is relatively inexpensive, yet increases knowledge of the
   scope and likelihood of a potential problem. It risks the possible
   consequences associated with deferring action and having to catch
   up later; but if stepped-up research shows the problem to have been
   overrated, or nonexistent, huge and unnecessary costs will have
   been avoided.
<P>
OPTION #3: Take limited action to control greenhouse emissions, phased
   in over a period. This option is also less expensive than tackling
   the problem -- again, assuming it exists -- completely and
   immediately; but it is extremely expensive when compared with
   research, and the result may be huge expenditures on a problem that
   does not exist.
<P>
OPTION #4: Undertake full control of emissions on an emergency
   timetable. This option addresses the potential harm as quickly and
   thoroughly as possible, but it also means a heavy cost to the
   economy for what may be a nonexistent problem.
  <P>
If real, the threat posed by global warming is large enough to rule
out the first option as sound policy. Likewise, the cost to Americans
of an emergency program to avert an improbable catastrophe is heavy
enough to rule out the fourth option.
<P>
     The decision as to whether the U.S. should "take action" or
increase research should be based on the potential cost of delaying
action while research is conducted compared with the cost of action.
According to a scientific panel of the George C. Marshall Institute, a
Washington, DC.-based public policy institute focusing on scientific
matters, two important studies indicate that the cost of delay is in
fact very small:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The calculations [of both studies] show that a five-year
     delay in limiting carbon emissions will make the world
     warmer in the next century by at most one tenth of a degree,
     compared to how warm it will be if there were no delay.
     (George C. Marshall Institute, "Global Warming Update:
     Recent Scientific Findings," 1992.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Meanwhile, knowledge is increasing rapidly because of stepped-up
research. The vast majority of what scientists know about climate
change has been learned in the last three or four years, and this
knowledge is expected to increase substantially more within a few
years.
<P>
     Despite the need for more data, and although the United States is
under no international obligation to leap without looking, the
Administration is pursuing the third option. Indeed, "this [national
action plan] is a political commitment of the president," according to
Dr. Susan Tierney, Assistant Secretary for Policy, Planning, and
Program Evaluation at the Department of Energy. (Speaking before U.S.
Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources hearing on
Administration's National Action Plan to Reduce Greenhouse Gases,
October 28, 1993.) Yet the total costs are unknown. The $63 billion
cost of the Administration's plan almost certainly is an underestimate
-- and it is only the first installment. If the aim is to limit CO2
emissions during the next century, the United States will have to
continue its efforts beyond the year 2000.
<P>
     Given the enormous but unknown costs and the negligible danger
from delay, the focus of U.S. efforts should be to expand scientific
knowledge about global warming, not to spend billions on a program to
minimize the risk of an improbable theory. Specifically, the U.S.
should:
<P>
Continue federal funding for climate change research. 
<P>
     Currently, the U.S. spends more on climate change research than
the rest of the world combined. Yet some environmentalists, as well as
the Office of Technology Assessment, advocate reducing scientific
research on whether global climate change will occur. (Office of
Technology Assessment, Preparing for an Uncertain Climate -- Volume
II, OTA-568, October 1993.) Instead, they want funds to be devoted to
studying the effects of global warming based on the assumption that
because runaway global warming could come suddenly at any time, it is
better to act now on this extreme improbability than to determine
whether it is even possible.
<P>
Open the National Archives to climate change researchers. 
<P>
     Subject to legitimate national security concerns, such as sources
and methods of intelligence gathering and existing programs,
scientific researchers should have access to the National Archives,
which houses mountains of data that could be used to accelerate
research. Collected by surveillance satellites, aircraft, submarines,
and oceanographic vessels, these data could aid in research on past
contours and thaw rates of polar ice caps, ocean chemistry and
temperatures, and scores of other questions.
<P>
These two steps would ensure that scientists could continue to
increase their knowledge of climate interaction at a rapid rate.
Moreover, America would avoid the mistake of spending enormous sums of
money on what science may show to be a non-problem.
<P>

<B> CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
Faced with an uncertain science and the known consequences of rash
action, sound public policy demands that lawmakers use care in
choosing how the United States addresses global warming. If billions
of dollars are squandered on what turns out to be a "Chicken Little"
threat, lawmakers will have failed in their duty.
<P>
     As envisioned, the Clinton Administration's National Action Plan
will impose large costs on all households even though scientists
remain divided as to whether adverse climate changes will occur. The
wisest course of action would be to increase the corpus of knowledge
of the Earth's atmosphere before spending billions on potentially
unnecessary programs.

INTRODUCTION

<P>Congress is considering legislation to reauthorize the Clean
Water Act, passed in 1972 to clean up the nation's rivers, lakes, and
streams. (The forerunner of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act,
as the Clean Water Act also is known, was passed in 1948 as the Water
Pollution Control Act of 1948, Public Law 809-845. The Clean Water
Act's structure is much different, but built upon the 1948
foundation.) One of the key issues being debated is federal wetlands
policy. In practice, the Clean Water Act is being used as a
legislative vehicle to restrict any disturbance of wetlands, even
though wetlands are not mentioned in the legislation.

<P>Wetlands can be defined very loosely as lands that are wet, such
as swamps, and their protection has long been a politically
contentious issue. Although the Administration recently claimed that
its new proposal "broke the gridlock on wetlands policy," ("Highlights
of the Clinton Administration's Environmental Accomplishments,"
released by the White House April 21, 1994.) its claim is far from
accurate; the controversy continues unabated, in large part because of
the confusing and onerous nature of existing wetland policy.
Specifically:

There is great doubt whether the executive branch is authorized to
protect wetlands under the Clean Water Act as currently written.

The official definition of what constitutes a wetland uses a one-size-
fits-all approach, has fluctuated frequently, and has been overly
broad.

Disagreement exists over whether the nation already has achieved its
wetland goal of "no net loss" in light of evidence that in 1994 there
will be a wetlands net gain of nearly 60,000 acres.
<P>
The government consistently has refused to compensate property owners
for the lost value of land when, to preserve wetlands, owners are
denied the right to develop or use their land.

<P>Congress should address these problems in its consideration of
the Clean Water Act and in subsequent legislation. Failure to do so
will mean continued and valid charges of injustice in federal policy,
and the resulting lawsuits will continue to clog the court system.
Equally important, failure will mean that the nation's scarce economic
resources will continue to be misdirected to low-priority
environmental problems. Specifically, Congress should:
<P>
1)   State clearly in the Clean Water Act reauthorization that
     protection is limited to water pollution and that wetlands are
     not protected under the Act.
<P>
2)   Decide whether wetlands should be protected for their own sake.
     If the answer is yes, a separate Wetlands Protection Act should
     be passed that provides clear authority to the executive branch
     to regulate wetlands for their ecological value. This new Act
     should require the executive branch to define different
     categories of wetlands according to their ecological structure
     and value. The categorization should include the economic value
     of land, to ensure that the country obtains the "biggest bang for
     every environmental buck."
<P>
3)   Require a Presidential Report to Congress detailing a county-by-
     county breakdown of the number of acres being converted from
     wetlands to productive use and the number of acres being restored
     to wetland status, highlighting any conflicts in the current
     government wetland data.
<P>
4)   Require the government to pay landowners that are denied the
     right to use their land the fair market value -- plus 15 percent
     -- of the rights taken. This additional premium would compensate
     owners on average for their inconvenience and for the lost
     personal value of their land. Additionally, it would discourage
     highly disruptive government actions that are only marginally
     beneficial. (See footnote 41 for a discussion of why a premium is
     needed.)

 <P>    If these solutions are not enacted, America will continue to
misspend its resources pursuing a misguided policy on wetlands
protection that it is not clearly authorized by law to regulate. And
irate landowners will continue to oppose government wetland policy
because of its fundamentally unfair nature. Wetlands protection should
not be an issue clogging the courts. It needs instead to be addressed
properly and definitively by Congress.
<P>
     
ACTION ON CAPITOL HILL

 <P>    Congress is having difficulty reauthorizing the Clean Water Act
because of the varied and complex issues surrounding the law. In
addition to dealing with the heated wetlands controversy, Congress is
considering how best to control what is known technically as "non-
point source pollution," or pollution that enters waterways from no
specific source, such as from agricultural run-off. These issues have
slowed considerably the progress toward reauthorization. 

<P>     The Senate Clean Water bill reported by the Environment and
Public Works Committee (S. 2093), which is the rewrite of S.1114 and
S. 1304, is co-sponsored by Senators Max Baucus (D-MT), Chairman of
the Environment and Public Works Committee, and John Chafee (R-RI),
ranking Republican on the same committee. (S. 2093 is a substitute
bill that combined the substantive provisions of S. 1114 and S. 1304
as well as other minor bills. Thus, it was reported as an original
bill.) Unfortunately, the bill does little of substance to solve the
major problems with current wetland policy. Significantly, it does
confer legislative authority on the executive branch to regulate
wetlands. But this authority would do far more harm than good unless
the other major problems listed above are addressed as well.

<P>     At this time, the status of the bill's consideration is
uncertain. Although Chairman Baucus has indicated he intends to bring
the bill to the floor as soon as possible, significant opposition may
forestall that step. One indication of this is a bipartisan letter to
Baucus in late April from 46 Senators detailing their extensive
substantive problems with S. 1114 (now incorporated in S. 2093),
including its failure to address key wetland reforms. (Specifically,
the letter states that "S.1114 fails to address needed wetland reform.
Prior converted wetlands should be excluded, regardless of the crop
grown. Agricultural lands cropped a majority of the time should be
excluded from jurisdiction. Classification of wetlands should be
established....We also have concerns with the following issues:...
prior converted wetlands, agricultural lands definition, definitions
for pollutant and discharge.... " Letter to The Honorable Max Baucus
from 46 Senators (bipartisan), April 25, 1994.) Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, however, has indicated he will move forward with the
present bill despite these concerns.

<P>     On the House side, Representative Norman Mineta (D-CA), Chairman
of the Public Works and Transportation Committee, is sponsoring that
chamber's version of reauthorization legislation (H.R.3948). The bill,
introduced on March 3, originally ignored the wetland issue but has
been changed in fundamental ways by Chairman Mineta with little input
from Committee members. Although it now includes a wetland provision
providing legislative authority for regulation, like the Baucus bill
it still lacks the fundamental reforms needed.

 <P>    The House bill has been as controversial as the Senate version
because there were no hearings before mark-up originally was scheduled
for May 3. Chairman Mineta, however, did not have the votes to send
the bill out of committee. Also, Members in May circulated a
"Discussion Draft Bi-partisan Alternative" to H.R. 3948 that would
address many of the problems now existing in Clean Water Act and
wetland policy. Under pressure from his committee members, and because
of the possibility an alternative bill might succeed, Chairman Mineta
consented to hearings just days before the intended May 3 mark-up,
which was postponed until after hearings are concluded.

<P>     An important bill that is substantially incorporated in the
alternative proposal is H.R.1330, sponsored by Representative James
Hayes (D-LA). The Hayes bill would require the Army Corps of Engineers
to classify wetlands according to their ecological value. During
hearings, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner
stated that several of the alternative bill's provisions "would be
detrimental to wetlands protection." (Speaking before the Committee on
Public Works and Transportation's Water Resources and Environment
Subcommittee on May 24, 1994. Technically, the Administrator did not
address herself to the alternative bill, but the specific issues that
she addressed are the core wetlands provisions in the alternative
bill.) Specifically, she opposed plans to categorize and rank
wetlands, change wetlands delineation criteria, and pay owners for
government purchase of high-value wetlands.

<P>     Another important House bill concerning wetlands (H.R.3875) is
sponsored by W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (D-LA), who calls his bill the
"private property owners' Bill of Rights" because it mandates
compensation to landowners when government action to protect wetlands
or endangered species results in a fifty percent reduction in property
value. While this bill is not tied to the Clean Water Act
reauthorization, it has gained widespread support in the policy
community. Opposition to the Tauzin bill also has mounted, making
action doubtful at this time.

<P>
FUNDAMENTALS OF WETLAND POLICY

 <P>    Wetlands, traditionally known as swamps or bogs, have been
disappearing at a rapid rate during this century. The fundamental
reason for their disappearance earlier in the century is also the
reason for efforts to protect them now: wetlands or swamps are unique
ecosystems. Wetlands are valued by many Americans for the very
practical reason that they can act as a buffer against flooding and
can purify streams and rivers, in addition to providing a home for
diverse species of wildlife. Others despise wetlands as "mosquito-
infested swamps," and indeed they typically are breeding grounds for
disease-carrying mosquitoes. Historically, the vast majority of
Americans have fallen into the latter group and have supported efforts
to eradicate wetlands, but increased public recognition of the
positive qualities of some wetlands in recent decades has led to
demands for preservation.

<P>     Ironically, the organization in the United States most
responsible for destroying these swamps is now the primary
organization charged with their protection -- the Army Corps of
Engineers. In 1780, before the Corps' systematic campaign to fill in
wetlands, there were 221 million acres of wetlands in the lower
continental United States. Today only an estimated 104 million acres
are left. ("Wetlands Losses in the United States 1780's to 1980's,"
U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1990.)
The Corps has taken on the mission of wetland protection as one of its
primary activities and, in conjunction with the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), zealously punishes violators of its
complicated regulations. For example, Bill Ellen, an environmental
engineer and consultant, inadvertently violated federal wetlands
regulations in 1988 by making duck ponds on his employer's privately
owned wildlife preserve. He paid for this error by being jailed as a
felon four years later. His case is not unique.

 <P>    Under federal regulations as now written, a landowner intending
to build on, clear, or otherwise disturb wetlands must obtain
permission from the EPA and the Corps through a permit application
process. (Sections 301 and 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act, as amended.) If the permit is denied or carries conditions, the
landowner cannot use his property as he intended. Thus, for example,
if an application for a permit to alter a wetland in order to
construct a duck pond or building were denied, the landowner would be
an owner in name only. (The owner would have title to the land, and
would pay taxes on land, but would not in practice be able to use the
land. The landowner, however, still would retain the right to exclude
others from his property. While this retained right can have value if
the land is close to a home or for a similar reason, in the absence of
the right to beneficial use, this right to exclude is frequently
worthless. Counties increasingly are taking this decreased value into
account in terms of property taxes. In Anchorage, Alaska, for example,
the value of an acre of non-usable wetlands is deemed to be $100. This
has the effect of reducing local taxes significantly. Yet, while it
relieves the burden of the owner from paying high taxes on worthless
property, the productive value of the property is lost. Thus, the
local economy loses both economic value and tax revenues.)

<P>     Since the inception of wetland protection, many fundamental
problems and issues have arisen which have caused a growing backlash
against the EPA and the Corps, as well as against environmentalists.
(The backlash against environmentalists has occurred because they are
perceived correctly as driving the government's increasingly strict
wetlands policy. Moreover, they have lobbied actively against payments
to landowners when their land is taken on the premise that it would
cost too much. But there is a cost either way to taking the land; the
only question is who pays the cost.) Traditionally, environmental laws
regulate bigger firms by mandating that they use certain
"environmentally friendly" technologies or meet specific standards
when conducting large-scale operations. The Clean Water Act, for the
most part, uses this same regulatory structure designed for big
business, but under recent wetland policy, the Act's structure also
applies to smaller landowners.

<P>The Clean Water Act has been enlarged through statutory
interpretation to authorize the federal government to regulate anyone
who wishes to use his land if that land is found to meet the
government's definition of a wetland. Thus, homeowners, small
entrepreneurs and developers, and retirees hoping to build their dream
homes all have come under the direct authority of EPA and the Corps.
Essentially, ordinary Americans have been forced to deal with legal
requirements designed for businesses with lawyers on staff or
retainer. But what is an irritation for a large firm can be a costly
legal nightmare for a small landowner, and many of those complying
with requirements lose valuable rights when the federal government
denies them permission to alter their own land. Faced with heavy
mortgage notes on now nearly worthless land, many of those affected
have joined in a growing grass-roots movement to combat what they view
as heavy-handed and legally unauthorized federal actions. (In many of
these cases, the owners cannot simply abandon the mortgage note
because the land affected is generally only a portion of the whole
property. Thus, the regulated owner may own a home on the same site
that also acts as security on the note. Even when the note could be
abandoned, this merely transfers the economic loss to another
individual or firm.) 

<P>In any serious discussion of wetland policy, four issues are of
paramount importance.
<P>
ISSUE #1:  The "Law" That Is Not A Law

<P>The first issue is the apparent lack of legislative authority
under existing law for current executive branch policy on wetlands
protection. The Clean Water Act does not protect explicitly any
wetland; in fact, neither the word "wetland" nor any synonym is
mentioned or implied in the language of the Clean Water Act. Thus, on
its face, the Act authorizes no federal protection of wetlands.
Section 404, the center of the controversy, prohibits the "discharge
of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters" of the United
States unless a permit for such activity is issued. (33 U.S.C.A. sec.
1344; Permits for dredged or fill material, FWPCA sec. 404.) According
to the wording of this clause, Congress clearly intended to limit the
ability of individuals to choke waterways that were navigable by
limiting the practice of dumping dirt into them. By requiring
governmental permission, Congress ensured that navigation remained
clear for boat traffic.

<P>The clause, however, has been broadly interpreted by the Army
Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other
agencies to prohibit virtually any activity in connection with land
that has a certain minimum water content -- whether or not it is
navigable. The ostensible justification for this position is that any
form of pollutant, including clean fill dirt, that comes into contact
with wet soil will make its way via ground water flows into navigable
waterways. While minute quantities can make their way into navigable
waterways, this rationale has been stretched so far that the
government now considers any mechanical disturbance, such as
bulldozing of soil already naturally in the wetland, to be a violation
of the Clean Water Act. But Congress never intended to prevent such
minor movements of soil. Indeed, the legislative history of the
original Act shows that not a single Congressman voiced support for
the strained interpretation the executive branch now reads into it.
Not a single lawmaker even uttered the word "wetland."

<P>Nevertheless, it is arguable that certain kinds of wetland are
protected under the Clean Water Act. (For an in depth and thorough
treatise on the question of wetland protection authority, see William
G. Laffer III, "The Meaning and Scope of the Clean Water Act, and
Especially Section 404, As Applied To Wetlands," February 14, 1992
(revising original dated January 21, 1991. Comments filed with EPA
pursuant to 56 Fed. Reg. 40446.)) The legislative history may provide
some rationale for supporters of current protection in its discussion
of "navigable waters," a term used to specify the type of waterways
the overall Clean Water Act was meant to regulate. ( Courts often rely
on formal comments by Congressmen during the legislative process to
assist them in their determination of the meaning of specific
provisions of laws. The effort is based on the presumption that the
legislative record provides evidence of what meanings were intended by
Congress as a whole when it passed the law. A major problem with
reliance on legislative history, however, is that comments in the
record virtually never reflect the views of all those who vote on the
issue. Hence, the record may inaccurately reflect and even contradict
congressional understanding. The legislative record is useful,
however, to demonstrate that the common understanding of clear and
plain language was not contradicted during debate. See William N.
Eskridge, Jr. and Philip P. Frickey, Legislation: Statutes and the
Creation of Public Policy, American Casebook Series (St. Paul,
Minn.:West Publishing Co., 1988).) In presenting the Conference
version of the Clean Water bill to the House, Representative John
Dingell (D-MI), who was a member of the Conference Committee,
explained that:
<UL>
     the conference bill defines the term "navigable waters"
     broadly for water quality purposes.... Thus, this new
     definition clearly encompasses all water bodies, including
     main streams and their tributaries, for water quality
     purposes.... No longer are the old, narrow definitions...
     going to govern. (1 Legislative History 250 (House
     Consideration of S. Conf. Rep. No. 1236, 92d Cong., 2d
     Sess.) (Oct. 4, 1972) (emphasis added).)</UL>

<P>While this statement and others in the record indicate that
navigability should be construed broadly, this extension of the term
still was meant to apply only to waters that drain or flow into
navigable waters. The legislative history shows the focus of the
definition was to widen the requirement that directly affected waters
be those navigable by vessels. More precisely, the term was broadened
specifically to prevent the migration of pollutants to navigable
waterways from tributaries. ("Water moves[,]... and it is [therefore]
essential that discharge of pollutants be controlled at the source.
Therefore, reference to the control requirements [of the Act] must be
made to the navigable waters, portions thereof, and their tributaries.
S. Rep. No. 414, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 77 (1971), reprinted in 2
Legislative History 1945.)

<P>Although it is possible to stretch that meaning to encompass some
wetlands, not all wetlands can contribute pollutants to navigable
waters. Most crucially, isolated wetlands which do not interact with
waters flowing into navigable waterways (technically known as "non-
adjacent wetlands") cannot by any stretch of interpretation fall under
the Act because there is no possibility a pollutant can enter a
waterway. (The factors that would have to be present for a wetland to
be legitimately covered under the Clean Water Act are, at a minimum:
1) a discharged material; 2) through drainage or flow via either
ground water or surface water; 3) could migrate to an interstate
water. Even this interpretation of the extent of authority is likely
overreaching and broad since section 404 refers specifically to dredge
and fill material.) Indeed, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in
May 1994 held that pollutants are not covered under the Act even if
they can migrate to navigable waters via ground water. The court
indicated that pollutants were covered only if they could migrate via
surface waters to navigable waterways. (Oconomowoc Lake v. Dayton
Hudson Corp., Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 93-3380, May 18,
1994.)

<P>In short, the Act was intended to reduce pollution at its source,
not to protect wetlands per se. (See Laffer, "Meaning and Scope," op.
cit. A final important argument is that Congress does not have the
authority to regulate intrastate wetlands that have no intercourse
with interstate waters because these rights are reserved to the
states. The Supreme Court, however, routinely grants such authority
under the Commerce clause. U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8,
clause 3. While the judicial reasoning behind the Court's
interpretation of the Commerce clause is fatally flawed, it
nevertheless remains the law of the land. See Wickard v. Filburn, 317
U.S. 111, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942).) If an activity would not
produce pollution downstream in a truly navigable water by fostering
migration of pollutants through surface water tributaries, it should
not fall under the authority of the law as written.

<P>Despite their highly questionable authority to regulate wetlands,
the Corps and the EPA have issued regulations restricting any wetland
interference without permission, which averages over a year to obtain
and often is not granted. Despite numerous court challenges,
enforcement of these regulations largely has been supported by the
courts. But this support has not been uniform. (See Oconomowoc, op.
cit.) Moreover, since the Supreme Court has yet to address the issue
squarely, the issue remains unsettled, which merely fuels further
litigation. (The Supreme Court did decide, in a case dealing with
adjacent wetlands, that the term navigable did not require the water
actually be navigable, but rather only that, from water, a pollutant
could flow into navigable waters. United States v. Riverside Bayview
Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121 (1985). This is consistent with the
discussion preceding the accompanying text.)
Recommendation: Given the executive branch's murky authority to
protect wetlands under the Clean Water Act, Congress should decide
legislatively whether wetlands as such should be protected.
In either case, Congress should add a provision during reauthorization
specifically limiting Section 404 to its original purpose of
regulating dredge and fill material, and not protecting wetlands for
their own sake. If Congress also wants to protect wetlands for their
own sake, it should enact separate legislation that consolidates all
wetlands policy and legislation. Thus all enforcement, mitigation, and
restoration programs intended to promote wetlands should be made part
of a "Wetlands Policy Act." Such a new law also should contain relief
measures for landowners once the Bush-Clinton goal of no-net-loss is
achieved (see below).
<P>
ISSUE #2: The Problem Of Definition

<P>The second issue is simply one of definition: what exactly is a
"wetland"? Although this would appear to be a relatively simple
matter, it has proven much more difficult for experts to define than
most people would imagine. Hence the ridicule when former Vice
President Dan Quayle questioned "how wet" land had to be under the
Act. Quayle understood this complicated environmental issue while his
detractors did not. The problem of defining what is a wetland was
characterized succinctly by Robert Pierce of the Army Corps of
Engineers in the National Wetlands Newsletter:
<UL>
     Ecologically speaking, the term "wetland" has no meaning:
     natural systems exist on a hydrolic gradient from ocean to
     desert. Somewhere in the middle are what society calls
     wetlands. For regulatory purposes, a wetland is whatever we
     decide it is. The type of natural systems that have been
     defined as wetlands has changed virtually every year for the
     last decade. (CEI Update (Competitive Enterprise
     Institute),Vol. 7, No. 4, citing Robert J. Pierce,
     "Redefining Our Regulatory Goals," National Wetlands
     Newsletter, November/December 1991, p. 12.)</UL>

<P>Not only has the definition of what is or is not a wetland
changed over time, but the definitions often have been overly broad.
As Senator David Pryor (D-AR) stated last year, "one definition would
designate the entire eastern half of Arkansas to be a wetland and any
activity -- be it for commercial, agricultural, or other purposes --
could be considered breaking the law." ("Wetlands Caucus Created in
Senate," EPA WATCH, August 31, 1993, p. 3.)

<P>Such disagreements as to what constitutes wetlands and how
broadly they should be defined have caused the government to change
its official definition twice since former President Bush made his "no
net loss of wetlands" pledge during the 1988 presidential campaign.
(Bill Peterson, "Bush Vows to Fight Pollution, Install 'Conservation
Ethic'; Speech Distances Candidate From Reagan," The Washington Post,
September 1, 1988, p. A1.) At that time, the 1987 Wetlands Delineation
Manual specified the official definition of a wetland. (Federal Manual
for Identifying and Delineating Jurisdictional Wetlands (1987).)

<P>Fundamental changes in this standard were made in 1989, however,
when President Bush's new appointees decided to broaden the definition
of a wetland. This new definition was severely criticized as
overreaching any reasonable definition of land that is wet. By some
estimates, 40 percent of drought-stricken California (even before the
winter rains of 1992-1993) would have qualified as wetlands under the
1989 standard. (Rick Henderson, "The Swamp Thing," Reason, April 1991.
pp. 32-33.) The 1989 Delineation Manual stayed in effect until 1992,
when an appropriations amendment sponsored by Senator Bennett Johnston
(D-LA) limited funding to enforcement of the 1987 standard. In effect,
the 1989 standard was put on the shelf. Although the definition issue
was re-evaluated yet again by the Clinton Administration, the White
House decided to let the 1987 definition stand temporarily.

<P>     Basically, three factors are considered when determining whether
an area is a wetland under the 1987, 1989, and other definitions:
<P>
1)   The number of days land is inundated or saturated with water;
<P>
2)   Whether the area has hydric soil, or "earth that is chemically
     changed by water, usually with a peat, muck, or mineral base;"
     (Richard Miniter, "Muddy Waters: The Quagmire of Wetlands
     Regulation," Policy Review, Spring 1991, p. 72.) and 
<P>
3)   Whether the area has one of approximately 7,000 "indicator"
     species of plants growing on it.

<P>     Most of the problems in defining a wetland have arisen not from
disagreements over the appropriate factors, but over how many factors
must exist and to what degree. For instance, should two or all three
factors exist for a given site to be classified as a wetland? How many
days should it be saturated with water and to what depth? 

<P>Much of the problem with both the 1987 and 1989 Delineation
Manuals has centered on the "one-size-fits-all" approach to wetlands
designation. Ecological systems by nature are typically varied in
their structure, sensitivity, and ecological and economic value. These
considerations, currently neglected in forming decisions, (There is
some limited flexibility in the 1987 Wetlands Delineation Manual, but
this flexibility cuts both ways; an EPA regional office has the
flexibility to ignore mitigating factors in its decision making
process.) should be given utmost attention whenever a determination is
made as to whether a particular site should be declared a wetland and
preserved or declared a "dry" land with no restrictions against
development (or even declared a wetland that should be developed
anyway because the economic value in a specific situation far
outweighs its limited ecological value).
<P>
Recommendation: If Congress wants to extend protection to wetlands
   legislatively, the Wetlands Protection Act should require the Army
   Corps of Engineers to classify lands according to their ecological
   value.

<P>Wetlands would be divided into classes, such as "A," "B," "C,"
etc. Government would be authorized to acquire only those with the
highest ecological value (class "A"), which would merit the highest
degree of protection. Lower categories or classes could be given
lesser degrees of protection. (Congressman James Hayes' bill,
H.R.1330, would put just such a system into place by dividing wetlands
into three categories and requiring payment to affected landowners in
Class "A" wetlands.) This would avoid the inherent waste of spending
scarce economic resources on relatively unimportant low-value wetlands
and enable the country to target its efforts toward protection of more
valuable ecosystems. Moreover, since the government would be obligated
to purchase only the highest-valued wetland property, its intrusion
into the personal affairs of middle-class Americans would be kept to a
minimum.
<P>
ISSUE #3: Wetland Gains and Losses

<P>The third issue centers on whether wetland protection legislation
is necessary at all. (For a more detailed, but concise treatment of
this topic, see Jonathan Tolman, "Gaining Ground: Analysis of Wetland
Trends in the United States," Washington, D.C.,Competitive Enterprise
Institute, May 1994.) Despite the statement last year by EPA
Administrator Carol Browner that nearly 300,000 acres of wetland are
lost annually, 300,000 acres are not being lost. (Ibid., citing USA
Today, August 25, 1993.) Her estimates are based on figures over a
decade old. (This figure reflects the annual loss rate of 290,000
estimated for the 1974-1983 period, see T.E. Dahl and C.E. Johnson,
Status and Trends of Wetlands in the Coterminous United States,
Mid-1970's to Mid-1980's, U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and
Wildlife Service, Washington, D.C., 1991.) More recent data suggest a
much different picture. Based on government figures, a recent study by
Jonathan Tolman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that
America will have 59,000 more acres of wetlands at the end of 1994
than it did at the beginning. (Tolman, op. cit.)

<P>Tolman's estimate does not imply that wetlands no longer are
converted to productive use such as agriculture or development
(although the loss rate has slowed), but rather that wetland
restoration has increased significantly. The most recent data
available on wetland conversion rates were compiled by the Department
of Agriculture's Soil Conservation Service as part of its National
Resources Inventory, which is updated every five years. (U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, 1991 Update of
National Resources Inventory, Wetlands Data For Non-Federal Rural
Lands, Iowa State University Statistical Laboratory.) Unfortunately,
the Administration and groups calling for preservation of wetlands
have not made a point of publicizing the results, perhaps because the
results do not support their cause: the data show that wetland
conversion is slowing. From 1982-1987, the annual loss rate was
131,000 acres, significantly less than estimated by the Department of
Interior for the previous decade. Moreover, the loss rate slowed even
more from 1987-1991, when only 108,000 acres were lost annually.

<P>The rate of increase in wetland restoration, on the other hand,
has been dramatic in recent years, not because of the Clean Water
Act's prohibitions, but because of incentives to private landowners
under three other programs: the Partners for Wildlife program, the
Conservation Reserve Program, and the Wetlands Reserve Program. These
three programs, which are designed to encourage landowners to create
new wetlands, are responsible for the restoration of over 560,000
acres over the last seven years, and the annual rate has been
increasing. Based on annual trends and restoration authorizations,
Tolman estimates that in 1994 a total of 167,000 acres will be
restored -- compared with only 108,000 acres lost -- for a net gain of
59,000 acres of wetland. (Tolman, op. cit. The study contains good
charts illustrating this trend line, as well as more information on
the particulars of the wetlands restoration programs. Note that the
108,000 acres converted figure is probably conservative since the
trend, at least for agricultural conversions, has been downward. Thus,
the net gain figure is likely understated.)
Recommendation: Congress should require a presidential report
outlining all known information on wetland conversion and restoration.
This report should present a breakdown of conversions and restorations
on a county-by-county, state-by-state basis. Contradictory government
data should be highlighted and relevant considerations discussed.
Whenever discrepancies in the data exist, the report should show the
range of conversion and restoration estimates based on all data. The
report should be updated yearly. Moreover, if a "Wetlands Protection
Act" is considered necessary, Congress should incorporate a provision
giving relief to landowners from denial of permits to use their land
if in any consecutive two years there is a net gain of wetland acres.
Landowners, after all, should not be denied the fruits of their labor
if their actions will not result in a reduction of the "wetland
stock."
<P>
ISSUE #4: Whose Property Is It, Anyway?

<P>The fourth issue concerns the de facto taking of property through
regulation, known popularly as "regulatory takings," that now occurs
under regulation of wetlands and other property. (For in depth
research and clear analysis of constitutional issues surrounding
regulatory takings, see the book by Mark Pollot, Grand Theft and Petit
Larceny: Property Rights in America (San Francisco: Pacific Research
Institute, 1993). Pollot also authored Executive Order 12630, signed
during the Reagan Administration, that requires agencies to do a
Takings Impact Analysis (TIA); essentially, the agencies are required
to consider the potential that their actions will result in a taking
of property requiring just compensation and, where alternatives to
achieve the statutory goal exist, to adopt the alternative least
intrusive to the landowner.) One of the most unfair and burdensome
hardships inflicted by regulatory takings is that wetland owners are
not reimbursed for their loss. For instance, if an elderly couple
spends a large portion of their retirement savings to buy property to
build their dream home and that property is subsequently designated a
wetland, the value of their property -- and their savings -- is gone.
Unfortunately, tales of financial hardship caused by government
designation of lands as wetlands have become commonplace.

<P>The Administration is on record as opposing payments to
landowners whose property is designated a wetland. Office of
Management and Budget Director Leon Panetta says it would be "an
unnecessary and unwise use of taxpayer dollars" and a drain on the
federal budget. (Speaking at a hearing before the Committee on Public
Works and Transportation's Subcommittee on Water Resources and
Environment, U.S. House of Representatives, May 26, 1994.) Landowners
counter that regulatory takings are a drain on the family budget.
(Often ignored in the debate is that many families have mortgages on
the regulated land. While the regulated portions of their land may
become almost worthless, these families must continue to make large
mortgage payments or lose their homes situated on unregulated land
financed by the same mortgage.) Wetlands regulation has evolved into a
question of whether constitutionally guaranteed property rights are
being infringed; and since the courts have been of limited help,
landowners are in need of legislative protection.

<P>To understand why legislative protection for landowners is
appropriate, it is necessary to understand the broader issue of
governmental taking of property. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution implicitly recognizes that the federal government may
take private property for public use. This power, known as eminent
domain, was recognized by the Supreme Court as early as 1795 in
Vanhorne's Lessee v. Dorrance when the court found that "the despotic
power, as it has been aptly called by some writers, of taking private
property, when state necessity requires it, exists in every
government... government could not subsist without it." (2 U.S. (2
Dall.) 304, 311 (1795).)

<P>The Fifth Amendment explicitly mandates, however, that government
must pay the property owner for the land confiscated. This concept,
embodied in the clause "nor shall private property be taken for public
use, without just compensation," ensures that property taken for
public use is paid for by those who benefit -- the public -- and not
by the citizen unfortunate enough to own land the government wants.
(Constitution of the United States, Amendment V, clause 3) In its most
basic sense, this is a fairness issue: Why should one American bear
the entire burden of the government's pursuit of a national good?

<P>The Founders well understood the positive economic consequences
of protecting owners' investments in their property. If property is to
be put to its best and most highly valued use, ownership must reside
in the hands of those who value it for as much or more than the fair
market value. (By definition, owners personally value their property
more highly than the government even when just compensation is paid
for an involuntary taking of land, or else the owner would have sold
it voluntarily. This "idiosyncratic" or subjective value by the owner
is real, but is a premium above the amount that could be obtained in a
fair market transaction. Due to this generally small discrepancy, even
when the government pays fair market value, it is purchasing the
property in a sense at a bargain price because the payment is less
than the value of the property to the seller. Nevertheless, since the
subjective value cannot be measured accurately, the objective standard
of fair market value properly should be paid as just compensation by
the government, with perhaps a fixed percentage of additional
compensation to offset the damage to the owner forcibly separated from
control of his land. A fair percentage would be perhaps 15 percent. Of
course, under this additional compensation arrangement, there would be
"winners" and "losers" in the sense that the 15 percent premium would
be more or less than the owner's subjective value compared with the
market price. But on average landowners would be more fairly
compensated and the government would be discouraged from taking
disruptive actions that are only marginally beneficial to the public.)
If government had a free hand to take property without payment, its
incentive to confiscate property that conferred only a small benefit
on the public would be large; after all, even small benefits outweigh
a zero cost. The problem is that costs are nonexistent only to the
government. The actual costs, borne by someone else, often are
substantial.

<P>Another positive result of requiring just compensation is
increased security. The Founders well understood that protection of
property restrained usurpation of other rights recognized by the
Constitution. It is this relationship to which Supreme Court Justice
Potter Stewart referred in Lynch v. Household Finance Co. Inc. when he
stated that there is a "fundamental interdependence... between the
personal right to liberty and the personal right to property." (405
U.S. 538, 552 (1972).)

<P>Practically speaking, governments can control a wide spectrum of
individual activities if they can control whether individuals remain
financially secure or must surrender their property. The majority
truly can tyrannize a disfavored minority if property rights are
uncertain. As James Madison characterized the problem of individual
rights in Federalist Paper No. 10, "it is that [pure] democracies have
ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been
incompatible with personal security or the rights of property." It was
to restrict just such tyranny over individuals that the Framers put
severe limits, such as the requirement of just compensation, on the
unchecked will of the majority. 

<P>The Supreme Court has been clear in requiring federal, state, and
local governments to pay just compensation whenever governmental
bodies physically take or occupy land or real estate. (The requirement
of just compensation by the federal government under the 5th Amendment
is extended to the states under the 14th Amendment. It also applies,
by further extension, to localities since their authority is derived
from the state.) Essentially, the Court has held that, even if only a
small amount of real property is involved, a taking has occurred and
just compensation is required. (Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV
Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982).) Unfortunately, however, the Court's
decisions regarding regulatory takings have been less clear and
consistent. One landmark case essentially found that if any
compensation was provided, whether at a just level or not, a taking
had not occurred. (Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City,
438 U.S. 104 (1978). This was one of many holdings in the case.) This
reasoning was faulty because the question of whether a property right
has been taken is independent of the issue of compensation, which by
definition can take place only if property has been taken or lost. If
a small payment negates the finding of a taking, it also would negate
the requirement of "just" compensation. (This is clearly absurd on its
face. Such a construction completely negates the effect of the just
compensation clause and, instead, substitutes the requirement of a
token payment.)

<P>The Supreme Court in recent years has begun slowly to move back
toward protection of property owners. (See First English Evangelical
Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, California, 482
U.S. 304, 96 L.Ed. 2d 250 (1987) (finding a temporary restriction on
property to be a taking) and Nollan v. California Coastal Commission,
107 S.Ct. 3141, 488 U.S. 825, 97 L. Ed. 2d 677 (finding that the
government could not engage in "extortion" by requiring a homeowner to
provide public access to the beach in order to get a permit to build a
second story on his bungalow. The Court found that there was an
insufficient nexus between the Coastal Commission's mission of
protecting the coastal view and providing public access to the
beach).) In its most recent regulatory taking case, Lucas v. South
Carolina Coastal Council, (Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council,
505 U.S. ____, 120 L. Ed. 2d 798, 112 S.Ct. 2886 (1992).) the Court in
1992 found that a regulation prohibiting property use which also
destroyed 100 percent of the property's value was a taking requiring
just compensation. The Court, however, specifically declined to
address the issue of whether anything less than a complete devaluation
was a taking. (Essentially, the Court makes the same mistake here as
it did in Penn Central in defining a property right as being its
value. Simply put, property rights are fixed legal rights of an
individual to use and enjoy property. Since property can be used in
many different ways, there are consequently many different rights the
individual owns. For instance, an owner of land can sell an easement
to a neighbor allowing the neighbor to walk across the land, yet
retain all other rights to that land himself. By focusing on the value
of the rights infringed rather than on the substance of the rights
denied to an owner, the court confuses fixed legal rights with the
ever fluctuating fair market value of those rights. The value of the
rights taken certainly is important in determining the level of
compensation that is just, but it is irrelevant in determining whether
a legal right has been taken in the first place. The Supreme Court
heard its most recent property rights case, Dolan v. Tigard, on March
23, 1994. The case centered on whether the City of Tigard could
condition the issuance of a permit for store expansion on Dolan's
relinquishing of title to land; for a greenway and a bicycle path to
be constructed at Dolan's expense. The decision is expected this
summer.) Thus, it is uncertain whether the government must compensate
owners when the property retains, say, 20 percent of its previous fair
market value.
<P>
Recommendation: In light of the ambiguous and limited protection
   against uncompensated regulatory takings, a Private Property
   Protection Act is necessary to ensure private property rights are
   fully protected.

<P>If the government infringes any property right by denying an
owner use of his own land, the affected landowner should be given the
full fair market value of any reduction in the value of his property.
While any devaluation should be compensated, the Act should specify
that a 25 percent devaluation of real property after an infringing
governmental action is a presumptive taking requiring full
compensation for the value of the land taken. (The Act should include
a section that a taking has not occurred if the governmental action is
to abate a nuisance as defined by background principles of common law
within the state the property is situated.) The owner also should be
allowed to elect payment for the entire value of the regulated land --
rather than just the reduction in value -- if he forfeits title to the
government. (It is important to note that this provision should apply
only to land directly affected by the governmental action, including
permit denial, and would not allow the property owner to demand
payment for the value of acreage not affected by the regulatory
action. If the owner does not elect to forfeit his title, the
government should pay only the differential between the fair market
value prior to and after the regulatory taking since no additional
rights have been condemned and compensated.)  These provisions will
constrain judicial latitude and thus minimize the possibility of
misguided judicial interpretation limiting protection to property
owners.

<P>Moreover, a 15 percent premium over fair market value should be
paid. This premium roughly would compensate owners for their
inconvenience and for the lost personal value of their land. (See note
41 for a discussion of why a premium is needed.) It also would reduce
highly disruptive actions that are only marginally beneficial to the
government.


CONCLUSION

Unfortunately, the wetland policy that has emerged in recent years is
fraught with problems that have contributed to a growing backlash from
property owners. While the issues are many and varied, four basic
problems have fueled the controversy. First, clear legislative
authority to protect wetlands as wetlands is lacking in law. Second, a
one-size-fits-all definition of what constitutes a wetland is used but
is crude and inappropriate. Third, new evidence has shown that America
has met its no-net-loss of wetlands goal and more wetland acres are
being restored than lost. Fourth, landowners whose valuable property
rights are infringed to pursue this public benefit are not compensated
for their loss.

<P>Each of these problems can be solved. For example, the lack of
legislative authority to protect "wetlands as wetlands" can be dealt
with by clarifying that Section 404 of the Clean Water Act is not
intended to protect wetlands. If protection of "wetlands as wetlands"
is desired, a Wetlands Protection Act should be passed to encompass
all federal efforts to maintain the current number of wetlands,
including restoration of wetlands as well as efforts to slow wetland
losses. This Act also should require the Army Corps of Engineers to
classify wetlands according to their ecological value so that the
nation's economic resources are not squandered on land that is of
little ecological significance. Moreover, it may be unnecessary to
limit the private development of wetlands at all in light of new
evidence that the nation likely will gain almost 60,000 net acres of
wetlands due to increased restoration. Congress can answer the charges
of unfairness by landowners who have seen their life savings destroyed
by onerous wetlands regulations simply by requiring the government to
pay for the value of the land it takes.

<P>Although the Clean Water Act never was designed as a vehicle to
protect wetlands, it has evolved into a regulatory nightmare for
ordinary Americans who simply want to use their land as they intended
when they took out a mortgage on their property. If Americans still
believe in the basic concepts upon which this nation was built --
liberty, opportunity, and the right to reap the rewards of hard effort
-- they must reverse the current wetland policy of essentially
confiscating land from the nation's most productive and valuable
citizens.

INTRODUCTION<P>
      George Bush signed the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) last December 17.  If approved by Congress, this trade pact
will link the United States, Mexico, and Canada into the world's
largest free trade zone.  Bill Clinton has expressed support for the
agreement, but he faces considerable opposition in the Congress,
primarily from his own Democratic Party.  NAFTA will face an up-or-
down vote in the Congress, probably this fall, but certainly no later
than the end of this year.
<P>
      Passage of the NAFTA will be a significant foreign policy test
of the Clinton Administration.  Senator Bill Bradley, the Democrat
from New Jersey, noted last February that the pact will be "the most
important foreign policy decision that Clinton will make in his first
six months in office."  There is more at stake, however, than simply
enhanced trade with Mexico.  The NAFTA will be an important factor in
ensuring that U.S.  businesses remain internationally competitive and
that free trade continues to advance around the world. 
<P>
      Despite the agreement's acknowledged benefits to the U.S. 
economy, many groups oppose free trade in general, and freer trade
with Mexico in particular.  Among these are several labor unions,
environmental organizations, and some industries which favor
protectionism.  Believing that their interests will be harmed by freer
trade with Mexico, these groups try to portray the NAFTA as harmful to
the U.S.  economy as a whole.  They allege that the NAFTA will
increase pollution of the environment, reduce worker safety and wages
in both the U.S.  and Mexico, and cause the loss of U.S.  jobs.
<P>
      In response to these and other criticisms, Clinton has made U.S. 
approval of the NAFTA conditional on the negotiation of additional
"parallel accords" concerning labor and the environment.  Far from
being low-cost remedies to these concerns, however, these agreements
have the potential to undo much of the good created by NAFTA. 
Opponents of free trade have seized upon these parallel agreements as
vehicles by which to reintroduce the trade restrictions NAFTA is
intended to eliminate.
<P>
      The strategy of anti-NAFTA groups is to make increased trade
with Mexico appear to the American public as threatening.  Because
Americans are unlikely to be swayed by appeals for protecting such
special interests as labor unions, environmental groups, and
uncompetitive industries, opponents of NAFTA's free trade provisions
have targeted labor and environmental issues in a campaign to broaden
the appeal of their cause.
<P>
      In their attempts to discredit the NAFTA, trade protectionists
exaggerate the potential harm of the accord while rejecting many of
its benefits.  The disintegration and distortions advanced by these
groups have clouded the NAFTA debate in Congress.  As Congress begins
its consideration of the agreement in the coming months, it will
require clear and concise information on the results of approving the
NAFTA.  Only then can it put aside the pleas for protection by special
interest groups and ideological opponents of free trade and decide
whether NAFTA benefits the country as a whole.
<P>

A PRIMER ON NAFTA:  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
<P>
      Opposition to the NAFTA focuses on its alleged negative effects
on jobs and the environment.  Labor unions worry that freer trade with
Mexico will cause the loss of jobs among their members, and lead to
relaxed worker safety laws.  Environmentalists maintain that
commercial integration between the two countries will lower U.S. 
environmental standards, prompt polluting U.S.  companies to move to
Mexico to avoid strict standards, and lead to massive pollution in
Mexico.  In addition, opponents charge that the agreement was
negotiated in secret, without input from labor, business, and
environmental groups.
<P>

THE NAFTA, JOBS, AND THE ECONOMY
<P>
      Among the most commonly expressed questions raised about the
NAFTA and its impact on North America are: 
<P>
Q:    With Mexico so much poorer than the U.S., will expanded trade
      with that country reduce the standard of living of Americans?
<P>
      The reduction of trade barriers around the world since the end
of World War II has brought about enormous increases in trade and
economic activity among the participating countries.  In constructing
this international trading system at the 1948 Bretton Woods
Conference, Democrats and Republicans understood that free trade would
benefit most working Americans.
<P>
      Despite the clear connection between free trade and general
economic prosperity, there will always be groups who believe their
individual interests to be threatened by competition from abroad.  The
traditional free trade opponents were those industries such as
shipping and textiles that profited from government subsidies and
tariffs that protected them against foreign competition.  In addition
to these protected, uncompetitive industries, the opponents of free
trade now include labor unions and organizations whose self-interest
makes them hostile to free trade and market economics in general and
whose message is that, contrary to all evidence, free trade will lead
to a reduction in living standards.
<P>
      These critics are wrong.  The NAFTA will benefit the whole U.S. 
economy.  It will lower costs for consumers on such basic products as
food, clothing, electronics, appliances, and automobiles.  Since these
products require a high labor content in their production, lowering
labor costs will lower the retail price of these goods.  Reducing the
costs of consumer goods not only dampens inflation but also improves
the standard of living of all Americans and makes businesses more
competitive.
<P>
      The NAFTA also will expand U.S.  exports to Mexico, which will
greatly benefit the American economy.  Mexico already is America's
third largest trading partner, after Japan and Canada, and is growing
rapidly.  U.S.  exports to Mexico are heavily weighted toward the
high-value, high-technology products that are the foundation of future
U.S.  growth.  Growth in exports has been one of the major factors in
U.S.  economic growth over the past decade and a source of much of the
past and future job creation.  The U.S.  Department of Commerce
estimates 19,100 U.S.  jobs are created for every $1.0 billion
increase in U.S.  merchandise exports.  The NAFTA will lower Mexico's
trade barriers even further, ensuring that U.S.  exports to that
country will continue to increase.
<P>
Q:    Since the Mexican economy is so small, how can it become a
      sizeable market for U.S.  products?
<P>
      Although the Mexican economy is small compared to that of the
U.S., total U.S.-Mexico trade in 1992 was $73 billion (compared to
U.S.-German trade with $50 billion and U.S.-China trade with $33
billion), with $40.6 billion in U.S.  exports producing a surplus of
$6.8 billion.y (Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Jeffrey J.  Schott, NAFTA:  An
Assessment (Washington, D.C.:  Institute for International Economics,
1993), p.  14.)  By comparison, the U.S.  had a trade deficit with
China of $17.1 billion.
<P>
      U.S.  merchandise exports to Mexico support 611,000 American
jobs.  The Institute for International Economics, a non-partisan
research group that studies the effects of trade on the U.S.  economy,
projects that by 1995, over 1 million U.S.  jobs will be dependent on
U.S.  exports to Mexico.  The NAFTA is expected to spur growth in the
Mexican economy from between 3.5 percent and 6 percent annually during
the next ten years.
<P>
      Because Mexico will continue to buy most of its imports from the
U.S., opportunities for U.S.  business will grow as Mexico's economy
grows.  Currently, 73 percent of Mexico's imports come from the United
States.  In contrast, Hong Kong buys only 8.1 percent of its imports
from the U.S., Japan 22.9 percent, and Germany only 7.5 percent.  Each
Mexican purchases $300 worth of products every year from the U.S.,
compared to $30 of European imports.  The NAFTA will only add to the
advantages enjoyed by U.S.  businesses in Mexico.  Because the NAFTA
will reduce tariffs and restrictions on U.S.  and Canadian imports
into Mexico, while retaining them on imports from countries outside
the free trade zone, U.S.  businesses will see their competitive
advantage enhanced by the agreement.
<P>
Q:    How can an economy as underdeveloped as Mexico's help U.S. 
      businesses become more globally competitive, especially against
      East Asia?  Will a free trade pact with Mexico slow down the
      U.S.  economy?
<P>
      Far from being a threat to U.S.  prosperity, the disparity in
wage rates with Mexico (Mexican unskilled and semi-skilled wages are
seven times lower than in the U.S.) affords an important opportunity
for U.S.  businesses to become more competitive internationally by
emulating some of the successful practices of their East Asian
competitors.  Given the relatively high U.S.  wages, U.S.  industries
cannot adequately compete with foreign companies which use cheap
unskilled labor.  Unlike the U.S., such advanced industrial countries
in Asia as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have adjusted to competition
from labor-intensive, unskilled manufacturers in developing countries
like Mexico and Malaysia through a scheme known as "co-production."
<P>
      The manufacturing process is split between highly skilled
workers in the advanced countries and low-skilled workers in
developing countries, such as the People's Republic of China, the
Philippines, and Singapore.  This arrangement has allowed the advanced
East Asian countries to dominate global markets and rapidly expand
their own economies by lowering labor costs in the production of
goods.  Much of these countries' often-alleged "unfair advantage"
comes from their intelligent use of these resources to adapt to the
highly competitive environment of the international market.
<P>
      The U.S.  has been less successful than Japan and Taiwan at co-
production, mainly because there have been few developing countries
close to home whose economies complemented that of the U.S.  and which
were sufficiently open to allow easy operations.  The NAFTA will help
U.S.  companies co-produce more efficiently by combining operations in
the U.S.  and Mexico.  This will occur because of the more stable
business environment the NAFTA will create for U.S.  business
operating in Mexico.
<P>
      Those who oppose expanding such operations in Mexico, saying
they "export jobs," ignore a simple fact:  U.S.  operations will move
somewhere else if Mexico is closed to them, principally to East Asia,
with far less positive results for the U.S.  economy. 
<P>
      When American companies transfer part of their operations to
Mexico, most of their work force stays in the U.S., particularly in
administration, sales, warehousing, and components manufacturing.  For
instance, Ford Motor Company operates an assembly plant in Hermosillo,
Mexico, which produces small cars and engines for the U.S.  and
Mexican markets.  Over 75 percent of the components used at that plant
are produced in the U.S.y (Paul A.  London and Jonathan Whittle,
"Investment, Trade, and U.S.  Gains in the NAFTA" (Washington, D.C.: 
U.S.  Council of the Mexico-U.S.  Business Committee, 1992), p.  24.) 
Without this plant, Ford would be forced to produce these cars in Asia
or Europe, with practically no materials or services used in their
production coming from the U.S. 
<P>
      Investment by U.S.  companies in Mexico also increases U.S. 
exports.  For example, U.S.-Mexican joint ventures on average buy 51
percent of their materials and services from the U.S.  By contrast,
when U.S.  industries locate their operations in Pacific Rim countries
or in Europe, U.S.  firms supply only an average of 13 percent of the
materials and services to those companies.
<P>
      By making Mexico a more attractive investment opportunity than
East Asia, the NAFTA will encourage U.S.  companies that have already
moved assembly plants to faraway countries like Malaysia to relocate
to Mexico.  Once in Mexico, most of these assembly plants will benefit
the U.S.  economy by buying their components from U.S.  companies
instead of from East Asian suppliers, thereby providing more jobs for
U.S.  parts manufacturers, research and development, transportation
and shipping firms, and marketing companies.
<P>
Q:    Should not the U.S.  government be protecting workers from
      losing their jobs as a result of the NAFTA?  
<P>
      Like other industrialized nations, the U.S.  is confronted with
ever-increasing global economic competition.  Since World War II, the
wages of U.S.  workers have increased dramatically compared to those
of workers in the developing world.  Given this wage disparity for
unskilled labor, the U.S.  is faced with two choices:  It can
encourage American companies to focus on higher technology production
where the U.S.  has a comparative advantage, or it can provide
government protection in the form of higher tariffs and import quotas
for industries that employ large numbers of unskilled workers.  If the
U.S.  government chooses the second alternative, it will: 
<P>
1)    raise costs to U.S.  consumers; 
<P>
2)    encourage retaliation by other countries against U.S.  exports; 
<P>
3)    increase costs for U.S.  companies that use imports in their
      manufacturingprocesses and render them less globally
      competitive; and 
<P>
4)    ensure that the protected industries become ever more
      uncompetitive. 
<P>
      The temptation to use the government to protect inefficient
industries from competition should be resisted because for every
uncompetitive sector that is protected, the economy as a whole
suffers.  Government protection of threatened industries may help
small groups of people temporarily, but the costs, ultimately born by
the American consumer and the unprotected workers, are quite large.
<P>
      During the 1980s, for example, the steel industry received
government protection from foreign competition in the form of tariffs
and import quotas, ostensibly to protect an estimated 18,000 jobs
threatened by less expensive imported steel.  This protectionism
raised the cost of domestic and imported steel.  Many U.S. 
manufacturers that used steel in their production could not buy cheap
raw steel from abroad, raising the final cost of their products. 
These U.S.  manufacturers lost sales, costing 52,400 jobs in U.S. 
steel-related industries during the 1980s.y (Arthur T.  Denzau, "Can
Trade Protectionism Save Jobs," Center for the Study of American
Business, April 1987, p.  5.)  The U.S.  International Trade
Commission estimates quotas and tariffs on textiles and steel cost
consumers an additional $168,700 in 1988 dollars for every U.S.  job
saved by the protectionist measures.y (International Trade Commission,
"Economic Effects on U.S.  Imports Restraints:  Phase 1: 
Manufacturing," Pub.  2222, October 1989, p.  8.)  According to the
U.S.  General Accounting Office, the system of "voluntary" quotas the
U.S.  imposes on the Japanese automobiles costs American consumers
over $190,000 for every U.S.  job saved.  Clearly, the costs of
protectionism to the economy as a whole far outweigh any benefits to
individuals. 
<P>
      In contrast, the NAFTA, by facilitating co-production, will help
U.S.  companies to remain competitive in what they do best:  producing
high-technology goods and services for export and domestic use.  With
a more stable business environment in Mexico, U.S.  companies can have
many of their products assembled in Mexico for export abroad.  Those
who would erect artificial barriers in an attempt to protect
uncompetitive industries in the U.S.  would succeed only in reducing
the prospects for economic growth for everyone.
<P>
Q:    Will there be a massive loss of jobs as U.S.  companies move
      south in search of cheaper labor?
<P>
      During the presidential campaign, Ross Perot referred to a
"great sucking sound" being made as companies were pulled into Mexico,
attracted by cheaper labor.y (The Wall Street Journal, January 15,
1993, p.  A16.)  Nevertheless, in spite of dire warnings by Perot and
other opponents of the NAFTA, virtually all economists agree the NAFTA
will produce a net increase of U.S.  jobs over the next decade.y (For
the most recent study on job growth under the NAFTA, see Hufbauer and
Schott, op.  cit.)  By increasing opportunities for exports to Mexico,
the NAFTA will generate jobs throughout the entire economy.  And, as
more U.S.  companies engage in co-production, more U.S.  jobs will be
created as the American companies become more competitive in the
international market. 
<P>
      To be sure, some U.S.  companies will move a portion of labor-
intensive operations like the assembly of components to Mexico to take
advantage of the unskilled and semi-skilled labor.  The labor needed
to manufacture textiles, shoes, some glassware, and other labor-
intensive industries is too expensive in the U.S.  for them to remain
competitive.  But for most U.S.  industries, especially those upon
which the future growth and competitiveness of the U.S.  economy rest,
and which require highly skilled and trained workers, Mexican labor
will hold few attractions.
<P>
Q:    Will Mexico's lower labor costs depress wages in the United
      States?  
<P>
      If the NAFTA is approved, Mexico's economic modernization will
accelerate.  Since approximately 80 percent of all the capital
equipment Mexico buys is made in the U.S., U.S.  export industries are
likely to expand production and hire more U.S.  workers.  These
companies will not be tempted to relocate to Mexico because that
country's work force and infrastructure are not capable of supporting
high-technology production.  As Mexico grows, the demand for skilled
manufacturing in the U.S.  will grow, placing upward pressure on U.S. 
wages.
<P>
      Mexico is one of the fastest growing markets for U.S.  goods. 
The NAFTA will increase that market by forcing Mexico to lower trade
barriers that are on average 2.5 times higher than those in the U.S. 
The reduction in barriers by Mexico over the last several years has
resulted in a $6.8 billion trade surplus for the U.S.  in 1992.  That
surplus is projected to continue for the next fifteen to twenty years
as Mexico requires capital equipment to modernize, which will create
U.S.  jobs in export industries.
<P>
      President Clinton promised repeatedly in his campaign to expand
high-wage jobs for U.S.  workers.  Without a NAFTA, those high-wage
jobs will be more difficult to create because U.S.  businesses will
not be able to export to Mexico as easily as before.  Neither will
they be able to increase their efficiency through co-production
schemes in Mexico.  Japan's business sector not only has maintained
its generous wage levels but actually increased them through its high-
technology exports and its relocation of low-technology, low-paying
manufacturing jobs to developing countries like Malaysia and
Singapore.  This strategy has allowed Japanese companies to stay
competitive and reinvest in research and development and high-
technology production at home.
<P>
      Trade between the U.S.  and Mexico, up 200 percent since 1987,
will increase even more under the NAFTA, providing more U.S.  jobs in
such businesses as shipping, trucking, warehousing, and retailing that
will service the growing commercial base.  Increased sales to Mexico,
in turn, will cause U.S.  wages to rise. 
<P>
      For instance, the advanced countries of the European Economic
Community did not experience lower wages when the far less developed
economies of Greece, Portugal, and Spain joined the Community.y
(Michael Porter, The Competitive Advantage of Nations (New York:  The
Free Press, 1990), p.  50.)  Japan's co-production with Malaysia and
Singapore has not slowed the rapidly increasing prosperity of Japanese
workers.
<P>
      Opponents of free trade view international commerce as a fixed
economic pie:  job growth in manufacturing industries in country A
must mean job losses in manufacturing industries in country B. 
Opponents also believe that less expensive labor in one country will
depress wages in a country with more expensive labor, if they are
allowed to trade freely. 
<P>
      These views are mistaken.  Market economies are far more
sophisticated and dynamic than free trade opponents seem to realize. 
Jobs are created when economic activity increases and are lost when it
shrinks; wages respond to the demand for labor.  No modern economy is
static; only by adapting to changing conditions and making use of
opportunities can economies avoid stagnation.  Therefore, the NAFTA
will not only stimulate business activity across the U.S.  economy,
but also offer new business opportunities that will create jobs. 
Economic growth in Mexico will create jobs in export industries in the
U.S.
<P>
Q:    Will the abundant, unskilled labor in Mexico hurt unskilled,
      poorer workers in the U.S.?  
<P>
      In some cases, industries such as apparel and shoe manufacturing
that use high-cost, unskilled or semi-skilled labor will relocate
their assembly operations to Mexico.  However, most unskilled U.S. 
workers are located in the services sector; it employs 80 million
Americans, compared to 19 million in manufacturing.  The poorest
American workers are concentrated in service industries like
restaurants and retail stores.  These industries will not be
threatened by lower Mexican wages.  In fact, since low-wage Mexican
workers will tend to produce cheaper agricultural and consumer goods,
the services industries in the U.S.  that sell these goods will
benefit.
<P>
      In addition, the NAFTA will help reduce competition for
unskilled jobs by illegal immigrants.  Economic growth in Mexico will
remove much of the economic incentive for Mexicans to migrate to the
U.S.  in search of employment.  An estimated 2.5 million to 4 million
illegal immigrants from Mexico now work in the U.S.,y (Telephone
interview with Bureau of Labor Statistics, March 9, 1993.) almost
exclusively in the service sector in areas such as construction, food
services, and agriculture.
<P>
Q:    Why do labor unions oppose the NAFTA so adamantly?
<P>
      United Auto Workers Union President Owen Beiber expressed the
general sentiment of other labor unions about the NAFTA when he said
it was time to "stop tinkering with the damn thing and just say no." 
The Executive Council of the AFL-CIO issued a statement on February 17
calling for rejection of the NAFTA, saying it "would be a disaster for
millions of working people in the United States."y (Statement by the
AFL-CIO Executive Council on The North American Free Trade Agreement,
Bal Harbour, Florida, February 17, 1993.) 
<P>
      Although most labor unions resoundingly oppose the NAFTA, most
union workers stand to benefit from the agreement.  For example, while
the International Trade Commission estimates a 5 percent decrease in
automobile manufacturing in the next ten to fifteen years under the
NAFTA, the same study estimates a growth of 6 percent to 15 percent in
automotive parts exports during that period.y (International Trade
Commission, "Potential Impact on the U.S.  Economy and Selected
Industries of the North American Free Trade Agreement," Report to the
Committee on Ways and Means of the United States House of
Representative and the Committee on Finance of the United States
Senate, U.S.I.T.C Publication 2596, January 1993, p.  2-8.)
<P>
      Certain apparel industries may move south, but the textile
industry is projected to increase exports by 13 percent under NAFTA. 
Unions in the service sector, such as the Teamsters, will benefit from
the agreement because of increases in cross-border trucking and
warehousing.  Even in the areas that will experience job loss, the
loss is minor, such as 6 percent to 15 percent loss in flat glass and
major household appliance manufacturing, and less than 5 percent over
the long term in the U.S.  automotive industry.y (Ibid.)   
<P>
      Most surprising is labor union opposition to an agreement that
will spur growth in export industries where most high-wage jobs are
located.  The International Trade Commission estimates that workers in
export manufacturing industries earn wages 17 percent higher than
workers in non-export related manufacturing.  Estimates are the U.S. 
will have a $7 billion to $9 billion trade surplus with Mexico by
1995.  That means an estimated 200,000 to 350,000 additional jobs in
U.S.  export industries.y ("Guide to the North American Free Trade
Agreement:  What It Means for U.S.  Business," U.S.  Chamber of
Commerce, International Division, 1992, p.  25.)
<P>
      Of larger concern to the unions should be U.S.  economic
competitiveness.  Union jobs in uncompetitive industries cannot long
survive without government assistance, which eventually dooms an
industry to hopeless inefficiency.  Job security, as well as standards
of living, rest directly upon finding ways of enhancing the
competitiveness of U.S.  business.  Without a NAFTA, however, U.S. 
industries will have difficulty co-producing like the Japanese and
Europeans.  This could lead to much larger losses of jobs in the
medium to long term, as foreign businesses gain a larger share of the
U.S.  market at the expense of inefficient U.S.  producers. 
Industries will also have a harder time exporting to countries like
Mexico if those countries maintain high trade barriers.
<P>
Q:    Will NAFTA expand maquiladora industries, causing greater loss
      of U.S.  jobs?
<P>
      U.S.  companies have been operating assembly co-production or
maquiladora -- plants along the U.S.-Mexico border since 1965.  Under
the maquiladora program, components made in the U.S.  are sent to
Mexico for assembly, utilizing Mexico's less expensive labor.  The
finished products are then sent back to the U.S.  or exported abroad. 
Despite frequent charges that the maquiladora program has hurt the
U.S.  economy, it has not caused a net loss of U.S.  jobs.  To the
contrary, by reducing labor costs, this program has allowed
manufacturers to remain globally competitive and keep their U.S. 
plants operating.
<P>
      During the early 1970s, U.S.  corporations faced stiff
competition from foreign companies exporting cheaper goods to the U.S. 
With the U.S.  paying relatively high wages for unskilled labor, U.S. 
companies that used high percentages of unskilled labor in their
production processes found it hard to compete against these foreign
providers.  To stay in business U.S.  companies were forced to move
the labor-intensive part of their production to countries where labor
was less expensive.  Most of this co-production in Mexico takes place
in the maquiladora program.
<P>
      Co-production with Mexico has helped many U.S.  companies face
international competition and increase exports.  For instance, the
Mexico-based Trasgo Group is working with U.S.-based Tyson Foods
Company in the growing and packaging of poultry products, 50 percent
of which is being sold in Japan.  General Motors' Packard Electric
Division assembles sophisticated components that are produced in its
Ohio and Mississippi plants and assembled in plants throughout Mexico. 
The Company has remained internationally competitive only by lowering
labor costs on the unskilled portion of its manufacturing.  AT&T has
several facilities in Mexico for manufacturing and phone equipment
repair.  AT&T plans to shift its Asian supply base to Mexico,
providing components manufacturing jobs in the U.S.  Moving facilities
to Mexico will help AT&T produce for the U.S./Mexico market and
beyond.y (London and Whittle, op.  cit., p.  24.)
<P>
      The NAFTA will eliminate maquiladora rules that prevent U.S. 
companies from selling in Mexico the products they assemble there. 
Formerly, maquiladoras could sell only 20 percent of their products in
Mexico.y (U.S.  Department of Labor, "Economic Discussion Paper #29,"
August 1988, p.  17.)  Under the NAFTA, U.S.  companies with
maquiladoras can sell 100 percent of their products in the Mexican
market. 
<P>
Q:    Will NAFTA make it easier for Mexico to flood the U.S.  with
      goods? 
<P>
      NAFTA opponents paint a grim picture of truckloads of cheap
Mexican products heading north, flooding U.S.  markets and putting
U.S.  producers of similar goods out of work.  Freer trade with Mexico
in the past four years, however, has demonstrated the reverse to be
true.  As barriers to trade have been removed, the U.S.  has exported
more to Mexico than it imported.  Under the NAFTA, these barriers will
fall even farther and U.S.  exports will continue to grow.  Because
Mexican tariffs to U.S.  goods are 2.5 times greater than U.S. 
tariffs on Mexican goods, U.S.  exporters will benefit from trade more
than their Mexican counterparts.  The majority of U.S.  exports to
Mexico are in automotive parts, telecommunications equipment,
electronic components, processed foods, and basic grains, which
currently are subjected to Mexican import quotas and tariffs that
raise the costs of these goods from 10 percent to 20 percent.
<P>
      Currently, only 17.9 percent of U.S.  goods enter Mexico without
tariffs.  Once NAFTA becomes law, half of U.S.  exports will enter
Mexico duty-free.  After five years, under the NAFTA, 67 percent of
U.S.  exports will be duty-free.  That percentage rises to 80 after
ten years.y (International Trade Commission, "Potential Impact," p. 
104.)  The apocalyptic scenarios by opponents seem especially
exaggerated because the U.S.  has had trade surpluses with Mexico for
the past three years.  Those surpluses are widely projected to
continue as Mexico imports U.S.  capital equipment needed to modernize
its economy.  Although Mexico has in the past attempted to restrict
such imports, it will be forbidden to do so under the NAFTA. 
<P>
      The NAFTA also removes non-tariff barriers to U.S.  exports. 
For instance, today U.S.  auto makers need import licenses to sell
U.S.-produced cars in Mexico.  U.S.  auto makers with auto assembly
plants in Mexico have also been under restrictions, known as export
quotas, that require U.S.  automobile companies with plants in Mexico
to export $2 of automotive products for every $1 of U.S.  automotive
products imported into Mexico.y (Hufbauer and Schott, op.  cit., p. 
39.)  These restrictions are also eliminated under the NAFTA, giving
U.S.  auto makers greater flexibility to export to Mexico from U.S. 
plants.
<P>
Q:    Will freer trade with Mexico benefit only the Southeastern
      states while hurting the industrial states of the Northeast and
      Midwest?
<P>
      Almost all fifty states have substantially increased their
exports to Mexico in the last five years as Mexican barriers to trade
have dropped.  In Arkansas, exports to Mexico grew 154 percent from
1987 to 1991.  In Michigan 31,000 jobs depend on exports to Mexico;
from 1987 to 1991 exports to Mexico rose 51 percent.y (U.S.  Exports
to Mexico:  A State-by-State Overview 1987-1991 (U.S.  Department of
Commerce, International Trade Administration, July 1992), p.  32.) 
Surprisingly, many Members of Congress who oppose the NAFTA, such as
Congressman Donald Pease of Ohio, and Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell of Maine, come from states which have experienced net gains
in employment because of growing U.S.  exports to Mexico.  For
example, Ohio Senator Howard Metzenbaum is opposed to the NAFTA; but
between 1987 and 1991 his state's exports to Mexico increased 137
percent to $582 million.  Over the same period, New York's exports to
Mexico increased 73 percent, providing new jobs for thousands of
workers.  Mexico represents the third largest export market for
Illinois, Michigan, New York, and Pennsylvania, and the second largest
market for Maine, New Hampshire, and Ohio.  Mexico is the largest
export market for California and Texas.  Pennsylvania Senator Harris
Wofford's election platform included an anti-NAFTA stance; yet
Pennsylvania's exports to Mexico have climbed 283 percent since 1987
to $694 million in 1991, creating approximately 9,000 additional jobs
for Pennsylvania workers.y (For a more comprehensive state-by-state
analysis on exports to Mexico, see ibid.)
<P>
PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT UNDER THE NAFTA
<P>
Q:    Will American companies move to Mexico to avoid strict
      environmental laws in the U.S.?
<P>
      Almost all environmental and labor groups argue that lax
environmental enforcement and lower standards in Mexico give an unfair
advantage to companies based there.  Lower standards, they say, will
encourage U.S.  companies to reduce environmental compliance costs by
moving their factories to Mexico.
<P>
      Such criticism, however, overlooks a number of facts. 
<P>
1)    Mexico's environmental laws and regulations are roughly equal to
      those in the U.S.  In fact, the Mexican environmental agency,
      Secretaria del Desarrollo Urbano y Ecologia (SEDUE), is adopting
      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards wholesale; 
<P>
2)    Most multinational companies already follow U.S.  environmental
      standards when operating in Mexico; and 
<P>
3)    For most industries, the difference in environmental compliance
      costs between Mexico and the U.S.  is not substantial.
<P>
      For example, Mexican laws regulating the transportation of
cross-border toxic waste are equivalent to those in the U.S.  Mexican
regulations require any U.S.  company locating within 62 miles (100
kilometers) of the U.S.-Mexico border to comply with all EPA standards
on the disposal of toxic wastes.  Under new Mexican environmental
laws, any U.S.  company using toxic materials in Mexican plants must
dispose of these materials and their waste by-products by shipping
them back to the U.S.
<P>
      SEDUE's civil penalties for violations include plant closure, up
to $80,000 in fines for first-time violators, and administrative
arrest of company officials for up to 36 hours; criminal penalties
include up to six years in prison.  Mexican environmental regulators
also have policing powers that their U.S.  counterparts regulators do
not.  Although enforcement of Mexico's environmental laws has not been
perfect, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has shown a strong
commitment to environmental protection since taking office. 
Government expenditures for environmental enforcement have increased
1,800 percent to $1.8 billion in 1991. 
<P>
      In some specific cases, U.S.  companies have relocated to Mexico
for environmental reasons.  However, this has usually been in response
to draconian environmental regulations on air emissions in U.S. 
cities rather than lax standards in Mexico.  For instance, several
furniture makers based in the Los Angeles area basin moved their
facilities to Tijuana, Mexico, when new rules by the state and local
governments placed extremely low limits on the use of solvent-based
paint and stain emissions.  Although many of those companies moved to
Tijuana, some relocated to neighboring states like Arizona and Nevada. 
According to a study by the U.S.  Trade Representative's Inter-Agency
Task Force, this relocation was not part of a general flight of U.S. 
industry to Mexico to avoid general environmental standards.y ("Review
of U.S.-Mexico Environmental Issues," Prepared by an Inter-Agency Task
Force Coordinated by the Office of the United States Trade
Representative, Draft, October 1991, p.  194.  (The Trade Policy Staff
of the Inter-Agency Task Force, during six public hearings held from
August 20 to September 11, 1991, gathered data on the alleged movement
of U.S.  companies to Mexico for environmental reasons.  They found
these allegations to be untrue, except in the specific case of
furniture refinishing companies relocating from Los Angeles to Mexico
and other U.S.  states.))
<P>
      Most U.S.  companies have little incentive to move south to
avoid strict U.S.  environmental standards because Mexico operates by
those same standards.  According to this Task Force study, "U.S. 
firms, particularly the larger multinational firms most likely to
undertake large process industry investments [in Mexico], often hold
subsidiaries to a worldwide standard, usually at least as high as
standards with which they must comply in the U.S."y (Ibid., p.  195.) 
An example is Ford Motor Company, which has a policy of applying U.S. 
environmental practices in its automotive manufacturing plants in
Mexico.
<P>
Q:    Will economic growth in Mexico lead to more environmental
      degradation in that country, and North America generally?
<P>
      Some environmental groups oppose the NAFTA because it will
promote economic growth in Mexico.  These critics are against economic
development because of the increase of pollution that development
brings.  Thus, they believe the best way of improving the environment
is to prevent economic growth from taking place. 
<P>
      Environmental critics of the NAFTA misunderstand the
relationship between economic development and a clean environment. 
Without economic growth, Mexico can never adequately address its
environmental problems.  As countries become wealthier, the priorities
of their people change from subsistence living to such quality of life
concerns as environmental protection.  That is why every
industrialized country spends a far greater percentage of its GDP on
environmental protection than any underdeveloped country.  When the
choice is between jobs and stricter environmental standards, poorer
countries choose jobs.
<P>
      When Mexican companies were heavily debt-ridden and on the verge
of bankruptcy during the 1980s, it was difficult for the government to
force compliance with environmental regulations.  The reason:  the
government feared throwing people out of work by closing polluting
factories.  Only with economic growth does sustained environmental
improvement become possible.
<P>
      Of 42 countries analyzed in a recent Princeton University study,
pollution levels began to decrease in those with per capita GDP rising
above $4,000 to $5,000.  Mexico, with a current per capita GDP of
$3,700, already is beginning to devote larger resources toward
environmental purposes.  Example:  a 200 percent increase in
environmental inspectors since 1989.  This process will continue as
the economy grows.  Unfortunately, Mexico's growth would be stalled
without the NAFTA, postponing future environmental protection.
<P>
Q:    Is extensive government regulation necessary to protect the
      North American environment?  
<P>
      Economic growth is not inherently harmful to the environment;
pervasive government intervention in industry and commerce is. 
Surprisingly, some U.S.  labor and environmental groups are promoting
traditional protectionism as the best way to avert further
environmental degradation in Mexico.  For instance, labor groups are
advocating placing tariffs on goods produced in Mexican factories that
have lower environmental standards than those in the U.S.
<P>
      Mexico, like many socialist countries in Eastern Europe, has
learned that planned economies and authoritarian governments have
created far more seriously degraded environments than their free
market, democratic counterparts.  For most of the period since the
1930s, Mexico has been ruled by an authoritarian, quasi-socialist
government.  The economy was subjected to central planning and
control, and the Mexican government protected domestic industries
through high import tariffs, quotas, and licensing.  The government
also created an enormously burdensome system of rules and regulations
to shield workers from exploitation, control production, and direct
resources to government priorities.
<P>
      The result of this legacy was not only economic ruin but
environmental degradation.  Protectionism and overregulation made
domestic industries inefficient and wasteful, impoverished the country
as a whole, and discouraged private investment.  Without new capital,
antiquated polluting factories could not be replaced with more modern,
cleaner ones.  Nationalized or heavily regulated industries also had
little reason to obey existing environmental laws, since the
government was loath to punish its own companies or companies it so
closely directed.
<P>
      Inefficient production eventually led to excessive pollution in
Mexico.  For example, 76 percent of the air pollution in Mexico City
comes from automobiles using low-grade leaded gasoline refined by the
inefficiently run, government-owned oil monopoly PEMEX.  Most of the
remaining 24 percent of the air pollution in Mexico City comes from
factories, two-thirds of which were controlled or owned by the
government before privatization began five years ago.
<P>
      Now environmentalists and labor unions wish to create a complex
set of regulations as part of the NAFTA.  They argue that only the
government has the detached interest and expertise needed to set
priorities, direct private funds, and mandate industry practices and
procedures in order to protect the environment.  There is no evidence,
however, that new central planning of North America's production and
commerce will protect the environment.  In fact, the U.S.  government
has a lackluster record of protecting the environment through complex
regulations.  For example, the environmental Superfund, designed to
assist in toxic waste cleanups has produced steady employment for
lawyers, accountants, and consultants, while failing to adequately
address environmental cleanup.  Additional government intervention is
most likely to lead to further wasteful spending without a
commensurate improvement in the environment. 
<P>
Q:    Will the maquiladora industry simply expand under the NAFTA,
      causing more pollution along the U.S.-Mexico border?
<P>
      Some environmentalists charge that the maquiladora industry has
ruined the environment along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexican border.  They
argue that NAFTA would spread this problem throughout Mexico by
encouraging maquiladora-type operations throughout the entire country.
<P>
      There are two main environmental problems plaguing the border
region:  a lack of sewage systems and other infrastructure to service
the population, and facilities and resources to dispose of and clean
up contaminants dumped into the environment by industry.  Both of
these problems result from the tax codes under which the maquiladora
program operates, not the development resulting from the maquiladora
program.
<P>
      For example, under existing laws, local authorities have little
power to tax industry involved in maquiladora operations.  American
companies can locate in a Mexican state along the border, but are
required to pay taxes only in the U.S.  state where the company is
incorporated.  This has effectively impoverished the Mexican side of
the border region, denying it essential tax revenues from its major
industry with which to build infrastructure, monitor compliance of
environmental regulations, and dispose of industrial waste.
<P>
      Under the NAFTA, however, the preferences that maquiladora
industries in the border region now enjoy relative to other areas in
Mexico will be eliminated.  The Mexican federal system and the states
in the U.S.  will be able to set their own taxes.  This will provide
municipalities and regional governments with the funds to build the
sewage systems, waste dumps, and water purification systems they need.

<P>
RULE OF LAW, SOVEREIGNTY, AND PARTICIPATION UNDER THE AGREEMENT
<P>

Q:    Will cross-border commercial disputes under the NAFTA be decided
      in a way that infringes on U.S.  sovereignty?  
<P>
      Liberal and conservative critics of the NAFTA charge that the
agreement infringes on national sovereignty and limits local power to
control laws, enforce environmental standards, and uphold health and
safety regulations.  For instance, Ralph Nader's Public Citizen group
alleges that the NAFTA will prevent local governments from setting
limits on pesticide use or regulations on how milk is processed.
<P>
      However, NAFTA dispute mechanisms will give U.S.  citizens and
businesses more direct participation in resolving commercial,
environmental, and investment disputes between the three countries, by
allowing them their day in court.
<P>
      The NAFTA rules for settling commercial disputes arising under
the agreement are similar to those of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade
Agreement (FTA) of 1988.  Under the FTA, regular cross-border
commercial disputes are settled by either country's domestic courts. 
The free trade agreement with Canada does not limit domestic control
over these types of commercial disputes.  The same is true of the
NAFTA.  Under the NAFTA, traditional commercial disputes will be
handled by the courts that would naturally have jurisdiction in such
cases -- depending on the type of commercial activity and the
jurisdiction the parties had agreed to in advance.
<P>
      The U.S.-Canada agreement mandates the creation of expert panels
to determine whether a government's laws, regulations, and policies
violate its rules.  These panels are made up of experts appointed by
each country.  The NAFTA also requires the creation of similar panels
to decide NAFTA-related disputes.  However, as with the FTA, the NAFTA
panels do not have the power to force a country to abide by its
decisions.  For instance, in the case of countervailing duty and anti-
dumping disputes, a party can challenge a panel decision by requesting
a special review panel.  If the party's government objects to the
finding of the review panel, it can suspend the binational panel
system entirely.  Despite this lack of enforcement power, these panels
have worked smoothly and effectively to resolve trade disputes.
<P>
      State, local, and national governments are free to set higher
environmental, health, and safety standards of their own under the
NAFTA.  Such standards can only be challenged through NAFTA panels if
they are based on political rather than scientific considerations or
discriminate against imports.  Thus, the power to enforce U.S.  laws,
regulations, and standards through domestic courts ultimately remains
in the hands of domestic national, state, and local governments. 
<P>
      The dispute panels, in turn, will help U.S.  companies seek
redress for violations of the law in Mexico and Canada that
traditionally have been difficult to obtain.  For instance, conflicts
arising over lax enforcement in protecting such intellectual property
as patents will be decided by panels created under the NAFTA.  This
will help U.S.  companies recoup the approximately $900 million they
lose annually because of non-existent or lax enforcement of
intellectual property rights in Canada and Mexico.y (Exact figures on
past losses are unavailable.  However, the International Trade
Commission estimates that in 1986 U.S.  companies lost $533 million to
Mexico and $367 million in Canada due to non-enforcement of
intellectual property rights.)
<P>
Q:    Will citizens be prohibited from participating in the judicial
      process in disputes that arise under the NAFTA?
<P>
      Ideological opponents of the NAFTA, such as the Alliance for
Responsible Trade and the Citizen Trade Campaign, have called the
dispute resolution mechanisms in the NAFTA undemocratic and secretive
because these allegedly do not provide the "broadest possible
participation by workers, consumers, environmentalists, and human
rights organizations."y (Letter to Members of Congress from the
Alliance For Responsible Trade/Citizen Trade Campaign, December 15,
1992.)
<P>
      However, NAFTA commissions and panels review only disputes
arising out of interpretations of the agreement itself.  NAFTA
commissions will not review regular commercial disputes between
companies.  The vast majority of commercial disputes will be decided
by the domestic courts of the country which have jurisdiction over the
dispute.  The NAFTA will not change the long-standing tradition of
commercial law.  Both legal systems (America's common law and Mexico's
civil or code-based law) allow only those parties whose involvement
gave rise to the dispute to be directly involved in the judicial
process.  If numerous parties, each with separate grievances, were
allowed to participate in the same judicial proceeding, the government
could not narrow the issues being adjudicated or ever come to a final
decision based in law.  Since the NAFTA dispute panels will have the
right to assess penalties against a company, the issues in a dispute
need to be narrowly defined by law.  So, too, should the parties that
can participate in the dispute.     
<P>
      Balancing the grievances of numerous groups is a challenge more
appropriately addressed by legislatures, not courts.  To allow an
open-ended participation "for cases involving challenges to social
legislation"y (Ibid.) would turn the judicial process into a purely
political one.  Although parties not directly involved in a judicial
proceeding may be harmed by a court's decision, using the judicial
process to address their grievances would weaken the rule of law in
commercial disputes, and make a mockery of stable commercial
transactions.  This, in turn, would reduce commercial activity between
the two countries. 
<P>
Q:    Was the NAFTA negotiated hastily, in secret, with little or
      noparticipation by citizens groups, unions, or Congress?
<P>
      The NAFTA was negotiated by the Bush Administration under "fast
track" authority given it by Congress.  In giving the President fast
track authority, Congress agrees in advance to either approve or
reject the negotiated agreement as a whole, without amendments.  Fast
track negotiating procedures, authorized in the 1974 Trade Act, have
given several Presidents the power to conclude trade agreements that
would not later be unravelled by the Congress.
<P>
      Some special interest groups, however, oppose fast track
authority because it limits their ability to influence Congress. 
Thus, apparel and shoe manufacturers, and many unions which seek
protection from foreign competition, argue that the NAFTA was
negotiated in secret with little participation by groups affected by
the accord.
<P>
      In fact, fast track procedures required the Administration to
work closely with Congress, labor, business, and environmental groups
during the course of the negotiations.  Months before formal
negotiations began between the U.S.  and Mexico in July 1991, Congress
held a series of hearings on the NAFTA where all issues were presented
by groups opposing and supporting the agreement.  Congressional
opponents of the agreement like Congressman Richard Gephardt, the
Democrat from Missouri, made their preferences known to the
Administration at that time. 
<P>
      Fast track procedures do not produce secret negotiations. 
Because they are rules that Congress has imposed on itself, fast track
procedures do not limit congressional power to control trade issues,
and can be overridden at any time.  These procedures simply limit the
ability of special interest groups with well-financed lobbying efforts
to undermine an agreement that would be acceptable to Congress as a
whole.
<P>
Q:    Should the agreement be renegotiated since a new President will
      have to implement the agreement?
<P>
      Now that the White House is occupied by a new President, NAFTA
opponents are portraying the agreement as a Republican accord that
must be renegotiated to accommodate the new policies of Bill Clinton. 
However, free trade in general and the NAFTA in particular are not
partisan issues.  The NAFTA was not planned, debated, or negotiated
along partisan lines.  Some of the strongest NAFTA supporters, such as
former Texas Senator and now Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and New
Mexico Congressman Bill Richardson, are Democrats.  In addition,
President Clinton himself has long supported the agreement.  The U.S. 
needs to demonstrate continuity and reliability in its dealings with
foreign countries on trade issues if its interests are to be
effectively advanced.
<P>
Q:    Should NAFTA incorporate a "social charter" similar to the model
      the European Community has adopted?
<P>
      Some groups opposing free trade are demanding that the Clinton
Administration adopt a European-style social charter through the
parallel negotiations on labor and environmental issues.  A NAFTA that
heavily regulates labor and environmental issues would be an albatross
for U.S.  competitiveness and significantly reduce the level of
potential exports to Mexico from small and medium-sized U.S. 
businesses.  A regulated commercial accord, modeled after Europe's
Social Charter, would also set a bad precedent for future regional
accords and multilateral trade agreements like the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), leading to an overall reduction in global
trade. 
<P>
      Including non-commercial issues into a trade accord provides
protectionists and others who oppose free trade in principle with
endless excuses to raise trade barriers.  Labor relations,
environmental protection, and political reform are far more
complicated for governments to manage than traditional commercial
activities.  The result is usually a trade arrangement that increases
government intervention, regulation, and bureaucracy and decreases the
amount of trade the agreement was intended to encourage.
<P>
      The example of the European Community is instructive.  Although
the European Community set out to create a single market by removing
barriers to trade, the economic benefits of this opening have been
more than offset by the imposition of a heavy regulatory burden in a
wide-ranging social charter that mandates costly standards for labor,
wages, and the environment.  A vast and unelected bureaucracy has
arisen to administer these regulations, armed with extensive
regulatory and enforcement powers.
<P>
      Groups calling for a social charter speak of the virtues of
global environmentalism and worker safety.  Creating enforcement
commissions, citizen's courts, and sanctions for divergent
environmental and labor standards -- the wish list of groups seeking a
social charter -- may appear to be cost-free.  Unfortunately, an
environmental and social charter imposed on North American commerce
will take on a regulatory life of its own, forcing U.S.  business to
waste time and money dealing with expanding regulatory bureaucracies
-- money which would be better spent on investment.  Companies with
little political clout and few Washington lobbyists, especially small
and medium-sized businesses, would be the principal victims.
<P>
      Recent federal overregulation of U.S.  small and medium-sized
businesses provides an illustrative example.  Between 1989 and 1992,
increased environmental, labor, and health regulations imposed by
Congress cost U.S.  business an additional $130 billion.  Small
businesses were hit with a 34 percent increase in government
regulations that significantly slowed job growth in the small business
sector after 1990.  The Congressional Joint Economic Committee called
this federal regulatory intrusiveness "economic crib death." 
Increasing these burdens on U.S.  exporters by imposition of an
ambitious social charter would only further damage U.S. 
competitiveness.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
      The U.S.  and Mexico have had a long and often difficult history
as neighbors.  For the last 150 years, cooperation between the two
countries has been more the exception than the rule.  Today, however,
America and Mexico are entering a new era, one characterized by
increasing cooperation.  By removing the barriers to trade and
investment that limit the growth of both countries, NAFTA will
contribute not only to a cementing of good bilateral relations, but
also to expanding economic opportunity throughout North America.
<P>
      Fortunately, Mexico's modernization coincides with America's
need to remain internationally competitive as it enters the 21st
century.  The world's largest exporter, the U.S.  will rely
increasingly upon international trade for its prosperity, which will
require reducing barriers to trade world-wide.  By creating a free
trade area in North America, the NAFTA will help American industry
grow at home and remain competitive abroad, while also giving a major
boost to global free trade.
<P>
      Despite the fact that all objective studies of the effects of
the NAFTA clearly indicate that it will benefit all three countries,
there is significant political opposition to the agreement in the U.S. 
Although many of the concerns raised are real, much of the opposition
is based upon a desire to protect the special interests of politically
powerful constituencies who are opposed to free trade.
<P>
      There are indeed many problems in both Mexico and the U.S.  that
the agreement does not solve, such as environmental pollution.  But
the best method of addressing these is not through the creation of yet
another regulatory bureaucracy that will inevitably limit economic
growth, but through the increased prosperity that free trade will
bring.
<P>
      While not perfect, the NAFTA is a major step forward from the
existing relationship between Mexico and the U.S.  A rejection of the
NAFTA, or a renegotiation of it to produce more governmental control
of trade, would do little to protect U.S.  jobs or promote
environmental protection.  In fact, a managed North American free
trade zone could be worse than the existing trading system with
Mexico.  It would raise the costs for small and medium-size U.S. 
businesses and limit private resources available for environmental
protection.  Under a managed trade system, power would flow to the
numerous government bureaucrats and industry lawyers that would result
from increases in regulations in order to "manage" trade.
<P>
      The NAFTA is a culmination of two years of close cooperation
between the U.S., Mexican and Canadian governments.  The NAFTA
represents decades of increased trade among the three countries.  Its
creation will put the U.S.  firmly on a more competitive footing with
other industrialized nations into the 21st century.  This will be good
for U.S.  businesses and U.S.  workers alike.

Backgrounder #896<BR>

<P>

INTRODUCTION 
<P> In the first week of June, an international "Earth summit" will
convene in Rio deJaneiro, Brazil, to discuss environmental issues and
their relationship to economic development. (For an analysis of the
circumstances leading up to the conference see Christopher M. Gacek
and James Malone, "Guidelines for the U.N. Environmental Conference,"
Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 874, January 28, 1992.) The
leaders of the majority of the world's countries are expected to
attend. Last week, President Bush announced that he will attend. 
<P> This summit, formally called the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development, or UNCED, will discuss issues ranging
from the distribution of wealth among nations and women's rights to
deforestation. But the topic that will attract the most attention and
controversy is the claim that the Earth is subject to steady and
potentially damaging rise in temperature -- a phenomenon known as
"global warming" -- and that this condition is in large part a
byproduct of Western industrial growth. 
<P> While recent preparatory negotiations did not include binding
agreements on targets and timetables for reducing emissions of carbon
dioxide (CO2) and other so-called "greenhouse gases," the U.S. will
come under enormous pressure at the conference, from other countries
and many environmental groups, to sign a treaty curbing greenhouse gas
emissions. These greenhouse gases occur in nature but also are caused
by human activity, such as by burning fossil fuels. They are
responsible for making the earth sufficiently warm to permit the
existence of life, and are thus essential. The concern is that the
build-up of these gases in the atmosphere could warm the planet more
than would otherwise be the case, and that this global warming could
lead to adverse changes in the world's ecology. At the extreme, some
environmentalists say, parts of the Earth could become subject to
flooding and tidal waves because of rising sea levels caused by
melting polar ice caps, and drought-induced crop failures could
trigger global famine. 
<P> In spite of these fears, the accumulated scientific data do not
support such dire predictions, showing the cataclysmic results to be
either highly improbable or simply wrong. Moreover, there is enormous
uncertainty associated with the scientific methodology used to predict
future climate changes. Among the difficulties: 
<UL>
      Climate change computer models that predict warming often rely
      on assumptions and simplifications that raise questions about
      their reliability. Example: one model effectively moved the
      Earth's orbit 2 million miles closer to the sun.

<P> Models do not accurately account for the influence of important
      climate factors, such as the behavior and effect of clouds and
      oceans.

<P>      There are shortcomings in the data. Example: temperature records
      over the last century may incorrectly suggest warming because
      many weather stations are close to growing cities.

  <P>    Temperature observations over the last century are inconsistent
      with the predictions of global warming theories.
      
  <P>    A competing theory, based on the hypothesis that solar activity
      may be the major factor in climate change, is more consistent
      with temperature observations in the northern hemisphere during
      the last century.

  <P>    Furthermore, even if most scientists and policy makers were
      convinced that some level of warming is occurring and will
      continue, three questions have to be answered.
 </UL>     
<P>Question #1: Is the Earth warming as a result of human-caused
      greenhouse gases or because of natural phenomena?

<P>Question #2: If the planet is experiencing a major warming trend, 
      in what way will this warming take place? Will the Earth warm 
      up substantially at night with days cooling slightly? Will the
      warming occur in the tropical regions, or only in the high
      latitudes around the poles? Will the warming occur in the summer
      or the winter? These questions are important because a single
      figure suggesting the average temperature of all regions of the
      world for all times of day and night during the entire year is a
      meaningless statistic. It ignores variations amid the warming
      trend that would have very different -- and not necessarily
      harmful -- effects in different regions.

<P>Question #3: What will be the effect of any changes in the climate?
      Will the ocean levels rise, resulting in worldwide flooding? Or
      will they fall, expanding earth's landmass? Will worldwide
      agricultural production increase thanks to more crops in areas
      now too cold for major cultivation -- helping to alleviate world
      hunger -- or will it decrease, prompting famine in some regions?
       
<P> The existing scientific evidence does not give clear answers to
these questions. But the decisions made by policy makers at the United
Nations conference and elsewhere could have enormous implications for
the Earth's inhabitants. Moves to slow down economic growth in the
western industrialized countries, for instance, could have the
unintended effect of slowing economic growth also in the poorest
countries. Indeed, poor countries would be disproportionately
affected.

<P> The economic costs to Americans from enacting policies to
address the perceived problem of global warming would be less
dramatic, yet significant. Consider one proposal -- imposing a "carbon
tax" of $100 per ton, designed to reduce industry's carbon emissions
to the 1990 level by the year 2000. The Congressional Budget Office
estimates this tax would reduce the Gross National Product (GNP) of
America by two percent. This would result in a loss to the economy of
approximately $100 billion per year, or about $1,200 per household.
Further, the increase in unemployment by the year 1997 would be an
estimated 700,000 jobs.

<P> To be sure, if the economic, environmental, and health costs
associated with global warming are as large as some fear, then the
side-effects of reducing CO2 might be smaller compared with the
dangers of inaction. This leads to the question asked by many
environmentalists and policy makers: "Isn't it worth buying an
insurance policy against global warming regardless of cost, since the
consequences could be so severe?" 

<P> This is a reasonable question, but the answer is not necessarily
"Yes." The decision to buy an insurance policy depends not only on the
possible consequences of not doing so, but on the probability of those
consequences. With a high level of uncertainty, such as that
associated with global warming, other measures might be more prudent. 

<P> To determine if the world should buy an expensive insurance
policy against global warming, the probability of harm occurring must
be multiplied by the likely magnitude of the harm. If the resulting
expected harm is higher than the economic and social cost, then buying
an insurance policy makes sense. If the expected harm is lower than
the cost, it does not make sense to do so. Although it is difficult,
if not impossible, precisely to quantify the expected harm from global
warming, lawmakers must attempt this calculation if they are to
develop sensible, cost-effective policies.
<P>

WHAT IS GLOBAL WARMING?

<P> One of the main subjects to be addressed at UNCED is global
warming. While most Americans have heard of the phenomenon, few
understand it, and there is widespread confusion between global
warming and another term -- the "greenhouse effect." 

<P> The greenhouse effect, on the one hand, refers to the fact that
the earth releases gases, called greenhouse gases, which enable the
atmosphere to retain some of the heat received from the sun rather
than reflecting all of it back out into space. These gases thus have
the same effect as glass in a greenhouse, which is to keep the Earth
at a higher average temperature, and a more even temperature, than
would be the case without the gases. These gases include carbon
dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide, and water vapor. The greenhouse
effect maintains the Earth at a temperature which allows plant and
animal life to exist. Contrary to popular belief, all scientists agree
that the greenhouse effect is desirable. Indeed, without it, life as
we know it on Earth would cease because global temperatures would
average -18C, or 0F. Explains Patrick Michaels, State Climatologist
for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the statement that all scientists
agree that the greenhouse effect is real "is about as profound as a
statement that all scientists agree that the Earth is round." (Patrick
Michaels, "Apocalypse Not Now: Science, Politics, and Global Warming
(Part 1)," National Chamber Foundation, U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
March, 1992.)

<P> Global warming, technically known as the "enhanced greenhouse
effect," on the other hand, is a term used to describe temperature
increases allegedly caused by humans over some period of time. This
theory rests on the claim that certain gases released by human
activity warm the planet significantly. These gases include carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are released naturally into
the atmosphere. (Water vapor, which is the primary greenhouse gas, is
not increased by human activity. Water vapor and clouds account for
about 98 percent of the greenhouse effect.) Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
are an exception. These are man-made gases, chiefly associated with
refrigeration, which do not occur in nature.

<P>
THE DEBATE AT UNCED

<P> Many of the delegates at UNCED will demand action to reduce the
levels of human-generated greenhouse gases on the grounds that a large
rise in the Earth's temperature would be harmful. Among the studies
generating these demands is a report to the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC). ("The Scientific Assessment of Climate Change," The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, August 1990.) This summary
concluded that global warming had already occurred, would continue to
occur, and was causing a rise in the ocean levels. (The executive
summary, however, was not representative of the body of the report,
according to 40 percent of the scientists who worked on the document,
and was termed "misleading" by half of those scientists. "Survey of
U.S. Participants in the IPCC Report," The Science and Environmental
Policy Project, August 1991.) 

<P> If an agreement to set targets and timetables for reducing man-
made greenhouse emissions is reached at the conference, the most
popular method to reduce emissions is likely to be a carbon tax. A
carbon tax is a tax placed on every ton of carbon dioxide emitted by
industry. This would encourage factory owners to reduce CO2 emissions
-- which is considered the leading human-caused greenhouse gas. 

<P> The U.S. position throughout the discussions leading up to the
conference has been that all greenhouse gases should be considered,
not just CO2. Only half of the potential warming due to human activity
would be caused by CO2, the rest would be due to the other greenhouse
gases. The U.S. position has been that the other human-generated
greenhouse gases also should be reduced if CO2 is reduced. Putting the
burden purely on CO2 disproportionately affects the emerging poor
countries and the U.S. economically. 

<P> Further, the U.S. has insisted throughout the preparatory
negotiations that specific targets and timetable not be included in
any treaty. On May 9, 1992, the U.S. position was formally adopted by
the International Negotiating Committee (INC). Nevertheless, the
negotiated language does state the general proposition that greenhouse
gases should be cut.

<P> One of the official concerns has been that the conference will
turn into an effort aimed at redistributing the wealth from richer
countries, such as the U.S., to poorer nations. Further, the U.S. and
other industrialized countries may be pressed to change the
foundations of their economic systems and lifestyles to help the less
developed countries. Indeed, Maurice Stong, General Secretary of
UNCED, claims that industrialized countries have developed and
benefitted from unsustainable patterns of production and consumption
which have produced the present dilemma, and thus, industrialized
countries primarily have the means and responsibility to change these
patterns. (Ironically, many environmental ills have not been brought
on by industrialized countries. For instance, rainforest destruction
is cited as one reason for this conference, but the policies of
Brazil, the host country, and World Bank programs are largely
responsible for the destruction. Brazil requires homesteaders to
clear-cut the land in order to gain title. Likewise, the World Bank
provided funds to build roads through the jungle to encourage
agriculture. Thus, simple policy changes have the potential to curb
much of the destruction.)

<P>
THE ORIGINS OF GLOBAL WARMING CONCERNS

<P> The theory of global warming was first put forward by Swedish
chemist Svante Arrhenius in the late 19th century. Arrhenius theorized
that the rise in CO2 emissions caused by increased coal burning during
industrialization would warm the Earth considerably. Arrhenius
predicted that a doubling of CO2 would increase the temperature by 5C.
(Svante Arrhenius, "Philosophical Transactions," 1896. Arrehenius
further states that "[t]he influence is in general greater in the
winter than in the summer, except in the case of the parts that lie
between the maximum and the pole. The influence...is in general
somewhat greater for land than ocean. On account of the nebulosity of
the southern hemisphere, the effect will be less there than in the
northern hemisphere. An increase in [CO2] will of course diminish the
difference in temperature between day and night. A very
important...secondary effect will probably remove the maximum effect
from lower parallels to the neighborhood of the poles.") The enhanced
greenhouse effect theory, or global warming, was given new life in the
1950s because the summers were hotter than usual, and was championed
by Roger Revelle, then director of Scripps Institution of
Oceanography. (Jonathan Laing, "Climate of Fear: The Greenhouse Effect
May Be Mostly Hot Air," Barron's, February 27, 1989.) 

<P>
The Ice Age Theory

<P> The 1960s and 1970s, however, were substantially cooler than
previous decades in the northern hemisphere. The global warming theory
lost favor and a new theory emerged to supplant it. Many scientists
and environmentalists then believed that in fact global warming never
had been a real threat and that the concern should be about global
cooling. Just as many supporters of the global warming theory argue
today, the culprit was said to be human economic activity -- chiefly
dust. And just as global warming predictions today are usually stated
as fact, so the coming "Ice Age" was presented to the public as fact
in the 1960s and 1970s. The only question, according to numerous
nationally recognized proponents, was not whether an Ice Age would
occur if man continued his destructive activities, but how soon it
would come and how devastating the cold would be. (For examples of
colorful and forceful quotes by nationally recognized proponents of
global cooling, see Anna Bray, "The Ice Age Cometh," Policy Review,
No. 58, Fall 1991.)

<P>
The Shift Back to Global Warming Theory

<P> The international fear about an apocalyptic Ice Age waned as
quickly as it had arisen as soon as the trend of temperatures turned
upwards again in the late 1970s. The first computer-simulated climate
model to gain attention by suggesting a warming trend, known
technically as the General Circulation Model (GCM), was first
published in 1975, and revised in 1980. This model predicted that the
Earth would warm 4C with a doubling of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

<P> The global warming theory gained enormous support after James
Hansen, a physicist and the chief of NASA's Goddard Institute for
Space Studies, testified before the U.S. Senate in June 1988 that the
full force of human-induced global warming had arrived. (Testimony
before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, June 23,
1988.) Hansen stated that "global warming is now sufficiently large
that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and
effect relationship to the greenhouse effect." (Ibid.) In support of
his conclusions, Hansen declared that 1988 would be the warmest year
on record, barring any "remarkable and improbable" cooling. This
statement was readily accepted by the press and the general population
because the previous winter had been unusually warm and the spring and
early summer were much hotter than normal. The remarkable and
improbable cooling nevertheless occurred (even as Hansen was
testifying) in the tropical Pacific Ocean. A cold front the size of
the U.S. Great Plains also settled over Siberia later in the year,
bringing average northern hemisphere temperatures downward. In fact,
despite the unusual temperatures in the summer of 1988, one out of
every six summers since 1895 has been hotter in the U.S., the most
recent being 1963. (Jonathan Laing, "For 1989, a Drought Encore?"
Barron's, February 27, 1989.) 

<P> Since his 1988 testimony, Hansen's vision of global warming has
come under increasing attack. (Hansen also testified that the observed
warming in the past century was 0.6C to 0.7C. This is 20 to 40 percent
higher than any objective trend analysis using the global records
considered most reliable. See Michaels, op. cit.) Reid Bryson, a
respected expert in climate research and Emeritus Professor of
Geography, Meteorology, and Environmental Studies at the University of
Wisconsin at Madison, dismissed the Hansen testimony as a "phenomenal
snow job" and the global warming theory as "a triumph of sociology
over science." (Laing, "Climate of Fear," op. cit.) In fact, the
theory that substantial global warming will occur is bitterly disputed
by many highly respected scientists. Global warming is not a fact. It
is a theory that is widely challenged. In a recent survey of
atmospheric physicists and meteorologists, for instance, almost all of
the scientists agreed that catastrophic global warming predictions are
unsupported by scientific evidence and that climate models showing
warming cannot be relied upon. ("Survey of U.S. Participants in the
IPCC Report," op. cit.) There are several reason why so many
scientists are uncertain about the theory.
<P>
Reason #1: The science involved in the global warming theory is 
      very complex. 

<P> Scientists generally agree on many of the fundamental concepts
behind the greenhouse theory, which is crucial to the catastrophic
global warming theory. Where they part company is in making the jump
between one theory and the other. 

<P> The reason why there can be deep disputes among scientists
investigating climate change is that climatology is perhaps one of the
most complex and uncertain of all scientific fields. It is not
possible to run controlled experiments for the whole planet in a
laboratory test tube. Climate conditions cannot be created and changed
at will, and then studied. Thus scientists are forced to use models to
predict the consequences of various influences, and to try to
disentangle the effect of one factor from a myriad of others.
Necessarily, such models attempt to include all significant variables
and exclude the insignificant ones. The problem is to decide which is
which, and if all the variables have in fact been considered.

<P> Given the inherent difficulties in the science of climatology,
it is crucial that models are continually tested against data being
collected and that scientists accept that conflicts throw their models
and theories into question. Unfortunately this does not always happen.
For example, Christopher Folland of the United Kingdom Meteorological
Office, who was one of the senior authors of the 1990
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report to the U.N. that
predicted global warming of 2.5C, recently was asked if the data
collected to date (which showed substantially different results from
those predicted by models) would alter recommendations for CO2
emission reductions. Folland responded that "the data don't matter,"
adding that "[w]e're not basing our recommendations on the data; we're
basing them upon the GCM [General Circulation Model] climate models."
(Presentation by Patrick Michaels at the National Chamber Foundation,
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, April 10, 1992.)

<P> Clinging to a model in the face of conflicting data is bad
science, and generally leads to bad policy. But the data gathering and
modeling problem is made even more difficult because of systematic
warming biases of the data on which the models are based.

<P> "Heat Island" Effect. For instance, past observations indicate a
global temperature increase of 0.5C over the last 100 years. (It
should be noted that almost all of the warming occurred more than 50
years ago, prior to the emission of more than 67 percent of
human-generated greenhouse gases. Since 1941, the temperature dropped
and then rose about 0.1C.) But questions have arisen over the
reliability of even such a basic trend, because recording stations
have been placed in areas, such as near cities, that have experienced
growing populations over the decades. The buildings and roads which
accompany an increasing urban population retain warmth from the sun.
This may have exaggerated the long-term temperature rise -- or even
suggested one where none exists. This is known as the "heat island"
effect. 

<P> Extremely accurate and more reliable temperature records do
exist -- but only since 1979. Satellite temperature readings,
according to Roy Spencer of NASA, and John Christy of the University
of Alabama, are accurate within 0.01C, because the satellites use a
different method to calculate temperature. Just as important, the
satellites are not affected by the heat island effect and the readings
cover the entire globe uniformly, unlike ground-based stations which
are clustered and sporadic. Significantly, these satellite
temperatures show that the ground-based stations records may not be
very accurate. The ground-based records show a warming in the southern
hemisphere of 0.3C over the past decade, but the highly reliable
satellite data contradict this warming trend. In fact, the satellites
show that the southern hemisphere temperatures actually dropped 0.02C.
This calls into question the wisdom of relying on questionable data
accumulated earlier this century as the basis for costly policy
changes.

<P> But even if the ground-station records were correct, the results
would squarely contradict the global warming theory, which predicts
that the northern hemisphere will warm much faster than the southern
hemisphere. Northern hemisphere temperatures have not changed
significantly. This means that global warming advocates are faced with
the prospect of pursuing their theories although the data are suspect
and do not support their assertions, or re-examining their theories in
light of new satellite data, which show no warming trend where models
predicted it should have occurred. Unfortunately they have chosen the
first course. 

<P> Reason #2: Many models use questionable or incorrect parameters.

<P> Some of the models predicting global warming have been
discovered to have included incorrect parameters. Parameters are
variables or arbitrary constants in mathematical expressions that
generally try to reflect real world conditions which restrict or
determine the outcome of the mathematical expression. Sometimes
adjusting these parameters can have bizarre results. A prime example
is the first influential GCM model, developed in 1975. This model,
devised by Sukryo Manabe and Richard Wetherald of the Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), indicated that the Earth would warm by 4C with
a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere. Unfortunately for the model, it
also predicted background temperatures (that is, the temperatures that
would occur if there had been no CO2 increase) that would have to be
5C lower than today. It is interesting to note that since the last Ice
Age was between 4C and 6C colder than today, an ice age would have
occurred if the background model was correct. To correct for this
problem, the researchers revised the level of the sun's radiation
reaching the Earth's atmosphere upward by 6 percent. But this is
equivalent to moving the earth's orbit 2 million miles closer to the
sun. (The researchers also used incorrect parameters in another
instance in the study. The original study predicted that the polar ice
caps would melt at approximately today's temperatures. In the
subsequent report, they corrected this error, but left the accelerated
warming which is the direct result of ice cap melting in the model.) 

<P> A study of Hansen's GCM computer model, which predicts
catastrophic warming by the year 2100, found that a one percent
difference in the initial conditions or parameters was enough to
create totally different predictions of global temperatures over the
last half of the period 1991-2100. (A. Tsonis, "Sensitivity of the
Global Climate System to Initial Conditions," Eos, No. 30 (July 23,
1991), p. 313.)

     <P>Other examples of questionable or incorrect parameters include:

<P> Oceans. The theory that oceans retard the warming caused by
greenhouse gases is generally accepted, and incorporated into most
newer models. Unfortunately, the magnitude of the ocean effect is
poorly understood and roughly estimated. This could introduce
significant errors into models. For instance, many researchers claim
that it takes 50 years or more for carbon emissions to affect
temperatures. Other researchers, however, concluded recently that 75
percent of the full effect of carbon dioxide emissions on sea
temperatures is experienced within ten years. (S. Manabe, K. Bryan,
and M.J. Spelman, "Transient Response of Global Ocean Atmosphere Model
to a Doubling of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide," Journal of Physical
Oceanography, Volume 20 (1990), pp. 722-749.)

<P> Clouds. The problem of determining the effect of clouds is even
more complicated, and consequently climate models often contradict
each other in the characteristics that they assign to clouds. One
theory is that as the temperature increases, because of a rise in
greenhouse gases, the relative humidity drops and fewer clouds form.
Thus, sunlight reaching the earth increases, causing more warming, or
"positive feedback." But another scientific school of thought
maintains that clouds have a cooling effect, or "negative feedback."
The cloud feedback problem is crucial to a full discussion of the
global warming issue, since the models show a range of warming from
less than 1C to as much as 5C, depending on the extent and sign
(positive or negative) of cloud feedback alone. (George C. Marshall
Institute, "Two Environmental Issues" (Washington, D.C. December
1991).)

<P> Recent studies seem to support the view of scientists who
theorize a negative feedback from clouds. James Angell, a research
meteorologist at the NOAA Air Resources Laboratory, found that between
1950 and 1988, the number of cloudy days increased by 3.5 percent.
(J.K. Angell, "Variations and Trends in Tropospheric and Stratospheric
Global Temeratures, 1958-1987," Journal of Climate, Vol. 1, No. 12
(December 1988), pp. 1296-1313. The number of cloudy days increased 2
percentage points from approximately 56 percent to 58 percent of total
days. This is a 3.5 percent increase in the number of cloudy days.) In
addition, other research finds that human-generated sulfates,
contributing to atmospheric pollution, also have the effect of
enhancing the brightness of clouds. This increases the amount of sun
radiation reflected back into space, thus cooling the earth. ("When
fossil fuel is burned, both carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide are
added to the atmosphere. The former should cause warming of the lower
atmosphere by enhancing the greenhouse effect, whereas the latter, by
producing sulphate aerosols, may cause a cooling effect. The
possibility that these two processes could offset each other was
suggestd many years ago...but during most of the intervening period,
attention has focused on the greenhouse effect...Over the next 10-30
years, it is conceivavble that the increased radiative forcing due to
SO2 concentration changes could more than offset the reductions in
radiative forcing due reduced CO2 emissions." Virginia Climate
Advisory, Volume 15, Number 1, Spring 1991, (quoting T.M.L. Wigley,
"Could Reducing Fossil-Fuel Emissions CauseGlobal Warming?" Nature,
Vol. 349 (1991), pp. 503-505.) 

<P> Many scientists have theorized that sulphate aerosols are
primarily responsible for the increase in cloud cover, but this theory
is challenged by new evidence. In the southern hemisphere, where there
are virtually no sulphate aerosols, new evidence shows that cloudiness
has increased. (Telephone interview with Patrick Michaels, State
Climatologist for the Commonwealth of Virginia, May 13, 1992.)
Contends Patrick Michaels, State Climatologist for the Commonwealth of
Virginia, this lends credence to another theory "that increased
cloudiness is one of the natural responses to a greenhouse
enhancement, and therefore, a disproportionate amount of warming
occurs at night." (Ibid.)

<P> Cooling Effect. Clouds are probably more important than
greenhouse gases in their influence on global climate change by a
factor of 4. A study by V. Ramanathan, a professor of geophysical
sciences at the University of Chicago, has shown conclusively that
clouds have a cooling net effect on the planet. (V. Ramanathan, R.D.
Cess, E.F. Harrison, P. Minnis, B.R. Barkstrom, E. Ahmad, D. Hartmann,
"Cloud-Radiative Forcing and Climate: Results from the Earth Radiation
Budget Experiment," Science, Vol. 243, January 6, 1989.) While clouds
do create some warming effect as well as a cooling effect, the cooling
effect is larger by 13.2 watts per square meter of planet surface.
(Ibid. The heating effect of clouds, caused by longwave cloud forcing
resulting from the greenhouse effect, is 31.3 watts per square meter.
The cooling effect, caused by shortwave cloud forcing resulting from
enhanced planetary albedo, is -44.5 watts per square meter.) This
cooling effect is approximately four times the expected warming from
enhanced greenhouse gases (almost 4 watts per square meter) predicted
by catastophic global warming models, according to the study.
Moreover, "[t]his cooling effect is large over the mid- and high-
latitude oceans, with values reaching -100 watts/square meter."
(Ibid.) Thus, a small increase in cloudiness could offset potential
warming from enhanced greenhouse gases.

<P> Perhaps even more important than the change in the effect of
clouds on the overall change of temperature is the effect they may
have on day-time and night-time temperatures. This is important
because the dangers often cited by alarmists are generally predicated
on the fears of rising day temperatures, which they claim will cause
drought-induced crop failures, global flooding from the melting polar
ice caps, and other catastrophes. If only night temperatures increase,
then these dangers are extremely unlikely because rising night
temperatures would not cause these problems. Alarmists rely on the
1990 IPCC report that states "there is no compelling evidence for
general reduction in the amplitude of the diurnal cycle" from
greenhouse gases. Yet this important assumption has been recently
contradicted by government scientists. A 1991 study of the U.S., the
former Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China by Thomas Karl
and other scientists of the National Climatic Data Center at NOAA have
found that night temperatures over the time periods available in each
country have increased, but day temperatures have not. This phenomenon
is found to be directly related to increased cloud cover. (T. Karl, G.
Kukla, V. Razuvayev, M. Changery, R. Quayle, R. Heim, Jr., D.
Easterling, Cong Bin Fu, "Global Warming: Evidence for Asymetric
Diurnal Temperature Change," Geophysical Research Letters, Volume 18,
No. 12 (December 1991), pp. 2252-2256.)

<P> This study concludes that either models have overpredicted day
temperature (underpredicted night temperatures) or that the slight
warming over the last century is due to "factors unrelated to an
enhanced anthropogenically-induced greenhouse effect." (Ibid.) 

<P> Solar Activity. Cycle variations in solar activity may be a much
bigger determinant of Earth temperature variations than previously had
been assumed. While not without problems, this research is extremely
promising as an alternative explanation of global temperature changes,
and -- if correct -- means that variations in man-made greenhouse gas
emissions may have little or no impact. A study by Danish scientists
E. Friis-Christensen and K. Lassen of the Danish Meteorological
Institute has gained enormous attention recently. This study, released
in November 1991, found that variations in the sunspot cycle are
correlated extremely closely with northern hemisphere temperature
fluctuations. (E. Friis-Christensen and K. Lassen, "Length of Solar
Cycle: An Indicator of Solar Activity Closely Associated with
Climate," Science (Vol. 254), November 1, 1991. Sunspots are
relatively dark spots that appear in groups on the surface of the sun.
They have approximately eleven-year cycles and are associated with
strong magnetic fields. The variations in the eleven-year cycle
correlate to increasing and decreasing temperatures over the last 130
years, according to the Danish study.)

<P> Some experts have even theorized that solar magnetic activity
may account almost completely for the changes in the Earth's
temperature in the last 130 years. (See Marshall Institute, "Global
Warming Update: Recent Scientific Findings" (Washington, D.C. 1992).)
Indeed, the remarkably close relationship seems to suggest that other
possible influences, such as greenhouse gases, could not influence
temperatures beyond a few tenths of a degree over the period. There is
further evidence that solar activity may be the dominant factor in
climate change. (For a thorough explanation, see George C. Marshall
Institute, op. cit.) For example, carbon analysis of trees, which is a
reliable indicator of levels of solar magnetic activity, indicates
that solar activity has risen and fallen significantly every 200-300
years for the last 6,000 years. Geologic evidence of the size of past
glaciers reveals that when solar activity increased in the past, as
indicated by carbon analysis, the Earth's temperatures also increased.
When solar activity decreased, temperatures decreased.

<P> Needless to say, the solar theory, like the global warming
theory, is still a theory and must be subjected to vigorous testing.
Moreover, the theory also leaves several questions unanswered.
Although the theory explains the northern hemisphere temperature
changes extremely well, for example, it fails completely to explain
temperature changes in the Southern Hemisphere. It also does not yet
adequately explain how solar radiation warms night temperatures but
not day temperatures. Nevertheless, the Danish study lends
considerable weight to the argument that much more research on climate
change is needed before fundamental changes in energy and economic
policies should be enacted. If solar activity turns out to be the
principal cause of climate change, the world would be needlessly
throwing away its wealth and enduring hardship if it sought to control
other minor factors.

<P>
WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCES OF GLOBAL WARMING?

<P> Even if it appears likely that a significant increase in global
temperatures will occur, and even if human activity is the principal
cause, there is still the question of whether any changes in global
temperature would be beneficial or detrimental. Again, the ability of
science to predict with confidence the results of a climate change is
very limited. Still, there are some indications of what might happen.
<P>
The Impact on Crops

<P> Nights may become warmer without any major change in daytime
temperatures. Historical data show that the temperature increases in
the past 100 years have all been at night, and that day temperatures
basically have remained constant. (The large increase in warming that
is often cited as having occurred in the last 100 years actually
occurred between 50 to 100 years ago, before the large increases in
CO2 emissions. Obscuring this fact often leads to the false conclusion
that the Earth has been steadily warming. In fact, it has oscillated.
The last fifty years showed very little overall warming.) This pattern
has important implications. The crop-growing season is affected most
by the timing of the last spring frost and the first fall frost. If
night temperatures increased, these frosts would occur earlier in the
spring and later in the fall, thereby extending the growing season and
boosting food production in many regions.

<P> It is widely believed that global warming would lead to droughts
while increasing the water requirements of plants. But this theory
does not stand up to scrutiny. First, droughts are not likely to
increase with global warming if the primary effect is to raise only
night-time temperatures. (Part of the confusion stems from the
improper use of a crude drought index, known as the Palmer Drought
Index, to gauge not only the level of drought that has occurred, but
to further predict the amount of drought that would occur in the
future from increases in the mean temperature. Proponents of future
drought base their predictions on the presumption that precipitation
will decrease while mean temperatures will increase. The problems with
this methodology are two-fold. There is no indication that
precipitation will decrease (past records show no change). Further,
using increased mean temperatures to estimate drought will
systematically overstate the problem or find problems where they do
not exist if the increase occurred at night. Simply stated, if
precipitation and day temperatures remained constant while night
temperatures increased, thereby raising the mean temperature, the
evaporation rate would not change very much because evaporation is
caused primarily by high day temperatures.) Second, since water
evaporation from plants mainly occurs during the day, plants would not
experience greater heat stress simply from warmer nights.

<P> The increased CO2 associated with the global warming theory may
also actually improve agricultural production. Studies conducted by
the Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service (ARS)
show that doubling the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere would
improve cotton yields by 80 percent, wheat and rice by 36 percent,
soybeans by 32 percent, and corn by 16 percent. (Laing, "Climate of
Fear," op. cit.) Increased CO2 in the atmosphere also would
significantly reduce the amount of water necessary for plants because
plants could breathe easier, thus losing less moisture through their
pores during the breathing process. 

<P> Another probable effect of global warming would be to expand the
world's agricultural belt. More of Canada and the former Soviet Union,
as well as the northern latitudes of Europe and the northern states of
America, could become more abundant producers. But lower latitudes
would not necessarily experience an equivalent fall in production. The
enhanced greenhouse, or global warming, theory predicts that future
warming will occur primarily in higher latitudes. Moreover, if warmer
nights were the main effect of global warming, this would mean higher
yields in lower latitudes that now experience frosts by extending the
growing season.

<P> Flooding. Some proponents of the global warming theory predict
worldwide flooding. The theory is that as the earth warms, the polar
ice caps will begin to melt and sea levels could rise to dangerous
levels. Some projections in the early 1980s theorized huge tidal waves
and a sea level rise of as much as 25 feet above the current sea
level. Even the more conservative models suggested a rise of two to
three feet. Projections have been revised down considerably in the
last decade, however. (The 1990 IPCC report found that the "best
estimate" predicted a sea level rise of 66cm, or just over 2 feet.)

<P> Evidence released this year suggests that even these recent
predictions may be wrong and that sea levels could even fall. A team
of Canadian and American scientists studied the geological record of
the ice caps over the last 130,000 years. (G. Miller, and A. deVernal,
"Will Greenhouse Warming Lead to Northern Hemisphere Ice Sheet
Growth," Nature, Volume 355 (1992), p. 245.) The team discovered that
as global temperatures rose, the size of the ice caps became larger.
The explanation? The Arctic and Antarctic air normally is too cold to
hold much moisture. (Marshall Institute, "Global Warming Update," op.
cit.) Consequently, the poles experience very little snowfall. But as
the temperature rises, the air becomes warm enough to hold moisture
and snow falls -- increasing the size of the polar caps and leading to
a drop in the sea level. 

<P>
THE COST OF DOING SOMETHING

<P> Many less developed countries are just beginning their slow
ascent out of poverty, thanks to their adoption of free market
economic policies favoring strong growth. These policies will bring
material prosperity and improvements in the quality of life of their
inhabitants. But rapid growth requires large amounts of inexpensive
energy, and for underdeveloped countries, this generally means burning
fossil fuels, such as oil and coal. If restrictions on the use of such
fuels are enacted, these countries will have to forego some of the
benefits of increased wealth and the associated improvements in
health.

<P> Some proponents of slower economic growth maintain that slower
growth means better environmental protection. But a Princeton study of
42 countries, released late last year, shows that air pollution is
inversely related to wealth above the $4,000 to $5,000 Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) per capita level. In other words, as a country grows
wealthier, its residents tend to be more prepared and can afford to
devote financial resources to reducing air pollution. (G.M. Grossman
and A.B. Krueger, "Environmental Impacts of a North American Free
Trade Agreement," Discussion Paper No. 158, Discussion Paper on
Economics, Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, November 1991.
It must be noted that between $0 to $4,000 GDP per capita, the amount
of air pollution increases as GDP per capita rises. Since Lesser
Developed Countries fall into this range, this provides an additional
reason to allow these countries to break past the wealth barrier as
quickly as possible, rather than slowly increasing in wealth or
remaining economically flat.) Action to improve the environment is a
characteristic of rich countries, not poor ones.

<P> Huge Costs. Although the economic impact of curbing man-made
greenhouse gas emissions would be greatest in less-developed
countries, American families also would be hard hit. One proposal is
to reduce CO2 by 20 percent by the year 2000 by imposing a carbon tax.
According to a 1991 Department of Energy report, this would cost
approximately $95 billion annually, or $1,200 for every American
household. ("Limiting Net Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the United
States," U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Environmental Analysis,
Deputy Under Secretary for Policy, Planning and Analysis, September
1991.) America currently spends approximately $125 billion annually,
or about $1,500 per family, on environmental protection. The carbon
tax proposal would almost double that cost, and might lead to demands
from business and households to reduce other spending to protect the
environment. In preparatory conference negotiations concluded this May
9, the U.S. and 142 other countries adopted non-binding vague language
that urged greenhouse emissions to be returned to their 1990 levels by
some unspecified date and to attempt unspecified reductions by the
year 2000.

<P> However, according to a 1990 study by the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO), even if emissions were kept at 1990 levels, America
would "risk several years of economic stagnation and high
unemployment," depending on how a carbon tax was implemented.
(Congressional Budget Office, "Carbon Charges as a Response to Global
Warming: The Effects of Taxing Fossil Fuels," August 1990.) Even if
the tax were phased in gradually, an estimated 700,000 jobs would be
lost as a direct result of the carbon tax by 1997, according to the
CBO. 

<P> Another report, a Department of State memorandum issued last
month, suggests the cost of reducing carbon emissions would be very
small, but this report contains doubtful assumptions. ("U.S. Views on
Global Climate Change," United States Department of State, Bureau of
Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, April
23, 1992.) For instance, the State Department memorandum assumes that
over one-quarter of all households and up to almost two-thirds of all
U.S. businesses will replace their lighting fixtures with more energy
efficient fixtures by the year 2000. This unlikely assumption accounts
for as much as 46 percent of the total voluntary carbon reductions the
State Department predicts will occur.

<P>
A PRUDENT POLICY AMID UNCERTAIN SCIENCE

<P> When faced with uncertain science, as is the case with the
theory of global warming, one of four basic strategies can be adopted.
(S. Fred Singer, "Environmental Strategies with Uncertain Science,"
Regulation, Winter 1990, p. 65.) These are: 
<UL>
<P>Option #1: Take no action, not even research. This option has the
      advantage of being costless, since it requires nothing but
      waiting until the threat, if any, is clearer. But it introduces
      the danger of not dealing with a potential problem and not
      increasing knowledge concerning the threat and the consequences
      of inaction.

<P>Option #2: Conduct more research, but take no other action. This
      option has the advantage of being relatively inexpensive
      compared with other possible actions, while increasing the
      knowledge of the scope and likelihood of a potential problem. It
      risks, of course, the consequences associated with having
      delayed action if the threat turns out to be real.
      

<P>Option #3: Take limited action to control greenhouse gas emissions,
      phased in over a period of time. This option has the advantage
      of being less expensive than tackling the problem -- if it
      exists -- completely and immediately. But it suffers from being
      much more expensive than research, and the result may be huge
      expenditures on a problem that does not exist.


<P>Option #4: Undertake full control of emissions on an emergency
      timetable. This option has the advantage of addressing potential
      harm as quickly and thoroughly as possible. But it is very
      expensive, and may address a mythical problem.
</UL>

<P> The threat posed by global warming, if it is real, is large
enough to rule out the first option as the prudent policy. Policy
makers then must consider the risk in delaying action while acquiring
more scientific understanding on which to base a policy. Two studies
completed last year strongly contradict the "must act now" view that
maintains there is no time to delay, according to a scientific panel
of the George C. Marshall Institute, which is a Washington, D.C.-based
public policy institute focusing on scientific matters. According to
the panel's findings:
<UL>
 The calculations [of both studies] show that a five-year delay
      in limiting carbon emissions will make the world warmer in the
      next century by at most one tenth of a degree, compared to how
      warm it would be if there were no delay. (Marshall Institute,
      "Global Warming Update," op. cit.)
</UL>
<P> At the same time, the research data made possible by stepped-up
global climate research means knowledge is increasing rapidly, so
delay may significantly increase the chances of taking the right
course of action without incurring serious damage to the Earth's
environment if the global warming theory is found to be substantially
correct.

<P> Thus rather than agreeing to targets and timetables for
controlling greenhouse gas emissions, which may not be needed and
which would impose enormous costs on developed and less-developed
countries, the U.S. would be wise to pursue an intensive program of
research and urge other countries to do likewise.

<P> The U.S. has set the pace in research on global change, and this
has produced huge amounts of new data -- much of it raising serious
questions about the global warming theory. The U.S. has spent $2.7
billion since the global change research project was initiated three
years ago, and the Administration has proposed increasing the annual
global change research budget next year by 24 percent to almost $1.4
billion. The rest of the world combined spends about the same amount
as the U.S. currently. The U.S. should commit to increases in the
research budget of $300 million, or 25 percent, annually for the next
five years. To pay for this research, the federal government should
sell the Naval Petroleum Reserve, which is no longer needed for the
Navy's security.

<P> The Search for an Answer. New climate change research could be
supplemented by allowing scientists greater access to non-sensitive
intelligence information accumulated in the past. This would be useful
because surveillance satellites and aircraft, submarines, and
oceanographic vessels have collected mountains of data that can be
used to accelerate research on questions such as past contours and
thaw rates of polar ice caps, ocean chemistry and temperatures, and
scores of other issues. Subject to legitimate national security
concerns, such as sources and methods of intelligence gathering and
existing programs, President Bush should announce that he will
authorize U.S. intelligence agencies to begin opening their relevant
archived files. (The authorization for opening the archives should be
limited to global research only.) Not only could this prove very
beneficial to the search for an answer to the questions implicit in
the global warming theory, but such an action would demonstrate that
the President takes the potential threat of global warming seriously
-- without prematurely engaging in a potentially harmful and costly
policy. (As Alton Frye, Vice President and Washington director of the
Council on Foreign Relations, states: "Given the pressures on the
President to join the commitments projected for the Rio conference, a
program of cooperation between environmental and national security
communities could be a political windfall for the Administration. The
President should tell the world at the Earth Summit that he has sent a
clear order to the national security community: ' subject only to
safeguarding current programs, open the archives.' Few steps would do
more to demonstrate commitment to vigorous action on the global
warming issue.... " Alton Frye, "How to 'Spy' on the Environment," The
Washington Post, May 4, 1992, p. C4.) 
<P>
CONCLUSION

<P> Climate change is an extremely complicated field of scientific
research. Although understanding of the probable effects of greenhouse
gas emissions is rapidly improving, the level of uncertainty remains
high and the predictive power of climate models is poor. The models
now used vary in their predictions enormously. 

<P> Moreover, recent studies and analyses of past studies indicate
that many of the underlying assumptions in the computer models showing
warming are wrong and lead to erroneous predictions. Models of climate
change also fail to explain the discrepancy between predicted climate
change in the last 100 years and actual change. 

<P> In addition, even if the elements of the global warming theory
are accepted, the forecasted effects are overblown and may in some
cases be completely wrong. In particular, the evidence suggests
strongly that widespread flooding from the melting of the ice caps
will not occur. Further, agricultural production is likely to
increase, not fall. 

<P> And while there is a plausible ring to the argument that it
would be wise for countries to take action, "just in case," the costs
of government-mandated reductions in CO2 would be enormous. Such
reductions would impose heavy costs on American families and raise
unemployment. Less developed countries would be especially hard hit.

<P> Thus, given the shaky science, the uncertain effects, and the
enormous cost of taking precipitous action, the U.S. should not agree
to binding targets and timetables on emissions at the Rio conference
next month. Any agreement should be limited to a commitment to treat
the threat seriously, with reductions in greenhouse gases voluntary
for each country. 

<P> What the U.S. should do is emphasize the importance of research
on global climate change. The U.S. should pledge to increase its
climate research budget, which accounts for half the total spent by
all countries, and challenge the other nations at the conference to
step up their research. The U.S. also should open up the relevant
archives of U.S. intelligence agencies, subject to legitimate national
security concerns, to accelerate global climate research.

<P> Global warming may pose a huge danger to the Earth. Or it may
turn out to be just as much a false alarm as the "Ice Age" panic
twenty years ago. If the science of climate change was more precise
than it is, and all the evidence consistent with the dire predictions
of some proponents of the global warming theory, then it could make
sense for the U.S. and other countries to take urgent, expensive
action in an effort to deal with the potential threat. But the science
is uncertain. Rather than rush to "do something," the wiser course
would be to find out what is actually happening to the Earth's
climate.

<P>INTRODUCTION

<P>      It is time for federal regulators to obey the Bill of Rights.
This is the message of the Private Property Rights Act (S. 50),
introduced in the Senate by Steve Symms, the Idaho Republican. Symms's
bill would give teeth to the Fifth Amendment's requirement that no
"private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."
Targeted by the bill is the mounting practice of government
regulations to deprive individuals and businesses of the use of their
property without compensating the owners for the loss of their
property.
<P>      The Symms bill would codify and make permanent Executive Order
12630, signed by Ronald Reagan in 1988, which requires federal
agencies to consider whether their actions might infringe on property
rights and, if they do, to seek alternative ways to achieve their
goals. The Symms bill also would give the President a legislative
weapon to use in his fight to make all federal agencies fully and
consistently put the right of property ahead of the power of
bureaucrats.

 <P>     Just Compensation. The Fifth Amendment's requirement that when
the government takes private property the government must compensate
the owner is referred to interchangeably as the "Just Compensation
Clause," the "Eminent Domain Clause," or the "Takings Clause." Thus,
if the government needs land on which to build a road, it must pay the
owner for the land. The Fifth Amendment also applies to other
infringements of property rights that fall short of total
confiscation; on these, however, the courts have upheld the right to
compensation only inconsistently. 

 <P>     In recent years property owners have found the use and enjoyment
of their property more and more restricted by regulators, often in the
name of environmental protection. Thus, for example, individuals have
bought land for houses only to be told that they are no longer allowed
to build. Farmers have bought land for farming only to be told that
they are not allowed to farm because their land must be left in its
natural state. Businesses have been told to shut down mining
operations not, as it turns out, to prevent them from polluting, but
because their mining property has been designated as a "wetland" that
must be preserved. Typically in such cases, the government has not
voluntarily compensated the owners for their losses.

 <P>     Shift in Court. Since 1987, however, the Supreme Court has
started to recognize that regulation is often used as a substitute for
the power of eminent domain: Instead of buying land outright, the
government often tries to avoid the requirement of paying compensation
by simply commanding property owners to use their land in whatever
manner the government wishes. In the face of this practice, however,
the Supreme Court has begun to hold that regulation, as much as
outright confiscation, can be subject to the constitutional
requirement of just compensation. In response to this shift in the
Supreme Court's treatment of regulatory takings, Ronald Reagan in 1988
issued Executive Order 12630, which requires federal agencies to
determine in advance if their actions may prompt a claim for
compensation. The purpose of the Order is twofold: to protect private
property owners from the inadvertent, de facto confiscation of their
property through regulation, and to control and limit the amount that
taxpayers have to pay in just compensation awards to people whose
property has been taken by federal regulation. Such awards will soon
become a major budget item. The total amount of all such outstanding
claims is over one billion dollars and growing rapidly.

 <P>     The Executive Order has been applied diligently by some
government agencies but has been resisted by others. A future
President, moreover, could rescind the order. Symms's bill would make
permanent the protection offered by the Executive Order and require
that the Attorney General certify that each agency is in compliance
with the Order's principles.

  <P>    The Symms legislation could be improved if it required that
compensation be paid out of the budget of the agency at fault in
taking private property without compensation. This would give agencies
a strong incentive to avoid unnecessary takings of the property rights
of the citizens.


<P>THE FIFTH AMENDMENT
<P>
      The federal government and the states have the power to condemn
and take over land for such public uses as roads, parks, post offices,
or military bases. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
stipulates that in such cases, which are called "takings," the owner
must be compensated for the loss of the property. As the Supreme Court
has explained, "The Fifth Amendment's guarantee that private property
shall not be taken for a public use without just compensation was
designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear
public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by
the public as a whole." (Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49
(1960).) Since the general public thus benefits, the Court has
declared, "the public at large, rather than a single owner, must bear
the burden of an exercise of state power in the public interest."
(Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 260-61 (1980).) 

  <P>    Although the Just Compensation Clause in the Fifth Amendment is
mainly concerned with land, it applies to any kind of property.
Example: If in a military emergency the government were to confiscate
airplanes or ships from private owners, or simply require that they be
turned over to the government for the duration of the emergency, the
government would have to compensate the owners.

 <P>     Government can take an interest in property short of complete
ownership, moreover, and still be required to pay compensation for
what it has taken. Thus, for example, where flights of government
aircraft over private property are so low and frequent as to
constitute a direct and immediate interference with the use and
enjoyment of the land, the government has taken a flight easement for
which it must pay damages to the landowner. (United States v. Causby,
328 U.S. 256, 267 (1946).) 
<P>
REGULATORY TAKINGS

<P>      The government also takes property rights by imposing
restrictions on the use of property. Suppose, for example, the
government wants to preserve a forest or a wetland in its natural
condition, either for recreational use or for a wildlife refuge. If
the government were to condemn the land outright, there would be no
question about its obligation to compensate the landowner. 

 <P>     Yet, suppose further that the government decides to leave legal
title to the land with its private owner and passes a regulation
prohibiting the owner from developing the land, or from farming it, or
from doing anything else that changes the land's natural state. In
this case the government would be compelling the private landowner to
devote the land to whatever use the government desires. In effect, the
government here takes away from the owner the right to use the land.
The private owner of the land would be owner in name only; the
effective owner would be the government, although in almost all
instances the private owner would still be liable for the payment of
property taxes on the land. This would be an attempt to circumvent the
Fifth Amendment and to achieve the same ends as would outright
condemnation, but without paying compensation. 

  <P>    Common Law Rights. Not all regulations, of course, infringe on
private property rights. Under the common law of property and tort, a
landowner's property rights are defined and limited by the property
rights of his neighbors. If a regulation merely prevents someone from
engaging in activities that would violate the rights of others under
the common law of nuisance or trespass, (The common law kept clear the
important distinction between inflicting a harm and withdrawing or
denying a benefit. In general, only physical invasions counted as
injuries and could give rise to a cause of action. See Richard A.
Epstein, Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain
(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1985), pp. 107-125.) such
as polluting a river that runs through a neighbors's land, then the
landowner has no right to compensation, even though the value of the
landowner's land may be diminished as a result of the prohibition.
This is because the landowner has no right to engage in such
activities to begin with. (See, e.g., Office of Legal Policy, U.S.
Department of Justice, Economic Liberties Protected by the
Constitution, March 16, 1988, pp. 7-11, 32.) Regulations in such cases
actually would protect private property rights.

  <P>    The Easement Option. By contrast, if a particular activity would
not violate the property rights of others as defined under the common
law of trespass or nuisance and would not give others any legal ground
to sue, then a landowner has the right to engage in the activity on
his or her own land. If a neighbor wants to prevent the landowner from
engaging in some activity that does not violate the neighbor's
property rights, the neighbor must pay the landowner to abstain from
the activity; and if the neighbor wants to stop the activity
permanently, he or she must purchase an easement from the landowner.
(An easement is a right over the property of another. An affirmative
easement is a right of use, such as a right of way allowing one to
pass over the land of another to access a road or a beach, or a right
to discharge water onto neighboring land. A negative easement is a
restriction on the use of land by its owner, prohibiting him from
doing something which would otherwise be lawful. A negative easement
may also be called a "restrictive covenant" or a "negative servitude."
Black's Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition (St. Paul, Minn.: West
Publishing Company, 1979), pp. 457-58, 1182, 1229.) 

  <P>    This means that any regulation that prevents people from
engaging in activities on their land that do not violate the property
rights of others abridges the property rights of the landowners whose
activities are restricted. Specifically, such a regulation takes away
some of the landowners' rights in the use and enjoyment of their land,
in effect taking an easement that should have been theirs to sell.
Even if many other desirable uses are still permitted to the
landowners, the regulation is a partial taking. As such, the
landowners deserve to be compensated for whatever property rights they
have lost. 

  <P>    Computing Compensation. Whenever a regulation takes away private
property rights, the proper measure of compensation is the difference
between the value of the property with and without the regulation;
this difference is the value of the easement the government has taken.
Of course, if the property is worth just as much with the regulation
as it is without it, then no loss in value has been caused, and no
compensation is owed. Similarly, some government actions may reduce
the value of land without taking away property rights, and hence do
not give rise to an obligation to compensate. Example: A decision to
close an exit along a particular highway, or to build a new highway
someplace else, may diminish the value of hotels and restaurants along
the original highway. If the landowners' property rights in the use of
their land have been left fully intact, however, then they are not
entitled to compensation out of taxpayer funds. 

 <P>     The mere fact that a regulation amounts to a taking does not
mean that the government cannot go forward with the planned
regulation. It simply means that the government must pay compensation
in order to do so. The only issue properly involved in regulatory
takings cases under the Fifth Amendment is the right to compensation,
not the validity of the regulations.
<P>

PROBLEMS IN THE CASE LAW

 <P>     Although the Supreme Court has recognized for at least 70 years
that regulations can constitute a taking of private property for
public use, (Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922). The
Court considered but rejected a regulatory taking claim some 35 years
earlier in Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887).) it has awarded
compensation only rarely. Often the Court found procedural or
technical reasons to avoid ruling on regulatory taking claims. In many
cases, the Court has denied compensation on the ground that the
regulation is an exercise of the "police power" of the federal
government or of the state governments, even though the Fifth
Amendment contains no "police power" exception. ( For examples of
regulations that have been upheld on "police power" grounds, see
Office of Legal Policy, op. cit., p. 35; Epstein, op. cit., pp.
112-15, 121-25, 130-34, 140-41.) 

 <P>     Police power originally referred only to government action that
sought to guard against genuine threats to health, safety, or
property. Examples of this might include zoning laws that ban toxic
waste dumps or nuclear reactors from residential areas. Over the
years, however, the term "police power" has been expanded to cover
virtually any government action. As a result, any action that is for a
public use or purpose usually constitutes an exercise of the police
power in the eyes of the court. 

 <P>     In cases in which the plaintiff seeks to invalidate a
regulation, the "police power" doctrine can be appropriate. (For
example, in Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365
(1926), the first case to uphold zoning against a constitutional
challenge, the plaintiff did not even seek just compensation under the
Fifth Amendment in his appeal before the Supreme Court (although he
had sought just compensation in the courts below), but instead merely
sought an injunction against enforcement of the zoning ordinance on
the ground that it took his property without due process of law, in
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.) But it is not appropriate in
cases where the plaintiff is merely seeking compensation. The fact
that a regulation that takes private property rights may fall within
the police power, as that power has come to be defined by the courts,
only suffices to show that the regulation is consistent with the Fifth
Amendment's requirement that takings be for public use; it cannot
eliminate the requirement that just compensation be paid. Before it
clarified matters in 1987, (See Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass'n v.
DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 491 n. 20 (1987).) the Supreme Court often
acted as though the issue before it was whether a regulation was
valid, when in fact the proper constitutional issue was whether a
constitutionally valid regulation nonetheless required payment of just
compensation. 

  <P>    Confusing the Issue. The Supreme Court also has held sometimes
that a regulation is not a taking of property unless the regulation
leaves the property owner with no remaining "economically viable use"
of his property. (E.g., Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 260
(1980); United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121,
127 (1985). Other cases have explicitly or implicitly rejected this
view. E.g., Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922);
Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982). The
Court has never specified just how remunerative a remaining use must
be in order to count as "economically viable.") This has meant that a
regulation must render the affected property essentially worthless
before the Supreme Court will recognize a taking and award
compensation. In these cases, the Court seems to have confused the
issue of whether a taking has occurred with the issue of how much
should be paid as compensation. 

  <P>    Obviously, if a regulation leaves a property owner with some
remaining "economically viable use" of his property, then the owner is
not entitled to receive the full pre-regulation value of his property
as compensation. The owner is entitled, however, to compensation for
the drop in value resulting from the regulation, regardless of whether
the property's remaining value is great or small, so long as it is
less than the pre-regulation value. There is a middle ground between
paying the full value of the affected property as compensation and
paying nothing. This middle ground consists of paying the value not of
the property in its entirety, but of the easement that de facto has
been taken.
<P>

REVERSING THE TREND

 <P>     In 1987 the Supreme Court's treatment of the Fifth Amendment's
Just Compensation Clause began to change significantly. First, the
Court made clear that the "police power" doctrine, which it often had
used to uphold the validity of statutes, does not apply to takings
claims brought under the Fifth Amendment, and hence does not
constitute an exception to the Just Compensation Clause. (See Keystone
Bituminous Coal Ass'n v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 491 n. 20
(1987).) The Court also explicitly rejected the notion that the only
remedy for a regulatory taking is invalidation of the regulation,
making clear that compensation is an appropriate remedy (When the
government formally seeks to condemn a piece of land, compelling the
owner to sell, it institutes an eminent domain proceeding. When a
landowner whose land has been invaded or restricted by government, but
who has retained legal title in his land due to the government's
failure to invoke the power of eminent domain, wishes to obtain
compensation by compelling the government to buy the land (or at least
an easement therein), he institutes an inverse condemnation
proceeding.) even for a partial or temporary taking. (First English
Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482
U.S. 304 (1987). First English dealt with a temporary taking, but the
underlying principle is equally applicable to permanent takings of
partial interests in property.) The Court further explicitly
recognized that easements are a form of partial taking of property
that can arise in the context of regulation or a permit-application
process. (Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825 (1987). In
Nollan, the Court found a taking where the California Coastal
Commission refused to grant a building permit to owners of beachfront
property unless they agreed to convey to the government an easement
for public access to the beach over their land.) Finally, the Court
explicitly rejected the notion that "economically viable use" of a
landowner's remaining property rights will always necessarily bar an
award of just compensation for an easement that was taken. (Nollan,
483 U.S. at 830, 834-37. See also Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan
CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982). Both of these cases involved
regulatory actions requiring landowners to submit to physical
invasions of their land or buildings by others. However, the principle
of providing partial compensation for a partial taking should apply
regardless of the nature of the easement taken.) 

 <P>     These rulings all made it easier for landowners whose property
rights are taken by regulation to obtain just compensation, prompting
an attorney with the Congressional Research Service to proclaim the
emergence of "a court trend supporting increased protection of private
property against government controls." (137 Cong. Rec. S684 (daily
edition, January 14, 1991) (statement of Senator Symms) (the
identities of the CRS attorney and the publication quoted are not
provided).) 

 <P>     This trend appears likely to continue. The Supreme Court late
last year agreed to hear two cases that will give it an opportunity to
strengthen Fifth Amendment protections of private property. (The Court
heard oral arguments in both cases earlier this year.) The more widely
publicized of the two involves a South Carolina law that prohibits new
building on oceanfront property. (Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal
Council, 112 S. Ct. 436 (cert. granted Nov. 18, 1991) (No. 91-453).)
In this case, a man had bought two beachfront lots in 1986 for a total
of $975,000, planning to build a house for his family on one lot and
to build a house to sell on the other lot. Two years later, South
Carolina passed a law prohibiting new building near the beach. This
law has prevented the man from building a house on his land -- even
though such a house would pose no threat to his neighbors and would be
no closer to the beach than many other nearby lots in the same
development, including those on either side of his, that were built
before the 1988 law was passed. As a result of the law, the two lots
have been rendered virtually worthless.

 <P>     The fact that the Supreme Court has accepted the two cases leads
many observers to predict that the Court will reinvigorate the
constitutional right to just compensation. (The other Fifth Amendment
just compensation case that the Court has agreed to hear involves a
challenge by the owner of a mobile-home park in Escondido, California
to a local rent control ordinance. Yee v. City of Escondido, 112 S.
Ct. 294 (cert. granted October 15, 1991) (No. 90-1947).)

  <P>    Substantial Awards. The trend toward granting compensation for
regulatory takings also has been reflected in the United States Claims
Court, the special federal court in Washington, D.C., that hears all
just compensation claims against the federal government. In 1990, for
example, for the first time ever, the Claims Court held that two
landowners who had been denied permits under the federal Clean Water
Act to use their land in various ways because the government had
classified the land as a "wetland" were entitled to just compensation
because the government failed to prove that the substances that would
have been discharged into the wetlands would have lowered water
quality. (In the vast majority of cases under the Clean Water Act, the
decision to deny a landowner a permit to fill in a wetland has nothing
to do with any polluting properties of the substance that would be
used to fill the wetland; often this substance consists simply of dirt
taken from one part of the wetland and deposited onto another. See
William G. Laffer III, "Protecting Ecologically Valuable Wetlands
without Destroying Property Rights," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder
No. 840, July 15, 1991.) The Claims Court awarded the respective
landowners over $1 million dollars in one case (Florida Rock
Industries v. United States, 21 Cl. Ct. 161 (1990) (involving the
mining of limestone). This case is now on appeal before the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.) and over $2.6 million in another,
(Loveladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, 21 Cl. Ct. 153 (1990)
(involving the building of houses). This case is now on appeal before
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.) specifically
basing its decisions on the distinction between tortious and
nontortious uses of land. (See Florida Rock Industries, 21 Cl. Ct. at
166-68. The only damage that is done when a wetland is filled with
chemically harmless material is to the landowner's own property, the
wetland; there is no physical invasion of anyone else's land or water
such as would give rise to a common-law nuisance action. See Epstein,
op. cit., p. 123.) In each case, it was clear that the decision by the
Army Corps of Engineers to deny a permit under the Clean Water Act had
nothing to do with the prevention of water pollution, but instead was
motivated purely by a desire to preserve the wetlands in question as
wetlands. Therefore, the Corps of Engineers was really confiscating an
easement on the landowners' land, taking away some or all of their
development rights.

<P>      While these two cases are on appeal, there is evidence that
higher courts will side with property owners. In a bellwether case,
(Whitney Benefits, Inc. v. United States, 18 Cl. Ct. 394 (1989),
modified, 20 Cl. Ct. 324 (1990), aff'd, 926 F.2d 1169 (Fed. Cir.),
cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 406 (1991).) the Claims Court in 1989 awarded
over $150 million to a company that had been prohibited by the
Department of the Interior from mining coal on its own land. The Court
of Appeals last year affirmed the decision, and the Supreme Court
declined to take the government's appeal, thereby allowing the lower
court decisions to stand. The Supreme Court's decision not to review
the lower courts' rulings in this case is widely viewed as solid
evidence that it will decide the cases currently before it in favor of
justly compensating the landowners. (See, e.g., Moore, "Showdown on
Property Rights," National Journal, November 30, 1991, p. 2940;
"Environment Laws Face a Stiff Test from Landowners," The New York
Times, January 20, 1992, p. A1.)

<P>
PAYING FOR REGULATORY TAKINGS

 <P>     The increased ability of property owners to secure just
compensation when their property rights are taken by regulations means
that the government, and hence the taxpayers, can expect to pay more
in coming years for actions that restrict property rights. As a
consequence of the court rulings of the past five years, and of the
explosive growth in regulation over the past twenty years, the number
of takings claims filed against the government, the frequency with
which property owners seeking just compensation win, and the average
dollar amount awarded to successful claimants all have increased.
<P><UL><UL>
      Consider the following:
<P>
      52 cases alleging the taking of property and seeking
      compensation were filed with the Claims Court last year, the
      most in at least a decade, and possibly the most ever. ( Ibid.)
<P>
      Nearly 200 takings cases are pending in the Claims Court. (Ibid.
      ) The total compensation that the U.S. would have to pay if
      those seeking redress were to win and receive the full amount
      that they are seeking is well over $1 billion.</UL></UL>
<P>
      Although the United States surely will win and thereby avoid
paying compensation in many of these cases, the frequency with which
property owners seeking just compensation win has risen sharply in
recent years. Property owners won more than half of all regulatory
taking cases decided by the federal courts in 1990, the most recent
year for which figures are available. In contrast, the federal
government wins nine out of ten times in other areas of the law.

 <P>     The growth in federal regulation in the past three years, and
the trend in the courts toward protecting private property owners,
means that the government can expect to pay more in the future to
compensate for regulatory takings.

<P>
EXECUTIVE ORDER 12630

 <P>     On March 15, 1988, in response to the Supreme Court's 1987
takings decisions and the perceived increase in the likelihood of the
federal government having to pay increased just compensation awards,
Ronald Reagan issued an Executive Order dealing with "Government
Actions and Interference With Constitutionally Protected Property
Rights." (Exec. Order No. 12630, 53 Fed. Reg. 8859 (March 18, 1988).)
This detailed Executive Order basically requires each department or
agency in the Executive Branch:
<P><UL><UL>
      to consider in advance whether any contemplated action might,
      under the Supreme Court's case law as it stands at the time of
      the agency's or department's determination, be a taking of
      private property, and hence lead to an eventual judgment against
      the U.S. that must be paid by the Treasury;
<P>
      to estimate the potential cost to the federal government of any
      contemplated action regulating the use of private property, in
      the event that a court later determines that the action
      constituted a taking;
<P>
      to look for alternatives that would achieve the same ends but
      would not involve takings or would impose less on private
      property;
<P>
      to decide in advance whether a particular action that may result
      in a taking is worth what it is likely to cost; and 
<P>
      to set regulatory priorities.</UL></UL>
<P>
      The Executive Order also gives the departments and agencies
detailed and specific instructions on how to minimize the burdens
imposed on private property and the resulting liabilities imposed on
the Treasury. These instructions include: 
<P><UL><UL>
      avoiding undue delays in granting or denying permits, and in
      making other decisions affecting private property;
<P>
      ensuring that permits are granted or denied based on the same
      standard; (This requirement has been violated often in the past.
      The Army Corps of Engineers, for example, routinely abuses its
      enforcement authority under the Clean Water Act, which is purely
      an anti-pollution statute, by granting permits for discharges of
      materials that pose no threat to water quality only on the
      condition that the landowner set aside land for wildlife
      protection at his own expense.)
<P>
      ensuring that restrictions imposed on the use of private
      property are not disproportionate to the contribution of the
      restricted uses to the overall problem that the restrictions are
      imposed to redress.</UL></UL>
<P>
      The purpose of all these measures is to avoid taking private
property inadvertently, and thereby to avoid incurring unanticipated
costs to the taxpayers.

 <P>     Executive Order 12630 does not add to or alter the Fifth
Amendment's requirement that just compensation be paid, the
probability that those landowners whose property is taken will be
paid, or the amount that they will recover if they are paid. It simply
requires Executive Branch agencies and departments to anticipate the
potential fiscal consequences of their actions. 

 <P>     Given the recent changes in the Supreme Court's standards for
awarding just compensation, if federal officials fail to conduct such
an inquiry before acting, they run a significant risk that the federal
government will get stuck with an unexpected bill several years later.
This also would mean that the government could end up being compelled
to pay for properties that it would not have chosen to buy if it had
thought about its priorities in advance. Thus, the Executive Order is
really just a "look before you leap" provision designed primarily to
protect the taxpayers. It mainly is a budgetary tool -- a device for
controlling spending.
<P>
      Paying Costs of Regulation. Yet, the Executive Order also
protects property owners. Since regulators will be forced to refrain
from taking actions that they cannot afford to pay for, many
regulatory takings of private property will be deterred. Regulators no
longer will be able to treat private property as a free good, usable
without limit and without cost. Instead they will have to decide how
much regulation they can afford. 

 <P>     Thus, even though the Executive Order does not affect the
ability of those whose property is taken to obtain compensation, it
will still protect landowners. After all, landowners who have their
property taken without their consent and who receive court-determined
compensation almost always would prefer to forego the compensation and
keep their land. (Presumably even then they would still be entitled to
receive compensation for any temporary taking that had occurred.)
There are two reasons why this is so. First, if the compensation
provided were worth as much in the eyes of the landowner as the
property taken, the landowner would sell voluntarily, and the
government would gain nothing by taking rather than buying. Second,
compensation is risky and uncertain, and difficult and expensive to
seek and obtain. (However, under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and
Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, 42 U.S.C. 4654(c),
those who succeed in obtaining an award of compensation for the taking
of property by a federal agency also receive, as part of their award,
reimbursement for any "reasonable costs, disbursements, and expenses,
including reasonable attorney, appraisal, and engineering fees," that
they are forced to incur in order to obtain their compensation from
the government.) Therefore, although court-determined compensation is
better than nothing, landowners generally would be better off if their
land had not been taken in the first place.
<P>
BEYOND THE EXECUTIVE ORDER: THE NEED FOR A STATUTE
<P>
      Although the Executive Order is a major step toward protecting
private property rights, it lacks the force of law. Officers and
employees of the Executive Branch have no statutory obligation to
comply with the order. Any President, moreover, may rescind the order
at any time. Explains Senator Malcolm Wallop, the Wyoming Republican:
<P><UL><UL>
      But the order is not without shortcomings. It has no teeth.
      Without the possibility of judicial review or the
      requirement of disclosure, the executive branch can ignore
      the order with impunity. Moreover, as with all executive
      orders, it can be withdrawn on a whim. (136 Cong. Rec.
      S10917 (daily edition, July 27, 1990) (statement of Senator
      Wallop).)</UL></UL>

  <P>    To date, some parts of the Executive Branch have been more
diligent and enthusiastic in complying with the Executive Order than
others. Regulators in the EPA, for example, have resisted the
Executive Order because they view it as a threat to their ability to
regulate. (Specifically, the EPA opposed adoption of the Executive
Order, attempted to soften its requirements as much as possible,
attempted to soften the guidelines for implementing the Executive
Order, and actively lobbied against legislation aimed at reinforcing
the Executive Order until the Administration had officially endorsed
the legislation.) In practice, the easiest way to circumvent the
Executive Order is routinely to find "no takings implications" when
performing the "Takings Implication Assessment" required by the
Attorney General's guidelines for implementing the Executive Order.
Existing Supreme Court and lower court precedents are sufficiently
open-ended to allow such a conclusion to be reached in many instances
without an obvious breach of good faith. The Executive Order,
meanwhile, does not limit the government's ability to regulate. The
Takings Clause and the Executive Order allow regulation, but merely
require that it be budgeted before the fact, in the case of the
Executive Order, and paid for after the fact, in the case of Takings
Clause. 

 <P>     To strengthen the Executive Order and give it the force of law,
Senator Symms introduced his Private Property Rights Act, S. 50. The
Bush Administration strongly supports S. 50, and the Senate approved
the bill last year. The House of Representatives, however, has not yet
even considered the measure. The proposed legislation states that:
<P> <UL><UL>
      No regulation promulgated after the date of enactment of
      this Act by any agency shall become effective until the
      issuing agency is certified by the Attorney General to be
      in compliance with Executive Order 12630 or similar
      procedures to assess the potential for the taking of
      private property in the course of Federal regulatory
      activity, with the goal of minimizing such taking where
      possible. (S. 50, 102nd Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1991).)</UL></UL>
<P> 
This language would prevent any new regulation from taking
effect unless the agency issuing the regulation:
<P> <UL><UL>
1)    has adopted procedures for assessing the potential impact of its
      regulatory activity on private property, as required by the
      Executive Order; and 

2)    has had its compliance with the applicable procedures certified
      by the Attorney General.</UL></UL>

 <P>      Not only would the Symms bill force the bureaucracies to take
the Executive Order more seriously by putting conditions on their
ability to regulate, but it would make permanent the protection
afforded to private property by the Executive Order. Executive
departments and agencies would not be able to regulate until the
Attorney General had certified their compliance with the applicable
procedures for assessing the impact of regulatory activity on private
property. And the Attorney General cannot certify such compliance if
such procedures do not exist. Therefore, no subsequent President could
rescind the Executive Order without replacing it with something
equivalent. 

<P>       By making the bureaucrats' ability to regulate conditional upon
their compliance with the Executive Order, or with any similar
procedures that might be adopted in the future, the legislation
proposed by Senator Symms would give regulators an incentive to
respect private property rights.

 <P>      Holding Agencies Accountable. The Symms bill, however, goes only
part way in defending the Fifth Amendment. To prompt regulators to
take the greatest care when regulating property, for example, a bill
could require all just compensation awards to come out of the budget
of the agency or department that had imposed the regulations.
Currently all such judgments come out of a "Judgment Fund"
appropriated separately from any individual agency's or department's
budget. The Executive Order requires the Office of Management and
Budget to "take action to ensure that all takings awards levied
against agencies are properly accounted for in agency budget
submissions." But this requirement is not binding on Congress and may
be repealed by the President at any time. Last year the Bush
Administration proposed legislation that would require agencies and
departments to reimburse the Judgment Fund out of their individual
budgets, but not Representative or Senator has yet introduced the
Administration's bill.
<P> 
CONCLUSION

 <P>      A fundamental goal of government is to protect the property of
its citizens. Each American correctly considers it her or his
birthright to be free to acquire land on which to build a home or to
use however she or he sees fit, so long as this use does not interfere
physically with the rights of neighbors. Businesses acquire land for
productive use, providing goods, services and jobs for Americans.

 <P>      Reducing the Regulatory Burden. When the government takes or
restricts the use of property for some public good, it must compensate
the owner. This is stated plainly in the Fifth Amendment. Without this
compensation, the government ceases being the protector of property
and instead becomes its violator. In America, based as it is on
individual rights and private enterprise, the government should go out
of its way to assure that property rights are strictly protected. The
Symms bill will make certain that property owners are compensated for
government restrictions or takings of their property. And it will help
stem the growth of regulations that not only affect individuals but
impose a heavy burden on a currently staggering economy as well.

<h3><i>HOW TO SALVAGE AGRICULTURE REFORMS IN BUDGET RECONCILIATION</i></h3>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
As conferees work to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of budget reconciliation, they will determine whether any real agriculture reform will occur this year. Only the House has included fundamental reforms of some of the existing farm programs -- changes in the wheat, feed grain, cotton, rice, and dairy programs embodied in House Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts's Freedom to Farm Act (H.R. 2195).<sup>1</sup>  Unfortunately, neither the House nor the Senate has offered any significant reform of the sugar or peanut programs or the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). If Congress is serious about accomplishing anything close to real reform this year, it should adopt the House proposals. In addition, when Congress considers the farm bill either later this year or in 1996, those programs that were overlooked in reconciliation must be addressed.<sup>2</sup>
<p>

<b>COMPARING THE HOUSE AND SENATE AGRICULTURE PROVISIONS</b>
<p>
The only meaningful reforms of agriculture programs still being considered as a part of budget reconciliation are the Freedom to Farm Act provisions included by the House (Table 1 presents a comparison of the key agriculture provisions in the House and Senate reconciliation bills). These reforms would replace traditional payments for wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice with transitional payments that decline over a period of seven years. The House eliminates the deficiency payments based upon target prices, ending the federal government's role in telling farmers what and how much to produce. The House also eliminates the marketing loan payments and the three-entity rule, which would end the preferential treatment for cotton and rice and close the payment limitation loophole that allows these farmers to receive as much as $250,000 annually. In addition, the House bill provides similar reform of the dairy program, eliminating price supports and marketing orders and replacing them with transition payments. 
<p>
The Senate failed to include any reform of these programs, other than elimination of annual acreage reduction programs and the farmer-owned reserve, reforms also embodied in the House reconciliation package. The conferees should accept the reforms provided in the House version. Otherwise, there would be no meaningful reform of the current agriculture programs, and America's farmers will be denied the chance to capitalize upon the opportunities a free market provides.
<p>
In fact, the Senate would move away from real, free-market reform of the dairy program by establishing a "Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact" that provides a competitive advantage to dairy producers in six states.<sup>3</sup>  Under the Compact, a governing commission would set a minimum price for all milk produced in the Northeast region above the price set by milk marketing orders. Producers and processors from outside this region will be precluded from competing in these six states because no milk from outside the compact states will be allowed to come in at a lower price. This not only will increase prices to consumers in the Northeast, but also will create potentially costly surpluses that must be purchased by the American taxpayer. 
<p>
Even worse, the Senate bill establishes a two-tiered pricing system by requiring compensatory payments for nonfat dry milk used in higher value products. Allowing a lower price for nonfat dry milk being exported while setting a higher price for U.S. dairy and food manufacturers using nonfat dry milk in their products amounts to imposing a "powder tax" on domestic manufacturers who use nonfat dried milk as an ingredient. The Senate bill also establishes a mechanism for national pooling of milk prices by requiring milk producers in most areas of the country to pay into a "pool" to subsidize lower prices received for surplus milk products from other areas. The Senate provisions, rather than provide reform as in the House version, takes an already archaic system of milk pricing under the Federal Milk Marketing Orders and imposes more unnecessary federal regulation on the dairy industry.
<p>
The only positive provision in the Senate version, which is absent from the House version, provides that farm program authorities expire at the end of seven years. The House bill would establish the Commission on 21st Century Production Agriculture, ostensibly for the purpose of identifying the appropriate future relationship between the federal government and production agriculture after 2002. This proposal simply represents a delaying tactic. There is ample evidence pointing to the advantages of getting the federal government out of the business of centrally managing U.S. agriculture.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
Finally, both the House and Senate failed to include any meaningful reform of the sugar or peanut programs because reform advocates were virtually frozen out of any opportunity to offer amendments that would have reformed these archaic programs. They also failed to effect significant reform of the Conservation Reserve Program, which removes millions of sustainable acres from productive use. These programs should be addressed in the farm bill. 
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
House and Senate agriculture conferees for budget reconciliation should adopt many of the reforms embodied in the House reconciliation bill. These proposals would begin to free America's farmers to produce for the world marketplace rather than for the dictates of the federal bureaucracy. These include provisions which provide significant reform of the wheat, feed grain, cotton, rice, and dairy programs. The benefits are increased farm income and greater economic growth. Conferees must reject most of the Senate provisions, which, at best, preserve the status quo and, for dairy in particular, actually make the programs more restrictive and uncompetitive. Finally, in other program areas, such as peanuts, sugar, and the Conservation Reserve Program, little or no reform is accomplished in either the House or Senate versions of reconciliation. Therefore, Congress must address the reform of these programs in the farm bill.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The 104th Congress has a rare opportunity to reform American agricultural policy and provide a huge boost to the U.S. economy. The current system of centrally planned commodity support programs, export subsidies, supply controls, acreage allotments, production quotas, and restrictions on trade imports holds back American farmers. This makes it impossible for them to benefit from the growing world market and denies farming-related industries the economic boost of higher farm production.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Freeing the U.S. farm economy -- farmers and related businesses -- to take full advantage of the growing global market would mean huge economic benefits for Americans. An analysis by Heritage Senior Fellow David Winston and Research Analysts Rea Hederman and Christine L. Olson indicates that such reform would generate as much as $135 billion in new economic activity over ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In <I>Freeing America's Farmers:  The Heritage Plan for Rural Prosperity</I>, The Heritage Foundation has proposed that Congress immediately end all supply control programs.<sup>1</sup> The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which is more a supply control than conservation program, harms the rural economy more than all other supply control programs combined because it keeps about 36 million acres out of production. The Heritage plan would reform the CRP immediately by neither renewing expiring contracts nor entering into any new ones. Farmers with existing contracts would be given the option to withdraw from the program before their contract expiration date. In return, they would receive 33 percent of the payment to which they otherwise would have been entitled for the duration of their contract.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two legislative proposals before Congress:  the Farm Freedom Act (H.R. 2010), sponsored by Representatives Richard Zimmer (R-NJ) and Charles Schumer (D-NY), and the Freedom to Farm Act (H.R. 2195), sponsored by House Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS), would end the use of annual supply controls for the wheat, feed grain, cotton, and rice programs. However, neither addresses the fundamental CRP problem. Only proposals that remove the federal government from the business of managing supply and demand can increase farm income from the marketplace while stimulating overall economic growth.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If farmers were free of the controls that now restrict output, they would enjoy a surge in new income even when modest declines in prices are taken into account. The comprehensive model of the agriculture economy developed by The Heritage Foundation indicates that additional net farm income from the marketplace in 1996 would exceed $2 billion. By the year 2001, it would be nearly $4 billion, and between 1996 and 2001, it would exceed $18 billion. The state-by-state impact on farm income of the Heritage Foundation's agriculture reform proposal can be found in <I>Freeing America's Farmers</I>.
<p><b>

HOW INCREASED FARM INCOME WILL PRODUCE AN ECONOMIC BOOM FOR STATES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Although some states would not immediately make dramatic farm income gains or would take longer to become net farm income winners, farmers in most states would gain significantly under the Heritage plan.<sup>2</sup> But an increase in farm production also has an economic impact on farm-related business. Freeing U.S. farmers would bring millions of previously idle acres back into productive use. This would require increased use of agricultural inputs, such as seed, fertilizer, and equipment, in addition to expansion of the food processing industry and greater demand for packaging, transportation, and shipping.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The appendix presents state-level data for 1996-2005 to show the value of the additional economic activity that would be generated by changes in farm income under the Heritage agriculture reform proposal. In this ten-year period, the overall economy would expand by $134.9 billion, with every state sharing in the economic expansion. Even some states that are not major agricultural producers would enjoy a boost because they supply farmers elsewhere or handle farm products. In fact, the national economy would grow by $10.9 billion in just the first year. And states benefit because they have business activity related to the farm economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Example:  Kansas and Texas each would enjoy a $1 billion boost to the economy in the first year, and Iowa would benefit by almost $800 million. States with significant agricultural production, such as Kansas (a large wheat producer), Iowa (a leading corn producer), or Texas (a large state producing many crops), reap the greatest economic benefits because most of the increased economic activity would remain in the state in which the additional farm income is generated.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Example:  Even non-agriculture states reap sizable economic benefits. Because the Heritage analysis assumes that as much as 75 percent of the new production would go to the export market, a number of states with significant export facilities but minimal agricultural production would receive large economic benefits. For instance, although a state like Rhode Island does not produce a great quantity of agricultural product, its economy would benefit from increased shipping and transportation activities, especially those related to exports. In fact, any state with significant export activities or port facilities, such as Louisiana and a number of other coastal and Great Lakes states, would derive more in benefits than they have contributed through increased agricultural production.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Also, a major share of the increased agricultural production would mean new business for firms engaged in processing, converting raw agricultural commodities into value-added products for both export and domestic use, and livestock production. Therefore, any state with a significant livestock industry or food processing facilities also would gain more than it generates simply through increased agricultural production. 

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In the next few weeks, Congress will consider the 1995 farm bill, probably as a part of budget reconciliation. Congress must take advantage of this compelling opportunity to effect fundamental reforms in U.S. agricultural policy. If the 1995 farm bill eliminates supply controls such as acreage reduction programs, ends the government's role in manipulating supply and demand through subsidies, and phases out the CRP, not only will farm income increase significantly, but the national economy will expand by over $135 billion over the next ten years. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 Some Members of Congress have advocated proposals that would do nothing more than protect the status quo and thus would fail to capture any of these potential gains. On the other hand, two proposals, H.R. 2010 and H.R. 2195, do eliminate some of the supply control programs, which would benefit farmers and related businesses. However, unless Congress enacts complete reform, including termination of the CRP, the U.S. economy will be denied the growth that can be achieved only with an end to central planning in agriculture. 

<p>
<b>APPENDIX:  THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION MODEL</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage Foundation Farm Income Projection Model, described in detail in <I>Freeing America's Farmers</I>, projects what would happen to future farm income (1996-2005) should just over three-quarters of all idled land come back into production, based on a historical analysis of the farm sector from 1990-1993. In our model we assumed that overall, about 80 percent of government-idled land would come back into production. These additional acres would yield only 95 percent as much as land currently being farmed, and costs of production would be 5 percent higher. For all cropland in our analysis, yields would increase 0.5 percent each through 2005 due to productivity gains. Finally, we assumed that because of growing overseas demand, the increase in supply would have a minimal impact on prices. The greatest effect would be in 1996, when prices would drop 4 percent. By 2005 this loss would be more than recouped.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In keeping with estimates of the gain in farm income contained in <I>Freeing America's Farmers</I>, the Heritage Foundation's more comprehensive estimates of increased economic activity are conservative in their assumptions. In the model to estimate farm income gains, we assumed that future productivity gains would be only one half of one percent annually and estimated relatively higher costs of production for new acreage relative to existing acreage. Thus, the model significantly understated potential income gains, and our conclusions about changes in farm income presented the worst case scenario, suggesting that some states would take much longer to become net farm income winners.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some states would take longer because the model assumed that farmers would continue to grow whatever crop they previously produced or currently were producing and that production on new acreage would simply reflect their historical growing patterns, even when this would cause a loss of income. However, if allowed to produce for the marketplace rather than for the government, farmers would not use their available acreage to produce any crop that resulted in a negative income. If there is no alternative crop available to generate a net profit from production on the new acreage, the farmer's rational decision would be to leave that land idle rather than produce a crop at a loss. Therefore, our model showed income losses for farmers when, at worst, there would have been no gain.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By comparison, a study by Abel, Daft and Early estimated an expansion of $28.9 billion dollars for one year, based on ending supply controls.<sup>3</sup> However, their estimate also assumed that there was no reduction in deficiency payments, which then were credited with contributing to the overall economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In estimating the additional economic activity generated by increases in farm income, we assumed that most, though not all, of the new product will be sold overseas to meet the growing demand for food in Africa and the Pacific Rim. While it is true that increased production could trigger faster development of new consumer products and new uses for the domestic market as well as for the international market, we estimate only the increase in economic activity that would be derived from increases in exports.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Heritage analysis is based on the gross business multiplier of all agricultural exports developed by Gerald Schluter and William Edmondson of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service. Their multiplier factor is based on a recognition that "in a highly interrelated economy like that of the United States, many more people benefit from agricultural exports than just farmers and exporters and their employees."  Schluter and Edmondson specifically point to firms that provide materials and services used by farmers and others to provide the export goods as beneficiaries of increased economic activity that leads to business growth, in addition to businesses which sell consumer goods and find that their customers spend more income when trade expands.<sup>4</sup>

WHY BUDGET DEBATE MUST NOT SIDELINE AGRICULTURAL REFORM
 -- Heritage </title>

<center>
<h3><i>WHY BUDGET DEBATE MUST NOT SIDELINE AGRICULTURAL REFORM</h3></i>
<p>
By John E. Frydenlund<br>
Director, Agricultural Policy Project<br>
Executive Memorandum No. 417<br>
June 16, 1995<br>
</center><hr size=3 Width=30%>
<p>

    Conferees are working now to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of
the FY 1996 budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 67). One area they need to address more boldly is
agriculture. Decisions made during the budget process about funding for U.S. agriculture programs
will have an impact far beyond budget deficit considerations. It may be politically expedient to make
only minor modifications in farm programs, but this would be harmful to farmers in the long run.
Congress must not allow the budget process to thwart the bold reforms needed to enhance U.S.
competitiveness, increase farm income, and revitalize the rural economy. More specifically, Congress
should not make agricultural policy decisions in budget reconciliation that preclude pursuing real
reform in the 1995 farm bill.
<p>
     While the need for serious deficit reduction should spur agricultural reform, Congress resists
change. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R-NM) initially sought farm program
reductions of $35 billion-$50 billion over the next five years. However, after intense lobbying by
opponents of reform, the final Senate budget resolution reduced the planned savings to only $28
billion. In addition, a non-binding resolution limits savings from commodity programs to no more
than 20 percent of the total, so Congress must find $22.5 billion in savings from nutrition programs.
In the House budget resolution, nutrition programs must absorb more than two-thirds of the
reductions -- $21 billion -- and commodity programs less than one-third. Senate Agriculture
Committee Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN) has suggested that $15 billion in savings could be found
in the  commodity and export programs, which would be an even split with nutrition programs. 
<p>
    Being required to find significant savings in commodity programs might force Congress to
adopt real reform. However, if the budget conferees settle on a lower level of savings, perhaps only
$9 billion or less, they are likely to wind up merely tinkering with existing ineffective programs, and
the opportunity for real reform will be lost. Opponents could thwart real reform, particularly in the
House, by incorporating the farm bill into budget reconciliation and bringing it to the floor with rules
that prevent either amendments or votes on specific programs. This would prevent the rest of
Congress, particularly advocates of fundamental reform, from voting for elimination of the sugar,
peanut, and supply control programs, for example, or a much-needed phaseout of the commodity
subsidies upon which supply controls are built.
<p>
    Opponents of fundamental reform claim they are protecting the interests of America's farmers.
But central planning has worked no better in agriculture than it has anywhere else it has ever been
tried. It holds back   farmers and makes them work to satisfy bureaucrats, not consumers. Nor do
farm programs protect small family farmers:  payments go overwhelmingly to the wealthiest farmers. 
<p>
    The most absurd argument put forward by opponents is that structural reform actually would
result in budgetary costs to the government. This contention rests on two fallacies:
<p>

<b>Budget Fallacy #1:</b>  Eliminating acreage reduction programs would cost the government money.
<p>
    Eliminating acreage reduction programs would cost the government money only if the
additional acres planted were eligible to receive the current level of deficiency payments and there
were only modest reductions in the subsidy level per acre. 
<p>
    Proposals such as those advanced by The Heritage Foundation, however, would eliminate
acreage reduction programs and phase out deficiency payments. Rather than receive payments for
crops planted on this additional acreage, farmers would be free to plant whatever it made sense to
produce for the market. This proposal would save the taxpayer billions of dollars, allow farmers to
produce what they want on these additional acres, increase farm income, and stimulate the rural
economy. Under any credible analysis, eliminating acreage reduction programs increases farm
income. The new export opportunities made possible under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, among other factors, allow output to increase substantially with only a short-term weakening
of prices. The result:  revenue per farm increases.
<p>
    The static economic analyses preferred by defenders of the status quo erroneously assume that
relatively  modest increases in production result in extreme reductions in the market price, inevitably
concluding that eliminating acreage reduction increases government costs. But this ignores recent
bumper crops that did not result in lower prices, as well as evidence that there will be a rapid growth
in the future global demand for food.
<p>

<b>Budget Fallacy #2:</b>  Some programs, such as sugar, are important revenue producers. 
<p>
    By imposing duties on strictly limited imports of sugar, the federal government did indeed
raise about $3   million in the last fiscal year. Proponents of the sugar program also point to
government receipts for assessments on domestic sugar production. These amounted to only $24
million in FY 1994, while the extra costs to consumers was $1.4 billion. This is a heavy economic
price to pay for a program that gives a small cartel of sugar processors and landlords the power to
parcel out the right to grow sugar.
<p>
    For Congress to buy these fallacious arguments would be to allow the special interests to stop
reforms that would help America's farmers and rural communities. Congress has a rare opportunity
this year to demonstrate to American farmers, consumers, and taxpayers that it truly is working in
their best interests. Current commodity programs not only are expensive for taxpayers, but also hold
down farm income. Moving toward a free market would permit farmers to produce for the consumer
rather than for the government.
<p>
    A free market reform of agricultural policy would:
<p>
<ul> <li>Eliminate all authority for acreage reduction and set-aside programs;<br>

<li>Eliminate the sugar and peanut programs;<br>

<li>Phase out deficiency payments for wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice and phase out the dairy
program; and<br>

<li>Phase out the Conservation Reserve Program.</ul> 
<p>
     The 1995 farm bill is an historic opportunity to develop market-oriented reforms of
agricultural policy. The budget reconciliation process should not be used to block such reform. If
Congress allows this to happen, the U.S. share of world agriculture markets will continue to shrink,
eroding farm income and hurting rural communities. But if the 1995 farm bill eliminates government
subsidies and controls, America's farmers will be able to   outproduce and outsell the rest of the
world, with their expanded output generating a tremendous growth in farm income. This freedom to
produce will also mean a large boost to the rural economy as supply and distribution industries retool
and reinvest to meet the new demands of a larger farm economy. In fact, according to  Heritage
estimates, rural America would get a $35 billion shot in the arm, which would include an increase in
farm income of more than $14 billion over the next five years. Many communities that are dying
under today's command-and-control programs would spring back to life.1

<h3>U.S. Agricultural Policy: An Australian Perspective</h3>
<p>
Delivered June 7, 1995  by The Honorable Bob Collins,<br>
Minister for Primary Industries and Senator for the Northern Territories, Australia.
<p>
Australians who watch policy debates in the United States have been impressed by the contribution The Heritage Foundation has been making, especially since last November's congressional election and the emergence of a Republican-controlled Congress.
<p>
The recent Heritage Foundation study on U.S. agriculture policy and its recommendations for reforms in agriculture policy in the 1995 farm bill is one we applaud -- although, before starting on my main points, I might say that I don't oppose all forms of government support for agriculture. Personally, I support government contributions to agriculture research and development, and in Australia we have developed what I consider is a very effective form of R & D partnership between government and industry. Also, we have developed what I believe is an effective form of adjustment assistance to farmers, which we call our rural adjustment scheme. 
<p>
Our policy, in essence, is not to provide those forms of assistance which directly intervene in the pricing or production processes. 
<p>
Australia is a major agriculture producer and exporter which has a fundamental interest in seeing liberalization in world agriculture. We export around 80 percent of our agriculture produce, and for many commodities the figure is higher. We are the world's largest exporter of wool, meat, and sugar and a leading exporter of wheat, coarse grains, dairy products, rice, fruit and vegetables, and cotton.
<p>
You may not be aware of the large trading surplus the U.S. currently enjoys with Australia. Last year the surplus was over $7 billion -- the largest trading surplus the U.S. had with any country. The trade balance is currently running at 3:1 in your favor. 
<p>
From Australia's perspective, our trade deficit with the U.S. as a proportion of GDP or on a per capita basis is larger than the U.S. deficit with Japan, and we are all aware of the bitterness that imbalance has caused.
<p>
It is little wonder that Australian governments and farmers react with some hostility to U.S. agriculture policies which subsidize U.S. exports into markets which are of significance to Australia or erect barriers to Australian agriculture exports to the U.S. Our agriculture is  almost totally unsubsidized, and, along with New Zealand, we are the only OECD nations which can claim such status. With a vital interest in bringing about uncorrupted world markets in agriculture, Australia for many years has been a strong advocate for global agriculture policy reform. No sector of world commerce or trade suffers more government intervention or trade-distorting measures than agriculture.
<p>
At the beginning of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, Australia convened a group of 14 fair trading nations in agriculture which became known as the Cairns Group. Australia continues to chair the Cairns Group, which has become the third force in world agriculture after the U.S. and Europe. Australia and the Cairns Group welcomed the outcome in agriculture in the Uruguay Round, although we were disappointed that the final outcome was less than initial expectations. 
<p>
The Uruguay Round outcome is regarded only as a first step. Cairns Group ministers recently met in Manila and reaffirmed that the group would be active in seeking further reform in world agriculture trade. In particular, the Group will be vigilant in ensuring that there is no circumvention, either in the spirit or letter, of Uruguay Round commitments. The Group intends to monitor very closely developments in agriculture policy in major countries, including the U.S., the E.U., Japan, and Korea.
<p>
Australia and the Cairns Group believe that the 1995 farm bill is an important test of the agriculture reform process and an opportunity to develop more market-oriented agriculture reforms. We acknowledge that the U.S. farm bill is largely a domestic policy process, but countries such as Australia have a legitimate role in the debate as U.S. agriculture policies have a significant impact on world agriculture markets. 
<p>
We have been seeking to play an active and constructive role in the debate. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has published a number of studies highlighting the impact of U.S. policies on world agriculture markets and the positive   benefits that would accrue from market-oriented reforms. In fact, ABARE have just released a research monograph on U.S. agricultural policies. We intend to make the report widely available here in Washington to assist those involved in developing proposals for the farm bill.
<p>
In short, we would like to see the 1995 farm bill move in the direction of fundamental market reform and many of the more market-distorting individual commodity programs eliminated. Certainly, the 1995 farm bill should be consistent with the letter and spirit of U.S. commitments in the Uruguay Round, but I also believe that some of the lessons we have learned at home could well be applied in the 1995 farm bill. When we came to office, we were faced with the need to cut our budget deficit; this year we brought our budget back into surplus. We believe strongly that, in our own interests, we should move the whole economy towards a greater market orientation. We therefore decided to pursue a farm policy which would require our farmers to confront the realities of the world market.
<p>
Not surprisingly, many of our farmers were very fearful of this approach, especially those industries which received subsidies, such as our dairy industry, which I'll use as an illustration of the practical effects of our policies. Ten years ago, our dairy industry was on the verge of collapse, and it was widely believed that Australia would have to rely on New Zealand for supply of dairy products. Since we began the reform process, the industry as a whole has blossomed, increasing its production and profitability and doubling its exports over the last ten years. 
<p>
Our farmers are rising to the challenge of a competitive world market. They, like you in America, view the booming Asian markets as a very strong source of growth. Adjustment has taken place, and the number of dairy farmers has fallen by 30 percent. However, over the past ten years, the production of milk in Australia has increased by one third, and the volume of exports has more than doubled. Industry profits and land prices have improved considerably, and the 70 percent of farmers remaining are now contemplating a sustainable future -- provided a fair trading environment exists.
<p>
The dairy support system in the United States is a good example of why Australia has a  legitimate interest in the farm bill debate. It is a complex web of artificial mechanisms designed to support domestic prices for dairy products and is administered by thousands of bureaucrats who balance the effect of those programs. On the export side, the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) is used as a tool to draw surplus product away from the U.S.    domestic market to maintain consumer transfers to dairy farmers, estimated by ABARE at $9 billion each year (resulting in almost all dairy exports being effectively subsidized).     Expansion of the DEIP into Asia will depress prices for everyone and would have the effect of Australian dairy farmers paying for those subsidies as well.
<P>
I could give other examples from our rural sector. Since reforms were introduced, the     rural sector's volume of output has grown significantly despite a reduction in farm numbers consistent with international trends. Land values, while fluctuating, have not declined in real terms. There is no comprehensive safety net for Australian farmers. The application of sound policy principles to agriculture has benefited not only the economy generally, but   agriculture itself. 
<P>
Our efforts to create an internationally competitive agriculture sector are hampered,    however, by the continued presence of export subsidization by the U.S. and the European Union. 
<P>
While in Washington this week, I met personally with E.U. Commissioner Fischler and expressed our continuing strong concerns with E.U. subsidies. I am conscious of the concerns in the U.S. about Canadian grain subsidies, but I believe your problems with Canada should be resolved through NAFTA rather than in third markets. While we acknowledge U.S. assurances that their programs are not aimed at Australia, we are concerned by the emerging trend towards the use of subsidies as a market development tool. In particular, forthcoming announcements under the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) and the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) for 1995/96 are a matter for serious concern.
<P>
I have been leaving a strong message in Washington that EEP and DEIP not be further extended in Asia/Pacific markets. We have sensitive markets for wheat, wheat flour, barley, rice, and barley malt and dairy products in the Asia/Pacific region. The U.S. is correct in identifying these markets as key targets for growth, but the large future volumes in these markets will obviate the need for subsidized sales.
<P>
The other aspect of the bilateral relationship that still causes us concern is access for our products. Beef access has improved under the Uruguay Round with the disappearance of the meat import law. Access for Australian sugar and dairy products remains restricted, mainly because of the domestic programs for these commodities, which I have mentioned.
<P>
There are many common characteristics between U.S. and Australian farmers. Our     farming, like yours, is built on the family farm; 95 percent of Australian farms are still family-owned. We both have a lot of land under farming. Some 60 percent of Australian land is used for farming; most is range land extensively grazed by sheep and cattle. The U.S. has a smaller percentage of land under farming, but compared to much of our land, your land is highly productive, enjoying higher crop yields and better pasture.
<P>
Your farmers have an enormous domestic market and an internal transport and distribution system second to none. We have no doubt that, given the underlying strengths, U.S. agriculture would continue to expand without subsidies. Your agriculture would probably be stronger and, as a result, provide stiffer competition for us in world markets. We believe that all farmers would be better off with less government intervention. Foreign consumers, not farm exporters, are the real beneficiaries from export subsidies.
<P>
The fundamental difference I have noted between our two countries is that, in Australia, we have created an environment where our farmers farm for the market and respond to  market signals. American farmers seem to spend a lot of their time farming for government programs, so much so that much of U.S. agriculture loses sight of the product it is supposed to be selling. As a result, the U.S. entrepreneurial spirit is lost.
<P>
The EEP and DEIP were originally designed to counter E.U. subsidies in the particular markets to which they were applied. In Asia, however, the E.U. do not have a significant presence, with only an average 15 percent of the Asian dairy market, for example. Extension of the EEP and DEIP into Asia would be impossible for the U.S. to defend and would put a substantial strain on the excellent relationship which has existed between our two countries.
<P>
For this reason, the major purpose of my visit has been to attempt to ensure that the important decisions that the U.S. is to make on agriculture policy in the coming months do not undermine the good relationship between our two countries. I will be leaving here shortly to put that case to the Secretary, Dan Glickman. I hope, for both our sakes, our message is heeded.

<p>
<B><FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT></B>rop subsidies for the 400-acre farm that we rent here in northwest Missouri 
average $10,000 a year, and I've gotten in the habit of spending it all. But Pat Roberts, 
congressman from Dodge City, Kansas, and the new chairman of the House Agriculture 
Committee, assures me that I won't have to wear bib overalls with a scarlet "S" for 
"subsidy" on the front. Well, that's a relief.</P>
<P>	Roberts's sense of humor is as dry as the West Kansas wind. And this year he'll 
need it, because 1995 will see the reauthorization of the Farm Bill, the huge piece of 
legislation that will govern federal agricultural programs for the next five years. As a 
defender of the existing subsidies, Roberts may find himself as lonely as a Dodge City 
vegetarian.</P>
<P>	Several rounds of budget-cutting have pared farm programs by half, or $14 billion 
annually, since 1989. Roberts intends to protect what is left, and that may take more than 
a good sense of humor. He will have few allies. The Clinton administration has no 
interest in agriculture, except for a desire to turn the Midwest into a gigantic wetland, and 
to do whatever the poultry industry wants. Bob Dole, normally a roadblock in the way of 
farm reform, will be busy running the Senate and his presidential campaign. The new 
leadership of the House of Representatives includes Dick Armey, who looks at farm 
subsidies the way a dog looks at a bone. Richard Lugar, the chairman of the Senate 
Agriculture Committee, has opened the debate with a list of 53 questions about farm 
policy. His first one: "Should we have a farm program at all?" (Roberts likens Lugar to 
Lizzie Borden, taking 53 whacks at farmers.) Farm programs have been on the defensive 
for years, but Lugar is the first leading farm-state legislator to question their very 
existence. Roberts is circling the wagons to do what agriculture-committee chairmen have 
always done--protect the subsidies--but this time he may lose.</P>
<P>	Although I have long been a critic of farm subsidies in principle, Lugar's 
questions and the programs' unpopularity have suddenly turned a philosophical question 
into a frighteningly personal one. In addition to his 53 questions, the 54th and most 
important one is: How would I replace the $10,000 in subsidies that I receive each year?</P>
<P>	Well, for one thing, I'd grow more beans. My corn crop is directly subsidized, but 
my soybean crop isn't. So guess which crop I grow more of. Without corn subsidies, 
growing soybeans would be more profitable for us here in Westboro, and in many years 
beans are more profitable even after we receive our green government checks. But we 
consistently plant more than half our acres in corn to protect our corn base. Base is the 
number of acres planted to a subsidized crop, and is used to determine the size of 
government payments.</P>
<P>	If we plant more soybeans to take advantage of their greater profitability, we lose 
some eligibility for future corn subsidies. Fathers pass many important lessons along to 
their sons. Here in the Corn Belt, a 60-year-old lesson is: Protect your base!</P>
<P>	We could offset some of these lost subsidies by reducing our costs of production. 
Soybeans are cheaper to plant, and their yield is less dependent on timely rains. We could 
save on the expensive insecticides we have to apply to the 20 percent of our land that is in 
continuous corn.</P>
<P>	We could also save on commercial fertilizer. Soybeans "fix," or capture, nitrogen 
from the air and leave it in the soil. Some of that nitrogen is available as nutrient for the 
following year's crop. By increasing our soybean acreage, we could do with less 
fertilizer. (The two crops compete for the same acres in this region; if soybean prices 
dropped because lots of other farmers made the same decision, then corn would become 
more profitable.)</P>
<P>	Another thing we'd do without farm subsidies is grow more. In order to qualify 
for government payments, we must leave part of our farm idle. This spring, for instance, 
we will plant on only 380 of our 400 acres. We could plant those other 20 acres without 
any additional investment in tractors, or combines, or rent. Without the acreage 
limitations imposed by farm programs, we would spread our fixed costs over more acres.</P>
<P>	And perhaps most important of all, there is gumbo. Gumbo is the soil that makes 
up much of our river-bottom ground. The spring after we plant corn on gumbo, the soil 
has the consistency of well-cured concrete. There are only two solutions to this problem: 
fall plowing, which is terribly expensive, or rotation to soybeans.</P>
<P>	Without the program, we could increase our average yields through better crop 
rotation. Corn after soybeans consistently yields 10 to 20 percent more than second-year 
corn. So part of the lost subsidies would be replaced by higher yields.</P>
<P>	The largest single expense for any farmer is the cost of his land. And this is where 
the farm program has its biggest impact. The first thing farmers want to know when a 
neighbor's farm comes up for sale is the size of its crop base. Farms with a large corn 
base are eligible for higher subsidies, and so are worth more than those with a smaller 
one--another reason to protect the base. When farm subsidies diminish, the price of land 
falls. Farmers compete with one another for land.  Farm policy has the effect of 
subsidizing established farmers who own much of their land, and making it more difficult 
for younger farmers to buy or rent land to establish themselves. Farm programs are often 
touted as an attempt to save the family farm. But when the capitalized value of subsidies 
raises the costs to families who want to farm, the programs serve as a barrier to entry. Not 
surprisingly, the average age of farmers is well over 50. Cuts in farm subsidies would 
allow easier entry into farming, and less expensive transfer of farms between generations.</P>
<P>	Without subsidies, we would be freed of a number of bureaucratic burdens. This 
spring, we will have to trek to the local Consolidated Farm Services Administration office 
to receive approval for our crop plan. After all of our crops are planted, we must return to 
certify that we did what we said we would. Government planes fly over our farm to take 
photographs and make sure that our corn plantings are within the limits. (Since we 
farmers don't have antiaircraft batteries, the USDA needn't resort to spy satellites.) We 
also have to file conservation plans and plan our crop rotations years in advance.</P>
<P>	How much of the $10,000 that I've become so attached to would be replaced if I 
could farm without all these constraints? I don't know. If full-scale production led to 
huge surpluses, and crop prices fell to extremely low levels and stayed there, then I would 
suffer a great deal. But without the guarantee of protection from Uncle Sam, surpluses 
might not be as much of a problem as in the past. Loan rates (the floor under the market 
price) were set above the cost of production in the 1980 farm bill, and huge surpluses 
were the result.</P> 
<P>	But sometimes we learn from our mistakes: Since 1990, loan rates have been 
below market-clearing levels. Record harvests in 1992 and 1994 have not produced a 
huge carry-over of grain. In fact, prices are slightly higher now than after the 1992 
harvest, even though corn production in 1994 was considerably higher. And in years of 
short supply, my profits might well rise without farm programs, because the government 
sells its grain stocks to set a ceiling on prices.</P>
<P>	Senator Lugar wants to know why some crops are subsidized and others are not. 
He also wants to know whether unsubsidized crops are consistently less profitable than 
subsidized ones. As I've pointed out, we can make as much profit on soybeans, which are 
not directly subsidized, as on corn. The greenhouses where we grow unsubsidized 
geraniums are the most profitable enterprise on my farm, and I don't have to wait for a 
government check. Cattle and hogs have no subsidy programs, yet hogs are consistently 
among the most profitable of agricultural commodities. Florida oranges receive no 
government support, while California oranges are grown under government rules that 
constrain supply and raise prices. Are Florida growers selling out and heading for 
California? I hardly think so.</P>
<P>	Any government subsidy increases costs in the subsidized industry, and any 
government-provided profits tend to be bid into the factors of production. There is little 
evidence that subsidies boost profits in the long run, and the fact that some crops are 
subsidized and others are not is an accident of history and politics.</P>
<P>	In the last two years, farmers witnessed two events that will make more difference 
in the long run than any farm bill could: the passage of GATT and of NAFTA. These 
trade agreements will raise agricultural exports and prices by large amounts. GATT will 
require the European Union to cut subsidies by 36 percent. Export subsidies for more 
than 8 million tonnes of European exports will have to be cut. American farmers are the 
low-cost producers of most of the commodities that Europe subsidizes, and we stand to 
gain most of that business.</P>
<P>	GATT is expected to raise incomes worldwide by as much as $5 trillion in the 
next 10 years. Many of those dollars will be spent to improve diets, as consumers 
worldwide boost their consumption of meat. Since the passage of NAFTA, agricultural 
exports to Mexico have risen by 22 percent, or $670 million, in the first 10 months of 
1994.</P>

<H3>New Farmers' Market</H3>
<P>	That giant sucking sound you hear emanates mainly from Midwestern grain bins, 
busily shipping corn and soybeans south of the border. When Mexico recovers from its 
peso crisis, NAFTA is expected to boost U.S. agricultural exports annually by $2.6 
billion.</P>
<P>	As trade barriers around the world fall, the number of people who can afford to 
buy what I produce is increasing. China has a middle class 100 million strong. With 22 
percent of the world's population, and an economy growing at 10 percent per year, 
China's potential as a market for food is mindboggling. As NAFTA expands to include 
Central and South America, more new markets will open. When the decline in trade 
barriers is combined with growth in worldwide incomes, U.S. farmers may well be 
entering a golden age for agriculture. And here on my farm in Westboro, I may find that 
being part of a freer world market pays better than farming for Uncle Sam.</P>
<P>	I've thought a lot about Senator Lugar's questions. I've tried to figure out how it 
would affect me financially if the answers to those questions persuade Congress to end or 
drastically reduce farm programs. And I think the answer is clear. I can survive without 
subsidies. In some years, I might even be better off. And there is one more question that 
Lugar asked that goes to the crux of the matter: "What is the rationale for transferring 
public funds from taxpayers, most of whom have moderate incomes, to all farmers, 
including those whose incomes--are substantially above--average?" Well, I don't 
know how you justify that.</P>
<P>	Recently, my brother took his 15-year-old son along with him to the local USDA 
office. One of the employees behind the counter pointed out that my nephew was the 
fourth generation of our family that she had worked with. I'm a little uncomfortable with 
being on the dole for that length of time, and I'm particularly uncomfortable knowing that 
my income and assets would qualify me as solidly middle class. The lady behind the 
counter retired shortly afterwards. I don't imagine it was the thought of another 
generation of Hursts that drove her into retirement, but I do believe that maybe four 
generations of middle-class welfare is enough.</P>
<P>	As Congress scrutinizes farm programs, it needs to keep one thing in mind. Pat 
Roberts tells the story of one of his constituents, who said, "I don't care what you do to 
me, as long as you let me know."</P>
<P>	Farmers have planned their businesses with the expectation of continued farm 
payments. Any reform of agricultural policy must keep those expectations in mind. We 
have been adjusting to lower subsidies for five years, and have made those adjustments 
fairly easily. Perhaps we should allow another five years to wind down this 60-year-old 
experiment in central planning, retire our overalls with the red "S," and let farmers do 
what we do best: produce the cheapest and most plentiful food supply the world has ever 
known.</P>

<p>
	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT></B>hen Bell Atlantic Chairman Ray Smith offered to help Congress find alternative 
sources of money to replace federal funding of public-television broadcasting, PBS 
supporters protested en masse. And when Jones Intercable--which already distributes 
adult-education courses through its Mind Extension University--offered to take over 
programming for PBS, the cries of outrage grew louder. Public broadcasting, which has 
always presented itself as an impoverished charity case throughout years of on-air beg-a-
thons, was suddenly described by PBS president Ervin Duggan as a valuable business 
enterprise that should not be "sold off for scrap."</P>
<P>	A similar contradiction surfaced when House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) first 
announced on National Empowerment Television (which receives no tax money) that 
he'd like to "zero out" federal subsidies for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
Lobbyists attacked him for wanting to "kill" public broadcasting. This same lobby 
counters criticism of its reliance on tax money by pointing out that the federal share of its 
revenue was only 14 percent of the total.</P>
<P>	The conflicting arguments of public-television advocates against the privatization 
of the industry illuminate the broad contours of the debate: Congress is now debating 
proposed cuts in appropriations for public broadcasting of 15 percent for 1996 and 30 
percent for 1997. But the issue is about more than just $285.6 million in tax money; it is 
also about the role and reach of the federal government and an elitist culture determined 
to manipulate it for its own purposes:</P>

<H3>Plenty of Money</H3>
<P>	Public broadcasters maintain that the federal share of their income is sacrosanct, 
the "seed money," and quite unlike the remaining 86 percent that comes from other 
sources. But, in fact, the federal matching formulas work precisely in the opposite 
manner. It is the non-federal money which is the "seed money" for public broadcasting, 
as anyone who has ever watched a pledge-week special will recognize. The federal 
government offers to match the amount of private funds each station succeeds in raising. 
This is the reason large urban stations with wealthy viewerships perversely receive more 
money from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting than do small, rural stations. It all 
prompts the question: Why are CPB advocates so certain the rest of their income could 
not be generated outside of federal coffers?</P>
<P>	It was a curious thing to watch this hostility to businessmen displayed by 
representatives of an institution that usually, at least in public, sings honeyed praises of 
"public-private partnership." These same elites point to the many <I>Fortune 500</I> 
corporations that enjoy enhanced prestige through their association with PBS: General 
Motors, Mobil, Exxon, GTE, New York Life, and Ford Motor Co.</P>
<P>	Indeed, private-sector benefactors who offered to raise money for the educational 
broadcasting system were described by Frank Rich, a columnist for the <I>New York Times</I>, 
not as generous philanthropists, but rather as "circling vultures." The privatization that 
had once been described as impossible is now denounced as being all too likely.</P>
<P>	The availability of private funding sources reveals that the fundamental issues are 
ideological and not financial. Proponents of federal support for public broadcasting want 
the government to be involved because they dislike private enterprise. They claim to fear 
the "trash" that a market-based broadcasting system could produce. They say they want 
to make television "safe for kids."</P>
<P>	What they dislike, however, is not poor-quality programming, but the very idea of 
the market. If it were the former, then how can PBS justify <I>Tales of the City</I>, a campy 
soap opera; <I>Tongues Untied</I>, which was both crude and lewd; Frontline's <I>Death of a 
Playboy Centerfold</I> and <I>Death of a Porn Queen</I>, subjects more suitable to tabloid 
television; and <I>Yanni: Live at the Acropolis</I>, which some might consider of doubtful 
value? Clearly such programming is not intrinsically superior to <I>A Current Affair</I> or 
<I>Inside Edition</I>. In fact, trash is not in the least offensive to the fans of public 
broadcasting--commercial trash is.</P>
<P>	In the PBS world view, exposure on public television can even elevate 
commercial television into art. Take the case of <I>I'll Fly Away</I>. A CBS drama starring Sam 
Waterston and Alfre Woodard, it did well critically, but poorly in the ratings, and was 
canceled after one season. PBS picked it up, producing one new episode and then airing a 
full season of repeats. The series depicted the effect on one family of the civil rights 
movement in the South, and flattered the sensibility of the liberal professionals who make 
up the core PBS audience. No doubt they could identify with this well-educated Southern 
family, which was manifestly superior to the backwards rednecks who made up the rest 
of the white folks in the series.</P>
<P>	The program was among the highest-rated shows ever broadcast by the network. 
If anything, the success of <I>I'll Fly Away</I> has indicated that a show by commercial 
producers was just what public broadcasting needed. But that was not what happened. 
Despite the series's appeal, no further commercial drama has appeared on the network. 
Indeed, PBS even canceled a development deal with producer Brandon Tartikoff, who 
had been president of NBC when it was at the top of the ratings.</P>
<P>	Commercial-drama producers were not welcome at PBS even after the success of 
<I>I'll Fly Away</I>, just as Bell Atlantic is not welcome as a replacement for Uncle Sam. The 
reason is simple: Public broadcasters see themselves as an aristocracy and, like aristocrats 
everywhere, they find commerce beneath them. No matter that the U.S. Constitution 
prohibits titles of nobility; public broadcasters see themselves like the Dons of 18th-
century Spain, with neither dust on their boots nor soil of commerce on their hands.</P>
<P>	The aristocratic pose of public broadcasting, and protestations of independence 
from mainstream American tastes, is curiously dependent precisely on the patronage of 
the federal government. Otherwise, the status of the enterprise is no different from that of 
any other broadcasting entity. Indeed, the aristocratic pretension even informs the refusal 
of the public-broadcasting lobby on Capitol Hill to submit CPB to the Freedom of 
Information Act. To disclose information to the American public--to mere commoners--
would be to lose stature. The mystery of the enterprise would be disturbed, and without 
the mystery, there would be little majesty.</P>
<P>	The aristocratic conceit also undergirds broadcasters' refusal to ensure, as the law 
requires, that programming is objective and balanced. The Public Broadcasting Act of 
1967 specifically calls for such balance in all matters of public controversy. This was 
necessary for the same reason Congress passed the ban on domestic dissemination of the 
Voice of America--that it would be dangerous to allow the federal government's power 
over the press to be exploited by a victorious political faction.</P> 
<P>	In 1992, after complaints of imbalance and the intercession of Senator Dole (R-
KS), Congress strengthened the statute to provide for a procedural review of 
programming and commissioning of remedial fare whenever public broadcasters violated 
standards of objectivity. Yet, after almost three years, the CPB has never admitted a 
single mistake, nor commissioned a single hour of remedial programming.</P>
<P>	A desire to wear a cloak of status and prestige is the only explanation for this 
otherwise inexplicable phenomenon. For to admit error would be to place public 
broadcasting on the same plane as the commercial press. <I>The New York Times</I> prints 
corrections every single day. The <I>Washington Post</I> has an ombudsman. When NBC was 
caught rigging a crash test on Dateline NBC, the company fired the president of NBC 
News. But when PBS aired the fraudulent <I>Liberators</I>, which falsely gave credit for the 
liberation of Buchenwald to African-American troops instead of the 6th Armored 
Division, WNET in New York retracted it after substantial public pressure from Jewish 
groups and World War II veterans. Yet not a single head rolled, and no corrective 
programming was aired.</P>
<P>	The aristocratic conception of status also thrives in the relation of CPB to 
Congress. Although dependent on the federal government for its annual appropriation, 
the CPB regards its role as a "heat shield" against Congressional critics rather than a 
regulator. That is, public broadcasting must be permitted to receive federal funds and 
commission programming with no questions asked. The government-weary electorate 
demands accountability for tax money spent on every other government program. Yet 
public broadcasters stand with the National Endowment for the Arts as one of the few 
recipients who claim a special exemption.</P>

<H3>Kids as Shields</H3>
<P>	PBS's attitude is bad enough when it is programming for the "new class" of 
professionals and educators. But it is even worse when it hides behind supposed concern 
for the sensibilities of children. Commercials, one of the engines of revenue, are deemed 
hazardous by a cadre of "experts" in education and media, who need to certify shows as 
"educational."</P>
<P>	But here's the rub: When advertising aimed at children became increasingly 
restricted on the networks, PBS became the venue for licensing bonanzas connected to its 
shows. For example, over 5,000 products connected to Sesame Street are grossing almost 
$1 billion in annual sales. Yet the show is nevertheless considered "non-commercial" 
because it is certified as such by "experts" in educational psychology, such as Gerald 
Lesser, a founder of Children's Television Workshop (which created <I>Sesame Street</I>) and 
a professor at Harvard University's School of Education.</P> 	
<P>	PBS executives try to have it both ways. On the one hand, they shun commercial 
television because of its commercializing influence on children. On the other hand, those 
with the franchises for PBS shows enjoy exclusive advantages no other toy vendors can 
claim--for they carry the noble title, "educational," and the PBS seal.</P>

<H3>Big-Bucks Programming</H3>
<P>	In public broadcasting, the democratic institution of Congress, which is 
responsible to the taxpayer, relinquishes the power to approve programs to an unelected 
bureaucracy. In deciding who gets grants, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has 
depended on judgments from expert panels of industry insiders, rather than the board of 
directors appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Again, the principle is 
clear: CPB should be accountable neither to the marketplace nor to the taxpayers and 
their representatives.</P>
<P>	In fiscal year 1993, CPB distributed some $289.4 million to 200 affiliated 
television stations and 490 affiliated radio stations. That was about 14 percent of the 
total--about $2 billion--spent on public radio and television. By way of comparison, in 
fiscal year 1993, CBS was the number-one rated television network in the country, with a 
prime-time Nielsen rating of 14.0, and earned broadcasting revenues of about $2.3 
billion. At that time, public television stations spent about $1.2 billion for an average 
prime time rating of under 2.5. In other words, CBS was paying $164 million for every 
ratings point in 1993, while PBS was paying about $480 million per ratings point.</P> 
<P>	Were PBS viewers three times as valuable as network audiences, or was the 
federally-subsidized network simply paying three times as much to reach the same 
people? Rather than reaching the most people for the least amount of money--a 
democratic mission--public broadcasting strives to reach a select group of people, no 
matter the cost. Such targeting of consumers happens all the time in the commercial 
marketplace. But it's hard to justify for a democratically funded organization.</P> 
<P>	This phenomenon of elitist and parochial disdain, then, begins to explain the 
unwillingness of the public broadcasting lobby to engage in the debate over the specifics 
of public broadcasting. The problem is not lack of money. It is simple snobbery on the 
part of public broadcasters. Federal tax dollars are considered "clean." Private donations, 
sponsorship, or underwriting is considered "dirty."</P>
<P>	Could the public broadcasting system become self-sufficient? Of course. The 
money is already there, within the same system that has been growing for more than 27 
years. As President Clinton himself told Brian Lamb in a C-Span interview during the 
1992 campaign, the public broadcasting system is pretty healthy, and he "didn't know 
that we needed to spend any more money on it." The president's own budget line item for 
CPB has been essentially frozen since he took office, and his administration actually 
proposed a 6 percent cut for public broadcasting in its 1996 budget.</P>

<H3>Drawing from the Well</H3>
<P>	Where could taxpayer funding find a substitute? Any number of combinations and 
permutations of replacement funders spring to mind.</P>
<UL><LI>  More than 5.2 million members contribute some $391 million annually to public-
broadcasting stations. That's about $75 each. Since public-broadcasting membership 
represents the top stratum of the socioeconomic ladder, were each subscriber simply to 
pledge $56 additional each year, it would yield public broadcasting $290 million--the 
entire federal share. Not too difficult a challenge, considering that the average net worth 
of the membership of WETA, a PBS station in Washington, D.C., is $627,000, according 
to <I>USA Today</I>.<BR> 
<LI>  The private foundations that support public broadcasting are among the richest entities 
in America today. They include the multi-billion-dollar Ford, MacArthur, Warhol, and 
Rockefeller foundations. Certainly these vast accumulators of wealth could increase their 
contributions to public broadcasting as well. The Ford Foundation alone has a $6 billion 
endowment. If public broadcasting were a genuine priority for them, private foundations 
could make up the $290 million annual appropriation from their own bank accounts.<BR>
<LI>  The commercial radio and television networks that benefit from the fact that PBS and 
National Public Radio serve to crowd out potential competitors could fund public 
broadcasting in the same way that cable companies pay for C-Span, as a cost of doing 
business and a way of increasing corporate goodwill. Split between NBC, ABC, CBS, 
and Fox, the sum required would be about $75 million each, and no doubt the networks 
could barter programs onto the schedule as part of the contribution. This system was 
actually used by Margaret Thatcher's government in Great Britain to establish Channel 
Four--originally proposed as taxpayer-supported. A private corporation owned by the 
other commercial television companies and known collectively as Independent Television 
(ITV), Channel Four was so successful at nurturing alternative and diverse television 
programming that it has actually begun to support itself, even attracting commercial 
sponsors. It frequently draws better than the BBC's arts and cultural channel, BBC-2.<BR>
<LI>  Hollywood stars are quite vocal in their support of public broadcasting, lining up to 
testify at congressional hearings. But they haven't yet confessed that they are in a better 
position than most to make up for the federal share. Entertainer Barbara Streisand, who 
makes $10 million to $15 million per picture while warning about the deleterious effects 
of cutting public television funding, admitted in a recent speech at Harvard that 
Americans spend about $340 billion annually on the entertainment industry. A donation 
from the Hollywood moguls totaling only one-half of 1 percent of those receipts would 
amount to more than five times the federal share to all of public broadcasting.</UL>
<P>	What's going on here? Are CPB and its offspring, NPR and PBS, hapless paupers 
dependent on the federal dole? Or are they sophisticated business ventures whose profit 
potential remains untapped? Which is it? Although Streisand denounces conservatives for 
emphasizing the private sector, she has chosen to work with commercial Hollywood 
studios and record companies. Stars like Streisand, along with other "arts advocates" 
from groups like the Creative Coalition such as Blair Brown, Christopher Reeve, Ron 
Silver, and William and Alec Baldwin, could agree to donate their time to do one 
television special a year for public broadcasting. They could get their Hollywood friends 
to join them, and the programming could be used as pledge specials. If such stars 
appeared for free on PBS, their shows could be used for fundraising, much like <I>The Three 
Tenors</I> is used now.</P>
<P>	How much money could Hollywood raise for public broadcasting? You do the 
math: Streisand brought in a cool $1 million for then-candidate Bill Clinton at a 1992 
fundraiser. In 1986, she raised $1.5 million for a group of six Democratic congressional 
candidates. Forbes magazine estimates Streisand earned $52 million in 1994.</P> 
<P>	Other big-money show-business stars (according to Forbes) include Oprah 
Winfrey, who made $53 million last year, Bill Cosby ($34 million), Harrison Ford ($27 
million), Bruce Willis ($19 million), Tom Hanks ($16 million), Kevin Costner ($15 
million), Tom Cruise ($14 million), Eddie Murphy ($13 million), and Roseanne ($13 
million). The richest of them all is Steven Spielberg. Forbes magazine estimates 
Spielberg makes $165 million to $170 million annually.</P>
<P>	We know where at least some of their money goes. Spielberg donated $161,000 to 
Democrats running for Congress. Five studio political-action committees gave $866,798 
to Democrats (compared to $187,050 to Republicans). MCA chairman Lew Wasserman 
gave more than $230,000 to Democrats in 1992, compared to $6,000 to Republicans. In 
1992 Disney's Jeffrey Katzenberg (now partnered with Spielberg and music mogul David 
Geffen in a new company) gave over $100,000 to Democrats and $2,000 to Republicans. 
Disney's Michael Eisner gave $19,000 to Democrats and $3,000 to Republicans. Eisner, 
it should be remembered, sold almost $200 million worth of Disney stock after the 
election of Bill Clinton because he feared higher taxes. That one transaction was worth 
almost the entire amount the Corporation for Public Broadcasting spent on PBS in 1992.</P>
<P>   With the biggest names from the silver screen appearing on PBS, there is no question 
but audiences would rise to the occasion. In fact, PBS President Duggan, in a speech to 
affiliates last year, said he would love to have a Barbra Streisand special on PBS for 
pledge week. No doubt CD sales alone would make a startling contribution to the PBS 
budget. Yet so far, Barbra is still operating in the commercial sphere. Why?</P>
<P>	Underwriters would surely love to be associated with top stars, and so private 
support would no doubt more than make up the federal shortfall. Indeed, producers like 
Norman Lear (founder of People for the American Way) might even agree to produce 
series for PBS and donate their fees as contributions, with residual rights reverting to 
PBS.</P>
<UL><LI>  As Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD) showed, the telephone companies seem to be willing 
to provide free over-the-air educational and cultural programming in exchange for the 
right to enter the broadcasting business. Certainly regulators and corporations could 
arrange to make duplicate television stations available for other purposes while 
maintaining the core mission of public broadcasting as a cost of doing business.<BR>
<LI>  Cable companies like Jones Intercable also appear ready to step into the breach, 
providing public-service broadcasting in order to expand their activities. Such offers 
should be seriously considered. Another cablecaster expressing interest is the Discovery 
Network, which also runs The Learning Channel.<BR> 
<LI>  Finally, PBS could strike better deals with the producers of <I>Barney, Sesame Street, The 
Civil War, The Frugal Gourmet</I>, and the dozens of other extremely lucrative programs 
with merchandising tie-ins carried on the taxpayer-subsidized airwaves. Valuable air time 
is now given away for free to these producers, who know what to do with it. Producers of 
<I>Sesame Street</I>, for example, use the subsidized exposure to sell $800 million worth of 
some 5,000 licensed products annually. The show's producer, Children's Television 
Workshop, has about $70 million in stocks and bonds and pays its top executives more 
than $300,000 a year. Barney was estimated to sell about $500 million worth of products 
in 1993, and <I>Shining Time Station</I> garnered $250 million. Intelligent licensing deals alone 
could probably make up the lost federal subsidy from products connected to PBS's 
children's programming.</P></UL>
<P>	The recent announcement that CPB would get a share of <I>Barney's</I> net profits is 
unfortunately mere window dressing. In show business, only gross points are real dollars, 
and CPB does not share in the gross under any known contract. One reason that 
producers connected to public broadcasting have enjoyed such sweet arrangements is that 
the system is federally subsidized, There is no incentive to strike the most profitable deal. 
As media critic Brent Bozell noted in recent congressional testimony, it is very hard for 
public-broadcasting executives to go up to Capitol Hill and ask for increasing amounts of 
taxpayer money if they are making millions from selling T-shirts.</P>
<P>	And they are. The <I>Wireless</I> and <I>Signals</I> catalogs produced by Boston's WGBH 
and Minnesota Public Radio, for example, yield about $150 million in total. On the East 
Coast, PBS stations are partners in the Learningsmith chain of stores, pioneered by 
WGBH and WETA. On the West Coast, KCET owns a chain, The Store of Knowledge. 
Both are private firms that benefit from the cross-promotion, advertising, and corporate 
goodwill of their association with PBS. But their books are sealed to the public, exempted 
from the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
<P>	Public broadcasting can survive, indeed thrive, without a penny of scarce taxpayer 
dollars. There are many alternative sources of revenue, from station members, to 
corporate underwriters, to alternative programmers. Better deals can be struck with those 
who are exploiting the present system. The opposition to self-sufficiency is based not on 
practical considerations, but rather on an ideological commitment to the role of the 
federal government as the guarantor of culture and education--much as in Britain, where 
there are jams and jellies carrying the emblem, "by appointment to Her Majesty."</P> 
<P>	That is why the current debate over public broadcasting is so fierce. It is a 
struggle between those with an "unconstrained vision," in the words of economist 
Thomas Sowell, of an all-powerful central government run by an educated elite that does 
everything, including decide what is cultural and educational television. On the other side 
are those who feel a commitment to limited government. As Representative John Kasich 
(R-OH) recently put it, "the vast majority of people we hear from say, as we go into the 
21st century, government doesn't need to run a television station."</P>

<h3> SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON THE ALBANIAN ELECTIONS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a><br>

Executive Memorandum No. 453<br>
June 14, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;



Albania's May 26 parliamentary elections, which produced a landslide political victory for President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party, have come under fire. Opposition parties, led by the former communists of the Socialist Party, charge that the pro-Western Berisha government rigged the elections. While some international election observers have supported the opposition's charges of systematic voter fraud and intimidation, many of these observers -- particularly some of those in the election monitoring delegation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe-Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE-ODIHR) -- held a pronounced political bias in favor of the Socialists. Other monitors, such as those from the Washington-based International Republican Institute, have concluded that election violations were not widespread. This interpretation seems borne out by the fact that the election results were roughly similar to exit polls conducted by independent pollsters. The U.S. should avoid being stampeded into a rush to judgment against a friendly government based simply on unsubstantiated charges by anti-American Albanian leftists and their supporters in Western Europe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

That Albania's parliamentary elections were a rough and tumble affair is hardly surprising, considering that they were only the third free elections since the fall of the Albanian dictatorship. The elections pitted President Berisha's Democratic Party, which has been the driving force behind Albania's political and economic reforms, against the Socialist Party, the renamed successor to the communist party whose iron rule had lasted from 1944 to 1992. The contest was especially bitter because President Berisha had led the opposition forces that toppled the communists from power, and the Socialists were bent on political vengeance. When it became clear to them on election day that their efforts had fallen short, the Socialists withdrew from the elections in the late afternoon, charging that the elections had been a charade. Ironically, this cynical critique of Albania's nascent democracy was vigorously promoted by some of the same communists who had formed the backbone of the Stalinist regime of Enver Hoxa, who had plunged Albania into brutal repression and isolation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

President Berisha, a physician, is far from a dictator. He is a charismatic conservative leader who courageously spoke out against the communists, decisively defeated them in the 1992 elections, and pushed through a popular reform program that has brought great economic benefits to Europe's poorest country. Berisha's privatization reforms have spawned a flourishing private sector that has spearheaded Albania's economic growth, which has averaged about 10 percent annually in recent years. Given his popularity and the success of his political and economic programs, he had little need to rig the elections. Moreover, he had respected the workings of the democratic process in the past, such as the defeat of his proposal for a new constitution in a 1994 national referendum.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The first round of parliamentary elections on May 26 brought an impressive turnout of 89 percent of the Albanian electorate. Berisha's Democratic Party garnered approximately 68 percent of the vote, compared with 65 percent in the 1992 elections. Because the remaining votes splintered among six opposition parties, the Democratic Party won 95 of the 115 directly elected seats in the 140-seat parliament. The Socialist Party claimed that the election results were the product of systematic ballot box stuffing, electoral fraud, and intimidation, but by pulling out of the election monitoring commission on election day, it made it all but impossible to determine the scale of these alleged voting abuses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The election monitors of the OSCE-ODIHR, who have been the most inclined to support the opposition's claims of vote fraud, may be the least credible of the more than 100 international observers that monitored the elections. Mark Almond, a member of the British Helsinki Human Rights Group election monitoring team, turned up evidence that one team accredited by the OSCE-ODIHR monitoring mission was compromised by direct cooperation with the Socialists, who he suspects organized angry crowds of demonstrators at polling stations visited by the OSCE-ODIHR group. The team in question comprised nine members of a left-wing Norwegian group, Workers' International Solidarity, which enjoyed close relations with the Socialists and even requested translators and transportation from them. The OSCE-ODIHR mission also accredited other Socialist supporters, including a Dane who had organized tours of Albania for sympathetic foreigners during the communist era and a German, accused of a pro-Socialist bias in the German press, whose briefings of other election monitors were tendentious and highly emotional.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Significantly, several other monitoring groups contradicted the bleak picture of the elections presented by the OSCE-ODIHR group. The British Helsinki Human Rights Group found the elections to be free and fair. Jonathan Sunley, a member of the group who also had witnessed the 1991 Albanian elections, was struck by the vast improvement in political conditions, particularly "the orderliness and apparent impartiality surrounding the conduct of the election."  Sunley also noted that "compared with the elections held over the last 12 months in Armenia, Georgia, Belarus, and Russia, all of which were issued a clean bill of health, the infringements and irregularities in Albania were minor."  Election observers from the European Democratic Union also found the Albanian elections to be fair.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The International Republican Institute (IRI), which also deployed an election monitoring team, released a report asserting that "IRI observers did find that in most voting centers they visited the voting procedures were orderly, voter identification was being checked and stamped, and voters had the opportunity to cast a secret ballot in a calm atmosphere."  However, IRI observers did find some irregularities in a few voting centers, which led it to conclude that the results of certain parliamentary races -- but not the elections as a whole -- may have been compromised: "While not widespread, observed voting irregularities raise serious questions about the conduct and integrity of a number of Albania's 1996 Parliamentary contests."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

IRI commissioned an independent American-Albanian polling firm to conduct a survey of voters on election day that found that 62 percent of voters expressed approval of President Berisha and 71 percent were satisfied with the development of democracy. IRI's exit poll predicted that the Democratic Party would win 56 percent of the vote, the Socialists would win 22 percent, and the remainder would be split among a number of smaller parties. This exit poll, with a margin of error of 3.5 percent, is not out of line with the 68 percent of the votes claimed by the Democratic Party, especially considering that many Socialist voters may have foregone voting after the Socialists decided to boycott the elections late on election day. Clearly, if there was cheating, it did not decisively affect the outcome of the elections.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Nevertheless, the Albanian government has taken steps to remove doubts about the integrity of the elections. In an apparent concession to the opposition, President Berisha has ordered new elections to be held on June 16 in 17 parliamentary constituencies where there had been reports of significant irregularities. Berisha also ordered prosecutors to investigate charges of police brutality at a Socialist demonstration held in Tirana on May 29. Seven police officials subsequently were fired for failing to rein in police at the banned demonstration.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

This undoubtedly will not satisfy the Socialists, who seek to enlist foreign support to have the elections annulled, undermine President Berisha, and drive a wedge between Washington and Tirana. The Clinton Administration should not allow itself to be drawn into the Socialists' plans for what amounts to a coup d'etat against the pro-Western government. Washington should not be more supportive of the former communists than the Albanian people themselves have been. Seeking to appease the opposition by forcing more concessions from the Berisha government will only play into the hands of the Socialists, further polarize Albania, and jeopardize the long-term stability of a friendly country that has been one of the few beacons of hope in the volatile Balkan region.

<center><h2>LIFT THE ARMS EMBARGO ON BOSNIA</h2><p>
by <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
<b>Executive Memorandum 421</b><br>

July 18, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%><p>
</center>
<p>

	The July 11 seizure of the Bosnian Muslim enclave of Srebrenica by Bosnian Serb forces
has underscored the failure of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia. 
UNPROFOR peacekeeping troops once again have been taken hostage, unable to defend
themselves, let alone Bosnian civilians, against aggression by the Bosnian Serbs.  The fall of
Srebrenica, the first "safe area" to be declared by the U.N. in Bosnia, and the ongoing Serb
assault against the Zepa safe area highlight the vulnerability of the four remaining safe areas in
eastern Bosnia.  As the fighting in Bosnia continues to escalate, it is time for the Clinton
Administration to abandon its doomed policy on Bosnia, accept the inevitable withdrawal of the
ineffectual U.N. peacekeeping mission there, and lift the ill-considered arms embargo on the
Bosnian government.  <p>

<p>

	Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole has proposed that the U.S. do just that.  The Senate
this week will vote on his bill, S. 21, co-sponsored with Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT), that
will terminate the arms embargo after UNPROFOR withdraws or 12 weeks after it is requested
to do so by the Bosnian government.  The Clinton Administration has criticized Dole's proposal
as risking expansion of the fighting, overlooking the fact that the fighting already has raged out
of control despite the limp efforts of U.N. peacekeepers to contain it.  The Administration
stubbornly clings to the illusion that there is a peace to keep in Bosnia, when it is clear that both
sides are spoiling for a fight.<p>

<p>

	The sad truth is that President Clinton's policy zigzags have made a tragic situation in
Bosnia worse.  By repeatedly promising resolute action, such as U.S. air strikes or the
commitment of U.S. ground troops, and then retreating, Clinton has eroded U.S. credibility and
undermined NATO cohesion without appreciably slowing the steady slide of U.N. peacekeeping
forces into near-irrelevance.  The increasingly truculent Bosnian Serbs have steadily undermined
the U.N.'s three goals in Bosnia: to provide humanitarian aid to Bosnian civilians, to moderate
the ferocity of the fighting, and to encourage a diplomatic settlement. Peace efforts have failed
primarily because the Bosnian Serbs have concluded, based on their military superiority to date,
that they have more to gain by fighting than by negotiating.<p>

<p>

	The Serbs have been aided by the arms embargo on Yugoslavia imposed by the U.N. in
1991.  The arms embargo allowed the 80,000 man-Bosnian Serb militia, armed and supported by
neighboring Serbia, to retain control of the territory that it has conquered, roughly 70 percent of
Bosnia, in large part due to a near monopoly of heavy weapons.  The Bosnian government can
mobilize up to 200,000 men but has been unable to arm them because of  the embargo.  Less
than one in three of its potential fighters has weapons, and it is outgunned by the smaller Serb
force.  Nevertheless, the increasingly effective Bosnian army has scored some military successes
in recent months over Serb forces stretched thin along the 1,600-kilometer front.  This has
prompted the Serbs to step up their efforts to eliminate the isolated pro-government enclaves in
eastern Bosnia so that they can consolidate their forces.<p>

<p>

	As the situation in Bosnia continues to deteriorate, the Clinton Administration should:<p>

<p>

	<b>* End the failed U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia</b>.  The 24,700-man UNPROFOR
contingent clearly has lost its credibility with all Bosnian factions. Withdrawal would be better
sooner than later.  If a pull-out is to be completed before winter snows clog the rugged Bosnian
road network, a decision to withdraw must be made by the end of August.<p>

<p>

	<b>*  Rule out the commitment of U.S. ground troops, except to extract UNPROFOR.</b> 
French President Jacques Chirac has asked President Clinton to deploy U.S. troops to reinforce
the remaining U.N. safe areas.  Clinton rejected this, but the Administration reportedly still is
considering providing logistical support for U.N. troops in the safe areas that would involve the
dispatch of heavy-lift and combat helicopters over Serb-held territory.  This would be a
dangerous mistake.  It would raise the stakes of U.S. involvement without significantly changing
the situation on the ground.  If France and other nations involved in the failed peacekeeping
effort unwisely choose to escalate their involvement, they should do so without counting on
American backing.  The U.S. has no vital interest at stake in Bosnia.  U.S. troops therefore
should be committed only in an emergency to save U.N. peacekeeping troops that are being
withdrawn, not risked to help them prolong their ill-fated mission.<p>

<p>

	If called upon to fulfill President Clinton's promise to provide up to 25,000 U.S. troops
as part of a 60,000-strong NATO force to extricate UNPROFOR, the U.S. should do so only if
its troops are under exclusive NATO command, free from U.N. interference and equivocation. 
Moreover, U.S. troops should operate under rules of engagement which allow for massive
retaliation, instead of  half-hearted pinprick reprisals, if U.S. forces are attacked.  Although the
Bosnian Serbs probably will not seek to block the withdrawal of U.N. forces, they will seek to
capture U.N. military equipment.  No U.S. troops should be risked to retrieve equipment. 
Instead, the countries that contributed peacekeepers should warn the Serbs that they will provide
the Bosnian government with three times the amount of military equipment that the Serbs seize
during the withdrawal.  Sadly, many of the problems related to a withdrawal are likely to come
from Bosnian Muslims embittered by the U.N.'s failure to live up to their high expectations.  The
U.S. should warn the Bosnian government that any prospects for future cooperation will rest on
its full cooperation during the withdrawal of U.N. forces.  President Clinton should appear on
national television to state clearly the limited and temporary nature of the U.S. military
commitment and warn the warring Balkan factions against interfering with the extraction
operation.<p>

<p>

	<b>*  Lift the arms embargo on Bosnia</b>.  After U.N. forces have been withdrawn, there
should be no excuse for preventing the Bosnian government from arming itself in self-defense.  
The U.S. should terminate the embargo because it contravenes Bosnia's right of self-defense, a
violation of  Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. The U.S. and NATO then should consider arming
the Bosnian government, but should rule out air strikes or logistical support that could entangle
NATO in the war.  Washington must be careful not to feed Bosnian hopes of increased U.S.
backing, for that will encourage the Bosnian government to form unrealistic expectations that
will make it less amenable to the hard compromises that will be required of both sides if there is
to be a negotiated settlement.<p>

<p>

	<b>*  Maintain economic sanctions against Serbia until it helps push through an
acceptable settlement in Bosnia.</b>  Economic sanctions and the arms embargo should not be
lifted until Serbia has forced its proxies in Bosnia to accept a settlement that will return most of
Bosnia to government control.<p>

<p>

<b>CONCLUSION<p>

</b><p>

	The withdrawal of  U.N. forces and lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia will lead
to greater bloodshed in the short run. But the risks of this course of action are outweighed by the
risks of continuing the current policy of bluster and retreat, which has led the U.N.
"peacekeepers" to become impotent bystanders as war rages around them.  By lifting the arms
embargo, the U.S. can help the Bosnians to defend themselves without becoming inextricably
bogged down in the Balkan quagmire.  Moreover, by allowing the Bosnians to build their
military strength and increase their ability to recover lost territory, the U.S. can help lay the
groundwork for a viable political settlement in the long run. <p>

<title>The Succession Struggle Begins in Russia -- Heritage</title>

<h3>THE SUCCESSION STRUGGLE BEGINS IN RUSSIA</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm"> Ariel Cohen, Ph.D.</a><br> 
Senior Policy Analyst <br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 457<br>
August 13, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Lieutenant General (Ret.) Alexander Lebed, Russia's new National Security Council Secretary and President Boris Yeltsin's defense aide, already is locked in a succession struggle with Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin. The outcome of this battle is particularly important in view of reports of President Yeltsin's poor health. The nomination of Lebed protege Colonel-General Igor Rodionov as Russia's Defense Minister on July 17 has strengthened Lebed's hand. The nomination of reformist Anatoly Chubais as Yeltsin's Chief of Staff strengthens the democratic faction and the Chernomyrdin camp. A situation of such uncertainty requires that U.S. policymakers maintain dialogue with all factions in Moscow, including General Lebed's.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Lebed joined the Yeltsin administration after the first round of presidential elections, and the next act of the Russian political drama began immediately, leaving little time for the thorough discussion of policy direction that Russia so badly needs. In exchange for supporting Yeltsin, Lebed demanded that Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, his former commander and boss, be fired. He also asked for and received a broad mandate to lead and reform both the military and the security forces.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

No sooner had he joined Yeltsin's administration than Lebed offended his new boss by saying that he, Lebed, might become president before the year 2000, when Yeltsin's term expires. Lebed is lobbying aggressively to be appointed to the currently nonexistent position of vice president, which would give him supreme power if Yeltsin was incapacitated. This was met with a sharp rebuke from Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, who said that Russia is still recovering from its experience with the previous Vice President, the flamboyant Alexander Rutskoy, who politically self-destructed in 1993. Lebed also may have annoyed Yeltsin by lobbying publicly to expand his authority as the de facto head of the Russian National Security Council.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The ambitious general has embarked on a power-grabbing expedition. No one knows where Lebed's anti-corruption drive may end, and who may become its next victim. In Russia's current legal limbo, almost anyone can be charged with corruption.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Western Russia-watchers initially looked upon Lebed as a born-again liberal. However, conversations by the author with his staff in Moscow indicate that the general, as they call him, is no follower of Jefferson. He hired, then dropped, a Moscow economist by the name of Vitaly Naishul, who is an admirer of Chilean General Augusto Pinochet's economic policies. Naishul is credited with writing a large part of "Truth and Order," Lebed's no-nonsense, market oriented election platform. But he also believes that Lebed, if he becomes president, needs to "nominate a professional parliament which will consist of experts" -- a chilling thought for those in Russia who believe in universal suffrage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Lebed's sophisticated image-makers are deeply disenchanted with Russia's experiment with democracy and far too ready to drop it for imperial grandeur and "real power."  Moreover, the key roles in Lebed's inner circle increasingly are being played by hard-line military veterans who would like to re-orient Russia away from the West and toward cooperation with Iran and Iraq. One such insider -- Heydar Jemal, Chairman of the Islamic Committee of Russia, which claims to represent Russia's 20-million-strong Muslim community -- allegedly has  close links to the Islamic regime in Tehran, according to the newspaper Izvestiya.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There are no guarantees that Lebed will remain a democrat. He sees his Security Council position as a stepping-stone to the presidency. Moreover, certain sectors of Russian society like the military-industrial complex, the security forces, and the armed forces remain inherently hard-line and can be counted on to seek senior political figures to represent them at the pinnacle of power. General Lebed seems almost tailor-made for the job.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

However, it is not clear whether Lebed will survive the infighting within the Kremlin. Yeltsin is a master of balance-of-power intrigue, and Lebed's utility dropped greatly after the second round of elections. In the words of one senior Russian diplomat, speaking recently off the record at The Heritage Foundation, "the Kremlin ice is so slippery -- you either learn how to skate, or you fall and break your bones."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Prime Minister Chernomyrdin is aware of Lebed's ambitious plans and already is taking steps to preempt the general in the forthcoming battle for succession. A veteran of Soviet and Russian power struggles, Chernomyrdin projects the image of a no-nonsense manager. He will retain the reins of the economy and close ties within the energy sector (he was Minister of the Gas Industry during the Gorbachev administration). Chernomyrdin enjoys the trust of the Soviet-era industrial managers: He is "one of them."  But he also will be supported by the new Russian business elite. If Chubais works in tandem with Chernomyrdin against Lebed, the backing of wealthy Russian bankers will be guaranteed as well.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Western multilateral financial organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have invested heavily in a relationship with the Russian Prime Minister, and so has Clinton's White House through the high-powered Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which supervises everything from space cooperation to defense conversion. The West would prefer to see the stolid and predictable Chernomyrdin at Russia's helm rather than the mercurial nationalist Lebed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

America and the West need to understand that the Lebed-Chernomyrdin power struggle has begun. In this struggle, the powerful Russian oil and gas industry will deploy its financial might against the muscle of the armed forces and security services. Lebed may rally to his side the nationalists and the inherently hard-line national security establishment. But Kremlin insiders view Lebed (whose name means "swan" in Russian) not as a regal bird, but as a raging bull on the Kremlin's slippery ice. The prognosis for his long-term success, while guarded, has improved with the nomination of Rodionov as head of the "Moscow Pentagon."  The outcome of this struggle will depend also on President Yeltsin's health, vigor, and longevity in office.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The U.S. and the West should establish an intensive dialog with Lebed and his staff. The general has shown that he is a quick study and that he possesses a good measure of common sense. But he is inexperienced about the West and its ways and values; he comes from the Soviet armed forces and therefore has received his share of indoctrination in anti-Western xenophobia and Russian nationalism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Lebed should be invited both to Washington and to NATO headquarters in Brussels. He has yet to make up his mind about solutions to many of the burning issues facing Russia, such as economic and military reform and the fight against crime and corruption, and may be receptive to Western views, policy inputs, and assistance. While National Security Advisor Anthony Lake is Lebed's official counterpart, Secretary of Defense William Perry, who coordinates military and security aspects of the Administration's Russia policy, would be the best candidate to invite Lebed to Washington. Perry has the knowledge and interest in Russian affairs to educate Lebed about the U.S. and the West. In any event, a long-term dialogue between Lebed and American security officials should begin now.

Executive Memorandum No. 454<br>
June 24, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first round of the Russian presidential elections, held on Sunday June 16, 1996, confirms a trend that began with the parliamentary elections in December 1995: Russia is now holding regular national elections that are relatively free and fair. This is no small achievement for a country that has known such leaders as Ivan the Terrible and Josef Stalin. These elections strengthen Russian democracy, and credit should go to the Russian people. But credit should go also to Boris Yeltsin and even presidential candidate Mikhail Gorbachev, who received only 0.5 percent of the vote. They shepherded their country toward a participatory political system after decades of totalitarian communism.
<p>


<b>Communist and nationalist messages rejected.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Communist Gennady Zyuganov and ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky seem to be failing to obtain a democratic majority. Zyuganov received 31.96 percent of the vote, while Zhirinovsky got only 5.78 percent, down from the 11 percent his party received in the last election. Most Russians are unhappy with the Yeltsin administration, but they prefer the continuation of market reforms and individual freedoms, even under Yeltsin's faltering leadership, to a return to the communist past. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Boris Yeltsin shrewdly turned the elections into a referendum on communism, polarizing the electorate and saturating the airwaves and print media with anti-communist messages. The Russian President masterfully played on the fear that a communist victory would lead to a new civil war. The communists played into his hands by refusing to adapt their ideology to the new times and new generation. Unlike their Central European colleagues, who by and large have transformed themselves into Western-style social democrats, Russian communists have preserved the spirit, the name, and the trappings of Lenin's party and teachings, adding to them a particularly virulent brand of Russian chauvinism. This not only makes Russian communists appear to be throwbacks to the past. It also limits their voter appeal, especially among the young and the business class.
<p>


<b>The Messengers and the Messages.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; There was also a tremendous difference in style between Yeltsin and Zyuganov. Yeltsin ran a modern, Western-style campaign, complete with "Rock the Vote" concerts, "Choose or You Lose" slogans, widespread television advertising, and media advisers imported from the U.S. By contrast, the communists relied on door-to-door canvassing and tedious party meetings. Yeltsin's new style of campaigning paid off. His popularity surged from single digits in January to an impressive 35 percent, while the communists failed to expand their electoral base, which hovers around 30 percent. Yeltsin made great strides in spite of the dire economic crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During his campaign, Yeltsin took advantage of his incumbency, promising everything from pension increases to wage and stipend hikes and even tax breaks for entire regions. He leaned on the media to ensure favorable coverage for himself. The liberal media were only too glad to deliver the anti-communist message. They did not want to see their freedoms dashed by a return to communist repression.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The impressive vote for retired Lieutenant General Alexander Lebed, who received 14.8 percent of the vote, demonstrated public nostalgia for great power prestige and a thirst for law and order. But the General Lebed of today is not the unabashed hard-liner he was two years ago. He is a professed convert to the gospel of the free market, small state, and democratic principles and procedures. He also seems to recognize the limits of Russian imperialism. The general knows that over 80 percent of the Russian public does not support using military power in the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, not even to assist ethnic Russians residing there. The majority of Russians favor an immediate end to the war in Chechnya, and a plurality even favor Chechen independence as the price for bringing troops home. Lebed has been a bitter critic of Yeltsin's war in Chechnya. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Market economist Grigory Yavlinsky, a Western-style liberal who garnered only 7.42 percent of the vote, finished fourth. He failed to establish himself as the viable alternative to Boris Yeltsin and ran a mediocre campaign that was low on cash and weak on organization. Yavlinsky reportedly does not enjoy stump speeches and campaign travel-- a handicap in a country of eleven time zones. He now has four years to build his Yabloko party into the sort of political machine he must have to win the presidency in the year 2000. He has a long road before him. His intellectual style and politics seem to be out of favor with many Russian voters. 
<p>


<b>The New Russian Electorate.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The first round of the presidential elections demonstrated that the majority of the Russian people eschew the message of the cradle-to-grave welfare state, restoration of the Soviet Union, and militant Russian chauvinism. Moreover, the voters seem to be afraid that the communists would take away the freedoms they are learning to enjoy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The electorate was divided in more ways than one. How these divisions develop in the future will have a huge impact on whether democracy takes root in Russia. The agricultural South and the economically depressed areas of European Russia went for Zyuganov, while most of the resource-rich Far East, Siberia and the North, and the relatively more prosperous large cities voted for Yeltsin and Yavlinsky. The electorate under 35 years of age, large city dwellers, and voters with higher education rejected the communist message. By contrast, rural dwellers, voters over 55 years old, and people with only a secondary education cast their votes for Zyuganov. As older voters pass away, the younger generation that tends to be more democratic will gain more influence in Russian politics. Pro-reform regions in the Far East and Siberia also may continue to grow in political influence, which is good news not only for reform, but for the national unity of Russia's far-flung regions. 
<p>


<b>Second Round Crucial.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; All of this is good news, but it should not be exaggerated. The degree of popular discontent in Russia should not be underestimated. A Yeltsin victory in the upcoming runoff elections, now scheduled for July 3, is not guaranteed. Zyuganov will do his best to play on voter frustrations to win. However, Boris Yeltsin is a master politician. The nomination of Alexander Lebed to serve as Russia's Head of the Security Council and Yeltsin's national security aide, and the firing of Lebed's unpopular rival, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, make the Yeltsin ticket particularly strong. An even greater boost to Yeltsin's popularity is his firing of the unpopular chief of the Kremlin Guards, General Alexander Korzhakov, as well as Internal Security chief Mikhail Barsukov and Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. Moreover, if Yeltsin brings Grigory Yavlinsky into the government as the economic policy czar, or otherwise secures his endorsement, he will improve his chances for re-election significantly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Voter turnout will be an extremely important factor in the runoff. The communist electorate is disciplined, and Yeltsin will need to pay close attention to getting out the vote in order to achieve victory. Otherwise, many voters may decide that Yeltsin's victory is a foregone conclusion and stay away from the voting booths, attending their garden plots and summer homes.
<p>

<b>Conclusion.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; From under the rubble of the former communist economy, a new Russia is emerging, complete with a consumer society and concerns about businesses and jobs. This is a new Russia whose face is much more familiar to Westerners than its previous communist one. The many problems between Russia and the West will not disappear -- problems such as differences over NATO expansion, suppling nuclear reactors to Iran, and Moscow's assertiveness outside its borders in the countries of the former Soviet Union. But at least there is hope that these problems can be worked out with Boris Yeltsin. The new Russia is making its choice for freedom, and it savors the occasion. While comprehensive economic and political reforms are painful and may take at least a generation, the current elections bring a glimmer of hope.

Talking Points No. 12<br>
April 12, 1996	<br>
<hr width=50%></center><P>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Bill Clinton will meet President Boris Yeltsin of Russia for the sixth time at the Moscow nuclear safety and security summit on April 19-20. In addition to the United States and Russia, the G-7 states and Ukraine will participate in the summit. The heads of state will discuss nuclear reactor safety, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and nuclear terrorism. Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin also will meet separately to discuss a broad range of bilateral issues. This will be their last official meeting before Russian voters cast their ballots in the June 16 presidential elections. Clinton's counterpart faces an uncertain political future, and so do U.S.-Russian relations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 The United States has a stake in the outcome of the Russian presidential elections. The most desirable result -- a pro-Western democratic reformer in the Kremlin -- is very unlikely. The worst-case scenario will be the victory of hard-line communists led by Gennady Zyuganov. In the December 1995 elections, communists, nationalists, and their allies captured over 46 percent of the popular vote for the Duma (the lower house of the Russian parliament).<sup>1</sup>  A communist takeover will turn Russia back in time, to central planning, human rights violation, re-militarization, and aggressive foreign policy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Boris Yeltsin today draws criticism from many Russian democrats. He backtracked on the program of radical reforms he spearheaded in 1991-1993. He looks and acts increasingly authoritarian and at times, erratic. Free market and democratic reforms in Russia have stalled. Until recently, Yeltsin was trailing the most popular candidate, Communist Party leader Zyuganov, by at least 5 percentage points. According to the latest polls, Yeltsin is closing the gap, running almost neck-and-neck. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another dangerous contender for the presidency is Vladimir Zhirinovsky, an anti-American ultra-nationalist with a penchant for political surprises and a strong track record in the elections. Victory for Zyuganov or an increase in Zhirinovsky's influence would gravely endanger any hope for democracy and market reforms surviving in Russia. A communist or a nationalist at Russia's helm could place that country, with its considerable military power, on a collision course with the United States in Central Europe or the Middle East. Thus Yeltsin increasingly looks to be the lesser of two evils, and on that basis merits qualified U.S. support.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Russian-American relations have been deteriorating for some time. Russia has been drifting away from the West, as demonstrated by disagreements over the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the START II nuclear arms treaty, and the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty. There also have been differences over the sale of Russian nuclear reactors to Iran, the sale of weapons to rogue Third World regimes, and the continuing brutal war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton should not sweep these disagreements under the rug at the Moscow Summit. Nor should he cave into Russian demands in the hopes of boosting Yeltsin's chances in the June elections. This would be seen by many Russian voters as unacceptable meddling in Russian internal affairs and a sign of American weakness or naivete‚. Moreover, even a modest endorsement of Yeltsin's bid for the presidency would further alienate the many Russians who dislike Yeltsin. An endorsement could backfire, providing Yeltsin's opposition with political ammunition to attack him as an "American puppet." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Therefore, at the Moscow summit, President Clinton should:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Be firm</b> in expressing American support for democracy, elections, free markets, and individual rights in Russia, discouraging both Yeltsin and the hard-liners from seeking anti-democratic solutions.
<p>
<li><b>Voice strong support</b> and American commitment for independence, sovereignty, and the territorial integrity of the New Independent States (NIS).
<p>
<li><b>Denounce</b> the atrocities in Chechnya which have led to heavy loss of civilian life. 
<p>
<li><b>Oppose</b> the sale by Russia of nuclear reactors to Iran.
<p>
<li><b>Support</b> NATO expansion, making clear that it does not threaten Russia.
<p>
<li><b>Avoid</b> negotiating on arms control issues.
</ul><p>
<b>THE UNCERTAIN FUTURE OF YELTSIN AND U.S.-RUSSIAN RELATIONS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A dark cloud hovers over President Yeltsin's election prospects. His political platform is murky. Critics say that he has abandoned democratic principles and policies in favor of populism and political survival. The war in Chechnya, severe economic difficulties, and rampant crime and corruption have drastically eroded the popularity of his administration. Polls show Yeltsin's approval ratings are barely in the 15-20 percent range. While his entourage insists that the elections will take place as scheduled, many in Russia question whether they will, or whether the vote count will be fair.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yeltsin today is not the popular democrat the world watched in admiration as he overturned the Soviet Union in 1991. He is presiding over the return of hard-line Soviet nomenklatura to top positions of power. He has lost the support of many Russian reformers, and is pursuing a foreign policy that is increasingly confrontational with the U.S. and the West. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton has placed personal relations with Boris Yeltsin above U.S. policy objectives. As Yeltsin's popularity plummeted, Clinton fed the flames of Russian resentment toward the U.S. by giving the Russian president unequivocal support, especially after the canonnade of the Russian Supreme Soviet in 1993 and the beginning of the Chechen war in 1994. As a result, the U.S. is now perceived by many in the Russian political elite as partisan and uncritically supportive of Yeltsin's faltering policies. The Clinton policy has endangered the ability of the U.S. to maintain a relationship with democrats in Russia who oppose President Yeltsin.
<p>
<b>ARMS CONTROL: NO COMPROMISES ON AMERICAN SECURITY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the announced agenda of the multilateral summit on civilian nuclear safety was not to cover arms control, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin decided in the fall of 1995 to add a bilateral Russian-American summit during President Clinton's Moscow visit. The addition of the bilateral summit could tempt the Russians to raise issues related to arms control that were not on the agenda for the multilateral summit and which the U.S. side will be unprepared to address. These may include:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Amendments to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.</b> The Russians may press their demands to amend the ABM Treaty so that the treaty's restrictions extend to the now-unrestricted development and deployment of defenses against short-range missiles. The Russians also may demand that Russia and other former Soviet republics be established as treaty successors to the Soviet Union. Congress has expressed its interest in amending the treaty to ease restrictions on developing and deploying defenses against long-range missiles, and Russia may inquire about these congressional plans. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Negotiations on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).</b> Russia may inquire about the Clinton Administration's plans to conclude a CTBT this year.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Ratification of the 1993 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II (START II).</b> The Russian Duma has yet to consent to the ratification of START II, which cuts U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals to 3,500 deliverable warheads each. Russian representatives may press the U.S. to accept either changes in START II itself or limitations on U.S. arms not covered by START II in order to gain acquiescence of the Duma.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Ratification of the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).</b> The U.S. Senate has not yet ratified the CWC. The Russians may inquire if the U.S. will ratify this treaty, which bars the development, stockpiling, and deployment, as well as the use, of chemical weapons by participating states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration should make it very clear to the Russians that it will not negotiate on arms control issues at either the multilateral or bilateral summit in Moscow. Arms control negotiations should take place only at forums established specifically for addressing these issues. Mistakes of historic proportions can be made at <i>ad hoc</i> arms control negotiations. Therefore, arms control issues should not be raised by the U.S. delegations during the Moscow visit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

If representatives from Russia or other states raise these arms control issues during the Moscow visit, U.S. representatives, including the President himself, should have prepared responses in the form of unilateral statements to foreclose any negotiations on the relevant subjects. U.S. representatives should state explicitly to their counterparts that the unilateral statements are not subject to further discussion in the Moscow talks.
<p>
<b>THE MOSCOW SUMMIT AGENDA: SUPPORTING U.S. INTERESTS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To support U.S. interests at the Moscow summit, President Clinton should:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Be firm in expressing American support for democracy, elections, free markets, and individual rights in Russia</b>, discouraging both Yeltsin and the hard-liners from seeking anti-democratic solutions to Russia's problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should develop a Russian policy based on the support of ideas and interests, not on the fate of individual politicians. The U.S. should support democracy and free markets, as well as political forces advocating these ideas. Yeltsin is the elected president of Russia and was a key figure in bringing about the collapse of the Soviet communism. Today, however, some of his policies and his personal style are controversial, and his popularity is low. There are many other democratic reformers, including former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, presidential candidate Grigory Yavlinsky, and human rights activists Sergei Kovalev and Yelena Bonner, who disagree fundamentally with Yeltsin's policies on economic reform and Chechnya. Clinton would be well-advised to meet with these pro-Western reformers to demonstrate his support for the democratic and free-market path for Russia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Voice strong support and American commitment for independence, sovereignty, and the territorial integrity of the New Independent States (NIS).</b> The President should make clear that furtive or bullish attempts to extend Russian domination in the "near abroad," especially in the Ukraine and the Baltic states, would result in American countermeasures across the spectrum of the Russian-American relationship.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should oppose Russian attempts to impose a sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union. Moscow is attempting to re-establish its "sphere of influence" in neighboring regions that were once a part of the Soviet Union. Recent evidence of this is the customs union created with Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan on March 29, 1996, and the Commonwealth of Sovereign Republics, known by its Russian acronym SSR, signed with Belarus on April 2, 1996, in Moscow. While these agreements were largely voluntary, the Kremlin may employ a combination of economic, diplomatic, and even military means in the future to achieve integration of what Moscow calls its "near abroad" -- the Baltic States, Ukraine, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. The U.S. should not endorse the creation of a Russian sphere of influence in the CIS, as President Clinton reportedly did in a recent conversation with Boris Yeltsin.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Preventing the emergence of a Russian empire in the lands of the former Soviet Union should be a top Western priority. Yet the Clinton Administration until recently was very tolerant towards Russian assertiveness in the "near abroad."<sup>3</sup>  The Clinton Administration also has been too slow to recognize the importance of countries in the region other than Russia. For example, without Ukraine, the Russian empire cannot be recreated and will have only limited access to the heart of Europe. Ukraine's independence is an important Western interest. Azerbaijan controls vital oil and gas reserves, while Georgia is situated in a strategically crucial location in the Caucasus. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Denounce the atrocities in Chechnya which have led to heavy loss of civilian life.</b> The President should call for a cessation of hostilities in Chechnya and an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mediation effort in the conflict.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should support a negotiated solution to the Chechen war that would keep Russian territorial integrity intact, but also recognize the aspirations of the Chechen people for autonomy. Overt Russian military action in Chechnya began on December 12, 1994, when the army marched on the capital city of Grozny. The city was destroyed by a brutal aerial, tank, and artillery assault. Since the start of the campaign, over 30,000 people have been killed, scores have been wounded, and more than 400,000 became refugees. Until now, the Russian army has failed to find a military solution to the Chechen problem, which resulted in a political disaster for Yeltsin. Yeltsin's critics in Moscow have said that a secret order was given to the Russian troops in Chechnya to destroy the civilian population of villages that support the rebels. The cease-fire declared in summer 1995 collapsed. On March 31, 1996, Yeltsin called for yet another new peace plan and a negotiated solution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Oppose the sale by Russia of nuclear reactors to Iran.</b> The U.S. should offer the Russians an alternative deal that would sidetrack the reactor sale to Iran. One possibility is a modernization program to upgrade the safety of the dangerous and obsolete Russian nuclear reactors. If Yeltsin refuses, the U.S. should retaliate by cancelling the $1 billion in Export-Import Bank credits to lease civilian aircraft to Aeroflot.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Russian-Iranian nuclear reactor deal must be a higher priority at U.S.-Russian summits. The Clinton Administration did not highlight this issue sufficiently at the 1995 Clinton-Yeltsin summits, passing it to the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission, which failed to find a solution. This is a serious mistake. The Islamic regime in Tehran is buying two Russian-made nuclear reactors capable of producing plutonium that can be enriched to become weapons-grade raw material for atomic bombs. Russia is interested in selling even more reactors to Tehran. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has opposed this sale, believing it could endanger both Russian and Western security. But the sale is going through anyway, primarily because of pressure from the powerful Ministry of Atomic Industry (MinAtom), headed by Victor Mikhailov, and because of the short-sightedness of Russia's top nuclear industry officials. If Tehran wants an additional source of electricity, Russia could sell electrical power from its own ample resources.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Support NATO expansion, making clear that it does not threaten Russia.</b> Moscow should not have veto power over NATO's decisions to add new members. The U.S. should support NATO enlargement, but keep the door open for Russian participation in the European security dialogue. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration has paid lip service to the issue of NATO enlargement to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, but has done very little to make it happen. Some observers accuse the Administration of promising Russia not to expand NATO in 1996 in exchange for cooperation on peacekeeping in Bosnia. NATO enlargement is aimed at wiping the results of Yalta and the Potsdam post-World War II division of Europe from the map. If these countries do not join NATO, they will be left in a strategic gray zone which Russia may try to exploit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should make a political commitment to bring Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and possibly Slovakia into NATO. The 1994 Contract With America stipulated that NATO enlargement, should be a high U.S. national security priority. Russian and Western military experts need to discuss the contingencies of expansion, to make it more transparent, and if need be, to assuage Russian fears.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Russia has voiced many security concerns regarding NATO expansion. Some of these are illegitimate, such as trying to maintain Russian arms exports to the former Warsaw Pact satellites, or intimidating the Baltic States. Others are more legitimate, such as questions about where nuclear weapons will be stationed. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While Russia's security concerns should be discussed in bilateral and multilateral negotiations, Russia should not be given a veto power (<i>droit de regard</i>) to define who will be accepted into the enlarged Atlantic Alliance and under what circumstances. Moscow's worries can be allayed in protocols and memoranda of understanding. However, under no circumstances should the NATO treaty be changed or amended under Russian pressure.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Inform the Russians that further negotiations to draft a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) are fruitless.</b> Clinton should tell Yeltsin that the U.S. will withdraw its representative from the negotiations in Geneva and will resume nuclear tests as soon as preparations allow. In keeping with the recommended position that the U.S. not participate in arms control negotiations during the Moscow visit, Clinton should not raise this issue himself, but respond with a unilateral statement only if pressed by the Russians.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should not be seeking a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. U.S. representatives are engaged in negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to draft a treaty on banning nuclear tests. The negotiations come at a time when the U.S. has observed a moratorium on testing that was supposed to be honored by the other four nuclear weapons states (China, France, Great Britain, and Russia). But China and France already have conducted tests in violation of the moratorium. The Clinton Administration is now trying to determine whether Russia conducted a secret test. The tests by other nuclear powers only demonstrate the necessity of further testing to maintain the reliability and effectiveness of the existing U.S. nuclear arsenal and to modernize it. Instead of negotiating a ban on testing, the U.S. should state its determination to maintain its nuclear deterrent through a prudent testing program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Inform Russia that non-strategic missile defenses are not subject to the restriction of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.</b> Clinton should warn Yeltsin that the U.S. Congress is likely to adopt legislation requiring that the negotiations in Geneva be expanded to include matters related to easing treaty-based restrictions on strategic missile defense systems. Again, this warning should be issued only if Russia raises the question of amending the ABM Treaty. Clinton should not raise the issue himself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should not be expanding the scope of the obsolete ABM Treaty to restrict theater missile defenses. There are four issues of importance relevant to the ABM Treaty. First, the U.S., Russia, and several other countries are involved in negotiations to establish a dividing line between shorter-range theater missile defenses, which are not subject to the restrictions of the ABM Treaty, and strategic missile defenses, which are subject to the treaty. Second, there is the question of designating a successor state or successor states to the Soviet Union under the ABM Treaty. Since the Soviet Union, not Russia, signed and is bound by the ABM Treaty, there is a question of which country or countries are legally bound under the treaty. Third, congressional leaders introduced a missile defense bill on March 21, 1996, which, among other things, would require the Clinton Administration to negotiate changes in the ABM Treaty to allow the deployment of an effective national missile defense system. Thus, the intent of Congress is to move beyond the ABM Treaty, not preserve it. And, finally, there is the matter of the legal form these agreements will take. It is becoming increasingly clear that Congress, and the Senate in particular, will object to agreements in these three areas if they do not take the form of formal amendments (protocols) to the ABM Treaty, which are subject to Senate advice and consent as required by Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Be prepared to issue a unilateral statement on START II, if the issue arises, to the effect that the U.S. will not agree to changes to the text of the treaty, or impose limitations on military systems not subject to the treaty.</b> If the Russians do not raise the this issue, then the U.S. should remain silent on the issue of START II. However, if pressed by the Russians, Clinton should inform Yeltsin that so long as no changes in the treaty text are demanded by Russia, the U.S. will proceed to formal ratification of the START II Treaty. On January 26, 1996, the United States Senate consented to the ratification of the START II Treaty. The treaty requires both Russia and the U.S. to reduce their strategic nuclear arsenals to 3,500 deliverable warheads on each side. However, the Russian Duma has not yet consented to ratification and there is speculation that it may not do so unless the U.S. agrees to concessions. These demands could come in the form of modifications to START II itself or restrictions on U.S. military systems outside the scope of the treaty, including new ABM Treaty restrictions on U.S. missile defense systems. The U.S. should steadfastly resist these demands, if they are made.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Be prepared to issue a unilateral statement, if the issue should arise, to the effect that the U.S. may want to re-negotiate the Chemical Weapons Convention.</b> If the issue of ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is raised during the Moscow summit, the U.S. should inform Russia that the U.S. Senate may not consent to the ratification of the CWC. Since the Russian Duma may not ratify the CWC either, the U.S. and Russia should consider drafting a joint request to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to re-negotiate the CWC. This unilateral statement should be issued only if the Russians raise the issue and should not be subject to further discussion.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should be seeking an alternative to the Chemical Weapons Convention. The U.S. Senate is now considering whether to consent to the ratification of the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The CWC requires all participating states (as of January 16, 160 states have signed the convention) not to develop, retain, deploy, or use chemical weapons. The CWC will enter into force when 65 countries ratify it. So far only 47 states have done so. Russia has signed the CWC as well.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The CWC does not serve U.S. interests. It undermines the U.S. chemical deterrent by barring America from retaining such weapons. Further, Russia has been dragging its feet on fully declaring the size of the chemical stock it inherited from the Soviet Union, as required by a 1989 understanding with the U.S. The best outcome for both the United States and Russia regarding the future of the CWC would be a new treaty modeled on the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This would designate the U.S. and Russia as weapons states and allow them to retain a chemical deterrent.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton must safeguard American national interests at the Russian summit and avoid compromises or concessions on important security issues. Above all, he must avoid being drawn into discussions on arms control. With the end of the Cold War and the diminished threat from the former Soviet Union, arms control need no longer occupy the central place it once held in the relationship between the two countries. There is no reason for side meetings or a bilateral engagement that goes beyond the stated purpose of the summit. If arms control issues are brought up by others, the President should limit himself to unilateral statements of the U.S. position. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is always inherent pressure at widely publicized international meetings to produce "breakthrough" agreements or some tangible results. If the results of the Moscow summit promise to be sparse, the President may be tempted to turn to arms control for an agreement which he can bring home as proof of his foreign policy prowess. In particular he may succumb to pressure to accept new ABM Treaty limitations on theater missile defenses. If this happens, the price of other benefits from the Moscow summit -- for example, an agreement on nuclear reactor safety  -- may prove too high. The American people have seen too many summits in which the vaunted results served merely to disguise unilateral concessions on arms control that harmed the nation's security.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The President must also be careful not to justify any agreement that emerges from the summit on the grounds that it will strengthen Boris Yeltsin. In fact, the President should not under any circumstances appear to interfere in Russia's electoral politics. Clinton should support Russian market and democratic reforms, not individual presidential candidates. He should welcome continuous integration of Russia into the international economic, investment, and information networks. He can acknowledge the pain of democratic and market reform, but call upon the Russian people to join the outside world from which they were separated by communist dictatorship for 70 years. By following this agenda in Moscow, President Clinton will be able to promote both U.S. national security and Russian democracy.

<title>No IMF Loans to Russia -- Heritage</title>

<h3>NO IMF LOANS TO RUSSIA</h3>
<a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen, Ph.D.</a><br> 
Senior Policy Analyst <br>
<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 447<br>
February 16, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is considering granting Russia a $9 billion loan, and the U.S.-run Export-Import Bank may provide an additional $1 billion to boost Russia's flagging civilian aircraft industry. President Bill Clinton strongly supports the IMF loan, hoping that it will bolster Boris Yeltsin's faltering presidency. But giving Russia a handout will not advance U.S. interests or help the Russian economy. The loans do not guarantee more responsible budgetary policies in Moscow. Nor do they lead to much-needed structural reforms, including agriculture and land privatization. Moreover, the loans do not secure Russia's peaceful conduct toward her neighbors, greater foreign policy cooperation with the U.S., or other American interests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Economic reforms in Russia are faltering. First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, the last remaining reformer in Yeltsin's cabinet, was forced to resign on January 16, 1996. He was sacrificed to appease Yeltsin's nationalist and communist critics. Now Yeltsin has left himself without any senior political figure capable of formulating and coordinating free-market reforms. Chubais's replacement, Vladimir Kadannikov, was the protectionist director of Russia's inefficient auto-making giant VAZ, whose low-quality products have long been the laughingstock of Europe. Kadannikov is hardly the economic policy leader to steer Russia to a stable free market.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A succession of young, reform-minded economists did much to shift the Russian economy to a free-market course over the past four years. Despite their efforts, Russia's economic house is still not in order. The inflation rate in 1995 was between 120 and 130 percent. Budget deficits are very high, and privatization has failed to raise the revenues to reduce them. Moreover, election campaign pressures have forced Yeltsin to break budgetary constraints and promise billions of dollars in credits and payments to industry groups with the strongest lobbying clout. For example, about $4 billion was earmarked for the defense industry for a state-directed conversion program, and $2.2 billion in wage arrears has been promised to workers in the state sector. The notoriously inefficient Russian miners, who went on strike in December 1995, were promised another $2 billion. $3.3 billion has been pledged to the agricultural sector. Half a billion dollars went to pensioners, and over $1 billion will be paid to officers and soldiers in the armed forces.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Instead of implementing a package of comprehensive economic reforms, attempting to balance the budget, and lowering taxes, the Russian government is following economic policies which only exacerbate the problems. These policies include:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Industrial subsidies.</b> Moscow is giving billions of dollars to inefficient state-owned enterprises. These include the military industry as well as agricultural machinery and aviation manufacturers.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Stalled land privatization and subsidies to the state-owned agricultural sector.</b> The pro-communist agrarian lobby succeeded in derailing the emergence of private farming. Despite its immense agricultural potential, Russia still needs food imports and still suffers from low agricultural productivity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Lack of military reform.</b> Russia's armed forces are oversized at 1.5 million servicemen. They also are poorly organized and inefficient, as demonstrated by their embarrassing performance in Chechnya. The armed forces need to be cut. Instead, the Ministry of Defense has demanded a 55 percent budget increase for FY 1996, and was granted a 16 percent real term increase by the state Duma.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Maintaining the bloated bureaucracy and state sector.</b> Russia today has more bureaucrats than the whole of the Soviet Union, which was almost twice as large. Moreover, many sectors of the Russian economy, such as health care, still are owned and operated by the state, which puts an additional drain on the federal budget.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Anti-investment policies.</b> More than $12 billion a year leaves Russia and is deposited in foreign bank accounts. Such capital flight denies the Russian economy investment and taxable income. According to the Russian Central Bank's Hard Currency Monitoring Department, over $4 billion a year is transferred illegally out of the country through fictitious import invoices alone. Why is this happening?  Because the government's economic policies are making Russia an inhospitable place to invest, especially compared to East Asia, Central Europe, Latin America, and other emerging markets. Instead of offering a handout to the Russian government, the IMF and the World Bank ought to provide policy advice to decrease the rates of taxation, boost the rule of law, and encourage investment in order to make the Russian economy more attractive for domestic and foreign entrepreneurs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Forgiving foreign debts.</b> While asking the IMF for loans, Moscow is forgiving an $8 billion debt owed by Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi, a $3 billion debt created by the Sandinista government of Nicaragua, and $250 million owed by Ethiopia. All these debts were generated when the Soviet Union was exporting the revolution and supplying Marxist regimes with weapons.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Russia's problems are not only economic. They are political as well. Russia may be on the brink of a takeover by unreformed communists led by Gennady Zyuganov, former ideology department chief of the Central Committee of the U.S.S.R. Communist Party. The irony is that this may be accomplished through the ballot box in the June presidential elections. Zyuganov, who is running first in the opinion polls, has promised to restore the U.S.S.R. "by voluntary means."  He is followed in the polls by ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has declared that he will restore the Russian Empire and possibly expand it even further into the Middle East.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; If a hard-liner like Zyuganov or Zhirinovsky were to win the presidential elections in June, IMF credits would be going to a retrograde regime with little or no interest in reform. Under these circumstances, IMF credits would be throwing good money after bad. Moreover, there is a chance that these loans would never be repaid, since under a communist government Russia could sever relations with the IMF and the World Bank.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Leading Yeltsin administration officials, such as Interior Minister General Anatoly Kulikov, and Communist deputies in the Duma are discussing how to reverse privatization and stop the economic reforms in their tracks. Communists and their allies control the majority of the Duma's committees and the powerful Duma Executive Council. Without a clearer picture of the future direction of Russian politics and economic policies, the IMF loans are ill-advised. It makes no sense to approve the IMF loan until the rest of the world knows what kind of regime will be using the money.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Nor does it make sense to loan Russia money while it is prosecuting the war against Chechnya. According to estimates by Russian economists, this war costs over $4.5 billion a year. The IMF should not subsidize such a war, or any other military ventures into which a future Russian hard-line president might drag the country.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Clinton Administration should not be lobbying the IMF on behalf of Russia. These loans will not boost the cause of reform. At best the money will be wasted; at worst, it could be abused by some future anti-Western leadership. Either way, money will be thrown at problems which cannot be solved easily and which will not go away with the stroke of an IMF pen.

<title>Who's Who in the 1995 Russian Elections -- Heritage</title>

<h3>WHO'S WHO IN THE 1995 RUSSIAN ELECTIONS</h3>

F.YI. No. 74<br>

December 4, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
On December 17, 1995, over 100,000,000 Russians are expected to go to the polls and vote for 450 members of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, or Federal Assembly. Half the members will be elected from winner-take-all single-mandate electoral districts.<sup>1</sup>  The other half will be elected from party lists in proportion to their total national vote, with 5 percent the minimum threshold for party representation. <p>Under the Russian constitution, the State Duma's power is limited in favor of the presidency. The Duma, therefore, has little say in formulating government policy. However, the upcoming election will reveal the balance of political forces in Russia, and its results will be difficult for President Boris Yeltsin and his administration to ignore. Moreover, some Russian experts view the parliamentary elections as a primary that will indicate popular support for candidates in the presidential election planned for June 1996. The Duma elections undoubtedly will have a significant impact on Russian policy, both foreign and domestic. 
<p>
According to the Russian Justice Ministry, 262 political parties have been registered, and by the end of September 1995, 63 electoral blocs and alliances had been recorded by the Central Electoral Commission. A large majority of the parties running for the State Duma are tiny, with no solid base of national support. By October 22, 1995, only 42 had managed to submit the 200,000 supporter signatures required in order to begin their electoral campaigns. Approximately 5,500 candidates are on the party lists, and 2,691 are running in the single-mandate constituencies.
<p>
Despite the number of parties in this race, the Russian public is largely indifferent. Feeling deceived by the politicians, people are disillusioned and openly skeptical about the value of the elections. Few voters study and compare party platforms, much less attend political rallies. Polls show that people would rather vote for well-known personalities, such as movie actors, military figures, and cultural icons. Almost all parties have such luminaries among the top three names on the party lists. In the top twelve electoral blocs alone, there are three actors and four generals.
<p>
Opinion polls also show that less than 39 percent of young people (ages 18-24) are going to vote, versus 71 percent in the 67-89 age group. The great strength of the communists is that their voters (primarily age 55 and older) have a high turnout rate. The Communist Party is highly motivated to return to power now, before its electoral base vanishes. With economic issues and populist and nationalist slogans dominating the rhetoric, and only a 25 percent turnout required, it is little wonder that the election results may favor the nationalist and leftist parties. 
<p>
Based on the latest public opinion polls, the expected results for those on the party lists are as follows:<P>
<ul>
<li> Communists, 10-15 percent;
<p>
<li> <i>Yabloko</i>, 10 percent;
<p>
<li> Women of Russia, 10 percent;
<p>
<li> Agrarian Party, 7-10 percent;
<p>
<li> Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (Zhirinovsky), 7 percent;
<p>
<li> Russia's Democratic Choice, 5-7 percent;
<p>
<li> Congress of Russian Communities--KRO (Lebed, Skokov), 5-7 percent.
</ul><p>

<b>PARTIES, PERSONALITIES, AND PROGRAMS</b>
<p>
What follows is a sketch of the main contenders in the coming electoral race. As the field is crowded, only those parties which currently appear most likely to exceed the 5 percent threshold of the national vote, or which have platforms of particular interest, are discussed.
<p>

<b>Russia's Democratic Choice-United Democrats</b>
<P>
Forecasts predict that Russia's Democratic Choice could get from 5 to 7 percent of the votes in December. This bloc strongly advocates freedom and democracy, private property, free-market economics, the rule of law, anti-inflationary and stabilization measures, and democratic military reform. Although it opposes Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's view that "the stage of liberal reforms is over," Russia's Democratic Choice generally supports the economic policies of the government.
<p>
Former First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, who heads the party in the Duma, is this bloc's leader. Internationally known human rights advocate Sergei Kovalev is in second place on the party's electoral list. Lydia Fedoseyeva-Shukshina, widow of writer and actor Vassily Shukshin, is in third place. The bloc includes a number of different parties:  Gaidar's Russia's Choice, with its nearly 60 regional chapters throughout Russia; the Social Democracy Party headed by Mikhail Gorbachev's chief ideologist, Alexander N. Yakovlev; and the Peasants' Party led by Federation Council (upper chamber of parliament) member Yuri Chernichenko. 
<p>
Russia's Democratic Choice finds itself in a difficult situation. The left-wing and nationalist opposition, as well as some government officials, attributes all failures of the reforms to Gaidar and his party. Gaidar has never openly distanced himself from the errors made by his government or by his successor, current Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin. Now his unwillingness to attack the government could cost him votes. His supporters are mainly young and middle-aged intellectuals and businessmen who have become unhappy with the government's overregulation and inability to protect them from crime and corruption. 
<p>

<b>Forward, Russia</b>
<p>
Duma member and former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov is first on the party list of Forward, Russia. Second comes Bella Denisenko, formerly a Russia's Choice activist and Deputy Health Minister, followed by Alexander Vladislavlev, a technocrat and former vice president of the centrist Civic Union under Arkady Volsky in 1993. Until he was removed recently by stockholders, Vladislavlev was the CEO of Moscow's failing ZIL automotive plant.
<P>
Fedorov is a constant critic of the government. He opposes new International Monetary Fund loans and credits to Russia, fearing that they will only increase Russia's already very high foreign debt. He favors tax reform, including a reduction in the tax burden, deep cuts in government spending, and downsizing of the federal bureaucracy. Private land ownership is one of Forward, Russia's top priorities.
<p>
Fedorov's stand on expanding NATO to include Eastern European countries such as Poland and Hungary is unique. He insists that Russia should announce its intention to join NATO because the West's response would indicate its true attitude. He also feels that NATO membership is needed to strengthen Russian democracy. Nevertheless, he is strongly opposed to the expansion of NATO without Russia.
<p>
Fedorov's movement is an "inside-the-Beltway" phenomenon, with little support in the Russian regions (<i>oblasts</i>). Some members have left and joined Chernomyrdin's pro-government Our Home Is Russia party. Fedorov lacks a team of prominent politicians and public personalities to ensure name recognition for his movement. The expectation is that he will find it difficult to attain the 5 percent of national votes required to attain seats in the Duma, although he is campaigning aggressively. 
<p>

<b><i>Yabloko</i> (Apple) </b>
<p>
The <i>Yabloko</i> bloc is named for its three founders:  Grigory Yavlinsky, Yuri Boldyrev, and Vladimir Lukin. In the fall of 1995 Boldyrev dropped out because of political differences with Yavlinsky and other members of the bloc. The <i>Yabloko</i> list today includes Duma Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Vladimir Lukin2 in second place, with Duma member Tatiana Yarygina in the number three slot. <p>The <i>Yabloko</i> bloc is headed by Grigory Yavlinsky. A relatively young, energetic, and extremely ambitious political contender, Yavlinsky is the most popular politician in Russia. His sole rival is General Alexander Lebed of the Congress of Russian Communities (KRO) movement. Unlike Gaidar and Fedorov, Yavlinsky was never a member of the reformist government which imposed so many unpopular measures on the population, and he never fails to criticize the government and its errors. His name is associated with the famous "500 Days" program of radical reform which was shelved by Gorbachev in 1990 under pressure from the orthodox communists. Because of this, Yavlinsky enjoys the image of a prophet shunned by his country. 
<p>
Yavlinsky claims that his party represents the interests of the middle class -- engineers, scientists, teachers, and qualified workers. These social strata have been losers under the reforms. His political platform is a combination of center-right and social-democratic slogans. On the one hand, he calls for private property and the protection of individuals against bureaucratic rule. On the other hand, he insists on increased government involvement in education and health. 
<p>
<i>Yabloko</i> committed some minor violations of the complicated regulations when submitting the party list to the Central Electoral Commission (as did many other electoral blocs) and was denied registration in November 1995. The case went to the Supreme Court, and the Commission's decision was reversed one week later, but not before the uproar had generated a great deal of publicity in <i>Yabloko</i>'s favor. Partly because of this publicity, the party's chances for success are high:  It could be the only democratic party to draw support in low double-digit figures. The question is how disciplined its voters will be on election day. In some single-mandate constituencies, other democratic parties have withdrawn their candidates in favor of <i>Yabloko</i> nominees.
<p>

<b>Democratic Russia-Free Trade Unions</b>
<p>
The Democratic Russia bloc was formed on the basis of Russia's oldest democratic organization, which emerged as an anti-Soviet and anti-communist entity in 1990. Its co-chairmen are Galina Starovoitova, former advisor to President Yeltsin, and Duma members Lev Ponomarev and Father Gleb Yakunin. Democratic Russia used to be part of Russia's Choice but left because of Gaidar's loyalty to the government. The party remains a stronghold of anti-communist and anti-totalitarian politicians, most of whom suffered during the Soviet regime as dissidents or prisoners of conscience.
<P>
Having failed to reach an electoral agreement with Yavlinsky or Gaidar, Democratic Russia is united in the campaign with the Russian Labor Confederation, which includes a dozen free trade unions and the Shield Military Union. The latter opposes the Defense Ministry's failing policies. The main objective of the bloc is "to awaken the electorate disillusioned by bureaucracy."  Its electoral campaign will focus on criticizing the neo-communist <i>nomenklatura</i> and its anti-popular economic policies and corruption. 
<p>
Democratic Russia ran into difficulties registering with the Central Electoral Commission and withdrew in the fall of 1995. On the national lists, the party has chosen to support <i>Yabloko</i>, but its leaders intend to run independently in the single-mandate constituencies.
<p>

<b>Economic Freedom Party</b>
<p>
Led by Konstantin Borovoy, one of the best-known entrepreneurs in Russia, this party's platform is based on the slogan "protecting investors' rights."  The party consistently champions free-market economics and deregulation and is openly anti-government. The Moscow regional list is headed by libertarian dissident Valeria Novodvorskaya, who was involved in anti-government activities in the former Soviet Union and was the only dissident detained during the "liberal" Gorbachev era. Borovoy's and Novodvorskaya's behavior and declarations, such as calling the current Russian government "fascist," often shock the public. Because it is primarily Moscow-based and has little support nationally, the Economic Freedom Party is unlikely to surpass the 5 percent threshold.
<p>

<b>CENTRIST PARTIES AND BLOCS</b>
<p>
<b>Our Home Is Russia (<i>Nash Dom Rossiya</i> -- NDR)</b>
<p> 
This bloc, headed by Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, was created on Yeltsin's initiative to provide an alternative to extremist forces on the left and right. It represents the interests of the post-Soviet <i>nomenklatura</i>, which is working to retain its political power and acquire wealth through privatization. Our Home Is Russia essentially represents Russia's current status quo and has much to lose if defeated. Virtually all government resources are at its disposal, and most ministers and local governors are members. 
<p>
This bloc favors further reforms but fails to follow a truly democratic pattern. Chernomyrdin openly advocates "strengthening the role of the government in the regulation of all spheres of Russian life."  He also suggests that the government tackle social problems. The NDR is determined to "fight the forces striving to undermine the constitutional basis of the state, abolish the presidency and redistribute property."
<p>
Chernomyrdin has chosen Nikita Mikhalkov, a popular movie actor, as number two on the NDR list. Number three is General Lev Rokhlin, commander of the Russian forces that captured Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, in February 1995. NDR lists are being formed in all of Russia's 89 regions. The government-run media are singing its praises, and the massive campaign is yielding results. Though formed only recently, the NDR is fourth in the polls at 12-15 percent, following the communists, <i>Yabloko</i>, and Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats.
<p>
The government is already taking costly populist steps, including wage hikes, subsidy increases, and unrestrained lending, to solidify the NDR's position for the upcoming elections. The party is gambling that the inevitable inflation caused by these measures will set in only after the elections.
<p>

<b>Ivan Rybkin's Electoral Bloc</b>
<p>
This bloc is headed by and named for Ivan Rybkin, Speaker of the State Duma and former head of the pro-Communist Agrarian Party (profiled below). Currently led by Ivan Lapshin, the Agrarians favor a strong state role in agriculture. Rybkin's bloc emerged as part of Yeltsin's attempt to create two broad, centrist parties within the existing establishment, one of which (the NDR) would be pro-government and the other of which would play the part of "loyal opposition."  However, it did not take long for federal and local officials and bureaucrats to grasp the advantages of Chernomyrdin's NDR. Therefore, most of them joined the NDR instead of Rybkin's bloc. Moreover, Rybkin's failure to be sufficiently critical of government policy cost him the support of his own Agrarian Party. 
<p>
Two small parties that had joined the bloc initially -- the United Industrial Party and the Federation of Independent Trade Unions -- left to run an independent campaign. Three top figures on Rybkin's initial party list -- Afghan War hero and former Deputy Defense Minister General Boris Gromov, well-known economist Stanislav Shatalin, and a popular singer named Yosif Kobzon -- also defected because of Rybkin's failure to oppose the government. 
<p>
Rybkin's platform is not captivating the electorate. It calls for social justice, law, order, creativity, and realism, mirroring the slogans of the NDR. However, Rybkin's charisma and perceived common sense could still attract the electorate to vote for him personally. His standing has been improving, partly because of mistakes by his opponents and partly because of his increased criticism of the government. However, despite recent gains, the question of whether Rybkin can make the 5 percent threshold remains open.
<p>

<b>THE LEFT</b>
<p>
<b>Communist Party of the Russian Federation</b>
<p>
The Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), headed by longtime Soviet Communist Party <i>apparatchik</i> Gennady Zyuganov, is one of the major anti-reformist forces in Russia. Its constituency is largely seniors who have suffered moral, political, and economic loss during the reform period. Their strong nostalgic sentiment and the lack of apparent prospects for a better future make them an active and well-organized force in contrast to the comparatively passive and irresolute democrats.
<p>
True to form, the communists are experts in manipulating public discontent with reform. They exaggerate the hardships, focus on the "humiliation of the nation," and predict "the extinction of the population."  The party platform calls for the de-nationalization of private property, direct government regulation of the economy, and restoration of the Soviet political system. It also advocates restoration of the Soviet Union and confrontation with the capitalist West. This movement undoubtedly represents an open threat to the nascent democracy in Russia, and even partial implementation of its goals could unleash social conflict. Few believe that the communists will fully re-nationalize the already privatized industries, but their effort to redistribute wealth could destabilize the political and economic situation.
<p>
Zyuganov's main partners in the CPRF are Svetlana Goryacheva, Yeltsin's bellicose opponent in the former Russian Supreme Soviet, and Aman Tuleyev, a regional boss from Kemerovo and Yeltsin's opponent in the 1991 presidential election. Among other well-known figures on the list are August 1991 coup leaders Anatoly Lukyanov, the former USSR Supreme Soviet Speaker, and Victor Ilyukhin, Chairman of the Duma Security Committee and a former prosecutor who once charged Mikhail Gorbachev with "high treason" for dismantling the Soviet state.
<p>

<b>Other Communist Groups</b>
<p>
The CPRF is not the only communist organization running for the Duma. Others have coalesced into a radical communist bloc called Communists-Working Russia-for the Soviet Union, which expects to attract voters positioned to the left of Zyuganov and pledges an even stronger commitment to restoring the communist system. Zyuganov is not expected to carry large cities like Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Ekaterinburg because of strong support for reformers in these cities. However, the CPRF should enjoy greater support in smaller cities and towns in the so-called red belt south and east of Moscow. The nationwide network of local party chapters which remained virtually intact after the collapse of the CPSU constitutes an unsurpassed political machine. This represents a significant electoral advantage for the communists, who are expected to get up to 15 percent of the vote.
<p>

<b>Agrarian Party</b>
<p>
The Agrarian Party is headed by Ivan Lapshin, Chairman of its Duma faction and director of the Lenin's Legacy state farm (<i>sovkhoz</i>) on the outskirts of Moscow. The party's political slogans and electoral base are much the same as those of the communists:  pensioners, state farm managers and workers, and members of collective farms. Since agricultural reform has been slow and timid, the system remains essentially as it was under the totalitarian regime:  dominated by all-powerful collective farm chairmen at the expense of poor peasants. Most collective farms supposedly have been reshaped into "joint-stock companies," but these companies are a fiction. In fact, there is virtually no private farmland, and the few private farmers that exist are harassed and persecuted by the rural communist networks.
<p>
The Agrarians criticize the present regime as "anti-popular, anti-national and anti-peasant."  Granting people private ownership of land is, in Lapshin's words, "a diabolic enterprise which will ruin the social and economic stability of the country."  Regarding the communists as their closest allies, the Agrarians also call for restoring the power of the Soviets and restoring the USSR. In addition, they demand that the agrarian sector be made a top priority in national economic policy. 
<p>
The party's electoral list is one of the largest in Russia:  437 names, of which 270 are on the federal list and 167 intend to run in single-mandate constituencies. The Agrarians have a stable electorate in the countryside which is easily controlled. A local Agrarian boss can make life unbearable for those who dare challenge the party in the elections. Thus, a 5 percent vote is virtually guaranteed. However, the party has a much slimmer chance in the cities, where nearly 70 percent of the Russian population lives. All in all, the Agrarians could gather up to 10 percent of the votes in the Duma elections.

<p>
<b>THE NATIONALISTS</b>
<p>
Russian nationalist parties that favor a strong state and a return to an imperialist system occupy a broad space in the political spectrum.
<p>
<b>Liberal Democratic Party of Russia</b>
<p>
The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) is headed by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the party's Duma faction and a lawyer with strong intelligence community connections. The LDPR's platform is based largely on the ideas of Russian chauvinism, which have become widespread in the wake of the Soviet breakup. Zhirinovsky manipulates the Russian people by evoking xenophobic sentiment, anti-Semitism, and racial hatred for non-Russians such as Azerbaijanis, Chechens, and Uzbeks. His electorate is comprised of those unable to advance either in the old Soviet Union or under the current system:  the unemployed, unqualified workers, and retired and acting military officers. Zhirinovsky also attracts the rank and file in the armed forces, members of the military-industrial complex, and elements of the Russian "mafiya" who applaud his anti-Western declarations and defiance.
<p>
Though Zhirinovsky is not opposed to private property in principle, some redistribution in favor of his supporters undoubtedly would take place if he came to power. Therefore, some influential economic forces in the country, anxious to capitalize on this redistribution, covertly support the LDPR while openly supporting other parties. Fearing expropriation, many Russian businessmen wish to "diversify the risk" of doing business in Russia.
<p>
Zhirinovsky's popularity, however, is faltering. Some of his slogans and rhetoric have been taken up by the present government and by his nationalist competitors. His electorate is unpredictable, although he could still do well among soldiers who vote under the tight control of the many officers who share Zhirinovsky's views. Since the nationalist leader supports increases in the defense budget, the Army continuously flirts with him; Defense Minister Pavel Grachev even promoted him to Lieutenant-Colonel in the reserves -- two ranks higher than the rank of captain he used to hold.
<p>
The LDPR will easily make the 5 percent level, but it will not get the 30 percent which Zhirinovsky has predicted. A more likely figure is 7 percent. If he gets over 15 percent, Zhirinovsky will likely throw his hat into the ring in next June's presidential election.
<p>

<b>Congress of Russian Communities (KRO)</b>
<p>
The Congress of Russian Communities is headed by Yuri Skokov, former Yeltsin ally, former National Security Council Secretary, and a military-industrial chieftain. However, Skokov is not the most popular and charismatic figure in the KRO. Much more popular is retired General Alexander Lebed, former commanding officer of the 14th Army and number two on the party list. Lebed was the most popular Russian politician during the summer months.<sup>3</sup>  The third spot, behind Lebed and Skokov, is occupied by Sergei Glaziev, an archopponent of the current regime and protectionist foe of free-market reforms who advocates stronger government involvement in the economy.<p>The Congress of Russian Communities calls for countering centrifugal and separatist trends in Russia and for protecting the Russian minorities in the so-called Near Abroad. However, its support base seems to be more concentrated abroad than in Russia proper. Skokov, an uncharismatic Soviet-era technocrat, is not very popular. His support comes mainly from the ranks of the military. Lebed presents himself as an honest man with a "law and order" message, but many intellectuals abhor his rude manners. Both Skokov and Lebed, however, could rally the support of rank-and-file officers and the military-industrial complex. It is expected that the Congress of Russian Communities will make 5 percent in the elections.
<p>
<b><i>Derzhava</i> (Great Power) Movement</b>
<p>
The Congress of Russian Communities is being challenged by the <i>Derzhava</i> (Great Power) Movement headed by Alexander Rutskoy, former deputy to Yeltsin and one of the October 1993 mutiny leaders. Rutskoy can expect some support from the officer corps since he is a veteran and an Afghan War hero. Evoking memories of Russia's imperial and religious past, he calls for "a restoration of Holy Russia as a Unitarian state in its natural borders," implying the pre-World War I borders of czarist Russia. 
<p>
Rutskoy accepted two defectors from Zhirinovsky's party and found them places on his own list. His number two man, chief campaign organizer Victor Kobelev, is one of these. Third on the list is Konstantin Dushenov, former spokesman for the famous ultra-nationalist Bishop Ioann (John) of Kronstadt and the Ladoga, in the St. Petersburg region. To boost fund-raising, Rutskoy also has put some "New Russian" businessmen on his party list. This policy evoked a wave of protests from veterans of the nationalist movement, who accused Rutskoy of staging an "anti-patriotic coup" and of turning the party into a "social-criminal movement."  Their subsequent withdrawal from the party left Rutskoy weakened. 
<p>
Like <i>Yabloko, Derzhava</i> was denied registration by the Central Electoral Commission, but the Supreme Court has overturned that ruling. Rutskoy's group is among those that are unlikely to clear the 5 percent hurdle.
<p>

<b>Union of Patriots</b>
<p>
Another nationalist bloc with the slogan of "protecting the Russian man" is the Union of Patriots. Formed on the basis of the Russian National <i>Sobor</i> (Union) organization and headed by ex-KGB General Alexander Sterligov, this bloc also includes two of the August 1991 coup instigators, industrial manager Alexander Tizyakov and Army General Valentin Varennikov. Russian National <i>Sobor</i> supporters include devout Russian Orthodox believers and paramilitary Cossacks, as well as the military-industrial complex. The bloc probably will not achieve the 5 percent threshold.
<p>

<b>For the Motherland</b>
<p>
Nationalist-oriented Afghan War veterans and some trade unions are backing yet another nationalist opposition bloc, For the Motherland, headed by Vladimir Polevanov. Vice-premier and Privatization Minister for Yeltsin for six months in 1994-1995, Polevanov was dismissed for opposing the government's privatization policy. Second in the party ranks is Commander in Chief of Airborne Troops Evgueni Podkolzin, who enjoys the respect of the military and has criticized the Defense Ministry for its poor handling of the Chechen campaign. Famous ice-hockey goal-keeper Vladislav Tretyak is also high on the party list, but his presence is unlikely to give For the Motherland the capacity to surmount the 5 percent hurdle.

<p>
<b>SPECIAL-INTEREST ELECTORAL BLOCS</b>
<p>

<b>Women of Russia</b>
<p>
The Women of Russia movement is headed by Alevtina Fedulova, Deputy Speaker of the current Duma, longtime communist, and <i>Komsomol</i> (Young Communist League) <i>apparatchik</i>; Yekaterina Lakhova, leader of the party's faction in the Duma and advisor to the president on family issues; and Galina Klimantova, chairman of the Duma Women, Family and Youth Issues Committee. The movement claims to represent specific women's interests, focusing on welfare issues, improving women's social status, and anti-discriminatory employment measures. Such slogans are likely to attract some of the female electorate and may give the movement the 5 percent of votes it needs to get into the Duma. 
<P>
On many economic and political issues, Women of Russia is close to the communists and Agrarians. However, its voting record in the Duma has not been as close to that of the communists as many had expected. The movement has about 80 candidates on the federal list and over 20 in the single-mandate districts.
<p>

<b>Environmental Protection Party of Russia</b>
<p>
The Environmental Protection Party of Russia (KEDR/Cedar) is an ecological movement. Popular TV anchorman Leonid Yakubovich, prominent businessman Artem Tarasov, writer and <i>Novy Mir</i> literary journal chief editor Sergei Zalygin, and cosmonaut Musa Manarov top the party's list. KEDR/Cedar unites 40 environmental movements and has 224 candidates on its federal list and 115 in the single-mandate districts. However, its chances to make the 5 percent threshold are slim.
<p>

<b>Trade Unions and Industrialists of Russia-Union of Labor</b>
<p>
Trade Unions and Industrialists of Russia-Union of Labor was formed by former components of the Rybkin bloc -- the Russian United Industrial Party of Vladimir Shcherbakov, Mikhail Shmakov's Federation of Independent Trade Unions, and Arkady Volsky's Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. This group pledges to "revive domestic industries, insure high employment, obey the law, ease ethnic tensions and revitalize the Russian state."  Similar to Volsky's Civic Union back in the 1993 elections, however, it is not likely to make the 5 percent threshold.
<p>
<b>Others</b>
<p>
Electoral blocs based on specific interests include such associations as the Beer Lovers' Party, Christian-Democratic Union-Russian Christians, the Protection of the Disabled Party, the Lawyers' Association, the Pensioner Protection Party and its bloc, and the "Nur" Moslem Movement. Although each of these parties succeeded in obtaining the 200,000 signatures needed to begin a campaign, the 5 percent threshold may be an insurmountable barrier. Their expectations probably can be realized only in single-mandate constituencies where some of their famous leaders are candidates.
<p>
The role of the military in the upcoming election deserves special attention. Although the armed forces cannot submit a party list, there are over 100 active duty officers on various party lists and running in single-mandate constituencies. Defense Minister Grachev has openly encouraged the political involvement of the officer corps, including running for office in uniform, in the hope they will lobby for military interests in the new Duma. Grachev put his Deputy Chief of the General Staff, three-star Colonel-General Anatoly Bogdanov, in charge of this operation. Some military units reportedly have deployed their own TV studios to advertise their commanders' campaigns.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
With the exception of the communists, no electoral bloc will win more than 10-12 percent of the Duma seats. Presidential analyst Marc Urnov forecasts that only the Communist Party, the Agrarians, Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats, <I>Yabloko</i>, Our Home Is Russia, and the Congress of Russian Communities will be able to clear the 5 percent hurdle. The Duma will be split into a multitude of minor factions cooperating or confronting each other on each individual issue.
<p>
<b>Ascendancy of the Nationalists and Leftists.</b>  A shift toward the leftist and nationalist parties is widely predicted. A pronounced nationalist-leftist orientation in the Duma could trigger attempts to revise the existing constitution. The Duma may wish to curtail the powers of the president and enhance its own. Under these circumstances, the president would likely veto almost all laws passed by the Duma. (So far, only 20 percent of passed legislation has been rejected.) The upshot would be a return to the confrontation and crisis that resulted in the storming of the old Russian Parliament in 1993.
<p>
<b>Unpleasant Surprises.</b> Particularly dangerous is the possibility of increased criminal power in the Duma. According to some estimates by the Interior Ministry, 25 to 30 percent of the newly elected members will be influenced by criminal organizations, either openly or covertly. If true, these delegates would use their power to entrench criminal groups even further in Russian society. These corrupt deputies could become a ruling majority in the Duma regardless of party affiliation.
<P>
The possibility of postponement or annulment of the election by the president cannot be excluded. A violent extremist action could serve as the pretext for such action. Certain forces in Yeltsin's inner circle are determined to preserve their own position by preventing a new Duma from coming to power. A low turnout at the elections (less than 25 percent of eligible voters) also might provide a legal basis for declaring the December elections invalid and governing without the Duma. 
<p>
As the elections draw near, attempts on the part of potential losers to delay them or change the rules of the game are becoming more pronounced. Loopholes in the electoral legislation are the main pretext for such disruptions. For example, a large group of Duma deputies has requested the Constitutional Court to examine the 5 percent threshold rule and other issues, but were rebuffed by the Court. All major parties oppose any last-minute revision of the electoral legislation and are very much against postponing the elections. 
<p>
Technical issues, such as where a party is placed on the ballot, are also important. The drawing of lots which took place November 10, 1995, for example, gave first place to Women of Russia and second to Rutskoy's <i>Derzhava</i>. This puts them at an advantage, as most people tend to vote for familiar candidates whose name first meets the eye.
<p>
The United States has little ability to influence the outcome of this election. Nevertheless, the American government, including Congress, should continue sending a clear message to the Russian political elite and public that it supports Russia's advance to democracy and a free-market economy. The U.S. also should make it clear that a significant communist or nationalist gain could undermine the progress of reform in Russia and imperil international stability and security. To assuage some Russian fears, the U.S. should emphasize once again that potential NATO expansion is targeted not against Russia or its people, but against extremist forces that could usurp power. 
<P>
Observers should watch for fraud and doctoring of election results. American and other Western observers might contribute by helping to ensure fair play. However, some Russian experts believe that Western observers could be duped into endorsing a "stolen" election. Observers will be concentrated mainly in the big cities, where public opinion tends to be democratically oriented and fraud would be opposed. Meanwhile, villages and small towns, where it is easier to tamper with ballots, will not be watched closely by outsiders. It is no accident that the communists, the Agrarians, and Zhirinovsky's faction blocked the Duma's adoption of a bill on public supervision of the elections. Major fraud also could be committed not at polling stations, but later, when the votes are being counted.
<P>
Whatever occurs at the polls in Russia in December, one thing is certain:  These elections are a critical test for Russian democracy. They also are a dress rehearsal for the even more important presidential elections which will take place in Russia in June.

<html><title>Messages Clinton Should Deliver At the U.S.-Russian Summit -- heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>MESSAGES CLINTON SHOULD DELIVER AT THE U.S.-RUSSIAN SUMMIT</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen, Ph.D. </a><br>
Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 435<br>
October 23, 1995<br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center>
<p>
President Bill Clinton is planning a positive, "feel-good" summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on October 23, 1995, in New York City. This event takes place as an intense parliamentary campaign is underway in Russia which ultimately may cast a shadow over Boris Yeltsin's political future and imperil U.S.-Russian relations. Popular support for Russian nationalist leader General Alexander Lebed and the recent Communist victory in the Volgograd local elections indicate that the tide of Russian political opinion may be turning against Boris Yeltsin.
<p>
U.S.-Russian relations are too important to waste on a "feel-good" summit. The President needs to be preparing the ground for what could be a challenging period in U.S.-Russian relations. He needs to get down to business, not only dealing with such issues as Bosnia and NATO expansion, but positioning the U.S. for a time when Boris Yeltsin may no longer be president of Russia.
<p>
<b>America's Russian Challenge.</b> Russia's recent outcry over the NATO bombings in Bosnia exposed a former superpower in search of an identity and led by an increasingly combative political establishment. Russia's foreign policy is becoming more anti-Western, as evidenced by the opposition to NATO enlargement, the planned sales of nuclear reactors to Iran, and threats to breach the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty. Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has been weakened by intrigues and is about to be dismissed by President Yeltsin. Suspicion of the West is growing in Moscow. Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, presidential foreign policy advisor Dmitrii Ryurikov, General Evgenii Primakov, head of the foreign intelligence service, and General Alexander Korzhakov, ubiquitous Chief of the Kremlin guard, all tend to be anti-Western and against reform. They also are in positions of major influence over Yeltsin's foreign and security policies. 	
<p>
<b>Yeltsin's Political Weakness.</b> Yeltsin's internal position is precarious. His public approval ratings hover between 9 and 15 percent, and his chances of winning a presidential bid do not look bright. The polls consistently show that several Russian politicians, such as Lebed and Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the YABLOCo party, would be able to defeat him in an election. Two "centrist" parties were launched in May:  Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin's Our Home Russia and Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin's Accord. The first is polling around 10 percent, and the second has yet to get off the ground. According to high-level Russian sources, some in Yeltsin's circle are considering canceling the presidential elections altogether. Thus, Yeltsin and his team could be swept away by a cadre of anti-Western nationalists if the presidential elections slated for the summer of 1996 actually take place. Alternatively, Yeltsin could be rendered more prone to a coup if he fails to hold the elections and undermines his remaining legitimacy. 
<p>
President Clinton needs to take stock of the new winds blowing in Russia. He must prepare U.S. policy for the likelihood that Russia may be on the verge of a major political crisis. At the New York summit, the President should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Support democracy and free-market principles rather than particular Russian leaders.</b> Clinton's unwavering support of Yeltsin, particularly in the wake of the October 1993 attack on the Russian Supreme Soviet and the Chechnya operation, have already cost the U.S. a great deal of goodwill among both Russian nationalists and reformers. The chances are good that Clinton or the next American President will have to deal with a new set of players in Moscow. The U.S. cannot afford to appear partisan. Clinton should be firm in expressing American support for democracy, elections, free markets, and individual rights in Russia. He should play down his support for the personal political fortunes of Boris Yeltsin.
<p>
<li><b>Proceed with caution in bringing Russian peacekeepers to Bosnia.</b> While the U.S. should support a sustainable, long-term peace settlement in Bosnia, it is too early to negotiate the specific details of Russia's military involvement in a peacekeeping operation. Nevertheless, President Clinton should declare that, in principle, the Russian armed forces will be welcome to support peace in Yugoslavia, but only if American troops are committed to the peacekeeping mission.1  Clinton should be careful not to jeopardize NATO's operational control over the entire peacekeeping mission. Russian troops could play a positive role in such important tasks as mine-sweeping, logistics, and communications. In these areas, the Russian military could cooperate with its NATO counterparts. However, Clinton should not agree to integrating Russian troops into the NATO command and control structure. This leaves open the possibility of a Russian "occupation sector" inside Bosnian Serb territory. The presence of Russian troops on the ground could prevent further NATO air strikes in the event the peace treaty collapses. 
<p>
<li><b>Reaffirm that NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia.</b> Many in Moscow are expressing deep concern about NATO expansion. The summit is a good opportunity for President Clinton to make clear to Boris Yeltsin and the Russian people that the North Atlantic alliance harbors no hostile intentions toward them. While NATO enlargement will occur, Russian participation in the Partnership for Peace and Moscow's dialogue with Brussels should be expanded simultaneously. NATO enlargement will expand the zone of peace and stability in Europe. Such a zone is in the interests not only of Europe, but of Russia, Belarus, and other countries of the former Soviet Union as well. 
<p>
<li><b>Oppose a unilateral breach of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty.</b> The Russian military is threatening a unilateral breach of the CFE treaty. Specifically, Moscow insists on reviewing upwards the limits it imposes on the number of tanks and cannon permitted on the ground. President Clinton should oppose such an asymmetrical approach. These issues can be renegotiated within the framework of the treaty. If Russia remains determined to deploy more treaty-limited equipment on its southern flank, then the U.S. should seek a <i>quid pro quo</i> -- relief from the 1972 ABM Treaty, which is impeding the U.S. ballistic missile defense program.

<li><b>Offer incentives to cancel the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran.</b> The radical regime in Tehran has launched a bid to acquire nuclear weapons and has ordered two nuclear reactors from Russia. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not support this sale, which could endanger both Russian and Western security. The deal is being promoted by the powerful atomic industry ministry (Minatom) and its chief, Viktor Mikhailov. Iran, with its formidable oil and gas resources, does not need nuclear power. If Tehran wants an additional source of electricity, Russia could sell electrical power from its own ample resources. In addition, to compensate Russia for the lost reactor sales, the U.S. could increase its Russian uranium import quota or cooperate in building safer nuclear reactors on Russian soil.
<p></ul>
This is not the time for a "feel-good" summit with the Russians. Although the President's time with Boris Yeltsin is limited, he has enough time to deliver some important messages, not only to Yeltsin, but to all of Russia and the world. The U.S. is still committed to democracy in Russia, but that cause no longer has a single human face. At the New York summit, President Clinton should be looking ahead, preparing the ground for what may well be a rocky road in future U.S.-Russian relations.

Book Review: Martin Malia: The Soviet Tragedy
 -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<h2>August <i>Insider</i> -- In Focus: Book Review</h2>
<I> by <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=8047423027+0+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve">Elizabeth Edwards Spalding</a></i>

<b>
The Soviet Tragedy: A History of Socialism in Russia, 1917-1991<br>
Martin Malia (New York: The Free Press, 1994)</b>
<p>
While good books on American history and domestic politics continue to multiply, the same cannot be said of international politics and American foreign policy. For those who are interested in the central conflict of the twentieth century -- the Cold War -- there is good news in the form of Martin Malia's The Soviet Tragedy. A respected, former professor of history at Berkeley, Malia may be best known as Z, the author who exposed the distortions of revisionist Sovietologists and analyzed the potential for the crumbling of the Soviet regime in his 1990 article "To the Stalin Mausoleum." Now Malia offers a masterful study of Western Sovietology and its translations of the Soviet regime and its practices.
<p>
Two models have dominated the field of Soviet studies: first, the totalitarian school that was pioneered in the 1950s, which argued that the Bolshevik revolution was communist and imposed in fact by an intellectual elite and that Lenin and Stalin established and extended a totalitarian state; second, the anti-totalitarian school, which, as it gained momentum in the 1960s and 1970s, maintained that pluralism, consensus building, and compromise characterized the Soviet Union, Lenin, and Stalin's successors. The revisionist anti-totalitarian model has influenced several generations of scholars, students, journalists, and policymakers, many of whom continue to contend that the Cold War ended with Stalin or, certainly, under Khrushchev. They foresaw and generally applauded a convergence between democracy and socialism, and they adduced détente under Brezhnev as evidence. In this view, Ronald Reagan caused a second Cold War, and Mikhail Gorbachev deserved every accolade as man of the decade. Noteworthy exceptions to revisionism --such as Robert Conquest, Richard Pipes, and Malia-- constitute a pilloried minority.<P255D>
<p>
According to Malia, the totalitarian model is more correct than the anti-totalitarian model. To qualify as a totalitarian dictatorship, the classic definition requires an elaborate ideology, a single mass party, terror, a technologically conditioned monopoly of communication, a monopoly of weapons, and a centrally controlled economy. Malia never disputes the totalitarian nature of the Soviet system. But he qualifies his approval of the totalitarian model, since the rigidity of this model does not explain well "the obvious mellowing of the Soviet system in the decades after Stalin's death."
<p>
Malia suggests that Eastern European intellectuals, such as Poland's Adam Michnik, and other survivors of communism supply the deficiencies of the totalitarian model. Eastern Europeans applied totalitarian to a regime in which total control was the basic aspiration, while realizing that such a regime did not have to (and could not) exercise total control over its population. Explains Malia: "It did not mean that such regimes were omnipotent in performance, but rather that they were omnicompetent in their institutional structure. In short, it was not Soviet society that was totalitarian; rather, it was the Soviet state." While seeing the whole of the totalitarian objective, it is possible to distinguish between the "high totalitarianism" of Stalin and the routine totalitarianism of Brezhnev.
<p>
Malia imparts a lucid history of Soviet domestic and foreign policies, which is especially detailed where newly released information bolsters his argument. Throughout his discussion, he threads a sophisticated analysis of the Hegelian and Marxist foundations to socialism. Academic or not, readers will benefit particularly from his assessments of 1939-1953, 1982-1988, and 1989-1991. Unlike most other Western Sovietologists, Malia grasps that the Cold War began in 1917, that the Soviet Union made great gains during World War II, and that the East-West conflict then hardened in the postwar era. He also verifies the impact of Reagan's policies on the USSR, including SDI as a "technological and economic challenge the Soviets could neither ignore nor match." To explain the death throws of the USSR, Malia draws the important distinction between the profound and proximate causes of the great crash of 1989-1991. He does not make the mistake of attributing the demise of the USSR only to internal economic factors; rather, he assays that economic decline and its discrediting of ideology are the most important proximate causes. It is crucial to see these proximate causes of the Soviet collapse as "parts of a pattern arising from the nature of that system itself." As Malia concludes, socialism was founded on the profound Myth of radical egalitarianism and then transformed into the Lie: "In sum, there is no such thing as socialism, and the Soviet Union built it."
<p>
For those not embroiled in the ongoing academic warfare over the Cold War, Malia's points may seem manifest. The documents that are now available vindicate his position. To date, however, Malia's book --with its combined understanding of the Soviet regime and its practices, its rise and fall, and its interpreters—is unique in the study of the Cold War.

<center><h2>

CORRUPTION IN RUSSIA: 

NO DEMOCRACY WITHOUT MORALITY</h2><br>



<h3>By Barbara von der Heydt1</h3>
</center><p>
Corruption threatens to strangle the new democracy of the former Soviet Union in its infancy. <i>Glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika</i> have been replaced by <i>naglost</i> (brazen insolence) and <i>perestrelka</i> (shootouts). Whether order based on both freedom and responsibility can emerge from the rubble of collapsed communism is an open question. There is no rule of law, no clear definition of property rights, no genuine democracy or market economy for most of the newly freed peoples. 

<p>

Criminal elements have joined forces with the corrupt bureaucrats of the old guard to form networks of collusion. The old <i>nomenklatura</i> still have a chokehold on the country; they may have new business cards, but they are still in power.2  Corruption extends from the police through the courts, into the highest levels of the present government, confirms Alexander Gurov, director of a security research institute at the Ministry of Security, formerly the KGB. "Before, the criminals tried to influence officials with bribes," says Gurov. "Today they already have their own lobby in the government and the parliament -- not to mention the police and the prosecutor's office."3
<p>
Duma experts have issued a report estimating that 25 to 30 percent of the members who will be elected to the parliament in the coming December elections will represent influence of the criminal structures, either openly or covertly, and will be a significant force capable of influencing policy decisions to benefit the mafia.4  No real economic or political force is capable of implementing an anti-corruption campaign, because it is increasingly difficult either to do business without encountering illegal or corrupt practices or to get elected without the money they produce.

<p>

What Russians call the <i>mafiya</i> is a generic term encompassing organized crime, although it is not one organization under a "godfather."  Those operating in the shadow economy are outside the boundaries of legality, but there are varying shades of gray. Not all of those outside the law are involved in extracting or paying protection money. 

<p>



<b>A Moral Vacuum</b>

<p>

The explosion of criminality, corruption, and mafia activity is evidence of a moral crisis of major dimensions. When communism collapsed, it left behind the legacy of a moral vacuum, claim many Russians. What fills this vacuum will determine the future of Russia. Even though half the Russian populace lives in poverty today, the moral needs are even more acute than the economic ones. As economist and former St. Petersburg legislator Mikhail Dmitriev observed, "The economic problems are not a crisis. Give us ten years and we'll be a normal country. But the moral crisis is far more serious."5
<p>
The Communist Party and its ideology of Marxism-Leninism were the source of collective moral authority. Now that the ideology has been rejected, its subjects are cut free of any moral mooring. Russians characterize the result as total disorientation. Alexander Zaichenko, former economic advisor to Mikhail Gorbachev, describes the lingering socialist malaise as "collective responsibility and individual irresponsibility."6  Under the communist regime, "There was a strict but hypocritical code of behavior," claims Evgueni Volk of the Heritage Foundation's Moscow office. "Everyone knew what he was eligible to steal."7  Now there is "freedom with neither responsibility nor morality," says Alexander Mitroshenkov, editor of Poesk.8 
<p>
The result is visible in Russia's prisons, where detainees wait for a trial in cells so overcrowded that they can sleep, sit, or stand only in shifts. The Deputy Director of the Russian Federal Prison System, Valery Orlov, reflects on the explosion of criminality:  "In a law-abiding person, there is something holy left. If it is absent, he turns to robbery, crime, violence, and murder, mainly for material gain. Such a person doesn't feel responsible for his own actions."9

<p>
<b>Communism's Poisonous Legacy</b><p>
Alexander Solzhenitsyn claims that the communist system was deforming, destroying the personality to make it governable. The legacy of communism is the poison left in its former subjects. Vaclav Havel, in his New Year's address in 1990, made the diagnosis:  "We have become morally ill because we have become accustomed to saying one thing and thinking another."  The children of communism learned to speak one way among family and closest friends, and another way outside the inner circle. The result is "moral schizophrenia." 

<p>

In the introduction to <i>Remaking Russia</i>, an intriguing collection of contemporary thought from Russia's leading publicists and scholars, Richard Pipes writes, "[I]t can be argued that Russia's gravest problems are not economic.... Communism's most ruinous legacy lies in the moral and psychological sphere:  economic failures appear as a consequence rather than cause of Russia's current predicament."10 
<p>
Mikhail Dmitriev diagnoses the traits in his own nation:  "The legacy of totalitarianism in human character is a combination of personal irresponsibility and aggression. Everything was decided from above, and there was no risk-taking. Now the people are not capable of combining risk-taking and responsibility." 

<p>

Russian writer Fazil Iskander claims, "The transition from a rather enduring totalitarian regime to democracy has brought unimaginable psychological difficulties along with it. Under a totalitarian regime, it was as if you were forced to live in the same room with a violently insane man.... Many people in Russia have been gripped by anguish, rage, and an all-encompassing suspiciousness."11 
<p>
People who had reason not to trust under the old regime find it hard to do so today. Those who were absolved of responsibility before often find it a burden now. People denied the opportunity to make decisions earlier are paralyzed now when they must decide; socialism bred passivity and penalized personal initiative. People who have never lived in an open society have little practice in resolving conflicts peacefully. The ideology which preached hatred and class struggle sowed seeds of strife, suspicion, and confrontation. If there are no moral boundaries from within, and no external limits, all things are permitted. Those who lived in what Solzhenitsyn called the "culture of the lie" find it hard to live transparent lives in harmony with truth.12   
<p>
Among the most alarming symptoms of sickness are those in young people. Young Russians were asked last year what professions they would like to pursue. A majority answered they would prefer racketeering and prostitution because they could "earn hard currency, travel and meet people."  In a poll of Russian children this spring, they were asked what would prevent them from stealing. Of 100, 99 answered they would be afraid of getting caught. One said he would not steal because it is wrong.

<p>



<b>Democracy Is Not Enough</b>

<p>

	In the absence of internal law of the human heart, no laws of a state can create good citizens or a good society. As Edmund Burke observed, those who are not governed from within must be governed from without. In the absence of moral renewal in Russia, the institutions of democracy and a market economy cannot take root and flourish. Corruption will choke them. Democratic institutions are value neutral and no guarantee of wise or moral policy. They must be filled by the character of a nation. Sociologist Mikhail Tarusin makes the crucial point: 

<blockquote>

	Democracy is only an outward form, which can be used for good or evil. Hitler came to power democratically, and so could Zhirinovsky. .. .. .. If we don't have the moral tradition, we have no future.13 
</blockquote>
No sustained period in the history of Russia has permitted ownership of private property and fostered the responsibility to manage it or one's life autonomously. Neither a reliable framework of laws nor the moral foundations of a market economy and democracy are evident in Russian culture today, although brief flowerings are to be found in the country's history.
<p>
In <i>Remaking Russia</i>, Vyacheslav Ivanov asserts, "What is lacking above all is the legal, ethical, and psychological basis necessary to establish new market relations. Without fundamental change, the feeling of instability, giving rise to fraud and frustration, will persist."14  As the chaos increases, so do the calls for a "strongman" to impose order.

<p>
<b>Deadly Consequences of Corruption </b>
<p>
Evidence of corruption and collaboration with organized crime abounds. According to a report prepared for Boris Yeltsin by the Analytical Center for Social and Economic Policies, three quarters of Russia's private enterprises pay 10 percent to 20 percent of what they earn to criminal organizations.15  Some 40,000 state and privately run companies, including most of the country's banks, are controlled by 150 criminal syndicates.16  Altogether there are as many as 3,000 to 5,000 gangs.17  Known generically as the <i>mafiya</i>, these interlocking bands of organized crime exercise control over their own specific regions of a given city, a region of the country, and a segment of the economy. Some specialize in forging documents, others in drug and weapons trafficking, illegal monetary transactions, auto theft, prostitution, smuggling of raw materials and military hardware, extortion, bribery, and executions.18
<p>
Paying protection money to them has become a normal cost of doing business for many. Those who refuse to pay may discover an auto bomb, an arsonist, a kidnapper, or an assassin's bullet waiting for them. 
<p>
Politicians vowing to crack down on crime have become its victims. Three members of the Russian Duma have been shot in gangland-style executions. The leader of the Christian-Liberal Party of Crimea was executed in June 1994, as was his successor two months later. The Chairman of the National-Democratic Party of Georgia was gunned down in December 1994.19   
<p>
Those who have uncovered corruption and brought it to light publicly have done so at their peril. Vladislav Listyev, Russia's popular TV journalist, who had recently been appointed executive director of Russian Public Television, was gunned down March 2 this year. Listyev had begun revising policies on advertising revenues to break the "circle of corruption."20  No traces of the hitmen have been found. As one Muscovite observed wryly, "Who wants to investigate Listyev's death?  He will be next."
<p>
When the 27-year-old journalist Dimitri Kholodov pursued the whiff of corruption, he discovered evidence of illegal arms sales by the Red Army forces withdrawing from Germany. His investigation led him to the top:  Matvei Burlakov, former commander in chief of the forces in Germany, to the military intelligence, and to Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. On October 17, 1994, the journalist was murdered with a booby-trapped briefcase he had been told contained incriminating evidence. The killers have not been found. The Moskovsky Komsomolyets has charged Grachev and other top military officers with complicity in Kholodov's assassination.

<p>

Corruption among the police is rampant. When a new Russian car was stolen this May in Moscow several days after a Duma advisor purchased it, he reported it to the local police. They advocated getting in touch with the criminal elements in his region, suggesting that he could get the car back by paying half its original purchase price. The police offered to help him contact the mafia. This kind of maneuver has become standard procedure, confirm other Russians.21  Rings of auto thieves in Europe smuggle cars from Germany to Poland, or into the Czech Republic -- so many that insurance companies have placed agents on site to purchase cars back from the mob. 

<p>



<b>Violent and Economic Crime Rising</b>

<p>

The Russian Ministry of the Interior reports that in 1994 violent crime increased, as did economic crime. Police recorded 5,000 murders in Moscow alone in 1993; there were 10 percent more in 1994. Kidnappings increased threefold last year, with 272 cases in Moscow alone. Smuggling rose dramatically, 13 times the amount discovered in 1993. Illegal currency transactions were up 60 percent. Three times as many investors were deceived in 1994, losing $4 billion worth of investments.22  More than 14,000 persons were reported missing last year, feared to have been killed by gangs who duped them into signing over rights to their privatized apartments in return for lifetime support. These victims, many of them elderly women, simply disappeared.23  Some 16,600 cases of criminal activity by government officials were reported for 1994, about a third of them involving bribery. However, these statistics on crime most certainly represent only a fraction of the reality. 

<p>

The report by the Russian Ministry of the Interior also documents threatened acts of sabotage for ransom in 1994. A criminal band demanded $1 million not to poison the city water system of the town of Vladimir. In Maikop, bandits demanded $100,000 not to blow up a hospital. In both cases, the criminals were arrested and the act thwarted, but the potential for such future threats is obvious and chilling. 

<p>

Former KGB agents are now employed in industrial intelligence, peddling their information to the highest bidder. Military weapons are routinely stolen and sold to gangsters:  nearly 6,500 cases of such theft were reported in 1993, including machine guns, hand grenades, and explosives.24  More menacing yet are the attempts of organized crime to steal nuclear material for sale on the international black market. Mikhail Yegorov, head of the organized crime department of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, acknowledges 47 investigations into attempts to steal radioactive materials in Russia.25  However, German intelligence sources estimate the number of sales of nuclear material from former Warsaw Pact countries and the former Soviet Union at "between 300 and 350."26
<p>
Natural resources such as timber, oil, and precious metals have been hemorrhaging over the borders of Russia. The Russian Interior Ministry claims smuggling of oil and other resources jumped 50 percent from 1992 to 1993.27  Copper, nickel, and cobalt are bought up at subsidized local prices and spirited over the borders for lucrative sales abroad. Although Estonia produces no metal, enough passed through it in 1993 to make the tiny country one of the world's largest metal exporters.28

<p>
<b>The Geese That Lay Golden Eggs</b>
<p>
It is no accident that laws limiting such activities have not been passed in Russia. There is a substantial segment of the existing power structure which benefits from these transactions. The first people to profit from "privatization" were party functionaries who seized profitable capacities for themselves, rechristening them with new names to sound like Western firms. The Russian newspaper Golos claims 80 percent of the joint ventures involve former KGB officers. Organized crime has linked arms with the old guard and new legislators to protect these geese which lay golden eggs. 

<p>

Those under mafia protection can circumvent the prohibitive taxes, which can take 80 percent of income all told. At those rates, a mafia contract for 10 percent to 20 percent looks like a godsend. Confiscatory tax rates are one of the strongest incentives toward collusion with the mafia. With total tax levels between 55 percent and 80 percent of net income, and theoretically up to 120 percent of profits, no one in their right mind pays all the taxes that are due. Because the mafia net extends into the offices that review tax collection, and into the banks which extend credit, the squeeze to collaborate is inexorable.

<p>

The problems facing Russia are acute, if not overwhelming. In order to encourage stable reform in Russia, it is necessary to identify short-, medium-, and long-term strategy to combat criminality and encourage the growth of a healthy society. No amount of aid will be sufficient to solve Russia's problems. The fundamental problems must be addressed from within. Rather than trying for a "quick fix," the U.S. should acknowledge that major change in the former Soviet Union may be measurable in generations rather than years.

<p>

There are three levels where action is needed:  immediate measures Russians can take, measures the U.S. can take, and U.S.-Russian cooperative efforts.

<p>



<b>What Russians Can Do Now</b>

<p><ul>

<li>Reform tax laws to non-confiscatory levels. As long as total tax rates hover between 55 percent and 80 percent, the incentive to collaborate with the mafia to avoid them will remain exceedingly attractive. 



<li>Define property rights and enforce them. Ownership of the land on which buildings stand is still enshrouded in legal fog in Russia, permitting authorities to act arbitrarily in collusion with criminal elements. 



<li>Pass new legislation on banking and securities. The laws of three years ago are long outdated in light of the rapidly changing economic situation. Until the law is up to date, unscrupulous operators will continue to dupe investors. 



<li>Penalize fraud and aggression. Only a fraction of the criminals are apprehended, and fewer yet actually tried and sentenced. If there are no consequences for crime, it will continue to increase. 



<li>Require public disclosure of public servants' income. At present, bureaucrats on the take can easily collect illegal income and bribes with no fear of revealing sources. 



<li>Protect witnesses. At present, there is no provision to encourage truthfulness among those who know of corruption but have good reason to remain silent. 



<li>Increase cooperation across international borders in apprehending criminals, weapons, nuclear material, and drugs. Sophisticated criminals benefit from the snafus between international law enforcement agencies.

</ul>

<p>



<b>What the U.S. Can Do Now</b>

<p>

U.S. efforts to help Russia at the government level have not been effective. Representatives Richard Gephardt (D-MO) and Robert Michel (R-IL) delivered tough criticism last year, complaining "there remains a yawning gap between America's good intentions and the actual performance of our assistance programs."29  Delays, personnel problems, and bickering have thwarted assistance. Exacerbating the problem is AID's inexperience in this region of the world and its slow learning curve. AID's experience in Africa is not transferable; nor are most of its usual contractors appropriate.30 
<p>
Delivering the goods in Russia is no easy task. Much humanitarian aid and funding for training programs have disappeared into black holes of corruption. The old structures which ruled Russia before are virtually all still in place. They were corrupt before and still are. Few Westerners have taken the time and effort to dig down into a given institution to discover an honest person at the middle level who can be trusted. Large grants to public institutions are almost certain to end up in the Swiss bank accounts of the top administrators and not in the hands of those intended to benefit. Conversely, hefty consulting fees to Westerners have enriched them, but seldom helped the Russians in need.

<p><ul>

<li>The entire strategy of assistance must be revamped, based on personal accountability and cultural prudence. Much of what has been done through foreign aid should be privatized. There are organizations in the private sector which have years of experience in Russia; they should be called on in contracting assistance for the Newly Independent States.31  A partnership between the public and private sectors is needed, with the emphasis on mobilizing the private sector both in the U.S. and in the NIS.

<li>Train Russian police, lawyers, and judges in the moral foundations of a rule of law. Nowhere in their educational system was there such training available, and there is an acute shortage of qualified personnel. Western legal foundations have the resources to train promising Russians and to assist in drafting new law needed now. More student scholarships are needed, as are programs to retrain professionals. Reaching out through legal foundations in Russia like that of Duma advisor Anatoly Pchelintsev is a place to start.32 

<li>Train Russian entrepreneurs in the moral foundations of a market economy. As long as business ethics is an oxymoron, the economy will remain a jungle. Economist Alexander Zaichenko trains businessmen in the principles of organization, but also exhorts them to deal honestly. Zaichenko is building groups for "Fair and Ethical Business" to help them help each other preserve integrity. His protegees have succeeded in setting up new businesses and creating jobs.33  The Canadian government has lauded his group as the most effective of ten they have funded. His organization needs computers and Western investors looking for reliable Russian partners.

<li>Target loans to Russian businessmen of integrity with accountability. The approach of Enterprise Development International in granting microloans to budding businesses puts the incentives in the right place. The Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE) is advancing private enterprise and market institutions which support democratic development. Encouraging self-sufficient small businesses will create jobs and opportunities in a country struggling to make the transition from a planned economy.



<li>Create "Spheres of Integrity" in the economy. This intriguing concept was developed by Czechs to break the stronghold of corruption there. Business associates make a covenant with each other to honor contracts and deal honestly, even if it is not possible in the rest of the outside world.34  Where there is light, the darkness recedes.
</ul><p>
The same principle applies to focusing aid to a limited number of geographic regions where the U.S. can make a difference. A country stretching over ten time zones is too big to help with diffuse efforts. Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Vladivostok, and the Ural mountains region are good candidates for focused efforts.

<p>

German assistance to the former Soviet Union has taken this approach. Undersecretary of the Interior Horst Waffenschmidt has concentrated aid on six regions, building up an infrastructure with honest partners to create "<i>Insel der Hoffnung</i>," or "Islands of Hope."

<p><ul>

<li>Help television transmit the values underpinning democracy. Russian bureaucrats are dragging their feet to privatize their media. Former dissident Mikhail Kazachkov has founded "Freedom Channel-Persona" for broadcasting in Russia. Endorsed by Yelena Bonner, this team produces award-winning programming to lay the foundations of a free society. Highly motivated, professional, and effective, this group focuses on principles like respect for the individual in developing a pluralistic civil society. They need broadcast equipment and program funding to establish a Russian version of C-SPAN. They have applied for AID assistance, but in vain. 



<li>Use the Russian media to tell the story of freedom. Russian newspapers are willing to run articles on the foundations of democracy and the market economy, and on morality. German businessman Waldemar Murjahn has placed articles on the Christian roots of morality in such newspapers as <i>Argumenti i Fakti, Komsomolskaya Pravda, Literaturnaya Gazeta</i>, and <i>Poesk</i>. The combined press runs total one billion, and the costs were modest.



<li>Keep the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on the air. Anybody who thought the job was over when communism collapsed is wrong. Restructuring the post-communist order is at least as tough as opposing communism, and there is no blueprint. An entire culture is seeking reorientation. What passes for democracy today is a far cry from the real thing. 

</ul><p>

More ominously, criminal elements are brazenly executing those who uncover corruption. The slayings of journalists Dimitri Kholodov and Vladislav Listyev illustrate the deadly consequences of telling the truth. An international source of reporting is needed to offset Russian media likely to be increasingly intimated by organized crime or political extremists.

<p>

<b>Note for U.S. budget cutters</b>:  No new funds needed. See the proposals of Ariel Cohen of The Heritage Foundation on reprogramming $225 million by abolishing the Commodities Import Program and scrapping the Russian Officer Resettlement Program.35  AID obligated $2.5 billion but expended only $1.2 billion for combined FYs 1992-95.36  It is just as well:  most of this could be done far better in the private sector anyway. 

<p>
<b>In for the Long Haul</b>
<P>
There is no way that Russia can become a true democracy with a flourishing market economy overnight. Overcoming 70 years of communism is difficult enough, but the problem is deeper yet. Nowhere in the entire history of Russia was there a sustained period of personal freedom linked to economic and political sovereignty for the individual. The transitions of East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary to democratic capitalism may not be smooth, but they are taking place because these countries are returning to a form they once knew. The roots were in the culture, even if they had been buried for a time. That is not the case with Russia. It may well take many years before the Russian culture can unlearn the traits inculcated under communism and the czars and become a culture which restrains itself by choice rather than by force.

<p>

Investing in human resources through scholarships and training programs, enabling help for self-help, and strengthening the private sector and civil society there are likely to yield long-term benefits. Only if Russians are equipped to master their own problems can they revitalize their society from within to make Russia a country which is free, democratic, and stable.

<p>

The U.S. has a great deal to offer toward this end. However, Western efforts to help Russia and the former Soviet republics have been thwarted for a variety of reasons. There is an increasingly allergic reaction of Russians to the arrogant and often ignorant Westerners who have descended on their country. Cultural sensitivity is needed, as is patience. Russia does not want to be a Western knock-off, as a growing number of Russians are quick to point out.

<p>

There are many Russians who have identified the problems of their country and who are eminently qualified to address the needs for both political reform and moral renewal. They stand in the strategic realms of academia, in the media, and in grass-roots movements. America can help best not by trying to make Russia a copy of itself, but by nurturing indigenous Russian efforts. In the words of Vitaly Zhurkin, Director of the Institute of Europe in the Russian Academy of Sciences, "These are Russian problems, and we need Russian solutions."37 
<p>
There are areas where Russians have asked for Western help, or have acknowledged a special role the West can play.
<p><ul>
<li>Foster the growth of Russian civil society. It was the cells of civil society that contributed to unraveling communism throughout the entire East bloc, and it is precisely here that the culture can be reknit. Clusters of grass-roots organizations of lawyers, farmers, teachers, writers, businessmen, and doctors are proliferating, but they have little or no knowledge of each other. Newsletters and data-base exchanges would permit them to help one another. They need computers and fax machines from the West, as well as organizational know-how. 

<p>

The private sectors of America and Europe are needed to help, through thousands of partnerships. The Center for Civil Society is tackling this task honorably, but much potential in America is still untapped.38 

<p>

Until there is growth of a genuine civil society to create culture separate from the state, the threat of a totalitarian throwback will loom large. It is in our own interest to insure that this not happen.

<p>

<li>Create a Resource Bank for Western groups aiding the NIS. There is a wealth of private sector initiatives in the West which are active, motivated, and largely unaware of one another. For understandable logistical reasons, few have an overview of the vast array of needs and possibilities in the East. There is a crying need for an "honest broker" to simply connect the existing resources from those who want to help with receivers. This is a task for the private sector in the U.S.

<p>

Resource materials on the private sector helping from the West exist. A <i>Compendium</i> of nearly 700 U.S. nonprofit activities in Central and Eastern Europe and the New Independent States has been published by the Citizens Democracy Corps. There is also an excellent catalogue of <i>East-West Christian Organizations</i>, listing nearly 700 church and para-church organizations providing assistance.39

<p>

<li>Build bridges between academics, cultural, religious, and economic and political leaders. Networking in the Western sense is non-existent. But until cultural and political reformers make a common cause, they cannot succeed. They do not know or trust one another, and will remain ineffective until they converge. This is one place where the U.S. can render a service by helping to knit up the fabric of a fragmented society, both in the public and private sectors.



<li>Support Russians revamping their school curriculum and retraining teachers. Dr. Aleksandr Abramov, President of the Moscow Institute for Development of Educational Systems, heads an effort with a team of 200 Russian intellectuals who have developed new textbooks of non-revisionist history, literature, and books which include moral teachings. They also offer training seminars for educators, many of whom are genuinely seeking a new orientation. Further manuscripts are ready, but the titles cannot be printed without financial sponsorship. Some of Abramov's books adopted into the Russian curriculum have press runs of a million. The potential to reach the coming generation is staggering.40  Abramov has applied for an AID grant but has received nothing. 

<li>Give intellectual ammunition. The way to moral renewal in Russia is through its own writers, claim many Russians. A rich literature articulates morality and virtue, stemming from such writers as Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Pasternak, Solzhenitsyn, and Pushkin. A <i>Book of Virtues</i>, organized along the lines of Bill Bennett's book,41 could compile the Russian vision of such virtues as self-discipline, compassion, responsibility, friendship, work, courage, perseverance, honesty, loyalty, and faith. How can young Russians better learn virtue than from the best of their own cultural roots?42

<li>Equip teachers now required to teach "ethics and morality" in Russian schools, replacing "scientific atheism" in the curriculum. Most teachers have neither new textbooks nor anything in their own education to prepare them for this task. 

</ul><P>

It is possible to reach them:  Waldemar Murjahn from Germany has single-handedly sponsored a series of articles on morality for the past two years in the Russian publication <i>Uchitilskaya Gazeta</i>, which is sent to all teachers in the former Soviet Union. The publication is willing to accept other material, not only on morality, but on the foundations of a democracy and market economy.43   

<p>

The impact of such efforts should not be underestimated. As Vyacheslav Ivanov writes, 

<blockquote>

	The present-day revival of freedom in the arts may have most significant social results. The cultural and educational consequences of the recent economic reforms may become even more important than all other aspects of the changes.44

</blockquote>

<P>

<b>Mobilize the Private Sector</b>

<p>

The most active segment of the private sector stepping in to fill the gaps left by the collapsed state has been the religious community. Forbidden from charitable works under the communists, parishioners of various denominations are now tending the children of Chernobyl, prisoners, the aged, the homeless, and the handicapped. There are significant ways the U.S. can help by enabling Russians to care for their own. In a cash-strapped country where people used to look to the government for their security, such people are providing help no one else can.

<p>

There is religious freedom now, but there are winds blowing which would limit that of the denominations which are not Russian Orthodox. Some elements of the Orthodox Church are extremely hostile to Protestantism and Judaism and have made a common cause with nationalist extremists. However, there is spiritual hunger in Russia, and there are increasing numbers of highly motivated believers eager to put their faith into practice. Here are concrete needs America's believers can help meet by helping Russians to help themselves.

<p><ul>

<li>Support efforts in the private sector to retrain prisoners. Former prisoners of conscience are actively reaching detainees to help them begin a new life. Yakov Dukhonchenko in Ukraine, and Ivan Fedotov and Alexander Ogorodnikov in Russia are successfully turning lives around.45  Supplying them with the equipment to run a bakery, or seeds to plant farms, enables prisoners to be honestly self-sufficient when they are released.  

<p>

"Faith, Love and Hope" is an initiative run by Natalia Vyssotskaya which teaches women prisoners in Russia skills which will serve them once they are released. It has received the approval of the Patriarch of Moscow.46 

<p>

<li>Support efforts to scoop the youth off the streets. One of the most effective ways to fight juvenile crime is preventive care. Church-related groups are taking teenagers in off the street and teaching them job skills other than racketeering and prostitution, the favored choices of many young Russians. Providing sewing machines, tools, and job training is an investment in a productive future. Linking American youth to these fledgling help organizations could provide motivation for both.



<li>Keep the door open for churches. An enormous amount of humanitarian assistance and aid for training has poured in from Western churches and para-church organizations. Unfortunately, as the door opened for such groups, every variety of exotic sect and cult descended on Russia as well. Add to that the Russian Orthodox Church's hostility to other denominations, and it becomes clear why there are Russians in power trying to slam the door to the West.

</ul><p>

Twice legislation limiting access to Russia by other denominations has been presented to Yeltsin, and twice he has refused to sign it into law. A new amendment was also rejected by Yeltsin on May 22 this year.47  Although it was intended to block totalitarian sects like Japan's Aum Shinrikyo while preserving room for responsible groups, Yeltsin surprised its proponents by rejecting the amendment as too restrictive.48

<p>

Mikhail Gorbachev realized nearly ten years ago that for <i>perestroika</i> to be effective, the religious segment of Russia needed to be mobilized. Gorbachev reasoned that the country needs workers who do not drink on the job and do not steal, as a matter of principle.49  The same is true today. Now that the state has collapsed, charitable work caring for the homeless, the aged, and penniless pensioners is sorely needed. People of faith in Russia are stepping in to fill the gaping holes. Believers abroad can, and do, help them. 

<p>

However, elements of both the government and the Russian Orthodox Church oppose the influence of the foreign religious community. The days of the open door may be numbered. 

<p>



<b>Obedience to the Unenforceable</b>

<p>

This is a realm beyond that of policy. It is one in which it is only possible to answer for one's own conscience. Duma member and former dissident Valerie Borschov has observed:  "The main problem is society's passage from communism to democracy without passing through a stage of personal renewal   .... Society cannot be renewed, but individual persons can."50 

<p>

The founders of America structured its government on the premise that man is endowed with abilities and responsibilities and a moral obligation to his Creator. They also understood man's propensity for evil, and therefore created a system of laws and institutions of government designed to limit the amount of damage we could inflict on one another. The Founding Fathers knew very well that order in a free society depends on the character of its citizenry. Adam Smith knew that a market without benevolence and a moral foundation would yield immoral business. The American experiment, which fused the concept of limited government with a market economy, flourished as long as the morality of the country did so. It can function only as long as its citizens are governed by what Midge Decter astutely terms "obedience to the unenforceable." 

<p>

A sense of personal, transcendent morality was all but eradicated in the communist countries. But arguably it has deteriorated in the West as well. As products of a secularized culture, whose roots in the Judaeo-Christian heritage have been largely forgotten and wrenched from the public domain, we have little to offer. How can we communicate what we no longer hold ourselves? 

<p>

The experiment of communism attempted to eradicate God. Its ideology was not agnostic, but aggressively atheistic:  Jews, Christians, and Moslems were all anathema. Communists silenced, imprisoned, and executed untold numbers of men and women of faith. There may be more modern martyrs than in any previous century. 

<p>

The virtues of personal restraint and homage to the transcendent, which are embodied in the Ten Commandments, the Golden Rule, and the Torah, are remarkably consistent. Judaism and Christianity are unanimous in condemning murder, stealing, and lying while acknowledging our need for family, forgiveness, and a right relation to our Creator. The harmony of the world's great religious teachings on these basic precepts reveals an immutable Natural Law each faith has discovered.51 

<p>

These eternal precepts were replaced by the secularized religion of Marxism-Leninism. We are in the process of trading them for secular humanism and materialism. As Russian sociologist Mikhail Tarusin puts it, "A non-believer is unpredictable, can do anything. A believer has in his soul a system of restraints. When the Russian people realize this, maybe there will be hope for change."

<p>

The same is true for Americans. Any culture which no longer acknowledges eternal truths unravels morally. We see the results not only in the former communist countries, but in our own. If we attempt to raise the banner of virtue and honor, it is for ourselves as well. 

<p>

Russian poet and novelist Fazil Iskander describes his despair, but also his hope for Russia. The truth of his words transcends our borders. 

<blockquote>

	 The great bluff of communism is being replaced by the provincial bluff of nationalism.... In our confused, dark time, who will restore our appetite for creation?  Darkness can be opposed only by light and clarity. We need a natural authority with a clearly expressed will to good, with a clearly creative program, with clear laws that defend the work of those who create. But while bickering continues in the structures of power, while the representatives of national authority hang on one another like exhausted boxers, we cannot expect any creative energy. Hatred reigns. When the earth becomes parched for lack of love, it is irrigated with blood.... It is high time for us to resign ourselves to changing our slovenly universality to an honest particularity. Thus we will be closer to eternity.52

</blockquote>

<h3> Report From Russia: Politics, Economics, and The NATO Expansion Issue</h3>
<p>
By Evgueni Volk, Director, Heritage Foundation Moscow Office, before the Political Committee of the North Atlantic Assembly on May 28, 1995.
<p>
	The domestic situation in Russia and the NATO expansion problem are closely interrelated and influence each other in a number of important directions. It is extremely difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of such an interaction, but it seems obvious that the process will be long, complicated, and even painful.
<p>
	Russia is undergoing a difficult transition in its social, economic, and political systems. The point of departure is more or less clear:  Russia was once a totalitarian communist system. As for the point of destination, no public consensus yet exists. When speaking of democracy, civil society, the rule of law, and the market economy, the Russian people differ in their understanding of these concepts. Moreover, the psychological legacy of the past has engendered a negative attitude toward these internationally accepted values. The pace of reforms has been significantly hampered by a lack of agreement concerning these values.
<p>
	Nevertheless, recent years have witnessed breakthroughs in building a genuine democratic system. The privatization process is one of them. Its main outcome to date has been the gradual formation of a new entrepreneurial class with private ownership and commercial and political initiative. Despite its numerous controversial features, privatization generally continues, and it is the chief litmus test for Russian economic reform.
<p>
	Politically, a free electoral system is the principal result of reform. It is the first experience for the Russians in choosing their representatives to the legislative power and, by this, influencing the policy of the government.
<p>
	The freedoms of the press and expression are another major gain of the Russian reform. They guarantee the irreversibility of the democratic process. The mass media also play a significant part in the system of checks and balances, and their position is hard to ignore. However, the press is often subjected to intimidation and financial pressure from legal and illegal centers of power.
<p>
	Russian reforms are facing severe obstacles. No real anti-totalitarian revolution has taken place, and the communist <i>nomenklatura</i>, ill-equipped for a democratic environment, remains the source of political and economic power. In many cases privatization merely legalized the monopolistic control of industrial giants on the market, entailing inflation and stagnation. And the market has yet to break down Russia's highly militarized economy.
<p>
	Executive power is far stronger than the legislative power and is further consolidating its position. In fact, Russia's bureaucracy is more powerful, wasteful, and arrogant than its Soviet predecessor. A lack of public control mechanisms contributes to an unprecedented spread of corruption. People feel unprotected against arbitrary bureaucratic rule.
<p>
	The Russian economic mentality is still largely based on paternalist and egalitarian ideas. People believe that the government should take care of them in every situation. This provokes an increase in overregulatory governmental functions, with direct interference in all the spheres of economic life. Bureaucratic control over the economy is growing. Egalitarian trends predetermine a negative attitude toward industrious and wealthy people who succeeded in building their well-being by honest labor. This is particularly true in rural areas, where private farmers are discriminated against and preference is given to the old collective farms. The vested interest of the old economic <i>nomenklatura</i> in preserving its economic power hinders the progress of reform and impedes the efficiency of production.
<p>
	The weakness of democratic political and economic institutions has contributed to the rising crime rate. About 75 percent of private companies have to pay up to 20 percent of their income as protection money to mobsters. More and more people are joining businesses owned and operated by criminals. The law enforcement agencies are highly corrupted. The taxation rate is so high (up to 90 percent of income) that the majority evades it by concealing revenues.
<P>
	The Russian political scene demonstrates the weakness of Russia's democratic institutions. There exist several hundred political parties, but very few of them have influence and virtually none can get an overwhelming majority in the parliament. Confrontation between center-right democrats and left-wing communists continues, and the centrist parties are not playing a significant role. Democrats are not in good shape, as people tend to attribute the failure of reform to their ideas rather than to a lack of persistence in their implementation. But neither communists nor nationalists have any efficient remedies. Attempts to consolidate a "centrist" party of power such as Chernomyrdin's "Our Home-Russia" are made again and again, but only time will show how solid this bloc will be.
<p>
	Many of the political differences of the parties arise from different economic interests. The sectors of the economy that depend on further international cooperation (such as the oil, gas, trade, and banking industries) are internationalist and more open to the West. Others that suffer either from competition with the West (such as the agricultural sector and consumer industries) or from the relaxation of tension (such as the military-industrial complex) are more isolationist and nationalist.
<p>

<b>RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICY AND NATO EXPANSION</b>
<p>
	The collapse of the Soviet Union brought about a profound crisis in Russia's national identity. Russia's role as a world power has decreased, and an inferiority complex has emerged. As a result, Russians are becoming more nostalgic for the Soviet past when their country was, in their eyes, more powerful and wealthy. Many Russians still view themselves as Soviet and not Russian citizens and believe that the disintegration of the USSR was a mistake. The rise of a nationalist sentiment, including its aggressive component, is a response to political and economic challenges the society faces. Psychologically, many people doubt that the newly independent states are truly independent. The feeling of Orwell's "Big Brother" is as widespread as the conviction that these states cannot survive without Russia. 
<p>
	 The idea of a "great power" today is based largely on nuclear potential. It clearly does not rest on Russia's economic performance. Two-thirds of the Russian population live below the minimum subsistence level. According to all major social and economic indicators, Russia can hardly be regarded as a prosperous country. This engenders a bitterness that is often the fuel of extremist political parties.
<p>
	The expectation after the demise of communism was that the Western alliance would pay for Russia's transition to democratic capitalism. When it became evident that this would not occur, Russians were profoundly disappointed. The result has been a rising anti-Western mentality among the Russian people. This sentiment is easily manipulated by communists and extreme nationalists.

<p>	The Chechen crisis shocked Russian society. It clearly exposed the fact that little had changed in the new democratic Russia. Excessive secrecy, anti-democratic decision-making, neglect of impartial expertise and public opinion, lies, and brutality toward peaceful citizens were rampant throughout the Chechen operation, as they were during Soviet times as well. Few Russians doubt the criminal nature of Dudayev's regime in Chechnya. But they ask how he was allowed to gain power and to obtain enormous amounts of weapons. Until there is a definite political answer, no prospects for a peace settlement are feasible. The guilty are seeking ways to evade responsibility by waging a bloody war to wipe away all evidence of their crime.
<p>
	Foreign policy issues are not that important to the average Russian. The ordeal of day-to-day survival is far more important for a large majority of Russians. But for exactly these reasons, some politicians are trying to change the subject from their domestic policy failures to foreign policy. In this respect the NATO expansion issue is the perfect target for channelling popular discontent into a foreign policy issue.
<p>
	The Russian attitude toward the NATO expansion debate is 99 percent domestically motivated. The following ingredients create a nutrient medium for resisting NATO expansion plans, irrespective of their true nature and timing:  the alleged failure of the Western development model, disappointment with insufficient Western assistance, the growth of nostalgic pro-communist and xenophobic sentiments brought about by low living standards, an aggressive nationalist and isolationist stand, and weakness of democratic tradition and institutions.
<p>
	The Russian public, in fact, knows very little about NATO. Nearly 100 percent of the common people, if asked about the issue, would say that NATO was an "aggressive military bloc."  The power of the Cold War stereotypes is still great, and even Russian politicians -- some deliberately, some unintentionally -- suffer from myopia as far as NATO is concerned. While never doubtful of the peaceful intentions of the U.S., U.K., Germany, or France individually, Russians easily and illogically become fearful of the NATO alliance as a whole.
<p>
	The Russian debate on NATO is lacking in expertise and competence. The NATO evolution process -- through the Harmel Report to the Declaration in Rome and others -- is completely overlooked, as are numerous non-military spheres of action, including political consultation, and economic, scientific, and ecological cooperation. Restricting NATO to a mere military function is a favored means for its opponents to criticize it. Unfortunately, little has been done in recent years by NATO and the Russian democratic movement to dispel the alliance's false image with the Russian public. No matter what the reason -- a lack of political will or resources -- there is no excuse for this failure.
<p>
	I share the views of those Russians who see no problems with NATO expansion. I even welcome it. The North Atlantic alliance remains the most efficient and viable security structure in the world. It has long ceased to be just a military alliance (if it ever was) to become a politically motivated organization projecting and disseminating democratic values. Political goals have always been central to this strategy, and the 50 years of peace in Europe can be attributed to NATO's resolve to defend freedom and democracy. The plans to incorporate new members mean further guarantees of democratic and stable development in Central and Eastern Europe with no threat to anybody.
<p>
	Only people with a confrontational mentality can presume that the NATO enlargement will jeopardize Russian security interests. But should, to Russia's great misfortune, those interests be usurped and misinterpreted by extremist forces, NATO would undoubtedly act in keeping with its political and military deterrence function in order to maintain international security and stability.
<p>
	Russian political forces who associate themselves with the Western alliance are by no means numerous. But this fact does not mean that there is an anti-NATO consensus, as some people in Moscow claim. The absence of an accepted national security strategy provides ground for arbitrary interpretation of national interests and threats and challenges. It prevents Russian foreign policy from adopting a consistent, long-term approach to any international problem. As a result, the NATO expansion issue cannot be put in proper perspective. Thus, old Soviet-era prejudices often get the upper hand in the debate. 
<p>
	 Of course, the Russian military has a vested interest in opposing NATO expansion. In order to survive and maintain a high profile, the armed forces believe that they must have a clearly identified and strong adversary. NATO is the largest military power closest to the Russian borders, and wishful thinking can easily attribute the "enemy image" to it. Moreover, cooperation with NATO requires that the armed forces be more open in the way they conduct their business. This is something the Russian military is not used to. After the Chechen events it seems clearer that traditional secrecy was designed largely to conceal the limitations rather than merits of the Soviet Army, and this trend is likely to persist. Finally, existing arms control agreements do not suit the Russian military, as they impose restrictions on their ambitious military plans and programs.

<p>	Regardless of the obstacles, NATO expansion should proceed in conformity with European and global security and stability interests. NATO may not be perfect, but no other more efficient mechanisms exist on the continent. I appreciate the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's important political role in the West-East dialogue (since I participated in its diplomatic process, too). However, the OSCE has not shown itself to be an adequate substitute for NATO. As far as the CIS security structure is concerned, its shape undoubtedly faces serious difficulties, and the ultimate result is still unclear.
<p>
	In the course of its expansion, NATO should be well aware of misperceptions and apprehensions that are sometimes exaggerated in Russia. Political and informational effort should be made to dispel them. Therefore: 
<p><ul>
<li>Versatile bilateral cooperation between NATO and Russia should develop; <br>

<li>The new generation of Russian politicians, military men, and researchers should be more resolutely involved in NATO and North Atlantic Assembly activities; <br>

<li>The issue of NATO special educational programs for Russia should be addressed;<br>

<li>The Russian military should be brought under civilian and public control to avoid future Chechnyas; and<br>

<li>Russia's active participation in the Partnership for Peace program is a precondition for building up mutual confidence and security.
<p></ul>
	If these steps are taken, close political contacts between NATO and Russia could develop into a special partnership. Russia's full membership in NATO, which looks quite improbable today, could become a reality in the 21st century.<p>

<title>How To Improve the Quality of Children's Television - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3>HOW TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CHILDREN'S TELEVISION</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/thierer.htm">Adam D. Thierer</a><br>
Alex C. Walker Fellow in Economic Policy<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 450<br>
May 20, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A crusade has been underway in Congress in recent years to improve the quality of broadcast television on behalf of America's children. While obviously well-intentioned, these efforts have failed because they have preserved the current uncompetitive regulatory structure instead of allowing market competition to expand the number of new educational choices available to the average American family. But Congress now has a rare opportunity to improve the quantity and quality of children's programming by inviting a host of new competitors into the marketplace through expanded auctions of broadcast spectrum.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, 104 Members of Congress recently reaffirmed their commitment to the status quo when they sent a letter to the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) asking the agency to strengthen provisions of the Children's Television Act of 1990 (CTA). The problem is that the Children's Television Act actually has more to do with making work for communications industry regulators than with improving the quality of children's television. Although the Act does demand that broadcasters air more programming that "meets the educational and informational needs of children," it fails to define what that means. As a consequence, a lot of bureaucrats must spend a lot of time watching cartoons to decide what they think is "educational" and what is not.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Bureaucrats decide "Fat Albert" is educational, "The Flintstones" is not.</b> For example, according to recent FCC rulemakings, both "Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids" and "The Smurfs" are deemed "educational."  "The Flintstones" and "G.I. Joe" have not been so lucky. They have been singled out as being out of compliance with the CTA. Instead of asking the FCC to watch cartoons, Congress should ask itself whether regulators should be deciding what children watch at all. Any improvements in the quality of broadcasts in recent years can be attributed to the rise of cable and other video competitors, not edicts from Washington. Efforts such as the CTA are riddled with implementation problems and do nothing to improve the long-run quality of broadcast television. The real answer, as in the world of books and magazines, is to allow more choices and let parents decide for themselves what programs or channels are truly educational.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Washington knows best?</b>  The 104 Members of Congress who wrote to the FCC want the Commission to establish a minimum number of hours of acceptable programming per week that broadcasters must air. The letter declares that the FCC should establish a quantitative federal requirement of at least three hours of federally approved "educational" programming that private broadcasters must air each week or risk having their broadcasting licenses revoked. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While license revocation is rare in practice, it is the indirect pressure of federal oversight that counts in influencing programming. In essence, the FCC uses laws like the CTA to engage in regulatory extortion: Either firms meet the Commission's demands or they forgo marketplace opportunities which the FCC has the authority to restrict, such as a merger with another communications company.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All of this begs the question of why Congress does not make similar demands of companies doing business in the print media marketplace. Why is it that <I>The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times</i>, and other newspapers do not have to devote three pages of their "A" sections to issues Washington bureaucrats define as "educational and informational"?  While one could argue that it is because the print media already are more focused on such issues than the more entertainment-minded broadcast industry, in reality the answer lies in seven decades worth of misguided First Amendment jurisprudence that has accorded electronic media lesser speech protections and access to markets than print media. As a consequence, laws like the CTA continue to be applied to electronically transmitted media such as broadcasting, even though they would never pass constitutional muster if applied to the print realm. Serious questions remain as to how the CTA will be enforced once most newspapers and magazines are delivered to Americans electronically.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, such bureaucracy-enhancing efforts clearly do not complement last year's deregulatory efforts aimed at reducing federal meddling in communications markets. Instead of encouraging the FCC to expand its cultural inspections, Congress has the unique opportunity to force broadcasters to improve the quality of their programming, without infringing the spirit of the First Amendment, by launching more spectrum auctions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Auctioning spectrum will invite more competition and improve quality.</b> Policymakers could invite greater numbers of educational and informational providers into the marketplace by auctioning off more spectrum, something Congress is now considering. Unfortunately, policymakers are about to give away approximately $10 billion to $70 billion worth of spectrum to the same broadcast industry from which they are trying to demand better programming. This means countless new, innovative educational and informational services may be kept off the market because existing broadcasters will be able to hoard large portions of new spectrum. Consequently, broadcasters will be under even less pressure to offer better quality fare to children and families. Auctioning the spectrum, by contrast, not only would bring in revenue to permit tax cuts and deficit reduction, but also would force incumbent broadcasters to air better quality children's programming to keep in step with their new rivals.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Regulations like the Children's Television Act do not benefit children and should be repealed. Intense rivalry for viewer allegiance, not more federal mandates, is the only way to improve the quality and amount of children's programming. Auction off more spectrum, and America's children will be offered the kind of quality programming they deserve and Congress desires.

<title>Trade With Asia Means Jobs For America - Heritage</title>

<h3>TRADE WITH ASIA MEANS JOBS FOR AMERICA</h3>

F.Y.I. No. 119<br>

<p></center>
<font size="-1"><a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/fyi119t1.gif">Table 1</a>: U.S. Exports to Asia and Jobs Supported by Those Exports: State-by-State Analysis</font>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

U.S.-Asia trade grew dramatically in 1995: The 25.8 percent rise in exports to East and South Asia outpaced the growth in exports to all other regions of the world. At almost $193 billion, U.S. exports to the Pacific Rim and South Asia exceeded U.S. exports to Europe by more than $50 billion and accounted for more than 3.8 million American jobs in 1995. Overall, exports to this dynamic region have created in excess of a million American jobs since 1993 alone.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Individual U.S. states that saw dramatic increases in their exports to Asia in 1995 include South Dakota (81.4 percent more than in 1994), Vermont (49.7 percent more), Georgia (46.5 percent more), Delaware (45.3 percent more), Indiana (45.2 percent more), Louisiana (44.3 percent more), and Texas (40.3 percent more). Also noteworthy was California, the first state to top the one million mark in numbers of workers employed as a result of exports to East and South Asia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Asian demand for American products was particularly high in sectors like transportation equipment, agriculture products, and intellectual property (such as computer software). The good news for American exporters is that these are growth industries. As Michael Walton, chief World Bank economist for East Asia and the Pacific, puts it, "The U.S. and Asia are complementary. The U.S., in terms of its farm sector, technological capability and service sector strength, will experience a rising beneficial integration with East Asia that will be a source of growth for both sides. Asia is growing 8%, but the market there for the kinds of goods and services the U.S. provides is growing in the teens."<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In more good news for the United States, it is predicted that the economies of Asia will continue to grow at high rates for the foreseeable future. As these countries become more prosperous, their demand for American products will increase commensurately. Thus, the U.S. should focus on the tremendous promise offered by the Asia-Pacific region. As the following <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/fyi119t1.gif">table</a> clearly demonstrates, Americans from all 50 states stand to benefit greatly from closer trade relations with the vital and dynamic Asia-Pacific region.

<hr>

If the budget battles with Congress do not keep him in Washington, President 
Bill Clinton will travel to Osaka, Japan, this weekend to meet with leaders 
from Asia and the Americas to discuss trade and investment in the Asia 
Pacific region. They will meet under the auspices of the forum for Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, an organization of Asian and 
Pacific Rim economies dedicated to liberalizing trade and investment.   The 
members of APEC have pledged to create a free trade and investment area in 
Asia and the Pacific Rim by 2020.
<P>
However, this dream may be shattered if China, Japan, and some other APEC 
members get their way. Their unwillingness to open their agricultural markets 
may suffocate the once-bright promise, made by APEC in 1994, to achieve 
"free and open trade and investment in the Asia Pacific" region. This would 
represent a severe setback for regional trade liberalization. President Clinton 
and the other leaders at the APEC summit should agree that liberalization will 
be comprehensive, including the liberalization of agricultural trade, or the 
hope for free trade in Asia may wither.
<P>
APEC's backsliding is mainly the fault of the Japanese. Unlike President 
Suharto of Indonesia, who hosted the Leaders' Meeting in 1994, Japanese 
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama has been unwilling to develop a 
consensus plan for making good on the promise of free trade which APEC 
made at its last meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, in 1994. Instead, the Japanese 
government has proposed that APEC members be permitted to exempt so-
called sensitive sectors of their economies from trade liberalization. 
According to the Japanese, the most sensitive sector of all is agriculture. 
China and some other Asian countries are siding with Japan against the U.S., 
while Australia and Canada, among others, support the American position.
<P>
APEC is critical to America's economic future. It serves an institutional link 
between the U.S. and the fast-growing Asian economies. It also is a hedge 
against the formation of an Asia-only trading bloc. APEC encompasses nearly 
50 percent of the world's population, 60 percent of its gross domestic product, 
and 40 percent of its trade flows. U.S. two-way merchandise trade with APEC 
members was $772 billion in 1994 -- 65.6 percent of worldwide U.S. trade or 
11.4 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. In 1994, American investment in 
APEC economies was $202 billion, and APEC foreign investment in the U.S. 
was $163 billion. APEC's goal of free and open trade and investment is 
consistent with long-standing American policy supporting trade liberalization 
around the world.
<P>
Free trade and investment is too important to America's future to let APEC die 
because of irresponsible behavior in Japan and protectionism in other 
countries. Therefore, while in Osaka, President Clinton should:
<ul>
<li>Tell Japanese Prime Minister Murayama that selective exemptions to APEC 
trade liberalization are unacceptable and threaten America's vital national 
interest in trade liberalization in Asia.
<P>
<li>Work closely with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Chile, Indonesia, and 
New Zealand to block Japan's protectionism. These leaders should urge Japan 
to accelerate implementing Uruguay Round trade liberalization commitments 
while seeking new agreements on antidumping, competition policy, product 
standards and testing, and investment protection.
<P>
<li>Make clear that blocking or delaying comprehensive APEC trade 
liberalization would undermine APEC's institutional credibility. Backsliding 
on free trade at Osaka could ring the death knell for APEC as an organization.
<P>
<li>Support Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization if the issue is 
raised bilaterally by the Taiwanese.
</ul><P>

JAPAN'S ACTIONS SINCE BOGOR
<P>
As host of this year's APEC Leaders' Meeting, Japan must chair all 
preparatory meetings and work with senior officials from all APEC members 
to develop a consensus on the summit's agenda. The main challenge is to 
decide how to implement the Bogor Declaration for free and open trade and 
investment in the Asia Pacific region for developed members by 2010 and for 
developing members by 2020.
<P>
The performance of Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in fulfilling 
this vital role has been unsatisfactory. Murayama's unpopular Socialist-Liberal 
Democrat coalition government has been unwilling to undertake any bold 
trade liberalization initiatives to move the APEC agenda forward. The 
Japanese government sought to deflect APEC away from trade liberalization 
in February 1995 by proposing a "Partners for Progress" scheme that would 
turn APEC into little more than a regional conduit for foreign aid. The 
proposal would have established a new secretariat that would coordinate 
foreign aid by advanced APEC members to less developed members such as 
China or Papua New Guinea. Senior officials from other APEC members 
condemned Japan's "Partners for Progress" scheme as an unnecessary 
duplication of existing aid programs and as a distraction from trade 
liberalization. As U.S. Ambassador to APEC Sandra Kristoff remarked in 
February 1995, "the proposal raised in our minds some questions about 
whether it was duplicating ODA  activities already happening elsewhere." 
<P>
Japan later withdrew its "Partners for Progress" proposals, but it has failed to 
offer concrete proposals for APEC trade liberalization. Instead of taking 
action this year, Japan has suggested merely that APEC members wait until 
1996 to table their proposals for "concerted unilateral" and "collective" action 
at the Leaders' Meeting in the Philippines. 
<P>
More ominously, Japan has proposed that APEC members be permitted to 
exempt sensitive sectors of their economies, such as agriculture in Japan or 
clothing manufacturing in the U.S., from APEC trade liberalization. The 
Japanese proposal has become a flash point dividing APEC into two warring 
camps. One camp is led by Japan, which is unwillingly to open its agricultural 
markets beyond the concessions made in the Uruguay Round agreements. 
Supporting Japan is China, which not only seeks to maintain agricultural 
sector barriers, but also wants to protect broad sectors of manufactured goods. 
In the other camp are Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, and the United 
States. These countries have vehemently rejected the Japanese proposal for 
exempting sectors from APEC trade liberalization. Most of the ASEAN 
countries, especially Indonesia and Singapore, also oppose Japan.
<P>
<a name="em"></a>
THE EMINENT PERSONS GROUP
<P>
During the last three years, the Eminent Persons Group (EPG) has provided 
APEC with a free trade vision and shaped its successful agenda. The EPG is 
an APEC-appointed advisory panel composed of one person from each APEC 
member and chaired by C. Fred Bergsten, a former U.S. Treasury official and 
executive director of the Washington-based Institute for International 
Economics.
<P>
In its first report, the EPG recommended "a bold, forward-looking and 
realistic vision for APEC: the progressive development of a community of 
Asia Pacific economies with free and open trade and investment."   The 
Leaders' Meeting near Seattle, Washington, in November 1993 accepted this 
challenge as APEC's goal. In its second report, the EPG recommended that 
"APEC now adopt a comprehensive program to realize the vision of free and 
open trade in the region... and complete the liberalization process by 2020."   
Responding to this challenge, the leaders agreed at their meeting in Bogor, 
Indonesia, on November 15, 1994, that APEC should achieve free and open 
trade and investment in the region by 2020.
<P>
On August 25, 1995, the EPG delivered its third annual report, Implementing 
the APEC Vision, recommending a series of practical steps to begin 
implementing the Bogor Declaration.
<P>
Step #1: Accelerating Uruguay Round Liberalization. The EPG suggests that 
all APEC members agree to accelerate the implementation of their Uruguay 
Round commitments based on the following principles:
<ul>
<li>Principle 1: Unlike preferential trade agreements such as the European Union 
or North America Free Trade Agreement whose trade liberalization benefits 
accrue to their members, APEC should offer the benefits of an accelerated 
liberalization timetable to all members of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO), including those that are not members of APEC. In other words, 
APEC members would not discriminate against other countries in trade 
policy.
<P>
<li>Principle 2: APEC members should adopt a "50 percent rule" under which 
they would cut in half the time for lowering tariffs, removing non-tariff 
barriers, or reforming domestic laws. For example, developed APEC 
members could speed the timetable for Uruguay Round tariff cuts from the 
current four years on most products to two years. Developing APEC members 
could slash the period for phasing out non-agricultural subsidies from eight to 
four years. 
</ul><P>

Step #2: Broadening and Deepening the Uruguay Round Agreements. The 
EPG recommends that Uruguay Round agreements be broadened in the 
following four areas:
<ul>
<li>Antidumping. The EPG finds that antidumping laws have been abused to 
protect domestic firms at the expense of consumers. Antidumping 
proceedings are biased because they consider only the interests of import-
competing firms and their workers, but not the interests of consumers and 
domestic firms dependent on imported supplies for production. They also 
penalize foreign competitors for normal business practices. For example, the 
legal standard for proving a domestic firm guilty of predatory pricing is far 
more stringent in most countries than the legal standard for finding a foreign 
competitor guilty of dumping cheap goods on a domestic market. Thus, the 
same pricing policies that are legal for domestic firms may be held illegal for 
their foreign rivals under antidumping laws. This is pure protectionism. The 
EPG recommends that APEC leaders commit themselves to eliminating such 
abusive uses of antidumping policy.
<P>
<li>Competition Policy. Competition policy encompasses the regulation of 
monopolies, mergers, cartels, and government aid to business firms. Many of 
the trade disputes in Asia arise from differences over competition policy. For 
example, the recent automotive trade dispute with Japan centered on whether 
the keiretsu system of interlocking equity, debt financing, and personnel 
sharing among Japanese companies prevented American suppliers from 
selling their auto parts and cars to Japan. Because the WTO does not deal with 
competition policy, the EPG has called on APEC members to cooperate in 
applying competition policy laws to reduce their differences over time.
<P>
<li>Product Standards and Testing. Product standards and testing can be used as 
protectionist devices. For example, Japan has refused to accept U.S. test data 
on medical equipment and requires American suppliers to conduct another 
round of tests in Japan before certifying their products. Multiple testing can be 
expensive and may deter manufacturers from offering some products in 
certain markets. The EPG recommends that APEC should negotiate 
agreements on standards and testing. It also suggests that all APEC members 
should accept the test data and product certification of any one member, so 
long as they are based on internationally recognized standards.
<P>
<li>Investment Protection. Private-sector investment has produced rapid 
economic growth in the Asia Pacific region. Improving protections for foreign 
investors will help to sustain this growth. The EPG recommends that APEC 
members strengthen their protection of investment in the areas where they fall 
short of international norms. For example, APEC economies should adopt the 
rules followed by NAFTA countries that prohibit imposing restrictions on the 
transfer of funds related to foreign investment such as profits, dividends, 
royalties, loan payments, and liquidations in freely convertible currencies. 
Moreover, APEC should minimize the use of performance requirements such 
as local content or trade balancing rules.   Such rules are inconsistent with the 
new WTO Agreement on Trade Related Investment Measures, which bans 
local content or trade balancing requirements. The EPG urges each member to 
adopt these accommodations and affirm them in a binding agreement among 
all APEC members.
</ul><P>
Step #3: Dispute Mediation Service. The EPG also has recommended that 
APEC create an official mechanism to settle regional trade clashes, to be 
known as the APEC Dispute Mediation Service. The EPG recognizes that 
many of the recent trade disputes in the Asia Pacific region involve subjects 
not covered by current WTO rules. One such subject is competition policy. 
The WTO has no jurisdiction to settle disputes in competition policy and 
other subjects that its rules do not cover. Had an APEC Dispute Mediation 
Service already been established, it could have helped diffuse the Japan-U.S. 
automotive trade wrangle that occurred earlier this year. By resolving disputes 
that the WTO cannot handle, an APEC Dispute Mediation Service would 
supplement and strengthen the WTO.

<a name="asaka"></a>
RESCUING THE OSAKA MEETING
<P>
The Japanese proposal for exempting certain sectors of the economy like 
agriculture would undermine the comprehensive free trade and investment 
regime envisioned by the Bogor Declaration. Once one member is permitted 
to exclude a sensitive sector, other members will follow suit with their own 
protectionist demands. If Japan gets its way, APEC free trade would be more 
the exception than the rule.
<P>
President Clinton must not let any country undermine APEC's bright promise. 
Therefore, he should:
<ul>
<li>Tell Japanese Prime Minister Murayama that selective exemptions to APEC 
trade liberalization are unacceptable and threaten America's vital national 
interest in trade liberalization in Asia. The U.S. cannot accept an APEC trade 
liberalization regime that excludes sectors such as agriculture where 
Americans excel. In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald on 
November 6, U.S. Ambassador to APEC Sandra Kristoff said, "To provide for 
sector exclusions because of domestic sensitivities would be to turn Bogor on 
its head and to call into serious question the continued interest of many of us 
to participate." 
<P>
<li>Work closely with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Chile, Indonesia, and 
New Zealand to block Japan's protectionism. The U.S. is fortunate that most 
other APEC members disagree with the Japanese proposal. President Suharto, 
who views the Bogor Declaration as his legacy, once again may play a key 
role in bridging the division and building a consensus in Osaka. The U.S. 
should support his efforts if he does.
<P>
<li>Make clear that blocking or delaying comprehensive APEC trade 
liberalization would undermine APEC's institutional credibility. Asia's 
economies have benefited greatly from trade liberalization since World War 
II. Without credible international institutions promoting free trade, 
liberalization and the ensuing economic boom in Asia would not have 
occurred. Calling for special exemptions would rob APEC of needed 
credibility in pushing for free trade in the Asia Pacific region.
<P>
<li>Support Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization if the issue is 
raised bilaterally by the Taiwanese. The WTO accession issue likely will not 
be raised by Taiwan in the plenary session of the APEC Leaders' Meeting. It is 
possible, however, that Taiwan's representative will do so in informal bilateral 
meetings with the U.S. In that case, the U.S. should be supportive. Taiwan's 
membership in the WTO should not be held hostage to the People's Republic 
of China's membership in the WTO. Once Taipei meets the WTO's standards, 
it should be allowed to join. Taiwan's membership in the WTO would 
contribute to the overall goal of trade liberalization in the Asia Pacific region.
</ul><P><a name="conc"></a>

CONCLUSION
<P>
APEC is at a crossroads. If Japan is successful in gaining selective 
exemptions to trade liberalization, APEC will lose credibility as an institution 
and will be unable to achieve its dream of "free trade and investment in the 
Asia Pacific" by 2020. President Clinton must fight the Japanese proposal for 
granting selective exemptions and insist upon comprehensive trade and 
investment liberalization in APEC. The U.S. has a number of allies in this 
dispute, especially President Suharto of Indonesia. If the U.S. can join with 
Australia, Canada, Chile, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Singapore to 
overcome the reluctance of Japan, China, and some other countries, APEC 
may lead the world toward a bright future of growing trade and economic 
prosperity.<hr>

<title>F.Y.I. #70 - Exports to Aisa Leads to US Job Creation -- Heritage</title>

<h3><I><center>As U.S. Exports to Asia Boom, So Does Creation of American Jobs

<p>
Trade with Asia is vitally important to the American economy. U.S. exports to East Asia and the 
Pacific Rim in 1994 grew at a healthy 16.2 percent to more than $153 billion. This is the steepest 
increase since 1988. The prosperous nations of the Asia-Pacific region purchased over $45 billion 
more from U.S. exporters than did the 15 nations of the European Union, and almost $30 billion 
more than Europe as a whole.<P>
More exports to Asia means more jobs for Americans. The U.S. Department of Commerce 
estimates that 20,000 American jobs are created for each $1 billion in exports. Thus, in 1994, more 
than 3 million Americans owed their jobs to U.S. exports to Asia. And of these 3 million jobs, more 
than 428,000 were created in 1994 alone.
<P>
The job-creating benefits of these exports were spread liberally across the United States in 1994, 
with 42 of the 50 states exporting more to Asia than in the previous year. California is noteworthy 
in this regard. Its aggressive export promotion program aimed at Asia and the Pacific Rim helped 
the Golden State increase its total 1994 exports to the region by almost $7 billion, creating jobs for 
more than 126,000 Californians. Other noteworthy performances were turned in by Arizona (21.9 
percent growth), Georgia (32.0 percent), Florida (26.6 percent), Illinois (22.8 percent), Oregon 
(21.9 percent), and Texas (19.6 percent).
<P>
Trade with Asia is increasingly important to the health and growth of the American economy. In 
order to create more American jobs and a higher standard of living for the American people, the 
U.S. must expand its access to the increasingly prosperous markets of the Asia-Pacific region. 
Washington can do this by continuing to promote lower trade barriers throughout the region. As the 
U.S. export figures show, America cannot afford trade wars with Asian countries.
<P>
The following chart provides a graphic indication of how much this country stands to benefit or 
lose in trade with Asia. Continuing on the path toward liberalized trade with this lucrative region is 
the road to continued American prosperity. The path toward protectionism and increased U.S. 
barriers to trade, on the other hand, will lead to America's being cut out of Asia's growing markets, 
and thus to fewer jobs and a lower standard of living for all Americans.

<TITLE>STARTING OVER AT THE U.S.-JAPAN SUMMIT -- Heritage </TITLE>

U.S.-Japan Summit: Security Is Now More Important Than Trade,"

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
            

     Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's January 11 visit
to Washington offers Bill Clinton a much-needed second chance to
devise a workable policy toward Japan. His first try was ill-conceived,
poorly executed, and ultimately unsuccessful. By badgering Japan to
agree to numerical trade targets, the Clinton Administration not only
has failed to resolve the longstanding trade dispute with Japan, but also
has missed a golden opportunity to work more closely with the
reformers who, like many in the U.S., want a more open Japanese
economy. The best way to resolve this trade dispute without harming
the valuable strategic relationship between the U.S. and Japan is for the
Clinton Administration to drop its managed trade policies toward Japan
and to form an alliance with Japanese who want broader economic
change.<P>
     Clinton's Japan Policy: A Rushed Political Job. The Clinton
Administration came to office committed to building a new U.S.-Japan
relationship. The Administration argued that the existing relationship
resembled an out-of-balance three-legged stool standing on security, politics,
and economics. The economic leg of this stool, Clinton contended, had to
be extended and strengthened to restore proper equilibrium to the
relationship. Originally conceived as but one element in a three-part
strategy, the trade and economic dimension nevertheless rapidly expanded
in terms of time and effort to become almost the entirety of the Clinton
Administration's approach to Japan. By focusing so much on trade, Clinton
did not restore balance to his three-legged stool; he created a new
imbalance, downplaying important political and security elements of the
U.S.-Japan relationship.<P>
     Clinton's new Japan policy culminated in something called the New
Economic Framework. Cobbled together in Tokyo in July 1993, it was a
rush job. The Framework negotiations were essentially short-term in nature,
geared to make good on the President's promise to produce results in
politically sensitive economic sectors such as autos, auto parts, and
computers. From the very beginning the negotiations over the New
Economic Framework were marked by a high degree of mutual suspicion
and distrust. In October 1994, under pressure of U.S. trade sanctions, the
Framework talks concluded with a last-minute, all-night effort which
produced minimum results. In effect, both governments called a time out in
the increasingly frustrating and contentious talks and agreed to kick the can
down the road.<P>
     U.S. Needs A New Approach. Progress on America's and Japan's
respective economic agendas is important if the two countries are to sustain
and build support for their strategically important relationship. The issue is
not whether Japan should become a more open, consumer-oriented society,
but whether the Clinton Administration's policies offer the best hope for
producing the desired results. The meager results of the Framework talks
thus far argue for de-emphasizing differences on trade strategy and
emphasizing instead the commonality of political, security, and even
economic interests. In other words, the U.S. needs to take a broader strategic
approach to Japan.<P>
     What the Numbers Tell. To start, there is no need for the U.S. to
place such a heavy emphasis on trade policy in defining its relationship with
Japan. When it came to office, the Clinton Administration alleged that the
Japan policies of previous Administrations had failed to produce trade
results. The numbers, however, tell a different story. From from 1987
through 1991, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan fell from $57 billion to $43
billion; total exports to Japan rose by 113 percent, and U.S.-manufactured
exports rose by 64 percent.<P>
     The reasons for the decline had less to do with trade negotiations
than with the fact that Japan's economy was booming and pulling in
American goods and services. The deficit began to go up again when
Japan's economy went into recession in the early 1990s. <P>
     Indeed, the President's own Council of Economic Advisers estimates
that even with near total victory in the Framework negotiations, the trade
deficit would still hover between $40 billion and $50 billion. If this is the
case, it makes little sense to focus so much on trade negotiations. It makes
even less sense to adopt numerical trade targets and other so-called objective
indicators of freer trade. Instead, the main focus of U.S. policy should be on
urging Japan to deregulate and liberalize its entire economy. This would
produce the economic growth needed to stimulate Japanese demand for U.S.
goods and to reduce the trade imbalance with the United States. 
  <P>  This strategy would build on the growing trend inside Japan toward
more deregulation and economic liberalization. By working with reformers
instead of against them in contentious trade talks, the Clinton Administration
could get real results. Rather than being cast as the external force
demanding change in Japan, the U.S. should work with Japan's reformers
to bring internal pressure to bear on Japan's bureaucracy. The result would
be a more open Japanese economy.
  <P>   Centerpiece of Security. However, de-emphasizing trade
negotiations is only one part of this new approach to Japan. The other is to
rediscover the strategic importance of the U.S.-Japan relationship, an
alliance based on a congruence of national interests. Both America and
Japan want an open international trading system and peaceful international
change. Both countries also need to prevent the domination of East Asia by
a hostile power. Across the globe, Japan has backed U.S. diplomatic
initiatives: democracy in Central America, economic development in the
Caribbean basin, the peace process in the Middle East, democracy and
economic reform in the republics of the former Soviet Union, building the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum into an institution for regional
trade liberalization, sending peacekeepers to Cambodia, and supporting U.S.
diplomacy to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
 <P>    At the same time, the U.S.-Japan alliance serves as the centerpiece
of the Asian-Pacific security system and the foundation of its stability and
economic dynamism. This is of direct and immediate importance to U.S.
economic well-being and national security. Beyond the Western Hemisphere,
America's largest markets are in Asia. Last year, trans-Pacific trade totaled
$361 billion, which is over 50 percent greater than trans-Atlantic trade. And
Asia's economies are the fastest-growing in the world.
   <P>  For Japan, Northeast Asia is a tough neighborhood. The Korean
Peninsula remains a conventional, and potentially nuclear, flashpoint. China
faces a daunting political transition when Deng Xiaoping dies. And the
process of democratization and economic reform in Russia promises to be
both protracted and perilous.
  <P>   To meet these challenges, the U.S. and Japan must stand together.
But they cannot do this if they are constantly bickering over negotiations
which have done little to correct the existing trade imbalance. By focusing
so much on trade negotiations, the Clinton White House has overlooked the
value of the alliance and its importance to U.S. regional and global interests.
Statements of the strategic importance of Japan have been confined largely
to the State Department, which is now largely irrelevant to making Japan
policy. That privilege has been reserved primarily by the White House, the
United States Trade Representative, and the Departments of Commerce and
Treasury, none of which has demonstrated a deep understanding of the
strategic relationship between the U.S. and Japan.
 <P>    To get back on track, the Clinton Administration should revive the
U.S.-Japan Global Partnership initiative, which was begun by President
George Bush and then-Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in the Tokyo
Declaration of January 1992. The Global Partnership is both a framework
for political and economic cooperation between the U.S. and Japan and an
action plan to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance. Using the Tokyo
Declaration as his guide, President Clinton should begin to reconstruct and
refocus U.S.-Japan relations. Thus, in the meeting with Prime Minister
Murayama, President Clinton should: <P>
 Reaffirm the U.S.-Japan Global Partnership initiative and the commitments
of the Tokyo Declaration. The Tokyo Declaration committed the U.S. and
Japan to cooperate in shaping a post-Cold War international order based on
"shared principles of political and economic freedom, democracy, the rule
of law, and respect for human rights." It also committed both countries to
"taking effective measures to address factors underlying economic friction,
with a focus on issues in their trading and investment relations." The key is
that the Tokyo Declaration puts the issue of trade in a strategic context. It
recognizes that progress in trade makes little sense if it irreparably severs
the strategic ties linking the U.S. and Japan.<P>
Appoint a binational U.S.-Japan Commission to report on how best to
implement the provisions of the Tokyo Declaration and the Global
Partnership initiative.
Highlight the U.S.-Japan alliance and its continuing relevance to both
countries' security interests. Even in today's post-Cold War world, the
alliance represents a congruence of national interests. It serves as the
cornerstone of stability and security in the Asia-Pacific region. This fact
needs to be at the heart of U.S. policy toward Japan. <P>
 Shift the spotlight of the U.S.-Japan relationship away from trade
negotiations. Instead, the U.S. should focus more on urging the Japanese to
deregulate and liberalize their economy. America will have powerful allies
inside Japan. Taking this approach will be far more productive than
badgering the Japanese over trade targets and other indicators. The Clinton
approach thus far has produced only politically motivated stonewalling
inside Japan.
 <P>    Over the past two years, the Clinton Administration has spent much
time and energy trying to build a new framework for the U.S.-Japan
relationship, one firmly attached to what it calls a "results-oriented" trade
policy. This approach has failed. President Clinton has the opportunity in the
upcoming summit meeting with Prime Minister Murayama to start over. The
first step is to recognize the central importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance
to the strategic interests of the United States. U.S. trade relations with Japan
are very important, but not more so than the relationship itself.

 <TITLE>HOW THE U.S. CAN PROMOTE GREATER FREE TRADE IN ASIA -- Heritage </TITLE>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Heritage Lecture 480</b><br>
<p>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.htm">Lectures and Seminars</a></h2>
<hr>
<H3>How the U.S. Can Promote Greater Free Trade in Asia</H3>
Robert B. Zoellick Speaking in Heritage's Van Andel Center, November 9, 1994
<P>
<br>
     I would like to thank Heritage for arranging this panel on the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.  I remember discussing
with Treasury Secretary Baker in 1988 the prospect of forming a
similar group for Finance Ministers.  We moved on to other duties that
summer and never had a chance to launch it.  When the Australians and
others launched the APEC idea in 1989, it very much fit our strategic
view.<P>
     I want to focus on three topics.  The first is the strategic
perspective.  The second is the general purposes of APEC.  And the
third is some suggestions on what APEC's future agenda might be.
   <P>  First, on the strategic perspective.  We are at the end of one
era and at the beginning of another.  So it is important to try to
convey to the public a sense of how institutions like NAFTA and APEC
fit together.  While it is perhaps a simplification, I would suggest
that after World War II, the primary strategic objective of U.S. 
foreign policy was to try to transform Western Europe and Japan into
both allies and partners so we could cooperate on a common agenda. 
The three core elements of that strategy were containment of
communism, reconstruction of Western Europe and Japan, and the
creation of a liberal economic order, particularly with respect to
capital and trade flows.
     <P> Today the United States has two similar strategic objectives. 
The first is to ensure that it maintains strong ties with Western
Europe and Japan.  We cannot take those relationships for granted in
the absence of the Cold War glue.  There are many issues on the
horizon that could lead to strains on those relationships.  We also
have the second objective:  to reach out to the next group of
potential partners that can help us in assuming mutual
responsibilities and promoting mutual economic, political, and
security interests.  Not surprisingly, these potential partners are
the nations that are building market economies, civil societies, and
pluralistic and democratic systems.  The obvious candidates are in
Latin America, Central/Eastern Europe, and, of course, East Asia.
    <P> When you look at the world with this framework, you can see the
interconnections between the things that the United States has been
trying to do through NAFTA, the Enterprise for the Americas
Initiative, APEC, the promotion of a special U.S.-EC relationship, and
our suggestions for offering special free trade arrangements to
Central and Eastern Europe.  This is the political economy structure
for U.S.  foreign policy after the Cold War.  It could be a vehicle
for explaining to the American public how these issues relate to one
another.
   <P>  My second topic is the general purposes of APEC.  I believe
regional integration can support ongoing global liberalization. 
Regional integration is natural.  It reflects economic interdependence
and a number of challenges that cross national lines.  However, it is
very important that we make sure that regional initiatives accommodate
other regional efforts and support ongoing, global liberalization. 
The countries of APEC, by and large, have prospered from an open
global economic system.  That system has been the source of much of
their astounding economic growth.  So by their very nature, most APEC
nations remain very oriented toward an open global system. 
    <P> So even though the increased trade and investment flows within
the Pacific basin provide a basis for new regional arrangements, I
think all the countries of Asia recognize that they benefit from a
healthy, global system.  APEC must fit within and support that global
system.  Similarly, it is important to demonstrate how arrangements
like NAFTA, the Asian Free Trade Agreement, or other groups relate to,
and are mutually supportive of, both APEC and the global system.  It
is also important to relate other Asian developments -- for example,
the growth triangle of Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia, or the
economic region of Southern China including Hong Kong -- within this
integrative model.
   <P> NAFTA and APEC can also be employed to develop innovative
liberalizing arrangements that later can be expanded.  Let me cite
from the NAFTA example.  The provisions in NAFTA on intellectual
property, investment, services, and agriculture go far beyond what we
expect to be able to get in the Uruguay Round.  So there is the
possibility that by creating a model with one group of trading
partners, we can move the liberalization agenda ahead in ways that may
be adopted later by others.  APEC offers the same potential.
 <P>    These efforts also help fight protectionism at home.  The OECD
reported recently that over the last ten or twelve years, twenty of
the 24 OECD countries had moved in the direction of trade protection. 
The so-called bicycle theory suggests that if we are unable to move
the trade liberalization agenda forward, then the forces of
protectionism will pull us down.  Regional efforts can keep up the
momentum for liberalization.
  <P>   Another general purpose of APEC is to ensure that the economic
infrastructure of an integrated Pacific community includes the United
States.  There has been a great increase in intra-Asian and trans-
Pacific trade flows.  One statistic really brought this home to me
recently.  The merchandise trade between Singapore and Taiwan and the
United States is now 20 percent greater than the United States'
merchandise trade with Germany.  When you consider how most Americans
perceived Singapore and Taiwan twenty or thirty or even ten years ago,
I think that is a startling fact; I am sure it is one that most
Europeans do not recognize. 
    <P> The decisions we make today about economic infrastructure will
affect patterns of interaction far into the future.  In some ways, the
APEC agenda is a twentieth century analogy to what happened in the
U.S.  West in the nineteenth century.  In that century, the location
of the telegraph lines and railroads influenced the patterns of
communication, the economic flows, and how integration took place. 
Today, in the Pacific, we are determining where the airline routes go,
what telecommunication systems we will use, what languages people will
speak, where students will study, and many other questions that will
set patterns of future interaction.  It is in the interests of America
and of Asia that the U.S.  turn out to be a key part of this
"infrastructure."
    <P> The third purpose of APEC is that good economic ties create a
stronger foundation for America's ongoing security engagement in the
Pacific.  I'll illustrate the point briefly by referencing a comment
made to me by a former Australian Defense Minister.  He said that
today the policy planning staffs throughout East Asia are examining
two questions very seriously.  One is whether they should develop
weapons of mass destruction.  The other is whether they should shift
their conventional forces from internal security to force projection. 
At least in his view, the primary variable in those analyses is
whether the United States maintains a forward deployed presence in
Asia.  I believe, not surprisingly, that it is very important for the
United States to maintain that presence.  I also believe, however,
that it will be very difficult for any administration to maintain that
presence well into the future unless it can demonstrate to the
American people that we have strong economic and political ties to the
region.  So an organization like APEC, or an event like the Seattle
meeting, are ways of getting the message to the American people about
our economic and security interests in the Pacific.
   <P>  One other security point:  economic arrangements within the
Pacific can also support the cooperative security systems that the
Asians are starting to build.  For example, the ASEAN Post-Ministerial
Conference structure has started a security dialogue.  Of course, we
should not overstate the capabilities of these arrangements.  The U.S. 
force presence is going to remain critical for Pacific security. 
Nevertheless, there are areas, such as transparency of defense
budgets, dealing with narcotics problems, piracy, and I hope
proliferation, where Asian cooperation could enable others to share
the load with the U.S.  Cooperation on economic topics can prepare the
way for political and security arrangements.
  <P>   The fourth purpose that I see for APEC is that it can be an
institutional vehicle for supporting U.S.  business.  I will cite one
example.  The United States promoted a telecommunications group, both
because it is important for the region's economic infrastructure, as I
noted earlier, but also because we had very strong business support. 
We tried to involve these U.S.  businesses in the work that we
promoted at APEC.
   <P>  The fifth purpose for APEC has run throughout my comments:  APEC
can affect U.S.  public opinion.  We have extraordinary opportunities
and interests in Asia.  Yet I think that view is not well understood,
particularly on this coast.  An institution like APEC can help get the
message out.  Meetings like the Seattle conference help focus
attention in the United States.
   <P>  The sixth purpose of APEC is to help position the United States
globally.  While many people are anxious about the U.S.  role in the
world, the United States remains the one global power -- whether in
terms of security, economics, or politics.  Our share of world GNP
remains in the low 20s, as it has for about ten or twenty years.  The
United States' interests obviously cannot be restricted to the
Americas, Europe, or, for that matter, Asia.  Our objective should be
to integrate ourselves effectively into all those regions, so as to
enhance our global influence.
  <P>   Finally, I wanted to talk briefly about what should be on APEC's
agenda.  It is important to recognize that APEC's gradual pace of
development has been dictated by practical considerations of the need
to bring our Asian, and particularly ASEAN, partners along.  Singapore
has been a great booster of APEC from the very start, but other ASEAN
countries have worried that APEC might in some way dwarf ASEAN's role. 
They were also concerned about whether the institutionalization of
APEC might create a bureaucracy that could undermine their interests. 
So it took four years to get APEC off the ground. 
   <P>  At this point, APEC needs two things.  First, it needs a vision,
a sense of where it is going.  But APEC also needs practical steps
that will demonstrate how it can achieve goals that will move toward
that vision.  The "Eminent Persons" report is an effort to devise
vision.  Fred Bergsten has been the United States representative. 
From the work that I have seen, I think this group has done a very
good job.  I hope their report will be published, because it can help
launch the debate on APEC's long-term view.
  <P>   My vision is for free trade throughout the Pacific community.  I
realize that this goal will not be easy to achieve.  But I think we
will be better able to organize political and business support in the
United States if we have a sense of where we are going.
  <P>   The near-term agenda for APEC depends a great deal on NAFTA and
the Uruguay Round, not surprisingly given the fact that, at least in
my concept, all of these efforts are related.  In the very near-term,
I continue to think that there is an opportunity for APEC to give a
very needed push to completing the Uruguay Round.  I suggested after
the Tokyo Economic Summit that the U.S.  should send an emissary to
ASEAN and other countries in Asia with a message:  "Now that we have
moved forward the negotiations on market access by coming forward with
a package in Tokyo, it is time for those in Asia who also support free
trade and who want the Uruguay Round to succeed to come up with a
package that we could use at APEC."
    <P> An APEC initiative on the Uruguay Round would be a wonderful
opportunity to demonstrate that APEC stands for something.  It would
also demonstrate something that I think Asians are slow in recognizing
-- that is, the decisions on multi-lateral trade issues are not only
in the hands of the United States, the European Community, and Japan. 
The countries of East Asia are now big enough economically, and
certainly their prospects are sizable enough, that it is very
important that they also make market access offers, particularly in
the services area.  Seattle offers an opportunity for the countries of
APEC to send a signal about their outward orientation by giving the
Uruguay Round a push. 
  <P>   Beyond the Uruguay Round, and I hope beyond the NAFTA, I have a
list of ten items for APEC's future agenda.  I will touch on each, to
give you a sense for future discussions.  Some items are small, to
create movement in the near term.  Some are more ambitious.
     <P>The first is a trade and investment consultation agreement.  It
is still striking that there are many obstacles to trade and
investment that probably nobody really thinks are a good idea, but
have remained in place because countries have not devoted attention to
the detailed work of eliminating them.
   <P>  Second, I would focus on infrastructure developments.  We could
start by following through on the working groups that have been
established in APEC.  These groups deal with topics like
transportation, telecommunications, higher education and training, and
customs processes.  My former colleague, Sandy Kristoff, who is now on
the NSC staff, did a super job of trying to overcome Korean customs
impediments.  A great deal more needs to be done in this area.  In
transportation, for example, we have been trying to overcome barriers
through airline negotiations, which continue to operate through
bilateral agreements.  If the United States and Asian countries are
interested in having more contact, whether by students or
businesspeople, we should welcome competition that will help us lower
air fares.
  <P>   A third item would be mutual recognition of product standards and
testing.  We have launched some efforts in these areas with the EC. 
Some of this work is handled through standards organizations.  But we
could simply start reviewing these items, one by one, particularly in
the area of high technology, to see whether standards or approval
processes are getting in the way of business.
     <P>Fourth, APEC could address items that might fall by the wayside
in the Uruguay Round process.  This agenda might include topics like
government procurement, intellectual property, financial services, and
perhaps competition policies.  We could seek to bring together like-
minded countries to push the liberalization agenda forward,
demonstrate successful records, and then, I hope, bring others along
over time.
     <P>The fifth topic could be an investment code.  It is striking the
degree to which trade now follows investment, as opposed to vice-
versa.  As I recall, over a majority of our trade with Europe
represents intra-company trade flows.  Western Europe and North
America have a very rich exchange of direct investment, but neither
the European Community nor the United States has a similar pattern
with Japan.  This asymmetry of direct investment could be affecting
our trade patterns.
     <P>One might begin with a voluntary investment code.  It could cover
topics like national treatment, transparency, non-discrimination, and
the right of establishment.  All countries, including the U.S., have
some restrictions on foreign investment.  Countries might list those
limits and then use the GATT framework or such an agreement to roll
back those limits over time.
    <P> Investment is also very important to competition in services. 
When you examine how trade agreements deal with services, you observe
that the key to liberalization is to open investment opportunities for
people who want to start service operations in other economies.
    <P> The sixth idea is to involve the finance ministers in macro-
economic discussions.
    <P> Seven, APEC should explore ties with other institutions, for
example, the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and IFC.  To help
avoid making APEC into a bureaucracy, it would be natural to involve
the ADB and others with the infrastructure program.
   <P>  The eighth point would be to continue to involve private
business, for the reasons that I noted.
  <P>   The ninth idea is of a slightly different type, which is to
explore the basis for sub-regional ties.  I know there is some concern
about this in some quarters in Asia, but it would be useful to examine
how the NAFTA and the Asian Free Trade Agreement might be able to
interact to liberalize trade, perhaps ultimately by creating free
trade arrangements between one another.  This would have to be done
carefully so as not to discriminate against others.
    <P> My tenth and final point is to give the APEC ministerials a
particular focus.  For example, if the Ministers launched an agenda
like the one I have outlined, they could review the progress of
specific topics each year.
   <P>  I think that what happens over the next week on NAFTA is going to
go a long way toward determining whether APEC has much life or future. 
I find it striking, as I am sure many of you do, that the President is
working very hard on NAFTA.  But he is struggling to get 100 votes
from his party, when he has 258 in the House of Representatives.  When
the Bush Administration secured fast track negotiating authority, over
the opponents of both NAFTA and the Uruguay Round, we got 93
Democratic votes.  Now I have just got to believe that one way or
another there is the capability to beg, borrow, or steal 100
Democratic votes.  And if they do, I am pretty confident the
Republicans will put up 120. 
   <P>  It would be a tremendously negative signal for everybody around
the world if the President could not get NAFTA through.  It would be a
signal to American politicians, most of whom do not focus on trade
issues, that protectionism was the favored course.  It would be a
signal to countries like France in the Uruguay Round that they would
be nuts to accept a difficult agriculture deal because they couldn't
be sure the Americans could get it through in our own Congress. 
Countries in Asia would say, "Why should we be making arrangements
with a country that can't do the sensible thing with 90 million people
on its border."  The ramifications of this, not only for economics,
but for foreign policy and security policy, are absolutely enormous.

<title>Gary Bauer's December, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

December 6, 1996

<p><br><br>

<ul><ul>

<i>It was a great comfort to feel, all during the
last days when affairs looked doubtful, that no matter how things
came out the really important thing was the lovely life I have
with mother and with you children and that compared to this home
life everything else was of small importance from the stand point
of happiness.

Theodore Roosevelt<br>
from a letter to his son Kermit<br>
1904</i>

</ul></ul></ul></ul>

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

Christmas comes to Washington, D.C., much the
same way it comes to your hometown.  Street lights come on earlier,
stores stay open later, there are smiles on more faces, and bell-ringing
members of the Salvation Army brave the cold and take up their
posts.  Around the city seasonal decorations are hung from every
pillar and post, multi-colored bulbs burn in windows and on trees.
Fervent prayers for safe travel go forth, as we remember Christmases
past and eagerly anticipate the arrival of family members, including
sons and daughters from college or military assignments around
the globe.

<p>

Yes, Christmas comes to Washington as it does
to every other city, but it comes here with a rather peculiar
force.  Partly it's because of the history of our nation's capital,
but even more significantly, I think, it's because of the political
nature of this city.  Throughout most of the year, an air of aggressive
secularity reigns in Washington.  Faith is not absent here, but
it too often takes a backseat to the public business being conducted.
Not so at Christmas-time, however.  As an anonymous writer once
noted about Christmas in Washington, &quot;Officially, the government
of the United States does not celebrate religious holidays.  Unofficially,
of course, it does.&quot;

<p>

That &quot;unofficial&quot; celebration of the
birth of Christ has irresistible power.  The white columns of
government buildings are festooned with wreaths and ribbons.
Christmas trees are lit at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
On the open Ellipse just south of the White House the National
Christmas Tree stands proudly, established by President Calvin
Coolidge and lit every year since 1923.  Each year, thousands
of visitors come to visit the tree and to see the life-sized Nativity
scene that even the Scrooges at the ACLU have been unable to dislodge.

<p>

On one occasion our National Christmas Tree
was nearly darkened -- not by church-and-state lawyers, but by
the nightmare of a nation at war.  On December 7, 1941, Japanese
forces attacked Pearl Harbor.  America entered the war and Nazi
Germany and Fascist Italy declared war upon us.  In those first
days of the conflict blackouts were declared along the East Coast
as American leaders feared the worst.

<p>

In Washington, too, a blackout was ordered.
Our military and the Secret Service compiled a list of actions
they wanted taken to protect the Executive Mansion and the Congress,
including even the repainting of the White House in standard Army
Air Corps camouflage.  President Franklin Roosevelt resisted many
of their recommendations, rightly sensing that they would seriously
depress the indomitable American spirit.  But one security demand
made him bristle the most:  <I>no Christmas Tree on the Ellipse</I>,
the agencies said, <I>it would be too obvious a target</I>.

<p>

But Roosevelt refused to give in, and on Christmas
Eve, 1941, President and Mrs. Roosevelt stood on the south portico
of the White House and threw a switch to light the National Christmas
Tree, as a national radio audience tuned their receivers.  In
the midst of the blackout, the tree provided the only light for
miles around.  Beside the Roosevelts on the portico stood Winston
Churchill, who had traveled secretly to Washington and arrived
only that morning to encourage his American partners.  That night,
the British leader delivered a message that captured the essence
of the symbol Roosevelt was defending in lighting the tree.  Churchill
spoke to (and for) all Americans when he said:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Let the children have their night of laughter . . . Let us
grown-ups share . . . in their unstinted pleasures
before we turn again to the stern tasks and the formidable
years that lie before us, resolved that by our sacrifice
and daring these same children shall not be robbed
of their inheritance or denied their right to live in
a free and decent world.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Today, of course, the clouds of war are not
gathered on every side.  But Churchill's words, and the meaning
of Christmas, retain all of their urgency.  Sacrifice and daring
are still needed in this fight, fought with words of persuasion
and prayers of petition, for the right of our children and our
grandchildren to live in a free and decent world.  If I have any
goal at the Family Research Council, it is to continue to frustrate
the Scrooges and the nay-sayers by keeping the lights burning
brightly on the Christmas trees of family, faith and freedom all
throughout this great land.

<p>

Christmas truly is the feast of childhood.
On this holy day, we mark the event where our God in heaven came
to us as a child, with a message that we must come to Him as children
if we want to see His face.  The words of Teddy Roosevelt that
I quoted at the beginning of this letter offer us another reminder
of the meaning of our work in this life.  Teddy was a remarkable
president, but an excellent book about him called <I>A Bully Father</I>
reminds us of the priorities that ruled his life even in the midst
of political turmoil. Teddy Roosevelt placed his family first,
no matter what the season.

<p>

His ardent devotion to conservation led him
to refuse to place a freshly cut Christmas tree in the White House.
But during his White House years he turned a blind eye when his
sons carried a tree up into the residence and hid it in their
closet.  On Christmas morning, his letters to his children reveal,
he rejoiced in the family custom of gathering in his and Edith's
bedroom as the six children romped and peered into their stockings
and opened their presents.  These events recalled for TR &quot;just
such a Christmas&quot; as he had known in his youth, and it was
&quot;just such a Christmas&quot; he endeavored to reproduce exactly
for his own family.

<p>

This Christmas season, I'm sure your family
has its own traditions to relive, customs you seek to renew time
and time again.  It doesn't really seem to matter what they are:
large or small, children remember and treasure each one.  My prayer
is that you will enjoy each and every moment that you have together.

<p>

For my family, Christmas will be particularly
special this year.  For a short while, life once again will be
exactly as it was ... Carol and me coming down the stairs each
morning to find all of our children under our roof.  Our daughter
Elyse will be home from college after a long semester.  She hasn't
chosen a major yet, but increasingly she feels drawn toward political
science and law.  On campus, she really enjoys her involvement
in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.  Our high school sophomore,
Sarah, is learning to drive.  In addition to that excitement,
every Tuesday she and a dozen classmates gather at our house at
6:30 in the morning to pray and share their love for God and His
Son Jesus Christ.  Our son, Zachary, just celebrated his 10th
birthday.  He continues to grow in his faith, while he uses his
God-given talents and abilities to play every sport possible.
His soccer season just ended and basketball practice has already
begun.

<p>

Now that I have filled you in on my family,
it occurs to me that we would like to have an update from you, too. 
A few years ago, I asked readers of my monthly letter to send us
a family picture and tell us about their family.  We still treasure
the pictures and letters we received.  With permission, many of
those letters and the incidents they relate have found a place
in one of our publications, like <I>Reunion</I> or <I>Let Freedom
Ring</I>, or in the military exhibit at our new location in 
Washington.

<p>

If you have a moment -- perhaps while you're
sending out your Christmas cards or in the quieter days after
Christmas -- could you send us an updated photograph and tell
us how your family is doing?  If you haven't written before or
are new to my letters, we're all the more anxious to learn something
about you and your family.  Your photos and letters mean a lot
to all of us at FRC.  They remind us, just as Teddy Roosevelt's
letter to Kermit does, why we're here and whom we represent. They
also remind us that our happiness rests on a foundation that no
one can take away.

<p>

Thank you for all you do in partnership with
us to help build and preserve that &quot;free and decent world&quot;
of which Churchill spoke.  Next month, I'll be writing to share
with you the specific policy steps we will be pursuing with the
105th Congress to help achieve that &quot;world&quot; -- steps
to protect the sanctity of human life, to clean up our polluted
culture, to ease the economic pressures on families, and to promote
education reforms that help ensure that every child hears the
kind of historical truths that are recounted in this letter.

<p>

From all of us at FRC to all of yours, both near
and far, we wish you a peaceful and blessed Christmas.  May God
be with you this holiday season and throughout the coming year.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S.  End-of-year gifts represent a major portion
of the funds the Family Research Council receives from our supporters.
As you consider the gifts you intend to make this Christmas,
I sincerely hope you will consider FRC worthy of your continued
support.

<h3><i>AMERICA'S STAKE IN HONG KONG</i></h3>

Asian Studies Center Backgrounder #137<br>
October 2, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	The strong showing of pro-democracy candidates in this month's legislative election in Hong Kong is a clear signal that the people do not trust Beijing's pledges to respect their autonomy and freedoms. Hong Kong residents voted overwhelmingly for pro-democracy candidates out of fear that China will scrap their democratic freedoms and legal system after Hong Kong reverts to China in 1997. For the first time, Hong Kong's entire 60-seat Legislative Council (LegCo) was elected at one time. Pro-democratic forces now constitute a working majority, but Beijing has promised to dissolve the LegCo when it takes over Hong Kong's government.
<p>
	The British territory of Hong Kong will become a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997. The transfer from British to Chinese rule was agreed upon in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration,1 which provides autonomy to Hong Kong residents in local government, economic, social, and cultural affairs for at least fifty years after reversion. During this time, Hong Kong's government and courts are to remain intact, although China will assume control of Hong Kong's security and foreign affairs. The Basic Law,2 Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution, mandates that China will refrain from imposing its socialist policies on Hong Kong and pledges to respect the Joint Declaration's guarantees of local government autonomy and an independent judiciary.
<p>
	Notwithstanding Beijing's assurances, America's political and economic interests in Hong Kong are significant and will endure. American corporations' multibillion-dollar investments and their use of Hong Kong as a regional operations center can continue only if Hong Kong remains as open and free as it is today.
<p>
	Hong Kong is America's 12th-largest trading partner, with 1994 two-way trade in excess of $21 billion.3 The U.S. enjoys an annual trade surplus with Hong Kong of nearly $2 billion which is expected to rise as American technology and service-related industries commit themselves more deeply to the region and join the over 1,000 American businesses already there. The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong is the largest outside of the U.S.
<p>
	American economic interests in Hong Kong are built on its respect for the rule of law, which serves as the guardian of economic and political freedom. The U.S. therefore has a direct interest in Beijing's compliance with its pledges to respect Hong Kong's autonomy. Only if the rule of law continues can residents' freedom be protected and the economy continue to flourish.
<p>
	The United States has an interest in seeing both the Joint Declaration and Basic Law implemented. These instruments provide the framework for a smooth and comprehensive transfer of sovereignty in 1997. They guarantee that Hong Kong will remain not only a leading international business center, but also a free society. The critical conditions of the Basic Law that Beijing must respect after 1997 include:
<p><ul>
<li>Continuation of Hong Kong's autonomy and prosperity;
<p>
<li>The existence of a free market;
<p>
<li>Commitment to such democratic and open institutions as a free press;
<p>
<li>Preservation of Hong Kong's apolitical, independent civil service;
<p>
<li>The rule of law built upon the inviolability of human rights and civil liberties;
<p>
<li>Maintenance of Hong Kong's independence in fiscal and taxation matters; and
<p>
<li>Cooperation between Hong Kong and foreign law enforcement authorities.4</ul><p><b>THE COURT OF FINAL APPEAL</b><p>	The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) will replace the United Kingdom's Privy Council as Hong Kong's final appeals court. On June 9, 1995, the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, established in 1985 to implement the Joint Declaration, reached agreement on the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong.5 It is envisaged that the CFA will provide continuity in the rule of law.<p>	Supporters of the Court deal, most notably in Hong Kong's international business community, argue that it "sweeps away the uncertainty, for people and businesses, here and abroad, about a gap in the judicial system."6  Critics, such as Democratic Party leader Martin Lee and Hong Kong's Bar Association, accuse Britain of appeasing China.7 Lee condemns the agreement as the "final nail in Hong Kong's coffin."8<p>	This deal is not without shortcomings. Most disturbing is that the Court of Final Appeal will be established not before the 1997 reversion, but immediately after the transfer of government authority to Beijing.9 Therefore, the danger exists that Beijing will not permit a truly independent judiciary.10 The Basic Law, drafted and approved by China, stipulates that China's National People's Congress will retain control over "acts of state," or "affairs that are the responsibility of the Chinese government."  Beijing could exploit this language to reverse decisions reached by the Court of Final Appeal.<p><b>PROTECTING AND ADVANCING AMERICAN INTERESTS</b>
<p>
	Against a backdrop of growing uncertainty over Hong Kong's future, Congress in October 1992 adopted the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act, which defines America's economic, political, and human rights interests in Hong Kong and requires the State Department to report to Congress on these issues. The Act categorically states American support for Hong Kong's continued participation in international organizations after 1997 and asserts that the U.S. should regard Hong Kong as autonomous in all economic and trade matters.11 It also specifies that U.S. laws "shall continue to apply with respect to Hong Kong, on and after July 1, 1997... unless otherwise expressly provided by law or by Executive order."12<p>	Given continuing concerns over the fate of the recently elected Legislative Council, as well as over the future of democracy and the rule of law in Hong Kong, the U.S. should work during the remaining months of this transitional period to support American interests and strengthen Hong Kong's ability to shape its own future. Thus, the Administration should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Firmly support Hong Kong's free enterprise system.</b> Hong Kong symbolizes the free-market system. In a recent Heritage Foundation study, <a href="econ_index/toc.html.cgi"><i>The Index of Economic Freedom</i></a>, Hong Kong far outstripped most of its competitors to place first in a global ranking of economic freedoms.13 But unless free-market policies and a strong, reliable system of dispute resolution continue after 1997, Hong Kong cannot retain its economic freedom and entrepreneurial dynamism. Should the rule of law be replaced by the rule of personal connections, which is often the practice in the PRC, Hong Kong's prosperity will be threatened.
<p>
<li><b>Urge China not to dismantle Hong Kong's Legislative Council.</b> The current Legislative Council, elected on September 17, 1995, should be allowed to serve out its entire four-year term free of any disruption brought about by reversion to Chinese sovereignty. Beijing remains committed to nominating a provisional council to oversee Hong Kong after reversion. This would violate Beijing's commitment to non-interference in Hong Kong's affairs, sabotage international confidence in Hong Kong, and disappoint the expectations of its residents. The U.S. should communicate to China that a popularly supported legislative body is crucial to Hong Kong's future. The overwhelming victory won by pro-democracy candidates in the recent election emphasizes the need for LegCo's continued, uninterrupted existence.
<p>
<li><b>Continue U.S. Navy port calls to Hong Kong while not accepting a new Chinese consulate in Honolulu.</b> Hong Kong has been a free port for visits by 60 to 70 U.S. Navy ships a year. These visits should be continued. They demonstrate America's engagement in the region, support the American position in Hong Kong, and provide evidence of a stable relationship with the PRC. The U.S. Navy resumed port calls to the Chinese mainland earlier this year, showing a commitment to a better U.S.-China relationship and removing a key obstacle to continuation of port calls to Hong Kong. However, the U.S. should rebuff China's attempt to trade acceptance of American port calls in Hong Kong for establishment of a Chinese consulate in Honolulu. It clearly is not in America's interest to allow China an official presence in such a militarily sensitive area, from which it could monitor U.S. naval movements in the Pacific.
<p>
<li><b>Speak out in favor of a professional, non-biased civil service in Hong Kong after 1997.</b> Hong Kong's professional civil service is regarded as one of the keys to the territory's success. Its ability to remain impartial and unbiased during the run-up to 1997 will ensure a smooth and stable transition, and its continued existence after reversion will enhance confidence in Hong Kong's future.
<p>
<li><b>Continue to support Hong Kong's participation in international organizations that do not require sovereignty for membership.</b> Hong Kong has played a valuable role in the World Trade Organization, the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and other international organizations. Its membership in these organizations should continue after 1997. Hong Kong's autonomous voice in these organizations has opened the door for free-market reforms in China and throughout Asia.
<p>
<li><b>Continue high-level visits to Hong Kong.</b> Visits of high-level Americans to Hong Kong after reversion would help cement the U.S.-Hong Kong bilateral relationship and would provide an excellent forum in which the remaining agreements, including those on extradition and investment, can be established with the Hong Kong SAR after 1997. High-level visits also send a message to Beijing that Hong Kong is important to American interests throughout Asia.
<p>
<li><b>Urge China to protect human rights in Hong Kong.</b> The uncertainty over Hong Kong's future requires constant vigilance on the part of the international community. The United Nations requires the United Kingdom to report to the U.N.'s Human Rights Committee on Hong Kong's human rights record. But China is not a member of the committee, so these reports will end after the 1997 transfer. Because China remains unwilling to enter into the U.N. covenant on human rights, the U.S. should continue to press China either to enter into the covenant or to allow Hong Kong to enter and report on human rights after 1997.
<p>
<li><b>Insist that U.S. law enforcement agreements with Hong Kong continue.</b> Cooperation between Hong Kong and American law enforcement agencies has been one of long-standing goodwill and mutual benefit. Washington should ask that this cooperation continue after 1997. An extradition agreement with the Hong Kong authorities is nearing completion and soon will be placed before the U.S. Senate for ratification. The U.S. has worked with mainland authorities to control illegal narcotics, money laundering, and organized crime. This cooperation not only should continue after reversion, but should be intensified.
<p>
<li><b>Complete negotiations on outstanding U.S.-Hong Kong agreements.</b>The three most important outstanding agreements involve extradition, civil aviation, and bilateral investment. The extradition agreement awaits final PRC approval within the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG). A civil aviation agreement has not yet been reached, and no new negotiations are planned. Completion of the investment agreement is mired in questions of format. The U.S. has a standard draft that it wishes to advance, while Hong Kong has its own model text from which it wants to develop an agreement. Negotiations are scheduled for later this year. The U.S. should strive to complete these agreements as soon as possible. They would relax barriers to American business in the region, increase official interaction with Hong Kong, and help ensure Hong Kong's autonomy after 1997. Some were drafted directly with Hong Kong authorities, others with the United Kingdom under an "entrustment" clause. Under international law, the latter agreements will lapse upon Hong Kong's reversion in 1997. It is in the interests of both sides to see them replaced with a new agreement before such a lapse occurs.
<p>
<li><b>Encourage China to prepare a post-1997 travel document for Hong Kong residents.</b> Hong Kong's ability to remain a vibrant center of international commerce is only as strong as its residents' ability to travel abroad without undue interference. Without a document that allows them to travel abroad, Hong Kong's businessmen and women will lose to competitors, causing a natural erosion in the territory's competitive edge. Until the 1997 reversion, the U.S. should continue to recognize Hong Kong residents' British National Overseas (BNO) and British Dependent Territories Citizen (BDTC) passports as legal travel documents. In the meantime, Washington should urge Beijing to prepare travel documents for Hong Kong residents that respect their right to travel freely. Such freedom is vital to the continuation of Hong Kong as a business center.
<p>
<li><b>Continue U.S.-sponsored international academic programs in Hong Kong.</b> The United States Information Agency's International Visitor Program, the Fulbright Program, and a host of unofficial academic exchanges strengthen American educational and cultural links to Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government has shown an interest in funding the development of a Hong Kong-American Center devoted to fostering academic ties. This effort should be encouraged by the U.S. It would increase American involvement after 1997 without adding significantly to U.S. government costs.
<p>
<li><b>Prevail upon Beijing to keep its promise of eventual universal suffrage in Hong Kong.</b>14 This promise was written into the Chinese-crafted Basic Law. If honored, it would provide a further measure of confidence in Beijing's willingness to respect Hong Kong's autonomy. Furthermore, it would give residents of Hong Kong greater confidence in their ability to shape their own future. Failure to provide residents a say in their political system would cause the middle class to flee and dampen the enthusiasm felt by international businesses for Hong Kong.
<p>
<li><b>Maintain an active consulate general up to and after 1997.</b> The American diplomatic presence in Hong Kong should not be scaled back just to defer to Beijing's wishes. Given American economic interests and numerous bilateral programs, it is natural that the U.S. government should remain committed to operating in Hong Kong. America's Hong Kong policy should be run from Hong Kong, not from Beijing. Therefore, the U.S. should maintain a consulate office in Hong Kong after 1997.
<p>
<li><b>Urge resolution of the dispute over Container Terminal 9.</b> The delay in construction of Container Terminal 9 (CT9), a major infrastructure project at the port of Hong Kong, directly affects American economic interests. It is key to Hong Kong's ability to compete as a regional shipping and business center. The U.S. stake in the project is significant because a major American firm, Sea-Land Services Inc., has based a large part of its presence in Asia on the project's completion. The U.S. should make it clear to both Britain and the PRC that resolution of this dispute, which arose mainly over inclusion of the British Jardines Matheson consortium, would benefit all parties and ease the shipping bottleneck that already threatens to blunt Hong Kong's competitive edge over other ports in the region.
</ul><p>


<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	Even in an area as economically vibrant as East Asia, Hong Kong stands out as a tremendous free-market success. Through its dynamism, free-market policies, entrepeneurship, and rule of law, Hong Kong has transformed itself into something much more than a successful economic center of six million people. It has become the focal point for social and economic development within China and in many ways is an inspiration to other countries in the region as well.
<p>
	All of this will be jeopardized if Beijing fails to honor its promises after 1997. China's threats to dismantle the LegCo and run Hong Kong as it sees fit have eroded confidence in Hong Kong's future. And because the fate of Hong Kong will continue to be a factor in shaping American views of China, erosion of faith in the U.S.-China relationship is inevitable if Beijing breaks its word.
<p>
	As this century draws to a close, China's emergence as a major global power will play a larger role in determining the American course of action in Asia. China's deeds and words carry growing weight. Its threats regarding Hong Kong's future autonomy, and the direct effect these threats have on American interests in Hong Kong, cannot be ignored. In addition to being an important economic interest of the United States, a prosperous and autonomous Hong Kong represents a test of China's intentions and behavior, both in Asia and in the rest of the world.

<p>
 <a name="intro"><h4>INTRODUCTION</h4></a>
<p>
[ <a href="#cont">Contents</a> ]
<p>
In contrast to his mishandling of relations with Japan and China, President Bill Clinton advanced American interests in Asia with his July 11 executive order to establish formal diplomatic relations with Vietnam. Opening formal relations with Vietnam not only will allow the United States to increase trade with that country, but may in the long run encourage Vietnam to move away from Communism. A prosperous and free Vietnam could become a valuable friend in Asia for the United States. 
<p>
For this to occur, however, the Clinton Administration needs to fashion a strategy that goes beyond normalization and advances American interests in the region. Such a strategy should include continued efforts to resolve the disposition of Americans listed as missing in action during the war with Vietnam; promoting an expansion of economic freedom in Vietnam to allow for greater American trade and investment; promoting political freedom by helping Vietnam evolve from its communist political system; and supporting democratic reform in Cambodia as an example for Vietnam's future.
<p>
<a name="norm"><h4>WHY NORMALIZATION BENEFITS AMERICA </h4></a>
<p>
[ <a href="#cont">Contents</a> ]
<p>
While establishing diplomatic relations with Vietnam is discomforting to many Americans, doing so now advances American goals in Asia. First, it acknowledges that Vietnam has taken concrete steps to respond to the "roadmap" for normalization outlined by President George Bush in 1991. These include offering assistance, beginning in 1988, in resolving the fate of over 1,618 Americans listed as missing in action during the war; the withdrawal of its troops from Cambodia in 1989; and the settlement of American property claims in 1994. Normalization at this time also sends an important message to China and North Korea: Relations with the U.S. can improve if a country stops threatening its neighbors and satisfies American concerns. 
<p>
Second, a formal relationship with Vietnam will enable the United States to pursue its economic interests in expanding trade and investment opportunities for American business. Vietnam's market of 70 million consumers remains highly underdeveloped, but economic reforms begun in 1989 are rapidly opening the Southeast Asian country to global commerce. Vietnam may spend an estimated $7 billion on infrastructure projects over the next five years. American brands, technology, and expertise are in demand. Of the $14 billion that other countries have invested in Vietnam, the U.S. accounts for the eighth largest share. About 300 American companies have opened offices in Vietnam since the 1994 lifting of the U.S. trade embargo. Now that diplomatic relations have been established, the process of granting most-favored-nation trading status will begin. This process will offer the United States opportunities to convince Vietnam to increase economic freedom by reducing barriers to trade and investment.
<p>
Third, a normal relationship will enable the U.S. to advance its concerns about the status of human rights in Vietnam and eventually to support Vietnamese who may press for greater political freedoms. Vietnam's communist regime wants to promote economic growth and suppress political freedom. As has been the experience with other communist regimes, this is very difficult to sustain in the long term. Vietnam also may learn that totalitarian or even authoritarian control is incompatible with economic growth.
<p>
<a name="strat"><h4>A STRATEGY FOR FUTURE RELATIONS </h4></a>
<p>
[ <a href="#cont">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Future relations with Vietnam will present major challenges for American policy. The Hanoi regime has proven to be tenacious and stubborn in war and peace; future relations may entail considerable friction. Washington must craft a long-term strategy to advance U.S. economic and political goals with Vietnam while realizing that their attainment may take many years. Such a strategy should include:
<p>
<a name="reso"><b>Resolving the MIA question.</b></a><br>
Washington should tell Hanoi that it must continue to cooperate to the maximum extent possible in resolving the question of American servicemen missing from the war. This is a humanitarian concern that transcends all other issues in the relationship. Of the 2,202 Americans missing from the war, 1,618 were lost in Vietnam. This year the U.S. Joint Task Force-Full Accounting, which is leading the effort to investigate the fate of MIAs and recover their remains, will spend about $100 million. This effort should be continued. Despite increased cooperation by Hanoi in recent years, Hanoi's actions over the history of the MIA issue fuel continued suspicion that it has not divulged all relevant information. Washington should continue to press Hanoi and Moscow -- Hanoi's former ally -- to release all relevant records, including internal government documents, pertaining to missing Americans. 
<p>
<a name="expa"><b>Expanding economic freedom.</b></a><br>
Washington should use every opportunity to encourage Vietnam's leaders to expand economic freedom. Only greater economic freedom will sustain Vietnam's economic growth. As recently as 1978, Vietnam tried to abolish private enterprise; but in 1986, out of grave necessity, it embarked on a market reform program. The reforms proved effective, reversing chronic food shortages and leading to greater openness to foreign investment. However, Vietnam still maintains many barriers to trade and investment that must be addressed as the United States considers not only conferring most-favored-nation trade status, but whether to admit Vietnam to the World Trade Organization. Vietnam has only 6,300 private enterprises, and all but two percent of foreign joint ventures are contracted with state-owned firms. Investors face daunting barriers: arbitrary laws and regulations, a ponderously slow bureaucracy, and pervasive corruption. In the Heritage Foundation's <i>Index of Economic Freedom,</i> Vietnam ranks number 99 in economic freedoms out of 101 countries surveyed. As a consequence, most Vietnamese are very poor; average per capita annual income is about $200. 
<p>
Vietnam will join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this month. ASEAN (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand), formed in 1967 in part to oppose communist expansion, now promotes the common political and economic interests of its members. Vietnam wants to join an impending ASEAN Free Trade Area, which will require Hanoi to lower tariffs to 5 percent by the year 2007. While welcoming Vietnam's intention to join the ASEAN Free Trade Area, Washington should press Hanoi to make trade and investment rules more transparent, simplify investment procedures, rapidly privatize state-owned enterprises, and accelerate tariff reductions. 
<p>
<a name="prpo"><b>Promoting political freedom.</b></a><br>
Washington should begin a campaign to promote political freedom in Vietnam. Vietnamese themselves inevitably will demand such freedom as a consequence of economic growth, greater contact with foreigners, and Vietnamese exiles' returning to do business. Today, however, the Vietnamese Communist Party insists on total control of political power. There is no rule of law, no freedom to oppose the government, no free press, no freedom of assembly, and the government closely monitors religious groups. Dissidents are regularly jailed. 
<p>
After attending the annual ASEAN meeting of foreign ministers at the end of July, Secretary of State Warren Christopher intends to visit Hanoi. Christopher should begin a dialogue with Vietnamese officials at the ASEAN meeting, to be continued in Hanoi, urging greater tolerance of political freedom. In future meetings, U.S. officials should tell their Vietnamese counterparts that they will not be able fully to join Asia's rapid economic growth until economic liberalization incorporates greater political freedom.
<p>
Washington should move cautiously in developing any strategic relationship with Hanoi. While the United States and Vietnam oppose China's territorial claims to the South China Sea, the U.S. should resist the temptation to build up Vietnam as a counter to China. Vietnam and China will remain traditional adversaries regardless of the extent of U.S.-Vietnamese ties. Potential U.S.-Vietnam military cooperation could suffer the same fate as U.S.-China military relations: military ties built during the 1980s to counter the Soviet Union were dashed in 1989 over human rights issues. U.S.-Vietnamese military-to-military contacts already are extensive over the MIA issue. Today, however, Vietnam has closer political relations with Cuba and Iraq than with the United States. A useful military relationship with Vietnam may not be possible until it evolves significantly away from communism. 
<p>
<a name="prfe"><b>Promoting freedom in Cambodia.</b></a><br>
To provide a positive example of life after communism for Vietnam's leaders, the U.S. should work to consolidate Cambodia's tentative transition from communist rule to democracy, and to promote sustained economic growth. Vietnam put the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) in power after its military occupation of Cambodia in 1979. In 1993 the CPP lost United Nations-sponsored elections, but today the CPP dominates a coalition government in Cambodia. Washington should strongly urge the CPP-dominated government to resist such authoritarian measures as a pending law that threatens to curb press freedoms and cease measures to suppress opposition politicians like Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy. 
<p>
<a name="conc"><h4>CONCLUSION </h4></a>
<p>
[ <a href="#cont">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Normal relations with Vietnam will disappoint many Americans, especially those who made great sacrifices during the war and believe that Vietnam's communist regime was and remains untrustworthy. Yet twenty years after America's withdrawal from South Vietnam, it is becoming clear that America's sacrifice -- including the lives of 58,128 servicemen -- was not in vain. The Hanoi regime's totalitarian control is eroding as it surrenders power out of necessity to capitalist forces of trade and foreign investment. 
<p>
The United States must plan to promote not only economic freedom in Vietnam, but political freedom as well. This process may take many years and cause great friction with Vietnam. But there are better prospects now to realize America's original goal: a free Vietnam that becomes a valued economic and political partner in Asia. If this occurs, the Vietnam War may turn out to have been only a lost battle. The forces of freedom and democracy for which America fought will prevail.

<P><h2><center>
NEW ZEALAND: A BLUEPRINT FOR ECONOMIC REFORM</h2></center><p>

Delivered June 16, 1995 by His Excellency John Wood, Ambassador of New Zealand to the United States. 
<P>
	I had hoped to talk to you this afternoon about the America's Cup. But my staff have told me that I've done that subject to death, that Americans don't really want to hear any more about New Zealand winning yachting's greatest prize, and that I might actually get a better reception at The Heritage Foundation for one of my other favorite topics -- farming without subsidies.
<p>
	Actually, today I'd like to talk to you about the economic transformation of New Zealand that has occurred over the last decade.
<p>
	New Zealand at the time of the Korean War was among the five wealthiest countries in the world. By the late '70s, we had fallen to near 20th. New Zealand had one of the poorest performing economies of the Western world; had not dealt well with the oil shocks; had high tariff and other import barriers, high levels of farm subsidies, a national debt that was approaching Third World proportions, a top tax rate of 66 percent; a gold-plated welfare system that the country could no longer afford. From 1975 to 1983, the economy barely grew; the only thing that grew was unemployment -- from 0 percent to 5 percent. 
<p>
	In other words, we were as tightly regulated, protected, and centralized as any East European country, and performing about as well. If we'd been a company, we would have been bankrupt, or at the least operating under Chapter 11!
<p>
	In 1984 a period of reform started which has been described by the OECD as the most comprehensive undertaken by any Western country in recent decades. I've said a little bit about how we got into the mess. How did we get out of it?  What are the results today?
<p>

<b>PRECONDITIONS FOR REFORM</b><p>
	There were three critical preconditions for reform:
<P>
First, in 1984 there was an acute sense of crisis in the country at large.
<p>
Second, there was a consensus among New Zealand's professional leadership, both public and private sector, that drastic and comprehensive change was necessary, that no single interest group should be immune from change or should be permitted to dictate the agenda. An intellectual basis for change was provided by a key group of officials in the Treasury, drawing in part on their exposure to academic debate in the United States. A change of government in 1984 brought to power a Labor government that was a generation younger than its predecessor, of liberal persuasion and professional background, and willing to embrace change. They took the view that ideas, productive energies, and confidence for New Zealand to make its way in the world would only emerge from opening all sectors of the economy to the forces of competition.
<P>
Third, there was a realization that no one else was going to help us. There was no fairy godmother out there willing and able to shore up our currency, extend our debt raising capacity, or anything else. We were in trouble, in part of our own making. We had to get out of it ourselves.

<P>
<b>WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?<br></b><p>
<b>Financial Sector
</B><p>
	The foreign exchange crisis at the time of the change of government led to a decision to massively devalue the currency, then free float the exchange rate, and then to comprehensively deregulate the financial sector. With foreign exchange controls lifted, new banks were allowed to operate.
<p>

<b>Agriculture</b>
<P>
	Let me spend a little time here even though I appreciate that I may be speaking to the converted, given the position that has been taken in The Heritage Foundation's publications. But let me explain how we got rid of the sacred cows -- not the other ones, but the sacred ones.
<P>
	Farm production and processing account for nearly 12 percent of New Zealand's GDP. Two-thirds of total farm output is exported, earning 60 percent of total export revenue. Agriculture is too big to be carried by the rest of the economy. Assistance to New Zealand's farmers peaked in 1984, contributing to 30 percent of total agricultural output. That was  unsustainable. One year later, almost all subsidies were gone, and the rest went soon after.
<P>
	There are now no subsidies and no other forms of assistance except for spending on inspection, quarantine, research, and pest control. New Zealand's farmers are fully exposed to market forces. New Zealand's agricultural sector is by far the least assisted in the OECD. Government support to farming fell from a peak of 30 percent in 1984 to 3 percent in 1990.
<P>
	It was not a painless process. Market land values fell by 22 percent during 1982-1988 (indicating the extent to which government support for agriculture was capitalized into farm land values). Overseas markets worsened in the late 1980s, mostly due to the subsidized overproduction of pastoral products in OECD countries.
<P>
	Nonetheless, the main farmers organization supported the reforms (provided they were implemented throughout the economy, thus lowering farmers' costs of production). Farmers adjusted rapidly to liberalization. Very few were forced out -- only about 800, or 1 percent. Farming contracted at the margins (marginal land use, excessive debt loads, and/or incompetence), not across the board. Lurid depictions of rural collapse never became a reality.
<P>
	Now farmers' real net incomes have returned to the level prevailing in the early 1980s. Farmers have become more innovative and more responsive to markets and allocate their  resources more efficiently. They have developed new markets.
<P>
	Some in the U.S. have suggested that there was a drop in agricultural output. That is misleading. The pattern of farm output changed, reflecting more efficient allocation of resources. For example, there was a trend away from traditional pastoral farming, where most subsidies were once directed (sheep numbers fell from 70 million in 1982 to 50 million today) into a range of areas such as horticulture, forestry, and cattle.
<P>
	No New Zealand farmers are calling for a return to the bad old days of government support. New Zealand farmers earn their living by their own efforts, without interference. That independence is now fiercely defended by rural people. New Zealand's experience shows that it is possible for farmers to live well and prosper following the loss of government assistance despite the agricultural support policies of other countries, including the U.S., which distort and limit international trade.
<P><b>Trade</b><P>
	Tariffs in New Zealand were reduced to one-third of what they had previously been. New Zealand consciously opened up its market to imports and international competition. Even after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, New Zealand unilaterally announced a further series of tariff reductions up to the year 2000 in areas as sensitive as textiles, clothing, and footwear. Over 90 percent of all imports now enter New Zealand free of any quota, duty, or other restriction. In the meantime, New Zealand's manufacturing base has flourished. Our total exports of all goods increased 5 percent in 1994; manufactured goods increased by 7 percent. I know this kind of action is commonly referred to as unilateral disarmament in this country. We simply don't see it that way. We weren't seeking to convey unrequited benefits to anyone else, but to do ourselves a favor.
<P>

<b>Market Reforms</b>
	The public sector in New Zealand used to run everything from the railways to electricity generation, the telecommunications sector, a savings bank, the coal mines. The government used to build all the roads and dams. Some estimates suggest that the government was involved in 60 percent of the economy, certainly in almost all major investment decisions.
<P>
	In 1984, the government adopted the principle that the state should not be involved in any activities that could be more efficiently and effectively run by the private sector. The first step was corporatization through the State Owned Enterprises Act of 1986, which involved getting enterprises run on a commercial basis, freeing them from government red tape, putting a private sector board in charge, removing political interference, requiring them to make a profit. This often meant setting clear, unambiguous goals. For example, the Forest Service was never sure whether its main purpose was to plant and harvest trees profitably or to provide jobs. Corporatization removed that conflict.
<P>
	The second step was privatization, or selling the enterprise and removing the government as an owner. An important principle that was at the heart of the privatization process was minimum regulation but maximum competition. There was no desire to substitute private sector monopoly for government monopoly. The government therefore sought to put in place a framework that would generate competition.
<P>
	One of the best examples is in the field of telecommunications, with corporatization in 1987 and privatization in 1990. The proceeds of NZ$4.250 billion were used to retire the debt. Telecom New Zealand had 26,500 employees; it now has 9,300. There is competition from MCI on long distance, from Bell South on cellular. Capital investment of nearly NZ$5 billion since 1987 was not paid by the taxpayers. In addition, Telecom New Zealand paid $463 million in taxes in the last three years. From antiquated technology to a 97 percent digital system rated second in the World Competitiveness Report (an independent Swiss-based organization) for telecom systems, and from being a drain on the taxpayer, our telecommunications system has become a significant force in an expanding economy that  actually contributes to government revenue through taxation.
<P>
	The Coal Corporation had had losses in 20 of the previous 22 years. In its first year of   corporatization, it increased its level of production while cutting staff numbers in half. And it made a profit. Now while there are fewer workers, they are better paid -- and they have a  future.
<P>
	Since 1987 21 former State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) have been sold, generating NZ$12.8 billion, which has been used to repay debt. Some SOEs remain, some possibly to be privatized (for example, Forestcorp). Others may not (for example, Airways Corp, responsible for air safety, with a profit of NZ$6 million last year, or the New Zealand Post, with very large profits, improved services, and a basic postage stamp rate that has not increased in many years).
<P>

<b>Public Sector Reform</b><P>
	One statistic that gives an idea of the scale of change in the public sector is that it decreased in size from 88,000 people employed in public service in 1984 to 36,000 ten years later:  a reduction of 59 percent.
<P>
	How did we do it?  We made managers fully accountable. For example, permanent heads became CEOs on five-year contracts. They contracted with Ministers to provide certain   outputs. We freed up central controls on finance and personnel policies. We let managers set pay and conditions and use capital to the best advantage. Departments can buy and sell assets within their existing level of appropriation without any further appropriation or authority.
<P>
	We introduced accrual accounting (it was a bit of a shock to find the government's net worth in FY 1992/93 was negative NZ$7.7 billion). We are the only Western government to produce its national accounts in this way, which gives a clear idea of the unfunded liabilities of the government. A capital charge on each department's capital has meant departments no longer regard capital as a free good and leads to much more sensible use of assets, akin to the way a private company would behave.
<P>
	In sum, three key aspects of the government reforms have been very successful:
<p><ol><li>Transparency in the activities and processes of the government;
<li>The liberation of managers from central input controls;
<li>The new financial management and accounting systems.
<P>
<b>LOCKING IN THE REFORMS</b><P>
	The reform process took place under two different governments in New Zealand. From 1984-1990, there was a Labor government; from 1990 onwards, a National government. The National government took up the reform process from Labor and reformed the Labor market. The Employment Contracts Act provided for comprehensive deregulation, employees not being required to join any union, and few external legal constraints other than contract law and minimum standards. National also reformed the welfare system. It reduced the value of government benefits and targeted them more precisely, including means testing to ensure assistance was directed to those most in need.
<P>
	Both parties took steps to ensure that in the future, economic management would be as divorced from politics as possible.
<p>
	The Reserve Bank Act 1989 enhanced the independence of the Reserve Bank and stipulated that the bank's main function, for which the Governor would be held personally responsible, was maintenance of price stability within 0-2 percent.
<P>
	The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1994 requires all of the government's financial reporting to be in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice. The government is required to set medium term objectives, which at present are reducing net debt to between 20 percent-30 percent of GDP, restoring the government's net worth to positive levels, reducing government expenditure to below 30 percent of GDP, not increasing the rate of income tax, and prudently managing risks facing the government. Under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, the government must publish a comprehensive set of accounts annually and before any election.
<P>
<b>RESULTS OF TEN YEARS OF REFORM</b><P>
	In 1994 New Zealand was ranked ninth overall amongst the OECD in the World Competitiveness Report. It ranked first in the world for government policy designed to develop a competitive business environment.
<P>
	After years of low to mediocre growth, New Zealand's economy has grown over the last two years by 5 percent, with growth at times exceeding 6 percent. We believe this is on a sustainable basis. Our mid-term expectation is for between 3.5 percent and 5 percent growth. Inflation has been held below 2 percent -- the second-lowest rate in the OECD.
<P>
	For two years running, the government has balanced its budget. In 1984 the deficit was 9 percent of GDP. This year we expect the surplus will be over 4 percent of GDP (NZ$2.6  billion), rising to 7.5 percent by 1997. Public debt as a share of GDP was nearly 52 percent of GDP at 30 June 1992, is currently 38 percent, and is projected to be down to 18 percent by 1998. Net foreign currency debt will be totally paid off by 30 June 1997.
<P>
	Government spending as a percentage of GDP -- 41 percent in 1991 -- is 34 percent this year, and we aim to have it below 30 percent. Despite this reduction in government spending as a percentage of GDP, expenditure on education overall has been increasing steadily. It was the top expenditure priority in the budget just recently announced. It is now over 5 percent of GDP, above that in the U.K., Australia, and the United States.
<P>
	When accrual accounting was introduced, we discovered the government's net worth in 1992/93 was negative $7.7 billion. By next financial year we expect it to be positive. Unemployment has fallen from a high of 10.9 percent to 6.6 percent, with excellent employment growth in last two years.
<P>
	But even more than these economic statistics, the process of reform, which has not been without pain for many New Zealanders, has now led to a new spirit of self-confidence in the country and a feeling that New Zealand has positioned itself to compete in the global environment. We are now free traders par excellence. We have the cleanest and most comprehensive free trade area in the world, with Australia. We are talking to Chileans. We are exploring a link between the Australia/New Zealand Free Trade Area and ASEAN. We would be delighted to talk free trade with any other economies in the Asia/Pacific region.
<P>
	I hope you will all come down to New Zealand to see for yourselves. New Zealand is not just a pretty place to visit, but also a very stimulating environment. Whilst we do not pretend that there are necessarily any lessons from what has happened in New Zealand for other countries, we are always happy to share experiences with our friends. Come down and see us defend the America's Cup!

<h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.htm">Lectures and Seminars</a></h2><p><hr><p>
<h2><center>
NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIA-U.S. RELATIONS</h2></center><p>
Delivered May 24, 1995 by Shri Pranab Mukherjee, Minister of External Affairs of India
<p>
	Ladies and Gentlemen, I am aware of the importance of The Heritage Foundation in shaping ideas and attitudes in this great country. At a time when our own dialogue with the United States has begun to broaden and deepen, I knew that if I could take the message of the great changes that are occurring in India to the Foundation I could be sure of it reaching those in this country who are interested in knowing about India. My message is about the modernization and reforms that are sweeping throughout our country and the groundwork that is being laid for building strong relations with the outside world, especially with the United States of America.
<P>
<B>Shared Values: Democracy<p></B>
	The people of India and the U.S. are alike in the most fundamental of ways. We are democracies, ruled by the will of the people. The United States is one of the oldest democracies in the world and India the largest. In India, we are particularly proud that our system successfully allows us to mediate the sometimes conflicting interests of our 870 million people. We have repeatedly demonstrated the resilience of our democratic process. We have experienced peaceful and orderly transition of governments and have maintained effective unity in diversity. We face the future with the confidence that our democratic system will be equal to all the challenges it may have to face. If we in India have adjusted better than have many other countries to radical transformation, one of the reasons is that our democratic institutions ensured that the market system and free enterprise flourished even when a strong public sector ruled the commanding heights of our economy.
<p>
<b>Economic Reforms</B><P>
	India's reforms have been aimed at invigorating our economy by liberalization and industrialization, which have had the effect of enhancing competition. The role of the public sector in our economy has been reduced by design, and more stringent accountability has been instituted. Though I am also the Planning Minister, let me confide that the balance between central planning and market-driven investment in our economy is shifting markedly towards the latter. Barriers to foreign participation in India's economy have disappeared in a large number of cases. We realize that our future growth and prosperity can be accomplished best by integrating with the global economy and that if we are to become a global player, our products have to measure up to global standards.
<P>
	The results of these reforms are impressive. Last year the economy grew by 5.3 percent. According to our projection, a similar target will be achieved next year, but I find that a U.S. group of experts has a more optimistic expectation and anticipates that the figure for next year may be 6.3 or 6.4 percent. Industrial growth was almost 9 percent. Foreign exchange reserves have gone up from $1 billion in July 1991 to $21 billion today. Food reserves are at a record high of 30 million tons. Our exports are growing at the rate of about 20 percent in  dollar terms. Inflation has declined sharply in the last few months. Investment offers, direct or indirect, which were under $200 million until only three years ago, are of the order of $4 to $5 billion in the past two years. All in all, the Indian economy is today poised for a sustained growth of 6 to 6.5 percent between now and the year 2000.
<P>
	In implementing our reforms, we have attempted to maintain a political consensus behind them in the country, avoid shock therapy and overheating, and deliberately and carefully sequence the reform process so as to minimize social pain and develop stable markets. We certainly intend to stay the course we have set for ourselves.
<P>
	Our approach has undoubtedly succeeded so far, as borne out by the enthusiastic response received from foreign investors, in particular those from this country. The United States has now become our largest source of foreign investment, with almost 40 percent of approved new investment originating from the U.S. The enlargement of our economic ties is dramatically illustrated by the fact that, in 1993 alone, U.S. firms invested more in India than in the previous 45 years of our relationship. The U.S. is also now our number one trading partner, with an estimated $7.6 billion in goods and services exchanged in 1994. It accounts for 18 percent of our exports and 20 percent of our imports.
<P>
	We are encouraged by the identification of India by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown as "one of the ten most exciting emerging markets in the world."  During Secretary Brown's recent visit to India, business deals of around $7.7 billion were signed. This, plus the $10 million business tie-ups in the energy sector firmed up during Secretary O'Leary's two visits, underscores the enormous opportunities for business and investment in India for U.S. companies.
<P>

<b>Multilateralism in World Trade</b><P>
	In the more economically integrated world ahead of us, it is important that all countries, in particular major trading countries like the U.S., act to strengthen the multilateral trading system. The Uruguay Round has given us an effective framework in the World Trade Organization. On our part we intend to abide fully by the obligations assumed by us as part of the multilateral agreements adopted in Marrakesh. A strong multilateral framework, such as we have established in the WTO, is our best guarantee for continued growth of world trade and prosperity. As we liberalize and reform the Indian economy, this is of vital concern to us. While we can sympathize with the impulses that animate America in controlling what it regards as restrictive trading practices, we do not believe that unilateral measures are the answer. The last thing we wish to see is a trade war between major trading nations, as that is bound to affect our interests adversely.
<P>

<B>Indian Americans</b><P>
	There are around 800,000 people from India in this country, according to the U.S. 1990 census, who have made the U.S. their home. These Indian Americans have made a signal contribution to American society. They have also demonstrated how the values they brought with them from India -- the ideals of family and education, for example -- can help overcome almost any barrier in this land of opportunity. We take pride in the fact that this community has done so well. They form a vested interest in good relations between the U.S. and India. At one stage, we used to fret about the "brain drain" which brought tens of thousands of highly skilled young persons from our country to the U.S.A. and other Western countries. We may still feel the loss in some respects, but we are now able to regard Indians abroad as a resource for the mother country, creating goodwill for India, providing a bridge between the two countries and a source of expertise and capital for the development of India.
<P>

<B>Terrorism</B><P>
	The end of the Cold War has considerably eased the global security situation. But not all regions of the world have benefitted from reduction of tensions. The end of the Cold War has spawned new threats and dangers to the stability of individual states. Ethnic conflicts have sharpened and international terrorism become more widespread. The Oklahoma bombing has brought home dramatically to the American people the human tragedy that is caused by mindless terrorist violence. What you have suffered at Oklahoma City and earlier at the World Trade Center, we in India have suffered in much more virulent form for over a decade in both Punjab and Kashmir. The Bombay blast in March 1993 constituted the biggest single act of urban terrorism in history, causing over 300 deaths and injuries to over 1,000 people. Just a few days ago in Kashmir, the terrorist organizations, the Harkat ul Ansar and Hizbul Mujahideen, burnt down a four and a half century-old religious shrine on the day of the holy Muslim festival of Id-ul-Zuha in a cynical bid to stoke religious fires. The international community needs to join hands to combat the mounting menace of international terrorism and break its close linkage with the narcotics trade. We find it particularly reprehensible that terrorist organizations should be used to subvert legitimately appointed governments and to promote territorial claims on behalf of their sponsors.
<P>

<B>South Asia</b><P>
	We are strongly committed to setting up a structure of durable peace in the subcontinent. There are many problems in our region, but we seek to address them through dialogue and peaceful means. Ultimately, peace is the best guarantee for the security of any country. Global and regional peace and stability provide the best bulwark for a nation's defense. With Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Maldives, India enjoys good friendly and cordial relations. We are constructively engaged in steps to improve our relations with China and have made significant progress in recent times. Unfortunately, with Pakistan we continue to have serious difficulties. Despite our best efforts to engage Pakistan in a serious bilateral dialogue to find solutions to all outstanding issues between us, we have failed to persuade them so far. The 1972 Simla Agreement provides a mutually agreed framework to settle our differences, but Pakistan regrettably has rejected all our calls for a dialogue without preconditions, with or without agenda, at any place of their choice, whether in India or Pakistan.
<P>
	The SAARC Summit earlier this month provided a useful opportunity for Prime Minister Rao and President Leghari of Pakistan to have an exchange of views. We hope that Pakistan will see reason and accept the fundamental proposition that, as two neighbors, we have a lot to gain if we are friends and a lot to lose if we do not make a serious search for realistic solutions to our problems. We may not be able to solve all our problems at one go, but dialogue will permit us to make a start. Let me add that we have no plan or intention to stoke tensions in the region or in any way to threaten regional peace.
<P>

<B>Non-Proliferation</b><P>
	India has faced four major aggressions across our borders since independence. Nuclear weapons and missiles are all around us. Our defense needs are large, but our means to fulfil them are limited. We feel accordingly that our security is best met through progressive global measures for disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  In 1954 we took the lead by introducing a resolution in the United Nations for a complete halt to nuclear testing. In the early 1980s, along with other countries, India had proposed a global convention to cut off all production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. These proposals figured again in the 1988 Action Plan on Nuclear Disarmament proposed by the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi at the third Special Session on Disarmament, which still merits attention as a well thought out and practical program for universal disarmament.
<P>
	The end of the Cold War has created conditions for implementing these proposals. India and the United States are actively cooperating in the U.N. towards this objective. But these are only intermediate steps. Our goal should be to deal with nuclear weapons in the same way as the international community has dealt with the questions of chemical weapons and biological weapons. Our Prime Minister and President Clinton have jointly endorsed the objectives of eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons.
<P>
	India has always adopted a cautious and measured approach in building up its own defense capabilities. Our current expenditures, at around 2.5 percent of the GNP, are far less than those of our neighbors. We have no aggressive aims against others. We covet no nation's territory. We would have preferred to devote all our energies towards economic development. However, our experience of facing repeated aggression has shown that an adequate defense capacity is unavoidable. For all this, however, let me say that the talk one hears, especially in the West, about a nuclear showdown in South Asia is rather farfetched, if not altogether fanciful.
<P>

<B>Conclusion</b><p>
	I hope I have been able to convey a sense of the many things that we share with you. Let me conclude by reiterating what our Prime Minister said last year, in his address to the U.S. Congress:  "Indo-U.S. relations are on the threshold of a bold new era."  The pace at which Indo-U.S. relations have developed and expanded in the past year demonstrates that we have already entered that era. I have no doubt that the new Indo-U.S. partnership we are forging will go from strength to strength.

<P>


       The Agreed Framework signed by the United States and communist 
North Korea last October aims to freeze and ultimately dismantle the 
Pyongyang regime's menacing nuclear weapons development program.  The 
Clinton Administration concedes that North Korea already may have 
constructed one or two nuclear weapons. A North Korean nuclear weapons 
program violates two major international agreements: the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which Pyongyang signed in 1985, and the 
Non-Nuclear Declaration inked with Seoul in 1992.  America's ally, 
South Korea, has complied faithfully with both agreements.
<P>
       Over the six months since the Framework was signed in Geneva in 
late October, the North on several occasions has acted in ways that 
call into question its commitment to the agreement and to easing 
tensions both with the U.S. and with South Korea. On December 17, 
1994, the North downed a U.S. helicopter that strayed into its 
territory, killing one U.S. serviceman and detaining another on false 
charges of espionage.  Fuel oil given to the North by the U.S. in 
February was diverted for military purposes in violation of the Geneva 
agreement.  On April 20, U.S.-North Korean talks broke down after 
Pyongyang refused to accept commitments it had made earlier to allow 
South Korean participation in implementing the Agreed Framework.
<P>
       Still, the North has lived up to its promise to "freeze" its 
nuclear program.  Thus, for now, the Administration's efforts deserve 
support and encouragement.  Further negotiations will confirm whether 
Pyongyang is willing to abide by the full scope of its obligations 
under the Geneva accord.  
<P>
A Generous Package for the North
<P>
       The U.S.-North Korea deal created the Korean Peninsula Economic 
Development Organization (KEDO), a consortium of nations led primarily 
by the U.S., South Korea, and Japan.  KEDO is responsible for 
constructing two light water reactors for the North that would be less 
capable of producing weapons-grade fuel than Pyongyang's existing 
technology.  The construction project's price tag is estimated 
conservatively at about $4.5 billion, with South Korea playing the 
"central" role in financing the project and Japan promising to make a 
"significant" contribution.  It generally is expected that Seoul will 
pay about half of this bill.
<P>
       The same consortium will assist North Korea's faltering economy 
by providing very large quantities of fuel oil. Moreover, Washington 
is easing its long-standing trade embargo on North Korea and will 
advance toward diplomatic relations with the North. The first step 
would be the exchange of "liaison offices." Japan also has resumed 
normalization talks with Pyongyang.
<P>
       In return, the North has agreed to "freeze" its nuclear program 
and to allow limited scrutiny by the United Nations' International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This prevents the North from taking 
additional steps to reprocess spent reactor fuel for bomb-making 
purposes. The North also has pledged to move its large cache of spent 
fuel rods out of the country and to permit the IAEA finally to perform 
"special inspections." These inspections would give the U.N. body a 
reliable estimate of the North's bomb-making capabilities. However, 
these pledges would not be fulfilled until delivery of key nuclear 
components to North Korea for completion of its first reactor. This 
could take five years.
<P>
        In the final stage of the deal, once both reactors have been 
completed, the North promises to dismantle all of its nuclear 
facilities that exist today. According to Clinton Administration 
estimates, this dismantling will not begin for at least ten years.
<P>
Pyongyang's Drive to Isolate Seoul
<P>
       Under the Geneva agreement, the U.S. and North Korea pledged to 
"make best efforts" to conclude negotiations on a reactor supply 
contract within six months. The contract was to outline the details of 
the massive construction project.  When Washington and Pyongyang 
signed the deal on October 21, 1994, the North's negotiators made a 
verbal commitment to accept South Korean-manufactured reactors. Since 
Seoul will be paying the lion's share of the project's bill, it 
understandably has been tapped by KEDO as the central player in the 
project.  Seoul expects to act as the prime contractor in the reactor 
construction.
<P>
       However, talks between the U.S. and the North in Berlin broke 
down on April 20, one day before the contract target date. Pyongyang 
reneged on its earlier commitment to accept South Korean reactors.  It 
also opposed Seoul's central role in KEDO.  Senior Republic of Korea 
government officials have made it clear that, if the North refuses 
Seoul's active involvement in the project, the South will not provide 
financial backing.  Since no other nation will come up woth several 
billion dollars in Seoul's stead, the project cannot proceed without 
South Korean participation.
<P>
       In response, the Clinton Administration has proposed that the 
U.S. and North Korea resume high-level political talks in Geneva in 
hopes of reaching an agreement on the important reactor project supply 
contract. This is a prudent signal to the North and the international 
community that Washington remains open to dialogue.  Still, the 
Administration should draw the line at offering any compromise on the 
key issue of South Korean participation. Clearly, Pyongyang seeks to 
isolate Seoul and strengthen its bilateral relations with the U.S.  
South Koreans have expressed their concern that the North has gained 
politically in its dealings with Washington while Seoul appears at 
times to be marginalized.  Seoul has no official place at the Agreed 
Framework bargaining table.
<P>
Policy Options for the Future
<P>
       Recent talks over the reactor supply contract represent an 
important milestone in the implementation of the Agreed Framework.  
The North's willingness to fulfill all of its commitments under the 
deal should be tested early on.  Pyongyang should be pressed to accept 
the requirements regarding South Korea's reactors and Seoul's central 
role in KEDO.  The U.S. must be prepared to stand firm and avoid 
further concessions to the North.  To its credit, the Clinton 
Administration did this in a united front with Seoul during the April 
Berlin talks when it resisted the North's demands.  This was a wise 
and prudent use of the leverage the U.S. now has with Pyongyang, for 
the North stands to reap generous political and economic benefits from 
the agreement. Looking to the future, a consistently strong show of 
American determination is in order.  Past experience indicates that 
the North will behave responsibly only to the extent that Washington 
follows a firm, steady course.
<P>
       If implementation of the framework is hampered by stalemated 
talks with Pyongyang, the U.S. should maintain a strong and principled 
posture until the North drops its unreasonable positions.  Progress 
toward the exchange of liaison offices should be slowed, as should the 
movement toward North Korea-Japan normalization that began in March.  
Similarly, trade benefits under the agreements should be curtailed.  
These actions will be painful for Pyongyang in view of its 
deteriorating economy and diplomatic isolation.  
<P>
       It is also important that the U.S. press the North to resume 
talks with Seoul. The nuclear program is but one threat to peace on 
the Korean Peninsula.  A high state of tension exists between the 
North and South.  Pyongyang maintains a massive military force, which 
includes chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles. The 
hostile North Korean regime threatens stability in Northeast Asia, and 
the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea are in harm's way.  
American vital interests would be served by reducing inter-Korean 
tension. The Agreed Framework includes a commitment by Pyongyang to 
resume productive dialogue with Seoul, but it has refused to do so.  
The U.S., in close consultation with Seoul, must press Pyongyang to 
restart long-stalled North-South talks.  Ultimately, the path to 
Korean peace and reunification runs not between the U.S. and North 
Korea, but between Seoul and Pyongyang. 
<P>
U.S. Policy for the "Worst Case"
<P>
       The "worst case" scenario is one in which the North breaches 
the agreement by restarting its reactor or resuming fuel reprocessing.  
In this event, the Clinton Administration has made it clear that the 
Framework would be pronounced null and void by Washington. Steps then 
should be taken by the U.S., but not steps that would fuel a crisis 
atmosphere.  The North often has operated skillfully in the midst of  
crises, issuing war threats and pressing Washington to make 
concessions in order to break an impasse.  One mistake American policy 
makers have made in the past has been to stress that the choice is 
between an agreement or war.  Unless unnecessarily provoked, it is 
improbable that Pyongyang would embark on a war that eventually would 
end in its defeat and demise.  The combined U.S.-ROK military 
partnership has deterred the North since the end of the Korean War.  
This deterrence will continue to function whether or not the North has 
an active nuclear weapons program.
<P>
       Additional steps that should be taken in the event of a breach 
of the nuclear freeze include:
<P>
*  A U.N. vote of condemnation.  The international community can 
pressure the North through a strong show of displeasure and concern 
over the North's actions.
<P>
*  Economic pressure on the North though a U.S.-led multilateral 
coalition.  Pressing for U.N. sanctions against North Korea would not 
be productive. A sanctions bid would be a slow, tedious process that 
may be blocked in the Security Council by the North's ally, China. 
Beijing may be more cooperative if the U.S. and its allies avoid high-
profile U.N. action. Only a small number of nations trade with the 
North. Thus, Washington and Seoul should quietly seek the cooperation 
of China, Japan, and Russia in curtailing or ceasing trade and aid to 
the North.
<P>
*  Clear U.S. reaffirmation of its defense commitments to South Korea 
and Japan.  Significant upgrading of the U.S. military presence in the 
ROK in the foreseeable future is not necessary.  The current combined 
readiness is adequate.  Any provocative movements by the North should 
be answered, however, by appropriate U.S. counteractions.
<P>
       A breach of the North's freeze would be a setback, but one that 
would show that Pyongyang never intended to fulfill its obligations 
under the agreement in the first place.  Tension on the peninsula will 
continue, but war is not the inevitable outcome.  Instead, together 
with Seoul, the U.S. should make it clear that it will deter, contain, 
and isolate the North -- as it has for more than four decades. Only an 
end to its extreme international isolation, combined with the 
institution of domestic reforms, can protect the Pyongyang regime from 
eventual collapse.  Time is on the side of Seoul and Washington, and 
Washington must not lose sight of this fact.

F.Y.I No. 92<br>
March 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Office of Management and Budget last week announced that the FY 1996 deficit is forecast to be $145.6 billion, or one-half of the FY 1992 level of $290.4 billion.<sup>1</sup>  Although the Clinton Administration claims credit for this significant deficit reduction, in fact it has had very little to do with it.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Before President Clinton took office, three factors already were beginning to bring down the deficit:
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>1) Reductions in defense spending. </b> A significant part of the decrease in the deficit is the result of much lower defense spending.  Defense spending in FY 1996 will be $266.3 billion, which is $36.3 billion less than in FY 1992.  In real, inflation-adjusted terms, defense spending is the lowest since the Carter years, and as a percentage of GDP it is lower than before World War II.  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has testified to Congress about the dangerous neglect of military procurement, which is now at the lowest level since the Korean War.  Since FY 1992, military procurement has been reduced by 44 percent.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>2) The reform of deposit insurance.</b>  The most deceptive part of the "deficit reduction" between FY 1992 and FY 1996 is simply the way in which the budget accounts for federal deposit insurance for banks and thrift institutions.  During the Bush Administration, the S&L bailout made the budget deficit much greater, requiring $57.9 billion in FY 1990 and $66.2 billion in FY 1991.  But in FY 1993, before Clinton's economic policies were enacted, the federal government actually began to make a profit of $28 billion from selling assets.  In FY 1996, the deposit insurance funds will bring in $13.5 billion to make the deficit appear even smaller.  The Clinton Administration has enjoyed a large windfall.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Defense spending cuts and the distorting effects of deposit insurance account for 36 percent of the change in the deficit between FY 1992 and FY 1996.  While the Administration claims credit for deficit reduction, its domestic spending has surged 23 percent since FY 1992, from $857.1 billion in FY 1992 to $1,058.4 billion in FY 1996.  Domestic spending now is equal to 14.5 percent of GDP, the highest proportion since the 1980 and 1982 recessions, which pushed up the ratio because the economy slumped.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>3) Economic growth and tax revenues.</b>  As the economy grew out of the 1990-1991 recession, federal tax revenues began to increase significantly.  Indeed, one of the largest contributing factors in the huge deficits during the Bush years was the drop in revenue growth during the recession.  Historically, tax revenues have grown at about 7.9 percent per year, but during 1990-1992, government revenues grew at half that rate.  When the economy recovered from the Bush recession in FY 1993, revenue growth rebounded strongly to 9 percent, and FY 1994 saw a 7.8 percent growth.  Government revenues have grown from $1,090.5 billion to $1,426.8 billion, or 31 percent, since FY 1992.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This significant growth in taxes, combined with the cut in defense spending and the shift of deposit insurance from a net cost to a profit center in the budget, accounts for all of Clinton's deficit reduction.  Not a dime of this deficit reduction is from controlling spending.  The "era of big government" is not over; it is just hiding behind the business cycle and post-Cold War defense policy.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Just as incoming Presidents are unfairly blamed for economic slowdowns, they also receive unwarranted credit for economic growth even when it is more sluggish than it should be.  A look at what has happened to federal tax revenues collected since the first Clinton budget suggests that the deficit should have been falling faster.  The Clinton Administration's 1993 tax increase has been followed by a significant slowdown in the rate of growth in tax revenues.  In FY 1996, federal revenue is projected to be only $71.6 billion greater than it was in FY 1995, while in FY 1995 it was $97.5 billion higher than FY 1994, and in FY 1994 it was $104.2 billion greater than in FY 1993.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to the Congressional Budget Office, tax revenues from the Clinton 1993 tax hike increased from $26.4 billion to $51.5 billion between FY 1994 and FY 1996.<sup>2</sup>  But the total increase in tax revenues from all sources decreased from $104.2 billion to $71.6 billion.  Most of the drop in the deficit from new revenues occurred before the new 1993 tax increases could be collected. The tax data suggest that Clinton's economic policies actually may have sapped the economic recovery and produced a deficit larger than it otherwise could have been.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
CBO's September 1993 estimate of new tax revenues from Clinton's economic program might have been too large, but such an error would hardly be to the credit of the political leadership that pushed through the largest tax increase in history on a strictly party-line vote.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Heritage Foundation will soon release a report analyzing the impact of the Clinton Administration's tax and spending policies from the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93) on the nation's economic performance.  Using one of the nation's leading models of the U.S. economy, this study will examine how the economy would be performing today had the Clinton Administration and Congress not raised taxes as the U.S. was coming out of the 1990-1991 recession.  This analysis will show that President Clinton's 1993 economic plan actually has deprived Americans of a higher standard of living by cutting the economy's growth potential.

<p>
Since the publication of "A Nation at Risk" in 1983, Americans have become increasingly alarmed about the dismal results and soaring costs of their public schools. No group of citizens has a closer view of these problems or a more immediate stake in addressing them than the parents of the country's 48 million schoolchildren. Here and there, parents have won minor battles to influence curricula or oust mediocre school-board members. But as individuals, parents are no match for the forces that favor the status quo.<p>
Parents' most promising forum to agitate for reform and hold their local educators accountable for failure already exists: the venerated National Congress of Parents and Teachers, commonly known as the PTA. Unfortunately, parents cannot count on either their local PTA or its national leadership to advance parental interests—or even air diverse viewpoints. As it operates today, the PTA is useless to parents who want to play a meaningful role in educational reform. <p>
The mission of the PTA has always been to "work on behalf of the best interests of all children on issues that affect their health, education, and welfare" and "to encourage parent involvement." With almost seven million members, the PTA offers great potential for promoting parental involvement in the educational welfare of children. But in the 1990s, that mission requires of the PTA something it has been unwilling to do: demand accountability for performance and spending at every level of the educational system.<p><center><b>Local Control</center></b><p>
Decades ago, parents had significant influence over their neighborhood schools. Over the years, however, school districts consolidated, teachers and administrators came to see themselves as credentialed professionals, and state laws standardized educational practices and curricula. Today, many parents are less likely to get involved in their children's educational environment. Nevertheless, the impetus for reform will have to come from parents active at the grass roots.<p>
The PTA ought to be helping such parents overcome the considerable barriers to holding local educators accountable. For instance, it should be of great concern to parents that student grades tend to be as high in low-achieving as in high-achieving schools, but the PTA deliberately avoids such educational issues.<p>
In the annual battles over allocating financial resources, the PTA should play a major role in deciphering complicated budgets for the benefit of interested parents. Instead, PTAs rally with teachers unions for tax increases, seldom questioning the effect on parents or the educational outcomes for students.<p>
Parents also deserve greater consideration of their  interests in the contract negotiations that determine pay and working conditions for teachers. For instance, teachers in Montgomery County, Maryland, refused to write recommendations for their college-bound students because such "extra" duties weren't in their contract. In some areas, a parent who wishes to lodge a complaint about a teacher must navigate a bureaucratic process established by contract. Parents may have to submit a written account of the grievance in order to secure a meeting with the teacher, who has the right to bring along a union representative. Some parents find such time-consuming and intimidating conditions a clear subordination of parental interests to teacher rights.<p>
It is indisputable that teachers are already well represented in negotiations. Therefore, an effective local PTA that works on behalf of parental interests should insist on more than the current minimal accord paid to parental concerns. Working through the PTA, parents could ensure that their schools:
<ul><li>Demand pro-parent scrutiny of teacher contracts;<li>Justify their annual budgets;<li>Air alternative views to the pro-union positions on privatization, teacher tenure, tuition-tax credits, school choice, and teacher standards;<li>Establish expeditious complaint procedures so that parents could challenge decisions and actions of teachers or administrators;<li>Make certain that student grades provide parents with adequate information about the educational progress of their children, or lack of it.</UL>	
<p>
Nowadays, local matters are greatly affected by policy at higher levels. State governments now have a hand in everything from funding to curricular standards. President Clinton's Goals 2000 legislation, enacted last year and under review by the new Republican-controlled Congress, may bring down the heavy hand of the federal government, too (see sidebar, page 88). Similarly, PTA members who wish to be active at the local level must take account of PTA policies set by the state and national hierarchies and imposed on individual chapters.<p>
At the least, the PTA has the power to keep parents informed of academic issues, from educational policies set at the national and state levels to the curriculum and employment practices of their local schools. At its best, the PTA could help frame the national debate over educational reform, lobby for some of the reforms that debate has already produced, and work to change the restrictive collective-bargaining statutes that tend to shield teacher unions and teachers from accountability and limit parental involvement.<p>Why the PTA Is Weak
<ul><li>PTA's ineffectiveness can be attributed to six inter-related areas:<li>Misdirected resources. At the local level, the PTA has become a fundraising auxiliary for school districts, while its child-advocacy efforts have focused on social, non-educational issues.<li>Stifled debate. Many PTA officials stifle open discussion of controversial issues and discourage parents from questioning the PTA's official positions.<li>Ignorance. Most PTA members have no idea of the policies advocated in their name by the PTA hierarchy at the national and state levels.<li>Careerism. The PTA's national officers are elected by a restrictive process that requires a national PTA presidential candidate to make a commitment of nearly 10 years to rise "through the chairs." Consequently, many PTA national leaders serve long after their own children have left school.<li>Transient membership. Parental interest is often high at the elementary-school level, tapers off in middle school, and all but disappears in high school. As a result, PTA officers and professional staff have inordinate influence.<li>Teachers-union influence. National PTA policies, which often are automatically adopted as state and local PTA policies, reflect the dominant influence of the teachers unions, especially the National Education Association (NEA). </ul>
<p>
Of these factors, by far the most important is the last. Parents and teachers in the PTA both claim to share the same goal: promoting the educational welfare of children. But the PTA's governance structure, in which unionized teachers play a major role, is fatally flawed. Fundamentally, parents and their children are the consumers of education; teachers are part of the producer complex. Elevating the interests of the producers above the interests of the consumers is a formula for irrelevance. In the last 12 months, I have attended two national PTA meetings and five state conventions, and I cannot recall a single instance in which any policy contrary to the interests of teachers unions was given a proper hearing.<p>
Ever since the 1960s, the NEA and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) have lobbied vigorously for state legislation requiring school boards to bargain collectively with teachers unions over the terms and conditions of employment. Teachers have the statutory right to bargain collectively in 34 states and the District of Columbia. Many school districts outside of those states engage in de facto collective bargaining with the teachers unions. By its refusal to challenge the teachers unions in collective bargaining, the PTA has eliminated itself as an independent advocate for parents. The PTA claims to "seek to participate in the decisionmaking process establishing school policy." But whenever school boards sacrifice parental interests to union interests as often happens in these negotiations, the PTA cannot and will not object.<p>
Such impotence has been apparent at least since the PTA's 1968 position statement on "teacher negotiations, sanctions, and strikes." The PTA resolution, reaffirmed in 1987, identifies the "dilemmas" that teacher militancy and union negotiations impose on PTA members:<ul>
<p>
"1. If the PTA provides volunteers to man the classrooms, during a work stoppage, in the interest of protecting the immediate safety and welfare of children, it is branded as a strike breaker.<p>
"2. If the PTA does not take sides in issue[s] being negotiated, it is accused of not being interested.<p>
"3. If it supports the positions of the board of education, which is the representative of the public in negotiations, the teacher members of the PTA have threatened to withdraw membership and boycott the local PTA activities." (Italics added.)</ul>
<p>
Collective bargaining is used in most school districts to resolve such issues as teacher compensation for extra curricular activities, class size, parental grievance procedures, and the frequency and scheduling of parent/teacher conferences. In effect, the PTA does not take sides on issues subject to bargaining, regardless of their impact on students, parents, or the public. That position constitutes a major victory for unions and a setback for parents.<p>
How are PTA members supposed to respond to this dilemma? The 1968 resolution urges them to be alert to symptoms of teacher dissatisfaction (abnormal turnover, complaints, and "teacher-supported legislation defeated by state legislature") before a strike and to promote the public airing of issues. At no point does the PTA suggest that teacher dissatisfaction may be unwarranted. The PTA's statement acknowledges that the teachers' threat to withdraw membership and boycott the organization greatly concerns the scores of PTA's professional staff members at the state and national organizations.<p>
This surrender may have the cost the organization anyway. The PTA does not keep track of the ratio of teachers to parents among its membership. But we do know that membership peaked in 1966, when more than 12 million teachers, administrators, and parents were members of the National PTA.<p>
The organization then lost more than six million members from 1966 to 1982, years when collective bargaining by teachers unions increased to unprecedented levels. With the withdrawal of parent activists who refused to accept the PTA's subservience to union interests, the PTA has evolved into an NEA front on non-educational as well as educational issues.<p>
To be sure, the PTA sponsors many worthwhile programs and activities. Few of them, however, relate to education. The PTA doesn't merely waste its potential for constructive action; it may even hinder reform. In recent years, the teachers' unions' formidable influence over the PTA has been seen in the following issues:<p>
Opposition to school choice. In addition to its refusal to challenge union positions in collective bargaining and teacher strikes, the PTA opposes vouchers and tuition-tax credits that would empower parents to choose private schools. Thus the PTA has capitulated to the NEA/AFT insistence on maintaining the public-school monopoly at all costs.<p>
Delegates to the 1994 state convention of the California Congress of Parents, Teachers, and Students (the California PTA) broke into thunderous applause when a speaker congratulated them on defeating the school-choice ballot initiative known as Proposition 174. "You were the voice of the California children!" she shouted. More than one million California PTA volunteers defeated Proposition 174, she said, and "all the California Teachers Association did was put up the money." <p>
In fact, the PTA provided a large bloc of foot soldiers in the campaign against Proposition 174. At one workshop, a PTA official reminded delegates that "we will pull the PTA Charter if any unit goes beyond the PTA agenda—as we would have with any PTA that supported vouchers."<p>
No matter how modest a voucher plan might be, the PTA can be expected to oppose it. In 1994, New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman was expected to introduce a pilot program for school vouchers in the ailing Jersey City school system. Nevertheless, state and national PTA officials called the plan a "threat" to public education. As a result, New Jersey PTA delegates voted to "[t]ake an active role in opposing" private-school vouchers. Not surprisingly, the PTA and the New Jersey affiliate of the NEA joined a coalition to defeat this and all other voucher proposals. <p>
Opposition to privatization. State PTAs structure their conventions to reinforce the national organization's opposition to privatization of school services. At Maryland's state PTA convention last year, the state vice president for legislative activity expressed hostility for privatization. Several delegates stomped out of a standing-room-only session on the topic when the state chairwoman refused to permit a balanced discussion of audience views on this issue. She instead rebutted criticism of PTA's opposition to contracting out school services. The reason for PTA opposition? Allegedly, some unionized employees could lose their jobs.<p>
Focus on non-educational issues. PTA programs are designed to diminish dissatisfaction with poor school performance. Instead of conducting hearings to address the causes of academic deficiencies, PTAs sponsor events presenting students' work in the most favorable light. Much time and effort goes into women's auxiliary or support services: trip chaperoning, bake sales, and other fundraising activities. Clearly, good PTA parents are supposed to be passive supporters, not active critics, of schools and teachers. <p>
Last summer, PTA delegates from 53 states and territories met in Las Vegas for the 98th annual national convention. Convention delegates received two days of workshops to learn how to produce materials that generate positive public reaction to PTA, respond to extremist groups challenging health/sex education curricula, implement the PTA's HIV/AIDS awareness programs, and rebut right-wing groups favoring school choice.<p>
Delegates considered resolutions on violence in video games, inhalant abuse, the quality of indoor air in portable classrooms, and the sale, resale, and destruction of confiscated firearms. These are typical of the non-educational, social issues on which PTAs focus their time and money.<p><center><b>The PTA Stifles Dialogue</b></center><p>
In its 1983 position statement in support of public education (revised and reaffirmed in 1991), the national PTA pledged to ensure that "adequate, objective, and language-appropriate information be available to parents so that they can make informed decisions." Unfortunately, the PTA is ignoring this directive.<p>
Given the way PTAs are governed, it is virtually impossible for parent members to develop parent-friendly policies that may conflict with the interests of teachers unions. Parents ought to have a forum for advocating the adoption of reforms like school-choice programs and the privatization of school services, ensuring that teachers are available for frequent conferences with parents, challenging teacher tenure, and assessing the value of report cards, grades, and standardized tests for measuring student performance. Unfortunately, many PTA parents are finding it increasingly difficult to articulate their needs and lodge their complaints within the PTA.<p>
Taking such action within the PTA would require parents to challenge teachers and teachers unions at meetings where both are present. Many parents fear teacher retaliation if they aggressively advocate parental over teacher interests. PTA parents also feel intimidated by the overwhelming pro-union bias in PTA publications and programs, as seen in the selection of convention issues and speakers.<p>
When one speaker after another proclaims the dangers of school choice, for example, it is difficult for rank-and-file members to challenge the PTA's position on the issue. PTA convention programs and publications ought to include balanced discussion of the issues.<p>
Indeed, open discussion of parental concerns is virtually absent at state and national PTA meetings. In practice, parents who seek accurate, unbiased information on educational issues are expected to fall in line with PTA positions.<p>
"The PTA severely limits the opportunity for dialogue and dissent," says Jo Cooper, an Oklahoma parent and 19-year PTA veteran. In 1994, the state legislative chairman of the Oklahoma PTA warned her not to publicly oppose national PTA positions. Cooper's offense? In a public meeting in her suburban Oklahoma City school district, she opposed the national PTA's enthusiastic support of the Goals 2000 legislation and HR 6, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Cooper believes both pieces of federal legislation will undermine local control.<p>
In 1992, Kathy Moran, a PTA official in Villa Park, California, received a letter from the state organization demanding that PTA leaders "do everything possible" to block the gathering of signatures for the 1992 state ballot initiative on school choice. When she tried to organize a debate on the merits of choice, she was told that PTA chapters must present only the anti-choice perspective. <p><center><b>What's a Parent to Do?</center></b>
<p>
Is it any wonder that a backlash is developing? Small groups of concerned and sometimes angry parents are challenging the status quo—including the PTA's deference to the teachers unions. Among their options:<ul>
<li>
Withhold support. Withholding dues to the state and national organizations can be an effective way to protest. At its recent board meeting, the Indiana State PTA lamented that it had to amend its annual budget after losing 3,000 members and their dues.<li>
Reform from within. Parents who believe the PTA can be reformed from within should form a "parental-control" caucus. Parents committed to pro-parent policies could bring about basic changes in the PTA. With a functioning caucus, they might find the strength to make their voices heard at state and national conventions. They could push to reform cumbersome procedures and restrictive election requirements in order to elect national PTA officers committed to pro-parent positions.<p>
Of course, for such internal reform to succeed, more parents now dissatisfied with PTA operations would have to become involved. Like-minded parents need to serve as officers of local chapters and as delegates to state and national conventions.<li>
Assert leadership locally. In Greenwich, Connecticut, local PTA president Kay Wall questioned the state's implementation of a misnamed "outcome-based education" program in June 1992. Without the support of the PTA, she organized a protest group, the Committee to Save Our Schools (SOS), which contributed to the collapse of Connecticut's plan. <p>
Within her local PTA chapter, Wall has organized and chairs an Academic Challenge and Excellence Committee (ACE) that focuses on restoring high academic standards for all children. "They don't really want parents involved in the way I want to be involved," Wall says, "which is knowing the details of the curriculum, knowing what is being tested, and questioning the new standards." Wall is also encouraging members to challenge the PTA's official support of Goals 2000.<li>
Revise PTA membership policy. As long as unionized teachers employed under collective bargaining are members of the PTA, it may be futile for parents to criticize educational policy. The NEA's own experience is instructive here. Before the enactment of collective-bargaining laws, the NEA included administrators at the local, state, and national levels. As a result, local NEA chapters were usually unable to promote teachers' interests, and actions of school administrators were seldom criticized.<li>
Encourage competition. If parents feel that their PTA cannot represent their interests, they should form alternative organizations. Some active parents are requesting disaffiliation from the national PTA. Janice Thompson, a parent in North Carolina who calls herself a "keeper of the home," ardently opposes the PTA's social agenda and its close association with teachers unions. Thompson emphasizes the need for parental involvement in academic issues, and feels that PTA affiliation is a hindrance, not a help, to parents who wish to raise academic standards.<p>
To build her case for reverting back to a local parent-teacher organization (PTO), she called the North Carolina State PTA office in Raleigh and asked, "What is the last thing the PTA accomplished in the classroom?" Says Thompson, "They didn't even have an answer." Last March, parents at her elementary school voted to revert to a PTO. "At the local level," Thompson says, "we know the issues, and here we can work with parents and the school for the benefit of the students." <p>
The PTO is organized locally, with no allegiance to state or national associations. Local parents, teachers, and administrators direct the activities, which are not unlike those of the PTA. Governance is usually through simple bylaws, determined by all parents who attend the meetings. It's true, as PTA literature points out, that a PTO does not emphasize lobbying efforts—but such efforts might contradict local standards and parental positions. Members of PTOs have found they can work through the local education maze more easily without the national-policy prohibitions and teachers union allegiances of the PTA. <p>
Activist PTO parents direct their energy toward improving their own schools and their own children's educational opportunities. While many appreciate a PTO's autonomy, some recognize its lack of organizational training and support.<li>
New opportunities for involvement. Current educational reforms are introducing new ways for parents to become involved in schools. For instance, charter and magnet schools within public-school systems often include provisions for parental involvement similar to requirements at private and parochial schools. School-management companies and for-profit businesses that offer services to public schools often stress active parental involvement. Parents should encourage this trend by insisting that school districts and schools retain the utmost flexibility in contracting for services.</ul>
<p>
At a time when special-interest groups are increasingly viewed in a negative light, the PTA is already well placed to act as a respected advocate for the educational interests of children and parents. As the struggle intensifies, the teachers unions will do their utmost to preserve the PTA as their subservient ally. The good news is that parents concerned about education want to do more than attend monthly PTA meetings. They are forming groups and creating procedures that will empower them as consumers of government services.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">P</FONT></B>arents and politicians tend to blame the education establishment for the sorry 
state of learning in American public schools. The educrats are not taking this lying down. 
They've found their own scapegoat: parents. Public-school boosters have decided that lax 
parental involvement is the reason children fail. And so some have begun turning the 
schools into Big Mother.</P> 
<P>	The newest trend in education "reform" is the inclusion of parental-education 
programs and curricula that require parental involvement in student activities. President 
Clinton's Goals 2000, enacted last year, includes an entire section on "parental 
assistance," also called "parent training." Some schools even require parents to sign a 
pledge that they will perform assigned, pseudo-educational tasks, which could include 
playing "Simon Says" or rolling cookie dough with their third-grader.</P>
<P>	Of course parents should be involved in their children's education. And, of 
course, problems at home--messy divorces, absent fathers--can cause problems for 
children at school. But the "parent education" movement seeks to blame all parents for 
academic failure, not just parents who are neglecting their kids or destroying their own 
families. The movement does not seek to make parents more demanding of their children, 
nor, no surprise, of the schools. To the contrary, new curricula urge parents to be 
nurturing and uncritical--sort of the way public-school officials would like parents to 
treat them.</P>
<P>	This philosophy is becoming institutionalized in California. Consider the math 
curriculum rated most highly--a perfect 100 percent--by a state education panel that 
chooses which textbooks should qualify for state subsidies. "Investigations in Numbers, 
Data and Space," from the Dale Seymour Publications Series, appealed to the panel 
because it included home assignments that require parental involvement.</P>

<H3>New New Math</H3>
<P>	Under this curriculum--call it New New Math--which eschews rigorous 
memorization of multiplication tables, teachers send home periodic "Dear Family" 
missives to third-grade parents with the following advice:</P>
<UL><LI>  "Don't worry if your child doesn't use a ruler accurately yet--it's a skill that will 
develop over time, with more and more opportunities to measure."<BR>
<LI>  "Children have very interesting ways to figure out these problems. You can help by 
asking your child to tell you how he or she got an answer. There are many ways to do 
these problems--and no single `right' way. What's important for your child to know is 
how his or her own way works."<BR>
<LI>  "When your child has an assignment to do at home--such as collecting data about the 
ages of pets and oldest relatives--offer your help, and ask your child about what he or 
she is doing in class."<BR>
<LI>  "There is one thing we ask you not to do. We won't be using some of the step-by-step 
methods of addition and subtraction in this unit that may be familiar to you--nor will we 
be teaching borrowing or carrying. All too often, we have found that children this age 
memorize these step-by-step procedures and do not learn how to apply the processes of 
addition and subtraction. This year we will support students in developing several 
strategies for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing, and we prefer that they do 
not memorize a single set of procedures."</UL>

<H3>Educational Relativism</H3>
<P>	This New New Math adds up to a new way of letting schools off the hook for not 
teaching children. It's not enough that we have moral relativism in English and Social 
Studies. Now we have it in math, too.</P>
<P>	The Dale Seymour third-grade program instructs parents to "make roll-out 
cookies with your child" to explore shapes, include children in family math decisions 
(such as how many floor tiles to buy) and explore "fair shares," which is politically-
correct educratese for "sharing food." Clearly the intent of these instructions is to force 
parents to spend quality time--at least as defined by educrats.</P>
<P>	So what's wrong with that? Supporters argue that parents, especially single 
parents, may not spend enough quality time with their children and would benefit from 
programs that nudge them to do so. But not all parents need this nudge, and some object 
to the schools' sledgehammer approach. And many may object to a pervasive touchy-
feely, there's-no-such-thing-as-a-wrong-answer attitude being foisted upon parents.</P>
<P>	In Petaluma, California, a mandatory high-school course called Human 
Interaction, or HI!, has provoked an angry reaction from some parents.</P> 
<P>	They resent take-home assignments that tell them how to be parents. The 
program's take-home and in-class "teen/parent" worksheets have included these queries 
for ninth-graders:</P>
<UL><LI>  Whether "how much money your parents make" is a private issue or can be discussed in 
class.<BR>
<LI>  Whether any "close relatives" has ever suffered "alcoholism" or "mental illness."<BR>
<LI>  Whether students "feel OK about crying" and "allow" themselves to do so.<BR></UL>
<P>	Other questions explore whether students recycle, eat fast food, use public 
transportation and "accept the way [they] feel about things."</P>
<P>	According to administrators, the course is a hit with kids. You can see why. No 
boring memorization or flexing of the gray cells here. Student assignments encourage 
teens to go with their feelings. "Denying" them, they are told, is passive behavior. A class 
worksheet on "family systems" assures teens that "open" families are "`pure' 
democracy," while "closed" families are "hierarchal."</P>
<P>	Federal law prohibits schools from asking children for highly personal 
information without parents' permission. The district explains that teens are meant to fill 
out the worksheets for their own private use, but at least two teachers in Petaluma told 
students to turn in signed worksheets. And Stephen Collins, the assistant superintendent 
of the Petaluma School District, admitted last fall that, once such worksheets are passed 
out, it is very likely that these topics will be discussed in class.</P>
<P>	Petaluma parents Jay and Tura Avner pulled their two children from HI!. "They 
want to be surrogate parents," Tura Avner complains. She especially resents the district's 
assumption that "unless the schools taught me how to manage my kids, they'd be running 
wild in the streets."</P>
<P>	But the Avners' efforts to liberate their children have not been easy. The district 
would not assign the Avners' son to an alternative, academic class. Instead, he was forced 
to be a counselor's aide for that period. Worse, the district dragged its feet for months 
before granting a "waiver" from this program. So much for "voluntary" parental 
education.</P>
<P>	District administrators sometimes insinuate that dissenters are right-wing religious 
fanatics. These days, that is a standard response to complaints. State law allows parents to 
pull their children from classes for reasons of religious belief or moral conscience. The 
Petaluma district, however, wouldn't let parents remove their children without a fight. 
Last year, the superintendent's cabinet, the district counsel, and HI! officials crafted a 
waiver form requiring parents to list their "reason(s) why they did not want their children 
to attend, and declare that they would provide appropriate alternative educational 
experiences" on HI! topics. This tactic clearly was designed to prompt parents with 
religious objections to proclaim themselves, giving administrators potential grist for the 
anti-fundamentalist mill. Yet California law clearly protects parents' right to keep private 
their reasons for objecting to a class.</P>
<P>	The kicker: Until the Rutherford Institute, a religious-freedom advocacy group, 
threatened a lawsuit, the district proposed that parents sign the waiver forms "under 
penalty of perjury." The penalty for perjury in California is a jail term of up to four years. 
Was the district planning to arrest parents who don't teach their children recycling? "I 
don't know that we were going to do anything," assistant superintendent Collins 
explained at the time. "We knew that when we went into this it was going to be revised."</P>
<P>	Collins was forthcoming in his defense of HI!'s "individual growth, physical 
growth, and social growth" curriculum. It is "pretty generally believed," he said, that 
most parents don't communicate with their children. Then there's the if-schools-don't-
teach-this-children-will-die argument. Collins explained that the board determined that 
HI! "was a matter of life and death." "If students don't have the tools to deal with the 
pressures" and destructive elements in life, he said, the board feared teens "would make 
the wrong choices and it would be fatal."</P>
<P>	This thinking betrays a strong anti-parent bent. Parents, apparently, fail to instill 
their children with self-esteem or AIDS awareness, so the schools must fill the void. 
Educrats have concluded that children who ignore their oafish parents' words on, say, 
safe sex will miraculously heed their teachers. Worse, HI! assumes that teens will build 
more self-esteem by talking about their feelings than by learning to speak a foreign 
language or play a musical instrument.</P>
<P>	Similarly, New New Mathmeisters seem to have a Rousseauesque view that 
children will grasp math intuitively if not distracted by narrow-minded parents or 
teachers. For example, the California math-curriculum panel disapproved of exercises 
that are "generally under the direction of the teacher." That Californian teachers' unions 
have supported this shows how far they have moved from their support of traditional 
pedagogy.</P>

<H3>Why Have Schools?</H3>
<P>	Maureen DiMarco, Governor Pete Wilson's education adviser and a critic of the 
New New Math, is baffled by this natural-learning approach. If kids learn so well by 
themselves, she asks, why have schools? "The assumption that, if children wander 
aimlessly they will automatically find all the prizes that are out there educationally is 
totally ludicrous," she says.</P>
<P>	Despite the rhetoric about parental involvement, administrators favor things that 
parents don't like. A poll by Public Agenda found that 86 percent of respondents want 
students to learn arithmetic "by hand" before they use calculators. But a 1993 survey 
found that 82 percent of math educators thought that "early use of calculators will 
improve children's problem-solving skills and not prevent the learning of arithmetic."</P>
<P>	If educators want parents to be involved in public education, it certainly isn't 
because teachers and administrators value their views. Parents in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District and elsewhere complain they have been systematically frozen out of 
power in school-based councils. The message: Be seen and not heard.</P>
<P>	And maybe cough up some money for a field trip, books, or computers.</P>
<P>	New New Math programs effectively freeze parents out in another way. Even as 
New New Math mavens ostensibly increase parental involvement, many new curricula 
don't even include textbooks. "The concept of what they mean by parental involvement 
in these materials implies the parents should be involved," says DiMarco, "but then tells 
parents not to impose their own math learning styles and knowledge on their children. 
And worst of all, when the student doesn't get what is going on in class and the parent 
has to help with the homework, too often the parent will be confronted with only a 
worksheet. There is no textbook that explains the work to be done--leaving the parent 
and the student without another alternative than just the teacher's explanation."</P>
<P>	Sadly, parents are often the first to embrace parental education, even if their 
parents rarely helped them. A generation ago, it was believed that children learned best 
by working through their studies on their own. Somewhere along the way, educrats 
abandoned that notion and began to insist that parents assist with the homework.</P>
</P>	In addition, the proliferation of AIDS, teen pregnancy, and single-parent families 
have led many to demand that schools take on responsibilities that parents 20 or 30 years 
ago would never have dreamed of giving up. Today, the generation that believed in 
questioning authority is asking the authorities to raise their kids.</P>

<H3>Wrong Target</H3>
<P>	Brace yourselves--things may grow worse. Petaluma has begun a pilot program 
for grade-school counseling called SUCCESS, an acronym for "Self Understanding Can 
Create Everlasting Secure Selves." Counselor Susi Brodie told the <I>Petaluma Argus-
Courier</I> that counseling children often involves counseling parents.</P>
<P>	Big Mother's attention wrongly falls upon functioning families. Neglectful 
parents aren't going to roll out the cookie dough to teach shapes; only families who 
already bond with their children will. Troubled students largely lack structure, not 
attention.</P>
<P>	Two years ago, I rode in a van operated by the San Juan Unified School District, 
in Sacramento. The 35-foot van housed the district's mobile Student Attendance Review 
Board (S.A.R.B.). According to Carolynn Salter, the district's child welfare and 
attendance counselor, the district purchased a van for S.A.R.B. hearings because parents 
frequently failed to show up for their children's truancy hearings.</P>
<P>	The four students the van visited that day were in elementary school. One 
kindergartner had missed 57 days, while his second-grade sister had missed 66. Their 
prognosis was frightful: They were both to be kept back a grade. The boy couldn't even 
use scissors.</P>
<P>	Schools and government should intervene in such clear-cut cases of severe child 
neglect. But Big Mother does not have the stomach to deal with these messes. A bill 
sponsored by the late B.T. Collins, a GOP assemblyman, that would have ended welfare 
benefits for parents with truant children never made it out of committee.</P>
<P>	Instead of getting tough with parents who don't provide their children with basic 
needs--nutrition, shelter, education, stability--the schools have turned their attention 
where it is needed least. </P>
<P>	They target parents who provide for their children and are well-meaning and 
gullible enough to be taken in by faddish curricula. The parental-involvement movement 
seeks to teach parents to  value self-esteem over academics. This is a clever ploy by a 
system that is shortchanging American children. </P>
<P>	As happens in so many areas these days, the government is treating good people

     Latest Blow to Spending Myth <P>
     Another Success for Reform in Milwaukee 
<P>

SCHOOL REFORM SWEEPS ACROSS NATION 
<P>
     Advocates of serious education reform are taking heart at the
recent explosion of state-level initiatives.  Many measures have been
enacted and more soon will be put to legislators or the voters.  Some
of them are:
<P>
California.  
<P>     One of the most closely watched reform initiatives is Proposition
174, a referendum on the November ballot in California.  If passed, it
would enable the parents of nearly 5.3 million California
schoolchildren to begin receiving vouchers worth $2,600 in state
funds, or 50 percent of the average per-pupil public school
expenditure, to help pay for their child to attend a private school 
(sectarian included) if they wished. 
<P>
     Leading the opposition to Proposition 174 is a broad coalition of
elected officials, newspapers, civil rights organizations, and the
California education establishment.  With the National Education
Association (NEA) leading the way, opponents of Proposition 174 have
raised $8.9 million, compared with the $718,000 amassed by supporters
of the proposition.  The NEA's affiliate, the California Teachers
Association, recently assessed all members $63 to help fund the anti-
Proposition 174 effort.
<P>
     The pro-voucher forces have tried to make the central issue of
the proposal the fierce opposition of teacher unions and bureaucrats. 
Ken Khachigian, the voucher campaign's chief strategist, believes that
this is the key to success in November.  "I love these kinds of
battles.  It's going up against people who have arrogantly accumulated
power and arrogantly wield it."
<P>
     With the election fast approaching, the outcome appears close. 
An October 21 Los Angeles Times poll has the measure losing, 56
against to 26 percent in favor, with 18 percent still undecided. 
However, in an off-year election, with no more than 35 percent of the
voters expected to show, opponents are not confident of victory.
<P>
Puerto Rico.  
  <P>   Another sweeping measure has already made it to the statute book. 
Puerto Rico's Governor Pedro Rossello, on September 3,  signed into
law a bill creating an education voucher system potentially as radical
as that about to be voted on in California.  The vouchers, which are
limited to $1,500, allow families the opportunity to choose which
public or private school their child will attend.  The new law also
offers high school students the chance to take university-level
courses.
<P>
     Governor Rossello claims that the idea behind the program is to
broaden the educational choices for students.  As he made clear
shortly after signing the bill, "This is not a matter of good schools
versus bad schools.  Who will decide which is which?  Who will have
that power?  That's very simple -- the family."
<P>
     The $10 million pilot project went into effect immediately after
it was passed, despite the fact that the administrative unit which
will review applications has not yet been set up.  About one percent
of the public school population will be eligible during the first
year, with plans to expand later.  The state legislature will review
the project in September 1997, when it will "determine whether it
should continue, modify, or amplify the program."
<P>
Michigan.  
 <P>    Governor John Engler and the legislature recently eliminated all
state property taxes earmarked for schools, or about two-thirds of the
state's public education money.  As Governor Engler noted, "We've been
trying to do something about property taxes and school reform for two
decades.  It was time to do something drastic."  Engler is now
proposing to raise the sales tax and give each child's parents $4,500
to spend on their current schools, on other public schools, or on one
of the "charter public schools" that he would authorize any public
authority or group of teachers to create.
<P>
     The Governor hopes that the tax revolt will end the political
power of the most powerful teacher's union in the state, the Michigan
Chapter of the National Education Association.  With almost 70 percent
of school funding eliminated by the new law, Michigan has only until
fiscal year 1995 to come up with a new means of funding education. 
School reform proponents hope that the crisis will force a
consideration of revolutionary cost-saving measures and reforms. 
<P>
     Michigan certainly needs a shakeup in its school system.  The
state ranks 16th in school spending but 39th in students' SAT scores. 
Engler, who has already ruled out an income tax, hopes his plan will
put some competition into the Michigan public school system.  The
Michigan constitution currently prohibits public aid to private
schools.  Thus, the constitution must be amended before a private
school choice program could be implemented.
<P>
Georgia.  
  <P>   School choice advocates recently uncovered a 32-year-old statute
which permits any child between the ages of six and nineteen to
receive an "education grant" to pay all or part of the tuition at a
non-sectarian private school. 
<P>
     The law, approved by the Georgia legislature in 1961, originally
was passed to enable white students to flee desegregated public
schools.  Ironically, Atlanta lawyer Glenn Delk, who stumbled onto the
law by accident, now hopes to use the law to help poor, inner-city
children go to the private school of their choice.  Delk and the
Georgia Public Policy Foundation are urging parents to go to their
local school boards and demand funds for private schools.  Despite the
law, the Georgia education establishment has refused to provide these
funds, claiming that it will ruin public education.  State school
Superintendent Werner Rogers says he will ask the legislature to
repeal the law in January, when it next meets.  If the state does not
comply with the law and hand out the funds soon, Delk says parents
will file a lawsuit against the state.  School choice enthusiasts
estimate that each student would be entitled to as much as $3,800
under the law. 
<P>
Wisconsin.  
  <P>   Low-income families in Wisconsin, with the help of the Kansas
City-based Landmark Legal Foundation, are asking a federal court in
Milwaukee to declare unconstitutional the Milwaukee Parental Choice
Program's ban on religious school participation.  These low-income
families have been turned away from the plan, which provides a $1,600
voucher for children to attend the private non-sectarian school of
their choice,  because the participating private schools have limited
space.
<P>
     The lawsuit is being brought under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
Land-mark's attorneys claim the prohibition on the use of a voucher at
a religious school is a violation of the plaintiff's constitutional
rights to the free exercise of religion and equal protection under the
law.  Landmark President Jerald L.  Hill declares that "The Milwaukee
school choice plan has been a tremendous success for those fortunate
enough to participate, but the plan's unconstitutional exclusion of
religious schools deprives hundreds of children access.  We want to
remove that barrier to educational opportunity for low-income children
in Milwaukee."
<P>
     Wisconsin State Representative Polly Williams, who steered the
Milwaukee plan through the legislature, enthusiastically endorses the
lawsuit.  "I am thrilled that Landmark Legal Foundation has returned," 
says Williams, "to help us empower more low-income families with
school choice opportunities.  Landmark's representation gives low-
income parents a fighting chance against the mammoth education
establishment." 
<P>
     The lawsuit will have important repercussions throughout the
school reform movement.  With California and other jurisdictions such
as Jersey City, New Jersey, including religious schools in their
proposals, the Milwaukee case could be crucial in finally clarifying
"church and state" issues in the politics of education choice.  This
could be the case that will finally bring genuine reform to the
American educational system.

PROFILE:  BUSINESSMEN LEAD CHOICE MOVEMENT
<P>
     As many business leaders struggle in their efforts to reform
America's failing schools, two business leaders, Joseph Alibrandi and
Bret Schundler, are having a profound impact on the education reform
debate.
<P>
     Joseph Alibrandi is CEO of the Los Angeles-based Whittaker
Corporation, a $190 million aerospace supplier, and is spearheading
Proposition 174, the California school choice initiative.  Formerly
chairman of the California Business Roundtable's Education Task Force,
Alibrandi believes that the biggest problem in education is the system
itself.  He is convinced that it will not be long before other top
business leaders will come to exactly the same conclusion that he did: 
school choice is the only hope for America's education system. 
Alibrandi maintains that until parents have the power to choose the
best school for their child, and can move education dollars to their
chosen school, the system will continue to fail the children. 
<P>

     Alibrandi emphasizes that school choice means the most to poor,
inner-city youngsters since they cannot afford to write out a check
for a private school or easily move to another neighborhood to find a
better school.  The only way to help these young-sters, he says, is to
allow an effective marketplace in learning to emerge through parental
choice.  Alibrandi is state chairman of A Better Choice, the state
organization behind Proposition 174, which will be on the November
ballot in California.
<P>
     Another businessman taking an active role in reforming the school
system is newly reelected Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler.  A 34-
year-old former executive at Salomon Bro-thers, the Wall Street
investment firm, Schundler overcame the city's long-entrenched
Democratic machine in November 1992 to become Jersey City's first
Republican mayor since World War I.  In May 1993, 68 percent of Jersey
City voters reelected Schund-ler to a full four-year term in a city
that is only 6 percent Republican. 
<P>
     One of Schundler's top promises is to put into place a radical
school-choice plan for Jersey City.  Like Alibrandi, he now believes
the key to reform is to allow parents to choose the school that best
fits their child's needs.  Schundler argues that "The root of our
problem is how government is spending our money -- the tremendously
low productivity of government spending because of its fixation on
bureaucratic approaches."
<P>
     Schundler hopes to introduce his school choice bill to the New
Jersey legislature early next year.  He will need a majority in the
legislature -- and possibly two-thirds -- if Governor Jim Florio wins
reelection in November and vetoes the plan.  If the bill passes,
Jersey City will be the first American city to have a city-wide school
voucher system 
<P>
     Alibrandi and Schundler are giving new hope and direction to the
many business leaders who have grown frustrated with
business/education partnerships that cost a great deal of corporate
dollars and yet often do not lead to tangible improvements.

FORTUNE HOLDS SIXTH ANNUAL EDUCATION SUMMIT
<P>
     In September, Fortune magazine sponsored its sixth annual
education conference in Washington, DC.  Participating were over three
hundred leaders in education reform, drawn from government, business,
and academia.  The conference, entitled "How Far Have We Come?" 
evaluated business efforts to reform education.
<P>
     Speakers at the conference included Secretary of Education
Richard W.  Riley, Massachusetts Senator Edward M.  Kennedy,
Pennsylvania Representative William F.  Goodling, Michigan Governor
John R.  Engler, and David T.  Kearns, Chairman and CEO of the New
American Schools Development Corporation.
<P>
     Many speakers pointed out the education reform achievements of
the business community, but both speak-ers and participants agreed
that these have only been modest.  As Fortune Managing Editor Marshall
Loeb said, "Education reform is clearly not happening fast enough. ..
.. ..  In this increasingly competitive global economy, our students
must be more than adequately prepared for the challenges that the
rapidly changing market demands." 
<P>
     Although school choice and other innovative reform ideas were not
discussed as much as they had been in some past summits, Governor
Engler urged business leaders to push for structural changes in the
education system.  Engler discussed the elimination of school property
taxes in Michigan, charter schools, and school choice.  He claimed
that most present-day reforms have been "tinkering around the edge of
the system" and failed to make a real difference.
<P>
     The November 1 issue of Fortune will cover the Education Summit.
<P>
     
ONCE AGAIN, SPENDING ISN'T EVERYTHING
<P>
     A state-by-state analysis, issued September 9 by the Washington,
D.C.-based American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the nation's
largest private, bipartisan membership association of state
legislators, is the latest blow to the notion that increased school
spending is the key to better education.  The ALEC survey, A Report
Card on American Education:  A State-by-State Analysis 1972-73 - 1992-
93, is the first extensive study since the U.S.  Department of
Education ceased publishing the State Education Performance Chart in
1990. 
<P>
     Since 90 percent of all school funding accrues at the state and
local level, ALEC's state-by-state figures are a better guide to
spending and results than the more frequently used federal funding
figures.  School spending has increased by 390 percent over a twenty-
year period (47 percent in constant 1992 dollars) while school
enrollment has decreased by 7 percent during the same period.
<P>
     The study compares state rankings in each of the following
assessments:  scores from the National Assessment of Education
Progress (NAEP), the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), and the American
College Test (ACT), as well as the school graduation rate. 
Consistently among the top ten in three or more of these assessments
were nine states:  Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.  With the exception of
Wisconsin and Wyoming, all these states were in the bottom half in
school spending.  And all of them spent at least 40 percent less than
the state with the highest amount -- New Jersey -- which was $10,561. 
<P>
     The two states showing the great-est overall improvement of test
scores in the past twenty years in the SATs were Mississippi (up 151
points, to rank 16th in the nation) and Alabama (up 146 points, to
rank 14th).  In terms of current annual school spending, they rank
50th and 40th, respectively.
<P>
     Although a few states with high spending levels do achieve high
academic rankings, there are just as many -- if not more -- states
scoring high while spending less (See BEI #29).  This shows that money
does not correlate with better quality. 
<P>

Card at ALEC, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C.  20002,
or call (202) 547-4646.
<P>
     
SURVEY SAYS PAVE PROGRAM A SUCCESS
<P>
     According to a survey released by Family Service America, Inc., a
nonprofit organization headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
Milwaukee's Partners Advancing Values in Education (PAVE) private
voucher program has successfully involved parents of low-income
students in their child-ren's education.
<P>
     PAVE is a non-profit volunteer  organization established to
provide families equal access to educational opportunities.  In 1992,
PAVE established a scholarship program designed to help low-income
families attend private and parochial schools in Milwaukee.  The
program funds half of the yearly tuition of children whose families
qualify to receive federal lunch programs. 
<P>
     The survey of 955 low-income parents whose children received
scholarships from the PAVE program found that parents are pleased and
that a majority of the parents are involved in school functions.  Some
96 percent of parents participate in school conferences while 67
percent regularly attend school meetings and 63 percent attend school
activities.
<P>
     According to the survey, parents of students in the PAVE program
also take an active role in their children's education at home.  The
survey found 94 percent of the parents read to their elementary school
children, the same percentage help with math problems, and 85 percent
assist with penmanship and writing assignments each week.  As one
mother of a PAVE scholarship student noted, "PAVE has dispelled the
myth that poor parents don't care about their children's education."
<P>
     Besides being involved in their children's education and school
activities, the parents are overwhelmingly satisfied with their
school, teachers, principals, and the amount their child is learning. 
Among the respondents, 90 percent of PAVE parents are satisfied with
their school choice.  Even the few parents (10 percent) who were
dissatisfied with their school choice were careful to point out in
their written comments that they were satisfied with the PAVE program
itself.  In addition, 96 percent were satisfied with the teachers in
their child's school, and 93 percent were also satisfied with the
principals.  The survey found that 96 percent of the parents were
satisfied with the amount their child was learning.
<P>
     Overall, the survey indicates that after the first year of the
PAVE program, it is well on its way to accomplishing the mission of
"providing the financial means for low-income parents to choose the
school best suited to their child's needs, just as more affluent
parents have done for years."
<P>
     For more information, write PAVE at 1434 West State Street,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53233, or call (414) 747-1580.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT></B>peaking in Galesburg, Illinois, in January, President Clinton proposed a federally 
funded job-training program "to keep the American Dream alive in the 21st century." 
Cost to American taxpayers: $3.5 billion a year.</P>
<P>	If he had driven about an hour north, Clinton could have visited a college campus 
that proves his program is unnecessary. DeVry Institute of Technology, headquartered in 
Oakbrook, Illinois, makes a handsome profit by offering a first-rate technical education to 
working-class students. This little-known school shows how private businesses 
outperform government in providing good job training.</P>
<P>	On 13 campuses from Atlanta to Los Angeles, more than 15,000 students--35 
percent of whom are black or Latino--are earning their bachelor's of science degrees at 
DeVry. Ninety-four percent of the school's graduates land jobs in their fields of study 
within six months, with an average starting salary exceeding $24,000 a year.</P>
<P>	DeVry's alumni enjoy cutting-edge technical careers. At Hughes 
Communications, the nation's largest satellite company, 22 of the 30 engineers 
responsible for orbit maintenance are DeVry graduates. KLA Instruments, which designs 
quality-control systems for the manufacture of microchips, boasts that a fifth of its 1,000 
employees graduated from DeVry. All this at an annual cost per student of $2,500 less 
than similar state-run programs.</P>
<P>	And DeVry posted a $12-million profit on revenues of  $211 million last year to 
boot.</P>

<H3>Selling Job Opportunity</H3>
<P>	Since its founding in 1931 by Herman DeVry, the inventor of the portable 
motion-picture projector, the institute has specialized in technical training that leads to 
lucrative careers. DeVry, which grants accredited bachelor's degrees, is a for-profit 
venture whose stock trades on the NASDAQ exchange. In short, it sells job opportunity.</P>
<P>	Five years ago, when Zaneta Rizzo graduated from a small high school in rural 
Louisiana, she "knew less than nothing" about computers, thought DOS was pronounced 
"dose," and was terrified of automatic-teller machines.</P>
<P>	After two years of bouncing among jobs in fast-food restaurants, Rizzo enrolled at 
DeVry's Dallas campus. Recently she graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer 
information systems and is deciding between several job offers with computer-training 
firms. Before DeVry, Rizzo's salary peaked at $760 a month. Her current offers are for 
$25,000 a year--a 275 percent pay hike.</P>
<P>	When Jeri Gomez graduated from high school near Fresno, California, she 
enrolled in a local community college to study the health sciences and dance, but classes 
were constantly being canceled, so she enlisted in the army. After serving in Desert 
Storm, Gomez enrolled at DeVry's Pomona campus. She is now deciding among several 
job offers in software programming that pay more than $30,000 a year.</P>
<P>	Rizzo's and Gomez's stories are typical of DeVry students, many of whom field 
multiple job offers before their commencement. In fact, more than 95 percent of 
engineering and accounting majors are placed in their fields within six months of 
graduation--a success rate many of the nation's top schools never approach. How does 
DeVry do it? By running the college like a business.</P>
<P>	Unlike most colleges, DeVry receives no direct government money or alumni 
gifts. Nearly all revenues, and therefore profits, come from tuition. And DeVry has found 
that the best way to attract more students--over half of whom are the first in their 
families to attend college--is to secure high-paying jobs for graduates. Dennis Keller, 
DeVry's chief executive officer, says the school avoids anything that doesn't help 
students find careers.</P>
<P>	To this end, DeVry maintains an enormous placement system with more than 100 
staffers and a database of thousands of employers. While most other schools in the 
country assign placement officers to handle a broad spectrum of careers, DeVry has 
found that employers prefer to communicate with staffers who understand their particular 
needs. For this reason, each officer is trained in a specific field. For instance, Motorola--
which is based near DeVry's DuPage County campus in northern Illinois--works closely 
with staffers specializing in telecommunications. The payoff has been tremendous. When 
the electronics giant was planning a major expansion in Illinois, it consulted DeVry 
placement officials in advance to secure an educated labor force.</P>
<P>	DeVry also edges out the competition by studying labor trends, nationally as well 
as in the local markets near each campus. DeVry does not depend on the federal 
government's research, which is mostly retrospective; its researchers analyze new and 
growing fields. Using data from interviews with small and large employers, annual 
alumni surveys, and more than a dozen local-industry advisory panels, DeVry graduates 
can target rapidly emerging areas that traditional schools miss. Relying on data from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, for instance, most colleges until recently paid little attention to 
the cellular industry. DeVry officials, on the other hand, adjusted their 
telecommunications curriculum eight years ago to include this technology, and 
subsequently launched the careers of many graduates. "Health care is the next big one," 
says Norman Metz, a senior vice president at DeVry. "We are currently focusing on the 
medical-equipment industry that will handle the graying of America."</P>
<P>	Despite these unsurpassed placement results, the Clinton administration has 
frowned upon for-profit schools like DeVry, insisting the capitalist model leads to a 
useless education. At a 1993 press conference, Labor Secretary Robert Reich told 
journalists to be wary of these institutions, claiming that they mismatch thousands of 
students, and that there is no market for their degrees. Reich's warning was reiterated by 
the media, including the Cleveland Plain Dealer, which urged some for-profit schools to 
carry "warning labels" detailing prospective students' chances of finding employment 
after graduation. In fact, if many state schools had to publish such information, students 
would likely flock to DeVry.</P>

<H3>Blood, Sweat, and Jobs</H3>
<P>	Some for-profit trade schools, to be sure, are little more than diploma mills that 
give gullible students a shlock education. These schools usually go bankrupt when 
students catch on that their degree leads nowhere. But for an institution that is in business 
for the long haul, producing high-quality education for satisfied customers is essential to 
growth and profitability. Keller believes that every graduate represents the school: If an 
employer is unsatisfied with the quality of a single graduate's work, he is unlikely to hire 
from DeVry in the future. That would ultimately harm the bottom line.</P>
<P>	To that end, the school maintains a demanding curriculum that students call 
"brutal" and Keller calls "tough love." It is a no-frills, lots-of-sweat education. The 
rigorous process begins even before the classes start. Although the school accepts SAT 
and ACT test scores--applicants average at the 45th percentile--all students are required 
to take DeVry's admissions test in math. About 14 percent of the applicants fail the exam. 
Of the remaining students, about a quarter are admitted on the condition that they take 
remedial classes. Applicants are also required to take a College Board English test that 
determines their placement in humanities courses.</P>
<P>	From the first day, students follow the curriculum in lockstep. There are no 
electives. Students immediately choose a major from among five fields: electronics-
engineering technology, computer information systems, business operations, 
telecommunications management, or accounting. Each major requires eight or nine 
semesters, and can be completed in three years with summer school.</P>
<P>	Students and DeVry's senior management both prefer this inflexible system. Like 
a manufacturer, the school desires a reputation for providing a consistent "product"; 
students say they enjoy receiving firm direction. "This gets rid of a lot of the time-
wasting filler classes, like underwater basket-weaving, that people take elsewhere," 
recalls Rose Huening, a 1986 graduate.</P>

<H3>Heavy Lifting</H3>
<P>	Here there is no time to waste. Each term, DeVry students take at least four 
classes, plus labs, often exceeding a conventional courseload by four to six credit hours. 
The first-year courseload for computer information systems is typical: five computer-
science classes, four computer labs, two math courses and a math lab, two English 
courses with one writing lab, an economics course, a psychology course, and a business 
course. In addition, since many of the students have never before been pushed to work so 
hard, all freshmen enroll in a class on "success strategies," which teaches study skills and 
time-management techniques.</P>
<P>	George Dean, the vice president for educational planning, believes that many 
traditional colleges waste a great deal of energy embracing new teaching methods. DeVry 
doesn't mandate teaching methods--professors can choose whatever textbooks they 
want--but the level of academic expectations is set at the head office, and it's set high. 
"At the end of the course, the students have to be able to do x and y and z," Dean says. 
"If it works better at the Columbus campus to teach it z then y then x, it doesn't bother 
me."</P>
<P>	Dean is comfortable giving the professors ample latitude because they are 
required to gain real-world experience in their field, and so tend to prefer the most 
practical methods. Although some students earn money for tuition by assisting faculty 
members, they are prohibited from teaching, and are usually limited to grading papers.</P>
<P>	Unlike trade schools that teach specific skills (many of which become obsolete as 
technology changes), DeVry's curriculum focuses on teaching students how to reason. In 
many ways, DeVry offers the liberal-arts version of a technical education: students learn 
how to solve technical problems. They are drilled thoroughly on the basics, and required 
to spend countless hours in the lab to build an educational foundation. On exams, 
students are rarely asked straight-forward mathematical questions; instead, they are 
usually given detailed descriptions of real-world problems, including information they 
must recognize as extraneous. Dean claims that this education prepares students to 
operate efficiently in the business world. Furthermore, teachers will fail students whose 
lab reports are not written in proper English, regardless of the experiment's outcome. 
DeVry doesn't shortchange the humanities, because these non-technical abilities will be 
vital to the students' careers. Alumni routinely tell Dean that the technical skills get them 
hired and the reasoning skills get them promoted.</P>
<P>	 A student with a grade point average below a "C" is placed on academic 
probation, and prohibited from taking a relaxed schedule. If the student's g.p.a. remains 
below a "C" average the following semester, he or she is expelled. Every year, 20 percent 
of the student body flunks out. DeVry does not pamper its students en route to the 
diploma. "We have hard classes, but if that is not met with enough commitment to be 
successful, then it is detrimental to this company for that student to stay," Keller says. 
Huening's class is a perfect example: of the 325 students who started, only 94 graduated 
on time.</P> 
<P>	Just as auto manufacturers are constantly reviewing the efficiency of their cars, 
DeVry maintains strict quality control. About a decade ago, DeVry was reviewing each 
course every three years, which was considered swift compared to traditional schools. 
Now it rewrites each course at least once a year. During the summer term, faculty 
members visit hundreds of employers across the nation and find out what their needs will 
be in five to 10 years. Together with information offered by industry leaders on DeVry's 
dozen or so curriculum-advisory boards, the school sets new course requirements. For 
instance, a few years ago most computer-programming courses only taught a 
programming language called COBOL, but professors noted that firms near some of their 
campuses were switching from mainframes to desktop-based systems that require C 
language. After DeVry adjusted its curriculum, businesses responded by hiring more of 
its graduates. Although industry does not dictate DeVry's curriculum, the school must 
measure success and failure by its placement rate.</P>
<P>	The institute's educational audit is exhaustive. DeVry's central headquarters 
evaluates randomly selected writing samples from students on every campus twice a year 
in order to ensure that writing skills remain high. The institute also administers 
standardized tests in electronics to be certain that technical skills are not dropping. 
Finally, administrators also investigate courses with unusual grade distribution.</P>
<P>	The best evidence of the quality of DeVry's curriculum is the on-the-job success 
of its graduates. Bill Buglewicz, a senior manufacturing manager at KLA Instruments, 
recruits at six of the campuses every year. "DeVry students have a great work ethic, 
higher motivation, and initiative," Buglewicz says. "The courseload, in particular the 
exhaustive lab work, makes them wonderful thinkers and troubleshooters."</P> 
<P>	Gary Nuzzi, a 1983 graduate, says the lab work helped him and 1963 graduate 
Bill Blethen develop a revolutionary lighting system that won an Academy Award for 
technical achievement last year. The portable strobe light allows movie cameras to 
capture detail at high speed. "The education was, at times, very challenging, but very 
practical," Nuzzi adds.</P> 

<H3>The Bottom Line</H3>
<P>	Most remarkable, however, is that DeVry makes a profit. By defining its mission 
narrowly, the school has perfected its product and minimized waste. DeVry's cost-saving 
efforts are immediately evident. There are no ivy-laden academic halls or rolling greens. 
Rather, each DeVry campus holds its classes in an office building that is usually 
surrounded by a parking lot. In such a modern facility, little space is wasted, maintenance 
costs are moderate, and classrooms can accommodate professors from various 
departments. And the school runs three cycles of classes--morning, afternoon, and 
evening--to use the space more efficiently. The institute does not own any dormitories. 
Instead, DeVry leases housing near its campuses from local landlords and sublets it to the 
students at a modest profit.</P>
<P>	DeVry also holds down costs by maintaining a narrow academic focus. DeVry 
does not fund any sports teams or clubs that are not directly related to job placement; on 
some campuses, students independently run intramural leagues by securing outside 
sponsors. "We are not trying to be all things to all people," says Kathy Perdue, head of 
the accounting department at the Atlanta campus. "We figured out what we do best, 
concentrating on the academics to get jobs, not filling social needs."</P>
<P>	The school does not grant tenure to any of its professors, allowing it to respond 
quickly to fluctuating enrollments. Moreover, DeVry is not a research or publishing 
institution, so faculty members carry teaching loads two to three times that of other 
college professors. Finally, since the school operates at full capacity, even in the 
summers, professors are expected to work as they would in private industry: year-round.
<P>	DeVry maximizes tuition revenue by actively recruiting students through 
television and newspaper advertising, direct mail, and recruiters. A traveling sales force 
of 200 visits high schools and Army bases throughout North America, while another 100 
salespeople respond to applicants who call DeVry in response to advertising. DeVry's 
$15-million advertising campaign promotes its focus on careers, profiling graduates with 
senior positions in prominent companies like Coca-Cola.</P>
<P>	The individual cost-saving measures add up. The price tag of a DeVry education 
is $6,015 for two semesters, or $26,730 for the complete degree. By comparison, a four-
year degree at public, non-research universities in the same states where DeVry operates 
costs much more in tuition and taxpayer subsidies: $40,148 in California, for instance, 
and $35,440 in Georgia.</P>
<P>	As an accredited school, DeVry participates in all the same financial aid programs 
as public schools. DeVry's loan default rate is 17 percent--better than many for-profit 
trade schools and far below the government's intervention zone of 25 to 30 percent. 
Industry analysts note that the institute's job placement record and bachelor's degree 
program distinguishes it from trade schools.</P>
<P>	For-profit schools such as DeVry are a model for the future of university 
education. As more adults return to school later in life, they will find they prefer the no-
nonsense DeVry degree, which can be finished in three years. Currently the average age 
of DeVry students is 26. In addition, the number of high-school graduates is expected to 
keep rising through 2013. Combine that statistic with downsizing in the military, for-
profit education's top rival for high-school graduates, and DeVry seems to enjoy a rosy 
outlook. In fact, the results are already beginning to show: Enrollment was up 4 percent 
this year, and the company added two new campuses. "Frankly, the demand is growing 
quicker than our ability to supply it," says Norman Levine, DeVry's chief financial 
officer. And two other for-profit college-education companies announced initial public 
offerings this year.</P>
<P>	Despite DeVry's proven track record in securing jobs for working-class students, 
bureaucrats may prevent the school from expanding. In New York City, for example, the 
state's department of education has not yet approved DeVry's 1993 accreditation 
application. Once the department okays the school's academic standards, government 
analysts will determine DeVry's impact on established local schools. Every college in 
New York City will be invited to comment on DeVry's entrance into the market. If area 
schools fear DeVry will steal students from their tuition rolls, they can urge the 
department to reject the application. The Education Department's Bureau of Planning will 
also analyze whether the local job market can accommodate the future DeVry graduates. 
Department officials note that, due to understaffing, it normally takes several years for a 
school's 300-page application to be approved.</P>
<P>	Even skeptics of for-profit education concede that public schools and private non-
profits are unable to expand to meet the growing demand. Public universities would 
require greater tax subsidies to support a larger student base, and private non-profits 
would have to raise even more through alumni giving. "Time and time again, we have 
seen that the healthiest and best systems in the world involve private enterprise 
competing," says Keller. "We're the future of education."</P>

<p>
Buried deep within one of the many articles that sought to account for the tragic suicide of Kurt Cobain last year was a most surprising revelation. According to Village Voice writer Sarah Ferguson, the grunge-rock pioneer's favorite television shows included Leave It to Beaver and Mayberry, R.F.D.<p>
That a cutting-edge cultural icon married to alternative rock's premier feminist (Courtney Love, of the band Hole) could have such retrograde, politically incorrect viewing tastes was, in Ferguson's mind, "odd." But it was also revealing. Grunge rock "is music for kids who grew up too fast," Ferguson says. "It engages in a kind of mournful nostalgia for a childhood without violation." <p>
Cobain was certainly no stranger to violation. Every significant examination of his life regards the divorce of his parents as a major turning point. In fact, so painful were Cobain's memories of the divorce that he once held a gun to his head and told his wife, "I'd rather die than divorce."<p>
Clearly, one does not have to regard Mayberry as nirvana in order to believe that Cobain and many members of his generation would have fared far better if they had grown up in something resembling Beaver Cleaver's neighborhood. Yet, few people today—even conservatives—are prepared to confront the problem that first sent Cobain's young life reeling. Indeed, when Dan Quayle returned last year to the San Francisco club where he gave his famous 1992 Murphy Brown speech, he was quick to point out that when he spoke of the problems surrounding single-parent families, he wasn't referring to "households where the father has died, or even where he is separated by divorce." Rather, Quayle said, he was referring to "those households that have never known a father."<p>
Now, in fairness to Quayle, he also noted that "the ideal situation for our children is to be born and raised in an intact family." Nevertheless, by suggesting that divorce has more in common with death (which is almost always involuntary) than with illegitimacy (almost always voluntary), Quayle's remarks contribute to the trivialization of divorce at a time when social scientists are increasingly likely to agree that the impact of divorce on children is almost always negative and often devastating.<p>
Indeed, as Barbara Dafoe Whitehead argued in her celebrated article on family break-up in the Atlantic Monthly, divorce—like illegitimacy—is strongly linked to a wide variety of negative outcomes for children, from child abuse and neglect to serious juvenile crime. A 1994 study of juveniles in the Wisconsin correction system found that 1 in 3 came from divorced or separated homes. Several studies show that unmarried girls whose parents divorce are much more likely to engage in premarital sex and get pregnant out of wedlock than girls from intact households. A 1994 study by researchers at Duke and North Carolina State University reported that family dissolution is a stronger predictor of suicide for young males than such factors as unemployment.<p>
Despite the clear impact of family break-up on children, "some people aren't comfortable talking about divorce and adultery," former Education Secretary William Bennett told a Christian Coalition conference last year. "But it seems to me we have to talk about them. They are before us, and they have great consequences."<p>
Great indeed. The number of children directly affected by divorce has more than doubled in a generation, from 463,000 in 1960 to 985,000 in 1991. Until political and cultural leaders give proper attention to the link between divorce and many of our nation's most serious social problems—crime, poverty, educational decline—we stand little chance of reversing these trends. <p> <b><center>Too Close to Home</b></center>
<p>
One of the obvious reasons there is less public handwringing about divorce than illegitimacy is because divorce hits closer to home in middle America. As Chester Finn of the Hudson Institute recently observed, "Whereas illegitimacy happens mostly among people who live on the other side of the tracks, much divorce and separation takes place in 'our' own neighborhoods, indeed among our friends and relations, and sometimes even ourselves." Divorce is subject to the phenomenon Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan calls "defining deviancy down," in which a society loses its capacity to define certain problems as problems because of their sheer prevalence. Illegitimacy, conversely, continues to be viewed as "deviant" because it is still fairly rare among the middle and upper classes.<p>
It is frequently asserted that half of all marriages end in divorce. The number, derived by comparing the annual number of marriages to the annual number of divorces, overstates the likelihood of a failed first marriage.  This is because the number is skewed upward by the experience of men and women who have gone through divorce many times. The truth is that about one quarter of all adults who have ever been married in America today have also experienced divorce.<p>
Still, divorce is common enough that to raise concerns about it publicly is to risk being impolitic. As Bennett puts it, "The rules are broken down. If you leave your wife and get yourself a 'trophy wife,' you're not going to be greeted with condemnation or even a raised eye by most people, because it has become a convention."<p>
Not only has this convention stifled debate, but it has helped create an expectation of marital failure that can be seen throughout our culture. A recent cartoon in a major publication depicted one young adult saying to another, "It's only marriage I'm proposing after all, not a lifetime commitment." Similarly, in a recent Newsweek story on divorce, one young woman explained why she limited the guest list at her wedding to 70 people, less than one third the size of her sister's wedding list: "I was afraid to make that much of an investment," she said. "What if it didn't work out? Then, I'd have to tell all those people." <p>
Such apprehensions about marriage are especially common among those whose parents have split up. A study by Pamela Webster, a sociologist at Brown University, found that adults whose parents had divorced rated their own chances of divorcing to be considerably higher than did adults whose parents had not divorced. This finding held up even when comparing groups of couples who rated their marital happiness equally. <p>
Sadly, expectations of marital failure have a way of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Psychologist Silvio Silvestri reports that adult children of divorced parents are four times more likely to get divorced than adult children of intact couples. <p><b><center>The Myth of the Good Divorce</center></b> <p>
Another hindrance to public discussion of marital dissolution  is that many Americans still want to believe that divorce can lead to greater personal fulfillment and stronger relationships between men and women. In the closing scene of the hit movie Mrs. Doubtfire, the central character offers some grandmotherly advice to a young girl trying to come to terms with her parents' break-up. "Some parents, when they're angry, they get along much better when they don't live together," Mrs. Doubtfire says. "They don't fight all the time and they can become better people and much better mommies and daddies." <p>
However much many would like to believe this view of divorce, it is increasingly at odds with the experiences of both children and adults. A study at the University of Oregon found that the impact of divorce on a woman's health and well-being is far more serious than the impact of being fired. Another study, from the University of Alberta, shows that divorced or separated individuals are roughly three times as likely to commit suicide as married people. The University of Texas reports that "divorced men exhibit substantially higher rates of psychological distress and alcohol consumption than do married men." And David Larson of the National Institute for Healthcare Research reports that "being divorced and a non-smoker is only slightly less dangerous than smoking a pack or more a day and staying married."<p>
These and other research findings recently prompted an eclectic group of prominent scholars known as the Council on Families to issue a report decrying the state of marriage in America. The report observed, "In the domain of marriage and family life, our recent explosions of freedom have taken a terrible and largely unexpected toll. Relationships between men and women are not improving; they are becoming more difficult and more unhappy. Many women are experiencing chronic economic insecurity. Many men are isolated and estranged from their children. Many more people are lonely."<p><b><center>Rebuilding the Walls</b></center>
<p>
Over the last three decades, the walls surrounding lifelong marriage have crumbled. The age-old social barriers to divorce, promiscuity, illegitimacy, and cohabitation have been removed in the name of promoting personal freedom and self-expression. A growing number of people—especially those in Cobain's generation—now know first-hand that the walls that were thought to entrap and restrict were really there to protect.<p>
So how can the walls be rebuilt? How can confidence in the institution of marriage be restored? Although it would be a mistake to draw inspiration from the last three decades of welfare-state activism, there are some constructive models for addressing certain social problems. One such model is the anti-smoking movement.<p>
At a time when virtually every other area of American life was becoming more and more permissive, the anti-smoking movement succeeded in convincing the American public to adopt less permissive attitudes about smoking. Not only did many Americans change their own behavior (the proportion of adult smokers fell from 42.4 percent in 1965 to 25.6 percent in 1991), but Americans supported efforts to modify the behavior of others. <p>
The anti-smokers' success was due to many factors, including:<ul>
<li>
The careful collection and dissemination of compelling research on the health risks of smoking and inhaling second-hand smoke;<li>
The effective use of media persuasion, including articles, op-eds, essays, reports, and public-service advertisements;<li>
The tireless pursuit of incremental changes in public policy (limiting sales to minors, banning smoking on airplanes and in public buildings, etc.); <li>
The periodic sponsorship of special events (like the Great American Smoke-Out) to raise public awareness and spur private action;<li>
The ongoing provision of practical services (counseling, support groups, etc.) to people interested in behavioral change.</ul>
<p>
To restore confidence in marriage, we need a similar multidimensional strategy. This strategy should seek to repeat the anti-smokers' success, giving particular emphasis to the following four ideas:<p>
Focus on the future. For many people, the subject of divorce is intensely personal and extremely painful. It evokes bad memories and bitter feelings. As such, no attempt to restore public confidence in the institution of marriage is likely to succeed unless it is forward-looking. <p>
This means focusing public attention on lowering the divorce rate henceforth. And it means giving greater emphasis to the future choices of today's young people than to the choices made by their parents. "It may be unreasonable to expect a widespread change of heart about marriage among today's adults," states the Council on Families. "But young people can and often do strive to rebel, to be idealistic, and to do things differently than their elders."<p>
Indeed, in one marriage-related area—sexuality—there is already evidence of a movement among today's young people to challenge norms ushered in by their parents' generation. In the last few years, hundreds of thousands of young people have joined public campaigns pledging to save sex for marriage, and the proportion of high schoolers who report that they have had sexual intercourse at least once has declined by at least 6 percentage points since 1990.<p>
A youth-oriented campaign extolling the virtues of lifelong marriage is likely to win support from intact married couples. And it should win support as well from many who have experienced divorce, since most divorced parents want marital success for their children every bit as much as intact couples do. 	<p>
Still, success will not come easily. While many children of divorce long for the strong, enduring marriages their parents never had, many are wary of commitment and fear repeating their parents' mistakes. This is one reason cohabitation is so prevalent among the young. Yet, far from increasing the likelihood of marital success, "trial marriages" actually are linked to higher divorce rates. Indeed, a 1991 study published in the Journal of Marriage and the Family found that 40 percent of cohabiting unions disintegrate before marriage, and that marital unions that begin as a cohabiting relationship have a 50 percent higher rate of divorce than those that do not. <p>
Challenge the church. No cultural institution is more important to the restoration of marriage than the religious community. Churches and synagogues claim a time-honored, divinely-ordained role to help couples understand the moral and spiritual nature of their marriage vows. Religious institutions bear a unique responsibility for helping those embarking on and struggling to maintain marriage commitments. Similarly, only faith communities can offer redemptive hope to people who have experienced marital failure.<p>
While religious leaders do not bear full responsibility for the absence of public discourse about divorce, they can hardly blame others for the failure of many marriages. Author Michael McManus notes that many churches have become "blessing machines" that wed interested couples but offer few marriage-related services, like counseling for engaged and married couples, practical advice on how to strengthen troubled marriages, and mentoring programs for younger couples.<p>
Sermons that warn against divorce or condemn the casual termination of marriages are not popular among some ministers, McManus says. Sermons that acknowledge that the Bible prohibits remarriage in some cases (Matthew 5:32) are even less popular, even though unqualified acceptance of divorce and remarriage can only discourage marital perseverance.<p>
The failure of the church (particularly the Protestant church) to significantly influence the surrounding culture can be seen in the fact that four of the six states with the worst divorce rates in the country (Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Tennessee) are found right in the heart of the Bible Belt.<p>
When religious leaders take seriously their responsibility for strengthening marriage in their congregations and their communities, divorce does decline. For example, several years ago, ministers in Peoria, Illinois, adopted a community marriage policy that stated none of the city's churches would marry any couple that had not completed a premarital counseling program. In the three-year period after the pact was adopted, Peoria's divorce rate fell nearly 20 percent.<p>
Elevate marriage in public policy. America's retreat from marriage is first and foremost a problem of the heart. It cannot be fixed by the issuance of a government decree or by the adoption of a new government policy. <p>
This does not mean, however, that reform of public policy has no place in a larger strategy to restore confidence in marriage. The law is a teacher. America's casual attitudes about marital permanence are both reflected in and advanced by laws that permit "no-fault" divorce in cases where one spouse wishes to preserve the union, and by laws that require some married couples to pay dramatically higher taxes than cohabiting couples.<p>
Reversing these misguided policies will not only help those directly affected by them, but will also teach others that lifelong marriage is the normative standard our society upholds. Thus, pro-marriage policy reform is both an end in itself, in that it corrects legal wrongs, and a means to an end, in that it stimulates a broader cultural appreciation of marital permanence.<p>
How, then, do we solve these problems? Michigan's state legislature is considering a divorce-reform proposal that would require the establishment of "fault" in cases where one spouse wants to preserve the marriage. This change (and a similar provision requiring "fault" in cases where children are involved) would make family abandonment more difficult by offering greater legal protection to innocent parties in divorce cases.<p>
In the tax front, three ideas deserve attention. Allan Carlson of the Rockford Institute advocates the resurrection of "income-splitting," a practice that allows married couples to divide their total earnings evenly between them before assessing their tax liability. This practice prevents a second income from kicking couples into a higher tax bracket—whether that second income comes from a wage-earning wife or a moonlighting husband. <p>
Another tax option worth considering is a deduction that would adjust tax liability not just for marital status, but also for marital longevity. Tax benefits that modestly increase with each year that a couple stays together would allow a portion of the societal benefit associated with marital stability to be claimed by those who have been married the longest.<p>
Certainly, one must guard against wildly skewing the tax code to promote social goals. But if divorce truly imposes economic costs on society (higher crime, greater need for remedial education, higher health-care costs, and the like), then it may be beneficial to allow lifelong married partners to pay slightly lower taxes than their contemporaries who are married for the second or third time.<p>
Finally, we should consider eliminating "means-testing" in various government programs, since income-based limits on program eligibility tend to penalize marriage. Some married households with income above the threshold can qualify for benefits if they split up and form two separate households. Likewise, some cohabiting couples able to claim benefits as unmarried individuals would lose their benefits if they were to marry and combine their household income.<p>
Valorize marital toughness. There is a common misconception that couples who have good, solid, enduring marriages are "lucky." Supposedly, happily married couples do not face any of the conflicts and struggles that other couples face. They do not go through rough times or encounter serious relational turbulence.<p>
The truth is, every marriage faces trials and hardships and breakdowns in communication. Yes, some couples manage to limit conflict better than others, but every marriage faces difficulties. Ruth Bell Graham was once asked if she had ever contemplated divorcing her husband, evangelist Billy Graham. "No," she said, "but I have considered murder."<p>
If every marriage faces challenges, why is it that some survive and others do not? According to John Gottman, of the University of Washington at Seattle, couples that succeed work hard at resolving conflict. In his recent book, Why Marriages Succeed or Fail, Gottman argues that many of the theories about why some couples divorce—money problems, sexual disagreements, incompatibility, and so on—fail to explain why other equally dissatisfied couples confronting these very same issues do not split up. The real issue, Gottman concludes, is not money or sex or compatibility. The real issue, instead, is whether couples are willing and able to work out their marital differences.<p>
Research by social scientists Nick Stinnett and John DeFrain shows that one of the seven characteristics commonly found in strong, healthy families is the ability to deal effectively with conflict and crisis. Like Gottman, Stinnett and DeFrain find that couples who have to work through difficult problems believe that experience strengthens their marriages. This is important, because most public discussion about divorce revolves around whether divorce would be better than a marriage in which spouses are fighting all the time. This framework assumes falsely that a marriage gone sour can never be made sweet again. It encourages many couples to throw in the towel prematurely. <p>
David Blankenhorn, the president of the Institute for American Values, argues that a broad spectrum of marriages exists in America today. At one end are a small percentage of marriages that are almost effortlessly blissful; at the other, a small percentage that are headed for almost certain failure. Between these two extremes, Blankenhorn says, are the overwhelming majority of marriages: unions that can, with grit and perseverance, not only endure but prosper. <p>
Encouraging lasting commitment in a society that seeks instant gratification is no small challenge. But if it is true that people tend to do those things that are most apt to earn them a good reputation, then it follows that deliberate efforts to valorize marital toughness and perseverance are needed in everything from high-school textbooks to Hollywood movie scripts. At the very least, such efforts could help counterbalance existing cultural messages that undercut marital permanence and stability.<p>
Efforts to valorize enduring commitment should be particularly targeted at men, who historically have shown a greater propensity to neglect family responsibilities than have women. Turning the hearts of men to their families may do more to address divorce (and many other social problems) than any other proposed remedy. On this front, the most encouraging signs on the cultural landscape are the emergence of groups urging men to see that self-sacrifice is a defining characteristic of authentic masculinity. The National Fatherhood Initiative is devising strategies to restore the importance of fathers in society's thinking about family and community life. The National Center for Fathering helps provide dads with practical childrearing skills. The Promise Keepers movement challenges men to make and keep a set of pledges to their wives and families. This year, more than 600,000 men are expected to attend Promise Keepers conferences and seminars.<p>
Given the tenuous state of marriage in America—and the tragic consequences of divorce on kids like Kurt Cobain—one should hope that these efforts succeed. America desperately needs more men to commit themselves to their wives in the way that Theodore Roosevelt once did. On the day that his wife accepted his marriage proposal, Roosevelt wrote in his journal: "The aim of my whole life shall be to make her happy and to shield her and guard her from trial, and, oh, how I shall cherish my sweet queen. How she, so pure and sweet and beautiful can think of marrying me, I cannot understand, but I praise and thank God it is so."

<p>
After presidential candidate Bill Clinton vowed to make abortion "safe, legal, and rare," President Clinton and his administration devised a somewhat bizarre strategy to help accomplish that goal. Within days of assuming office, the president signed four executive orders addressing abortion: He lifted the ban on fetal tissue research; he ended the ban on abortion counseling in federally funded clinics; he began a process to approve the abortion pill RU 486; and he revoked the prohibition against abortions in military hospitals overseas. All these policies would seem to increase the accessibility and likelihood of abortion.<p>
Even so, it is remarkable that abortion does seem to be slightly rarer. The total number of abortions in America dropped by 80,000 in 1992, hitting its lowest level since 1979. Abortion rates, declining for more than a decade, dropped again, to under 26 per 1,000 women of child-bearing age. There was a decrease as well in the percentage of pregnancies ending in abortion, from a high of about 30 percent in 1983-85 to less than 27.5 percent in 1992. For the first time since Roe v. Wade—the Supreme Court ruling that repealed every state law restricting abortion—we have seen significant declines in all three categories for measuring abortion in America. And, though statistics aren't yet available, abortion providers expect to see lower numbers for 1993 and 1994.<p>
Why? <p>
The evidence for a decline in abortion is, admittedly, incomplete. Many states don't collect the sort of data required to draw solid conclusions—such as precise, annual figures for abortions, teen pregnancies, and illegitimate births. And whatever the decline in abortion, the descent has not been terribly steep. From 1980 to 1990, the annual figure wobbled between 1.55 million and 1.61 million. Though abortions performed in 1992 dropped to 1.53 million, the figure represents only a 5 percent decline from its 1990 peak.<p>
There seem to be at least four reasons for this slight decline. Over the last several years, we have witnessed a social movement to encourage teenagers to postpone sexual relations until marriage, increased professionalism and sensitivity in the nation's pro-life pregnancy care centers, growth in state laws fostering a fully informed abortion decision, and a decline in the number of doctors who perform abortions.<p><center><b>Learning to Wait</b></center><p>
Until recently, the prevailing approach for reducing the level of abortion has been to encourage contraceptive use, while reserving abortion as a fall-back solution. The assumption of this approach is that it is impossible to reduce sexual activity among teens or adults outside of marriage. Advocates of this position hope there are fewer abortion clients because women are making more efficient use of contraceptives. According to Susan Tew of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the proportion of unplanned pregnancies actually increased in the 1980s, from 54 percent in 1982 to 56 percent in 1988, the latest year for which figures are available. Tew says that women who are "young, poor, unwed, and minority" are more likely to have abortions, less likely to find access to contraceptives, and to understand the relative risks and benefits of various methods. More recent survey data indicates that the use of oral contraceptives and condoms is increasing; the latter may be due to heightened awareness of the dangers of sexually transmitted diseases.<p>
However, part of the recent drop in abortions could be attributed more to a decline in teenage sexual activity than a rise in contraceptive use. Studies by the Centers for Disease Control have shown the proportion of sexually experienced highschoolers dropping: In 1989, 59 percent engaged in intercourse, in 1991 the figure was 54 percent, and in 1992 it dropped to 43 percent. A 1994 Roper Starch survey, conducted in association with the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States, found that only 36 percent of high schoolers said they had had sex. In the latter survey, many of those who had "done it" wished they hadn't: 62 percent of sexually experienced girls, and 54 percent of all experienced high schoolers, said they "should have waited." <p>
Confirmation of these sentiments is found in an Emory University survey that asked 1,000 sexually active young teen girls what topic they wanted more information about. Nearly 85 percent checked "How to say no without hurting the other person's feelings." The meaning of politeness has shifted in one generation from "nice girls don't" to "nice girls have to."<p>
Abstinence-education programs across the country have found that telling kids not to have sex is surprisingly successful. A Title XX performance evaluation found that, two years after the Sex Respect program, non-participants were twice as likely as participants to have gotten pregnant. When the Teen Aid program moved into a California junior-high school, 147 students were reported pregnant; two years later, only 20 girls were pregnant. At a Chicago middle school, each eighth-grade graduating class usually included some pregnant girls; but three years of Project Taking Charge yielded three classes with no pregnant graduates.<p>
One of the most unusual success stories is that of True Love Waits, a program begun by a Baptist youth pastor in Tennessee. It offers adolescents a chance to sign "pledge cards" vowing virginity until marriage. What sounds to hip and aging baby boomers like boring prudery was seized by teenagers with an eagerness their parents had reserved for hula hoops. In one year, 500,000 cards were signed, and the program has spread across 26 denominations, Catholic and Protestant. Last July, 20,000 kids staked 200,000 of the cards on the Washington Mall, and spent the day dancing and picknicking. President Clinton came by for a few minutes to join them.<p><center><b>Rising Moral Concerns</center></b>
<p>
A rise in youthful morality about sex outside marriage is paralleled by moral concerns about abortion. A recent CBS/New York Times poll found that, while 46 percent of respondents said that abortion is murder, the age group most likely to voice that opinion was 18 to 29. In 1990, a series of focus groups was conducted by researchers for the Center for Population Options, exploring teens' attitudes toward abortion. To the authors' evident dismay, "In response to the question, 'What first comes into your head when you hear the word "abortion"?' participants—regardless of race, sex, or residence—most often responded with 'murder,' 'killing a baby' or 'death.'…In general, the female participants were especially judgmental of other women's motives—in some cases not even sanctioning abortion in the case of rape. Comments focused on the 'innocence' of the baby, regardless of the circumstances."<p>
The growing concern about the "innocence" of the baby has not yet led to a change in attitudes about the legality of abortion. For example, a periodic NBC/Wall Street Journal poll asks, "Do you think abortion should be illegal, or not?" In eight surveys between 1989 and 1993, those responding "illegal" wavered from 33 percent to 26 percent and back up to 35 percent, a wobbly but fairly consistent response. Nor does a conviction that abortion is wrong necessarily insure that the respondent would refuse to have one. While researching for my book, Real Choices, I interviewed women across the country who had had abortions, and found several who had been pro-life, committed Christians at the time. They fully believed that in choosing abortion they were killing their babies. A common coping mechanism was, "God, I'll send this baby back to you now, and when I'm ready you send it back to me." Anti-abortion opinions did not prevent them from having abortions when their situations felt overwhelmingly difficult.<p>
The goal of my research project was to discover why women had abortions, in hopes that we could reduce the numbers by solving pregnancy problems. Like the Guttmacher Institute and other researchers' studies, I found that women usually have several interconnecting reasons for their abortions, involving job, school, finances, present concerns, and fears for the future. However, when I asked women to recount the story of their abortion decision, one factor emerged as determinative nearly every time: problems in personal relationships. Almost 90 percent of the women surveyed said the main reason for the abortion was to please or protect some other person, usually a partner or parents. When asked, "What would you have needed to continue the pregnancy?" the answer was consistent and emphatic: "Just one person. If I'd had only one person to stand by me, I would have had my baby."<p><b><center>Compassion and Persuasion</b></center><p>
The pregnancy-care wing of the pro-life movement has been trying to provide that personal support and friendship for 30 years, with increasing professionalism and success. This care usually shows up in the form of pregnancy-care centers, humble storefront operations scattered across the land, where material and emotional support is given to women free. These centers are usually run on a shoestring—many have no paid staff—and they can only give what others donate, from maternity clothes and diapers to housing, job training, medical care, and advice on adoption and parenting. <p>
In these pages a few years ago ("Victorian Secret," Spring 1992), Marvin Olasky suggested that aid to pregnant women was more effective than legal prohibitions in reducing abortion rates in the 19th century. Are advances in the provision of pregnancy support an element in the reduced number of abortions? "There just isn't enough information there to say, one way or the other," Olasky says. "But certainly the pregnancy-care movement has been tremendously effective in keeping the numbers as low as they are. Without pro-lifers offering support and shelter to pregnant women over the years, the abortion toll would have been far higher."<p>
Some pregnancy-care centers are independent operations, while others affiliate with national chains. The two largest chains are Birthright and Care Net, which together represent about 1,000 centers. In these chains and elsewhere, the last few years have seen a shift toward a philosophy sometimes summarized in the slogan, "Love them both." Pam Stearns, director of the Hope Unlimited Pregnancy Care Center in Paducah, Kentucky, says, "Before, we had pictures of aborted fetuses right in the lobby—we had an aggressive agenda of saving the baby. Now the focus has been enlarged, and our mission is to serve the client. Everything is done to make her feel comfortable, not used and manipulated." Today, a visitor to the Paducah center will see landscapes and flowers in the lobby, and be greeted by a volunteer who listens carefully to her needs and fears.<p>
A unexpected phenomenon that may be implicated in the drop in abortion rates is being observed at these pregnancy-care centers: an increased demand for grief counseling, for men as well as women. Several pregnancy center directors say that this is becoming their fastest-expanding area of service. Staff at a center in South Carolina report, for example, that while they usually start one grief group per month, in January they had to start three, plus their first men's group. <p>
For many years, abortion mourning had no outlet; as one Real Choices interviewee, Bette, put it, pro-choice friends needed her to continue affirming her decision, and she feared revealing to pro-lifers that "I did what you despise." Now, as women find the freedom to tell their friends about their heartbreak, it may become a form of negative word-of-mouth advertising that could cause others to avoid abortion. In theory, both pro-life and pro-choice forces have an interest in helping women make the best resolution they can, but Bette goes on, "I was surprised at the way [pro-life] people accepted me. They were able to recognize and validate my pain. The pro-choice side can't do that—they have too much need to pretend that it isn't there."<p><center><b>Legislating for Life</b></center><p>
State laws to encourage informed decisions about abortion have multiplied in recent years and seem to have achieved some results. Nineteen states require that clinics provide information on the development of the baby, as well as the risks of and alternatives to abortion; 11 require women to wait 24 hours for "reflection"; 24 states require a parent to be involved before a teen's abortion.<p>
It should be noted that none of these laws actually places restrictions on abortion. No one is prevented from having the procedure. The Supreme Court's stipulation in the Casey decision of 1992 was that such laws were valid only if abortion was still permitted in all situations, with no "undue burden" placed on the freedom to abort. If women are declining abortion because more information and time to think have increased their awareness of alternatives, that is an expansion of choice, not a restriction. No one's business has been inhibited. Big-city yellow pages still run display ads by providers offering to end pregnancies up through the 24th week, with specialists available around the country to perform them later on request.<p>
In 1991, the American Journal of Public Health published an article examining the effect of a parental-notification law in Minnesota. During the four years the law was in effect, the abortion rate for minors fell dramatically—27 percent—while the birth rate continued to fall in accord with a long-term trend. Overall, teen pregnancy was down 21 percent. The hopeful conclusion is that the law did not merely stop abortions, but caused teens to be more careful about preventing pregnancy. According to the report, "Positive claims about these laws are that they promote responsibility (by encouraging teenagers to 'think before they act'), foster parent-child communication, facilitate mature decision making, and may reveal medical history information that would otherwise remain unknown to the physician."<p><b><center>Market Realities</b></center><p>
Another explanation for the decline in abortions is that fewer doctors will perform the procedure. Between 1985 and 1988, there were an average of 33 fewer abortion providers every year; by the 1988 to 1992 period, the yearly loss had accelerated to 51. Part of this loss is due to the "graying of abortion providers," as the average age of a provider slips above the average age of physicians, and retirement claims an increasing proportion. Some doctors leave the field because of harassment or fear of violence; the increased cost of security is one reason the average price of an abortion rose from $250 in 1988 to $300 in 1992.<p>
Why aren't younger doctors entering the field?<p>
To an idealistic young doctor, abortion has little appeal—it's fundamentally a destructive operation, offering little professional challenge, and no ongoing doctor-patient relationship. In addition, other doctors hold abortion providers in low esteem. Warren Hern, an abortion specialist in Boulder, Colorado, complains that his fellow providers "are treated as a pariah by the medical community. At best, we are tolerated." In 1993, the controversial Project Choice survey (staged by pro-life activists under a sympathetic-sounding name) polled almost a thousand abortion providers; 69 percent said their profession was "not respected in the medical community" and 78 percent said that they did not feel "pro-choice organizations and politicians are doing enough to support those who provide abortion care." <p>
A better question is, in the face of these discouragements, why did older doctors join the field? Thirty years ago, doctors were still seeing women come into emergency rooms injured by self-abortion or illegal abortion, and it was possible to see the provision of legal abortion as a noble, lifesaving act. Seventy-one percent of the Project Choice respondents had "personally [seen] a tragedy as a result of an illegal abortion," another subtle indication of their age. Younger doctors have not had that galvanizing experience. On the other hand, they have had experience with more recent medical advances: sonograms and fetoscopy, fetal surgery, and the rescuing of ever-younger preemies. All of these make indelibly visible what abortion—legal or illegal—destroys. Likewise, it was easier to feel positive about delivering abortions when only a few desperate cases were envisioned; the routine toll of 1.5 million a year sours everybody. <p>
Abortion provision is a specialty that is not intrinsically rewarding, is held in low esteem by the public and medical colleagues alike, and exposes one to the risk of hatred or even violence from protesters. When an aspiring doctor thinks, "What do I want to be?" a great many other options will come to mind before this. <p>
The dwindling ranks of abortion providers seem to be helping to bring down the abortion rates in some states. Nationally, there are about four providers per 100,000 women of reproductive age. In Hawaii, where the relative number of providers is 19.6, the abortion rate is the second highest in the country. In states such as Kentucky and Missouri, with fewer than 1.5 providers, the abortion rate hovers between one fourth and one half the national average.<p>
If there are fewer abortion providers available, would women, in large numbers, resort to self-inflicted abortions? Or would they simply cross state lines to have abortions elsewhere? The answers are no and perhaps. Though the number of providers has already dropped, there is simply no evidence that illegal abortion has returned. It may be that illegal abortion has been so thoroughly discredited that no woman wants to risk it.<p>
Some travel would undoubtedly occur: In 1987, more Wyoming women had abortions out-of-state than in-state. (In Cheyenne, the state's largest city, no abortions were performed in 1992.) On the other hand, abortion rates tend to be higher for poor non-white or Hispanic women, who are less likely to have the resources to travel. Then again, they are more likely to live in metropolitan areas where providers already cluster (94 percent of non-metropolitan areas now have no provider). Making state-by-state predictions is maddeningly uncertain, however. Between 1988 and 1992, North Dakota went from three providers to one, and the abortion rate dropped 28 percent. South Dakota remained steady with only one provider, and the rate rose 19 percent.<p><b><center>The Age Factor</b></center><p>
A final consideration of the drop in abortions involves age: As the baby boomers get older, the cohort of women of reproductive age (15 to 44) is weighted more heavily toward the end, where fewer pregnancies occur. Since two thirds of all abortions are performed on women under 25, the abortion rate should drop when the size of that group shrinks. The decline in the ranks of females age 15 to 22 from 1988 to 1992 could account for one-sixth of the decline in abortions over this period.<p>
Among the uncertainties regarding the abortion decline, one unhappy certainty looms: A great many more women are choosing single parenting. In 1981, births to unwed mothers occurred at the rate of 30 per 1,000 women of childbearing age, rising to 39 by 1988 and 45 by 1991. Pregnancy-care centers report that most of their unwed clients who choose birth opt for single parenting, while only a tiny number choose adoption. Amid a growing social consensus that unwed parenting damages both mother and child, these statistics are discouraging. Prochoice advocates may think that abortion would have been a better choice; pro-lifers would rather see these children born than aborted, but would prefer their moms either marry or place the child for adoption. Both sides agree that prevention is better than cure.<p>
The drop in abortion numbers in 1992 is a tantalizingly cryptic event. Analyzing it is like trying to follow the action of a play with the curtain risen only far enough to show the actors' ankles. No one on any side in this debate, much less the confused folks in the middle, can predict what will happen next. But a scrap of information like this does tantalize, because the abortion issue reverberates with meanings beyond itself. Abortion asks us big questions about "Life, the Universe, and Everything." It asks ultimate questions like, "Who belongs in our human family?" "Who may kill?" and "When does life begin?"<p>
For the last question, at least, there is an answer. It is 23. Life begins at 23 pairs of chromosomes—or, for those with Down's syndrome, 23 pairs plus one. Unless that number were somehow repealed, it matters little whether the other numbers are a million-point-five or a million-point-six. It's still more than 4,000 every day, more than 31 million since Roe v. Wade; it's still a number that prods our weary consciences, a little more sternly every day.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT></B>ashington is a city of monuments. Its grandest and most expensive is a work 
still in progress, but nearing completion: the District of Columbia itself, which 
commemorates the ruin of American liberalism.</P>
<P>	The D.C. government is bankrupt today because liberal policies have decimated 
its tax base. Washington is a hollow community of extreme rich and poor. Landlords and 
private employers have fled by the thousands, followed by nearly the entire middle class 
of taxpayers. Although Washington is the center of one of the most dynamic information-
based economies in the U.S, it has a declining population and a growing number of 
people below the poverty line. This year, twice as many households as in 1988 lack 
phones. In no other laboratory of democracy has the liberal experiment taken such pure 
form. Nowhere else have the results been so damning. </P>
<P>	The District is perhaps the most liberal city in America. Nine of every 10 
registered voters are Democrats, and the Socialist Workers Party fields more candidates 
for local office than the Republican Party. Conceived at the high tide of American 
liberalism, the District government is a product of its times, more concerned with the 
rights of groups than with the responsibilities of individuals. Many of the original office 
holders, political activists with no experience in private enterprise, are still in power 
today. The results are tragic. Among all U.S. states, the District has the highest per-capita 
murder and violent-crime rates, the highest percentage of residents on public assistance, 
the highest-paid school board, the lowest SAT scores, and the most single-parent 
families.</P> 
<P>	The political activists have built a government they can't afford. Although the city 
takes in an astounding $8,950 in revenue for every man, woman, and child in its 
jurisdiction (compared with $4,100 and $3,700 in nearby Maryland and Virginia, 
respectively), the District still manages to spend $1,000 more per person than it receives. 
The result is a budget deficit edging closer to $1 billion with each new audit. </P>
<P>	The victims of this ferociously progressive government are not the wealthy and 
privileged, but the middle class and beleaguered. Today, in some parts of the city, it 
seems entire neighborhoods are for sale. In places like Shepherd Park, Lincoln Park, 
Marshall Heights--communities once redolent of African-American pride and history--
there are lonely streets whose only splash of color appears on the real-estate signs that 
seem to sprout from every other garden plot. </P>
<P>	At the end of one of these streets stands the Florida Avenue Grill. From behind 
the counter of the often-crowded restaurant, Lacey Wilson Jr. has seen the District of 
Columbia ebb and flow. These days, it's mostly ebbing. Back in 1944, when Wilson's 
father opened his soul-food restaurant on the corner of Florida Avenue and 11th Street, 
near the LeDroit Park section of Northwest Washington, the city was a thriving 
community of educated descendants of freed slaves, flourishing family businesses, and 
urban sophistication. It was also a magnet of opportunity for blacks seeking to escape 
rural poverty. At mid-century, wartime Washington offered stable, well-paying white-
collar jobs in the federal bureaucracy. People came and put down roots. </P>
<P>	Eighteen years ago, when Lacey Wilson Jr. began working at the Grill full time, 
the neighborhood brimmed with well-kept houses and children playing. Today, the Grill 
stands alone in an otherwise vacant lot. In the short time since the District was granted 
home rule in 1974, Washington has gone from promised land to no-man's-land. "Most of 
the families who lived here have moved out to Maryland," says Wilson, himself a refugee 
to "the peace and quiet" of suburban Virginia. Those who stayed in the neighborhood, 
according to Wilson, are trapped in houses that have lost 30 percent of their value in the 
last eight years. </P>
<P>	Business used to be better, says Wilson. The vacant lot next door means more 
taxicabs can park at lunch time, but the crime that holds this city hostage each night has 
cut his after-dark dinner traffic by half. Proud of his restaurant's permanence in a 
turbulent world, Wilson stands below rows of signed photos of his famous patrons--
athletes, musicians, and local politicians, including a young Marion Barry glowing with 
promise before dissipation hardened his face and tarnished his reputation as a can-do 
mayor.</P>
<P>	Wilson and his patrons are concerned that Washington, once the incubator of 
America's black middle class, is now a place from which to escape. After reaching a peak 
population of 800,000, the city has withered to just 578,000 last year, and the trend has 
accelerated. Ten thousand residents desert the city each year. Even worse news is who is 
leaving: the homeowners, the entrepreneurs, the role models--in short, the black middle 
class. They are leaving for the suburbs, and with every defector, D.C. loses a taxpayer, 
which shrinks the tax base available for feeding a voracious welfare state that causes 
more frustrated residents to leave, and on and on.</P>
<P>	Census figures reveal that during the second half of the 1980s, 157,100 residents, 
or one-fifth of the entire population, moved out of the District. About half of those 
emigrants moved to Maryland and 12 percent to Virginia. According to the Greater 
Washington Research Center, black households earning between $30,000 and $50,000 a 
year made up a disproportionate number of these refugees. In their place, affluent, single 
whites are moving into the city, but not enough to offset the loss. The result is a city 
rapidly dividing into segregated communities of economic extremes.</P>
<P>	Ask people at the Florida Street Grill about middle-class flight, and they'll tell 
you it is the little things that make life difficult in the District. Thomas Jones, finishing up 
his lunch before driving back to his job in Virginia, says it costs too much to live in the 
city. "Not just money," he says, "but time and aggravation." The Grill attracts an 
unusually diverse crowd for Washington, but there is agreement on one point: The 
government is no longer a neutral referee for self-sufficient citizens, but a muscular 
competitor against private enterprise. "For all the forms I need to fill out and all the 
inspections I'd have to have--and I'm not even talking about the fees and taxes," says 
one would-be entrepreneur, "why should I do business here? They've got open arms in 
Maryland. They make it easy there." A discussion soon erupts over the merits of 
suburban life, including such "innovations" as drive-through car registration, a one-stop 
business office where permits and licenses are issued, and same-day street repairs. The 
District, on the other hand, offers a notoriously slow motor-vehicles department, a 
bureaucracy suspicious of any profitable endeavor, and patchwork streets that haven't 
seen new asphalt in years. </P>
<P>	Wilson, Jones, and a number of other patrons own at least one rental unit in the 
city--often the place they used to live in. Thanks to the city government, these units are a 
steadier source of frustration than of income. The District has some of the most stringent 
rent-control and tenant's-rights provisions in the nation, but instead of helping 
disadvantaged renters, the laws tend to discourage rental activity. "It's not worth it to rent 
out your property," says Jones. He tells a harrowing story of a tenant who exploited all 
the rules to live, rent-free, for more than 16 months. "She had me in court. Never paid me 
anything, and she had the nerve to sue me!" Wilson and others at the counter nod 
knowingly. "I'll never rent out again," Jones declares. "After getting it up to code, what 
with rent control, it takes you 20 years to get your money back."</P>
<P>	Behind the cash register at the Florida Avenue Grill stands Edgar Featherson, a 
native Washingtonian with a quiet, genteel grace that reminds you of the once courtly 
city. After the lunch crowd dwindles, Featherson drives home through the LeDroit Park 
neighborhood in the early afternoon. The sidewalks overflow with students from the four 
public schools in the area. The children are a concern to Featherson.</P>
<P>	"They don't have the kind of family I was blessed with," he says. He is proud of 
his education, much of it the result of lessons his mother drilled into him years ago. The 
world has changed dramatically since then. He tells a story of the time he prepared dinner 
for his nephew and a friend from the neighborhood. "This boy had never seen anything 
like it. I made them put their coats away and wash their hands before we sat down," he 
recalls. "By the end of the night, you know that boy would not leave the house? He never 
had anyone telling him how to act, never had anyone treat him like a normal child." With 
a mixture of disgust and guilt, Featherson shakes his head. "This boy was so starved for 
love, he wouldn't leave." </P>
<P>	Featherson's nephew doesn't go to public school. He attends Archbishop Carroll 
High School in another part of town, partly because parents there are more involved in 
their children's education than they are in D.C. public schools. "If you don't show up at a 
parent-teacher meeting at Carroll, you get fined," he says. "They'd never try that in 
public school." To Featherson, public education is a mechanism for downward mobility, 
not a ladder out of poverty. "Look at Franklin Smith [the Superintendent of D.C. Public 
Schools]. He sends his kids to private school. He has a choice and he doesn't even send 
his own children to public school. Now what does that say about D.C. schools?" </P>
<P>	He mentions a news item from the Washington Times, reporting that in the 
seventh-grade "intensive" English class at one of the city's elite junior-high schools, not a 
single book was assigned to the class during the entire year. "And that's in the best 
schools," he says. "You can imagine what they're like in the rest of the city."</P>
<P>	John Robinson, another Grill customer, founded Black Diamond Industries in 
1976 to manufacture stainless-steel kitchen equipment for McDonald's and Wendy's 
restaurants. He exudes a world-weary optimism. His office is decorated with a yellowed 
picture of Jackie Robinson and a framed portrait of his mother. Robinson has not left the 
city yet. "This is where I live, my family is here, my church is here," he says. Still, the 
thought crosses his mind often.</P>
<P>	"Paperwork is my Achilles' heel," says Robinson. "With 20 employees, if I have 
one person doing nothing but government paperwork, non-income producing paperwork, 
then I've got 5 percent of my work force doing useless stuff." Robinson complains that 
he is a good employer in a city that needs private-sector job creation, yet the city ignores 
his needs. </P>
<P>	"The D.C. government doesn't care about my business--they don't see us we're 
so small--but it's businesses like this, with under 50 people, that are the real job 
producers," Robinson says. Washington has become something of a private-sector jobs 
vacuum. Job creation since 1980 has been anemic: 7 percent growth in employment, 
compared with 40 percent in suburban Maryland and 94 percent in suburban Virginia. 
Had D.C. managed to create jobs at the national average, it would have generated 80,000 
more jobs between 1980 and 1993.</P>
<P>	"Small business is about family and the community," says Robinson. "I work 
here. I live in the city. I hire people from the neighborhood. The government should be 
encouraging me, not just some big corporation. When I complain to the city government, 
they say `What's the problem? Every other business can do it. Why can't you?' But I'm 
not Marriott, I'm not MCI. I can't wait six weeks for an inspection or a permit. I'm out of 
business in six weeks. I could do about $100,000 more business a year if I didn't have so 
much paperwork," says Robinson.</P>
<P>	The solution to the worst of his problems is simple, Robinson says. "The city 
should announce tomorrow, `If you've got less than 50 employees, you don't need a 
license, you don't need a permit, all you have to do is pay taxes on time.' Just let me go 
to work. Nothing would make my life easier than that."</P>
<P>   If you drive along Minnesota Avenue in Anacostia, you'll see few private businesses. 
Many of the small outposts of enterprise are liquor stores, and likely owned by Korean-
born entrepreneurs. Douglas Kim, a small-businessman and head of the Korean-American 
Chamber of Commerce, says that nearly a third of all business licenses in the District of 
Columbia are held by low-capital Korean merchants. Recent immigrants often start up in 
the more hostile parts of the District. The risks may be higher, but the initial investment 
required is small compared to the more affluent suburbs. "After six or seven years," says 
Kim, "they move their business out of the city." Surveys show that 96 percent of all 
Koreans who own businesses in the District already live in the suburbs. </P>
<P>	Koreans are torn between the city and the suburbs, Kim says. The crime rate 
disturbs them. A recent survey showed that 89 percent of Korean merchants felt the 
police were "untrustworthy" or "very untrustworthy." But the biggest obstacle to a 
thriving Korean community in D.C. is the public-school system. "We come here for a 
better life for our children," says Kim, who lives in Virginia so his children can attend 
public schools there. "You know, it's the American dream." Kim's wife, who immigrated 
more recently, is still uncomfortable with the anonymity of the suburbs. "When my boys 
graduate," he says, "we'll move back to the city, but not now. --If there were excellent 
public schools in the District like there are in Virginia, all the Koreans would be living in 
the city tomorrow!"</P>
<P>	Many of the D.C. refugees are doubtless fleeing crime and the city government's 
inability to protect them from it. Don Scoggins, a refugee himself, is a real-estate broker 
who has helped hundreds flee bleeding neighborhoods. "Crime is more devastating to 
these communities than racism or Jim Crow ever was," says Scoggins, "but the city 
officials still think they're leading the civil-rights movement. They'd rather talk about the 
`root causes of crime' instead of locking up the criminals."</P>
<P>	To Scoggins, a black government worker-turned-entrepreneur, the story is 
depressingly routine. "The people running D.C. are more concerned with the people who 
can't take care of themselves," he says, "at the expense of the rest of us, the ones who 
have made an investment in the city's future." </P>
<P>	Joe Corey is a restaurateur in the upscale Glover Park section of Northwest D.C. 
Though his business required a large initial investment, he's not so different from the 
Korean merchants across town. When he had a chance to expand his business, he chose to 
open a restaurant in Virginia instead of D.C. "The taxes are too high, the bureaucracy is a 
mess," he says. "I told [former city council chairman] John Wilson on a radio call-in 
show that I wanted to stay in the city, but I couldn't afford the time and effort. You know 
what he told me? `Don't let the door hit you on the way out.' Is that anyway to treat a 
taxpayer?"</P>
<P>	It's the small things that make Corey think of leaving town--like the city's 
passion for writing parking tickets. Most residents will agree that the one thing the 
government does with breathtaking efficiency is issue tickets. "To them it's another 
source of income, so sure they write as many as they can, whether they're valid or not," 
says Corey. Since there's revenue at stake, the city for once turns to the lowest-cost 
provider, a private corporation called Lockheed Information Management. "The city is so 
shortsighted," says Corey. "They ticket my customers so they can raise a couple of 
hundred dollars in revenue, and they drive the customers away. They don't think of the 
business I'm doing and the taxes I'm paying. My business is worth much more to them in 
the long run than the few bucks they'll get from parking tickets." </P>
<P>   Corey perceives a hostile climate for business in the District. "They neglect you if 
you're a taxpaying business," he says. "When I call the city government, I can never get 
the right person on the phone or the right answer to a question. I can call down there on a 
Wednesday afternoon and no one answers the phone at all. But if I lose an employee, that 
guy gets unemployment benefits the next day, and God help me if I make a mistake with 
unemployment insurance. They're all over me." Corey speculates that career city 
employees are suspicious of anyone making money. "In this city, non-taxpayers are more 
privileged than the ones who are paying the taxes." As a result, many businessmen have 
fled the District, leaving behind an anemic economy in which the Washington Post and 
McDonald's are two of the largest private employers.</P>
<P>	For the Washingtonians who have invested their lives in District neighborhoods, 
there is sometimes no escape. Benjamin Thomas has lived in Benning Heights since 
1958. "It's a nice neighborhood, good working people," he says, but for five years the 
community has been besieged by drug dealers and the murderous outgrowth of their 
trade. "We're overrun by crime. I heard gunshots just last night and no one will respond." 
The breakdown of law and order is almost total. "We've got cars driving around here 
with no license plates, never been inspected, parked anywhere they come to a stop." 
Overwhelmed by violent crime, the police don't bother to enforce the basic laws that 
protect a neighborhood from chaos. "We're completely surrounded here," says Thomas. 
His home is now on a hostile frontier, and he sees little chance to escape. "Where can I 
go? Even if I find somebody who wants to buy my house, I won't have enough money 
even for a down payment anywhere else."</P>
<P>	Thomas places the blame squarely on the city government. "I've written letters to 
the mayor, to the city council, but no one ever answers. We're on our own out here." 
Thomas recalls the city was unresponsive even before the neighborhood disintegrated. "I 
fought 10 years to get a traffic light on Benning Road [a major point of entry to the city], 
and I never heard a thing from downtown."</P>
<P>	As Ray Dickey sees it, the transformation from neighborhood to no-man's-land 
begins at home. Dickey says he was the first black to move into the North Michigan Park 
neighborhood, back in 1957. "It starts when parents don't spend time with their kids, and 
don't let their children's friends in the house." The children eventually get the message 
that they're on their own, and they grow up not caring about anyone but themselves. 
"Neighbors don't even talk to each other anymore," says Dickey. "Now I live in a 
neighborhood of strangers. It's sad."</P>
<P>	North Michigan Park suffers from a disorder that no amount of government 
largess can remedy. "It's not about money," he says. "Money won't fix it. Government 
can't bring these people together and make them care." Dickey looks for non-government 
institutions to help bridge the gap, but finds them badly weakened by middle-class flight. 
"There are 10 churches in this neighborhood," says Dickey, "but they're not part of the 
neighborhood anymore. The people coming to church are all from the suburbs. They 
come on Sunday for an hour, then leave. The rest of the week, the doors are locked."</P>
<P>	A government's main mission is to ensure the safety of its citizens. Yet in the 
middle-class neighborhoods of Ward 6, the police presence has been cut back just when 
the neighborhood needs it the most. "I'm trapped in my own home," says Sheila Stamps, 
a widowed mother of five living in public housing on Capitol Hill. "You can't let 
children out by themselves, and the playground is littered with intravenous needles." 
Marion Barry, the newly elected mayor, recently threatened to withdraw the police from 
Ward 6 unless its city-council representative supported a controversial tax increase. This 
news brings Stamps to a boil. "You can't touch the police and the fire department. That's 
public safety. You can't touch that and expect people to stay here much longer."</P>
<P>	Stamps knows what's wrong with her city and what to do about it. "There are two 
things that must be there," she says. "Public safety and good schools." She wants the 
police to build a substation in her neighborhood so the same policemen can live and work 
in the area. "We need police here so they can live with the problem, so they'll know what 
it is like." Stamps also wants school choice. "Any child in this city should be able to go to 
the best schools," she says. "If they meet the criteria, let them go." She says the 
politicians and the media people who live in affluent Ward 3 don't want poor black 
children in their schools. "The president can send his child to any school he wants." she 
says. All she wants is the same opportunity. "We've got a lot of smart kids down here, 
hard-working kids. But they don't get the chance."</P>
<P>	Based on the liberal premise that poor citizens will always be poor and affluent 
citizens will always be affluent, the District government is perplexed that middle-class 
citizens are seeking opportunity elsewhere. After hundreds of tax increases, the city's 
ledgers are soaked with red ink. Despite employing tens of thousands of civil servants, 
even basic services are abysmal. The solution parroted by city officials has always been 
to grant statehood to the District. The reality is that the city government has squandered 
what sovereignty it has. More than 50 of the city's agencies are under court control, and 
the District owes $21 million in contempt-of-court fees due to its mishandling of its 
limited responsibilities. </P>
<P>	There can be no solution to the District's problems until the flight of middle-class 
families is stanched and reversed. That will require the District government to compete 
with its suburbs to provide the basic services middle-class taxpayers expect. The city can 
attract new residents by emphasizing public safety and quality public education, and by 
providing a competitive regulatory climate for entrepreneurs and a low-capital point of 
entry to the economy. Projects and services that do not add to the appeal of Washington 
as a place to raise a family can no longer be justified. The city must close the law school 
of the University of the District of Columbia, which produces no lawyers, privatize the 
appalling D.C. General Hospital, and lower its tax rates to compete with those of 
surrounding jurisdictions. </P>
<P>	The solution is hardly draconian. Other cities take great pride in performing the 
basics efficiently. Washington has the advantage of being the kind of city many people 
would like to live in. But it must first shed its Great Society heritage. The D.C. 
government has betrayed the very people it was intended to serve. True, it has succeeded 
in creating an integrated community where African-Americans can live in peace and 
thrive economically. Unfortunately, that community is just over the District line--in 
Maryland's Prince George's County.</P>
<P>	Why does Featherson stay in the District? "Well, it's like the Grill," he explains. 
"We've been here so long, for 50 years. I just hope there are some kids who walk by and 
think, `They've made it, they've been here through everything, they're proof you can 
make it if you work hard.' That's why I stay here. I want these kids to say `If Mr. 
Featherson can make it, maybe I can too.'"</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT></B>he most popular outdoor basketball court in New York City is half the regulation 
size, offers no place to sit, and has sidelines bounded by a chain-link fence 20 feet high. 
Those who play here are literally encaged. Yet this ridiculously inadequate court, on 
West 4th Street in the heart of Greenwich Village, has drawn the likes of Denzel 
Washington and Julius Erving for pickup games. And the summer league based here is 
probably the most prestigious in the city. Each year, the West 4th Street League attracts 
more than 30,000 spectators--city-dwellers and tourists--who stand in blistering heat 
just to glimpse their favorite players and snap up league T-shirts at $12 apiece.</P>
<P>	West 4th Street basketball owes its popularity to the inner-city leadership of its 
volunteer commissioner, a limousine driver named Kenny Graham. With little support 
from city hall or local civic groups, he has spent the last 18 summers building the league 
into a New York institution. Lloyd Daniels, Mario Ely, Anthony Mason, Rod Strickland, 
and Jason Williams honed their skills here before going on to N.B.A. careers, and some 
of them still show up during the off-season. Former pros like Detroit's Kelly Tripuka mix 
it up with high-school dropouts.</P>

<H3>Midday Basketball</H3>
<P>	West 4th Street has developed its share of stars, but this is not the league's true 
purpose. In an era of commercialized sports, it is important to understand the 
contributions of a community league composed primarily of players whose glory days are 
over--25- to 35-year-olds with talent and pride, but no N.B.A. contracts. The league and 
its fans cherish players the media overlook, while putting sports and sportsmanship back 
into the community. It is midnight basketball played in broad daylight and without 
government handouts.</P>
<P>	A recent documentary film called <I>Hoop Dreams</I> dramatizes the pathos of the 
nearly-great athlete. William, a high-school phenom from Chicago, ponders his future as 
a scholarship recruit. In the final moments of the film, William reflects on all the people 
who've asked him,  "Will you still remember me when you're a big star in the N.B.A.?," 
and says, "I should've asked them, `Will you still remember me if I'm not?'" Promising 
inner-city players are typically groomed from the age of 12 or so. This process has 
obscured the virtues of athletic competition and replaced them with illusions of easy 
wealth. For a lucky few, lucrative professional careers represent a materialistic triumph 
and escape from the neighborhood.Graham's league, on the other hand, showcases those 
who cannot escape, who must remain behind and make their community work.</P>
<P>	"I started working there refereeing league games for $10 a game," Graham recalls. 
"The next year the league was falling apart and no one wanted to take over, so I decided I 
would be commissioner."</P>
<P>	Founded in 1968, the league had struggled along for several years with only eight 
teams, unreliable funding, and a shortage of referees. Today, Graham runs the oldest 
summer-basketball program in New York City. There is a game every day of the week in 
June, July, and August, five on Saturdays and Sundays. Each year, more than 600 players 
altogether participate in the 24-team men's division, a women's division of six teams, and 
an eight-team division for boys 15 and under. Its prowess is known nationwide. Last year, 
the Summer Pro-League outdoor championship, sponsored by Nike and shown on ESPN, 
was won by the defending champions from New York. But that team, which defeated a 
Chicago squad in the finals by 30 points, had finished second at West 4th Street.</P>
<P>	Youth teams have come from as far away as Seattle and France to play in the 
preliminary games before the seniors begin, but collegiate players rarely play here 
because the league is not sanctioned by the N.C.A.A. In his youth division, Graham 
prefers to work with younger, pre-high-school players, because high-school-age youths 
are often spoiled and difficult to control.   "We have trouble getting teams with 
responsible adults to control the players," he says. "It can be very difficult to talk to them. 
Last summer, we had high-school-age girls' teams, and fighting became a problem. At 
age 13 to 14, the kids will listen."</P>
<P>	The tiny court must hold two referees and 10 quick and often large players, so 
personal fouls proliferate. That makes refereeing difficult. "No one wanted to come down 
there to ref because West 4th Street was very rough," Graham says. "The first year I was 
commissioner, we had only one incident, and I took a stand. The players knew right then 
that I would not walk away from a problem." Arizona Pearson, who has played in the 
league for 11 years and now directs its youth program, has watched Graham keep the 
peace. "Kenny gets in the middle," he says, "but you have to do that, you have to be in 
control. With Kenny, it takes a lot to get him upset. If there's shouting and threatening, 
people apologize afterward."</P>
<P>	The cramped conditions also make ball control extremely difficult. Passing lanes 
are limited, and it is much easier here than in the N.B.A. for a defensive player to 
abandon his man to attack the dribbler or the post-up man waiting to turn and shoot. At 
the same time, the New York style of playground basketball frowns upon the staid jump 
shot in favor of the driving lay-up, with its infinite possibilities for blind pass-offs or shot 
creation. These factors produce a game of ferocious strength, speed, and competitiveness. 
The discipline and control of this style amazes outsiders and accounts for the league's 
popularity.</P>
<P>	West 4th Street smoothes the transition for many of the 98 percent of New York's 
good collegiate players who do not make it to the pros. The close of a competitive career 
can prompt an emotional letdown and demoralize young men with leadership abilities. 
Tony Hargraves was the co-captain of Iona College's basketball team in 1984-85 and was 
named an Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press, but he could not get 
a professional contract. Now an operations manager at Bear Stearns with a home and 
family in the suburbs, he continues to play regularly in the cage. "Good players still have 
a desire to play against people at their own level," Hargraves explains, "and West 4th 
Street offers this." When N.B.A. players show up, regulars treat them with respect, but 
they also relish the chance to show up the pro athletes.</P>
<P>	"The small court makes you do all the right things," Hargraves explains. "It 
improves your game. This is a place where you cannot continue to make mistakes. 
Anthony Mason [a power forward with the New York Knicks] is a prime example. West 
4th Street defined his game. He learned he had to move much more quickly. He became 
one of the stronger players in the city, and now he's one of the stronger players in the 
N.B.A."</P>

<H3>Respect Without Fear</H3>
<P>	I first became drawn to these players in the early 1980s, when I saw in their 
character something missing in the bright young MBAs at our big Wall Street trading 
firm. I saw in young players like Tony Sherman (who still plays) and Mario Ely (who 
won a championship ring with the Houston Rockets last year) awe-inspiring toughness, 
masculinity, and personal pride. These players are courteous but not chatty, fearless but 
disciplined. The better players have grit and a capacity for physical exertion that, I fear, 
our increasingly computerized society seems to devalue.</P>
<P>	Pearson sees the role of competitive basketball in the city quite clearly: "Of 
course it is fun, you can work off frustrations. But it's really about getting respect. That's 
what living in the city is about, you know." At West 4th Street, that means being looked 
up to by others. It's not the same as the fashionable notion of "self-esteem," which is of 
little use on the streets.</P>
<P>   Kenny's idea of respect is not built on fear. "I'm not militant and I'm not a cult leader," 
he explains. "I want people to learn they gain respect if they give respect. That's the 
bottom line.... Often black organizations are poorly run, and I tell players, `When you 
carry on, you reinforce stereotypes. If you make us and the league look bad, we could 
wind up with no league--and then you would have no chance to showcase your talents, 
we want a mutual respect for peers.... And respect for a program and an organization.... 
You can teach respect. I do it by talking, by challenging a person mentally. People judge 
others by their behavior, and I tell people that in their actions they represent their 
heritage, their culture, their race. A lot of so-called black leaders won't challenge black 
people about their behavior. It's easier to tell them [their problem is] white people."</P>
<P>   Fans must arrive early to reserve a good spot at courtside. For big games--the playoffs 
or the all-star game--youngsters sit on the fence or hang from tree branches. Graham or 
one of the staff wits uses a bullhorn to announce the games, and their commentaries are 
humorous, improvisational performances.</P>
<P>	The league has become an integral part of the lives of its 600-plus participants. 
Most of the players do not live in the neighborhood. They come mainly from Brooklyn, 
Harlem, or the Bronx to the playground here because they like to play before the big 
crowds in the Village.</P>
<P>	Sid Jones, a Brooklynite who has been coaching winning teams for 15 years, is 
particularly attuned to the sense of community the league has developed. "Generally, 
people don't spend time getting to know each other, but at this park, you meet people," 
Jones says. "The people you meet may help you in other parts of your life. Kenny and the 
league have been bringing people together for years, and it's now a community. You 
wonder, why can't people get along like this outside of sports? --Just about every 
subway line stops here, so you get people from all walks of life. It's a real melting pot. 
Players will come here when they won't go everywhere else. And I'll tell you, when you 
win a big game down here, you don't want to go home."</P>
<P> 	The city government provides the league nothing except a permit to play. "They 
are not that concerned with us," Graham says, "because they see we are doing OK. They 
are worried about their own programs. Occasionally a mayor will come down here to help 
get some votes. ... But they are not here to help the league."</P>
<P>   Graham never passes the hat. He and a few of his staff were once granted the status of 
part-time employees by the New York City Parks Department, but that was discontinued 
years ago. Money to run the league now comes exclusively from entry fees--$500 per 
team--and corporate sponsors. The principal sponsor for the last two years has been Fila 
Inc., a sportswear manufacturer, which subsidizes uniforms and gives sneakers to each 
team. Since 1986, Nobody Beats the Wiz has provided television sets for the winners of 
the Most Valuable Player and Sportsmanship awards. The nearby McDonald's feeds the 
staff more than 500 free meals each summer. The maker of Olde English 800 malt liquor 
provides a scoreboard and money for trophies and shorts.</P>
<P>	None of the league's successes--its local following, corporate sponsorship, and 
national recognition--would be possible without its reputation for serious, disciplined 
basketball. So Graham insists upon high standards of behavior. A public league held in a 
public park draws all kinds, and no one can be refused admission, but Graham works hard 
to maintain the dignity of the league. Sometimes a player or fan will challenge this. "One 
day right after a game, a guy on one of the teams dropped his pants," he recalls. "I didn't 
think it was funny. I laced into him something fierce. I embarrassed him right on the spot. 
What he did was totally wrong." As commissioner, Graham's decisions are final. If a 
player starts fights or disgraces the league in any way, he is banned for the season.</P>
<P>	Graham is a gifted leader who embodies positive thinking--necessary for 
entrepreneurs, but rare among administrators. Graham also takes great pride in delivering 
what he promises. Once when the TV prizes were held up due to a clerical snafu, he 
didn't hesitate to cover the costs. (Eventually, he was reimbursed.)</P>
<P>	Graham's devotion to excellence and good manners filters throughout the 
neighborhood. Good-humored and charismatic, he can quickly summon dozens of helpers 
to do whatever is needed--keeping score or sweeping the court before games. 
Afterwards, they leave the whole area cleaner than before. In this way, even street people 
become part of the league culture. "We take all kinds," says Graham. "We're all human 
beings. Sometimes people will tell me to get rid of a guy who maybe has a drinking 
problem. I say, if a man has a problem and I can help him, I will. Everybody can't be on 
the level we'd like them to be. Some guys have gone through their whole lives being 
rejected, but I will help somebody who wants to be helped. I can deal with them."</P>

<H3>Creating an Identity</H3>
<P>	Graham is proud of the fact that the league plays a part in the lives of many 
players and staff, even those who do menial work. "Many guys down here are not part of 
anything but a joint or a bottle of wine," he says. "We give them an identity above that 
stuff." Graham, who shuns smoking and alcohol, does not allow even surreptitious 
drinking in the park during games. He has also been known to chase smokers away, even 
though smoking is legal. He feels it creates a bad atmosphere for the kids who come to 
watch. He often reminds players that they are "guests" in the neighborhood.</P>
<P>   Even those who never became professional grow as players and as individuals. One of 
these is Tony Sherman, one of the best players in the league never to enjoy a good prep 
career or go to college. "He used to live down there," says Hargraves. "Every day at 3 
o'clock he'd be there working on his game. He's now a great player, and he's done it 
without a good high school record or any college experience.--At the park he became 
popular and he gained respect. That's a big thing in New York City." Pearson agrees: 
"Sherman's grown a lot. He could have been a troublemaker, but he watches his mouth 
now."</P>
<P>	Graham says Sherman has gradually earned the recognition he craves for his 
talent. He has come to follow the example set by Graham and some of the older players, 
and takes defeats with dignity.</P> 
<P>   "Sherman was once the king of the park," says Graham. "Many guys respected him out 
of fear. Now he's older, he's got responsibilities. I think he's realized that people give 
him respect. It's an important difference."</P>
<P>   Last year, then-Governor Mario Cuomo inaugurated the New York State Midnight 
Basketball League at a celebrity function in uptown Manhattan. The governor told the 
out-of-school, out-of-work youngsters for whom the league was created that "we have 
not done well by you, [but] we'll try to make it up to you." This was not the spirit that 
made West 4th Street.  Graham is not driven by paternalism or guilt, nor even by 
altruism. Like his players, he is motivated instead by a need for personal recognition and 
respect from the players and the basketball community. "It's nice to have people say, `I'm 
glad you're back,'" he says. Players and staff alike seek the rewards that come with 
excellence, not charity. "I tell them you don't have to love me--but you should respect 
me."</P>
<P>	Graham believes that other communities can duplicate the success of West 4th 
Street. First, he says, "develop a following. Develop a symbol. Our symbol is West 4th 
Street, playing in a cage. Our shirts are known all over New York--every kid wants one." 
Second, "develop people with character. You've got to let people know that you don't 
have to be out there, you've got a job and other things in your life. They can't just do 
what they'd like to."</P>
<P>	Sociologists like to point out that chaos and disorder are common aspects of 
malfunctioning inner-city families. One of Graham's greatest talents is for organization: it 
is he, not some government agency, that provides continuity for these New Yorkers. The 
order originates within the community rather than being imposed from without. There are 
lots of Kenny Grahams in every community. If such leaders are encouraged, they will 
come.</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT></B>he alienation of African-American men from the churches of their communities 
is perhaps the single greatest tragedy facing black America. "While 75 percent of the 
mosque is male, 75 percent of the black church is female," laments Jawanza Kunjufu, 
author of <I>Adam Where Are You?: Why Most Black Men Don't Go to Church</I>. It wasn't 
always so: In earlier generations, black men were much more involved in the church, and 
their religious faith bolstered their commitment to families and neighborhoods. The most 
effective way to reduce black crime, and to strengthen black families, may be to return 
African-American men to their spiritual roots.</P>
<P>	A church in Baltimore that is itself returning to its roots is making great headway 
in its ministry to men. Bethel AME Church, founded in 1785, is the second-oldest church 
in the African Methodist Episcopal denomination and a venerable institution squarely in 
the black political mainstream. Bethel hosted much of the NAACP's national summit last 
year. Its pastor, Frank Madison Reid III, is the son and grandson of AME bishops, and his 
step-brother is Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke. Reid was educated at Yale University 
and Harvard Divinity School. A veteran of the civil-rights movement, he served later as 
pastor of Ward AME Church, an important congregation in Los Angeles. He has earned a 
black belt in karate, a prominent image as a local television personality, and a position as 
an intellectual leader of the African-American church.</P>

<H3>A Growing Concern</H3>
<P>	When Reid, 43, was named pastor of Bethel in 1989, the congregation had 7,000 
members, 25 percent of them men. Today, its membership numbers 10,000, 40 percent of 
whom are men. Each week, 4,400 of the faithful attend one of the two Sunday services, 
and 45 percent of them are men. Secular agencies and politicians who want to improve 
urban life should take note of Reid's ministry. Black men in his congregation have 
reconciled with their wives, resumed responsibilities to their children and communities, 
committed themselves to becoming productive citizens, and dedicated themselves to God.</P>
<P>	Rare among traditional black churches, economic classes mix at Bethel. The 
church is located in the Druid Hill section of Baltimore, a historically working-class 
neighborhood now infested with drugs and dilapidated public-housing projects, but it 
draws its membership from middle-class suburbs as well as the surrounding 
neighborhood. At services, blue-jean-clad youths pray while holding hands with middle-
aged professionals and families dressed in their Sunday best.</P> 
<P>	Reid attributes the growth of his congregation to a return to its Methodist roots. 
The Methodist movement, started by Charles and John Wesley in England in the 18th 
century, was spread throughout America by preachers such as George Whitefield. When 
Richard Allen and other blacks were barred from praying in a Methodist church in 
Philadelphia in the late 1700s, they established the AME church. Early Methodism 
emphasized moral rectitude and discipline, revivalism, the study of Scripture in Bible 
groups, and personal conversion. The movement played a leading role in the national 
crusades against drunkenness and slavery. "We meet the spiritual needs of the people 
because of our focus on prayer and the mystical nature of connection between the 
individual human being and the Holy Spirit," says Reid.</P>
<P>	Worship at Bethel is boisterous; dancing and shouting infuse the atmosphere. 
Reid sees this as a return to the spirit of early Methodism, when religious intensity 
energized powerful campaigns for the betterment of society. Reid points with pride to the 
18th-century English Methodists who "went into the prisons and streets with a revival 
that saved England from the same revolutionary fate as France." And he cites as a model 
the 1870s revival at Philadelphia's Bethel AME Church, which prompted a moral uplift 
in the city's black population.</P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men is in the early Methodist tradition of vigorous outreach to 
the unchurched, wherever they may be found. As the pastor of Ward AME in the early 
1980s, Reid concluded that the church wasn't addressing the needs of young men on the 
street. He also wondered why black males were joining the Nation of Islam or Los 
Angeles gangs like the Bloods and Crips, but not the Protestant churches. "Jesus said, `I 
will make you fishers of men,' " he says. "But either the church wasn't using the right 
bait or the lines weren't strong enough to bring the fish into the church."</P> 
<P>	How does Reid reel the men in at Bethel?  His television services encourage men 
to visit the church.  Highly approachable, he invites men to attend his church when he 
meets them on Baltimore's streets in his daily travels.  His use of the term "brother" 
suggests kinship and inspires male members to actively urge their friends to accompany 
them to Bethel.</P>  
<P>	Reid also uses a four-step plan that relies on "respect" for black males, teaching 
the "roots" of Christianity, "reformation" of habits, and "resurrection" of lives.  At 
Sunday services, male visitors are welcomed with applause and hugs. "We want to 
express our joy for your presence in the Lord's house," Reid says from the pulpit.</P>   
<P>	 Reid recently invited Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam to speak at Bethel. 
Reid disagrees with Farrakhan's theology and racial and religious separatism. But Reid 
wanted men who are attracted to Farrakhan to be exposed to a church that emphasizes 
Christian manliness.</P>
<P>	Men who visit Bethel also find an atmosphere that is masculine as well as 
feminine, unlike many of the churches they are used to. At age 13 or so, many black 
youths tend to drop out of church. "At that age, black males who were once drawn to the 
choir as youth no longer sing, because robes look like dresses," says Reid. "Their Sunday 
school teacher, superintendent, and youth adviser are women. Their reaction to the 
religious femininity of the church drives them out of the church and into the seduction of 
a gang."</P>
<P>	At Bethel, men as well as women occupy important board and teaching positions, 
and Reid makes sure that men won't have to leave the church to find opportunities for 
brotherhood. In addition to all-female Bible study and family Bible programs, Bethel 
offers weekly all-male Bible classes. There, stories from Scripture inspire men to talk 
freely about difficulties in their relations with women, and--Reid calls this a common 
problem among black men--the resentment they may feel toward absent, domineering, or 
abusive fathers.</P> 
<P>	Every November, Bethel hosts a month-long celebration of men. Last year's 
activities included a retreat, African martial-arts experts, scholarly lectures, a Men's Day 
with noted personalities like talk-show host Tony Brown, and a week-long revival service 
at which 67 men, including some substance abusers, joined the church. </P>
<P>	Reid also attracts men to Bethel by setting strict standards of individual moral 
responsibility. Foul language, lying, cheating, and adultery are simply not tolerated. No 
drinking, smoking, or blasphemy is allowed in the congregation. In his sermons, Reid 
cautions the men against excessive anger, spitefulness, and abusive behavior created by 
high stress and low self-esteem. He advises them to restrain their anger through a close 
relationship with Christ. "If men are unable to handle their emotions," he says, "then they 
become prime candidates for abusing their wives or girlfriends and children, as well as 
their friends and neighbors and, ultimately, the community."</P>
<P>	Reid is convinced that exacting standards of behavior do not drive men away, but 
attract them. Men are empowered by morality, he says; they gain courage and conviction 
when they know they are acting responsibly. He argues that the appeal of Malcolm X and 
Louis Farrakhan comes more from their moral authority than their religion. Christianity, 
too, must emphasize its firmness along with its love and compassion. "Jesus drew strong 
fishermen to him," Reid says. "His moral authority was a magnet."</P>
<P>	Reid challenges the males in his congregation to be men rather than boys. "You 
can be 65 and still be a boy," he preaches. "You can be 45, married with children, and 
still be a boy. The difference between a boy and a man is that a man loves God and takes 
responsibility for himself and others."</P> 
<P>	Many congregants fail to live up to the church's standards. But all men are 
welcome. No stigma is placed on former convicts and drug-abusers. At each service, Reid 
asks men who have been incarcerated to stand and be applauded. Reid preaches that 
everybody in the church is sinful, citing the biblical injunction, "We were born in sin and 
shaped in iniquity, and we all have fallen short of the glory of God." </P>
<P>	Bethel provides wrongdoers with encouragement coupled with discipline. Biblical 
passages are cited to show why the behavior in question is wrong. The church is firm in 
response to wrongful deeds, but forgiving. The man admits his error, and he and Reid 
discuss ways to make restitution and bring healing for the wrongs he has committed. Reid 
strongly emphasizes restitution, arguing that one has a responsibility to bring wholeness 
to that which one has broken.</P>
<P>	Changa Onyanga used to be a lieutenant in the drug culture. When he first entered 
Bethel to visit a former member of his gang, he had no respect for ministers like Reid. "I 
looked him up and down and pressed on." Onyanga says now. "I did not speak to him. 
Besides, preachers had a bad rap because they were not doing anything for people who 
needed a cause to champion."</P>
<P>	Reid noted Onyanga's "terrible disposition" and responded. "No one walks 
around this church and does not speak," Reid said to him. "We are friendly and we speak 
to one another as Christians should." Reid had Onyanga's friend talk to him and teach 
him about the decorum of his church. Onyanga has since joined Bethel.</P>
<P>	In preaching personal responsibility, Reid acknowledges his own errors. Happily 
married with two daughters, eight and two, Reid also fathered a son out of wedlock 
during an earlier pastorate in Charlotte, North Carolina. "I do not deny my 15-year-old 
son," says Reid. "He is a reality." Although his son lives with the mother, Reid remains a 
significant part of his life. He provides monetary and moral support and communicates 
regularly. Reid even has him stand up in the congregation when he comes to visit.</P>
<P>	Reid tells the men that he has been where some of them are. Once they see that 
their spiritual leader is not above temptation, he believes, the men in his congregation can 
grapple more easily with issues of manhood and sexuality. </P>
<P>	Reid argues that spiritual leaders must be honest with men about their own 
failings. Some black men resist attending church because they regard the preachers as 
hypocrites. Reid chides his fellow clergy for not practicing what they preach. "Just 
because they received the calling," he says, "does not mean they are above the struggle or 
the contradictions." Citing St. Augustine and other great religious teachers who have 
acknowledged their sinfulness, he says pastors must realize they are preaching to 
themselves as well as to their congregations. </P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men includes working with women to restore male authority in 
the home. Men will be better fathers and husbands and will participate more willingly in 
church and community life, Reid argues, if they are allowed to exercise authority as head 
of the household. This does not mean tyranny or dictatorial control, but rather loving 
responsibility. Reid teaches men to be the protector, priest, provider, and partner of the 
household. The Old Testament instructs the man to be "watchman for his family."</P>
<P>	"We teach that the man should be the first person his wife goes to for prayer," 
Reid says. "If there is need for the pastor to come into the household, then it should be to 
pray for the family. But that can only happen if the man takes the leadership in making 
prayer a part of the household. The man should take the leadership for making sure Bible 
study is part of family life." Reid preaches that wives should submit to their husbands, 
but also that husbands must not abuse this authority. "Paul's letter to the Ephesians 
teaches us: `Woman, submit thyself if your man loves you as Jesus loves the church,' "  
he says. "If the husband does not love his wife as Jesus loved the church, then she has no 
responsibility to submit to him. We submit to Jesus out of the fact that he loved us." </P>
<P>	The principle of male headship does not mean that the husband must be the 
primary breadwinner. "We teach the men that wives' earnings should not bruise their 
ego," says Reid. "A husband should be thankful when a woman who earns more, or has 
more education, looks to him as protector and provider." The word "provider," Reid 
points out, comes from the Latin for "seeing." It means supplying a family's vision as 
much as providing its material sustenance.</P>
<P>	Reid also teaches women how to respond to men in the household. Annette 
Brown, for example, used Reid's sermon on "a loving God" to endure six years of 
estrangement from her husband, Kevin. "There were times when my husband was gone 
for four days without contact," says Brown, "but pastor Reid's message told me to look 
beyond his faults and see his needs." Annette and Kevin are back together, and their 
relationship is stronger. He has joined Bethel and resumed his role as father of their two 
sons. He has even begun to prepare for the ministry.</P>
<P>	Brown is the religious leader and disciplinarian of the household. He is also in 
charge of sex education. Brown settles family decisions after family prayer. Matters in 
which he reserves the final say include private school for their children, vacations, family 
transportation, his work hours, visits to relatives, and house-buying. But his wife controls 
the household finances. She submits to him because he submits to the church. "Kevin 
takes the authority in the household," she says. "When there is a decision, he makes the 
final decision." She reserves the right to veto any decision not in the family's best 
interest, but she adheres to Biblical scripture: Better to live on a corner of the roof than 
share a house with a quarrelsome wife. "I always uplift my husband," she says.</P>
<P>	Reid denies that this approach oppresses women. "I have not talked to a single 
African-American woman," he says, "who has said `no' when I have asked whether she 
would gladly submit to a man who loved Christ, who provided for her and her children, 
who would protect her, and was spiritual. They recognize that the submission would not 
be an oppressive submission, but a submission in partnership." </P>
<P>	Reid encourages men to marry or, if they are separated, to reunite with the 
mothers of their children. But he does not always counsel marriage. "It makes no sense," 
he says, "to push together a couple that does not love each other. If the mother has 
become pregnant for the wrong reasons--out of lust, for example, or to get welfare 
payments--then it may not be possible for the father to exercise loving authority as head 
of the household."</P>
<P>	"In an ideal world, it is easy to say, `if you make a baby, then marry the mother,' " 
Reid says. "But as a pastor, I have to deal with the hard facts of family conflict. What 
happens to the child who grows up in a home where the parents hate each other because 
you made them get married? The child will grow up with their hostility and take it out 
into the world."</P> 
<P>	Reid thinks public policy treats African-American men with illegitimate children 
too harshly. He is especially troubled by a court system that cuts fathers off from their 
children. Men are presumed guilty in disputes over child support; visitation can be denied 
at the mother's request. Reid says the system "tortures fathers, who often want to do the 
right thing for their children, and is unfairly slanted toward the mother."</P>
<P>	According to Reid, models of Christian manhood from African and African-
American history are essential in attracting black men to church. Before becoming full 
members of Bethel, men must spend an hour with the pastor, who teaches them about 
Africans in the Bible and African-American church history. In this portion of his 
ministry, which he calls "roots," Reid tries to dispel the notion that Christianity is a 
Eurocentric, slave masters' religion. He teaches about the Africans Simeon (also called 
Niger) and Lucius of Cyrene, who ordained the Apostle Paul and Silas. He talks about the 
black abolitionist David Walker, who in 1829 published an anti-slavery tract known as 
the Appeal. This seminal publication demanded the end of slavery and appealed to the 
"God of the Ethiopians." </P> 
<P>	Another of Reid's models of black Christian manhood is Bishop Henry McNeil 
Turner. Born a slave in South Carolina, Turner became the first black chaplain of the 
Union army, a member of the South Carolina Legislature, and an advocate for the black 
emigration to Africa in 1874. His status as a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal 
Church allowed him to carry the African-American religious tradition to South Africa 
more than 100 years ago. </P> 
<P>	Reid also likes to point out to his African-American audience that Jesus may not 
have been as European-looking as Hollywood and other forms of  popular culture 
typically have portrayed him--white, blue-eyed, and fair-haired. He quotes a passage 
from the Old Testament book of Daniel that describes the Messiah, whose "feet were like 
burnished brass and his hair was like lamb's wool," and the New Testament book of 
Revelation, which similarly describes Jesus with feet "like bronze glowing in a furnace." 
Some church members, such as Charles Wiggins, say they were greatly affected by 
Reid's more raw, human portrait of Christ. "I had never heard a minister talk about Jesus 
who looked like me," says Wiggins, who joined in 1991. "I have found a home."</P>
<P>	Reid brings in guest lecturers to talk about African-American manhood. In a 
recent program, Na'im Akbar, a Florida State psychologist who is an expert on black 
male psychology, urged men at Bethel to learn from "the courage of Dr. King, the 
defiance of the honorable Elijah Muhammed, the economic strategy of Booker T. 
Washington, and the uncompromising integrity of Paul Robeson."</P>
<P>	Reid encourages the men to spiritually mold young males of the community. 
Through Project RAISE, they mentor teenagers from local schools. The men do not 
pressure them to join the church, but some do, attending Sunday services and Bible study 
with their mentors.</P>
<P>	After a small riot erupted at Booker T. Washington Junior High School just before 
Christmas last year, Bethel began a direct partnership with the school. To prevent a 
reoccurrence, Reid summoned 150 men to the school. They lined the street in front of the 
school and remained watchful for arsonists, gangs, and visiting troublemakers. At the 
request of the principal, the men recently returned to supervise the children in the 
morning and afternoon. The pupils' tranquillity prompted one teacher to comment that 
they were "acting like children again."</P>
<P>	Bethel assists men in running their households. In the class for new members, 
men are shown how to allocate their earnings. The 10-10-80 plan is a voluntary financial-
management procedure wherein 10 percent of the new member's yearly earnings is 
contributed to the church. Another 10 percent goes into a savings account, while the 
remainder is used for living expenses. </P>
<P>	Men who need additional help in managing their finances can attend classes on 
preparing tax returns, taught by a CPA who donates her time. Bethel has helped its 
members form food co-ops and investment clubs for pooling risk capital, purchasing 
bonds and mutual funds, and setting up funds for children's college tuition.</P>
<P>	Reid and members of the congregation also find jobs for men. Some have 
convictions for crack use, weapons possession, or other felonies, while others possess 
little or no high school or college education. But Reid and other officers at Bethel often 
vouch for the character of church members who might not look good on paper.</P>
<P>	Reid himself hires men as security guards for the church. The security team not 
only protects the church and its membership; it gives young men the opportunity to 
"soldier"--to wear a uniform, carry walkie-talkies, use one's physical strength, and 
become close friends with other men. Reid argues that these are the principal lures of 
being in a gang. So why not channel these male yearnings into structures that help build 
spiritual soldiers?</P>
<P>	The security guards are called the Mighty Men of God after the warriors who 
followed King David.  There is no better symbol than these men of Reid's teaching that 
Christianity is a manly as well as a womanly religion. The Mighty Men of God hold 
respected positions in the church, including the leader of Bible study, sexton, and security 
guard. They are responsible for the safety of the congregation and community, and 
combat random crime with periodic community patrolling. </P>
<P>	The M.M.O.G. play an important role in the safety of the children who attend 
Bethel's day school. They greet parents and students each morning as they arrive. During 
the day, they guard against intruders and drug sales. At the end of the day, a Mighty Man 
of God sees each child safely across the street.</P>
<P>	The regimen of the M.M.O.G. requires discipline. They meet for two hours every 
Tuesday and Saturday. Officers open the meetings with a personal inspection. They 
check for fresh haircuts, cleanshaven faces, and shined shoes. Members are not allowed 
to smoke or drink, so officers check for burns and yellow stains from nicotine or 
marijuana. M.M.O.G. maintain two uniforms: a suit and a security outfit for guarding the 
church.</P>
<P>	After prayer, they discuss local and international events. Drilling, marching, and 
commands soon fill the room. An inspirational message from Reid follows, and the group 
closes with hand-holding prayer.</P>
<P>	One member of the Mighty Men of God is Max Taylor. After joining Bethel at the 
age of 18, Taylor joined forces with local drug dealers and descended into the world of 
drugs, guns, and violence. He was responsible for preparing street corners for potential 
drug sales. "I cleaned street corners for drug dealers by any means necessary," says 
Taylor, 29. He reached a point, he says, when he realized that if he continued he would 
soon "be dead or behind bars for a long time if I was arrested."</P>
<P>	In 1992, Taylor rejoined the church with rejuvenated purpose. He walked through 
local housing complexes challenging drug dealers, his old friends, for territory. "I was 
extremely cold and ruthless," says Taylor, "but due to the power of Frank Reid and God, 
I have changed."</P>

<h3> CHILDREN AND FAMILY IN AMERICA: CHALLENGES FOR THE 1990S </h3><P>

<b> By Wade F.  Horn, Ph.D.</b><br>
July 23, 1991<br>

<P>

     When I walked into my first meeting of the National Commission on
Children, I looked around the room and, observing that two-thirds of
the Commission were liberal Democrats, thought to myself, "What's a
good conservative like me doing in a place like this?"  Indeed, at the
beginning, at least, given the makeup of the Commission, the idea that
the final report would be anything that a conservative could support
seemed to be inconceivable.
<P>
     But, almost two years later, I did vote for the Commission's
final report, something which has prompted many of my friends to ask
me, and some not quite so politely, "What's a supposedly good
conservative like you doing voting for a report like that?"
<P>
     Today, I will attempt to answer that question, hopefully to the
satisfaction of my conservative friends here at The Heritage
Foundation.  But before doing so, I would like to first share my sense
of the status of children and families in America as well as some
basic principles which I believe should guide public policy in this
area.
<P>
     When one reads newspaper accounts of the status of children in
America, it is easy to become overwhelmed by the statistics -- and
some of the statistics are overwhelming:
<P>
 <UL> one million children abused and neglected every year;
<P>
     over 400,000 children living away from their families in
     substitute care;
<P>
     one in five children living in poverty.</UL>
<P>
     Statistics like these makes one wonder if there are any happy
children left in America
<P>
     The fact is, however, that although there are children who are
abused and neglected by their parents, the vast majority of children
are being raised by parents who care for and nurture them; although
there are children who are living away from their families in foster
care, the vast majority of children are living in homes with their own
parents; and although there are too many children living in poverty,
the vast majority of children do live in circumstances where their
material needs are adequately met.  The truth is that most children
are doing quite well, in spite of what we do in Washington.
<P>
     Upside Down View. But many so-called child advocates do not like
to emphasize this side of these statistics.  Instead, many child
advocates like to engage in what I call the "Poseidon Adventure"
school of child welfare -- the proclivity of many child advocacy
groups to turn the world upside down so that it appears that a happy
American childhood is a relic of the past.
<P>
     Adherents to such an upside down view of the world often become
uncomfortable when reminded that most American children are, in fact,
healthy, happy and secure, and living in loving, caring families. 
There was even a moment, about midway through the National
Commission's work, when some Commission members actually expressed
disappointment when told of the results of a public opinion survey,
which the Commission funded, which found that most American families
and communities are alive and well, that most parents are involved in
their children's lives, and that most parents and children feel good
about their family relationships.  It is quite interesting to note
that although the survey was originally intended to be an appendix to
the final report, the Commission's final report neglected to include a
summary of the results of this survey.  In psychology we call that
"selective forgetting."
<P>
     But just because most children in America are, in fact, healthy,
happy and secure, does not mean we should neglect to attend to those
who are at risk, whose chances for success are seriously endangered. 
We know, for example, that every day:
<P>
     <UL>2,500 children are born out of wedlock;
<P>
     700 low birthweight babies are born;
<P>
     135,000 children bring a gun to school;
<P>
     7,700 teenagers become sexually active;
<P>
     1,100 teenagers have abortions;
<P>
     600 teenagers get syphilis or gonorrhea; and
<P>
     6 teenagers commit suicide.</UL>
<P>
     After acknowledging that some children are, indeed, at-risk of
poor developmental outcomes, we must then ask why.  Conventional
wisdom says that families are buffeted by external forces -- economic
or whatever -- that are simply beyond their control.  This answer
drives a policy that relies on government intervention into family
matters.  It's no shock to people in this room that this has
essentially been our family policy for twenty-five years, and it
hasn't worked.
<P>
     I brought a much different perspective to the National Commission
on Children -- that much of what threatens our children results from
individual decisions and behaviors on the part of adults -- decisions
like abusing alcohol and drugs, having children out of wedlock, and
neglecting one's responsibility to support children both emotionally
and financially following a divorce.
<P>
     We know, for example, that adult drug abuse, and especially the
use of "crack cocaine," is the single most important factor behind the
escalating numbers of abused and neglected children in the United
States, as well as the rapid rise in the number of foster care
placements.  We also know that perhaps as many as 375,000 children
each year are starting off life already handicapped because parents
chose to "share" their drug habit with their unborn child.
<P>
     We also have a popular culture which chooses to, on a daily
basis, bombard developing children with messages that drugs are cool,
teenage sex is wonderful, parents don't know anything, and hard work
is for nerds.
<P>
     Mythology of Relativism. But perhaps most devastating of all, is
the fact that our culture has spent the last several decades deeply
inculcating a mythology -- the mythology of family relativism -- the
misguided belief that family structure is irrelevant, that no
configuration of family is better than any other.  Indeed, the need to
even form a family is questioned.  Family relativism lets us stop
worrying about many of our children, because it tells us that divorce
and single parenting have no real impact upon children.  And it
convinces us that something called "quality time" makes up for
unconnected parents.
<P>
     And how successful this mythology has been.  About half of
today's children will spend some time in a single-parent family before
they reach the age of 16.  Many children will attain single-parent
family status through divorce.  About half of all marriages today will
end in divorce and about one-half of all children whose parents do
divorce will experience a second divorce before they are 16 years old.
<P>
     For many other children the pathway to single-parent families is
through the failure of family formation.  Today, over 25 percent of
children now begin life in a single parent household; among blacks,
the figure is over 60 percent.
<P>
     Most Important Variable. The increasing numbers of children being
raised in single parent households is important because family
structure is the most important variable related to successful
outcomes for children.  As a group, children from one-parent families
exhibit above average rates of youth suicide, mental and physical
illness, violence, and drug use.  And the connection between crime and
single-parent homes is so strong that, when one controls for family
configuration, the relationship between crime and race as well as
crime and low-income disappears.
<P>
     There is also a strong relationship between single-parenting and
being raised in poverty.  According to David Elwood, single-mother
families have a poverty rate, after government transfers, of 38
percent, as compared to only 6 percent for two-parent families. 
Seventy-three percent of children in this country growing up in
single-parent families are poor for some time before age ten, as
compared to only 20 percent of children living in two-parent families. 
Indeed, the real reason more children are living in poverty today
compared to two decades ago is not because of any supposed decimation
of domestic spending by the Reagan and Bush Administrations, but
because the proportion of all children living in single-parent
households has more than doubled from 11 percent in 1970 to 25 percent
in 1990.
<P>
     This is particularly striking for blacks, where over the past two
decades the poverty rate for black children in single parent
households has remained nearly constant at about 65 percent, whereas
the poverty rate for black children in two-parent families actually
declined from 26 percent in 1970 to 19 percent in 1988.  The reason
why poverty among black children continues to be high despite
declining poverty rates for black children growing up in two-parent
families is that many more black children are being brought up in
single-parent families today compared to just two decades ago.
<P>
     Yet despite this mounting evidence, the connection between
single-parenting and poor outcomes for children has largely been
ignored in the development of public policy.  As Karl Zinsmeister
wrote in the June 1990 issue of the Atlantic Monthly:
<P>
    <UL> For the past quarter century American public policy has
     shied away from the idea that certain family forms are more
     desirable than others.  There is no attempt to promote child
     bearing within wedlock.  There is little penalty attached to
     child abandonment.  There is scant recognition of the social
     benefits of marriage, or of the social contributions of
     those who devote themselves to conscientious childrearing. 
     There is no reward from our public programs for standing by
     kith and kin.</UL>
<P>
     And a family that remains a family today spends less time being a
family.  William Mattox pointed out in last winter's Policy Review
that "parents today spend 40 percent less time with their children
than did parents in 1965."  A quote Mattox uses from Harvard
University child psychiatrist Robert Coles is a concise description of
the legacy of family relativism:
<P>
    <UL> Parents are too busy spending their most precious capital --
     their time and their energy -- struggling to keep up with
     MasterCard payments.  They're depleted.  They work long
     hours to barely keep up, and when they get home at the end
     of the day they're tired.  And their kids are left with a
     Nintendo or a pair of Nikes or some other piece of crap. 
     Big deal.</UL>
<P>
     Given this situation, what should be the proper role of
government in addressing these issues.  I believe that several
principles should guide us:
<P>
     First, the federal government should play an important leadership
role by elevating the discussion of these issues through "bully
pulpit" activities and by inspiring others to focus their resources
and energies on addressing these pressing concerns.  Department of
Health and Human Services Secretary Dr.  Louis Sullivan has been
especially effective in using this "bully pulpit" to elevate these
issues through his calls for the resurgence of a "culture of
character" and "communities of concern," as well as his advocacy of
healthy lifestyles.
<P>
     Second, we need to examine current social policies to determine
which may create perverse incentives that actually cause family
dissolution or a failure to form in the first place.  There are, for
example, instances where rents in public housing authorities skyrocket
should a single mother choose to marry.  And there is mounting
evidence that no-fault divorce laws may make family breakup too easy
an option, by leading to the impression that there is such a thing as
a "relatively painless divorce" -- a notion that is never true when
children are involved.
<P>
     Third, while government should continue to provide cash and non-
cash assistance to those who find themselves in poverty due to
circumstances beyond their control, there should be a recognition of a
reciprocity in government benefit programs -- that is, if one gets,
one has an obligation to give something back.  That was one of the
ideas behind the Family Support Act, as well as programs like Mom's
Place in Pennsylvania where single moms get quality child care in
exchange for going to school, getting good grades, and cleaning up the
center at the end of the child care day.
<P>
     Fourth, government needs to ensure that money earned by the
working poor is money brought home by the working poor.  That was the
idea behind the recent expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit.
<P>
     Fifth, the federal government should continue to fund well-
targeted programs designed to promote familial self-sufficiency by
combatting parental behaviors that tend to perpetuate long-term
welfare dependency -- programs like Head Start and JOBS.  But in doing
so, we should be careful not to confuse good intentions for effective
programs.  Consequently, before bringing every "good idea" to scale,
we should engage in the difficult work of determining program
effectiveness through research and evaluation studies.
<P>
     Finally, government programs and services should always be
designed to empower parents and strengthen families through maximizing
choice and local control of programs.
<P>
     So how does all of this square with the final report of the
National Commission on Children?  First, it is important to state that
I do not agree with everything contained within the final report. 
Indeed, I have some significant reservations about the final report
which I highlight in my letter of reservation contained in an appendix
in the report.  But there is much that I do endorse.
<P>
     First of all, the Commission resisted the temptation of "Poseidon
Adventure" thinking, and actually kept the statistical thinking right-
side-up, stating in the opening paragraph of the report that:
<P>
 <UL> Most American children are healthy, happy, and secure.  They
     belong to warm, loving families.  For them, life is filled
     with the joys of childhood -- growing, exploring, learning
     and dreaming -- and tomorrow is full of hope and promise.</UL>
<P>
     Similarly, the report states in the chapter on preparing
adolescents for adulthood:
<P>
    <UL> The majority of young people emerge from adolescence
     healthy, hopeful, and able to meet the challenges of adult
     life... They are progressing in school, they are not
     sexually active, they do not commit delinquent acts, and
     they do not use drugs or alcohol.</UL>
<P>
     Furthermore, the Commission did what it had to do if it wanted to
be honest to its mission of helping children -- it rejected family
relativism.  Indeed, one of the guiding principles for the entire
report states:
<P>
    <UL> Children do best when they have the personal involvement and
     material support of a father and a mother and when both
     parents fulfill their responsibility to be loving providers.
<P>
     Even more incredibly, the report goes on to state:
<P>
     Rising rates of divorce, out-of-wedlock childbearing, and
     absent parents are not just manifestations of alternative
     lifestyles, they are patterns of adult behavior that
     increase children's risk of negative consequences.
<P>
     And:
<P>
     There can be little doubt that having both parents living
     and working together in a stable marriage can shield
     children from a variety of risks.</UL>
<P>
     Not exactly a death knell perhaps, but plenty to make the
faithful followers of family relativism nervous.

     Talking About Values. In addition, the Commission report actually
talks about values, and about morals.  Not just talks about it, but
devotes an entire chapter to it, entitled "Creating a Moral Climate
for Children."  The very existence of this chapter reflects the belief
of the Commission that not all problems are solved by government
programs, but rather are best overcome by developing moral values in
children, and, in the words of Secretary Sullivan, a "culture of
character."
<P>
     And now we've got the moral relativists on the phone to the
family relativists, and they're both wondering what in the world
happened.
<P>
     Significantly, the Commission also endorsed public school choice. 
While not going as far as I and other members wanted to go -- which is
to include private schools as well -- it is a major push for parental
empowerment, and a recognition that the current educational
establishment is failing our nation's schools.
<P>
     And finally, the report reflects the view that the most effective
ways to help families achieve economic self-sufficiency are to:  1)
encourage the formation and stability of two-parent families; 2) make
work pay through the Earned Income Tax Credit; and 3) develop a
strategy for countering the decade-long tilt in the tax code against
families with children.
<P>
 <UL> For example, the report states:
<P>
     Clearly, living in a stable, two-parent family with one or
     both parents employed is the child's best hope for escaping
     poverty and having his or her basic material needs met. 
     Government should therefore actively encourage work,
     independence, and strong families.</UL>
<P>
     Flawed Proposals. Unfortunately, the Commission's major proposal
of a $1,000 refundable tax credit for children is flawed by a failure
of the liberal majority to explicitly tie the refundable nature of the
tax credit to a reduction in other government benefit programs.  As an
"add on" to welfare, such a refundable tax credit could potentially
lead to an increase in single-parenting, a violation of one of the
report's guiding principles.
<P>
     The report is also flawed by its failure to develop a reasonable
plan for paying for its proposals.  It's fair to say that a majority,
if not all, of the liberal Commissioners supported some sort of tax
increase -- although most of their ideas for increasing taxes reflect
the traditional liberal philosophy of, "I won't tax you, I won't tax
me, so I'll tax that guy behind the tree!"
<P>
     Some of us, on the other hand, considered the notion of paying
for a cut in taxes by raising taxes as ludicrous, and circular
thinking at its worst.  In our view, a program designed to support
families can not further erode their economic power with new taxes. 
More reasonable approaches put forth by a minority of members of the
Commission involved curtailing federal spending by cutting some
expenditures or capping growth in domestic spending.
<P>
     The Commission also did not reach consensus on health care.  The
liberal Democrats on the Commission endorsed a national health
insurance scheme which is essentially a repeat of the recommendations
of the Pepper Commission -- a previous Rockefeller-chaired commission
that also could not reach consensus on this issue.  Unfortunately, as
we stated in our minority chapter on health, the Rockefeller-endorsed
"play or pay" proposal would invariably lead to higher taxes, a
substantial loss of jobs, and discrimination against employees with
families -- a result which I find unconscionable for a National
Commission supposedly concerned about the welfare of families with
children.
<P>
     Positive Results Also. Nonetheless, and despite these
shortcomings and unfortunate events, I believe the message of the
report isn't lost, and shouldn't be wasted by conservatives.  For
years now we have been attacking mainstream policy thought as off the
mark, completely missing the issues and concerns that really matter to
families, and that can really make a difference to children.  The
result has been, as Zinsmeister says, a public policy that provides
"no reward... for standing by kith and kin."
<P>
     Now we have a report that pushes two-parent families, recognizes
the importance of values and morality, endorses school choice, and
acknowledges that what families need is not more government programs,
but to be allowed to keep more of the money they earn.
<P>
     The report has also helped to further sharpen the distinctions
between conservatives and liberals -- concerning both the proper role
for government in family matters and the way we pay for government. 
For example, the existence of two health chapters indicates that
liberals are for government mandates without regard for costs, either
in terms of increased taxes or job loss.  Liberals apparently are even
willing to tolerate discrimination against employees with families in
the name of government mandates.  Conservatives, on the other hand,
believe in empowering consumers and permitting undistorted markets to
function in medical care and health insurance as a means of providing
the best health care for the most people while targeting public
programs to those most in need.  In addition, the lack of consensus on
how to pay for the report's recommendations reveals that liberals
continue to refuse to even flinch at the idea of raising taxes,
whereas conservatives believe government should do everything it can
to keep taxes low and federal budget deficits small.
<P>
     But there is a danger in the report.  It may be, as some suspect,
that the liberals on the Commission didn't really believe in any of
the conservative rhetoric contained in the report and only agreed to
include it in order to obtain a unanimous vote.  Perhaps that's why
the title of the report, chosen after the final vote, reads "Beyond
Rhetoric."  So we must work hard at holding the liberal Commissioners'
feet to the fire, and insist that they remain true to the rhetoric and
message of the report.  We must constantly remind the liberal
Commission members that they endorsed the idea that the best way out
of poverty is not some government program, but rather for single
parents to get and stay married.  We must remind them that they
endorsed the idea of school choice precisely because the present
school establishment has failed our nation's children.  And we must
remind them that they endorsed the idea that the mass media must be
more responsible in their messages to children regarding drugs, sex
and hard work because moral values are important -- and in the long
run even more important than government programs.  Then let them
answer why "good liberals like them voted for a report like this."

<title>Crime Rates and Welfare Spending -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><I> CRIME RATES AND WELFARE SPENDING </i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott A. Hodge</a><br>
Grover M.  Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary
Affairs<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

F.Y.I. No. 24<br>
August 10, 1994<br>
<hr width=-50%></center><p>

The "Anti-Crime Bill" Congress will likely vote on this week
authorizes roughly $8.7 billion to create nearly 30 new "crime
prevention" programs ($7.4 billion for programs identified as
"prevention" and $1.3 billion for new "Drug Courts").  Many of these
new programs are little more than social welfare pork, adding a new
layer of bureaucracy on a welfare system that already costs taxpayers
at all levels of government over $310 billion per year.
<P>
      Supporters of the bill claim that crime will be reduced if
government provides community development aid, social services, job
training, and recreational activities.  They are wrong.
<P>
      Society has spent $5 trillion on the War on Poverty since 1965,
yet the national crime rate stands at its highest level ever.  As is
shown in the adjacent chart, welfare spending since 1965 has grown in
real terms by 800 percent while the number of major felonies per
capita today is roughly three times the typical rates before 1960. 
The evidence suggests that welfare spending, by promoting family
breakup, has played a large role in increasing, rather than decreasing
crime. (See Patrick F.  Fagan, "Rising Illegitimacy:  America's Social
Catastrophe," Heritage Foundation FYI No.  19, June 29, 1994.)

IT'S TIME TO THROW THE SWITCH ON THE FEDERAL CRIME BILL </h3>

<p>

<B> INTRODUCTION </B><P>
     Over the last three decades violent crime in America has
increased by more than 500 percent. The United States leads the
industrialized world in rates of murder, rape, and violent crime.
Nearly three out of every four convicted criminals are not
incarcerated. And fewer than one in ten serious crimes results in
imprisonment. Behind these statistics is, of course, human carnage. In
our inner cities in particular, the body count continues to mount.
This is the inevitable, tragic result of a breakdown of the moral
order and of our criminal justice system.
  <P>   The American public will not accept widespread lawlessness
indefinitely. If violent crime continues to rise, then people will at
some point look for a police state to restore order. Our free
democratic institutions cannot withstand much more crime without a
terrible counterreaction. Social anarchy often triggers an
authoritarian backlash.
    <P> We must regain control of our streets. The first responsibility
of government, after all, is the security of its citizens. The
relevant public policy question is: How do we once again provide basic
security? And here a caution is in order: Passage of the current crime
bill is not synonymous with achieving safe streets. Flawed legislation
wrapped in good rhetoric is still flawed legislation. A close analysis
of the crime bill demonstrates where it falls short. (See Paul J.
McNulty, "Rhetoric Versus Reality: A Closer Look at The Congressional
Crime Bill," Heritage Foundation Issue Bulletin No. 189, May 16,
1994.)
  <P>   Regardless of their rhetoric, Members of Congress are not going
to cure America's epidemic of violent street crime with the enactment
of a federal crime bill. Street crime is largely a matter of state and
local law enforcement; indeed, more than 98 percent of all such
violent crimes falls under the jurisdiction of state and local law
enforcement authorities. But more important, Members of Congress are
using the crime issue as a pretext for doing what they do best:
increasing federal spending on social programs. In this instance, they
are increasing social spending on everything from midnight basketball
leagues to arts and crafts programs. And while legislators are using
ruthless rhetoric against violent criminals, they are seriously
considering the establishment of a racially based, death penalty quota
system ensuring that the imposition of the death sentence is
effectively ended at both the state and the federal level. Indeed, the
measure now before Congress would likely further emasculate the
independence and the authority of state and local law enforcement
officials in fighting violent street crime.
 <P>    Instead of a fundamentally flawed crime bill, which pointlessly
federalizes local street crime, state and local officials should be
empowered and given the resources to combat violent criminals, locking
up felons for their full sentence and ending "revolving door justice."
Instead of establishing a new federal "anti-crime" regime, Congress
should aim at maximizing state and local flexibility, while stopping
the intrusion of the federal judiciary in the administration of state
prison systems. Instead of hamstringing state and local law
enforcement with new federal regulations, Members of Congress should
make changes in federal law to stop the endless appeals of convicted
violent felons and encourage state and local officials to adopt the 24
effective anti-crime measures recommended by former Attorney General
William Barr. (For more information on these recommendations, see Mary
Kate Cary, "How States Can Fight Violent Crime: Two Dozen Steps to a
Safer America," Heritage Foundation State Backgrounder No. 944/S, June
7, 1993.)
  <P>   And finally, Members of Congress can really help in a tangible
way by giving state residents a federal tax rebate proportional to
increased state spending to fight violent street crime at the state
and local level.
<P>
<B> SOME GOOD PROVISIONS </B><P>
     Given Americans' growing fear of violent crime, it is
understandable that Members of Congress would want to support another
federal crime bill, even if it falls far short of effective
legislation. The House and Senate versions of the bill have "truth in
sentencing provisions" which would require violent criminals to serve
at least 85 percent of their time. (James Wootton, "Truth in
Sentencing: Why States Should Make Violent Criminals Do Their Time,"
Heritage Foundation State Backgrounder No. 972/S, December 30, 1993.)
If actually funded, these provisions would incapacitate large numbers
of violent criminals. But in the inevitable congressional horsetrading
on Capitol Hill, new social programs are likely to be more politically
potent than new prison space.
   <P>  On key issues, the House and Senate are far apart on the details.
Proposed federal money for state prisons amounts to $13 billion in the
House bill and $3 billion in the Senate version. And there is also
federal money for hiring community police ($9 billion in the Senate
version, and $3.5 billion in the House bill). But even if Members of
Congress agree on the right funding formulas, there is yet no adequate
funding mechanism in the crime package. Currently, Members of Congress
are considering a special trust fund created by the elimination of
252,000 federal jobs over the next five years. This funding provision
appears in the Senate bill; the House bill has no funding mechanism at
all. Thus, Congress can promise funding for anti-crime measures, but
without an explicit and effective funding mechanism, the entire
congressional anti-crime enterprise could become another rhetorical
exercise.
<P>
<B> A BATCH OF BAD IDEAS </B><P>
     While American taxpayers are promised more police on the streets
and more prison space for violent criminals, the major effect of the
federal crime bill is to federalize violent street crime, burdening
state and local authorities with even more federal rules and
regulations while making them increasingly dependent on Washington's
largesse. For example:
<P>
More Social Spending. 
 <P>    In spite of the fact that Washington has racked up a record of
failure in social programs, the House version of the crime bill
contains roughly $9.2 billion in Sixties-style social programs to
"prevent crime." This includes $40 million for business partnerships
administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
midnight basketball with federal rules even detailing the composition
of neighborhood teams, "self-esteem" classes, arts and crafts, dance
classes and physical training programs, and "conflict resolution"
training.
<P>
Outcome-Based Executions. 
  <P>   In the House version of the bill, a provision called the "Racial
Justice Act" would enable a person convicted of a capital crime to
invoke statistical evidence that his execution would reinforce a
pattern of racial discrimination. Moreover, the burden is on the state
to prove it was not discriminating in imposing the death penalty. And
because the provision is retroactive to all those now on death row --
a total of 3,800 -- it could tie up the courts for years. Indeed, a
California case where the convict used such a defense took over three
years -- at a cost of $1 million -- before the state could execute the
sentence. But the worst feature of this provision is the message that
it sends: race, not the crime, would be the most important factor in
the imposition of the death sentence. The result: a death sentence
could be invalidated by irrelevant data.
<P>
More Federal Intrusion Into State Law Enforcement. 
  <P>   Virtually all violent street crime is under the jurisdiction of
state and local government. State legislators, not Members of
Congress, have primary responsibility for combatting violent street
crime. Yet in the Senate version of the bill, more crimes are added to
the federal crime code. For example, trafficking in stolen credit
cards, defrauding a person of more than $1,000 in credit card
stealing, telemarketing fraud, and increased street gang activity are
to be put under federal jurisdiction. In the meantime, the House
version of the bill has added 66 new federal death penalties, coupled,
of course, with the House adoption of the "Racial Justice Act" to make
sure they are never actually carried out. And while Members of the
House of Representatives have been posturing on the death penalty, the
Clinton Administration has been cutting back on federal law
enforcement agent strength, both at the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) and at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
This is, of course, a recipe for bitter cynicism on the part of
America's taxpayers.
<P>
More Federal Control Over Local Police. 
 <P>    Both the White House and Capitol Hill are committed to increasing
the number of police. While the Clinton Administration has asked for
100,000 more police officers, the House version contains 50,000
additional slots. While no personnel decision is more important than
the hiring of a cop -- a job where individual merit is paramount --
the House bill calls for state and local authorities to adopt racial,
ethnic, and gender guidelines in police hiring. While these are not
explicit quotas, in practice they are likely to become so, especially
given the heavy dependence on centralized federal financing. Over 88
percent of the funding is controlled not by states and localities, but
by the Executive Branch. And because the funding for these police
slots will end in five years, localities will either have to cut their
police force, a politically unattractive option, or lobby Washington
for even more federal funding and concomitant federal control.
<P>
<B> A BETTER IDEA </B>
   <P>  American taxpayers are not going to feel safer because Congress
talks tough on crime, while it increases spending on arts and crafts
for juvenile delinquents. While there are good provisions in the
Senate and House package, the heavy mixture of bad proposals or a
variation of them are certain to survive in the congressional
logrolling that normally characterizes House and Senate conference
business.
<P>    Instead, Members of Congress should do it right. They should
recognize that combatting violent street crime is a state and local
responsibility. They should target their efforts to helping the state
and local police upgrade the detection and apprehension of criminals,
and assist state and local authorities in prosecuting and
incarcerating violent criminals. 
<P>     Toward this end, Members of Congress should: 

Establish a special trust fund for the states to fight crime. 
    <P> Under a proposal by Representative James Sensenbrenner (R-WI),
H.R. 4592, Congress would set aside an amount equal to 2 percent of
the personal income tax revenues, and rebate it to the states to cover
increased state expenditures to combat violent crime. State
expenditures would include spending on police, construction of the
operation of prisons, and other aspects of the state criminal justice
system, including truth in sentencing. The Sensenbrenner proposal
would rebate between $45 billion to $55 billion to the states to fight
crime over the next five years.
<P>
Eliminate federal judicial micromanagement of state prison systems. 
 <P>    Congress can restrain federal judges from arrogating wide-ranging
administrative powers to themselves, overriding state executive and
legislative authorities, and imposing "prison caps" that result in the
early release of criminals.
<P>
Reform key federal rules governing the criminal justice system. 
 <P>   This would include habeas corpus reform, to prevent convicted
felons from tying up the court systems with endless appeals. Such
reform would also include establishing a "good faith" exception to the
exclusionary rule, meaning criminals would not be able to beat the rap
because the police secured otherwise solid evidence in a technically
imperfect search and seizure operation.
<P>
     While Members of Congress could assist state and local
authorities in very tangible ways, there is no reason why the Justice
Department could not publish a "Wall Chart," comparing states and
localities with each other, with a rank ordering of their performance
in combatting violent crime, including arrests, convictions,
imprisonment, and adherence to truth-in-sentencing standards. With a
way to compare performance, taxpayers could bring pressure to bear on
lax state and local officials far more effectively than through the
ministrations of federal officials.
  <P>  In the meantime, Members of Congress should refrain from talking
tough about violent street crime while they promote policies that
would only further erode their already damaged credibility. Instead,
they should salvage the few sound policy options left in the crime
bill, and make a fresh start on a tough problem.
 <P>    Of course, we should not allow the discussion of legislation to
obscure the most obvious points. The best approach to crime control is
to keep young people from ever falling into the criminal justice
system in the first place. We now ask prisons to do what fathers once
did and ask the entire criminal justice system to do what parents,
schools, and neighborhoods once did. More broadly, as a society we
simply need to become more civilized. I say "simply" because there is
a tendency to over-intellectualize our task or to throw up our hands
in despair. Intelligent, tough-minded public policies can help achieve
greater domestic tranquillity. But in the end, regeneration in a free
society must come from within. We need to revivify old republican
virtues like self-control, prudence, honor, and fidelity to
commitments. They have been, and remain, the cornerstones of civil
society.

<h3>
RHETORIC VS. REALITY: A CLOSER LOOK AT THE CONGRESSIONAL CRIME BILL </h3>

By Paul J. McNulty<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

Issues Bulletin No. 189<br>
May 16, 1994<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p> 


<B> INTRODUCTION </B>
<P>

     If Americans think that Congress is going to be effective in
fighting violent crime, they are likely to be disappointed.
Congressional rhetoric on violent crime is very tough, but the reality
of the anti-crime legislation is very different. Major differences
between versions of federal anti-crime legislation await resolution by
Senate and House conferees as they attempt to reconcile the crime bill
passed by the Senate last November (S. 1488 and S. 1607) and the one
approved by the House last month (H.R. 4092).
<P>
     While both versions of the bill and related measures contain
superficially attractive language on such items as increased police
presence, bans on "assault weapons," and the federal "three-strikes-
and-you're-out" provision, it is a safe bet that the bill which
finally reaches the President's desk will not reduce violent crime.
For example, the "get-tough" provisions, including an expansive new
death penalty for about sixty different federal crimes, would be used
exclusively by a shrinking federal law enforcement team which deals
with just a tiny fraction of all violent crime. In 1990, state courts,
not federal courts, handled over 98 percent of all violent crime
convictions. (See "The Crime Bill: Much Ado About Nothing," National
Center for Policy Analysis Brief Analysis No. 106, April 15, 1994.)
Thus, in dealing with the violent street crime that plagues so many
inner-city residents, these elaborate death sentence threats will go
largely unused. Moreover, the House version of the crime bill contains
a racial quota system (the so-called Racial Justice Act) that would
make the imposition of the death penalty virtually impossible.
Complains Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, ranking Republican on the
Senate Judiciary Committee, "While pretending to get serious about
crime, they have inserted into the House crime bill a set of
provisions that would in effect abolish the death penalty nationwide
-- both at the federal level and among the states." (Senator Orrin
Hatch, "Dear Colleague," April 25, 1994.) 
<P>
      The one truly useful proposal, billions of new dollars for state
prisons, is the target of substantial liberal congressional
opposition. If opponents are successful in the conference committee,
even this reasonable proposal likely will be of little benefit to
Americans desperately seeking relief from the continuing scourge of
violent crime.
<P>
     In fact, expectations are so low that many knowledgeable analysts
simply hope that the federal crime bill will do no harm to the
existing criminal justice system, a tragic testimony to the lack of
political leadership in Washington. The fact that the "Racial Justice
Act" is being seriously considered reveals the legitimacy of such
concerns.
<P>

<B> WHAT TAXPAYERS NEED IN THE CRIME BILL </B>
<P>
     Nevertheless, while the shape of the congressional response to
violent crime may not inspire confidence, it may still be possible to
salvage sound policy prescriptions and have a meaningful crime bill
this year. Such a bill would have as its primary focus the goal of
providing maximum assistance to the states in their battle against
violent crime. It is the states, not the federal government, that bear
the greatest responsibility for combatting violent crime. Moreover,
federal policies, particularly requirements tied to federal grants,
should not hamstring state and local law enforcement officials.
Accordingly, the final crime package should contain provisions that
include:
<P>
1)  Federal funding for imprisonment of violent criminals. At least
    $10 billion should be available to the states for the construction
    and operation of state prisons as an incentive for them to reform
    their sentencing laws. This would make the bill's "truth in
    sentencing" provisions a reality, ensuring that violent criminals
    serve their time. (For an excellent discussion of "truth in
    sentencing," see James Wootton, "Truth in Sentencing: Why States
    Should Make Violent Criminals Do Their Time," Heritage Foundation
    State Backgrounder No. 972/S, December 30, 1993.)
 <P>

2)  A serious death penalty. This means establishment of a federal
    death penalty for truly federal crimes -- a death penalty that
    will not take more than a decade to carry out after sentence is
    imposed. 
<P>
3)  A restraint on federal courts that put violent criminals back on
    the streets. This would mean, as a matter of federal policy,
    cutting back on prison population caps and other controls imposed
    by federal courts on state prison and local jail systems.
 <P>
4)  Improvements in the prosecution and punishment of federal violent
    crimes, particularly sexual assaults. This would include
    increasing penalties for violent federal crimes and expanding the
    range of admissible evidence in federal sexual assault cases,
    especially to serve as models for state law.
<P>
5)  Restoration of the strength of federal law enforcement agencies.
    While talking tough on crime, the Clinton Administration has cut
    agent and prosecutor strength in such key federal law enforcement
    agencies as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Drug
    Enforcement Administration (DEA). If Congress is serious about
    toughening federal law enforcement, this policy should be
    reversed. 
<P>
 <B> WHAT TAXPAYERS DO NOT NEED IN A FEDERAL CRIME BILL </B>
<P>
     In fashioning a new federal crime policy, Congress must make sure
that it does no harm to the efforts of state and local law enforcement
officials. This means:
<P>
1)  No death penalty quotas. The "Racial Justice Act" included in the
    House version of the crime bill would enable a prisoner convicted
    of a capital crime to offer statistical evidence that imposition
    of a death sentence in his case would be racially discriminatory.
    Such data would automatically require the state to prove that
    racial discrimination was not involved, imposing a burden that
    would be difficult, if not possible, to overcome unless the
    government previously had established a quota system based on
    local racial demographics. Under the terms of the House bill, this
    would be applied retroactively, in effect giving convicted felons
    yet another avenue of appeal to avoid the death penalty. This new
    system of "Outcome-Based Executions" would undermine the principle
    of individual justice.
<P>
2)  No new federal rules hamstringing state law enforcement. This
    includes, for example, the House-passed "Repeat Violent Offender
    Incarceration Act," which, while sounding innocuous enough,
    actually may require states to "assure" that they are reducing
    prison time for drug traffickers. 
<P>
3)  No new federal rules governing state and local police work. This
    includes congressional restrictions on federal funding for police
    officers that would have the effect of turning cops into social
    workers. Under no circumstances should federal policy encourage
    any kind of hiring or promotion quotas for police officers. As
    Representative James Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican who
    is the ranking Member of the House Subcommittee on Crime and
    Criminal Justice, observes, the House version of the crime bill
    recommends that states and cities "seek and recruit members of
    racial, ethnic and gender minority groups." (Rep. F. James
    Sensenbrenner Jr., "A Real Crime Crisis and A Fake Crime Bill,"
    The Washington Times, April 6, 1994, p. A-19.) No personnel
    decision in the criminal justice system is more important than the
    hiring of a police officer, whose individual merit -- especially
    courage, judgment, integrity, and intelligence -- is critical in
    making life and death decisions. 
<P>
4)  No expansion of taxpayer funding of social programs. Liberals in
    Congress view public anxiety over crime as an excellent reason to
    fund more government social programs. The House bill contains $8
    billion worth of social welfare spending, (Ibid.) even though most
    taxpayer funding for social programs has little or nothing to do
    with genuine law enforcement. The bill includes funding for such
    things as arts and crafts programs and basketball leagues, replete
    with absurd federal requirements governing youth basketball
    participation. It is even more remarkable that Members of Congress
    would resort to social welfare spending in combatting crime when
    one considers that such spending is now at all-time high and that
    welfare spending per capita, in constant dollars, is five times as
    high as in 1965, the beginning of the "Great Society." (See Robert
    Rector, "Combatting Family Disintegration, Crime and Dependence: 
    Welfare Reform and Beyond," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.
    983, April 8, 1994, p.5.) 

<P>
<B> THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FEDERAL CRIME BILL </B>
<P>
     In May 1989, President George Bush unveiled his comprehensive
violent crime control proposal to a large gathering of police
officers. President Bill Clinton hopes soon to stand before a similar
audience to announce completion of this process started five years ago
by his predecessor. (The Crime Control Act of 1990 was not viewed as
important anti-crime legislation. It included only provisions that
enjoyed the unanimous support of the conferees. Thus, despite lopsided
victories in the House and Senate on President Bush's proposals, the
final bill was largely a wasted effort.) Before this can happen,
however, Congress must agree on the details of this complex and
politically divisive legislative package. To that end, House and
Senate conferees are working to resolve many crucial policy
differences between their respective bills.
<P>
     In resolving these differences, Members of Congress must answer
three basic and critically important policy questions:
<P>
1)  How should the federal government spend $22 billion to combat
    violent crime in America?
<P>
2)  What should be the role of federal law enforcement in relation to
    violent street crime?
<P>
3)  To what extent should the federal government involve itself in the
   administration of capital punishment at the state level?
<P>
     If the conferees reach a consensus on these three questions, they
will have resolved the most significant issues presented to them by
the federal crime legislation, including whether to spend money on
prisons or so-called prevention programs, whether to expand federal
law to cover nearly all crimes involving firearms, and whether to
impose insurmountable burdens on prosecutors in states with capital
punishment.
<P>

<B> WHERE WILL TAXPAYERS' DOLLARS GO? </B>
<P>
     The crime legislation authorizes huge amounts of new federal
spending whose targets are easily identified: police, prisons, or
prevention.
<P>
     When the Senate passed its crime bill last November, it created a
violent crime reduction trust fund of $22 billion from anticipated
savings over the next five years from attrition in the federal
workforce. How to spend this $22 billion will present some tough
choices for the conferees. Making matters even more difficult, the
House bill includes nearly $28 billion in new spending. In fact, taken
together, the two bills include nearly $40 billion worth of ideas.
Some of the ideas are good, some are bad, and others are simply
irrelevant to the serious task of fighting violent crime. 
<P>
     The major spending proposals are:
<P>
     $9 billion (Senate bill) and $3.5 billion (House bill) for "cops
       on the beat."
<P>
     $13 billion for state prisons (House bill), $3 billion for
       regional prisons (Senate bill), $4 billion for correctional
       options and alternatives to prison (Senate bill).
<P>
     $9 billion (House bill) and $1.2 billion (Senate bill) for
       miscellaneous crime prevention/social programs, many of which
       fall under a new program entitled the "Ounce of Prevention"
       initiative.
<P>
     The Police. The Clinton Administration seems most interested in
securing federal money for police and prevention. The President
promised 100,000 more police in his election campaign and continues to
emphasize this issue in his crime speeches. At least three key
problems remain, however, concerning the benefits and nature of this
initiative. First, how can financially strapped local jurisdictions
pay the 25 percent matching fund requirement in both bills and afford
the cost of keeping the new police on board as the federal
contribution steadily declines? Second, will local governments retain
genuine control over hiring decisions and the type of work that the
new officers will perform, or will the federal government require
these individuals to fit into a mold pre-designed in Washington, where
many see community policing as another form of social welfare service?
Third, how will the criminal justice system handle the violent
criminals added to the pipeline as a result of more arrests (assuming
Washington allows them to make arrests)? There are about 550,000
arrests for violent crime in the entire nation each year, and one
violent crime arrest each month by an additional 100,000 police would
more than double the current number.
<P>
     Attorney General Janet Reno has championed the "prevention"
programs ever since she arrived in Washington. She appears convinced,
despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that traditional social
welfare programs will strengthen families and reduce juvenile crime.
And even though the public is generally favorable to making violent
criminals serve their full time, a change that requires greater prison
capacity, the attorney general is no advocate of additional prison
capacity.
<P>
     If the conferees follow the Clinton Administration's lead with
regard to community policing, they will be left with about $30 billion
of additional programs and only $13 billion of the original $22
billion available to spend. This will result in one of two outcomes:
1) a confrontation between supporters of money for prisons and
proponents of more social welfare spending under the guise of
"prevention" spending or 2) the familiar dodge whereby Members of
Congress merely authorize spending on all of the proposals, leaving it
to congressional appropriators to make the hard choices and decide in
the years ahead who gets real money.
<P>
     Prisons vs. Prevention -- A False Dichotomy. Any confrontation
between prisons and prevention should involve a serious discussion
about the nature of crime prevention. Congressional proponents of more
social spending insist that more prisons will not reduce crime;
instead, federal legislation must be aimed at the "social conditions"
from which violent criminals often emerge. Representative Cardiss
Collins (D-IL), clearly expressed this view on the House floor during
the crime bill debate: "Any crime measure that budgets more for
prisons than job training is not sufficient to the task of fighting
crime."
<P>
     Once again, congressional liberals are wrong. Drawing a
distinction between prisons and prevention poses a false dichotomy.
Removing violent criminals from the streets is crime prevention, as
relevant statistics prove. For example, recidivism declines when
younger violent criminals serve longer percentages of their prison
sentences, (U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,
Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 1983 (NCJ-116261), April 1989, p.
3.) repeat offenders commit a large number of crimes when they are out
of prison, (U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, Protecting America: The Effectiveness of the
Federal Armed Career Criminal Statute, March 1992, p. 29.) and there
is an inverse relationship between rates of incarceration and rates of
crime. (U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Policy Development, The
Case for More Incarcerations (NCJ-139583), October 1992, p. 10.)
<P>
     The preventive effect of incarceration also is supported by the
four basic purposes for prison: incapacitation (the offender obviously
cannot commit crimes against law-abiding citizens when he is in
prison), retribution (justice is strengthened when offenders pay their
debt to society), deterrence (offenders are less likely to commit
crimes if the punishment is swift and severe), and rehabilitation.
There is widespread debate among students of the American criminal
justice system as to the effectiveness of rehabilitation, but this
issue also represents an area of potential agreement for pro-prison
and pro-social welfare advocates. And while retribution may involve
philosophical considerations and deterrence may turn largely on
empirical data, there can be no doubt about the value of
incapacitation in preventing crime. Anyone who has been victimized by
someone who should have been in prison at the time -- and there are
perhaps thousands of such victims each day -- can testify to the
certainty that imprisonment prevents crime.
<P>
     More Social Welfare Spending -- In a Crime Bill? It is beyond
dispute that an enormous variety of social programs, including welfare
spending, continue to receive a major portion of government spending.
These programs include urban and community aid, social services,
training and jobs, housing, education and energy assistance, medical
assistance, food stamps, and cash assistance. As Heritage Foundation
Senior Policy Analyst Robert Rector has noted, "From the start of the
War on Poverty in 1965 to the present, welfare spending has cost the
taxpayers $4.9 trillion in constant 1992 dollars. This is greater than
the cost of defeating Germany and Japan in World War II, after
adjusting for inflation." (Rector, op. cit. p. 6.) Thus, the argument
that government has ignored social spending as a means of attacking
the "root causes" of crime is inconsistent with the facts. (It is
true, of course, that federal policy makers have failed to address the
"root causes" of crime in terms of exploding illegitimacy, family
disintegration, and the collapse of traditional values in many crime-
ridden communities.)
<P>
     Congressional opponents of more prison spending claim that
building prisons has not reduced crime because crime has not declined.
This is akin to arguing that using a bucket to bail a leaking boat
does not reduce the amount of water in a boat with a hole in the
bottom because the water is still coming into the boat -- never mind
that the boat would sink without using the bucket. If a lack of
concrete results for dollars spent is the basis for embarrassment,
congressional advocates of another round of Great Society-style social
spending should have the good sense to break off the public
discussion.
<P>
     What Kind of Prevention Programs Are They, Anyway? Finally, it
must be observed that many of the programs being proposed are an odd
assortment of social programs that appear to be the product of "pop"
psychology. Under the House version of the crime bill, Congress would
authorize spending taxpayers' money for arts and crafts, Olympic
training, self-esteem classes, conflict resolution training for
violent teens, and midnight basketball leagues. Naturally, federal
programs mean federal rules which, in the case of the new midnight
basketball leagues in the House bill, are neat and precise: each
league must have eight teams with no more than ten players on each
team, and half of the players must live in government-subsidized low-
income housing projects. In a country where the average murderer
spends only eight-and-a-half years behind bars because of insufficient
prison capacity, it is curious to insist on spending limited taxpayer
dollars on arts and crafts.
<P>

<B> THE ROLE OF FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT </B>
<P>
     The second question Members of Congress must address concerns the
role of federal law enforcement in combatting street-level violence.
Both crime bills, but particularly the Senate version, contain several
new offenses and penalties aimed at such crime. In addition to death
penalty offenses for murder with a firearm, drive-by shootings, and
car-jackings, the bills establish new crimes for gang activity,
criminal use of firearms, and juvenile crime. Provisions relating to
sexual and domestic violence would be enforceable only on federal
lands such as Indian reservations.
<P>
     The much-discussed "three-strikes-and-you're-out" provision would
not expand the jurisdiction of federal law enforcement, but it would
increase the penalty for conviction of a federal violent crime after
two similar federal or state convictions. President Clinton has
developed an attractive "tough on crime" soundbite in pushing for this
penalty, but the reality is that current federal law already severely
punishes such offenders.
<P>
     It used to be easy to spot the difference between the role of a
Member of Congress and the role of a state legislator in crime
legislation. The Constitution clearly distinguishes between the
national responsibilities of the general government and the domestic
and particular responsibilities of state governments. State
legislators, not Members of Congress, have direct responsibility for
enacting the rules that govern state and municipal law enforcement. 
<P>
           In the 1980s, Congress spent most of its legislative energy
focusing on drug abuse, grant programs to assist state and local law
enforcement, and procedural reforms affecting federal prosecutors.
Within the past few years, however, the direct involvement of federal
law enforcement in countering urban violence has emerged as a major
issue. Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) initiated much of the debate in
1991 with an amendment that would give federal law enforcement
jurisdiction over nearly all crimes committed with a gun. This idea is
very popular in Congress. D'Amato's amendment has passed the Senate
twice by overwhelming margins. Not surprisingly, it also has been
strongly opposed by many prominent conservatives, including Supreme
Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
<P>
     Meanwhile, as the legislative debate has continued, federal law
enforcement has become ever more involved in the fight against street
violence. Since possession of a firearm by a felon is a violation of
federal law, it has been relatively easy for the federal government to
arrest and prosecute tens of thousands of violent criminals. This new
role has been well received in states where violent crime has soared
and criminal justice systems have been largely dysfunctional. For
example, local law enforcement officials in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, have praised federal authorities for the aggressive role
they played in attacking drug trafficking gangs from 1989 to 1992; the
federal government was able to "lean forward" and assist a local
government that was unable to detain offenders pre-trial because of a
court-imposed cap on its jail population.
<P>
     Notwithstanding the success of high-impact operations like the
one in Philadelphia, Members of Congress should be cautious about
continuing to expand federal jurisdiction. Once again, virtually all
violent crime enforcement falls upon state, not federal authorities,
and there is an ample menu of specific policy initiatives that state
officials can pursue in controlling violent crime. Former Attorney
General William Barr has outlined two dozen specific recommendations
that would help state officials combat violent crime. (For an
excellent and detailed discussion of the Barr recommendations to state
and local officials, see Mary Kate Cary, "How States Can Fight Violent
Crime: Two Dozen Steps to a Safer America," Heritage Foundation State
Backgrounder No. 944/S, June 7, 1993.)
<P>
     There are several other reasons why Members of Congress should be
cautious in expanding the federal role in combatting domestic street
crime.
<P>
     First, limited resources will not permit greater involvement by
federal law enforcement. Generally lost in all of President Clinton's
rhetoric about fighting crime are his significant cutbacks in federal
law enforcement. There are hundreds fewer agents and prosecutors now
than there were in the Bush Administration. Moreover, the President's
proposed budget for FY 1995 seeks to cut prison construction by 30
percent (adding to a sharp cut in 1994) and Department of Justice law
enforcement agencies by 1,523 positions. Former Deputy Attorney
General Philip Heymann summarized the Clinton Administration's policy
by stating that, "With fewer federal investigators and fewer federal
prosecutors in the years ahead there will not be more federal law
enforcement but less.... " (Philip B. Heymann, "The Lock-'em-up
Debate; What Pols Won't Say: 3 Strikes -- And We're Out of Money," The
Washington Post, February 27, 1994, p. C1. ) It would be misleading
for Congress to expand the federal role in law enforcement while
following the lead of the Clinton Administration by slashing the
resources of these law enforcement agencies. Meaningless rhetoric on
the crime issue only adds to the taxpayer's discouragement with
government; both Members of Congress and state legislators should
recall that the first duty of government is to protect American
citizens, not simply to talk tough about crime. 
<P>
      Second, Congress should avoid passing laws that continue to
undermine the distinction between federal and state jurisdiction
regarding street crime. Given the independent nature of United States
Attorneys, it is likely that some would attempt to operate like local
district attorneys. Furthermore, elimination of the federal-state
distinction runs counter to the notion of a limited federal government
acting only in accordance with enumerated powers. While such a
traditional notion of constitutional law is hardly the guiding
influence of Washington's current policy-making process, the loss of
even more ground in this area must be avoided.
<P>

<B> ENDING STATE DEATH PENALTIES </B>
<P>
     The third question that Members of Congress must resolve pertains
to the imposition of capital punishment at the state level. By the
slimmest of margins, the House passed the so-called Racial Justice
Act, which purports to remedy racial bias in the administration of
state death penalties but which actually would end the death penalty
not just for future cases, but also for all offenders currently under
sentence of death.
<P>
     According to the provisions of this remarkable proposal, if a
defendant offers statistical information indicating a disparity
between the race of the offender or the victim in a capital case and
the racial composition of the general community, a presumption of
racial bias is established. At this point, the prosecutor must prove
there was no discrimination. In other words -- in violation of the
canons of logical debate -- the government must prove a negative. Even
if evidence is presented that is relevant to the government's reason
for seeking the death sentence, it will not respond fully to the
possibility that racial prejudice was an additional factor. Moreover,
the prosecutor must do this retroactively, recovering evidence from
potentially thousands of cases dating back to the re-establishment of
capital punishment in 1976. Prosecutors agree that this measure will
lead to an injustice far worse than the one its sponsors now think
exists. To avoid the statistical disparity which triggers the
presumption of bias, the government will be forced to keep track of
the racial composition of offenders and victims and to make sure that
such composition matches that of the local community. This quota
system is completely contrary to the basic principles of the American
criminal justice system: that justice is color-blind and that every
case must be judged on its own merits.
<P>
     If Members of Congress accept this proposal, they will further
damage the criminal justice system. Even worse, the realization by
citizens and state law enforcement officials that Congress has imposed
this system on them, it will further erode the credibility of Congress
as an effective institution of government, underscoring the difference
between the tough rhetoric of Congress's latest war on crime and the
legislative reality of its latest anti-crime package.
<P>

<B> CONCLUSION </B>
<P>
     To craft a truly effective anti-crime policy, Members of Congress
ideally would need to start from scratch, beginning with the
recognition that state legislators have primary responsibility for
fighting violent street crime. Streamlining the court systems,
enacting rational sentencing laws, and improving the quality of police
recruiting and police detection of crime are all within the
jurisdiction of the several states.
<P>
     A serious federal anti-crime policy would have as its main focus
the elimination of every form of federal interference in the crucial
mission of public safety by the states. Through unfunded mandates that
consume their scarce fiscal resources, the federal government forces
states to divert funds from public safety. Because of activist federal
judges who micro-manage state prison systems and continually grant new
legal opportunities to death row inmates, states remain handcuffed in
their struggle against violent criminals. These are the problems that
should be addressed in federal anti-crime legislation.
<P>
     In the meantime, Congress can salvage good policy in a measure
that otherwise holds little promise of reducing the violence on
America's streets. First, in apportioning federal funds, Congress
should set aside not less than $10 billion as an incentive fund for
the states to encourage sentencing reform. States must stop revolving
door justice by increasing the amount of time served by violent
criminals from the current 38 percent to something much closer to 100
percent. Second, not one dime should be spent on more misguided social
welfare programs. Members of Congress should reject the advice of
those who still insist, despite two decades worth of evidence to the
contrary, that violent criminals also are victims of society to be
helped through more social spending. It is time for Members of
Congress to start listening to the real victims of violent crime.

<h3>
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE BROOKS AND BIDEN CRIME BILLS </h3>

By Paul J. McNulty<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><Br>

Issues Bulletin No. 184<br>
November 8, 1993<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>


<B> INTRODUCTION </B>
<P>
     The fear and frustration gripping America because of violent
crime is the direct result of one tragic fact. A dysfunctional
criminal justice system continues to release extremely dangerous
career criminals into the community when they should still be in
prison. The common factor in nearly every violent crime receiving
widespread publicity, including the recent murders of Florida tourists
and the killing of basketball star Michael Jordan's father, is that
the suspects were previously convicted of violent crimes, yet had soon
been permitted to return to the streets. Arrest, conviction, and
imprisonment did not stop them. (Half of all current state prisoners,
approximately 350,000 inmates, have three prior felony convictions,
"Survey of State Prison Inmates, 1991," Bureau of Justice Statistics,
U.S. Department of Justice.)
<P>
     This is why President Bill Clinton's plan to combat violent
crime, now being considered by Congress, completely misses the mark.
The main features of the President's plan are contained in legislation
offered in the House (H.R. 3131) by Jack Brooks, the Texas Democrat,
who is Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and in the Senate
(S. 1488, S. 1607) by Joseph Biden, the Delaware Democrat, who heads
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
<P>
     The House and Senate bills supported by Clinton ignore the real
problem by merely proposing to:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Add only 60,000 more police across the entire country over the
     next six or more years;
<P>
     Control gun possession for everyone except violent criminals, for
     whom getting guns will remain easy;
<P>
     Overturn landmark Supreme Court decisions favorable to law
     enforcement;
<P>
     Offer more spending promises, amidst a deficit crisis, on
     programs for non-violent offenders and unnecessary study
     commissions; and
<P>
     Establish softer penalties than President Bush's plan would have
     done for gun crimes by violent criminals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Yet the Brooks and Biden bills do not target the root cause of
the wave of violent crime -- the career criminals who are not kept off
the streets. Among the most serious problems with these bills and the
Clinton plan:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> One-third of Clinton's promised new police positions are not for
     police officers at all, and many others will not be available for
     many years. Moreover, the bills do not indicate where the money
     for community policing positions will come from. And more police
     to deter crime in some neighborhoods is no substitute for longer
     incarceration of career criminals.
<P>
     The bills authorize billions of dollars for "boot camps" and
     other "alternative" punishments, and for drug treatment programs
     within prison walls. Yet drug treatment programs show limited
     effectiveness, and money spent on treatment and alternative
     punishment means less money available for building prison space
     to keep career violent criminals off the streets.
<P>
     While they increase the number of crimes subject to the federal
     death penalty, the bills contain death penalty procedures that
     will make it difficult, if not impossible, to impose the death
     penalty.
<P>
     The bills contain habeas corpus reforms that likely will spur
     more petitions, not fewer.
<P>
     The Brooks bill would automatically give a violent criminal a new
     trial when an invalid confession was used in the original trial,
     even if such use had a harmless effect.
<P>
     The bills drop all the mandatory minimum sentence provisions for
     serious firearms offenders that were contained in last year's
     crime bill, and S. 1607 repeals mandatory sentences for certain
     drug offenders.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 <P>    Competing Republican measures avoid these deficiencies. These
bills, based on the original Bush crime bill introduced last year,
would, among other things, spend $3 billion over the next three years
on new regional prisons to house the most dangerous violent criminals.
These alternative bills recognize that only a partnership between
federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies which targets the
most dangerous criminals, particularly those who use firearms, and
removes them from the streets will give Americans real security from
the threat of violent crime.
<P>

<B> A DECADE OF WEAK CRIME LEGISLATION </B>
<P>
     Congress is frequently accused of being enmeshed in gridlock,
unable to produce legislation on important matters of public policy.
When it comes to crime legislation, however, this criticism is seldom
heard. Indeed, anti-crime legislation has been a consistent exception
to Congress's "productivity" problem over the past decade. On this
subject, there has been no lack of desire or ability to produce new
laws. 
<P>
     Lawmakers have responded to the public's growing fear of crime by
passing four major federal crime bills in less than a decade. (The
Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of
1986, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, and the Crime Control Act of
1990.) A fifth bill came within a few votes of reaching President
Bush's desk last year. Together these bills have added hundreds of new
crimes, penalties, and procedures to the U.S. Code. Most
significantly, the combined effect of this legislation, coupled with a
dramatic increase in the federal law enforcement budget, (Spending for
federal law enforcement rose by nearly 60 percent in the Bush
Administration.) has greatly expanded the role of the federal
government in the fight against violent crime and drug trafficking.
<P>

<B> The Truth Behind the Signing Ceremonies
</B><P>
     Despite this apparent agreement between Republicans and Democrats
on the importance of fighting crime and drug abuse, sharp differences
have remained unresolved on the most important criminal justice
issues. A bipartisan coalition of moderate and conservative members in
both houses still has been unsuccessful during the past decade in
winning passage of their three top priorities. These are a
comprehensive federal death penalty, habeas corpus reform (limiting
repetitious legal challenges by death row inmates), and exclusionary
rule reform (by allowing in-court use of evidence seized without a
warrant by police officers acting in good faith).
<P>
     These three reforms so far have been blocked by a small liberal
group of highly influential lawmakers despite the support for the
measures by large majorities in both houses of Congress. The group has
been able to do this because they are high-ranking members of the
House and Senate Judiciary Committees. For example, on several
occasions over the past ten years, proposals to reform the
exclusionary rule have been adopted by the House, and habeas corpus
reform amendments have won approval in the Senate. Yet with the
exception of the death penalty for murderous drug traffickers, a
narrowly tailored provision that was passed in 1988, no amendment
concerning these three major issues has ever survived a House-Senate
conference. 
<P>

<B> The New Strategy </B>
<P>
     Apparently fearing that their blocking tactics might no longer be
successful, the Judiciary Committee liberals devised a new strategy in
1991. Rather than relying solely on obstruction, they offered their
own versions of these proposals. Their legislation had the same titles
as the anti-crime amendments, but in reality were quite different.
What was called habeas corpus reform, for example, turned out to be a
plan to gut current law by overturning more than a dozen Supreme Court
decisions which had established some limitations on habeas corpus
petitions. 
<P>
     In the end, the strategy worked. Many Members of Congress and the
media became so confused by the complicated legal debates over the
differing proposals that they did not appreciate the real effect of
the measures. As a result, in 1991, the Senate agreed to a "reform" of
the exclusionary rule offered by Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph
Biden. This amendment actually restricted, not expanded, the current
admissibility of certain evidence. Later that year a liberal version
of habeas corpus reform passed the House by a few votes. Judiciary
Committee Democrats wasted no time in crafting a conference report
containing these destructive amendments, among other anti-law
enforcement proposals. President Bush fiercely opposed the conference
report and announced he would veto it if it was not significantly
amended. As a result, this "crime bill" died in the Senate in 1992
after several attempts to overcome a threatened Republican filibuster.
<P>
     This is the same crime bill that President Clinton has endorsed
and now serves as the core of H.R. 3131, introduced by Representative
Jack Brooks, and S. 1488 and S. 1607, introduced by Senator Joseph
Biden.
<P>
     Unlike Presidents Reagan and Bush, President Clinton has chosen
not to transmit to Congress an actual legislative proposal. Instead,
he held a press conference this August at which he outlined five
components of crime legislation that Congress should approve. The
crime bills introduced by the Chairmen of the House and Senate
Judiciary Committees largely include the President's five elements.
<P>
     The President chose this unusual course for two apparent reasons.
First, his support for the 1992 crime bill conference report made it
unnecessary to fashion a new bill from scratch. Any new ideas, such as
grants for more police, could simply be added to the 1992 bill.
Second, forming a new bill would have required the agreement of at
least four parties -- the White House, the Justice Department,
moderate Democrats such as Senator Biden and Representative Charles
Schumer, the New York Democrat who is Chairman of the Subcommittee on
Crime and Criminal Justice of the House Judiciary Committee, and
liberal Democrats such as Senator Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio and
Representative Don Edwards of California, who is Chairman of the
Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights. Given Attorney
General Janet Reno's personal opposition to the death penalty and her
preference for social programs addressing the "root causes" of crime,
agreement on a new crime bill would have been extremely difficult. By
deferring to the preferences of Chairmen Brooks and Biden, the
President at least temporarily avoided a clash within his own party. 
<P>

 <B> THE PRESIDENT'S FIVE PRIORITIES </B>
<P>
     President Clinton has called on Congress to pass a crime bill
containing at least the following five elements:
<P>
1.   More Police;
<P>
2.   Gun Control;
<P>
3.   Boot Camps and Drug Treatment;
<P>
4.   Federal Death Penalty; and
<P>
5.   Habeas Corpus Reform

<P>



<B> Element #1: More Police </B>
<P>
     Putting 100,000 more police on America's streets was the
centerpiece of candidate Clinton's anti-crime message during his
presidential campaign. This promise apparently was well received by
the voters. Even though George Bush had an exceptionally strong record
on law enforcement, he did not maintain an edge over Clinton on the
crime issue -- in contrast with Bush's battle with Michael Dukakis in
1988.
<P>
     The President's plan for adding 100,000 police includes the
following specifics:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> An additional 50,000 new officers over the next six years in
     community policing programs, at a cost to the federal government
     (in addition to state and local costs) of $3.4 billion (Senator
     Biden increased this to 60,000 officers and $5.2 billion in S.
     1607;
<P>
     Between 4,000 and 5,000 "Police Corps" officers after 1999, when
     they complete four years of government-supported college
     education (The federal government's cost: $100 million);
<P>
     An additional 4,000 security guards and police officers for
     public schools over five years, at a federal cost of $475
     million;
<P>
     An additional 5,000 security guards and police officers for
     public housing over five years at a federal cost of $700 million;
<P>
     Up to 25,000 "National Service" participants (college students)
     working in law enforcement-related fields for one or two years;
<P>
     Between 6,000 and 7,000 officers for community policing in
     "Empowerment Zones" and "Enterprise Communities," at a cost to
     the federal government of $500 million; and
<P>
     An additional $10 million for the Labor Department to retrain up
     to 1,500 former military personnel for police positions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Analysis: The Administration argues that more police will
suppress crime because criminals are less willing to break the law in
the presence of police officers. More suppression means less crime and
fewer arrests, which will alleviate some of the burden currently
weighing down the criminal justice system.
  <P>   Supporters of the President's plan also point out that community
policing, in particular, has become an extremely useful program for
developing stronger ties between police and the communities they
serve. The visible presence of law enforcement officers "walking the
beat" not only discourages potential law breakers, but it also gives a
sense of security to citizens.
<P>
     A closer examination of this proposal, however, reveals at least
the following three serious flaws:
<P>
Flaw #1: It is too little, too late. As much as one-third of the
proposed 100,000 new positions
     are not police officers. The list includes up to 35,000 unsworn
     security personnel and "National Service" students who are
     serving one or two years in public safety organizations to pay
     back college loans. These individuals are not authorized to make
     arrests, and most will not be engaged in confrontations with
     criminals. This is hardly what Americans expected when they
     expressed strong support for more "cops on the beat."
     Furthermore, approximately 5,000 of the new police officers who
     would come from the Police Corps program will not be on the job
     until 1999 at the earliest, because they must complete four years
     of college education before they begin service. 
<P>
Flaw #2: The money may come from other law enforcement programs. There
is a big difference
     between an authorization to spend money for state and local law
     enforcement and an actual appropriations bill containing the
     funding. The President's proposal would merely give permission to
     congressional appropriators to search for some extra money to
     fund the police programs. The Brooks and Biden bills propose
     nearly $3.4 billion to $5.2 billion over five or six years for
     just half of the 100,000 police jobs, and there are several other
     expensive provisions in the bills. Yet, federal funding for state
     and local anti-crime grants have been frozen at slightly less
     than $500 million for the past three years. So if Congress is to
     expand the level of financial assistance for state and local
     government without violating its overall budget constraints, the
     money likely will have to come from the federal law enforcement
     budget -- which has already been targeted by the Clinton
     Administration for sharp reductions.
<P>
Flaw #3: More police alone will not keep criminals off the streets.
Perhaps the most significant
     flaw with merely promising more police is that it fails to
     address the real problem. Suppressing crime through more police
     seeks to stop crime the same way locks on doors, bars on windows,
     citizen patrols, and anti-car theft devices do. They reduce the
     opportunities for criminals. But there is a hard core of career
     criminals on the streets; they are not easily deterred, and they
     are the main cause of the crime wave. As long as they continue to
     be released from prison long before their sentences have been
     served, Americans will not enjoy genuine security. To keep these
     criminals off the streets -- rather than merely dissuade them
     from operating in certain neighborhoods -- requires more
     prosecutors, judges, and prisons.
<P>
     With more police on the streets, more arrests will and should be
made. This places an increased burden on the courts, prosecutors, and
prisons. But the President ignores the entire criminal justice
pipeline. Ironically, when the system receives more offenders than it
can handle, more offenders must be "let off" in various ways (such as
dropped charges, plea bargains, and probation). Criminals then can
return to the streets with greater confidence in their ability to
"beat the system." 

<P>
<B> Element #2: Gun Control </B>
<P>
     The second element of the President's anti-crime plan is gun
control. Clinton has challenged Congress to enact the Brady Bill, a
proposal named after President Reagan's Press Secretary, James Brady,
which would establish a national waiting period for background checks
of handgun purchasers. He also has proposed a ban on the importation,
manufacture, sale, and possession of so-called assault weapons.
Analysis: The debate over the Brady Bill, which is a provision of the
Brooks bill only, is largely a symbolic one. Those supporting the
Brady bill are cast as being "for" a tough measure to deny guns to
criminals. Those opposing the bill are said to be "against" that goal.
<P>
     In reality, the legislative differences between the gun control
and the anti-gun control forces are minor. The Brady Bill would
establish a five working-day waiting period for the purchase of a
handgun, during which time local law enforcement officials would be
able to conduct background checks on the prospective gun buyers. These
checks would include a search of the criminal history records
currently available to law enforcement agencies at the state and
federal levels. 
<P>
     Major improvements in the automation and accuracy of these
criminal history records would permit fast and reliable access. When
this is achieved, or after five years, whichever is sooner, the Brady
Bill's waiting period requirement would sunset, because by that time a
background check could be conducted almost instantly. Lawmakers
opposed to the Brady Bill favor an instant check system. Their
proposal calls for the development of an automated system over the
next five years for determining, at the time the handgun is being
sold, whether the buyer is a convicted felon. The only difference is
that no national waiting period would exist during this period of
time.
<P>
     Since many Americans already live in jurisdictions with either a
waiting period or some other preferred method to screen gun buyers,
the actual effect of the Brady Bill would be minimal. The real
difference between the two sides has more to do with underlying
philosophies for dealing with violent crime. Many gun control
supporters believe crime is the result of the environment within which
criminals live. They cite such factors as the availability of guns,
television violence, and economic and educational deprivation. The
anti-gun control proponents, on the other hand, are more interested in
the accountability of the violent criminal.
<P>
     In the case of a ban on assault weapons, the 101st and the 102nd
Congresses dealt with this issue at great length. Assault weapons, as
defined by past legislation, are the semi-automatic firearms popular
with violent criminals because of their menacing appearance. Among the
features of such weapons are folding stocks, pistol grips, large
ammunition clips, and bayonet attachments.
<P>
     The controversy over the proposal to ban the weapons arises from
the inability to define, to the satisfaction of most lawmakers, the
words "assault weapons." Aside from their appearance, assault weapons
actually are no different from any other semi-automatic firearm. The
simple fact is that all semi-automatic firearms function in the same
way. Opponents argue that a ban might eventually and easily be
expanded to include many more popular types of semi-automatics, such
as widely owned target shooting and hunting rifles.
<P>
     So strong is this objection that neither the Brooks nor the Biden
bill includes a proposal on assault weapons.
<P>
<B> Element #3: Boot Camps and Drug Treatment </B>
<P>
     The third component of President Clinton's anti-crime plan is an
expansion of boot camps and drug treatment for prisoners. The Brooks
and Biden bills authorize $600 million and $800 million respectively
in new spending for "boot camps" and other "alternative punishments"
at the state level. The bills also propose "residential drug
treatment" grants of $300 million over three years for state prisons,
and they require federal prisons by 1997 to provide drug treatment to
every prisoner with a substance abuse problem. State prisoners under
the age of 29 would be eligible for the alternative punishments
programs even if they are violent criminals.
Analysis: The shortage of federal funding for state law enforcement
programs is by far the biggest problem with the boot camps and drug
treatment proposals. The President has said that funding for more
police is his top priority. But there will be difficulty in finding
money even for that, let alone these other measures. It is very
doubtful, therefore, that any money will be available in practice for
these new projects. Law enforcement officials at the state and local
level will be particularly irritated if funding for drug treatment is
taken from programs that support their anti-crime efforts. 
 <P>    The provision concerning residential drug treatment for federal
prisoners raises a more serious funding problem. This section requires
the federal Bureau of Prisons to provide by 1997 the opportunity for
residential drug treatment to every prisoner with a substance abuse
problem. By the end of fiscal year 1995, at least 50 percent of this
goal must be achieved, and by the end of 1996, the requirement
increases to 75 percent. If Congress does not provide additional
funding to the Bureau for this mandate, other Bureau programs may
suffer --  such as prison construction, which already has felt
substantial reductions.
<P>
     As for drug treatment grants to the states, it is important to
note that treatment for prisoners already is widely available. A third
of all state inmates have participated in drug treatment programs
while in prison, and among those who had used a drug during the month
before their current offense, nearly half received treatment after
entering prison. ("Survey of State Prison Inmates, 1991," Bureau of
Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice.)
<P>
     While some may argue that this is short of what is needed, it
must also be understood that treatment is often unsuccessful. A 1991
survey of state prisoners who had used drugs during the month before
their crime, for example, found that 31 percent had been in treatment
before and 25 percent had been in it twice. (Ibid.) Moreover, the
prospect of serving prison time in a "residential treatment" program,
defined as confinement "set apart from the general prison population,"
may have the effect, at both the federal and state level, of drawing
prisoners who are marginally in need of treatment but attracted to the
"soft time."
<P>
     Finally, some serious consideration should be given to the
proposal that federal tax dollars be used for putting young violent
offenders into "alternative" corrections programs. Releasing such
criminals into community-based programs poses real risks to public
safety.

<P>
<B> Element #4: The Death Penalty </B>
<P>
     The President has called for the enactment of a comprehensive
federal death penalty as his fourth priority. He supports the 1992
crime bill death penalty language that contained more than fifty
capital offenses. The Biden and Brooks bills have slightly fewer
offenses because the death penalty for drug kingpins was dropped from
both bills at the insistence of the Justice Department. The reason is
that the provision would have permitted the death penalty for a major
drug kingpin convicted solely of trafficking extremely large
quantities of drugs. No proof of a specific murder would have been
required.
<P>
     Analysis: One criticism often leveled against a federal death
penalty is that it is largely symbolic because nearly all murders are
in violation of state law and fall outside federal jurisdiction.
Indeed, many of the federal capital offenses found in H.R. 3131,
S. 1488, and S. 1607 are extremely limited in their reach, such as
terrorist murders or assassination of the President. However, a few of
the offenses in the Biden and Brooks bills could apply widely. For
example, imposing the death penalty for killing with a firearm in the
course of a federal violent crime or serious drug trafficking offense
could apply to much of the violence now occurring on the streets of
nearly every city in America.
<P>
     This proposal does prompt objections among those concerned about
principles of federalism. The aggressive use of such a federal death
penalty would tend to lead to a more frequent use of the death penalty
in states where capital punishment rarely, if ever, occurs. Thus a
state reluctant to impose the death penalty would, in effect, be
overriden by the federal government.
<P>
     Federalists need not worry, however, about the Democrats' death
penalty proposal. Capital punishment at the federal level will occur
only when the statutory procedures allow. And the Biden and Brooks
bills contain death penalty procedures that will make it difficult, if
not impossible, actually to impose a death sentence.
<P>
     First, the bills allow for "standardless jury discretion." This
means that any juror can block the sentence of death, regardless of
how aggravated the crime may have been. This is inconsistent with
current law, which permits juries to be instructed that a death
sentence must be imposed if they determine that the aggravating
factors outweigh the mitigating factors. (See Boyde v. California, 110
S.Ct. 1190 (1990) and Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 110 S.Ct. 1078
(1990).) 
<P>
     Second, the procedures contain no habeas corpus limitations.
Thus, federal capital defendants can endlessly delay their executions,
as most state prisoners currently do. The habeas reform proposals in
H.R. 3131, S. 1488, and S. 1607, as ineffective as they are, apply
only to state prisoners. 
<P>
     Third, the bills prohibit federal prosecutors from using elements
of an offense as aggravating factors. As an example, consider a case
of a person convicted of murdering a child in the course of violating
the federal law against child sexual abuse. Under the Brooks and Biden
bills, the government could not use the fact that the victim was a
child as an aggravating factor -- contrary to current law. (See
Lowenfeld v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231 (1988).)
<P>
<B> Element #5: Habeas Corpus Reform </B>
<P>
     The last element of the President's anti-crime package is habeas
corpus reform. In his August statement, the President drew attention
to a bill introduced by Senator Biden which is now incorporated into
S. 1488 and S. 1607. He described the bill as a "breakthrough" because
it enjoys the support of district attorneys, state attorneys general,
as well as Administration officials. The President characterized the
Biden proposal as one which "will, for the first time, limit inmates
to filing a single, federal habeas corpus appeal within a six month
time limit." It will also, he said, require death penalty states to
provide every indigent capital defendant with a team of highly
qualified and experienced defense lawyers.
<P>
     The Brooks bill also contains a habeas corpus proposal, which
differs in some important aspects from the Biden version. One key
difference is that H.R. 3131 substantially expands the control and
influence of activist criminal defense lawyers in matters relating to
the representation of indigent capital defendants.
Analysis: The battle over habeas corpus reform in recent years has
been extremely complex and divisive. At its root, the debate is about
the extent and nature of federal court review of actions by state
criminal justice systems, actions which involve difficult legal and
constitutional questions. It is divisive because in many cases it is
also about life and death. 
  <P>  The primary goal for supporters of habeas corpus reform is to
limit significantly the ability of prisoners on death row to delay the
imposition of capital punishment by raising frivolous legal claims in
federal courts. The Biden and Brooks bills apply to non-capital cases
as well. The current system allows such prisoners to attack their
convictions by repeatedly filing federal habeas corpus petitions,
requesting federal judges to review their cases after they have lost
all of their direct appeals and their state-level habeas corpus
claims. These filings can result in years of delay, and consume
enormous amounts of the time, energy, and money of the already over-
burdened legal system.
<P>
     Senator Biden deserves credit for initiating negotiations with
prosecutors in crafting his habeas corpus proposal. One result of this
is that representatives of the National District Attorneys Association
and some state attorneys general have expressed support for his bill.
However, a growing number of state prosecutors are expressing
opposition to the language, now that they have fully examined what
their Washington representatives achieved. (California Attorney
General Dan Lungren is leading the drive to defeat the Democrats'
habeas corpus proposal.)
<P>
     The objections to the Biden and Brooks bills are that they not
only fall far short of what is needed to end habeas corpus abuse, but
they also dramatically weaken existing law. The claim is that habeas
corpus abuse would be worse, not better, if these proposals became
law. The bills broaden the legal basis on which habeas claims could be
made, make it easier to file a second, third, or fourth petition than
it is today, and mandate the states to bear large costs in providing
to indigent capital defendants the best defense attorneys available in
all phases of capital litigation.
<P>
     Retroactive Decisions. Under current law, a convicted criminal is
generally unable to challenge his conviction based upon subsequent
changes in the law. "New rules" are not normally retroactive to past
cases. The Supreme Court announced this in the 1989 landmark case of
Teague v. Lane, (489 U.S. 288 (1989). ) in which the Court held that a
defendant's claims of constitutional violations in most cases must be
judged in accordance with the law existing at the time his conviction
became final. Without such a principle, the Court explained, appellate
judges would have to be prophets and there would never be finality in
the criminal justice system. All of this means that a prisoner may not
challenge his conviction in a habeas corpus petition on the grounds
that the Supreme Court has established a "new rule" in a particular
area of the law that may be relevant to the prisoner's original case.
<P>
     Reversing Teague through federal legislation, or at least
substantially reducing its effect, has been a top goal of Democratic
leaders on Capitol Hill for the past few years. The aim has been to
define by statute "new rule" in a manner that is narrower than the
definition in Teague and later cases. Achieving this change would mean
that many more decisions would be retroactive to past cases, allowing
prisoners new opportunities to overturn their convictions using habeas
petitions.
<P>
     New Grounds for Petition. Since the primary purpose of habeas
corpus reform is to drastically limit the ability of a prisoner to
file a second or successive petition following disposition of the
first, any exception to this "one bite" rule would have to be minor.
President Bush proposed that such petitions be permitted only when
they raised constitutional claims involving new evidence of actual
innocence. But the Clinton approach, embodied in the Biden and Brooks
bills, is very different.
<P>
     New petitions would be permitted under several circumstances.
Among them: 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> A retroactive Supreme Court decision which changes the law in
     existence at the time the prisoner's case became final;
<P>
     The emergence of new evidence, such as a relative's affidavit
     asserting an alibi for the petitioner, even if it is unrelated to
     a violation of constitutional rights; and
<P>     The discovery of additional evidence relating to mitigation
     against the sentence of death. (This is a direct repudiation of
     the 1992 Supreme Court decision in Sawyer v. Whitley, (112 S.Ct.
     2514, (1992).) which held that successive habeas petitions may
     not attack a sentence of death on the basis of new mitigating
     factors.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     New Standards for Defense Counsel. California Attorney General
Daniel Lungren refers to the lengthy provisions involving mandatory
standards for defense lawyers as the "Capital Defense Attorney
Employment Act of 1993." He rightly objects to the new federal
standards being forced on the states even though they are not required
by the Constitution. Moreover, the proposal establishes mandatory
standards on state trials and appeals, not just federal habeas
proceedings, and, in the case of H.R. 3131 and S. 1488, cuts off law
enforcement funding for states that do not "choose" to comply.
<P>
<B> OTHER BIDEN-BROOKS CRIME BILL PROPOSALS </B>
<P>
     There are several other problems with H.R. 3131, S. 1488, and S.
1607. Two provisions are particularly in need of modification:
<P>
1.   Repeal of the Harmless Error Rules. H.R. 3131 overturns Arizona
     v. Fulminante (111 S.Ct. 1246, (1991).) and possibly other
     "harmless error" cases. In Fulminante, the Supreme Court held
     that a criminal conviction should not be reversed when a
     defendant's invalid confession was admitted into evidence if it
     appears beyond a reasonable doubt that without the confession the
     other evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant. H.R. 3131
     would require convictions in such cases automatically to be
     reversed for new trials.
<P>
2.   Deletion of Mandatory Minimum Sentences: Mandatory minimum
     sentences have become an issue of great controversy. The debate
     usually focuses on the wisdom of mandatory sentences for certain
     types of drug offenders. The Biden and Brooks bills go much
     further by dropping all the proposals for new mandatory sentences
     for serious firearm offenders that were contained in last year's
     crime bill. For example, the 1992 crime bill contained a ten-year
     mandatory minimum sentence for anyone who used a semi-automatic
     firearm in the course of a violent crime or serious drug
     trafficking offense. H.R. 3131, S. 1488 and S. 1607 do not
     contain this proposal. Instead they simply instruct the
     Sentencing Commission to "provide an appropriate enhancement" for
     this offense. Furthermore, S. 1607 repeals mandatory minimum
     sentences for non-violent drug traffickers. This could
     substantially weaken the ability of federal prosecutors to obtain
     the cooperation of such offenders because they would no longer
     have an incentive to provide valuable information regarding
     trafficking conspiracies.

<P>
<B> REPUBLICAN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS </B>
<P>
     The Republican leadership in both the Senate and the House began
working on violent crime bills in the spring of this year, and
introduced their comprehensive plans in early August. Large parts of
the bills (H.R. 2872 and S. 1356) look very much like the proposals
transmitted to Congress by President Bush on two occasions during his
Administration. The strength of these bills is that they contain both
important reforms for the federal system and incentives for system
reforms at the state evel.
<P>
     The provisions in these bills dealing with the federal death
penalty, habeas corpus reform, and the exclusionary rule contain none
of the flaws found in H.R. 3131 and S. 1488. The measures also include
proposals that would have a significant effect on the ability of
federal and state prosecutors to convict criminals committing acts of
sexual violence.
<P>
     A major provision in the Republican bills deals with regional
prisons. The bills propose to spend $3 billion over the next three
years to build and operate large regional prisons. This would be
undertaken in financial partnerships with groups of states. In a
contrast to normal congressional practice, the Republicans also
explain how they would pay for the prisons by identifying specific
spending cuts.
<P>
     These new prisons would be used to house criminal aliens and
certain categories of the most dangerous violent criminals currently
located in state prisons. For a state to be eligible to participate in
this program, it must demonstrate its commitment to combatting violent
crime by reforming its criminal justice system. The key reform is so-
called truth-in-sentencing, which means that violent criminals and
serious drug traffickers must serve at least 85 percent of their
sentences.
<P>

<B> CONCLUSION

     The anti-crime plans offered by President Clinton and
congressional Democrats will do nothing to address the wave of violent
crime now plaguing America. At best, these plans offer unfunded
promises to state and local law enforcement. Given the pressing need
for additional resources throughout the criminal justice system, such
empty-handed promises cannot be viewed as acceptable solutions. 
<P>
     Beyond the hollow nature of these proposals lies the damage that
would be done when the criminal justice system is weakened by
provisions overturning Supreme Court decisions favorable to law
enforcement. If Congress were to enact these provisions, it would be a
major setback for crime control. Instead, Congress should adopt
measures that would remove violent criminals from America's streets.

<h3>ON THE FIRING LINE: CLINTON'S CRIME BILL</h3><P>
<b>By David B. Kopel</b><br>
Associate Policy Analyst, Cato Institute<br>
September 24, 1993<br>
<P>

What a thrill to be invited to speak at the Heritage
Foundation. I still remember that December day in 1979 when I saw
a little boxed ad for Policy Review tucked in one of the back pages
of Commentary. I asked my parents to buy me a subscription as a
Christmas present. The magazine had a profound effect on my
thinking, even as I was a Congressional intern for Representative
Pat Schroeder. 
<P>
     President Clinton was elected partly because he sold himself
as a New Democrat who was tough on crime. Almost everyone in
this room considers himself or herself to be tough on crime, as
a former New York prosecutor, I certainly share that viewpoint. So
is there anything that we can find to like in the proposed Clinton
crime bill. While the bill has a few virtues, it is on the whole
dangerous to public safety, both in the short and the long term.
<P>
Prior Restraint on Self-Defense. Let's start with the Brady Bill. Other than professional employees of the gun control lobby and New York City Mayor David Dinkins, I don't know anyone who seriously thinks this proposal is going to have a major impact on crime. I doubt thateven President Clinton expects it to have much of an effect. Accordingly, the fact that the Brady
Bill stands as the centerpiece of the Clinton crime bill is one indication that the bill is more aboutpolitics than about crime control.
<P>
     Here's how the Brady Bill works, in its present draft. When a person wishes to buy a handgun from a gun dealer, the dealer sends a notification to the local police. The local police have the option of conducting a background check of any type on the buyer, but there is no requirement for any background. After five government working days have elapsed, the dealer
may sell the handgun if the police have not vetoed the sale.
<P>
     As a practical matter of course, the dealer won't release the gun until he receives positive authorization from the police, even if the authorization takes months to come through. The risk of tort liability is simply too high. As a result, we can expect to see situations similar to that in New Jersey, where the statutory 30-day waiting period currently lasts for  several months, or New York City, where the statutory 6 month waiting period lasts nearly a year.
<P>
     If, rather than failing to act, the police simply veto the sale, the buyer has no legal recourse. If the sale was vetoed because the buyer was incorrectly mistaken for a person with the same last name who has a criminal record, or the sale was vetoed because the police chief doesn't like racial minorities, or because the police chief doesn't like anybody owning handguns, there is no legal recourse. There is no appeal from the police decision, and lawsuits based on the police decision are specifically forbidden.  In Maryland, where an appeals process exists, the
police are overruled on 78% of appeals.
<P>
     This practice of Handgun Control, Incorporated -- of repeatedly placing such clauses in legislation which appears relatively mild on the surface -- suggests that the group has more on its hidden agenda than moderate controls on handguns. In New Jersey, for example, the ban on so-called assault weapons even outlawed BB guns. 
<P>
     The real point of the Brady Bill is not that it has anything to do with crime control. Rather, it is accurately described by proponents and opponents alike as the first step towards much more restrictive gun controls. In a recent issue of the New York Times, Mrs. Brady explained that she expects the Brady Bill to pave the way for a need-based gun licensing system. By federal law, every transfer of every gun of any type, including the gift of a  old .22 single-shot rifle from father-in-law to son-in-law, would be permitted only if the local police determined that the recipient needed the particular gun. Based on the policies that Handgun Control, Inc. has supported in cities such as Washington and New York, if the police administration decided that nobody needed a gun for protection, or that nobody needed a handgun for any purpose, or that nobody needed a shotgun which could hold more than two shells, the police would have absolute discretion to prohibit the gun transfer.
<P>
     That gun prohibition advocates would support that Brady Bill component of the President's crime bill is not surprising. What is more disturbing is the support that the bill often receives from conservatives. For example, William F. Buckley suggests that the Brady Bill be enacted as a national gesture of our concern about violent crime. But of course one of the reasons
we have so much violent crime is that our political culture has tolerated and our politicians have readily indulged in empty, symbolic gestures, rather than genuine crime control.
<P>
     Some conservatives suggest that the Brady Bill be enacted because the public wants it, or because police lobbyists want it,  as if police or public sentiment could ever justify the infringement of Constitutional rights. And besides, the only polls that show support for the Brady
Bill are those that don't compare the Brady Bill with the NRA alternative. When people  compare the Brady Bill ( a waiting period with no background check) to the NRA alternative (a mandatory computerized check at the point of purchase), the public overwhelmingly prefers the NRA instant check.
<P>
     And to those who say they support the Brady Bill because it can't hurt, let me tell you a story. Armed with a knife, Charles A. Grant, Jr., sexually assaulted a 33-year-old woman on a Virginia beach woman one Tuesday in 1991. The assault was videotaped by a tourist who (not having a permit to carry a concealed handgun for protection), could do nothing to help except record the crime.
<P>
    Wednesday, Charles Grant raped a 12-year-old girl. News broadcasts of the videotape of Grant's Tuesday assault frightened many people in the nearby Nags Head community. 
<P>
     A young woman named Sonya Miller had been wanting a handgun for a while, and on that Wednesday, her father bought her a .38 special revolver. He gave her the revolver that evening.
<P>
     At about 9 p.m., Miss Miller went to the post office to pick up her mail. As she stepped into the dimly lit parking lot near the post office, Charles Grant saw her, and she saw Charles Grant. They both screamed. Grant told the young woman he would not hurt her, but when she attempted to get into her car, Grant lunged at the door. He stuck a .25 caliber pistol in her face, began climbing into the car's back seat, and said I'm going to kill you. 
<P>
     No, she replied, I'm going to kill you. Sonya Miller picked up the revolver she hadacquired less than 15 minutes before. When she pulled the hammer back, he dropped his gun and fled. Miss Miller drove home; her father called the sheriff's office; and Charles Grant was apprehended.
<P>
     Regarding the handgun Miss Miller had just acquired, It's the only thing that saved her life, her father observed. To enact the Brady Bill is to sign the death warrant for the next Sonya Miller. How many innocent people should die so that President Clinton is able to brag that he beat the NRA?
<P>
Federal Death Penalty. How about the rest of the crime bill? Well, President Clinton is probably right that there is some role for a federal death penalty -- especially if adequate funding for defense counsel, and reasonable habeas corpus rules ensure that only guilty people are executed.
But, as Representative John Conyers points out, it is foolish for politicians to posture about how tough on crime they are by listing the number of offenses for which they have created a federal death penalty. Senator Biden's 1992 crime bill found over 50 offenses meriting a federal death penalty, including murder of a federal meat inspector. I would suggest that our streets will not become safer simply because a tough message is sent to those hardened thugs who prey on Department of Agriculture employees.
<P>
     And the moral educational purpose that the death penalty serves -- to highlight the sanctity of human life by emphasizing society's horror at the unjustified taking of an innocent life -- is undermined by the application of the death penalty to any offense other than homicide. Thus, the proposal of Presidential candidate Paul Tsongas, which was echoed in the 1992 Biden
crime bill, to impose the death penalty for possession of large quantities of drugs is morally reprehensible. Assisting another person in engaging in a vice, or in making a foolish medical choice, or in altering their own state of consciousness is not on the same moral plane as homicide. To persons who believe otherwise, consider the possibility that if the mere release of
allegedly pernicious drugs into the stream of commerce becomes a capital offense, how long will it be until corporate officers who, through the chain of command, are already deemed criminally responsible for the release of  actual poisons into rivers and the air, become the next targets for
an omnivorous federal death penalty. The claim that particular water pollution didn't actually kill anyone may be deemed no more an excuse than the claim that a particular crop of hemp never killed anyone.
<P>
     So in proposing a relatively sensible federal death penalty, and resisting the urge for excessive piling on of inappropriate capital offenses, the Clinton crime bill deserves a cheer -- especially if the administration has the gumption to resist a piling on process as the bill moves through Congress.
<P>
A  Standing Army. But no cheers are due for the proposal for federal funding for 50,000 new police officers. First of all, the economy is just beginning to suffer from the largest tax increase in human history in order, supposedly, to reduce the massive federal deficit. This is no time to begin adding even more federal programs.
<P>
     Second, there is no hard evidence that police density makes that much a difference in crime. In 1973, the Kansas City police conducted a year-long experiment. Unbeknownst to the public, all patrol cars and foot patrols were pulled out of one area in the city, and placed in an adjacent, similar area. The police only entered the first area in response to specific calls for
assistance, while the second area enjoyed a doubling of the police presence. And after a year, the crime rate in both areas was unchanged.
<P>
     More fundamentally, federal funding of local police will inevitably bring local police under federal control. Major federal funding of highway construction was commenced with the best of intentions during the Eisenhower presidency, with no strings attached other than highway quality standardization. But in a few decades, the states had grown addicted to federal highway dollars, and those dollars have led to Congressional micromanagement of state drinking ages and of state driver's license revocation policies. Federal funding of education is well on the way to
destroying local control of public and private education. To pretend that federal funding of policing will have any result other than to gradually bring local police forces under the command of a federal police czar is unrealistic.
<P>
     The alternative Republican crime bill is superior to the Clinton proposal in that it pays for new spending by cutting spending elsewhere. But again, spending cuts ought to go to deficit reduction, not new spending. And the Republican alternative runs the same risk of the Clinton bill, of tieing local law enforcement to a federal tether.
<P>
     And the federalization of local police, combined with Vice-President Gore's proposal to consolidate all federal law enforcement under a single command brings us to violation of the spirit, at least, of the Second Amendment.
<P>
     The Second Amendment isn't about duck hunting, nor about shooting lone criminals, although both activities were considered morally laudable.  The Second Amendment at its core is about fear of a criminal federal government in general, and fear of a federal standing army in particular. Uniformed, professional, heavily-armed employees of the central government in Washington -- these were the people that the authors of the Constitution wisely feared would be more loyal to centralized authority than to the communities of America. And it was fear of this mercenary presence which wisely led the authors of our Constitution to believe that law enforcement should be under local control, where the checks and balances of community control would be strongest, and -- unlike the Mongol divisions of the Chinese Red army who massacred the Chinese students at Tienanmen Square -- locally-controlled law enforcement would be less likely to turn its guns on its own community.
<P>
     Thus, the issue on some of the more experimental aspects of the Clinton crime package, such as the national police corps, the community grants to local governments, the use of national service to fund police officers, and the funding of boot camps for first-time offenders, is not whether they will work. The 50 states are fully capable of conducting their own experiments with innovative crime control policies. And such experimentation is likely to be more fruitful when the states are spending their own money. The question for federal funding of these programs is whether they will erode local control, and augment federal control. And why do we need $475
million federal dollars to pay for school security guards? Or to pay for drug education programs? Can't local school boards make their own decisions, with their own tax dollars? And by the way, since the people elected Bill Clinton President, rather than Josef Stalin, isn't it time to do away
with federal funding for  so-called drug education programs that encourage children to turn their parents into the police?
<P>
     Troops to cops sounds like a nice idea -- training retiring military veterans to take police jobs. But do we really want the police to become even more like the military -- to focus on capturing an area and destroying an enemy, to rely heavily on high-tech assaults, with, understandably in a military context, no regard for the rights of persons being attacked, and only scant regard for the safety of bystanders?
<P>
     Already we live in a world were federal agencies feel free to assault on specious charges a peaceful community which happens to have eccentric religious beliefs and a lot of firearms. Already we live in a world where National Guard soldiers point their machine guns at teenage girls, while the United States Army, without probable cause, searches farms for illegal hemp, a product which George Washington grew on his own farm. Will America really be freer and safer by taking more giant steps towards a federal standing army involved in domestic law enforcement?

     <P>
     Let me suggest some elements that ought to have been included in a genuine criminal justice reform bill, reforms that would leave America both safer and freer: 
<P>
Forfeiture reform. Step one, consider Representative Henry Hyde's H.R. 2417, the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act. The act protects the fundament right to private property and restores the presumption of innocence through the following measures:
<P>
      Placing the burden of proof on the government. The government would be required to prove guilt, rather than the property owner being required to prove innocence.
<P>
      Providing for the appointment of legal counsel for indigent persons whose property has been seized. The billions of dollars in revenue generated by forfeiture programs provide more than enough resources to pay for counsel.
<P>
      Protecting from forfeiture the property of persons who have taken reasonable steps to ensure that the property would not be used in crime.
<P>
      Eliminating the requirement that persons opposing a forfeiture put up a 10% bond of the property's value. Under current practices, the government takes the property, and then makes the owner put up a bond for the property's value, if she wants to appeal the case while the government retains her property.
<P>
      Extending the time allowed from forfeiture challenges to 60 days after seizure, instead of the current 10 days.
<P>
      Authorizing property owners to sue the government for negligence damage to the property while the property was in government custody; and
<P>
      Allowing the property to be returned to the property owner pending a final resolution of the case, as long as adequate arrangements are made for the security of the property.
<P>
     Indeed, the Hyde forfeiture ought to be followed up with additional forfeiture reforms. A proportionality requirement should be introduced, so that a 10 million dollar piece of property is not subject to forfeiture over a dollar's worth of hemp.  And most importantly, we need to reform the forfeiture laws so that property is only subject to forfeiture if there is an attendant criminal conviction. The requirement for a criminal conviction has been evaded by the legal fiction that a forfeiture proceeding is an action against the property, rather than the owner. Simply put, legal fictions and the administrative convenience of law enforcement agencies should not be allowed to trump our nation's traditional commitment to private property as the foundation of a free society.
<P>
State Authority. Step two, as a beginning towards returning control over criminal justice to the states, reduce the budgets of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Drug Enforcement Agency by 80%. Much of what these agencies do has nothing to do with any legitimate federal role in law enforcement. Arresting persons who sell small quantities of drugs or who sell firearms without a license is well within the competence of state and local law enforcement agencies. Federal agencies should focus exclusively on genuinely federal issues, such as the importation or interstate distribution of illegal commodities.
<P>
     Belief in the need to trim the federal role is not confined to libertarians and conservatives who thought that President Reagan's affirmation of the 10th Amendment was the best part of his first inaugural address. The National Sheriffs' Association and the American Correctional
Association ask us to Halt the growing trend towards federalization of state crimes. Federal criminal jurisdiction should not be expanded into areas of traditional state authority unless state, local and federal officials agree that there is a clear and compelling need for an increased federal presence.
<P>
     It is time that we recognized that a one-size-fits all federal approach is not working on most federal programs, including crime control. Mississippi doesn't need to have the same kinds of drug or alcohol laws as does Wisconsin, and Colorado ought to be able to watch the success or failure of the programs in Wisconsin and Mississippi, and then choose its own unique approach. Washington should get out of the business of trying to impose laws drafted in Washington as state statutes, and Washington should get out of the business of enforcing laws which are primarily a state and local concern. Why should Washington, rather than a state legislature, decide what requirements a licensed gun dealer should have? Why should Washington decide what kind of licensing system should be imposed on machine gun owners? Can't New Jersey and Arizona answer these questions differently, and why should Washington take away their 10th amendment right to do so?
<P>
     The 10th Amendment critique of federal criminal justice is not dependent on suspicion of the substance of underlying criminal laws. Carjacking is obviously a heinous crime, and carjackers deserve severe punishment, including the death penalty when the carjacking results in
a felony murder. But what business does Congress have passing a federal carjacking statute? Carjackings are not perpetrated by interstate conspiracies of automobile smugglers. Nor are state and local prosecutors reluctant to prosecute and vigorously punish these thugs. Likewise, turning
rape into a federal offense by redefining it as a civil rights violation improperly insults state and local law enforcement by presuming that existing rape laws are not vigorously enforced.
<P>
     Conservatives who want to use federal funds to push states towards remaking their state criminal justice system in a conservative image, with more mandatory minimums, pre-trial detention, and truth-in-sentencing, might perhaps consider what will happen when the tools of federal coercion begin to be used to require the states, increasingly dependent on federal criminal
justice dollars, to enforce the leftist criminal agenda: Mandatory minimums for paperwork violations of environmental laws. Harsh forfeitures imposed on persons who dare to possess an unregistered shotgun. Re-education program for the politically incorrect whose dissent from the radical feminist and critical race theory agenda is labeled hate speech.
<P>
     In this regard, applause is due to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which a few days ago declared unconstitutional the federal Gun-free School Zones Act. By that 1990 law, it is a federal felony for you to park your car across the street from your house, take your unloaded hunting rifle out of your car trunk, and carry the rifle into your home, if you happen to be within a thousand feet of a school. Certainly state and local government ought to be able to restrict the carrying of weapons onto school property. But again, the restrictions appropriate in New York City are not appropriate for Bozeman, Montana. The federal Court of Appeals recognized as much, by declaring that federal control of this issue was an unreasonable intrusion into a traditional area of state and local control.
<P>
Warrant reform. If we can get the federal government out of regulating areas of state and local concern, such as who can possess firearms components, then we will begin saving lives by reducing the scope of operations of agencies such as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The fiasco and mass-murder in Waco highlight the need to prevent the fraudulent procurement of warrants for hypertechnical violations of BATF interpretations of federal gun laws. In this regard, the warrant requirement for gun law violations, and perhaps for other federal crimes as well, should be protected through the following reforms:
<P>
      Require that a warrant application be reviewed by a United States Attorney before being presented to a judge or magistrate. This will allow the Department of Justice to perform its proper function to review the legality of federal agency actions.
<P>
      Allow use of hearsay evidence only if the actual witness is unavailable.
<P>
      Require that probable cause be established for each element of the alleged offense.
<P>
      Establish a reasonable time limit, such as 30 days, between the date of an alleged offense and the date of a search warrant. This will prevent Waco-type situations, where a February 1993 raid was launched for offenses which had allegedly occurred in early 1992.
<P>
      Require that an application for a warrant fully inform the magistrate or judge of contradictory or possibly exculpatory evidence.

   <P>   Establish the presumption that once a warrant is served, the warrant and accompanying application should almost never be sealed from public disclosure, except when necessary to protect the safety of persons identified in the warrant application.
<P>
      Require specific judicial authorization for use of extraordinary use of force in serving a warrant, including no-knock entry. 
<P>
These changes would not impair the ability of responsible law enforcement agencies to obtain warrants, but they would prevent at least some irresponsible and abusive federal actions.
<P>
Mandatory Minimums. Finally, it is time for Congress to consider seriously Rep. Don Edwards (D-Calif.) bill to repeal all federal mandatory minimums, especially regarding non-violent crimes. Nearly 70% of federal prison space is used to house drug offenders, many of them first offenders serving 5, 10 or 20 year mandatory minimums. A free-market economist can tell you why this
policy hasn't created a dent in the supply of illegal drugs. Federal prison space should prioritize the long-term incarceration of violent offenders. Violent convicts should be allocated sufficient prison space to ensure that they stay off the streets until they are too old and lacking in high-
level testosterone to commit further violent crime. Only once the violent criminals are taken off the streets for good should whatever prison space is left over be used for non-violent prisoners.
<P>
     It is notable and commendable that the prison-building programs in the Republican alternative crime bill are focussed on increasing prison space for repeat violent offenders.
<P>
     In conclusion, I would urge that the conservatives of the 1990s take heed from some of the failures of the 1960s. The liberals of the 1960s were motivated by legitimate concerns for economic and social justice, as the conservatives and President Clinton are today motivated by genuine concerns over criminal justice. But these laudable concerns should not obscure the
fundamental principle that our federal government is one of limited, enumerated powers, and has no general police power to legislate at large. Many criminal justice programs that can appropriately be proposed by the Governor of Arkansas are not appropriately proposed by the President of the United States. The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as the practical experience of decades of failed federal efforts to control matters of state and local concern, perhaps suggest that it is time to begin reducing, rather than expanding, the role of the federal government in many areas, including criminal justice.<P>

<h3> CRIME, POVERTY, AND THE FAMILY </h3>
<b>By The Honorable William P. Barr </b>
<P> <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>July 29, 1992.
<P>

            

      I don't have to tell you that things are at a critical juncture
in our country when it comes to violent crime. We find violence now
running at intolerably high levels. The heyday of violent crime was
actually in the 1960s and 1970s, and I will describe it in more detail
later. It peaked in 1980. It started going downward for a few years
and now it is picking back up again. It has since 1986 drifted back up
again, although the victimization rates today are still significantly
lower than they were at its peak in 1980 and 1981. 
<P>
      I think the trend we are seeing in violent crime is driven
basically by three factors. First, the crack epidemic that started in
about 1986 has led to a high degree of violence. Second, we are seeing
the results of some of the family policies of the 1960s and 1970s --
the breakdown of the family -- and we are starting to pay the price
for that with a surge in juvenile crime and the emergence of gangs.
And third, we are seeing the saturation of the criminal justice
systems in the states and the states relapsing to revolving door
justice as prisoners are serving less and less of their sentences and
are being prematurely released. I think those are the main factors in
this upward trend of violence. 
<P>
      Now, in public discourse about how to deal with this violence,
we generally see two competing views. One is the traditional law
enforcement approach, which says crime is caused by criminals and the
way we deal with crime is to use aggressive enforcement policies and
to deter or incapacitate criminals through incarceration. On the other
hand, I think we see a lot said about what I call the social
rehabilitation response to violent crime. That approach tends to see
crime as caused by societal ills and seeks to deal with crime by
remedying these ills through social programs. Proponents of this
approach say that you can't really deal with violent crime by
suppression, you have to attack it at its root causes. 
<P>
      Combined Approach. I think we need both approaches, properly
understood, acting together. We do have to take aggressive steps today
to deal with the criminals of today. But, we also have to take steps
and we do need programs to prevent, as best we can, the youth of today
from becoming the chronic offenders of tomorrow.
<P>
      I think too many advocates of the root causes approach, however,
give short shrift to the need for tough law enforcement. They just
can't bring themselves to deal with criminals decisively and they tend
to dismiss reliance on police and prosecutors and prisons as
unenlightened. Many times I hear it said that we should be spending
money on schools and housing and so forth rather than on police and
prosecutors and prisons. 
<P>
      Well, today I want to make three points. First, I want to
explain why I think a strong law enforcement approach has to be
paramount. Second, I want to discuss what I think we in law
enforcement can do to have an impact. And third, I want to spend a
little time talking about social programs and the root causes approach
to dealing with violent crime and what I think we have to do there.
<P>
      Basic Reality. So, let us turn first to the issue of why law
enforcement must be paramount today. I think those that would give
short shrift to suppression of crime through strong law enforcement
measures, but would instead rely upon dealing with root causes, are
missing a basic point -- the basic reality that we see today -- and
that is, that in this pervasive atmosphere of fear and violence that
we see in the inner cities particularly, even the best designed social
programs cannot take root. The problem is that our efforts to deal
with underlying social maladies are being strangled by crime itself.
And I think it is increasingly clear that suppression of crime is a
prerequisite for any of our social programs to be successful. 
<P>
      What good is it to build a housing project to see it taken over
by drug traffickers and used as a stash house? Or what good is it to
invest as much as we do in education and build model schools, only to
see those schools become battlegrounds for gangs? The Green Housing
Project in Chicago is a project where the federal government has spent
a lot of money and has many innovative programs underway. But the
principal concern of the mothers in that housing project is the safety
of their children. They put their children to sleep in the bathtubs
because of the bullets flying around, starting Thursday night and
running through the weekend. So we have gotten to the age of armored
cribs in the inner city. 
<P>
      I was down at the Prince Garden Apartments Project in Fort
Worth. It had just been swept by the police, and the tenants of those
apartments came out applauding the police. They held a barbecue for
the police, pleading with them not to leave their housing project. One
old lady came out and told me that she had been sleeping on the floor
under her bed for months because of the bullets flying around the
courtyard in the housing project. 
<P>
      Crime Causing Poverty. It was once a shibboleth that poverty
causes crime, but today I think it is clear that crime is causing
poverty. Businesses are driven from crime-ridden neighborhoods, taking
jobs and opportunities with them. Potential investors and would-be
employers are scared away. Existing owners are deterred from making
improvements on their property, and as property values go down, owners
disinvest in their property. I know a small contractor who tried to
rehabilitate inner-city housing for low-income tenants. He had to give
up because drug addicts would break in, rip out his improvements, and
sell them for drug money. They would even come in regularly and take
out all of the piping in the building and sell it for scrap. This
contractor obviously couldn't continue like that, and like many others
has just stopped his efforts to rehabilitate housing. 
<P>
      I think that what we saw in Los Angeles shows the difficulty we
are going to have in rebuilding those communities. It shows the impact
of crime on a community in fast motion, fast forward. But that same
process is occurring around the country at a more deliberate speed.
<P>
      So in short, I don't think you can have progress amid chaos. And
the fact is that no urban program can arrest the decline in our inner
cities, and no anti-poverty programs are going to take hold unless
they are combined with and founded upon strong law enforcement
measures that suppress violent crime.
<P>
      That brings me to my second point, which I am going to dwell on
at length: What do we do on the law enforcement side to suppress
violent crime? How do we actually make reductions in violent crime? In
my view, the evidence is absolutely clear that the vast bulk of
violent crime is committed by a very small group of chronic offenders.
Study after study shows that this tiny fraction of incorrigible,
habitual offenders is responsible for hundreds and hundreds of crimes
each while they are out on the street. A well known study in 1980,
which followed 240 criminals, found that in an eleven-year period they
committed over 500,000 crimes -- an average of 190 crimes a year. And
that corresponds to numerous other studies that show that kind of
criminality. Another study of various state prisoners found that 25
percent of them committed 135 crimes a year; 10 percent of them
committed 600 crimes a year. Every study shows a tiny cohort is
responsible disproportionately for the vast amount of predatory
violence.
<P>
      We know the profile of these criminals. They start committing
crimes as juveniles. They go right on committing crimes. They commit
crimes as adults; they commit crimes when they are on parole,
probation, or bail. With this type of habitual offender, the only time
they are not committing crimes, at least prior to their fortieth
birthday, is when they are in prison. 
<P>
      Today's Conflagration. And I think that in combatting violent
crime, we in the criminal justice system must make it our primary goal
to identify, to target, and to incarcerate this hard core element of
chronic offenders. They should be incapacitated in custody for the
time dictated by the public's safety, and not by other artificial
restraints like prison space. I think this is the only approach in law
enforcement that has any prospect for reducing levels of violent
crime. No matter how well we tinker with and perfect our social
rehabilitation programs, they are not going to take hold for decades
and decades. We have crime on the streets right now. We have to put
out the fire today. Yes, we can redesign houses so they are more
fireproof in the future, but right now we have a conflagration and we
have to deal with it. 
<P>
      I think the history of the last thirty years shows that this
policy of incarceration works. The 1960s and 1970s, as you know, were
the era of permissiveness in law enforcement. Fewer people were locked
up. The people we put away did not serve long sentences. The
incarceration rates dropped. At the end of the 1960s we had fewer
people in prison than we did when the decade started. In the 1980s, we
started turning things around. We built prisons at the federal level
and the state level. We toughened up our criminal justice system. We
started putting tougher federal judges on the bench. And during the
1980s we turned around the incarceration rates. We started out with
300,000 prisoners in state prisons at the beginning of the decade and
we ended it with 800,000. The spiraling violent crime rate of the
1960s and 1970s came to an abrupt halt and plateaued out. But now it
is going up again.
<P>
      I think if we are going to reduce violent crime we have to
finish the job we began in the 1980s and get those violent offenders
off the street. Unfortunately, I think a lot of states are relapsing
back to the 1960s and 1970s-style revolving door system. Today,
prisoners on the average are serving only 37 percent of their
sentences. In some states, like Texas, they say it is 22 days for
every one year of sentence. In Florida, it is 18 percent of sentence
served. That is because of prison capacity. Prisoners are being
recycled back out onto the streets, after a very short period of time
in prison, simply to make room for the next wave. The average sentence
given for rape in this country, for example, is eight years; the
average sentence served is three years. Three years is the average
price of a rape. In many larger states, it is much lower than that. At
least 30 percent of the murders in this country are committed by
people who are on probation, parole, or bail at the time of murder.
So, 6,500 of our fellow citizens are slaughtered each year by people
who have been caught and then prematurely released back onto the
streets.
<P>
      I think stopping the revolving door is going to require three
things. It is going to require more resources at both the federal and
state level. It is going to require legal reform at both the federal
and state level. And it is going to require an unprecedented degree of
cooperation -- the federal government, the state government, local
enforcement working together to target the hardest core offenders so
we get the most bang for the bucks. 
<P>
      The President has put substantial resources both into the
federal effort and into state law enforcement, substantially
increasing assistance to the states -- notwithstanding some erroneous
information handed out last week by political opponents -- and
substantially increasing the Justice Department budget over 60 percent
in three years. And he has done this against the Congress that has
been cutting back on his law enforcement requests. I think we are
going to have to see the states also make that kind of commitment. My
own view is that we are not spending enough on state and local law
enforcement. 
<P>
      We have to get back to basics during times of tight budgets and
spend money on things that count. We have to recall that protecting
the public security is the first duty of government. That is why we
submit ourselves to government in the first place, because of the
security. The government has an obligation to perform that function,
and right now they are not putting in the kind of investment that is
needed.
<P>
      Astronomical Costs. In fact, we are being penny wise and pound
foolish, because the cost of not investing in law enforcement is much
higher than the cost of investing. The cost of crime -- just the
economic cost -- is $92 billion a year. That doesn't count lives lost.
It is lost to the criminal justice system in revolving doors -- we
just keep on spending our resources, spinning our wheels, essentially.
There is the cost of private security. We spend astronomical amounts
of money in private security in this country. We don't put the bars up
around the prisoners, people who deserve to be behind bars, and
private citizens pay to put bars up between themselves and prisoners,
and they become the prisoners. And that is exactly what is happening.
And there are a lot of other economic costs -- lost sales, lost
revenues, and so forth.
<P>
      When you total it all up, it is clear that the cost of spending
on an effective criminal justice system is far lower. There is one ATF
study that crystallizes this. It costs an average of $25,000 a year to
keep someone in a prison cell. The ATF study of chronic firearms
offenders in the federal system came up with the figure of over
$300,000 for each year those people were out on the street and the
crimes they committed. So, I think that law enforcement is an
investment well worth making in these tight budget times.
<P>
      On the reform level, you are all aware that we accomplished a
lot in the 1980s. We abolished parole at the federal level and gave
strong minimum sentences and so forth. We had an unfinished agenda --
the death penalty, habeas corpus reform, expansion of the good faith
exception to the exclusionary rule -- and those were in the federal
crime bill that the President is pushing. But 95 percent of violent
crime is at the state level. That, I think is where the real battle
is. Unless we reform the state systems in the 1990s, as we did with
the federal system in the 1980s, we are not going to make much
progress in dealing with violent crime.
<P>
      And so, reform is critical. Yesterday we issued a report with 24
specific recommendations on how state criminal justice systems can be
improved. That report has wide backing in the law enforcement
community and among victims' groups. I am optimistic that is going to
be helpful to groups that are seeking improvement in the criminal
justice systems in their states.
<P>
      Targeting Chronic Offenders. I mentioned corporation and
targeting our resources on the most hard-core offenders. We have an
aggressive program in several areas where we are trying to do that.
For example, the program that I just released our first report on
today -- our first annual report -- is a trickle off program where we
work with a combination of state and local enforcement to use tough
firearms laws to take out chronic offenders. By giving them tough
federal penalties without probation or parole we keep them off the
streets. Over the past year, for example, we have prosecuted over
6,400 individuals; we are achieving an over 90 percent conviction
rate. The average sentence without parole is seven years for these
firearms offenders -- I am talking about felons who use firearms.
Three-time losers, people with three prior offenses, are averaging
eighteen years without parole in the federal system. These are the
worst of the worst -- chronic offenders with extensive criminal
history records who are caught in possession of a firearm.
<P>
      That is just one example of targeting our resources to the
chronic offender. We have similar programs underway against gangs
across the country, and I think in the months ahead you will start to
see more gangs being taken down in Philadelphia. In our pilot project
and violent traffickers program, which we did in conjunction with the
Philadelphia police department, a three-year program, we destroyed 38
gangs, 600 gang members. The leaders of those gangs are serving time
in federal penitentiaries right now without parole or probation. We
also have similar operations going on with respect to chronic offender
fugitives and with respect to criminal aliens. 
<P>
      Root Causes. What this all means is, if we put in sufficient
resources and target our efforts at incapacitating prime offenders, if
we put in more resources and we accomplish needed reform, and if we
work together in joint programs that target our limited resources at
the hardest core element, then I think we can have an impact on
violent crime. I think we can provide a foundation upon which our
efforts at social rehabilitation can be successful. 
<P>
      And that brings me to my third and final point. As I said at the
outset, I think strong law enforcement ultimately should be combined
with economic and social and moral rehabilitation of our communities,
particularly in our inner-city neighborhoods. How do you go about the
task of revitalizing them? What are the root causes of crime and what
do you have to do to address them? What kind of social programs should
we be pursuing? Now there are some who say that what we need is
another massive round of spending on social welfare programs. And I
think that is a mistaken view. We have poured trillions of dollars
into social welfare programs over the last 25 years. The root-cause
strategy is not something new. The root-cause strategy is precisely
what we have been pursuing for 25 years.
<P>
      Today, the government is spending, just on means-tested anti-
poverty programs, record amounts -- $280 billion a year. This is up
from $9.6 billion in 1965 at the start of the Great Society. It is up
from $106 billion in 1980 and it has gone up significantly in real
terms during President Bush's Administration. A record 4.77 percent of
GDP now goes into means-tested programs. And that comes down to $3,111
for every taxpayer -- $3,111 goes into anti-poverty spending. That
doesn't take into account non-means tested root-cause programs. And
what have we gotten for this investment? I think that any fair-minded
observer would have to say that the overall results of this 25-year
war on poverty have been disappointing. Certainly the track record of
these programs in fighting poverty has been less than impressive.
<P>
      Now frankly, I think the argument that poverty causes crime is
too much overstated. I think poverty is probably a contributing factor
toward crime. But standing alone, the correlation between poverty as a
causal factor in crime is very weak. In 1950, for example, the poverty
rate was about 32 percent; today, it is 13.5 percent. And yet in 1950
crime rates were much lower than they are today. And in the Great
Depression, when about half of this nation's population lived below
the poverty line, as today defined, crime was more lower than it is
today. When you look at our cities on a grid basis, neighborhood by
neighborhood, the fact is that some of our poorest neighborhoods have
relatively low crime rates.
<P>
      But even accepting poverty as a contributing factor to crime,
the fact is that, despite our massive spending programs, hard-core
poverty seems as stubborn as ever. The fact of the matter is, more
progress was made on reducing poverty levels in the seven years
preceding the Great Society than has been made since the Great
Society. And most of the progress in reducing poverty levels was made
in the years immediately following 1965 and during the early years of
the Reagan revolution. Otherwise, results have been very
disappointing. There seems to be a persistent class of about 10-15
million Americans for whom poverty and dependency is long term and
even inter-generational. Our anti-poverty programs have made virtually
no headway against this hard-core group.
<P>
      But more significantly, the policies of the past 25 years have
contributed directly to the breakdown of the family, particularly in
the inner cities. Now, before the Los Angeles riots I said on the
David Brinkley show that we were witnessing in inner-city crime the
grim harvest of the Great Society. Senator Moynihan said that this was
the most depraved statement he had ever heard from anybody. I stand by
what I said. 
<P>
      The welfare policies we have been pursuing since 1965 contain
perverse incentives that have contributed to the breakdown of the
family by rewarding and promoting non-marriage and illegitimacy. The
numbers are truly staggering. The illegitimacy rate started to
escalate rapidly after 1965. In 1965, 7.7 percent of American children
were born to unwed mothers. Today the rate is 27 percent. For black
children it has climbed to 65 percent, and in many inner-city areas it
is over 80 percent. And this has been compounded by the skyrocketing
divorce rates in our society. The number of divorces per year has
tripled since 1960.
<P>
      Disintegration of the Family. This family breakdown is a social
and a moral catastrophe and is at the root of so many of the problems
that beset out nation. In my view, the root cause of both crime and
poverty is precisely this unraveling of the family. I think the
evidence is clear that children from single-parent homes use drugs
more heavily and commit more crimes throughout their lives than
children from two-parent homes. Studies show that most gang members
come from single-parent homes. Some 70 percent of juvenile delinquents
in state reform institutions lived in single-parent homes or with
someone other than their natural parents. One study found that 75
percent of adolescent murderers came from single-parent homes. Recent
research by June O'Neill, formerly of the Urban Institute, finds that
a black child in a single-parent home is more than twice as likely to
engage in criminal activities as a black child from a two-parent home.
Moreover, when that child is in a neighborhood where there are many
other single-parent families, the child becomes three times more
likely to engage in criminal activity. A 1988 study published in the
Journal of Research on Crime and Delinquencies found that the rates of
violent crime in a community correlated directly with the proportion
of single-parent households in the community, but not the poverty or
racial composition apart from family structure. In other words, they
found that neither poverty nor race were significantly correlated to
crime when family structure is taken into account.
<P>
      Moreover, the disintegration of the family is the basic cause of
long-term poverty and dependency in America today. Almost 70 percent
of single-parent families with children and 80 percent of never-
married mothers receive some form of government assistance. The
poverty rate for female-headed households with children is at 44.5
percent, compared to 7.8 percent for married couples with children.
Single-parent families account for 65 percent of poor families with
children, and over half of all poor families. Studies show that it is
primarily this group among the poor who remain mired in poverty and
dependency over the long term.
<P>
      So, that is the track record of the policies that we have been
pursuing for 25 years -- little headway against hard-core poverty and
the contribution to the breakdown of the family, which in turn, spawns
crime and further poverty. The idea that if we just increase our
record spending levels by a few more tens of billions of dollars we
will somehow achieve a breakthrough is, in my view, incredible.
<P>
      Reform Agenda. The solution is not in the scale of the programs
we have been pursuing, it is in their structure. We have to be a lot
smarter about the kinds of growth that we pursue. And in this regard,
from the very beginning of the Administration, this President has been
pursuing a reform agenda -- a set of new ideas, not business as usual,
not pouring money into these discredited programs. His efforts seem to
avoid the mistakes of the past. So rather than blindly following those
programs that foster dependency and contain incentives that reward
non-work and non-marriage and illegitimacy, the President has proposed
programs that promote bottom-up growth and give real opportunity. And
that is why he is proposing enterprise zones to bring jobs and
investment into the inner cities and why he is proposing to give
public housing residents the opportunity to purchase their homes. That
is why he has been urging welfare reform to turn around the current
system that rewards non-marriage and illegitimacy and to promote
stable family life. Strong families in the long run will be more
effective than big bureaucracies in revitalizing our inner-city
communities. And he has been seeking to empower grass roots
institutions, not bureaucracies. I think the best hope for genuine
community renewal lies in fostering the rebirth of those traditional
institutions which emerge from the communities themselves and are the
best institutions for the moral formation of children -- the family
and the church and community groups. 
<P>
      Today many of the social experts who brought us the 1960s and
1970s, and are largely responsible for the fix we are in, are
promoting a further set of half-baked solutions to our problems that,
I think, send the wrong moral message and are equally
counterproductive -- like handing out needles to addicts and condoms
to the kids in high school, and even below high school level. 
<P>
      Sending the Right Message. Our social programs, I think, have to
send the right message if we want to turn around behavior. Now law
enforcement sends a clear message about right and wrong, about
personal responsibility, and about what a just society expects of its
citizens. Our social programs must reinforce that message.
<P>
      So, my message today really is threefold. First, social programs
can't be pursued at the expense of, or in lieu of, tough law
enforcement policies. On the contrary, law enforcement is the
foundation upon which all else must be built and is an absolute
prerequisite for social programs to be successful.
<P>
      Second, the only way to reduce violent crime is to target and
incapacitate chronic violent offenders through the tough policy of
incarceration. While this Administration has acted vigorously at the
federal level to help states deal with violent crime, the long-term
solution is for the states to toughen up their own criminal justice
systems and make adequate investments in them.
<P>
      And third, pouring money into a new round of social welfare
programs is not the answer. Instead, we have to be smarter about the
way we pursue social welfare programs. We need programs that foster
opportunity and not dependency, strengthen not undermine the family,
and that sends the right not the wrong message. 
<P>
      These are difficult problems that grew up over decades. And now
the people who helped contribute to the problems are holding stop
watches on the solutions. The problems will not be solved overnight;
it is going to be a long-run proposition. But I think that if we
follow this agenda -- the President's agenda -- then we can make a
real impact and make this a safer and more just society.<P>

<h3>
FIGHTING CRIME: ASSESSING  THE BUSH  AND  BIDEN APPROACHES </h3>

By Andrew J.  Cowin<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

Issues Bulletin No. 164<br>
June 10, 1991<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<B> INTRODUCTION </B>
<P>

 Congress is considering two major anti-crime packages.  One
package, sponsored by the Bush Administration, was introduced in
the Senate by Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican, as
S.635 and in the House as H.R.  1400 by GOP Leader Robert Michel
of Illinois.  The second package consists of two bills, S.15 and S.618,
introduced in the Senate by Joseph Biden, the Delaware Democrat
who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
    <P>  Of the two, the Bush package is better -- mainly because it is
realistic about what the federal government can do about street crime
all across America.  The Biden package, by contrast, while containing
some promising proposals, increases federal intrusion into local law
enforcement.  All this will do is spend huge sums of money and
expand the federal bureaucracy, while actually making it more
difficult for local police and prosecutors to capture and convict
criminals.
<P>
       Until recent decades, crimes such as murder, assault and
robbery, and most of what are known as street crimes, were dealt
with by the states and localities in which they occurred, under state
and local laws.  Consistently and wisely the United States has rejected
the need for a national police force to deal with such matters. 
Instead, the federal government has focused mainly on interstate
crimes, on keeping national crime statistics and on helping local law
enforcement officials keep up with the latest crime prevention
techniques.  Not until the late 1960s did the federal government
become deeply involved in local crime issues.  Since then, billions of
federal dollars have been spent on the war on crime -- with no
noticeable success.  In fact, violent street crime in America has grown
worse, rising by 10 percent last year alone. (Washington Post, April
29, 1991, A6.)
<P>
          The Bush anti-crime package recognizes that crime is
best fought locally.  The package thus mainly offers needed
amendments to federal criminal law.  It improves, for example, the
habeas corpus procedure by curtailing the number of times that a
convicted criminal can appeal to federal courts after full and fair
state criminal proceedings have been completed.  The Bush package
also reforms the exclusionary rule, which currently excludes relevant
evidence in criminal trials.  As important, the package does not
significantly increase federal intrusion into local law enforcement
efforts or simply throw more money at the crime problem.
<P>
          The Bush package thus makes a useful contribution to
America's fight against crime.  It is also an appropriate contribution
because it is limited, implicitly recognizing that the kind of crime that
mainly affects Americans is the kind of crime that mainly has to be
fought locally. 
<P>
           Ironically, George Bush does not seem to realize just
how appropriate his crime package is.  His State of the Union speech
this January, for example, and subsequent statements by him and his
Justice Department, talk about the package as if it were a
comprehensive, major federal anti-crime effort.  It is not.  And it is
not what America needs.  The White House would serve the nation
well by bringing presidential rhetoric into line with the President's
crime proposal.  So doing, it would remind Americans that states and
localities in the past, when unhampered by federal red tape, by and
large kept America's streets safe.
<P>
          In contrast to the Bush package, the Biden anti-crime
bills would accomplish very little, and actually would create yet new
obstacles to local attempts to deal with crime.  While the Bush crime
package would cost no new money, Biden wants to spend $4 billion
extra annually.  His bills would erect new mountains of red tape by
requiring the Executive Branch to submit ten new annual reports to
Congress.  The Biden package would intrude the federal government
further into local crime prevention efforts and would make local
criminal justice systems less responsive to the needs and concerns of
their citizens.  Biden, for instance, would inject the FBI into such
family disputes as wife-beating.  And it would establish what in
essence would be a racial quota system for the death penalty.
<P>
          The Biden package thus would take America further in
the direction towards having a national police force and this then
further would blur the roles of the federal and state governments in
crime prevention.
<P>
          Americans face two distinct views on the crime
problem.  One, offered by Bush, focuses on the concept that laws
must be reformed to ensure that the guilty go to jail.  The other,
offered by Biden, holds that America must spend much more federal
money fighting crime and increase the police power of the national
government.  The Bush vision is clearly preferable.
<P>
<B> STATE VERSUS FEDERAL ROLES IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE </B>
<P>
     Until the late 1960s, America's states and localities had
virtually exclusive responsibility for fighting violent street crime.  The
reasons for this are clear.  Criminals are arrested by local police. 
They are indicted under state and local laws.  They are tried in state
or county courts.  And they are sentenced to serve time in state or
county prisons. 
<P>
           The federal government traditionally has concerned
itself only with interstate crimes or crimes involving international
activities and to provide certain assistance for local law enforcement
officials.  These activities have included:
Fighting foreign drug cartels and organized crime groups like the
Mafia. 
<P>
 Compiling and disseminating research, statistics and other
information such as the number of crimes committed in each
jurisdiction in America; 
<P>
Providing information and limited training to local law enforcement
officials in advanced crime fighting techniques.
<P>
Collecting and maintaining a nationwide file of criminal records and
fingerprints. 
<P>
 Researching and developing scientific and technological advances
such as improved uses of "genetic fingerprinting" to identify suspects. 
  <P>    Not until Lyndon Johnson's 1968 Omnibus Crime and Safe
Streets Act did the federal government significantly intervene in local
crime.  This Act had broad support in Washington and among big-city
mayors and police chiefs.  After the Act was passed, the mayors,
predictably alert for revenue sources other than from their own
taxpayers, continued to pressure Congress for more anti-crime aid. 
Through subsequent amendments to the Act, Congress vastly
increased the amount of federal money devoted to local crime
problems.
<P>
          In addition to money, Congress also has approved using
federal manpower to fight local crime.  Example:  the 1988 Omnibus
Anti-Drug Act made possession of any amount of an illegal drug a
federal crime.  The result:  Thousands of street level drug-dealers
have been arrested by federal agents. 
<P>
           Despite this increased federal assistance, violent crime
rates jumped throughout the 1970s.  They did so also in the 1980s,
although at a slower rate than before.  Thus, federal intervention in
local crime has had little discernible impact aside from confusing the
issue over ultimate responsibility for attacking the problem.
<P>

<B> THE BUSH ANTI-CRIME PACKAGE </B>
<P>
     The Bush Administration has drafted and supports legislation
that closes loopholes in the federal system.  It does not attempt the
kind of grand crime-fighting strategy that likely would make matters
worse.  Many of the changes will affect only federal criminal
procedures and thus will have little impact on street crime. 
<P>
           Measures in the Bush package include:

<P>Reform of Habeas Corpus.  
<P>
          The Bush bill would reform the habeas corpus system. 
Habeas corpus generally refers to the right of individuals, guaranteed
by Article I, Section 9 of the U.S.  Constitution, not to be detained
without being charged with a crime.  The Bush bill does not deal with
this constitutional aspect of the right, but instead with what experts
call the statutory right of habeas corpus, enacted in 1867 and
expanded since by federal judges. 
<P>
           The statutory habeas corpus allows state prisoners to
petition federal courts for a review of their cases after they have
exhausted state remedies.  Lawyers for death row inmates in
particular have made substantial use of this as a device to postpone
executions.  Other inmates have inundated federal courts with pleas
to overturn sentences; typically these inmates argue that, at their
trials, they lacked effective counsel or that their trial procedurally was
flawed. 
<P>
           With few exceptions, these petitions raise frivolous
issues and are dismissed in federal court -- but only after they
consume enormous amounts of court time.  Last year alone, some
11,000 habeas corpus petitions were made by state prisoners to
federal courts.  Declares former Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell,
"I know of no other system of justice structured in a way that assures
no end to the litigation of a criminal conviction.  [This] system is
viewed with disbelief by lawyers and judges in other countries."
(Report to the Attorney General, Federal Habeas Corpus Review of
State Judgments, p.  viii, (1987).)
<P>
     The Bush package would help reduce this tidal wave of
petitions by setting, in most cases, a time limit for federal habeas
corpus application of one year after the state prisoner exhausted his
or her state remedies.  The bill, in addition, would require federal
judges whenever possible to uphold state court decisions.  This
provision also would apply to petitions involving most death penalty
cases. 

     
<P>
     

<P>Reform of the exclusionary rule.
<P>
          The "exclusionary rule" is so named by legal scholars
because it allows judges to "exclude" from the court's proceedings
relevant evidence found through what have been claimed to be illegal
searches.  Excluding such evidence often allows guilty defendants to
go free.
<P>
          The basis for the exclusionary rule is the Fourth
Amendment which states that 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> The right of people to be secure in their persons,
     houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable
     searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no
     warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported
     by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the
     place to be searched, and the persons or things to be
     seized.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
          The Fourth Amendment says nothing explicitly about
excluding evidence.  But, the Supreme Court stated in its 1914 Weeks
v.  United States ruling that courts would be sanctioning violations of
the Fourth Amendment if the material gathered through illegal
searches could be admitted into evidence. (Weeks v.  United States,
232 U.S.  383 (1914).)  This ruling was extended to criminal
proceedings at the state and local level by Mapp v.  Ohio in 1961. 
Over the years, this and other court decisions have allowed many
criminals to go free merely if the police commit even a minor blunder
in collecting crucial evidence.
     <P>     The Supreme Court in 1984 rectified part of this
problem in United States v.  Leon, by creating a "good faith"
exception for searches of private buildings pursuant to a warrant.
(United States v.  Leon, 468 U.S.  897 (1984).)  This means that if a
police offficer has good reasons to believe a search warrant is valid,
evidence gathered pursuant to that warrant must be admitted in
court, even if a judge later decides that the warrant was mistakenly
issued.  The Bush  bill would extend this good faith exception to all
circumstances, such as a car search made without a warrant.  The
number of cases affected, however, will be small; some estimates are
as low as 1.5 percent.  Still it will rid the court system of a loophole
that frustrates the police and creates confusion within the criminal
justice system.  More important, prosecutors will be able to coax
defendants into more stringent plea bargains because defendants will
have less hope of excluding important evidence.
<P>
          Most street criminals, however, are prosecuted in state
courts.  That will diminish the impact of Bush's exclusionary rule
reform because it is the judges on state courts, at least as much as
federal judges, who have been reluctant to recognize a good faith
exception.  They base their reluctance not on the U.S.  Constitution
but on the various state constitutions. 

<P>Expansion of the federal death penalty.  
<P>
          The federal death penalty now can be imposed for
espionage, treason, and murder involving certain federal crimes.  The
Supreme Court has ruled however that for the death penalty to be
enforced, aggravating and mitigating factors in a crime, spelled out in
statutory laws, must be taken into account.  Aggravating factors would
include committing the offense in an especially heinous, depraved and
cruel manner.  Mitigating factors can involve good conduct in jail or
seriously diminished mental capacity. ( See generally, Skipper v. 
South Carolina, 476 U.S.  1 (1986); Lockett v.  Ohio, 438 U.S.  586
(1978);  Barclay v.  Florida, 463 U.S.  939 (1983); Zant v.  Stephens,
462 U.S.  862 (1983).) 
<P>
           The Bush bill would codify a set of mitigating and
aggravating factors, provide for a special hearing to determine
whether a sentence of death is justified, and establish an appeals
process.  This meets Supreme Court standards, and would make the
death penalty enforceable.  Bush also would make 30 currently non-
capital federal crimes subject to the death penalty.  These include
kidnapping where a death results, murder during a hostage taking and
terrorist murders of American nationals abroad.

<P>The "Brady Bill."  
<P>
          The so-called "Brady Bill" refers to H.R.7, introduced by
Representative Edward Feighan, the Ohio Democrat, and recently
passed by the House, and is named after Ronald Reagan's former
press secretary James Brady who was wounded in the 1981 attempt
on the President's life.  This bill would require a seven-day waiting
period on handgun purchases.  During this period, gun sellers would
give the prospective buyer's name to the police, who would have the
option of checking to determine, among other things, if the buyer had
a criminal record, a record of mental illness, a history of drug
addiction, or dishonorable discharge from the armed services. 
Although not originally part of his anti-crime plan, Bush has indicated
that he will sign the Brady Bill if it is included in the broader
legislation.  Despite what appears to be the Brady Bill's broad
emotional appeal to Americans, it is doubtful whether it would have
any significant impact.  Some 17 states already have similar or even
more stringent laws and these have not reduced crimes committed
with guns. 
<P>
          Other provisions of the Bush package would: 

<P>Increase the penalties for firearms violations.  
<P>
     The package would increase from five to ten years the
mandatory federal penalty for using a semi-automatic firearm during
a violent felony; provide a mandatory five-year penalty for possession
of a firearm by individuals previously convicted of a violent felony or
serious drug offense; and, prohibit gun magazines that allow firing
over 15 rounds without reloading.

      

<P>Track youth gangs and other juvenile offenders better.  
<P>
     The Bush package would require the FBI to retain fingerprints
and photographs of juveniles convicted of serious federal crimes. 
Currently it does not keep these records.  The package also would
allow juvenile offenders to be prosecuted as adults for certain crimes. 
And it would count serious drug offenses by juveniles as part of their
adult criminal record, making it easier to define them as "career
criminals" under the Armed Career Criminal Act.

<P>Clarify and expand anti-terrorism laws, including
making terrorism an offense under the Racketeer and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) which was originally intended to combat
organized crime.

<P>Make it easier to prosecute sexual assault and child
abuse cases, and stiffen penalties for repeat offenders.  
<P>
     The Bush package would broaden the Federal Rules of
Evidence to allow courts to consider prior sexual and child abuse
offenses by the defendant.  Inasmuch as states usually adopt changes
made in the Federal Rules, this change is likely to be far-reaching.

<P>Provide for drug testing in the criminal justice
system.  
<P>
     Federal convicts placed on parole, probation or post-
imprisonment supervised release would have to submit to drug tests. 
If they are found to be using illegal drugs, they will be jailed.  The
Bush package would also affect state criminal justice systems,
requiring them to institute a vaguely defined drug testing program.
<P>

<B> EVALUATING THE BUSH ANTI-CRIME PACKAGE </B>
<P>
     The most significant parts of the Bush package -- habeas
corpus and exclusionary rule reforms -- are long overdue.  Such
changes would send an important message:  Americans are fed up
with a justice system that shows too much concern for criminals and
not enough for law-abiding citizens.  This is a message that state
legislatures surely will find hard to ignore.  If similarly tough
measures are enacted by states and localities, street crime very likely
would start dropping.
<P>
          The Brady Bill, by contrast, does little but divert
attention from the most serious crime issue:  America's dysfunctional
criminal justice system.  From the founding of the U.S.  until the mid-
1960s, guns were readily available, yet murder rates remained
minuscule compared to those of today.  What changed from the mid-
1960s onward was not the availability of handguns, but the nature of
the criminal justice system.  It stopped working efficiently. 
<P>
           Most of the Bush package is sound, focusing on federal
criminal matters without further interfering with state and local crime
prevention efforts.  Bush could have made an even greater
contribution to fighting crime, however, if he had told the American
people that the best place to fight crime is at the state and local level. 
Instead, he has left the misleading impression that his crime package
will seriously attack the problem, thus giving credence to the idea that
Washington can solve the crime problem, an idea belied by the
specific provisions of Bush's own package.
<P>

<B> THE BIDEN PACKAGE </B>
<P>
     One of Biden's bills, S.15, ostensibly seeks to combat violence
against women, while Biden's omnibus bill, S.618, covers some of the
issues in the Bush bill.  Biden would expand the number of crimes
eligible for the death penalty and increase federal penalties for gun-
related crimes.  Measures in the Biden package include: 

<P>Money for Drug Prisons. 
<P>
          Biden proposes $600 million to build, and $100 million
to operate, a new system of regional federal prisons capable of
holding 12,000 prisoners.  The regional prisons would accept from
state systems violent offenders with drug abuse histories and less than
two years left on their sentences.  At the regional facilities, the
prisoners would receive drug treatment.  States would reimburse the
federal government for 100 percent of the cost of those prisoners who
fail to complete the drug treatment program, and 75 percent for those
who do complete it. 

<P>An ROTC for Police.
<P>
          The U.S.  military offers Reserve Officers Training
Corps (ROTC) on many college campuses, paying part of the college
tuition of students who promise to devote a certain number of years
to the military after graduation.  Biden proposes $430 million
annually in federal funds to create and finance an ROTC-type
program for police officers.  The Police Corps Program, as it is to be
called, would offer scholarships to college students who agree to work
in a state or local police force for four years after graduation.  The
federal government would pay for education only.  States and
localities would guarantee police positions for graduates and pay
salaries.

<P>Boot Camps.
<P>
          The Biden package would establish 10 federal military-
style boot camp prisons, each to accommodate between 200 and 300
young first offenders and drug abusers.  The theory is that boot
camps, with their tough discipline and absence of career criminals,
could prevent young people from become repeat offenders. ( See,
Billie S.  Erwin and Lawrence A.  Bennett, "New Dimensions in
Probation:  Georgia's Intensive Probation Supervision," National
Institute of Justice, 1987.) 

<P>Violence Against Women Act.
<P>
          To reduce violence against women, despite statistics
that confirm that men are far more likely than women to be the
victims of violence, Biden has introduced The Safe Homes for
Women Act.  It states that, "Any person who travels or causes
another...  to travel across state lines or in interstate commerce with
the intent to injure an intimate partner" and who does injure that
person can be jailed for up to 20 years. ( S.  15, section 211.) 
<P>
           This bill's price tag is almost $560 million a year, spent
mainly on grants to states, Indian tribes, cities, and other localities "to
develop effective law enforcement and prosecution strategies to
combat violence against women."  This includes training police and
prosecutors to identify crimes against women, such as sexual assault
and domestic violence; and developing training and expanding units
in police departments and prosecutors' offices that specifically target
violent crimes against women.  Up to $100 million each year would
be spent in areas of "high intensity crime" against women.  Another
$190 million a year would be used for general grants to the states,
and $10 million would be authorized to combat crime against women
in the Indian tribes. 
<P>
           The bill explicitly makes wife-beating a federal crime
for any person who travels across state lines and "does an act that
injures his or her spouse or intimate partner."  Biden thus implies that
the FBI should become involved in what hitherto has been a matter
for local police.  When added to laws that already involve the federal
government in local law enforcement, such as those laws aimed at
arresting street drug dealers, this continues the trend of replacing the
local cop with federal law enforcement officers. 
<P>
           Among other provisions of the Biden package:

<P>Establish new task forces and commissions and
require agencies to file ten new reports to Congress.  
<P>
          Among the new reports would be those that 1) would
measure whether banning assault weapons reduces violence and drug
trafficking; 2) would track the progress of the proposed Police Corps
along with a separate, special report which would recommend
whether to expand the program; 3) would review the efficiency of
traditional criminal justice approaches to preventing crime and
violence through findings of the Commission on Crime and Violence,
and the findings of the National Commission on Violent Crime
Against Women, which would evaluate the adequacy of current
efforts to reduce the rate of violent crimes against women; and, 4)
would identify problems of record keeping of criminal complaints
involving domestic violence. 

<P>Amend the U.S.  Sentencing Commission guidelines to
double the federal penalties for repeat sex offenders and increases
them on first-time rapists.  
<P>
<P>Provide money to reduce crime in public parks, mass
transit and national parks.  
<P>
          The bill would authorize up to $35 million for lighting
and surveillance cameras in such places as bus stops, parking lots,
subway stations and recreation areas.  Money may also be spent to
install emergency phone lines, hire additional security personnel, and
for "any other project intended to increase security and safety."  Up to
$10 million would go to states and local public bodies or agencies to
cut crime in public transportation, $15 million to the National Park
System; and $10 million to states for use in public parks.

<P>Create new rules of evidence to make it more
difficult to question in court an alleged victim about her sexual
history. 
<P>
          Under Biden's law, reputation or opinion evidence of
the past sexual behavior of an alleged victim would not be admissible
unless the defendant intends to offer evidence of specific instances of
past sexual behavior and notifies the court in writing at least 15 days
before the trial.  Then a hearing would be held in which the judge
determines whether the evidence is relevant and outweighs the
danger of unfair prejudice against the victim.  If it meets those
criteria, it may be admitted at trial.  Currently, many courts lack
procedures to prevent juries from hearing the embarrassing, yet not
necessarily relevant, disclosures of the alleged victim's sexual history.

<P>De Facto Racial Quotas for the Death Penalty.
<P>
          In what Biden calls the Racial Justice Act of 1991,
Section 2922(a), states:  "No person shall be put to death...  if that
person's death furthers a racially discriminatory pattern." ( S.  618,
Chapter 177, section 2922 (a).)  This means that if 70 percent of all
murderers are white, then 70 percent of all death penalties must be
carried out against white people.  Importantly, it also means that if 80
percent of all murder victims are black, 80 percent of all death
penalties must be carried out against people who murder blacks.  If a
contrary statistical pattern emerges, the Biden bill stipulates the
government must show through "clear and convincing evidence" that
non-racial factors "persuasively" explain the disparity.  Thus, a new
round of trials, hearings and appeals would be tacked on to already
lengthy criminal procedures and protections.  Justice no longer would
aim solely at punishing an individual criminal for his or her individual
crime.
<P>
 <B> EVALUATING THE BIDEN PACKAGE </B>
<P>
     The Biden bills will cost taxpayers almost $4 billion a year. 
Yet there is little indication that this spending significantly would
reduce violent crime.  Example:  Of the $1 billion meant for state
and local law enforcement, New York City's share would probably
place no more than two additional policemen on the street per shift,
per precinct. 
<P>
           The other spending provisions also are unlikely to
reduce crime rates noticeably.  The drug prisons will hold only 12,000. 
The boot camps for young, first-time offenders will hold only a
maximum of 3,000 inmates.  The Biden package thus would do little
to ease prison overcrowding.  It is estimated, for example, that the
states need an extra 500,000 spaces for prisoners.  As bad, the Biden
package ignores a key proposal to help states with overcrowded
prisons:  H.R.  1001 sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde, the
Illinois Republican, would change the federal tax code to allow tax
exempt state bonds issued to finance private prisons.  Biden failed to
include a similar measure which would combat the high cost of
constructing and maintaining new facilities.
<P>
          In contrast to most of the Biden package, the proposal
for a ROTC-like program to train 20,000 police annually has merit. 
College educated police tend to set higher standards for themselves. 
No new funds, however, need to be spent on this ROTC.  The $430
million annual cost of the program should be paid with money
currently available in the Department of Education budget.
<P>
          Biden's legislation is not the major assault on America's
crime problem that he claims; it is not even a minor assault.  If his
real goal is to encourage experimentation, then he should leave this
to the states, which traditionally have been America's best
laboratories of social experiment. 
<P>
           Biden's package, moreover, errs seriously in increasing
federal involvement in the fight against violent street crime.  Fighting
crime -- like collecting garbage, fire-fighting or lighting streets -- is a
state and local responsibility.  Entangling the federal government in
the battle against street crime muddies the lines of responsibility and
creates confusion over which officials should be held accountable for
the local crime situation.  If citizens want another policeman on their
block, they should not have to call their Congressman, who might
then try to prod a lethargic federal bureaucracy. 
<P>

 <B> HOW THE STATES CAN FIGHT CRIME </B>
<P>
      Crime is the ultimate local problem.  Often attacker and
victim come from the same neighborhood, and almost always from
the same city or county.  Localities, moreover, fight crime differently. 
This leads to experiments that reveal what works and what does not.
<P>
          States should encourage such innovation by their cities
and counties.  States also can take other actions to bolster local
police effectiveness.  For one thing, states might spend more money
on prosecutors and judges if the courts are the source of delays in
criminal proceedings.  This would make real to criminals the threat of
a trial, conviction and punishment. 
<P>
           For another thing, states can add prison capacity.  If
funds are short, the states could turn to private companies to
construct and operate prisons.  In Louisiana and Kentucky, among
other states, this has cut costs.  Indeed, a National Institute of Justice
study conservatively estimated savings at between 4 percent and 15
percent in privately run prisons. ( Charles H.  Logan and Bill W. 
McGriff, "Comparing Costs of Public and Private Prisons:  A Case
Study," NIJ Reports, National Institute of Justice, U.S.  Department
of Justice, September/October 1989.)  With such savings possible,
state and local governments could afford to build more cells each
year.
<P>

<B> CONCLUSION </B>
<P>
     The antidote to violent street crime lies in the hands of state
and local officials and the voters who elect them.  States and
localities can hire more judges, prosecutors and public defenders; can
appoint and elect judges who will enforce the law rather than bend
the state constitutions to favor criminals; and can hire private firms to
build and manage their prisons.       
<P>
          The federal government, of course, has a role in
fighting crime.  It can keep interstate criminal records such as
photographs and fingerprints, maintain nationwide crime statistics,
continue to research high technology police methods, and handle such
interstate problems as organized crime.  But, the day-to-day police
work, prosecutions and imprisonments must be left to local
authorities.  Washington-based officials know this.  They thus should
stop misleading voters by claiming that the federal government can
have a big impact on violent street crime.
<P>
          Of the two major crime packages being considered by
Congress, the Bush version is the better.  It makes reasonable
proposals to ensure that the guilty go to jail, and once in jail, restrains
convicts from jamming the federal courts with frivolous habeas corpus
petitions.  Furthermore, the Bush package does not inject the federal
government significantly into local problems.
<P>
          By contrast, the Biden package assumes that
Washington can solve America's crime problems if only the federal
government spends enough money.  It unduly would expand,
moreover, the role of federal law enforcement in local crime fighting
-- something that if done on a small scale will have little impact, and
if done on a large scale, can threaten civil liberties.  And the Biden
package actually takes a racial quota approach to death penalty
executions.
<P>
          The principal job of government is to protect the life,
liberty and property of the citizens.  Crime prevention thus is a
matter demanding the highest attention of government.  But it is at
the state and local level that the criminal justice system, from the
policeman on the street to the judges in the courtroom to the prison,
succeeds or fails in its task.  More direct federal intervention, as
mandated by the Biden package, would add more confusion and
bureaucracy, making the crime problem not better, but worse.<P>

<title>An Empowerment Strategy for Eliminating Neighborhood Crime -- Heritage</title>

<h3> AN EMPOWERMENT STRATEGY FOR ELIMINATING NEIGHBORHOOD CRIME </h3>

By Carl F. Horowitz, Ph.D.<BR>
 Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 814<br>
March 25, 1991<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>




<B> INTRODUCTION</B><P>
     A common and false allegation about urban life in America is that
conditions in poor neighborhoods "force" residents into a life of
crime. This view initially gained popularity after the urban rioting
of the 1960s, specifically in the report of the National Advisory
Commission on Civil Disorders, better known as the Kerner Commission
Report. 
<P>
While some criminologists hold that poor neighborhoods are
"breeding grounds" for crime, evidence shows these experts actually
reverse the real sequence of events. It is not that poverty in general
breeds crime; it is crime, especially violent crime, that exacerbates
poverty in neighborhoods. (See data in John J. DiLulio, Jr., "The
Impact of Inner-City Crime," The Public Interest, Number 96, Summer
1989, pp. 28-46.) Crime makes not only the victim, but also the
neighborhood poorer. Crime sets in motion a cycle of flight by law-
abiding citizens, and disinvestment in housing and business; this then
triggers further flight that devastates the poorest neighborhoods and
communities, dooming to failure even well-designed anti-poverty
efforts. 
<P>
     Ultimate Tax. Writes former Director of the National Institute of
Justice, James K. Stewart: "Crime is the ultimate tax on enterprise.
It must be reduced or eliminated before poor people can fully share in
the American dream." (James K. Stewart, "The Urban Strangler: How
Crime Causes Poverty in the Inner City," Policy Review, Number 37,
Summer 1986, p. 8.) Controlling crime is a precondition to improving
the lives of the urban poor because no neighborhood can grow
economically unless it is first safe. As sociologist Charles Murray,
Visiting Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, notes, the key
to reducing crime is to create an atmosphere of lawfulness. (Charles
Murray, "Crime in America," National Review, June 10, 1988, p. 35.)
Low-income neighborhoods explicitly should project the message to the
would-be criminal, whether a resident or not, that crime is not
tolerated, that moral principles are observed and enforced. 
<P>
     Government at all levels must launch an aggressive strategy to
create such an atmosphere if a national urban anti-poverty effort is
to succeed. This strategy especially should explore ways of involving
the law-abiding urban poor in anti-crime activities. In this
empowerment strategy, the poor themselves work with police and other
local officials to identify sources of potential crime and restrict
access of potential criminals to their neighborhoods and housing
projects. In particular:<ul>
<P>
<li> Local governments should help neighborhood groups form anti-crime
     patrols, stimulate interest among residents in joining existing
     patrols, and hire private guards to augment the activities of
     local police forces. Public housing projects as well as more
     traditional neighborhoods should be the focus of such efforts.
<P><li>
     State legislatures should require stricter sentencing for repeat
     offenders and for all offenders convicted of using firearms in
     committing a burglary or robbery.
<P><li>
     The federal government should beef up the efforts of cabinet-
     level agencies, particularly the Department of Justice and the
     Department of Housing and Urban Development, to stem violent
     crime and drug dealing in housing projects. 
<P><li>
     Congress should make real the threat to stop funding the Legal
     Services Corporation if this agency continues to defend the
     "civil rights" of drug dealers facing eviction from public
     housing. 
<P><li>
     Most important by far, the President and the rest of the federal
     government should emphasize to the American public and
     particularly to the minority community that crime is less the
     outcome of poverty than its cause, and that until strenuous and
     innovative efforts are taken to defeat crime in the inner city
     anti-poverty programs cannot succeed.</ul>
<P>

<B> CRIME AND THE LOW-INCOME URBAN POOR: THE HIDDEN COSTS</B>
<P>
     Crime is increasing rapidly in America's cities. By November of
last year, eight of the twenty largest cities already had set new
records for homicides in a single year. (These and all other
statistics on crime incidence, unless otherwise noted, are derived
from local police departments and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports, released semi-annually and
annually. The data reflect only those crimes reported to law
enforcement agencies, not necessarily the total crimes committed. The
crimes are separated into violent crimes (murder, forcible rape,
robbery, and aggravated assault) and property crimes (burglary,
larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson).) By year's end, New
York City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Boston easily had broken
records set in 1989. The more than 2,200 people murdered in New York
City alone represented a more than 10 percent increase over the 1989
figure. In Washington, D.C., the 434 murders in 1989 and 483 murders
in 1990 amounted to one murder for about every 1,400 residents. 
<P>
     Horror stories abound. In Detroit, an annual pre-Halloween arson
rampage, customarily known as "Devil's Night," torched hundreds of
buildings this October 29th through 31st, despite maximum precautions
taken by local officials. ("Halloween Fires, Arrests Rose in Detroit,"
Washington Times, November 5, 1990.) Remarked one resident living next
to a home that burned two years ago, "I'm afraid. It's like you're a
prisoner in your own house. I wouldn't go out." ("Detroit Pulls Out
All Stops to Foil Arson on Devil's Night," Washington Times, October
31, 1990.) 
<P>
     Most obvious, of course, are the immediate costs of crime; the
victim's injuries or loss of some wealth. The poor usually suffer most
not just because they have little wealth to lose but also because they
live in neighborhoods where crimes are common. Less obvious but often
more important, are the indirect costs of crime, affecting not only
the person robbed but anybody living in the same neighborhood. These
indirect costs are of two types: crime that creates poverty among the
innocent, whether or not they have been actual crime victims, and
crime that creates poverty among criminals. 
<P>

<B> How The Innocent Pay</B>
<P>
     Fear of crime forces innocent people into forms of behavior that
would be unnecessary in a crime-free environment. The fear of being
beaten, robbed, or murdered can make it impossible for residents of a
crime-infested neighborhood to become productive employees or business
owners. Writes the National Institute of Justice's Stewart: "The
traditional means by which poor people have advanced themselves --
overtime, moonlighting, education to improve future opportunities --
can be easily obstructed by crime and fear. Why risk a late job or
night school if the return home means waiting at deserted bus stops
and walking past crowds of threatening teenagers?" (Stewart, "The
Urban Strangler," p. 6.)
<P>
     Perhaps nothing illustrates the fear gripping so many of today's
low-income urban neighborhoods than the construction by the City of
Los Angeles of a concrete wall around one of its junior high schools
to keep stray bullets from hitting children on the playground. (James
Q. Wilson and John J. DiLulio, Jr., "Crackdown," New Republic, July
10, 1989, p. 21.) 
<P>
     Depressing Property Values. Fear of criminals depresses the
willingness of families to move into and stay in neighborhoods. This
then depresses property values. If potential buyers of property,
whether occupied or vacant, believe that it is in a high-crime
neighborhood, they offer a lower price for the property than they
would have in the absence of crime. (For evidence that crime hurts
property values, see Wesley G. Skogan, Disorder and Decline: Crime and
the Spiral of Decay in American Neighborhoods (New York: Free Press,
1990), pp. 65-84. See also R. P. Taub, Paths of Neighborhood Change:
Race and Crime in Urban America (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
1984).) 
<P>
     This has a devastating effect on the poor. If they are homeowners
-- many poor own their own homes (Thirty-eight percent of America's
below-poverty-line households own their own homes, and 58 percent of
these are non-elderly. See Robert Rector, Kate Walsh O'Beirne, and
Michael McLaughlin, "How 'Poor' Are America's Poor?" Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder No. 791, September 21, 1990, p. 9.) -- their
principal asset is devalued. This is the equivalent of criminals
robbing a family's savings account. If residents are apartment owners,
they may be unable to find any buyers when they wish to sell, and they
have difficulty finding responsible renters. This in turn discourages
the landlord from spending money on maintenance, which in turn
triggers the cycle of crime and further decay.
<P>
     Housing Stock Deteriorates. Even those owners who want to improve
their property are deterred by crime. Since crime reduces property
values, homeowners and apartment owners alike may find it very
difficult to obtain credit for purchase or improvement loans. The
result: The housing stock deteriorates despite intentions of owners.
Much of the "redlining" allegedly practiced by mortgage lenders (a
practice by which lenders designate certain neighborhoods as too risky
for loans) actually is a rational response to fears that falling real
property values will impose a huge loss on the lenders in the event of
default. For this reason even creditworthy borrowers in such
neighborhoods are denied the capital to improve their properties.
Explains a resident of a heavily vandalized Chicago neighborhood: "If
you tell a bank that it is the Wicker Park area you want to buy into,
they'll refuse you credit." (Skogan, Disorder and Decline, p. 79.)
<P>
     Enormous Burdens. The resulting property deterioration and
subsequent abandonment is documented in every urban neighborhood in
America where criminals reign. It is especially true in public
housing. In Chicago, for example, over 5,000 publicly-owned dwellings
stand vacant, most as a result of vandalism and youth gang violence.
(John McCormick, "Can Chicago Beat the Odds?" Newsweek, January, 2,
1989, pp. 24-26.) In New Orleans' decaying Desire housing project,
sixteen residents were slain in just the first nine months of 1990.
(Guy Gugliotta and Michael Isikoff, "Violence in the '90s: Drugs'
Deadly Residue," Washington Post, October 14, 1990.)
<P>
     Tallied among crime's costs too are the higher taxes paid by all
of a city's residents, including those in high-crime neighborhoods,
because of the heavy cost of police protection and running courts,
jails, and prisons. Violent crime also imposes enormous burdens on the
health and social service systems. 
<P>
     In cities of more than 500,000 people, police, fire protection,
and social service portions of municipal budgets not only rose rapidly
during the 1980s, they did so at rates well exceeding the overall
municipal budgets. (U.S. Bureau of the Census, City Government
Finances, Series GF, No. 4 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing
Office), annually.) In Washington, D.C., during 1982-1987, for
example, expenditures for these three combined areas rose by 66.2
percent, compared with the increase for the entire local budget of
43.3 percent. 
<P>
     Crime-Expenditure Linkage. Yet when local governments respond to
the costs of crime by raising taxes or fees, they risk driving out
law-abiding residents and businesses. Cities faced with high crime
rates typically face heavy tax burdens. An analysis of crime and taxes
over a 30-year period by Northwestern University political scientist
Herbert Jacob reveals just how close the crime-expenditure linkage is.
While all cities in a ten-city survey showed large increases in police
expenditures, by far the ones with the largest increases were the ones
with the highest increases in crime rates. (Herbert Jacob, "Policy
Responses to Crime," in Paul Peterson, ed., The New Urban Reality
(Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1985), pp. 225-52.)
<P>
     Another cost of crime is that employers are reluctant to expand
or relocate in high-crime neighborhoods even if given economic
development incentives. When an office, store, or factory is said to
be in a dangerous neighborhood, employers have difficulties finding
and retaining a work force. The evidence on business location
decisions shows that fear of crime strongly encourages employers to
avoid establishing facilities in poor neighborhoods or to relocate
existing facilities to safer neighborhoods or jurisdictions. (Stewart,
"The Urban Strangler," p. 7; DiLulio, "The Impact of Inner-City
Crime.") If the firm compensates for the fears of employees by
offering higher wages and salaries, its labor costs rise, hence making
it less competitive with firms outside such areas. 
<P>
     Losing Neighborhood Businesses. Local residents, fearing crime,
are unwilling to patronize neighborhood businesses during evening
hours. Business owners may be willing to bear the risk of crime in
order to attract evening customers, but if residents are too
frightened to shop, many of the businesses will not survive. As a
result, many inner city residents no longer enjoy the convenience of
having neighborhood stores. A lengthy trip thus may be required for
groceries, clothing, and other household goods. 
<P>
     New small businesses in high-crime areas often cannot obtain
property insurance or small business loans except at high rates -- if
at all. Small business in New York City alone loses about $1 billion a
year from arson, shoplifting, burglary, robbery, and other crimes.
(Cited in George F. Will, "Giuliani: He's No Fiorello," Washington
Post, October 26, 1989.) Such crimes can be calamities for inner city
businesses. The recent default by investors in a commercial mall in a
high-crime area in the Northeast section of Washington, D.C.,
underscores how retail activity housed in a new, attractive complex,
even with substantial pre-opening publicity, may not be able to
survive.
<P>
     When fear of crime drives out or cuts back the hours of
neighborhood enterprises, employment opportunities shrink. This is
especially harmful to teenagers seeking their first jobs. If they are
to enjoy productive lives as adults, avoiding the welfare dependency
trap, they must develop marketable skills before they enter adulthood.
<P>
     Fear in Schools. Urban schools deteriorate. According to Karl
Zinsmeister, crime and education expert at the American Enterprise
Institute, each year about 3 million crimes are attempted or completed
inside schools or on school grounds. (Karl Zinsmeister, "Growing Up
Scared," Atlantic, June 1990, p. 61. All the educational data here
come from this article.) Assaults alone constitute about 10 percent of
these offenses. The response to the climate of fear by some children
is to avoid school altogether. A significant portion of today's
truancy problem, observes Zinsmeister, results from a child's fear of
being terrorized. He notes that about 8 percent of all urban junior
and senior high school students miss at least one day of classes each
month because they fear physical assault by other students. It is not
simply students who are fearful. According to Zinsmeister, about one
in five teachers are assaulted on the job each year, with 12 percent
hesitant to confront the guilty party for fear of reprisal. Not
surprisingly, talented and ambitious teachers will avoid transfers to
crime-ridden schools, reducing the ability of the school to provide a
good education.
<P>
<B> How Even Criminals Eventually Pay</B>
<P>
     When a criminal robs a business owner or pedestrian of cash, or
receives hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a single drug deal,
naturally he feels this beats what he may see as a low-paying "dead
end" job. As Robert J. DeFauw, former Director of the Detroit office
of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), noted in 1984: "Our
major problem is, how are we going to reach these kids? I mean, do you
tell them to work at J.L. Hudson's for $45 a week when they're making
$2,000 a week selling drugs on the street? They'll just laugh at you."
(Howard Blum, "U.S. Helps Detroit to Attack Drug Rings," New York
Times, January 28, 1984.) His words remain applicable today.
<P>
     Despite what appear to be financial advantages for the criminal,
the evidence shows that he or she, too, ultimately becomes a victim.
This is true for several reasons.
<P>
     First, an inner city criminal career often leads to serious
injury or death. In Washington, D.C., for example, police estimate
that over half of the murders in their jurisdiction during 1985-1988
involved a dispute between drug dealers. (U.S. News and World-Report,
"Dead Zones," Special Report, April 10, 1989, p. 25.) 
<P>
     Second, while an individual crime results in incarceration less
than 2 percent of the time, (U.S. Department of Justice, Federal
Bureau of Investigation, Crime in the United States (Washington, D.C.:
U.S. Government Printing Office), annually.) a teenage criminal faces
strong odds of eventually being arrested and convicted if he maintains
his activity into his 20s. This is because street crime requires
almost daily activity to be profitable. It takes several felonies each
week just to rob the equivalent of what could be earned honestly at a
modest job. (Samuel Walker, Sense and Nonsense About Crime: A Policy
Guide, 2nd ed. (Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole, 1989), p. 258.) The
odds catch up with many. Over 3.5 million American adults are on
parole or on probation in addition to the 700,000 currently in state
or federal prisons. (U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice
Statistics, Probation and Parole 1987, Bulletin NCJ-113948, and
Probation and Parole 1988, Bulletin NCJ-113948, reprinted in U.S.
Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Sourcebook of
Criminal Justice Statistics -- 1989 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department
of Justice, 1990), p. 556.) 
<P>
     Aside from the loss of potential income while in prison, an adult
with a criminal record once released finds himself unemployable in
many jobs. According to a Justice Department study, some 40 percent of
ex-prisoners who have been free for under one year make less than $500
monthly. (U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,
Profile of State Prison Inmates 1986, Special Report NCJ-109926
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Justice, January 1988), p. 3.)
With the range of legitimate employment choices diminished, the
temptation to return to the streets is greater. Over 60 percent of
criminals released from prison are rearrested for another offense
within three years, and most of them are convicted. (U.S. Department
of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Recidivism of Prisoners
Released in 1983, Special Report NCJ-116261 (Washington, D.C.: U.S.
Department of Justice, April 1989), p. 5.) According to Washington,
D.C., Police Chief Isaac Fulwood, it is common for the same person,
once out of prison, to be arrested eight or nine times in the same
neighborhood within weeks. (DiLulio, "The Impact of Inner-City Crime,"
p. 40.) 
<P>
     Third, a criminal's frequent refusal to finish high school
severely reduces lifetime earning capacity. (U.S. Department of
Justice, Recidivism of Prisoners, p. 5. According to this study, 67.3
percent of all sampled released adult prisoners had less than a high
school degree. In fact, close to 20 percent had no education beyond
the 8th grade.) Recent studies show that the decision to drop out of
high school reduces the individual's income over the long run, and
increases the likelihood of unemployment. (Michael McLaughlin, "High
School Dropouts: How Much of a Crisis?" Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 781, August 3, 1990, pp. 8-9; Wayne J. Howe, "Do
Education and Demographics Affect Unemployment Rates?" Monthly Labor
Review, Vol. 111, No. 1, January 1988, pp. 3-9; James P. Markey, "The
Labor Problems of Today's High School Dropouts," Monthly Labor Review,
Vol. 111, No. 6, June 1988, pp. 36-43.) About one in six high school
dropouts are unemployed, a rate roughly triple to that of the general
labor force. (Markey, "The Labor Problems of Today's High School
Dropouts," p. 36.) 
<P>
     The lack of education and the decision to pursue a criminal
career reinforce each other. Just as poor performance in school makes
a life of crime more attractive, a young criminal's initially
successful forays into crime induce him to believe that education
"isn't worth it." This is especially true among minors, because even
if convicted of an offense, they rarely get more punishment than a
warning. Typically, they conclude that crime does pay. (For recent
evidence, see "Kids and Crime," Special Report, Insight, July 30,
1990, pp. 9-13.) 
<P>
     Fourth, criminals are less likely than others to develop the
personality and values necessary for entering into and sustaining a
marriage. They tend to marry less -- fewer than half of the adult
inmates in state prisons ever have been married. (U.S. Department of
Justice, Profile of State Prison Inmates 1986, p. 3.) A stable
marriage not only has the capacity to induce a man to be gainfully
employed, it also steers him away from crime. (See Marvin E. Wolfgang,
Terence P. Thornberry, and Robert M. Figlio, From Boy to Man, from
Delinquency to Crime (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), pp.
138-43. The authors found that while marriage significantly reduces a
man's willingness to lead a life of crime, merely cohabitating with a
woman and/or fathering her child do not.) If during a marriage, a man
remains a criminal, or reverts to being one, the odds are substantial
that his wife will leave him. With this realization, a man who values
a marriage avoids crime. Equally important, his children are less
likely to become criminals if he stays with his wife. (The evidence is
persuasive that children and teenagers are less likely to grow up with
problems of mental illness, violence, drug use, and poor school
performance when both parents are present in the home. For a review of
recent studies, see Nicholas Davidson, "Life Without Father: America's
Greatest Social Catastrophe," Policy Review, Number 51, Winter 1990,
pp. 40-44.)
<P>

<B> HOW TO REDUCE NEIGHBORHOOD CRIME</B>
<P>
     There is a growing realization that the best strategies for
fighting crime in residential neighborhoods are those where the police
work closely with resident organizations. Such community-based
strategies require residents to believe that others in their
neighborhood are committed to a crime-free environment. Then they will
be more willing to take part in public or private anti-crime programs,
and be mobilized by police forces. "Community-oriented policing," as
this is known, attempts to prevent crimes rather than investigate them
after the fact. As crime experts James Q. Wilson, Collins Professor of
Management at UCLA, and George Kelling, Fellow at Harvard's John F.
Kennedy School of Government, write:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Community-oriented policing means changing the daily work of
     the police to include investigating problems as well as
     incidents. It means defining as a problem whatever a
     significant body of public opinion regards as a threat to
     community order. It means working with the good guys, and
     not just against the bad guys. (James Q. Wilson and George
     L. Kelling, "Making Neighborhoods Safe," Atlantic, February
     1989, p. 49.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Community groups and police forces now have a considerable body
of experience drawn from successful experiments in community-oriented
policing. This evidence suggests that several tactics are key to a
successful approach, and that government policies can help in a number
of ways. Among these:
<P>
1) Create more police foot patrols. 
<P>
     The evidence indicates that deploying more foot patrol police
officers in a high-crime neighborhood can make substantial headway
against crime. Charleston, South Carolina, is a case in point. (Edwin
Meese III and Bob Carrico, "Taking Back the Streets," Policy Review,
Number 54, Fall 1990, pp. 26-27; Suzanne Fields, "Safer with Fleetfeet
on the Beat," Washington Times, November 8, 1990.) When Reuben
Greenberg in 1982 took over as Police Chief of that city of 80,000, he
inherited one of the nation's most crime-ridden cities for its size.
One of his first steps to tackle the problem was to create an elite
unit of foot patrolmen. Friendly and cooperative with neighbors, yet
tough and agile enough to chase and catch a fleeing suspect, these
patrolmen have deterred criminals, especially drug dealers, from
preying on poor neighborhoods.
<P>
     Under Greenberg, crime in Charleston has fallen 42 percent. So
successful is his strategy viewed that he was invited early last year
by Mobile, Alabama, with a population of 200,000, to design a similar
program for that city. Five months after Mobile adopted the Greenberg
plan, Mobile's serious crime fell by 18 percent. (Ed Foster-Simeon, "A
Matter of Taking Back City Streets," Washington Times, November 6,
1990.)
<P>
     Results from other cities are also encouraging. In Flint,
Michigan, a city of nearly 150,000, foot patrol officers since 1979
have been trained to refer citizens to social service agencies when
the police detect domestic problems or alcohol and drug abuse. The
idea is to prevent residents with such problems from falling into a
pattern of crime. In the fourteen experimental areas established by
the Flint police as high-crime districts, crime rates declined an
average of 8 percent in the first three years of the program; by
contrast, rates rose 10 percent in areas without the program. (Meese
and Carrico, "Taking Back the Streets," pp. 23-24.) In Los Angeles, a
foot patrol program, Secured Areas Footbeat Enforcement (SAFE), begun
last year but now discontinued due to budget cuts, was popular in
several of that city's poorer neighborhoods.

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Foot patrol programs have proven to be a successful method of
deterring street crime. The U.S. Justice Department and state justice
departments should consider making law enforcement assistance to
localities contingent upon local government at least exploring the
merits of a police or private guard foot patrol program. 
<P>
2) Create citizen patrols. 
<P>
     Unarmed community volunteers, working together and with the local
police force also seem able to deter street crime. Like police foot
patrols, their presence itself warns drug dealers and other criminals
that the neighborhood has been put "off-limits."
<P>
     A good example is in Washington, D.C., where more than 130
neighborhood crime watch groups involve about 6,000 residents. In
several neighborhoods, residents armed with video cameras and walkie-
talkies film drug transactions and write down license plate numbers,
later relaying the information to the police. The aim is to target
drug customers rather than dealers, and thus to reduce the demand for
drugs. Their effort has closed dozens of crack houses and reduced
open-air drug dealing. Other Washington neighborhoods have expressed
enthusiasm for similar groups.          
<P>
     Establishing community patrols makes residents appreciate their
own power to change the neighborhood. Explains Jim Foreman,
coordinator of the Metro Orange Coalition, the umbrella organization
for local crime watch groups in Washington, "Usually when you go out
to see a group, they are afraid about what is on the street. Once you
get them there, they see the power of togetherness, what they can do."
(Mark Vane, "Community Patrols Help in Drug War," Washington Times,
November 26, 1990.)
<P>
     The Guardian Angels pioneered such neighborhood patrols. The
organization first gained national attention a decade ago for their
efforts in fighting crime in New York City's subways. No volunteer
organization has done more to make America's streets less dangerous.
With dozens of active chapters, the Guardian Angels are scrupulous
about maintaining good relations with local police. They enter a
community only at the invitation of residents. They have substantially
reduced crime in a number of Washington, D.C.-area apartment
complexes. ("Apartment Security Is Heaven-Sent," Insight, June 4,
1990, pp. 20-22.) The Angels have worked hard at building a reservoir
of good will among public officials. Francis Keating, General Counsel
for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),
acknowledges that they are a key element in HUD's Drug Elimination
Program, which makes available grants to housing authorities to assist
in the elimination of drug-related crime in public housing projects.
(Ibid., p. 22.)
<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Governments should seek ways to establish citizen crime patrol
programs in low-income neighborhoods. The bureaucratic obstacles to
such arrangements have been overcome where neighborhood groups and
police work closely. HUD, for example, works with housing authorities
around the country in providing technical assistance to tenant anti-
crime patrols. In Baltimore, for instance, elderly residents in the
city's public housing projects, with walkie-talkies, report to local
police suspicious and illegal behavior they see. 
<P>
     Localities should encourage low-income resident associations to
take the lead in establishing patrols. Beside patrolling, these
patrols could provide literature to neighborhood residents to
encourage them to leave on their lights at night, trim their shrubs
and bushes for greater visibility, and arrange for the Post Office not
to deliver mail when they are out of town. These groups also could
give city building inspection and police departments information on
vacant dwellings, especially those that may function as drug houses.
<P>
3) Make public housing safe. 
<P>
     Crime rates in public housing projects tend to exceed the city
average. Thus, while Chicago's serious crime rate already is almost
quadruple the national average, the rate in three of its most
notorious projects -- Cabrini-Green, Stateway Gardens, and Rockwell
Gardens -- ranges from double to quadruple even that of the whole
city. (McCormick, "Can Chicago Beat the Odds?") 
<P>
     In the late-1980s, federal and local agencies began taking
decisive action to tackle public housing project crime. HUD Secretary
Jack Kemp was prompted to do so after the March 1989 murder of an
Alexandria, Virginia, police officer who tackled a crack dealer
holding a tenant hostage in a public housing project. It subsequently
was learned that other project residents knew that the apartment long
had been used for drug dealing and had complained to housing
officials. Complex eviction procedures, however, had made it
impossible to remove the drug-dealing tenants. Under this procedure,
it normally took one to two years to evict someone from public
housing. Since the Alexandria murder, HUD has waived these eviction
requirements for close to 40 states and the District of Columbia.
(James P. Moran, Jr., "High Noon in Alexandria: How We Ran the Crack
Dealers Out of Public Housing," Policy Review, Number 53, Summer 1990,
pp. 78-81.)
<P>
     A police response to public housing tenant requests for better
protection can reduce crime. When the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA)
in late 1988 asked police to raid suspected gang hideouts and crack
dens in one of the Rockwell Gardens buildings, violence dropped
dramatically, and residents no longer felt they had to sleep in
closets and bathtubs for safety from flying bullets. (McCormick, "Can
Chicago Beat the Odds?" pp. 24-25. For an excellent full treatment of
reforms recently undertaken in Chicago's public housing program, see
Andrew Cooper, Enabling the Underclass: Vince Lane's Campaign to
Restore Rights and Responsibilities in Chicago's Public Housing,
Public Entrepreneurship Series, No. 2 (Washington, D.C.: Progressive
Policy Institute, December 1990).) CHA Director Vincent Lane vows to
make every project free of gangs and drugs. Similar results were
reported in a get-tough program started by Omaha's Housing Authority.
(Robert L. Armstrong, "Something Upbeat Is Going On in Omaha's Public
Housing," Governing, December 1990, pp. 36-41.)

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Public housing authorities should establish comprehensive
programs to combat crime and drug abuse in public housing. These
programs should include better screening of prospective tenants;
neighborhood foot patrols; information-sharing with police and housing
authorities on criminals, suspected drug activity, and vacant
apartments; and tenant drug education and referral outreach services. 
<P>
     In each program, tenant involvement is critical. Without it, the
fear established by drug dealers and other criminals will not be
removed. The housing authorities of Orlando, Florida, and Savannah,
Georgia, have taken major steps in this direction. In both cities,
police act as community organizers working closely with tenants.
Officers take children on field trips and to ball games, introducing
them to a world of non-criminal activities. As a result of this, drug
activity in projects of both cities, especially Savannah, has been
greatly reduced. ("Orlando, Savannah Report Success in Fighting Drug
Problem," Housing and Development Reporter, January 21, 1991, p. 790.)
<P>
     With the enactment last fall by Congress of the HOPE
(Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere) program, the
federal government now can play an important role in reducing public
housing crime. HOPE provides funding to tenant organizations to manage
or own their housing projects, and puts housing authorities in a
better position to eliminate public housing decay. When law-abiding
tenants have responsibilities in running their projects, they will be
apt to take action against the criminal element. HUD should further
streamline its eviction procedure for all states in response to
widespread tenant complaints. Because drug dealing is often a family
activity, the new procedure, where based on good evidence, should
allow for the eviction of the family.
<P>
     Misguided Defenders. The primary obstacles to ridding projects of
criminals, especially drug dealers, are the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU), and the federally-funded Legal Services Corporation, and
the backing these groups receive from their allies in Congress. These
organizations consistently have opposed eviction and other crime
prevention measures in public housing on the grounds that they violate
the civil rights of low-income persons. That most tenants in housing
projects are both poor and law-abiding, and that they plead for such
action, apparently is of little concern to these radical legal
organizations. Congress should consider eliminating support of the
Legal Services Corporation if it continues to use any money for
defending drug dealers. 
<P>
4) Hire quality private security guards. 
<P>
     When security guards work closely with residents and police, they
can be a valuable tool in reducing crime in low-income neighborhoods.
Between 1975 and 1988, the number of private security guards increased
from 400,000 to 1.4 million nationwide. By contrast, the number of
full-time public police officers rose from 400,000 to just 600,000
during this period. (Richard Neely, "Law and Order -- Do It Yourself,"
Washington Post, October 21, 1990.) 
<P>
     Private security guards normally are not as well-trained as
policemen, and usually carry no firearms. Yet they can be an effective
and comparatively inexpensive addition to police forces if both
cooperate and communicate closely. According to Richard Neely, Chief
Justice of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals and a recognized
crime expert, it costs far more to put a uniformed police officer than
a private guard on the street. (Ibid.) This is because guards are
hired to prevent crimes rather than investigate them. The average
police officer spends about two percent of his or her time actively
patrolling, with the bulk of time devoted to such activities as
responding to calls, doing paperwork, and testifying in court. Private
guards devote about 90 percent of their time to patrolling and crime
prevention.
<P>
     The use of private guards, paid and volunteer, has cut crime in
housing projects in the nation, particularly in Starrett City, a
moderate-income high-rise apartment development in New York City, and
in drug-infested Mayfair Mansions, a Washington, D.C. public housing
complex whose tenants for years had been calling upon the housing
authority to take action. 

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Local government and housing authorities can hire private
security guards from among residents of low-income neighborhoods and
housing projects themselves. Training such persons to be guards, who
work closely with police, would announce clearly that a neighborhood
will be thoroughly patrolled, even if not by police. It also would
provide primary or secondary employment for these residents. HUD
allows payment for such guards from federal Drug Elimination Act funds
and the public housing operating budget. 
<P>
5) Clean up neighborhoods. 
<P>
     The worse a neighborhood looks, the more crime it tends to
suffer. According to UCLA's Wilson and Harvard's Kelling, broken
glass, uncollected trash, abandoned cars, graffiti, vagrants, and
prostitutes proclaim to criminal and resident alike that a community
cares little about what happens in its streets. (James Q. Wilson and
George L. Kelling, "Broken Windows," Atlantic, March 1982, pp. 29-38;
see also Wilson and Kelling, "Making Neighborhoods Safe.") This is an
open invitation to criminals and helps drive away those who otherwise
might live or open businesses there. This is confirmed statistically
by recent research, especially by the Director of Northwestern
University's Program in Law and the Social Sciences, Wesley G. Skogan.
(Skogan, Disorder and Decline. See also Daniel Lewis and Greta Salem,
Fear of Crime: Incivility and the Production of a Social Problem (New
Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Books, 1986); D.J. Kenny, Crime, Fear,
and the New York City Subways (New York: Praeger, 1987).) 
<P>
     The reverse also is true. When residents take the simple step of
cleaning their neighborhood, it tells criminals that the residents
care about their community and thus are more likely to report criminal
behavior. Where conscientiously applied, a clean-up strategy cuts
crime. Example: The New Briarfield Apartments in Newport News,
Virginia, suffered a massive increase in crime during the mid-1980s,
terrorizing its low-income residents, and driving many away. Nearly
one-fourth of the apartments were being burglarized at least once a
year. In an attempt to take control of the neighborhood away from the
criminals, the police in 1984 began to work with other municipal
agencies and with tenants in launching a campaign to clean up trash,
fill potholes, haul away abandoned cars, and sweep the streets. The
result was a 35 percent decline in burglaries within three years.
(Wilson and Kelling, "Making Neighborhoods Safe," pp. 46-47.)

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Local governments should sponsor frequent community clean-up days
in high-crime neighborhoods. Working with resident organizations,
state and local governments can be more diligent about towing away
abandoned vehicles. New York City is now aggressively removing
graffiti from public buildings and subway cars and stations; other
cities with graffiti problems should follow New York's lead. Graffiti
vandals, especially gang members who typically use graffiti to mark
turf, should be dealt with harshly by the courts and sentenced to
perform community service in addition to serving a jail term.
<P>
     One obstacle to a clean-up program is the unwillingness of local
bureaucracies to encroach upon each others' territories. To avoid
this, separate inter-agency task forces should be created, with
employees from various agencies consulting with neighborhood residents
in developing strategies in their own agency's programs. (Ibid., p.
52.) 
<P>
     Additionally, local governments should privatize sanitation,
street cleaning, public housing management, and certain other
services. Through privatization, these services would be provided more
efficiently, and at lower cost. As a result, fewer "broken windows"
would be visible to the criminal.
<P>
6) Create physical barriers to crime. 
<P>
     An increasingly common technique of community policing is
limiting access to a neighborhood. In many cases, the police, with the
cooperation of resident leaders, erect barricades and guard posts at
street intersections. Well-known is the Los Angeles Police
Department's "Operation Cul-de-Sac." (See discussions of the program
in Eloise Salholz, "The 'Walled Cities' of L.A.," Newsweek, May 14,
1990, pp. 24-25; Meese and Carrico, "Taking Back the Streets," pp.
27-28.) When a crack cocaine epidemic hit the south Los Angeles
neighborhood of Newton in the late-1980s, gang members terrorized the
neighborhood. Of the 873 murders in Los Angeles in 1989, 100 were in
Newton. 
<P>
     Working with residents, police created a "Narcotics Enforcement
Area" in February 1990. Police limited access to the community by
constructing entry gates at street entrances and exits. They also
interrogated suspicious persons where there was a legal basis to do
so. As a psychological barrier, the police put up the sign, "OPEN TO
RESIDENTS ONLY" at each gate. The program enjoyed the strong support
of the residents, many of whom had been too terrified to leave their
homes after dusk. Within six weeks, violent crime in Newton had fallen
by 90 percent; attendance at the nearby 2,600-student Jefferson High
School had risen by 150 to 200 students a day; and residents
rededicated a park that previously had been controlled by gangs. Then
the barricades were removed -- and crime, including several drive-by
shootings -- returned. The police brought back the barricades. Los
Angeles police also instituted street barricade programs in the
Sepulveda area of the San Fernando Valley. Within months, crime had
been cut by about one-third. 

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     Through close links with community leaders, local governments can
adopt the tactics of Operation Cul-de-Sac to limit access to some
neighborhoods. This of course needs broad neighborhood support, lest
the operation harass and thus anger law-abiding persons living in,
visiting, or passing through these neighborhoods. Police departments,
with the help of neighborhood groups, should identify where the crime
problems are, and then cordon off the key intersections and provide
residents with opportunities to report suspicious-looking behavior. 
<P>
     One possibility is privatization of streets. St. Louis, for
example, since the 19th century has had America's most extensive
system of privately-owned and maintained residential streets. Though
originally seen as a way of avoiding the city's taxing and spending
limitations, one of its side effects has been crime prevention. (Oscar
Newman, Community of Interest, (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1981),
pp. 124-56.) 
<P>
7) Steer children away from crime. 
<P>
     The evidence shows that reaching troubled children during their
pre-adolescent years has the greatest effect on deterring them from
becoming adult criminals. (Wolfgang, Thornberry, and Figlio, From Boy
to Man.) Instilling values of respect for property, hard work, and
respect for the nuclear family reduces criminal behavior. By contrast,
children who become criminals often have suffered parental abuse or
neglect. (According to the director of a Boston-area settlement house,
the incidence of child abuse in underclass families -- black and white
-- is "nearly 100 percent." See Morton Kondracke, "The Two Black
Americas," New Republic, February 6, 1989, p. 19.) 
<P>
     Several police forces well understand the importance of
preventing crime by exposing children to its futility. "We absolutely
have to target the real young kids," states Philadelphia Police
Commissioner Willie Williams, adding that police and community leaders
must "completely educate them about drugs, sex and how to protect
themselves from family members leading them to drugs." (Quoted in Tom
Morganthau, "Children of the Underclass," Newsweek, September 11,
1989, p. 24.) The Los Angeles Police Department's sponsors several
youth intervention programs, such as the Jeopardy Program, in which
officers visit the parents of youth involved with gangs, and DARE
(Drug Abuse Resistance Education), in which officers come into school
classes, and lecture students about the dangers of drug abuse.
Similarly, New York City has launched a program, "Cops and Kids,"
aimed at keeping children in school, improving reading skills,
preventing drug addiction, and creating after-school jobs and sports
programs, among other activities. (Felicia R. Lee, "Havens for Youths
in Anti-Crime Plan," New York Times, October 11, 1990.) These police-
sponsored programs are models for other cities. 
<P>
     Community groups and private institutions have established
similar programs. In Washington, D.C.'s Kenilworth-Parkside Gardens, a
former public housing project now owned by its tenants, the managers
sponsor a program that teaches youths how to develop business skills
that will keep them out of trouble. Children also are employed in
project-sponsored businesses to bake, package, and sell cookies.
Working on commission, many youngsters earn up to $45 a day. (See
DiLulio, "The Impact of Inner-City Crime," p. 45.) Also, D.C. police
are sponsoring nighttime basketball games to get teenagers off the
streets during hours in which they might be tempted by crime, and
involve them in recreation that tests their strength and athletic
skills. Working with the D.C. local government, the National
Basketball Players' Association, Anheuser-Busch Companies,
Incorporated, and The Coca-Cola Company are acting as co-sponsors of
this "Late Night Hoops" program. (Ruben Castaneda, "'Hoops' Offers
Sanctuary from Streets," Washington Post, November 29, 1990.)

<P>
<B> What Government Can Do</B>
<P>
     The federal and state government should promote youth
intervention programs. One possibility would be to use Project Head
Start more frequently as a crime prevention program. Local police can
work with parents of assisted children to educate them on the dangers
of drugs.
<P>
     Public school drug education programs should shift some of their
emphasis away from students in high school and junior high schools and
toward those in elementary school, since most -- though not all --
children that age have not yet begun to use drugs and deal in them.
States and localities should establish educational tax credit voucher
programs that enable low-income parents to choose private schools that
provide a drug-free environment.
<P>

<B> CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
     Reducing crime is a key to neighborhood revitalization and
economic improvement. The evidence is clear that one of the best ways
of accomplishing this is by forging resident-police programs to
discourage crimes rather than simply using the police to investigate
crimes after they have happened. Only when residents feel they can
work closely with police will fear of crime subside. 
<P>
     The argument that crime is of secondary concern, and is a
byproduct of poverty, misunderstands the causal relationship between
poverty and crime. Tackling crime is the precondition to a successful
war on poverty -- tackling poverty is not the key to reducing crime.
<P>
     In tackling crime, public officials at all levels must adhere to
the following principles:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> A police anti-crime program in low-income neighborhoods requires
     maximum face-to-face communication with resident leaders.
<P>
     Crime prevention is less expensive and more effective than crime
     investigation.
<P>
     No neighborhood or housing project, no matter how seemingly
     hopeless, can be written off. Success stories can and have
     happened even in the most crime-ridden neighborhoods.
<P>
     Economic development strategies to help the poor will work best
     when linked to areas with local crime prevention programs.
<P>
     Neighborhood space should be perceived by resident and non-
     resident alike as being under control of the law-abiding, not the
     lawless. Removal of graffiti, abandoned housing, litter, and
     other evidence of decay must have a high priority in municipal
     budgets.
<P>
     The drug culture must be eliminated. This means above all
     educating children and adolescents about the destructive and
     self-defeating nature of the drug world, and giving landlords and
     housing authorities the right to evict drug dealers with a
     minimum of impedence from misguided "civil rights" groups.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     New Relationships. To rid poor urban neighborhoods of their
criminal element, public officials at all levels must encourage the
creation of new relationships between low-income resident
organizations and local police forces. Central to this strategy is to
give residents the confidence that they can take steps themselves to
reduce crime. In this way, America may one day have a real chance of
declaring victory in a war on urban poverty.
