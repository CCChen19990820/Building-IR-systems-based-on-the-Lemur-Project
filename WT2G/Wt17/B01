USE TO POPULAR CULTURE</h2>

<p>
Adults and adolescents see popular culture as a major factor in
the recent increase of drug abuse, according to Columbia University
researchers.
<P>
The Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia
released a national survey on June 29, 1995 showing that 76 percent
of adolescents and 67 percent of adults blame popular culture
-- television, movies, magazines, and popular music -- for encouraging
illegal drug use.[1]
<P>
&quot;What's at stake here is America's children,&quot; says CASA
President and former HEW Secretary Joseph A. Califano, Jr.  &quot;We
know that individuals who make it from age 10 to age 20 without
using illegal drugs, without abusing alcohol, without smoking,
are virtually certain never to do so.&quot;
<P>
The Luntz Research Company, which surveyed 2,400 adults and adolescents
between May 18 and June 8, 1995, asked, &quot;What is the most
important problem facing kids today?&quot;  One-third of the adolescents
answered &quot;drugs.&quot;  A distant second with 13 percent
was &quot;crime and violence in school,&quot; which often also
involves drugs.
<P>
The poll also included the question, &quot;When do kids start
using drugs?&quot;  Nine out of ten people who use drugs begin
by age 17.  A surprising one-third begin by age 13.

THE MYTHS AND THE FACTS</H2>

<P>
Despite data which strongly supports the continuation of effective
drug abuse prevention, treatment and enforcement programs, some
prominent Americans support legalizing illicit drugs.  For example:
<P>
<LI>George Shultz, former President Reagan's Secretary of State,
says that &quot;Legalization would destroy dealer profits and
remove their incentive to get young people addicted.&quot;[1]
<P>
<LI>Nobel laureate in economics Milton Friedman says that the criminalization
of certain drugs undermines respect for the law and creates &quot;a
decadent moral climate.&quot;  He states that legalizing drugs
like marijuana and cocaine would &quot;thus strike a double blow;
reduce crime activity directly, and at the same time increase
the efficacy of law enforcement and crime prevention.&quot;[2]
<P>
<LI>U.S. Federal District Judge Robert Sweet says the nation should
learn the lesson of prohibition and the crime that ensued when
alcohol was illegal.  &quot;Look at tobacco, the most addictive
drug, and we've reduced [use] by a third.&quot;[3]
<P>
<LI>Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke commented on former Surgeon General
Joycelyn Elders' call for a study to legalize drugs.  &quot;I
think what the Surgeon General said was absolutely courageous
and correct.&quot;[4]
<P>
<LI>Aryeh Neier, president of billionaire philanthropist George
Soros's Open Society Institute, states, &quot;The current [drug]
policy is wasteful and it promotes crime and disease....  From
every standpoint, it is a failure.&quot;[5]
<P>
Many other officials disagree.
<P>
Lee P. Brown, the director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy at the White House, labels legalization &quot;a formula
for self-destruction&quot;[6] and warns that decriminalization of
drugs would mean genocide for the black community.[7]
<P>
Wayne Roques, a much-published Drug Enforcement Agency spokesman,
says, &quot;Drug policies which legalize drugs would decimate
the inner cities and gravely wound the suburban populations....
 Legalization is a morally and intellectually bankrupt concept.&quot;[8]
<P>
Most Americans want to know the truth about drugs and expect public
policy to be based on facts and not myths.  Yet myths about legalization
abound.  Consider:
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #1: ILLICIT DRUGS ARE NO WORSE THAN LEGAL<BR>
DRUGS LIKE ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Marianne Apostolides of the pro-legalization Lindesmith Center
wrote in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, &quot;Marijuana is safer
than other substances such as nicotine and steroids.  Most people
who use marijuana have no problem with it.&quot;[9]
<P>
Yale law professor Steven B. Duke, who wrote <I>America's Longest
War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade Against Drugs</I>, believes,
&quot;Our biggest, worst drug problem is the tobacco problem.
 Legalizing drugs will reduce the use of alcohol, which is far
more damaging than any popular illegal drug.&quot;[10]
<P>
The fact that some dangerous substances are legal does not mean
that all dangerous substances should also be legal -- especially
when there are significant differences between the substances
in question.  Clearly, alcohol and tobacco can be quite harmful.
 They have a major impact on morbidity and mortality in the United
States.  
<P>
<LI>Alcohol is a cause or contributing factor in most traffic deaths
and nearly half of all murders, sexual assaults, robberies and
other violent crimes.  More than 40,000 babies are born at risk
each year because their mothers drank alcohol during pregnancy.[11]
<P>
<LI>Similarly, tobacco kills over 400,000 people each year in the
United States, and the British medical journal, <I>Lancet</I>,
estimates that tobacco is the cause of death for 20 percent of
the people in the developed world.[12]
<P>
<LI>Nevertheless, a given dose of cocaine or crack is far more dangerous
than a drink of alcohol.  Alcohol has an addiction rate of 10
percent, whereas cocaine has an addiction rate as high as 75 percent.[13]
<P>
And when cocaine is combined with marijuana, it can be deadly.
 According to a study in <I>Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior,</I>
an increase in heart rate due to cocaine was markedly enhanced
if preceded by smoking marijuana.[14] The dual use creates greater
risk of overdose and more severe cardiovascular effects from the
cocaine.  An article in <I>Schizophrenia Research</I> found that
up to 60 percent of schizophrenic patients used non-prescription
psychoactive drugs.[15]
<P>
By itself, marijuana is a dangerous drug as well.  A joint of
marijuana is far more carcinogenic than a cigarette.  Microbiologist
Tom Klein of the University of South Florida reports, &quot;We've
tried working with [marijuana smoke], and it's so toxic, you just
get it near the immune system and it [the immune system] dies.&quot;
 Klein found that THC [tetrahydrocannabinol -- the active ingredient
in marijuana] suppresses some immune system responses and enhances
others.[16]
<P>
A study in the <I>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology</I>
found that marijuana smoke is often contaminated by the fungus,
aspergillus.[17]  Another study in the <I>Journal of the American
Medical Association</I> found that cases of allergic sinus infection
with the same fungus came from recreational use of contaminated
marijuana.[18]
<P>
A study in <I>Drug and Alcohol Dependence</I> found that cannabis
[marijuana] users react very slowly in performing motor tasks
and suffer disability in personal, social and vocational areas.
 They also indicate a higher score for neurotic and psychotic
behavior.[19]
<P>
A study in <I>American Review of Respiratory Diseases</I> found
that marijuana smoke is as irritating as tobacco smoke; when used
together, marijuana and tobacco cause the small oxygen-exchanging
parts of the lung to shed cells that first become inflamed.[20]
<P>
A 1995 study in <I>The New England Journal of Medicine</I> suggests
that illicit drugs such as marijuana and cocaine can interfere
with male sperm production.[21] 
<P>
A study in <I>Cancer</I> found that the children of women who
smoke marijuana are 11 times more likely to contract leukemia.[22]
 Mothers who smoke marijuana also contribute to low birth weight
and developmental problems for their children and increase the
risk of abnormalities similar to those caused by fetal alcohol
syndrome by as much as 500 percent.[23]
<P>
Kasi Sridhar, a professor at the University of Miami's Sylvester
Comprehensive Cancer Research Center, reports finding large numbers
of marijuana smokers among younger cancer patients.  While only
17 percent of the patients in his study were marijuana smokers,
two-thirds of the patients younger than 45 smoked cannabis.[24]
<P>
Since the 1970s there have been more than 10,500 scientific studies
which demonstrate the adverse consequences of marijuana use.[25]
Many of these studies draw upon data collected when most of the
marijuana available in the U.S. was far less potent than that
available today.  Indeed, drug czar Lee Brown says that marijuana
on the streets today is up to 10 times more potent than a generation
ago.  This fact contributes to its addictive nature.[26]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #2: LEGALIZATION WILL DRIVE THE CRIME RATE DOWN.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Syndicated columnist Abigail Van Buren endorses <I>Legalization</I>.
 She wrote in her column, &quot;Dear Abby,&quot; that, &quot;The
legalization of drugs would put drug dealers out of business.&quot;
She added that it would also reduce the prison population and
create a perpetual source of tax revenue.[27]
<P>
Former Surgeon General Elders told a National Press Club luncheon,
&quot;Sixty percent of violent crimes are drug- or alcohol-related....
 Many times they're robbing, stealing and all of these things
to get money to buy drugs....  I do feel that we would markedly
reduce our crime rate if drugs were legalized.&quot;[28]
<P>
Professor Steven Duke told an America Online computer network
audience, &quot;Without a doubt, the problem of violent crime
would be ameliorated [by legalizing drugs].  I think drug prohibition
causes half of our serious crime.&quot;[29]
<P>
Rep. Barney Frank (D-Ma.) supports legalization.  &quot;We make
a mistake, with the serious law enforcement problems we have today,
to get the police to arrest people who smoke marijuana....  We
are wasting $10 billion a year trying to physically interdict
drugs.&quot;[30]
<P>
The new president of the American Bar Association, George Bushnell,
favors legalizing marijuana and cocaine.  He believes legalization
will cut crime.[31]
<P>
Legalizers believe most black market and organized syndicate involvement
in the drug business would die and that drug-induced crime would
decrease with drug legalization.  But these assertions are not
supported by the facts.
<P>
The United States experimented with legalization and it failed.
 From 1919 to 1922, government-sponsored clinics handed out free
drugs to addicts in hopes of controlling their behavior.  The
effort failed.  Society's revulsion against drugs, combined with
enforcement,  successfully eradicated the menace at that time.[32]
<P>
California decriminalized marijuana in 1976, and, within the first
six months, arrests for driving under the influence of drugs rose
46 percent for adults and 71.4 percent for juveniles.[33] Decriminalizing
marijuana in Alaska and Oregon in the 1970s resulted in the doubling
of use.[34]
<P>
Patrick Murphy, a court-appointed lawyer for 31,000 abused and
neglected children in Chicago, says that more than 80 percent
of the cases of physical and sexual abuse of children now involve
drugs.  There is no evidence that legalizing drugs will reduce
these crimes, and there is evidence that suggests it would worsen
the problem.[35]
<P>
Legalization would decrease drug distribution crime because most
of those activities would become lawful.  But would legalization
necessarily reduce other drug-related crime like robbery, rape,
and assault?  Presumably legalization would reduce the cost of
drugs and thus addicts might commit fewer crimes to pay for their
habits.  But less expensive drugs might also feed their habit
better, and more drugs means more side effects like paranoia,
irritability and violence.  Suggestions that crime can somehow
be eliminated by redefining it are spurious.
<P>
Free drugs or legalizing bad drugs would not make criminal addicts
into productive citizens.  Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, expert on
drugs and adolescents and president of Phoenix House, a resident
treatment center in New York, said, &quot;If you give somebody
free drugs you don't turn him into a responsible employee, husband,
or father.&quot;[36]
<P>
The Justice Department reports that most inmates (77.4 percent
male and 83.6 percent female) have a drug history and the majority
were under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of their
current offense.  And a surprisingly large number of convicted
felons admit their crime motive was to get money for drugs.  For
example, 12 percent of all violent offenses and 24.4 percent of
all property offenses were drug-money motivated.[37]
<P>
Even if drugs were legalized some restrictions still would be
necessary.  For example, restricting the sale of legalized drugs
to minors, pregnant women, police, military, pilots and prisoners
would be necessary but would still provide a black market niche.
<P>
Pro-legalizers contend that government could tax drugs, thus off-setting
the social costs of abuse.  But history proves that efforts to
tax imported drugs like opium created a black market.  Earlier
this century Chinese syndicates smuggled legal opium into this
country to avoid tariffs.  Even today, there is ample crime based
on the legal drugs, alcohol, and tobacco.  For example, organized
crime smuggles cigarettes from states with low tobacco taxes into
those with high taxes, and such activities are accompanied by
violence against legal suppliers.[38]
<P>
If now-illegal drugs were decriminalized, the government would
have to determine the allowable potency for commercial drugs.
 But no government can okay toxic substances, so a black market
would be created for higher potency drugs and those that remained
banned, like the new &quot;designer drugs.&quot;
<P>
Even pro-drug forces do not call for blanket legalization of drugs
like LSD, crack, or PCP.  Therefore, we would continue to have
drug-related crime and illegal drug distribution organizations
that would push these drugs on youngsters, who would be more easily
induced into drug abuse through the availability and social sanctioning
of marijuana.
<P>
Drug abuse is closely correlated with crime.  The National Youth
Survey found that 25 percent of youths who admitted to cocaine
or heroin use also committed 40 percent of all the index crimes
reported.  The survey also found that youths who tested positive
for cannabinoids have more than twice as many non-drug-related
felony referrals to juvenile court as compared with those found
to have tested negative.[39]
<P>
The extent to which individuals commit &quot;drug-related crimes
only&quot; is overstated.  Most incarcerated &quot;drug&quot;
offenders violated other laws as well.  Princeton University professor
John Dilulio found that only 2 percent -- i.e., 700 -- of those
in federal prisons were convicted of pure drug possession.  They
generally committed other and violent crimes to earn a sentence.[40]
 However, 70 percent of current inmates were on illegal drugs
when arrested and, if drugs become cheaper, violent crime could
reasonably be expected to increase.[41]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #3: LEGALIZATION MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke believes drugs can be a revenue source
for the government.  &quot;Remove the profit motive, and you put
the dealers out of business... have government stores and buy
marijuana cigarettes... nicely wrapped, purity and potency guaranteed
with a tax stamp.&quot;[42]
<P>
Ethan Nadelmann, a former Princeton University professor and now
director of the Lindesmith Center, states: &quot;Make sure that
junkies have access to clean needles; make it easy for addicts
to obtain methadone; give heroin-maintenance programs a chance
to work; decriminalize marijuana; stop spending billions on incarcerating
drug users and drug dealers.  We know we can reduce drug abuse
more effectively by spending that money on education, pre- and
post-natal care and job-training programs.&quot;[43]
<P>
Nadelmann told the <I>Rolling Stone</I> audience, &quot;...The
Pentagon's interdiction efforts, which cost U.S. taxpayers close
to $1 billion... had no impact on the flow of drugs....  [The]
drug war has been most efficient at filling up the country's prisons
and jails.&quot;[44]
<P>
Dr. Robert Dupont, founding director of the National Institute
on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and president of the Institute for Behavior
and Health in Rockville, Maryland, refutes the economic myth.
 &quot;We now have two legal drugs, alcohol and tobacco.  We have
113 million current users of alcohol and 60 million tobacco users.
 The reason marijuana and cocaine use is so much lower is because
they are illegal drugs.  Cocaine and marijuana are more attractive
than alcohol and tobacco.  If we remove the prohibition of illegality
we would have a number of users of marijuana and cocaine similar
to that of tobacco and alcohol.&quot;[45]
<P>
Health costs associated with legalization would be very high.
 And legalization would have consequences elsewhere.  For example,
the Drug Enforcement Administration says legalization of drugs
will cost society between $140-210 billion a year in lost productivity
and job-related accidents.  And insurance companies would pass
on accident expenses to consumers.[46]   
<P>
The Institute for Health Policy at Brandeis University found that
in 1990 dollars the societal cost of substance abuse is in excess
of $238 billion, of which $67 billion is for illicit drugs.  The
report states, &quot;As the number one health problem in the country,
substance abuse places a major burden on the nation's health care
system and contributes to the high cost of health care.  In fact,
substance abuse -- the problematic use of alcohol, illicit drugs
and tobacco -- places an enormous burden on American society as
a whole.&quot;[47]
<P>
The claim that legalization provides an opportunity to tax new
products is misleading.  For example, total tax revenue from the
sale of alcohol is $13.1 billion a year, but alcohol extracts
over $100 billion a year in social costs such as health care and
lost productivity.[48] There is no evidence to demonstrate that taxing
cocaine, heroin, and marijuana would bolster revenues any more
than do alcohol and tobacco, nor would the revenue from such taxation
offset the social and medical costs these illicit drugs would
impose.
<P>
The pro-drug lobby argues that legalization will save on enforcement
costs.  But elimination of drug enforcement would provide little
funding for other uses.  The government now spends 3.3 percent
of its budget on the criminal justice system and half of that
goes to enforcement.  Less than 12 percent of law enforcement
money goes to drug law enforcement.[49] 
<P>
Former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Joseph Califano
cautions that in a post-legalization world, &quot;Madison Avenue
hucksters would make it as attractive to do a few lines [of cocaine]
as to down a few beers.&quot;[50] This would line the pockets of
legal drug producers, but it will clearly hurt the American taxpayer
and American families.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #4: CRIMINALIZATION OF DRUGS IS LIKE ALCOHOL PROHIBITION.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Conservative columnist William F. Buckley, Jr., writes that the
&quot;...New York Bar in 1986 advocated the repeal of all federal
legislation dealing with drugs, leaving it to the states to write
their own policies.  This will remind you of the 21st Amendment:
when prohibition was repealed in 1933, each state was left free
to write its own liquor laws.&quot;[51]
<P>
Lindesmith Institute director Nadelmann argues that &quot;Prohibition...
financed the rise of organized crime and failed miserably as social
policy.  Likewise, the war on drugs has created new, well-financed,
and violent criminal conspiracies and failed to achieve any of
its goals.&quot;[52]
<P>
Prohibition was a solitary effort by this country while the rest
of the world was essentially &quot;wet.&quot;  However, most drugs
are illegal throughout much of the world.  This makes enforcement
much easier.
<P>
History shows that prohibition curbed alcohol abuse.  Alcohol
use declined by 30 to 50 percent; deaths from cirrhosis of the
liver fell from 29.5 per 100,000 in 1911 to 10.7 in 1929; and
admissions to state mental hospitals for alcohol psychosis fell
from 10.1 per 100,000 in 1919 to 4.7 in 1928.[53] Mark Moore, Harvard
professor of criminal justice, wrote: &quot;The real lesson of
prohibition is that society can, indeed, make a dent in the consumption
of drugs through laws.&quot;[54]
<P>
The DEA found that during prohibition, suicide rates decreased
50 percent.  The incidence of alcohol-related arrests also declined
50 percent.[55]
<P>
Yale history professor David F. Musto comments on the myth that
prohibition is a good parallel for illicit drug legalization:
&quot;Unless drugs were legal for everyone, including children...
illicit sale of drugs would continue.  Legalization would create
more drug-addicted babies, not to mention drug-impaired drivers.&quot;[56]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #5: OTHER NATIONS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY LEGALIZED DRUGS.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Mr. Nadelmann points to foreign nations when he writes, &quot;We
can learn much from Europe and Australia, where governments have
turned their backs on the 'war on drugs.'  They began by accepting
the obvious:  that it is both futile and dangerous to try to create
a drug-free society.&quot;[57]
<P>
Dr. John Marks of Liverpool, England promotes Great Britain's
&quot;enlightened&quot; drug programs.  &quot;The results are
zero drug-related deaths, zero HIV infection among injecting drug
takers, a... reduction of... 96 percent [in] acquisitive crime.
 And perhaps most puzzling of all, a fall in the incidence of
addiction, among the public at large of... 92 percent.&quot;[58]
<P>
History provides evidence that legalization of drugs in foreign
nations has not been successful.  For example, opium was legalized
in China earlier this century.  That decision resulted in 90 million
addicts and it took a half-century to repair the damage.[59]
<P>
Egypt allowed unrestricted trade of cocaine and heroin in the
1920s.  An epidemic of addiction resulted.  Even in Iran and Thailand,
countries where drugs are readily available, the prevalence of
addiction continues to soar.[60]
<P>
Modern-day Netherlands is often cited as a country which has successfully
legalized drugs.  Marijuana is sold over the counter and police
seldom arrest cocaine and heroin users.  But official tolerance
has led to significant increases in addiction.  
<P>
Amsterdam's officials blame the significant rise in crime on the
liberal drug policy.  The city's 7,000 addicts are blamed for
80 percent of all property crime and Amsterdam's rate of burglary
is now twice that of Newark, New Jersey.[61] Drug problems have forced
the city to increase the size of the police force and the city
fathers are now rethinking the drug policy.[62]
<P>
Dr. K. F. Gunning, president of the Dutch National Committee on
Drug Prevention, cites some revealing statistics about drug abuse
and crime.  Cannabis use among students increased 250 percent
from 1984 to 1992.  During the same period, shootings rose 40
percent, car thefts increased 62 percent, and hold-ups rose 69
percent.[63]
<P>
Sweden legalized doctor prescriptions of amphetamines in 1965.
 During the first year of legalization, the number of intravenous
&quot;speed&quot; addicts rose 88.5 percent.  A study of men arrested
during the legalization period showed a high correlation between
intravenous use and a variety of crimes.[64]
<P>
Dr. Nils Bejorot, director of the Swedish Carnegie Institute and
professor of social medicine at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm,
believes the solution to the growing drug problem is consistent
social and legal harassment of both users and dealers.[65]
<P>
Great Britain experimented with controlled distribution of heroin
between 1959 and 1968.  According to the <I>British Medical Journal</I>,
the number of heroin addicts doubled every sixteen months and
the increase in addicts was accompanied by an increase in criminal
activity as well.[66] And British authorities found that heroin addicts
have a very good chance of dying prematurely.  On the crime front,
Scotland Yard had to increase its narcotics squad 100 percent
to combat the crime caused by the &quot;legal&quot; addicts.[67]
<P>
The Swiss opened a &quot;legalized drug&quot; area in Zurich seven
years ago and local addicts were given drugs, clean needles, and
emergency medical care.  Unfortunately, the liberal policy backfired
and the number of addicts surged to 3,500; violence surged, too.
 &quot;Needle Park,&quot; as it came to be known, was a place
of open warfare among rival gangs, and even police faced gunfire.
Their cars were attacked and overturned.  In February 1995, officials
ended the experiment, conceding that it had evolved into a grotesque
spectacle.[68]
<P>
In April 1994, the mayors of 21 major European cities formed a
group called &quot;European Cities Against Drugs,&quot; an acknowledgement
that legalization had failed.[69]
<P>
There are some countries, especially in the Middle East, which
extract a high price for drug trafficking.  These countries enjoy
relative freedom from the plague of drug abuse and crime associated
with illicit sales.  This is never mentioned by <I>Legalization</I> proponents.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #6: LEGALIZATION WOULD LEAD TO HEALTH BENEFITS.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Nadelmann states, &quot;We should immediately decriminalize the
sale and possession of small amounts of marijuana and make it
easily available by prescription to those suffering from cancer,
AIDS, multiple sclerosis and other diseases.&quot;[70] He tells <I>Rolling
Stone</I> readers, &quot;DEA's own administrative law judge Francis
Young declared in 1988, marijuana is possibly Uone of the safest
therapeutically active substances known to man.&quot;[71]
<P>
Arnold S. Trebach, former president of the Drug Policy Foundation,
calls for the medical use of certain illegal drugs.  He claims
there is &quot;no scientific or ethical reason why government
denies heroin and marijuana to people suffering from cancer, glaucoma,
multiple sclerosis, and other diseases.&quot;[72]
<P>
In January 1994 the Clinton Administration decided to review the
federal ban against the use of marijuana for medical purposes.
 Allen St. Pierre, deputy director of the National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), commented on the review
decision: &quot;It's encouraging to see that the public health
service is going to get information about the efficacy of marijuana
as a therapeutic agent....  If marijuana can never be made available
to people suffering pain or going blind, it's never going to be
legalized more generally.&quot;[73]
<P>
Legalization advocates cite cases like that of James Burton, who
has glaucoma.  Drug agents seized his home for growing marijuana,
and he now lives in the Netherlands where &quot;I can buy or grow
marijuana here legally, and if I don't have the marijuana, I'll
go blind.&quot;[74]
<P>
Burton has a rare form of low-tension glaucoma.  At Burton's trial,
ophthalmologist Dr. John Merritt testified that Burton needed
marijuana to keep him from going blind.[75] 
<P>
Others claim that marijuana can be used to treat the side-effects
of chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting and the &quot;wasting&quot;
phenomenon associated with AIDS.
<P>
There is substantial and contradictory evidence indicating that
illicit drugs should not be legalized for medical purposes.  Most
advocates for medical use of illicit drugs only address marijuana.
 Consider the evidence:
<P>
<LI>Philip Lee, Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services,
announced in July 1994, &quot;The scientific evidence doesn't
support using marijuana to treat glaucoma or nausea caused by
AIDS or cancer treatment.&quot;  Harvard medical school professor
Lester Grinspoon has challenged Lee's decision.  Grinspoon said
there is only anecdotal evidence that marijuana smoking is beneficial
because &quot;the government has prevented the scientific studies
for years.&quot;[76]
<P>
<LI>The DEA reports that marijuana is not accepted as medicine by
a single American health association.[77]
<P>
<LI>Dr. David Ettinger, professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine, states, &quot;There is no indication
that marijuana is effective in treating nausea and vomiting resulting
from radiation treatment or other causes.&quot;[78]
<P>
<LI>A research review published in the <I>Annals of Pharmacotherapy</I>
found no scientific studies that confirmed the benefit of the
use of crude marijuana on HIV-wasting syndrome.  The use of marijuana
might actually be counter-productive because it poses a needless
and serious endangerment to the already compromised immune systems
of AIDS patients.[79]
<P>
<LI>Two studies in a 1991 book entitled <I>Drugs of Abuse: Immunity
and Immunodeficiency</I> found that the active ingredient in marijuana,
THC, suppresses or interferes with the function of white blood
cells, which fight bacterial infection.[80] Any reduction in the
fighting power of white blood cells could accelerate an HIV-positive
patient's transition to AIDS.  Additionally, marijuana increases
the health risk to AIDS patients because the smoke causes pulmonary
problems.
<P>
<LI>Glaucoma studies found that THC can decrease intraocular pressure.
 However, in order to ingest sufficient THC, the patient would
have to be stoned all day.  Alcohol also decreases intraocular
pressure.  According to Dr. Keith Green, who has served on the
boards of eight eye journals, &quot;Marijuana... has little potential
future as a glaucoma medication.&quot;[81]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #7: LEGALIZE TO REDUCE ADDICTION RATES.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Mayor Schmoke told the 1993 Drug Policy Foundation conference,
&quot;The United States' war on drugs and similar campaigns in
other countries have failed.  Only a harm reduction policy, led
by public health experts and emphasizing treatment, can be expected
to reduce addiction.&quot;[82]
<P>
Previous efforts to legalize drugs like marijuana saw an increase
in abuse.  The National Families in Action found that during the
decade when 11 states decriminalized marijuana, regular use tripled
among adolescents, doubled among young adults, and quadrupled
among older adults.[83] 
<P>
Today, there are more than 8,000 emergency room visits for marijuana
abuse each year, and 77,000 persons each year are admitted to
treatment programs for marijuana abuse.[84]
<P>
It is alleged that the problem may be worse today because marijuana
is more addictive.  The pro-legalization Lindesmith Institute
challenged this in a recent <I>Wall Street Journal</I> letter.
 &quot;The myth that marijuana is three times as potent [and therefore
more addictive] as it was in the 1970s is based on a statistically
invalid comparison.  The potency of today's marijuana is measured
by a large and diverse number of confiscated marijuana samples.
 The potency of 1970s marijuana was measured by a small and unrepresentative
number of DEA-seized samples.&quot;[85]
<P>
But the DEA cites tests of THC content.  For example, the marijuana
seized at Woodstock '69 had 1 percent THC; in 1974 the average
THC was 3.6 percent; in 1984 it was 4.4 percent; and samples analyzed
in 1992 were 29.86 percent.  Based on these findings, DEA claims
that marijuana may be between 30 and 60 times as potent as were
the joints in the 1960s.[86]
<P>
ONDCP director Lee Brown confirms the addictive nature of marijuana.
 &quot;The public may have grown more blasJ about marijuana over
the years; the marijuana on the streets today is up to 10 times
more potent than that available to teenagers a generation ago.&quot;[87]
<P>
Cocaine is, of course, more addictive than marijuana.  President
William Howard Taft identified cocaine as &quot;[M]ore appalling
in its effects than any other habit-forming drug in the United
States.&quot;  He wanted it banned back in 1910.  And the ranks
of cocaine addicts grew before the substance was outlawed in 1915.[88]
<P>
During the late 1960s, Dr. Marie Nyswander experimented with opiate
addicts at the Rockefeller University, giving them free morphine,
and saw the addicts' daily tolerance for morphine rise swiftly.
 Her partner, Dr. Vincent Dole, commented, &quot;The doses on
which you could keep them comfortable kept going up and up; the
addicts were never really satisfied or happy.  It was not an encouraging
experience.&quot;[89]
<P>
Nyswander noted, &quot;Most drug abusers simply want to get high.
 Because the body daily develops more tolerance for abused drugs,
addicts must use escalating dosages to achieve euphoria.&quot;[90]
<P>
The DEA says that up to 75 percent of crack cocaine users could
become addicts.  And Mitchell Rosenthal believes that cheap and
legal cocaine would increase addiction.  He explains that &quot;given
unlimited access to cocaine, lab animals will consume increasingly
greater amounts until they die....  [He points out that] in the
U.S. there are between 650,000 and 2.4 million cocaine addicts.&quot;[91]
<P>
Dr. Mark Gold, formerly the research director at Fair Oaks Hospital
in Summit, New Jersey, now a professor at the University of Florida
medical school and a recognized expert on cocaine, states, &quot;Whereas
one out of ten alcohol users become alcoholics, one out of four
users of cocaine become addicted.  If, for example, cocaine becomes
legalized and use rose from 6 million to 60 million, this would
mean we would have 15 million addicts in need of treatment, without
prospects for a complete cure, constantly relapsing.&quot;[92]
<P>
Dr. Herbert Kleber of Columbia University suggests that legalizing
cocaine would increase use up to sixfold.  And Joseph A. Califano,
founding president of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse
at Columbia University, notes that any &quot;stamp of legality&quot;
on cocaine would lead to big increases in the number of addicts
and &quot;light a new flame beneath health care spending.&quot;[93]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MYTH #8: LEGALIZATION IS A CIVIL LIBERTIES ISSUE.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
NORML's Allen St. Pierre states, &quot;If you took the illegality
out, pot wouldn't mean anything to rappers....  [B]ut it's an
injustice they can sing about.&quot;[94]
<P>
Chicago commodities trader Richard Dennis has contributed more
than $1 million to the pro-legalization Drug Policy Foundation.
 He opposes criminal penalties for drug use and states, &quot;It's
a self-evident proposition that people shouldn't go to jail for
things they do to themselves.&quot;[95]
<P>
To legalize behavior is in large measure to condone it.  DEA agent
Wayne Roques visits many high schools in Florida to discuss illicit
drugs.  At every session at least one student defends use of illicit
drugs explaining, &quot;Surgeon General Elders supports legalization.
 So drugs must be okay.&quot;[96]
<P>
Illicit drug use is not a victimless crime because the user, his
family, and society suffer social and economic costs.  For example,
drug use by pregnant mothers causes in utero damage to the child.
 It increases the risk of mortality threefold and the risk of
low birthweight fourfold.  Drug abuse is a key factor in most
child abuse cases.  In Philadelphia, cocaine is implicated in
half of the cases in which parents beat their children to death,
and in 80 percent of all abuse cases.[97]
<P>
In the nation's capital, 90 percent of reported child abusers
are also illicit drug abusers.  In nearby Maryland, one-third
of all car accidents involve drivers who test positive for marijuana.
 And a few years ago, a Conrail disaster took the lives of 16
and hurt another 175, because the train conductors were intoxicated
with illegal drugs.[98] If those drugs were legal, the result would
have been no less lethal to the innocent victims.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
There is no &quot;civil right&quot; to do what is wrong or harmful
to yourself, your family, or your society.  
<P>
The facts show that legalization is a mistake for America because:
<P>
<LI>Illegal drugs are more addictive and dangerous than the legal
drugs alcohol and tobacco, which is verified by thousands of scientific
studies.  
<P>
<LI>Legalization would result in more crime such as driving while
intoxicated; child abuse, including child pornography; random
violent crime; and a prosperous black market.
<P>
<LI>Legalization has no economic justification.  Taxing illicit
drugs would offset only a small fraction of the social costs.
<P>
<LI>Banning illicit drugs is not like alcohol &quot;Prohibition.&quot;
 Drug laws reduce abuse and the medical costs associated with
abuse.  Legalization would do the opposite.
<P>
<LI>Other nations have learned that liberalizing drug policies only
leads to more addicts and unacceptable social consequences.  
<P>
<LI>Illicit drugs offer no offsetting health benefits.  Rather,
marijuana damages most major body systems and provides minimal
help for glaucoma victims and only when they are constantly stoned.
<P>
<LI>Cocaine is far more addictive than alcohol, and marijuana is
at least 10 times more potent today than a generation ago.

Drug abuse among teenagers has risen significantly in recent years.
 A nationwide survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
in 1994 found that annual marijuana use among 8th graders rose
from 6.2 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  The trend is
also evident among 10th (16.5 percent to 30.4 percent) and 12th
(36.7 percent to 38.2 percent) graders.  And cocaine, crack, heroin,
and LSD use among teenagers is also rising and may soon rival
the high rates of the 1970s.[1]
<P>
The NIDA found that drug-related emergency room cases increased
eight percent from 1992 to 1993.[2] Cocaine-related hospital emergency
room visits grew from 101,200 in 1991 to 119,800 in 1992; during
the same period, heroin-related emergencies soared from 35,900
to 48,000.[3]
<P>
In one study of reckless drivers who were not obviously drunk
from alcohol, 59 percent tested positive for cocaine or marijuana[4]
and thirty-five percent of all automobile accident victims in
another study had detectable levels of marijuana in their blood.[5]
<P>
The biggest rise is in marijuana abuse, possibly because it is
perceived differently from the &quot;hard&quot; drugs.  Although
some young people don't even consider marijuana a &quot;drug,&quot;
Dr. Carlton Turner, former NIDA director and head of the Marijuana
Research Project at the University of Mississippi, warns, &quot;There
is no other drug used or abused by man that has the staying power
and broad cellular actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana]
does.&quot;[6]
<P>
The short-term effects of marijuana include impairment in learning
and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills.  It
can cause difficulty in speaking, listening effectively, thinking,
retaining knowledge, problem-solving, and forming concepts.[7]
<P>
These effects can translate into poor job performance.  An article
in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I> found
that marijuana users had &quot;55 percent more industrial accidents,
85 percent more injuries and a 78 percent increase in absenteeism.&quot;[8]
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala states, &quot;Young
people 
must understand that there is clear scientific evidence that marijuana
is a dangerous drug that can have acute and hazardous effects.&quot;[9]
 Over 10,500 published scientific papers show that marijuana damages
brain cells, the lungs, may adversely affect reproduction in women
and fertility in men, endangers the unborn baby and newborns of
pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.[10] 
<P>
Shalala calls for &quot;strong and comprehensive solutions....Young
people must grow up knowing unambiguously that drug use -- including
smoking marijuana -- is unwise, unhealthful, illegal and wrong.
 They must hear this from everyone in their communities -- their
parents, their teachers, their employers, their peers, the media
-- all of us.  We need anti-drug messages that are every bit as
pervasive and strong as the pop culture images that tell our youth
drugs are o.k.&quot;[11]
<P>
Dr. Lloyd Johnson, lead researcher for NIDA's 20th annual survey,
says the aggressive anti-drug messages of the 1980s have receded
into the background.  &quot;If the softening of attitudes...continues
unabated, we can expect to see continued increases in drug use
among our children.&quot;[12] 
<P>
Dr. Johnson blames the culture.  &quot;The arduously woven fabric
of attitudes, beliefs and peer norms which brought about that
decline (in the 1980s) is beginning to unravel....  Conversely,
we're seeing drug abuse, and specifically marijuana use, talked
about positively in rock and rap music, in television programming
and in other areas like fashion.&quot;[13]
<P>
The consequences of unabated illicit drug use go beyond those
already outlined.  For example, illicit drug use correlates with
crime.  The Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 32 percent
of inmates have used cocaine and half had used drugs in the month
before their offense.  Seventy-five percent reported having used
marijuana in the past.[14]
<P>
Drugs numb the conscience and lower inhibitions.  They contribute
to mood disorders and depression and low self esteem.  A high
proportion of cocaine users admit the drug makes them feel violent
at times.
<P>
Consider some recent examples of youth violence that involved
drug abuse.
<P>
<LI>Five Dodge City, Kansas teenagers, high on marijuana,
killed a stranger for no obvious reason.[15]
<P>
<LI>Three West Palm Beach, Florida teenagers mixed beer,
rum, marijuana and cocaine and then kidnapped and set ablaze a
tourist from Brooklyn.[16]
<P>
<LI>A New Scandia Township, Minnesota teen shot his mother
and stepfather to death.  He admitted to almost daily abuse of
marijuana.[17]
<P>
<LI>Two Miami, Florida teenagers were smoking marijuana
when one accidentally shot and killed the other.[18]
<P>
Social scientists confirm the relationship between drug use and
juvenile deliquency.  A 1990 study published in the <I>Journal
of Drug Issues</I> found the strongest association between the
severity of the crime and the type of substance used -- the more
intoxicating the substance, the more serious the incident.[19]
<P>
A study in <I>Today's Delinquent</I> found alcohol and marijuana
users commit twice the number of delinquent acts as non-users,
and a study in <I>Adolescence</I> found that half of all polydrug
users had engaged in delinquent acts.[20]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE CULTURE'S PRO-DRUG INFLUENCE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Evidence of &quot;drug glorification&quot; in the culture is pervasive.[21]
<P>
Maureen Ketchum, executive director of the Youth Leadership Institute
in San Francisco, states, &quot;Some young people see that to
be hip, sexy, cool they have to drink, party and take drugs....Pop
culture is a factor and young people emulate what is put out there
to emulate.  The industry creates the norm and people live up
to it.&quot;[22]
<P>
Phil Salzman, director of the Gloucester [Massachusetts] Prevention
Network, which works with teenagers in school, writes, &quot;The
power of being accepted and wanting to be normal is a lot stronger
than the truth in the antidrug message....If there is a party
with beer, pot and 60 kids, the norm is determined by the majority
behavior.&quot;[23]
<P>
&quot;Woodstock '94&quot; shows that the sex-drug-rock counterculture
of the 1960s is not dead.  It was temporarily stalled in the 1980s
when the Reagan administration, activists and citizen groups mobilized
against it.  But youth drug use has not disappeared.  And glamorization
of drug use in the industry appears to be on the rise.  Consider
the evidence.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DRUGS ARE A MAINSTAY IN ROCK AND RAP MUSIC</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML)
has counted 45 music groups that have declared their support for
legalizing marijuana.[24] Here is a profile of some of the pro-drug
groups.  
<P>
<LI>The Black Crowes often unfurl a 48 x 24 foot curtain
bearing a marijuana leaf and the words &quot;Free Us&quot; at
their shows and sell rolling paper for marijuana cigarettes on
the side.[25] They wear trousers covered with images of cannabis
leaves.  Lead singer Chris Robinson told rock magazine <I>High
Times</I>, &quot;We did 350 shows, smoked every night and never
got busted.&quot;  He explains, &quot;Pot's got nothing to be
taboo about, man.  It's part of pop culture.&quot;[26] 
<P>
<LI>Cypress Hill, a rap group, cites the history of marijuana
on the inside cover of its compact disc, &quot;Black Sunday.&quot;
 That disc includes the songs &quot;Legalize It,&quot; &quot;I
Wanna Get High,&quot; &quot;Stoned Is the Way of the Walk,&quot;
and &quot;Light Another.&quot;  Group member Sen Dog states, &quot;We
made it popular to be into the blunt,&quot; which refers to the
trendy practice of smoking a hollowed-out Philly Blunt cigar packed
with marijuana.  Their 1993 album has sold more than a million
copies and included the hit single, &quot;Insane in the Membrane.&quot;[27]
<P>
<LI>Tom Petty's double platinum album &quot;Wildflowers&quot;
includes &quot;You Don't Know How It Feels,&quot; which has the
line, &quot;But let's get to the point, let's roll another joint.&quot;
 Another song on the same album, &quot;It's Good to Be King,&quot;
includes the line, &quot;It's good to get high and never come
down.&quot;  And Petty's non-album track titled, &quot;Girl on
LSD,&quot; has the following lyrics, &quot;Through ecstasy, crystal
methane glue, I've found no drug compares to you.... I was in
love with a girl on LSD.&quot;
<P>
<LI>Green Day's album, &quot;Dookie,&quot; which has sold
more than five million copies, includes songs like &quot;Basket
Case,&quot; with the lyrics, &quot;I think I'm cracking up.  Am
I just paranoid?  I'm just stoned.&quot;  Green Day bassist Mike
Dirnt told <I>Rolling Stone</I>, &quot;I think drinking and doing
drugs are very important.... [He comments on a recent concert.]
 I was flying on acid so hard, I was laying up against the wall
with my bass lying on my lap.&quot;  Tre Cool, Green Day's drummer,
said, &quot;When people bring weed to our shows, that's wonderful.
 I'm the guinea pig.  If somebody throws a bag of weed onstage,
Billie will watch to make sure we don't get all [expletive deleted]
on it, but I dive right in.&quot;  Billie Joe Armstrong concludes,
&quot;...Tre really likes pot -- but the main thing of choice
was speed.  People think that we're this big pot-smoking band
even though we sound like an amphetamine band, but I dabbled a
lot in speed for a long time.  That was the drug of choice on
the scene I came from.&quot;  The band, originally named Sweet
Children, renamed itself in 1989 &quot;after one of its songs
about hanging out and smoking pot.&quot; [28]
<P>
<LI>Nine Inch Nails' album, &quot;The Downward Spiral,&quot;
includes &quot;My Self Destruct&quot; with the lyrics, &quot;I
am the needle in your vein and I control you, I am the high you
can't sustain and I control you.&quot;  &quot;Hurt&quot; has the
following lyric, &quot;The needle tears a hole, the old familiar
sting, try to kill it all away.&quot;  &quot;Hurt&quot; explores
drugs as a means of escape.  Lead singer, Trent Reznor, was voted
<I>Spin</I> magazine's &quot;Best Artist&quot; for 1995, and Nine
Inch Nails was voted the &quot;Best Metal Band&quot; in 1995 by
<I>Rolling Stone</I> readers.  
<P>
<LI>Time Warner distributes an album by rapper Dr. Dre
titled, &quot;The Chronic,&quot; a slang term for a potent strain
of marijuana.  The cover features marijuana leaves.  The album
peaked at number two on the Billboard charts, stayed in the top
10 for eight months, and has sold more than three million copies.
<P>
<LI>The Beastie Boys' latest album, &quot;Ill Communications,&quot;
includes a pro-pot song, &quot;Legalize the weed, and I'll say,
'Thank heavens.'&quot;  The Beastie Boys were declared &quot;Best
Rappers&quot; by <I>Spin</I> and <I>Rolling Stone</I> magazines
for 1995.
<P>
<LI>Snoop Doggy Dogg's album &quot;Doggystyle,&quot; includes
a rap, &quot;Bathtub,&quot; which states, &quot;You can smoke
a pound of bud [marijuana] every day...That's the American dream&quot;
and another, &quot;Gin and Juice,&quot; which states, &quot;Rolling
down the street smoking indo [Indonesian marijuana], sippin' on
gin and juice,&quot; and a third, &quot;Tha Shiznit,&quot; which
states, &quot;I gotta fat bud, sack full of chronic in my back
pocket...Need myself a lighter so I can take a smoke.  I smoke
every day.&quot;  Snoop Doggy Dogg was arrested on December 21,
1994 in Lake Charles, LA, for possession of marijuana and drug
paraphernalia.  He was named by <I>Rolling Stone</I> as &quot;Best
Rap Group&quot; for 1995.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DRUG MUSIC'S IMPACT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Parent's Music Resource Center reports that teens listen to
an estimated 10,500 hours of rock music between the seventh and
12th grades alone -- just 500 hours less than the total time they
spend in school over 12 years.  Typical estimates are that the
standard teen listens to rock music four to six hours each day.[29]
<P>
Dr. Joseph Stuessey, professor of music history at the University
of Texas, told the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee that, &quot;Music
affects behavior.  This simple fact has been known intuitively
for centuries.... In the 20th century, especially in the last
four decades, tons of research has been done on the interrelationship
of music and human behavior.... It affects our moods, our attitudes,
our emotions, and our behavior.  It affects us psychologically
and physiologically.&quot;[30]
<P>
Child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr. Robert Demski identifies
music as one of the most powerful influences on youth.[31]
<P>
Dr. Sheila Davis, a professor of lyric writing at New York University,
states that songs &quot;are more than mere mirrors of society;
they are a potent force in the shaping of it....[P]opular songs...provide
the primary `equipment for living' for America's youth.&quot;[32]
<P>
Child psychologist Dr. David Elkind writes in <I>The Hurried Child,</I>
&quot;Music can influence young people as much as any visual media.&quot;[33]
<P>
Pharmacologist Dr. Avram Goldstein of Stanford University writes
in <I>Physiological Psychology</I> that for 96 percent of the
respondents in his study, their biggest thrills came from music.[34]
<P>
Dr. Paul King, medical director of the adolescent program at Charter
Lakeside Hospital in Memphis, warns that &quot;80 percent of the
teenagers he treats have listened to heavy metal rock several
hours a day.&quot;[35]
<P>
<H3><CENTER>MTV'S TREATMENT OF ILLICIT DRUG USE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Dennis Cooper writes in the March 1995 edition of <I>Spin</I>,
a rock music magazine, that pro-drug visual images are especially
provoking.  He explains, &quot;Just the mention of the word
'heroin' in a lyric, or a photograph of a hypodermic
on a CD cover, or the sight of junkie musicians all wrapped up
in some glamorous video, and they [recovering addicts] go crazy
with longing for the stuff.&quot;[36]
<P>
Researchers have found that the marriage between television and
music is powerful.&quot;  The video clarifies the meaning of a
song.[37] MTV's meteoric rise in popularity evidences the power.
 According to the authors of <I>Dancing in the Dark</I>, an eleven-month
study of the growing, changing, and powerful influence of music
and media on youth, music television is &quot;one of the most
powerful forms of contemporary propaganda.&quot;[38]
<P>
MTV founder Robert Pittman explains music television's impact
on youth:  &quot;We're dealing with a culture of TV babies.  They
can watch, do their homework, and listen to music all at the same
time.... At MTV we don't shoot for the fourteen year olds, we
own them.&quot;[39]
<P>
Author Donna Gaines explains, &quot;With MTV, drug use has just
taken on the status of a commodity.&quot;[40] Video director Samuel
Bayer disagrees.  He gives MTV more credit: &quot;I grew up in
the '70s, when there were drug references all over the place....
Kids are smart enough to read between the lines.  Something like
Kurt Cobain dying -- that's what happens when your life is [expletive
deleted].  If anything, videos have the opposite effect.&quot;[41]
<P>
MTV has a drug policy.  Carole Robinson, a senior vice president
at MTV, says that her network does not &quot;promote, glamorize,
or show as socially acceptable the use of illegal drugs or the
abuse of legal drugs.&quot;[42] But Cooper points out, &quot;You
don't need a degree in deconstruction to see the signs of drugginess
all over MTV, whether it's Alice in Chains' elegant little travelogues
of junkie life, or Ministry's 'Just One Fix' clip, in which heroin
withdrawal is given a snazzy, action-packed movie-trailer look,
or even Tori Amos's clip for 'God,' in which a character simulates
'tying off.'  If kids are smart enough to know what's fiction
and what's not, then they are smart enough to decode these kinds
of messages too.&quot;[43]
<P>
Cooper compares MTV's drug policy to a makeup artist's covering
of crow's-feet on an aging actress.  &quot;Pot leaves, pills,
and hypodermic needles are successfully smudged beyond recognition,
but the subtleties remain.&quot;[44]
<P>
MTV and Black Entertainment Television (BET) digitally blur images
of marijuana leaves and names in music videos, such as Dr. Dre's
&quot;Nothing but a G Thang&quot; which features men wearing baseball
caps emblazoned with marijuana leaves.[45] A former member of several
prominent alternative rock bands told Cooper, &quot;I can't even
watch MTV anymore, it's so full of junkies.  I can spot them in
an instant, and I feel like they're calling to me from this terrible
and fascinating place in my past.&quot;[46]
<P>
MTV aired a pro-drug program, &quot;Straight Dope&quot; on August
27, 1994.  Host Kurt Loder introduces the program stating, &quot;We
are going to spend the next hour taking a very close look at drugs,
what they are, what they do to people who use them, and how well
or poorly official government prohibition, the eight-year long
war on drugs, has worked.&quot;
<P>
A teen on the program says, &quot;It's not like I'm trying to
commit suicide or anything -- it's no worse than drinking coffee,
smoking a cigarette, drinking a beer, or taking a shot of tequila.&quot;
<P>
Loder portrays some drug users as rational, everyday people who
are minimally affected by the illicit substances.  The three-part
film was publicized for public school use by &quot;MTV Community
of the Future&quot; and is endorsed by the National Education
Association.  MTV offers &quot;teacher support material&quot;
to help with classroom discussions.[47]
<P>
<H3><CENTER>YOUTH PRINT MEDIA ENCOURAGE ILLICIT DRUG USE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The May 5, 1994 edition of <I>Rolling Stone</I> is headlined,
&quot;Drugs in America:  The Phony War, the Real Crisis.&quot;
 The magazine is devoted to a pro-drug message.
<P>
The March 1995 edition of <I>Details</I>, a pop culture magazine,
includes an article about the Sativa Hemp Store in San Marcos,
Texas, which stamps dollar bills with the words &quot;I grew hemp&quot;
coming out of George Washington's mouth.  The first president
grew rope hemp at his Northern Virginia estate, Mount Vernon.
 &quot;Hemp activists say the stamp helps to draw attention to
the utility -- and former respectability -- of the plant.&quot;[48]
<P>
Drug advertisements are in many metal, rap and hip hop magazines.
 The college edition of <I>Rolling Stone</I> recently included
an invitation to join NORML which states, &quot;Every 2 minutes,
another American is arrested on marijuana charges.  You could
be next!&quot;[49] Another ad solicits for a bumpersticker, &quot;There's
no hope -- let's do dope.&quot;  <I>Rolling Stone's</I> December,
1994 Double Issue (December 29, 1994 to January 12, 1995) advertises
a &quot;Genuine Ostrich Egg&quot; with a marijuana leaf and the
words &quot;Get High Tonight&quot; emblazoned on the egg.[50] 
<P>
<I>Q</I> magazine's February 1995 edition contains an ad, &quot;Grow
Yer' Own, The Home-Gro Company, Everything You Need to Grow the
Best!!!&quot; [51] February, 1995's <I>Relix</I> advertises for &quot;Indoor
Grow Lights&quot; and adds the bold statement, &quot;We sell lights
<B>that's all we do</B> just mail order, just lights!&quot;[52]
<P>
The same edition of <I>Relix</I> includes a very sympathetic article
entitled &quot;Families Against Mandatory Minimums.&quot;[53] FAMM
president Julie Stewart's brother is serving a five-year term
for cultivation of marijuana.  She accuses the Drug Enforcement
Agency of preying on naive Grateful Dead fans.  &quot;They are
not serious professional drug dealers and so they don't expect
the person who they're selling drugs to, to be an undercover agent.&quot;[54]
 Stewart makes her case by stating, &quot;[T]he drug offenders
are actually pushing violent offenders out of prison because the
violent offenders do not have a mandatory minimum time that they
have to serve.&quot;[55]
<P>
<I>Relix</I> includes a section inviting readers to write to &quot;Incarcerated
Deadheads.&quot;[56] Although the section does not list their convictions,
a personal ad reads, &quot;Help!  In April of 1986 I was arrested
at Irvine Meadows for possession.&quot;[57]
<P>
&quot;Friday at Four&quot; is an America Online interactive computer
talk show with special guests.  It recently hosted Yale law professor
Steven Duke, who taught President Clinton and is the pro-drug
author of <I>America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade
Against Drugs</I>.  
<P>
Duke responded to questions about drugs.  He said that banned
drugs should be legalized &quot;Absolutely, without a doubt, immediately!&quot;
 He favors lifting the ban on &quot;marijuana, opiates (heroin
and morphine) and cocaine, including crack.&quot;  He also promoted
needle exchanges.  He explained, &quot;I think drug prohibition
causes half of our serious crime....Our biggest problem, worst
drug problem is the tobacco problem.  Legalizing drugs will reduce
the use of alcohol, which is far more damaging than any popular
illegal drug.&quot;[58]
<P>
Even the popular &quot;Dear Abby&quot; syndicated advice column
has gone pro-drug.  Abigail Van Buren recently wrote in favor
of legalization.  She wrote, &quot;The legalization of drugs would
put drug dealers out of business.&quot;[59]
<P>
<H3><CENTER>CALLING ALL PARENTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Government leaders and scientists recognize that curbing drug
abuse requires positive prevention programs, messages to counter
the pro-drug cultural bent, strong enforcement, and involved parents.
<P>
Joseph Podgorski, a principal of Amherst Central High School near
Buffalo, New York, faults parental naivete for teen drug abuse.
 &quot;There is certainly a lot of drinking going on, especially
on the weekends, and I'm sure there is casual drug use...The biggest
problem is trying to get kids' parents to admit that their kids
have a problem.  A lot of it is just not wanting to deal with
it.&quot;[60]
<P>
Numerous studies show that parents can make the difference for
children faced with peer and cultural pressures to take illicit
drugs.  For example, a study in the <I>Journal of Children in
Contemporary Society</I> found that childhood predictors of adolescent
substance abuse include: family history of drug abuse, family
management and discipline styles, family communication patterns,
and the child's own early use of the gateway drugs.[61]
<P>
A 1985 NIDA study of the use of illegal drugs among children states
that &quot;traditionality, family intactness, self-awareness,
monitoring, and firmness&quot; are parental traits found in the
families of drug-free children.[62]
<P>
A 1990 study in the <I>Journal of Youth and Adolescents</I> considered
peer versus parental influence for substance use.  It found that
parents are the most influential people in the teenager's life,
both for drug users (63.2 percent) and abstainers (79.1 percent).
 Abstaining teens still go to their parents first (66 percent)
when problems arise.  However, drug-using teens tend to go to
friends more often with their problems.[63]
<P>
There are conflicting studies which found that friends and peers
have replaced parents as the greatest influencers of teen values.
 And for the 1990s quite possibly the media will emerge as dominant.
 <I>Dancing in the Dark</I> warns, &quot;Youth...need the media
for guidance and nurture in a society where other social institutions,
such as the family and the school, do not shape the youth culture
as powerfully as they once did.&quot;[64]
<P>
<H3><CENTER>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Lois Haight chaired a 1988 White House Conference
on a Drug-Free America.  She heard from 1,000 recovering addicts
who unanimously gave the same heartfelt message, &quot;Make it
difficult, very difficult to use [illicit drugs], because if you
don't, the lure and seductiveness of the 'high' will prevail.&quot;[65]
<P>
Youth attitudes and behaviors have changed with regard to the
threat associated with illicit drugs.  Although the culture has
increasingly embraced pro-drug messages, concerned citizens can
effectively counter these negative influences by educating themselves
to the threat and exercising their responsibility to listen and
lovingly guide children to &quot;Just Say No&quot; to drugs.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>1. Why does FRC exist and what do they stand 
for?</h2></center>

<p>

The Family Research Council's primary reason for existence is
to reaffirm and promote nationally and particularly in Washington,
DC, the traditional family unit and the Judeo-Christian principles
upon which it is built.  To accomplish this task we will:

<p><ul>

<li>Promote and defend the family in the media.
<li>Develop and advocate legislative and public policy initiatives
which strengthen and fortify the family and promote traditional
values.
<li>Establish and maintain an accurate source of statistical and
research information which reaffirms the importance of the family
in our civilization.
<li>Inform and educate citizens on how they can promote biblical
principles in our culture.

</ul><p>

<h3>FRC stands for:</h3>

<p><ol>

<b>The American Family</b>

<p>

<li>To ease growing economic pressures on families, federal and
state tax policy should allow parents raising children to keep
more of the money they earn.

<li>Fathers play an irreplaceable role in the upbringing of their
children.   They should take these responsibilities seriously.

<li>The natural, married-couple family is the best environment
to bear and raise children.  Public policy should protect the
two-parent family.

<li>America's child protection policies should be reformed to
be more sensitive to the rights of the parents.

<li>The best child care program is one a child receives in his
or her own home, from his or her own parents.  Congress and employers
should therefore adopt policies which make it easier for parents
to care for their own children.

<li>Adults should make every effort toward reconciliation before
considering divorce.  Congress and the state should encourage
this by limiting or repealing current &quot;no fault&quot; divorce
policies.

<p>

<b>The Preservation and Sanctity of Human Life</b>

<p>

<li>Human life is sacred and should be protected -- from conception
until natural death.

<li>Adoption should be strongly advocated, particularly as an
alternative to abortion.

<li>Taking organs from aborted children for experimental purposes
is morally repugnant.  The medial community should find alternatives
to this practice.

<p>

<b>Making our Schools Great Again</b>

<p>

<li>Parents should be free to direct their children's education;
government should respect the right of parents to choose safe and effective
schools for their children.

<li>A child's performance in school should be judged by academic
achievement, not whether the child becomes &quot;politically correct.&quot;

<li>Voluntary student-initiated prayer should be allowed in public
schools.

<li>Schools should teach abstinence before marriage and fidelity
within marriage, keeping in mind that parents bear the primary
responsibility for their children's sex education.

<p>

<b>Pro-Family Health Care Reform</b>

<p>

<li>America's health care system should be flexible enough to
meet each individual family's needs and should also respect the
right of each family to make its own health care choices.

<li>The best method for controlling the spread of AIDS is for
people to change their behavior, avoiding activities which would
put them at risk of acquiring the HIV virus.

<p>

<b>The Family and Society</b>

<p>

<li>Homosexual activity is immoral, unhealthy, and destructive
to individuals, families and societies.  Homosexuals should not
be granted special rights based on their sexual preference.  &quot;Gay
rights&quot; should not be equated with civil rights.

<li>Homosexuals should be treated with compassion, not bigotry.
We should provide support and healing for homosexuals who want
to change their way of life.

<li>It is destructive for military morale, readiness, and effectiveness
to permit homosexuals into the armed forces.

<p>

<b>Family</b>

<p>

<li>Tax dollars should not be used to fund obscene or indecent
art.

<li>It is essential that concerned citizens take part in the
political process, not just be passive observers.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>2. What does FRC think about AIDS funding?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that funding and AIDS prevention should be redirected
in ways commensurate with the threat to the entire population.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> AIDS is a serious threat that has already
claimed a quarter million lives.  However, it enjoys a much higher
share of available prevention, research and treatment dollars
than other equally devastating diseases, and this must change.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> In Fiscal Year 1996, the Department
of Health and Human Services will spend $5.35 billion directly
on AIDS, the highest per-victim expenditure for any of the nation's
10 most lethal diseases.

<p>

AIDS ranks near the bottom of the list of the top 10 mortal diseases
and last year accounted for about 42,000 deaths.  Meanwhile, heart
disease claimed 730,000 lives, and cancer killed 520,000.  Yet
this year, HHS will spend more on research for each AIDS death
($33,333) than for each death from heart disease ($1,201) or cancer
($4,615).

<p>

The point is not that AIDS should cease receiving serious attention.
HIV is a contagious and uniformly fatal disease, and its victims
deserve compassion and help.  Funding should continue for treatment,
prevention and care.  However, AIDS funding must be brought into
line with expenditures for other life-threatening diseases, and
the money must be redirected toward more effective approaches.

<p>

For many years, AIDS policy has been driven by the demands of
HIV-infected people who dominate AIDS organizations.  Their situations
are tragic, and their focus on finding a cure is understandable.
But because of their considerable influence, the lion's share
of AIDS funding has been spent for treatment of end-stage HIV
(AIDS) and not on the full spectrum of HIV disease.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Far more Americans die each year from cancer or
heart disease than AIDS.  Government should allocate resources
in proportion to the need.  To defeat the AIDS epidemic, government
must focus a larger share of AIDS funding on prevention.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>3. What does FRC think about adoption?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC encourages and promotes the adoption of children by two-parent
families as a superior alternative to abortion, out-of-wedlock
parenting, and foster care.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> (1) Passage of a $5,000 adoption tax credit
for couples who choose to adopt a child.  (2) Removal of policy
barriers which discourage interracial adoptions.  (3) Amendment
of the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act so that Indian tribes would
no longer be able to retroactively overturn an adoption which
was approved by the child's biological parents.  (4) Encouragement
of crisis pregnancy centers, maternity homes, and family planning
clinics to provide adoption counseling for their unmarried pregnant
clients. (5) Shortening the time frame for biological parents
to make custodial claims so that children do not languish for
years in foster care, but are eligible for adoption sooner.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Adoption typically provides children
with a permanent, stable, and loving home.  It helps to break
the cycles of illegitimacy, single parenthood, abortion, and welfare
dependency.  And for foster care children, adoption also acts
as a preventative measure against being involved in crime, being
incarcerated, or becoming welfare-dependent.

<p>

Public opinion polls show that the American people consistently
support the choice of adoption.  For example, the Family Research
Council's &quot;1995 Family Issues Survey&quot; found that, when
presented with four options to resolve out-of-wedlock pregnancies
(adoption, marriage to the birthfather, single parenthood, or
abortion), more respondents chose adoption as the best option
than any of the others.  In reality, however, 46 percent of all
nonmarital pregnancies in 1991 ended in induced abortion, 10 percent
ended in miscarriage, and 44 percent were carried to term, of
which only 2 percent were placed for adoption.  So while the number
of potentially adoptable children is theoretically large due to
the high number of out-of-wedlock births and crisis pregnancies,
there remains a relatively small number of adoptable children.
Consequently, an estimated one to two million prospective parents
are still waiting to adopt a child.

<p>

Currently, there are 500,000 children in foster care, only a portion
of whom are legally adoptable at any one time.  Of these foster
children, 50,000 who are &quot;free&quot; to be adopted remain
in foster care for months or years.  Furthermore, every year,
15,000 children &quot;graduate&quot; from the foster care system
by turning 18 with no permanent family.  That these children languish
in foster care year after year is primarily attributable to two
reasons:  (1) The overriding emphasis on race-matching the child
with his/her adoptive parents has often led to major delays or
denials of adoptions, even when transracial adoptive homes are
available; and (2) The foster care system places an undue, and
often misguided, emphasis on returning children to their biological
parents, even when there are clear indications that the biological
parents have forfeited their custodial claims by abusing or neglecting
their children.  Thus, these children languish in foster care
even when adoptive homes are available.  If they are finally released
for adoption, many of them are much harder to place because they
are older and have generally acquired more behavioral problems.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Adoption benefits everyone.  It benefits the young,
unmarried birthmother and her life chances to finish school and
escape the welfare-dependency cycle.  It meets the child's needs
for stability and has a positive effect on the child's physical,
emotional, and psychological health.  It benefits the adoptive
parents who desire to have a family.  It benefits American society
because the children are reared in solid, two-parent homes without
cost to the American taxpayer.  It also provides a superior alternative
to out-of-wedlock parenting and abortion.  By promoting and enabling
adoptions to occur more easily, more children will have the opportunity
to be raised in loving, two-parent homes rather than to suffer
the vagaries that come with being wards of the state through
foster care or welfare-dependency.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>4. What does FRC think about child care?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that federal child care policies must respect a range
of private choices without undermining intact families or placing
an undue tax burden on middle-class parents.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Resistance to calls for the creation of
a new federal child care entitlement; protection of the voucher
provisions in the existing child care and child development block
grant (with the proviso that vouchers may be used at sectarian
institutions); passage of tax credits that do not discriminate
against either non-commercial care or one-career families.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Federally-funded child care programs
are a staple of the liberal agenda to replace the nuclear family
with the total state.  It is no coincidence that the opening shot
in the political battle over the family was the passage in 1971
of Senator Walter Mondale's Comprehensive Child Development bill.
An archetype of liberal social engineering, the Mondale bill
sought to place as many children as possible under the care of
federally-funded child advocates and day care centers.  In his
veto message, President Nixon wrote that &quot;good public policy
requires that we enhance rather than diminish both parental authority
and parental involvement with children -- particularly in those
decisive early years when social attitudes and a conscience are
formed, and religious and moral principles are first inculcated.&quot;

<p>

While acknowledging that not all mothers can choose to stay at
home with children, contemporary child care policy must preserve
as many choices as possible -- including at-home care, church-based
care, and other informal arrangements.  Any expansion of federal
oversight, by definition, will limit options and pose regulatory
entanglements.  New federal funding will inflate the tax burden
on two-parent families and force many parents to spend more time
at the job site -- less time with the children.

<p>

Welfare reform that imposes stiff work requirements on mothers
of preschool children threatens to distort child care policy by
creating new sympathy for greater federal intrusion.  To reduce
the need for day care services -- and to assimilate welfare recipients
into the labor force more successfully -- welfare reform must
focus first on the mothers with older children in school.  Research
studies on various &quot;workfare&quot; experiments show a low
success rate for sustained employment by unmarried mothers with
preschool children, who face much greater role strain and task
overload than mothers with school-aged children.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> While decentralization ensures flexibility and
greater responsiveness to individual needs, vouchers ensure that
parents themselves retain maximum say in determining what is best
for their children.  Advocates of greater federal involvement
operate instead on the assumption that bureaucrats and licensed
&quot;experts&quot; know best.  Policymakers must acknowledge
that no paid worker can be an adequate substitute for a loving
parent -- and work to eliminate both the tax burden and the culture
of poverty that restrict families' economic freedom to care for
their own children.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>5. What does FRC think about China having &quot;most 
favored nation&quot; trade status?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the United States should take a strong stand
against China's human rights violations and revoke their &quot;most
favored nation&quot; trade status.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Revoke &quot;most favored nation&quot;
trade status for China.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> China's atrocious record on human
rights is indisputable.  Its blatant disregard for the sanctity
of human life has led to such abuses as the massacre of democracy-seekers
at Tiananmen Square, the exploitation of prisoners as slave laborers,
women being forcibly aborted or sterilized, female infanticide,
and the systematic intimidation, torture, and imprisonment of
Christians.

<p>

For the last 15 years, the United States has extended &quot;most
favored nation&quot; trade status to China.  Some have argued
that, by opening up our economic doors to China, the United States
will wield greater influence in reversing China's horrific human
rights record.  However, in the last 15 years, not even one of
these human rights abuses has been halted or abated.  Indeed,
China's human rights abuses have only worsened over that time,
and the Chinese government has grown more stubborn in its control-by-force
and intimidation tactics.

<p>

In addition to the myriad human rights abuses which alone should
disqualify China from receiving MFN status, in the last year alone
China has also threatened war with Taiwan, risking a military
confrontation with the United States; sold missiles and nuclear
technology to rogue nations (some of whom fund terrorists); and
balked at talks with the U.S. and South Korea.  Furthermore, because
the United States is currently running a $33.8 billion trade deficit
with China, there is reason to believe that revoking China's MFN
status may help to make an impact on China's leaders.

<p>

The Clinton administration has recently signaled that it will
extend MFN to China again this year.  Since the president will
not stand up to China, it will be up to Congress to pass legislation 
with a two-thirds majority in both Houses to overturn the president's 
decision by the end of August.  The oppressive nature of this Chinese 
government regime is well-known.  If the United States has not succeeded
in using the &quot;carrot&quot; of economic markets to encourage
China to meet a humane standard, then the &quot;stick&quot; should
be the revoking of China's trade privileges.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Revoking China's MFN trade status is a modest,
but significant step that the United States must take in order
to demonstrate tangibly that it will not tolerate the large-scale
human rights abuses taking place in China.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>6. What does FRC think about crime prevention?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC supports and encourages efforts to combat crime at all levels
to ensure that law-abiding Americans feel safe in our streets.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> (1) Sentencing and prison reform. (2) Reforms
in criminal procedure. (3) More aggressive enforcement.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b>

<p>

(1) <I>Sentencing and prison reform</I>:

<p>

Serious repeat violent felons must be put away permanently.  Recidivism
figures show clearly that many criminals, once released, return
to a life of crime.

<p>

Government must protect the public by keeping violent criminals
behind bars for their entire sentences and eliminating bail for
suspects.

<p>

Adolescents who commit &quot;adult&quot; crimes should be tried
as adults and subjected to adult penalties.

<p>

Criminals must be punished, not pampered.  Recidivism is high
among violent offenders partly because the price they pay for
crime is too low.

<p>

Other means of punishment, such as restitution, might be used
for less-serious offenses.  This could help relieve an overburdened
prison system.

<p>

No one advocates cruelty or harsh, meaningless labor such as the
old &quot;making little rocks out of big ones.&quot;  But prisons
should be places of punishment, not weight-lifting and entertainment
centers.

<p>

(2) <I>Reforms in criminal procedure</I>.

<p>

The death penalty, affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1976, must
be used where it is justified if it is to deter crime.

<p>

Habeas corpus loopholes that permit criminals to exploit the courts
must be closed.  The impact of the Comprehensive Terrorism Act
of 1995 must be carefully monitored to ensure that the loopholes
have been closed.

<p>

The exclusionary rule should be changed.  The exclusionary rule
was created by the courts to implement the Fourth Amendment (all
persons have the right to be secure from unreasonable searches
and seizures) thus protecting the public from police abuses. 
But the rule has been used to unfairly favor criminals.  It must
be modified to deny freedom to the guilty, give incentives for
police professionalism and protect civil liberties.

<p>

Jury reform is long overdue.  Jury members ought to be able to
ask questions that trial attorneys and prosecutors may miss. 
They should also be informed of the defendant's past criminal
history, especially during sentencing considerations where either
mitigating circumstances or a track record of incorrigible behavior
is significant.

<p>

(3) <I>More aggressive enforcement</I>.

<p>

Increase the prison population to reduce crime.  Statistics show
that most crime is committed by a core of chronic criminals. 
Keeping these criminals in jail for longer periods will make society
safer.

<p>

More local police -- to guard our schools, neighborhoods and commerce
-- are necessary to free our citizens to go about their daily
lives without fear.

<p>

Government must protect law-abiding citizens from recidivist sex
felons.  An example of this is the recently-passed &quot;Megan's
Law.&quot;*   It requires state governments to disclose information
and notify communities about convicted sex offenders who are released
from prison.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Crime costs America half-a-trillion dollars every
year.  It leaves thousands of killed and injured people in its
wake.  In order to prevent the next decade's much-anticipated
youth crime explosion, major anti-crime reform is desperately
needed.

<p>

* &quot;Megan's Law&quot; amends the Violent Crime Control and
Law Enforcement Act of 1994.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>7. What does FRC think about defunding public arts and 
humanities that support cultural decay?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that most of America's troubles stem more from moral
decline than from economic problems.  Part of FRC's goal is to
spark a cultural renewal that will be evident in music, arts,
literature, film, television, and other parts of our culture.
FRC believes there should be an end to taxpayer funding of public
arts and humanities and broadcast programs that attack the family,
religion and traditional values, and/or promote an ideological
agenda.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b>  Defunding the National Endowment for the
Arts (NEA), the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The National Endowment for the
Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities began in 1965
with budgets of $2.5 million.  The two agencies' budgets reached
more than $175 million each per year in the 1990s.  NEA was cut
to just under $100 million in fiscal 1996,  to be phased out after
1997.  NEH was cut to $110 million in fiscal 1996, with a planned
phaseout after 1998.

<p>

Unlike any other arts sponsor, the federal government has unique
authority and responsibility.  A federal grant instantly conveys
the stamp of approval of the federal government and the American
people.

<p>

Federal arts funding, an unconstitutional expansion of government 
power, has skewed the art market toward questionable projects.
NEA continues to fund such venues as the Franklin Furnace Archive
theater in New York, where artists engage in scatological, sexually-explicit,
anti-religious and anti-family &quot;performance&quot; works.
NEA Chairwoman Jane Alexander told the pro-gay <I>Advocate</I> magazine
that she intended to use the NEA to &quot;introduce people gently
to gay themes all across the country.  And I mean gently, because
if you start with a very overt thing, people get scared.&quot;
Alexander also defended a performance at an NEA-funded art center
in which an HIV-positive man sliced another man's back with a
knife, mopped up blood and sent it over the audience on clotheslines.

<p>

At the NEH,  money has been wasted on politically correct projects
such as the promotion of &quot;cultural diversity&quot; and the
&quot;National Conversation on American Pluralism and Identity.&quot;
When one activist used the latter forum to state that, &quot;There
is nothing about me that is American.  I don't want to be an American,&quot;
NEH Director Sheldon Hackney exulted, &quot;What an American thing
to say -- squarely in the great tradition of American dissent.&quot;

<p>

In 1967, Congress created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
overseer of the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public
Radio.  CPB's budget grew to nearly $285 million by fiscal 1996.
In fiscal 1997, CPB is to receive $260 million, with a request
for $296.4 million for 1998.  No phaseout has been enacted.

<p>

America has more than 11,700 radio stations, 3,100 television
licensees, 109 cable networks and another 6,963 translators and
boosters, plus the Internet. There is no reason to tax hardworking
American families to subsidize PBS or NPR shows.  Although PBS
and NPR have some worthy fare, there is a drumbeat of anti-family
and anti-religious programming.  Political bias is rampant.

<p>

CPB subsidies are not needed.  <I>Sesame Street</I> can make it
on its own, while bad programs would and should fail in an open
market.  Some congressmen have talked about creating a $1 billion
trust fund for PBS without any congressional oversight.  More
money and <I>less</I> oversight?  It's time to defund the NEA,
NEH and CPB.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The saving of hundreds of millions of dollars
annually and an end to tax-subsidized attacks on family, religion,
sexual morality and free enterprise.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>8. What is FRC's stand on divorce reform?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes there needs to be revisions in public policy that
would increase the commitment of society to the institution of
marriage, the protection of children and justice for innocent
parties.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Reform of the current no-fault divorce
laws in every state by establishing fault for grounds and dissolution
where there is no mutual consent.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The current situation began in
1969 when California passed the first &quot;no-fault&quot; divorce
law.  Intended to remove animosity during divorce, reduce perjury
and collusion, establish standards for alimony and property awards
and give relief to marital conflict, no-fault laws passed in 45
states in the next five years.  By 1985, all 50 states had passed
laws establishing no-fault divorce.

<p>

What have been the results of such a significant shift in the
way that we view the marriage contract?  We have shifted from
a culture of marriage to a culture of divorce.  Divorce rates
have surged 34 percent from 1970 to 1990.  It is estimated that
one half of all new marriages will end in divorce.  The United
States is the divorce leader of the industrialized world.  What
are we communicating when it is easier to divorce your wife of
25 years that it is to let go that employee you hired two weeks
ago?

<p>

More specifically, no-fault divorce has had a detrimental affect
on the innocent parties involved, especially the children.  No-fault
divorce reduces the protection and negotiating rights of the spouse
who wants to maintain the marriage.  Divorced women experience
a 30 percent drop in income the first year after a divorce.  Three
out of four teen suicides are committed by children from broken
homes.  Children of divorce are also 70 percent more likely to
have been expelled or suspended from school, and are twice as
likely to drop out of school.  Of juveniles and young adults serving
time in long-term correctional facilities, 70 percent came from
broken homes.

<p>

No-fault divorce has not only added to societal problems, but
it has not remotely addressed the problems it originally set out
to solve.  Animosity during divorce has simply shifted to animosity
during the settlement.  Fights over custody and support are more
prevalent today and just as humiliating as those over grounds.
In the overwhelming majority of cases before the adoption of
no-fault grounds, there was no litigation at all, let alone hostile
litigation.  Perjury and collusion have also just shifted from
the grounds arena to the collateral arenas of custody and visitation.

<p>

Dr. Allen Parkman has summed it up this way:  &quot;Seldom in
U.S. history have laws been enacted with higher hopes and poorer
results than the no-fault divorce statutes.&quot;  Not surprisingly,
in a recent FRC survey, by a margin of 55 percent to 31 percent,
Americans said that they favor divorce reform to strengthen the
rights of spouses who want to save their marriage.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Divorce reform will strengthen our families and
society by increasing the incentive for spouses to invest in their
marriage.  It will offer justice for those who are unwilling parties
of divorce, especially for any children involved.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>9. What national drug abuse policies does FRC 
support?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that:

<p><ol>

<li>The President must give the drug war a high priority.
<li>Congress must hold federal drug spending at current levels
until there is strict accountability, and then consider increasing
budget authority.
<li>The drug czar must be made subordinate to the attorney general
to coordinate all drug interdiction.
<li>Local communities must be allowed to tailor treatment and
prevention programs to local needs.

</ol><p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> America has successfully cut drug
abuse in half since 1979, but now it is rising again and emboldened
drug legalization proponents are calling for a surrender in the
drug war.  The drug war needs leadership, a unified national interdiction
effort, and a local prevention and treatment focus.

<p>

The absence of committed Presidential leadership has contributed
to the problem. President Clinton has been virtually silent about
drug abuse.  He has mentioned drugs in less than three percent
of the public speeches made during the first three years of his
administration.

<p>

The lack of Presidential attention to this issue tracks with a
growing view that illegal drugs are less dangerous and more acceptable.
This shift can be attributed to fewer news stories about the
risks of drugs, more pro-drug information, more legalization discussions,
and glamorization of drugs by pop culture.  In fact, last year,
the major television networks ran only 40 drug stories compared
to nearly 400 per year during the Reagan administration.

<p>

Drug abuse costs the nation perhaps half-a-trillion dollars annually.
The federal government will spend $13 billion fighting the drug
war this year, but much of this money will be spent without close
accountability.  This must change.

<p>

The federal drug effort is complicated by too many programs. 
There are 140 federal programs each with its own bureaucracy and
tangled set of procedures.  This scattershot approach isn't working.
The federal part of the war must focus on interdiction and turn
the rest over to local communities.

<p>

The drug czar should be subordinate to the attorney general just
as the surgeon general falls under the Secretary of Health and
Human Services.  That would eliminate redundancies and improve
the use of taxpayer dollars.  The drug czar should coordinate
the U.S. drug interdiction effort and speak out against abuse.

<p>

Other than the President providing the vision for a drug-free
America, drug treatment and prevention are issues the federal
government is poorly equipped to handle.  Consolidate federal
drug bureaucracies, streamline procedures and send authority and
resources to the local level.  Local communities working with
citizen-run groups can do a far better job than the federal government
at tailoring programs to meet local needs.

<p>

Include faith-based programs in the local solution and take steps
to ensure that government does not interfere in their religious
mission.  They have a proven record of long-term drug abuse recovery
and prevention effectiveness.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Drug abuse ruins lives, acts as a drag on our
economy, damages every American's quality of life via drug-related
crime, and robs America of its intellectual edge in a competitive
world.  This is a national crisis and deserves top priority.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>10. How does FRC believe we can improve the public education
system in America?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that America must restore decision-making authority
over school policy and finance to parents, locally elected school
boards and taxpayers, relieving them of the layers of bureaucracy
that hinder education renewal.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> The federal role in education, now amounting
to several hundred programs, should be terminated and the billions
of dollars spent annually returned to taxpayers.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Education has been traditionally
-- and constitutionally -- a responsibility of states and localities.
But since the U.S. Education Department was created in 1979,
it has followed the iron law of bureaucracies, seeking to expand
its range and influence.  Today, more than 760 education programs
exist in 39 federal agencies, totalling $120 billion in annual
expenditures.

<p>

A new height of federal intrusion into local education was reached
with the passage of Goals 2000 in 1994.  Goals 2000 prescribes
to states how they will run their educational systems and meddles
in their curricular issues by creating national standards and
assessments.  But Goals 2000 also pushes a liberal social agenda,
covering everything from prenatal health care systems to mandatory
community service to comprehensive health education.

<p>

Goals 2000 must be repealed as the first step toward restoring
local schools in America.  Republicans in the 104th Congress demonstrated
their commitment to eliminating wasteful, inappropriate federal
programs and to improving education by seeking to end Goals 2000.
The House voted to eliminate funding for the program in FY '96,
and the House Budget Committee resolved to do so again for FY '97.

<p>

As control has been seized by the centralized education bureaucracy,
local apathy has increased, just as Alexis de Tocqueville predicted
over 150 years ago.  Liberals seek to dictate parental and community
involvement in education through federal law, ignoring the fact
that their own cumbersome programs choke off any meaningful participation.

<p>

Only when the federal role in education is ended will we see a
revitalization of the community involvement that characterized
schools before the advent of the education bureaucracy.   The
proposal to free schools from federal control received a hearty
response in the 104th Congress, where some 120 members of the
House sponsored the Back-to-Basics bill, the first concerted effort
to shut down the U.S. Education Department bureaucracy in the
last decade.

<p>

As part of their freedom to participate fully in their children's
education, parents should be permitted to choose a safe and effective
public, private, religious or home school.  When parents freely
choose the kind of education they seek for their children, employers
will get the qualified employees they want, and policymakers will
see the healthy schools they envision coming to life as a result
of competition.

<p>

Blaise Pascal told us that seeking to obtain by one means what
can only be achieved by another is tyranny.  We have witnessed
in the past three decades an ever-expanding attempt to solve educational
problems from Washington, D.C.  The resulting nationalization
of education has only exacerbated the problems of local schools.
Parents, teachers and schools must be freed from the burdens
of the federal education bureaucracy.  Only then will America
experience the educational renewal that will keep this nation
a leader in the 21st century world.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The elimination of the federal role in education
will allow state and local education to flourish without regulatory
bondage, reestablish the authority of parents and taxpayers over
education, and bring about the education renewal parents desire
and their children need for future success.  Tax relief will allow
families to increase their buying power for current educational
services and to save for future educational needs.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>11. What solutions does FRC see for affordable health 
care?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that families should have access to affordable, portable
health care and insurance for families.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Enactment of tax-free medical savings accounts
(MSAs) as an important cost-saving and freedom-of-choice component
of any health care reform measure.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> A radical overhaul of our nation's
health care system, which is one of the finest in the world, is
not necessary.  Rather, there are certain aspects, such as affordability
and portability, that are amenable to reform without inviting
wholesale federal interference in health care.  Tax-free medical
savings accounts (MSAs) for working families and individuals,
as passed in the House-Senate Balanced Budget Act and the House
health care reform package, constitute one such reform.  MSAs
are similar to IRAs in that pre-tax dollars up to a certain limit
may be set aside for certain medical expenses.  MSAs are controlled
by individuals and families, not by governments or insurance companies.
MSAs usually supplement high-deductible (catastrophic) health
insurance coverage, helping to cover lower-level medical expenses
before the insurance deductible is reached, co-payments, and other
qualified expenses.  Because families and individuals are directly
responsible for the use of their health care dollars, MSAs guard
against the overutilization of health care services, thereby helping
to curb skyrocketing health care costs.  Moreover, families reap
the rewards of managing their health care dollars wisely and of
practicing good health habits, for any monies not spent by the
end of the year may be kept by the individual as taxable income,
or kept in the account for future health care needs.  Since most
individuals spend less than $2,000 per year on medical expenses,
funds in the account would be portable and available in-between
jobs, at the next job, or when bigger unexpected medical costs
come up in the future.

<p>

Companies that offer MSAs have found that they are most popular
among lower-income families.  Under conventional insurance plans,
low-income employees typically have to meet their $250 or $500
deductible with after-tax dollars before they can access their
insurance.  A single mother earning $14,000 or $15,000 a year
may find it difficult to meet the deductible when rent, transportation,
taxes, grocery bills and other needs for her children are pressing.
An MSA allows these low-income earners first dollar coverage,
permitting them to get medical care when they or their children
need it.  This feature alone could significantly reduce 
the level of emergency room utilization for non-emergency care.
Low-income wage earners would have, in effect, first-dollar coverage
for medical care up to the amount in their MSA.

<p>

MSAs also promote greater autonomy in health care choices.  Because
MSA funds may be used toward any medical expenses, including those
not expressly covered within the insurance policy, a family has
more flexibility to choose health services and providers and has
more portability of coverage.

<p>

More and more private sector employers are offering MSAs to their
employees, with great response, even though our federal tax code
discriminates against this practice.  Fifteen states have passed
laws granting favorable tax treatment to MSAs.   In March 1996,
the House of Representatives passed an MSA provision that would
allow comparable tax treatment to other forms of employment-based
insurance, as part of their health care reform package, H.R. 3103.
A similar Senate bill, S. 1028, did not contain an MSA provision
so this issue must be worked out in a House-Senate conference
committee.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> MSAs empower families to make their own health
care decisions by choosing their own doctors and spending their
own money for such care.   MSAs are a bipartisan solution and
a practical free-market alternative to address the problems of
escalating health care costs and lack of portability between jobs.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>12. What is FRC's response to the homosexual 
agenda?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that homosexuality is unhealthy, immoral and destructive
to individuals, families and societies.  <I>Compassion</I> --
not bigotry -- impels us to support healing for homosexuals who
want to change their orientation.

<p>

FRC opposes any attempts to equate homosexuality with civil rights
or to compare it to benign characteristics such as skin color
or place of origin.

<p>

The Family Research Council opposes sex education programs that
treat homosexuality and heterosexuality as equally desirable,
that teach that any sexual behavior between consenting people
is a human right, and that idealize homosexuality and the homosexual
lifestyle.  FRC also opposes attempts to make the adoption of
children by homosexuals an accepted practice.

<p>

Much of the data used to support claims by homosexual activists
is flawed:  the debate has been clouded by faulty research and
surveys taken out of context.  FRC supports efforts to promote
public policy -- based on scholarly research -- that undergirds
traditional values and families, rather than attempts to provide
special treatment for homosexuals.  The Family Research Council
applauds the efforts of men and women who provide counseling and
support for people who wish to leave the homosexual lifestyle
and find fulfillment in a healthy lifestyle.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>13. What is FRC's position on the military's homosexual 
ban?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the military should enforce the law  [10 U.S.C.
&#167; 654] that denies military service to homosexuals.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Rewrite the Pentagon's inconsistent method of 
implementing regulations which ignore the law's intent to deny service to 
homosexuals. Additionally, reinstate the question asking if a candidate 
is a homosexual, which the law permits to be asked of all recruits.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> In 1993, Congress held hearings to determine
whether to keep the military's 200-year-old homosexual ban.  Experts
testified that homosexuals threaten unit cohesion and morale --
key combat components.  Their defining behavior is illegal in
the military, and as a category homosexuals create an unacceptable
health risk to themselves and others.  Science has found that
homosexuals experience higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases,
including the AIDS virus, and higher rates of drug abuse than
heterosexuals.

<p>

On November 30, 1993, President Clinton signed into law the military's
long-standing ban on homosexual military service.  The law [ 10
U.S.C. &#167; 654] Congress passed is very clear: no homosexuals
in the military.  But this binding expression of the will of the
American people has not stopped the Clinton administration from
creating regulatory loopholes through which homosexuals not only
serve, but serve openly in the military.  This end run around
Congress has not gone unnoticed.

<p>

This spring, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
in <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> identified the regulatory loopholes.
In this case, a homosexual sailor challenged both the law passed
by Congress and the Clinton administration regulations on homosexuals
in the military.  Six of that court's judges declared that the
administration deliberately mischaracterized the law and deliberately
shaded its answers to Congress when concerned members tried to
pin down exactly what the White House was up to in regard to 
&quot;implementing&quot; the law on homosexuals in the military.

<p>

Besides revising the regulations to be consistent with the law,
the services must also return to asking recruits about their sexual
orientation and past homosexual conduct. Asking the questions
kept honest homosexuals out and sent a clear message that to serve,
others must keep their homosexuality a secret.  In 1993, the Clinton
administration ordered this practice stopped.  The new law, however,
permits the Secretary of Defense to reinstate the questions. 
Asking new recruits and those reenlisting is a prudent step to
warn would-be service members that homosexuals are not eligible
for service in the military.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The law and the regulations are inconsistent.
This undercuts the constitutional authority of Congress to set
the rules and regulations for the military and puts the courts
in the position of having to force the executive branch to do
its constitutional duty to &quot;faithfully execute the laws&quot;
of the land.  Rewriting the regulations will result in the restoration
of a consistent policy that will survive constitutional challenge,
avert the manifold medical and morale-related problems occasioned
by the Clinton administration's social experimentation, and put
to rest an issue that has disrupted the clear and workable policy
that served the nation well for generations.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>14. What does FRC think can be done to restore the sanctity
of human life?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that society must acknowledge and restore the sanctity
of human life for those born and unborn.  Society must protect
innocent unborn children and mothers facing a crisis pregnancy
from government funding and promotion of abortion in the U.S.
and abroad, and protect the elderly from physician-assisted suicide
and euthanasia.  We can accomplish these goals through various
protective measures through all branches of government:  executive,
legislative, and judicial.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Enactment of specific pro-life legislation,
such as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and other measures
that protect unborn children from abortion, reduce the overall
number of abortions, and restrict taxpayer funding and sponsorship
of abortion.  Encouraging the President to appoint, and the Senate
to confirm, pro-family judges who believe that unborn children
have an inalienable right to life and deserve full legal protection.
Adopt a human life amendment to the Constitution.  Encourage
policies to restrict physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Thomas Jefferson said:  &quot;The
protection of human life and happiness, and not their destruction,
is the first and only legitimate object of good government.&quot;
However, the unborn child is not considered a &quot;person&quot;
according to seven members of the Supreme Court in the <I>Roe
v. Wade</I> decision (1973).  Since the legalization of abortion
through all nine months of pregnancy in 1973, there have been
more than 33 million abortions.  One-third of these were performed
on teenage girls.  Out-of-wedlock pregnancies, sexually-transmitted
diseases [particularly chlamydia, syphilis, human papillomarvirus
(HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)], and abortion rates
have all dramatically increased since that time.  Abortion is
never a healthy solution to a problem pregnancy.  To that end,
government and, principally, communities and churches, must encourage
and promote public policies and programs that reduce the demand
for, and total numbers of, abortions; promote adoption; promote
parental involvement; and offer practical assistance to teens
and women in a crisis situation.  Our tax dollars should never
fund or actively encourage abortions using taxpayer dollars or
fund organizations with pro-abortion policy goals or objectives.

<p>

Opinion polls consistently show that the majority of Americans
oppose most abortions.  A 1994 Gallup poll commissioned by CNN
and <I>USA Today</I> found that 65 percent of Americans believe
that abortion should either be &quot;illegal in all circumstances&quot;
or &quot;legal under certain circumstances.&quot;  A January 1995
CBS/<I>New York Times</I> poll found that 60 percent believe that
abortion should either &quot;not be permitted&quot; or have &quot;stricter
limits.&quot;

<p>

Specifically, the president should sign the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act, a bill that would limit a particularly horrible late-term
abortion method that is basically infanticide.  Congress should
adopt, and send to the states for ratification, a human life amendment
that applies the protection of the 14th Amendment to unborn children
and assures recognition of their fundamental, individual right
to life.  In addition, various government agencies, such as the
Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of
Health, Department of Education, State Department, and Agency
for International Development must not indirectly or directly
fund or encourage abortions, fund domestic or international organizations
that promote or perform abortion as a method of family planning,
fund &quot;comprehensive&quot; school-based health clinics, fund
or encourage abortion-related research on drugs like RU-486, or
promote or fund physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Promoting the sanctity of human life is vital
to maintaining a great nation and strong civil society.  We see
in alarming crime rates and shocking killings the inevitable result
of abortion cheapening human life.  Society and political parties
must recognize the value and inherent worth of each individual
person from the moment of conception to natural death.  Unborn
children, the infirm, the handicapped and the elderly must all
be protected.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>15. How does FRC view immigration reform?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the immigration laws should reflect this country's
heritage as a &quot;nation of immigrants&quot; while also placing
emphasis on fairness and orderly procedure, recognizing that regulation
is necessary to protect our national sovereignty.

<p>

<b>Actions Needed:</b> (1) Support measures which halt illegal
immigration, e.g., increasing border patrols, halting welfare
payments to illegal aliens, permanently denying readmission to
aliens who are caught illegally residing in the U.S., etc.  (2)
Support pro-family measures regarding legal immigration, e.g.,
reuniting nuclear families first before other family and work
categories, enforcing policies which hold U.S. citizens and residents
financially responsible for the family member(s) they &quot;sponsor&quot;
for entry into the U.S., deporting and permanently excluding aliens
who have been convicted of an aggravated felony, and providing
asylum to victims of religious persecution and/or coercive population
control policies.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Immigration reform is badly needed
in order to correct the unwise policies of the past (i.e., providing
amnesty to all illegal aliens) and to provide a framework to meet
present and future challenges, especially those which address
the ever-growing problem of illegal aliens crossing into the U.S.

<p>

The problem of illegal immigration must be addressed on the principles
of ensuring adherence to the law and administering justice.  The
United States must not reward illegal aliens whose first act in
this country is to break the law.  Thus, we support efforts to
halt illegal immigration by increasing border patrols, enforcing
the expedited deportation of illegal aliens, increasing criminal
penalties for those who create or distribute fraudulent identification
documents, and permanently denying readmission to aliens who are
found to illegally reside in the U.S., among others.

<p>

In terms of legal immigration, the United States should preserve
its policy of welcoming legal immigrants, acknowledging the fact
that we are a &quot;nation of immigrants.&quot;  However, in recent
years, public opinion has been antagonistic towards immigrants
-- both legal and illegal -- due to the influx of illegal immigrants
and the notion that legal immigrants are not &quot;paying their
own way&quot; once they enter the U.S.  Thus, we support policies
which help legal immigrants &quot;play by the rules,&quot; such
as deporting and permanently excluding aliens who are convicted
of felonies, and enforcing &quot;sponsorship&quot; policies which
hold U.S. family members financially responsible for those immigrants
they sponsor to enter the U.S.

<p>

Finally, the United States must preserve its commitment to refugees,
particularly those who are victims of religious persecution or
coercive population control policies.  We support current U.S.
policy which does not impose a numerical limit on refugees because
America needs the flexibility to respond appropriately to future
humanitarian crises and because refugees currently comprise only
about 8 percent of total immigration to the U.S. every year. 
Most important of all, the United States must maintain its tradition
of moral leadership, reminding other nations that adherence to
universally-recognized human rights matters.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The American people already want immigration reform.
Implementing wise immigration reform policies -- halting illegal
immigration and regulating legal immigration -- will be vital
in order to restore Americans' confidence in the immigration system
as well as in changing the current negative public perception
about immigrants as a whole.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>16. What is FRC's position on the Legal Services 
Corporation?</h2></center>

<p>

To protect American families and businesses from frivolous, damaging
litigation and to end the annual waste of millions in taxpayer
dollars, FRC believes that the Legal Services Corporation should
be defunded.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> The complete defunding of the Legal Services
Corporation.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The Legal Services Corporation
was founded in 1965 with the purpose of expanding welfare benefits
to the poor through test cases and impact litigation.  That and
much more occurred as the program was commandeered by left-wing
lawyers with anti-family agendas.

<p>

The family is the foundation of society, yet in case after case
LSC has attempted to make the individual, instead of the family,
the basic unit of welfare policy.  This goal undermines the family
by replacing parents (especially fathers) with welfare programs
and discouraging self-reliance in favor of federally-funded dependency.

<p>

Examples of legal services' hostility to the family are legion.
They include:

<p><ul>

<li>In 1994, the National Center for Youth Law, a major LSC grantee,
played a key role in overturning California's parental consent
law on abortion.

<p>

<li>In 1993, Karla and Leland Swenson were forced to sell their
home to fight the Idaho Legal Aid Society's effort to seek custody
of their adopted son for the sister of the boy's biological father.
Neither of the boy's biological parents was seeking custody.

<p>

<li>In 1995, Lehigh Valley Legal Services of Pennsylvania tried
to give a teenage rapist custody of a child he fathered by his
rape of a 13-year-old even though a psychologist concluded he
would endanger the child.

<p>

<li>Also in 1995, Legal Services of Greater Miami joined forces
with the ACLU and homosexual activists to fight for a homosexual
couple's bid to adopt a child.

</ul><p>

Congress has already called for LSC's phasing out by 1998, starting
with a 30 percent funding cut for fiscal 1996 from $400 million
to $283.5 million.  In addition, several restrictions have been
placed on LSC, prohibiting its grantees from filing class-action
lawsuits except with the approval of the Corporation.

<p>

Legal services lawyers will no longer be allowed to represent
prisoners, illegal aliens, and public housing residents being
evicted for drug-related crimes.

<p>

Unfortunately, restrictions can be circumvented.  Several grantees
have already set up new groups to receive LSC grants while using
non-federal or private grants to carry out continued assaults
on the family.  The inclusion of the Cohen amendment in the omnibus
spending bill was a victory for LSC.  It allows grantees to comment
on legislation as well as become involved in legislative rulemaking
-- a major loophole for legal services lawyers to engage in lobbying
activities.  As these incidents show, nothing short of the outright
abolition of LSC will solve the problem.

<p>

The private bar can and must assume responsibility for meeting
the needs of poor Americans for legal services not covered by
public defender programs across the United States.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Defunding the Legal Services Corporation will
provide protection to the American family, slow the expansion
of the welfare state, and cut federal spending by billions of
dollars over the long-term.  It will help get politically-motivated
&quot;public interest&quot; lawyers off Americans' backs and shift
power and money back to local governments -- and the American
people.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>17. What is FRC's opinion on the redefinition of 
marriage?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC opposes the radical redefinition of marriage and the erosion
of societal protections for marriage.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b>  Passage of the federal Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA), continued enactment of state laws that define marriage
as the union of one man and one woman, and resistance to the institution
of  &quot;domestic partnership&quot; benefits and privileges to
same-sex or unmarried couples.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b>  Because of its crucial role, marriage
has a special status within the culture and the law.  Its essence
-- the joining of one man and one woman in a uniquely exclusive
legal, sexual, economic and spiritual bond with the procreation
of children as a desirable and common result -- had not been seriously
challenged for thousands of years.

<p>

Now, homosexual activists are on the verge of radically redefining
marriage and family through judicial fiat.  If they succeed, all
distinctions based on sex will fall, and the worst aspects of
the rejected Equal Rights Amendment will be imposed.  Homosexuals
will gain the &quot;right&quot; to adopt children; schoolchildren
will be taught that homosexual sex is the equivalent of marital
love between husband and wife; employers will be forced to subsidize
homosexual relationships; churches will be pushed outside the
civil law; and government power will be directed against anyone
who believes that homosexuality is wrong.  Likewise, any government
institution of  &quot;domestic partnerships&quot; will harm the
moral order by raising homosexuality and fornication to protected
status, thereby undercutting societal support for marriage.

<p>

In August, a Hawaiian court is expected to strike down that state's
law limiting marriage to &quot;one man and one woman.&quot;  
Despite widespread opposition within Hawaii (recent polls show
that 74 percent of Hawaiians reject same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;)
homosexual activists hope to impose their agenda through compliant
courts.  Because the U.S. Constitution's Full Faith and Credit
Clause calls for states to honor each other's licenses, homosexuals
are planning to fly to Hawaii, &quot;marry,&quot; and return to
the mainland to claim &quot;married&quot; status.  More than 30
states now have efforts underway to protect marriage, and nine
-- Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Oklahoma,
South Dakota and Utah -- have enacted laws protecting marriage.

<p>

At the national level, DOMA would protect the military, Social
Security and all federal agencies from radical redefinition of
wedlock, as well as protect states from having their marriage
laws invalidated by an adverse court ruling or enactment in another
state.

<p>

The marriage battle is being fought while several key cases involving
the homosexual agenda are being decided.  The Supreme Court recently
struck down a voter-approved Colorado state constitutional amendment 
to bar any city or county from enacting special rights
based on sexual orientation.  Several cases challenging the military's
ban on homosexuality are being heard around the nation.  In Georgia,
a federal appeals court ruled in favor of a lesbian fired from
her job at the state attorney general's office after she announced
that she had  &quot;married&quot; her lover.  In New York, the
state's high court opened adoption proceedings to homosexual couples
and unmarried heterosexual couples, thus devaluing marriage and
jeopardizing children.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> If marriage is radically redefined, or domestic
partnerships instituted, the entire moral code will unravel. 
Polls show that the American people overwhelmingly expect public
officials to defend marriage unequivocally.  This effort can advance
the cause of judicial reform, halt the judicial assault on traditional
morality and stall the homosexual activist agenda, which has gone
far beyond mere &quot;tolerance.&quot;

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>18. What does FRC do to support military families?
</h2></center>

<p>

FRC created the Military Readiness Project (MRP) to oppose the
induction of homosexuals into the military because their known
presence destroys morale and personal privacy and introduces sexual
tension into the barracks.  FRC opposes attempts to subvert the
law barring anyone with homosexual &quot;propensities&quot; from
military service.  The MRP has been actively engaged in providing
&quot;friend of the court&quot; briefs in key federal court cases
dealing with this issue.

<p>

The Family Research Council believes in the unique gifts and capabilities
of women, and opposes the pitfalls of a military that is gender
blind.  Some combat exemptions have already been eliminated, but
if the erosion continues, women may be placed in direct combat
roles &quot;on the same terms as men,&quot; a position supported
by barely a quarter of the American people.  The country -- and
its women -- are not well-served by placing women in combat positions.
FRC has worked hard to maintain a combat exemption in today's
military.

<p>

FRC has also tackled the issue of pornographic materials sold
in taxpayer-supported military stores.  The Family Research Council
sees this practice as one that undermines military discipline
and is at odds with the fundamentals of leadership and service.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>19. How does FRC view the rights and responsibilities 
of parents?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the rights of parents to direct the upbringing
and education of their children without unwarranted interference
from the government should be protected.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Statutory recognition of the fundamental
right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their
children.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The past century has witnessed
a subtle shift in the role of child rearing from a private matter
to a matter of increasingly public concern.  At the turn of the
century, courts began to examine and uphold state compulsory education
laws; today, government bureaucrats display an arrogant &quot;we
know best&quot; attitude that manifests itself in such ways as
compulsory-attendance, value-free sex education classes for elementary
school children.

<p>

While the Constitution does not explicitly address the parent-child
relationship, the Supreme Court has historically regarded the
right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their
children as a fundamental right under the Fourteenth Amendment.
In the 1920s, the Supreme Court affirmed its high regard for
the integrity of the parent-child relationship in two landmark
cases:  <I>Meyer v. Nebraska</I> and <I>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</I>.
In <I>Meyer</I>, the Court stated that the liberty guaranteed
by the Fourteenth Amendment denotes &quot;the right of the individual
to marry, establish a home and bring up children.&quot;  The Court
declared in <I>Pierce</I> that the child is not a mere creature
of the state, and that &quot;those who nurture him and direct
his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize
and prepare him for additional obligations.&quot;

<p>

A new law is needed because although the Supreme Court's intent
to protect parental rights is unquestionable, lower courts have
not always followed the Supreme Court's strong mandate for the
parent-child relationship.  For example, parents from Falmouth,
Massachusetts recently lost a case in which they challenged their
school board's installation of condom machines in high school
bathrooms and school-nurse distribution of condoms to junior high
schoolers. Many public schools conduct psychological testing of
children under the guise of standardized &quot;tests&quot; and
&quot;surveys&quot; without parental consent.  Court challenges
to these policies have been met with mixed results.  Parents in Georgia
are fighting a legal battle against school administrators who
drove their daughters to a health clinic for gynecological tests
and birth control prescriptions without notification or consent.

<p>

The legal recognition of parental rights is also a children's
rights issue, because a child's first and most important right
is to have a parent who is in charge of raising him or her with
love and direction.  To say that parents have the primary role
in raising children is to say that parents are irreplaceable.
Stable, intact families rearing children with both love and direction
have never been in shorter supply or more desperately needed.
Parents need the legal standing to defend their fundamental right
to direct the upbringing and education of their children.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Statutory recognition of the fundamental right
of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children
would ensure that, when parents and government fight for the right
to make important decisions about child rearing, parents' preeminent
and unambiguous rights will prevail.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>20. What is FRC's opinion of pornography?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC strongly opposes pornography, especially child pornography.
Pornography has a corrupting influence on individuals, turns
natural desires into unnatural cravings, and reduces human beings
to anonymous tools for the stimulation and gratification of those
cravings.

<p>

Contrary to a widespread perception, pornography no longer consists,
if it ever did, primarily of soft air-brushed photos of smiling
young women in various states of undress, or of movies depicting
cheerful, consensual coupling.  Exploiting the phenomenon of customer
desensitization, today's pornographers have turned to themes such
as bondage, mutilation, torture, bestiality, and others.

<p>

Does pornography contribute to rape, battery, and child molestation?
Supporters of pornography say it does not, but the evidence suggests
otherwise:  studies have shown that exposure to pornography
leads to a generalized predisposition toward violent and sexual
acts.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>21. What does FRC think should be done to combat 
pornography?</h2></center>

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> (1) National standards for the determination
of obscenity should be developed.  (2) The law should require
compensation for the victims of pornography.  (3) Obscenity should
be treated as contraband.  (4) Strict liability should be the
legal standard for child-porn possession and distribution.  (5)
Computer networks should be family-friendly.  (6) Cable porn should
not be available on anything other than an opt-in basis.  (7)
All child porn should be made illegal:  pseudo, morphed, sketched,
or written.  (8) Indecency laws should be updated to include cable
and satellite transmission.  (9) Ordinary citizens should have
legal standing to seek injunctions against pornographers.  (10)
Pornography should be banned from U.S. government property, such
as on military bases both in America and abroad.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The policy steps listed above can
be taken to strengthen the hand of law enforcement against obscenity.
In 1970, the U.S. Postal Service identified 25 mail-order companies
across the country which sent unsolicited, sexually-explicit material
to homes across the country.  By March 1988, the number had grown
to 100 such companies.  Sex movies now make up more than 27 percent
of national video rental revenue.  Rentals and sales of adult
videos soared to $2.5 billion in 1994, and one analyst predicted
a 15 percent increase in that figure when 1995 figures become
available.

<p>

Pornography is also rampant on the worldwide computer system called
the Internet.  In June 1995, a team at Carnegie-Mellon University
released the results of a quantitative analysis of more than 900,000
items on the Internet.  The results:

<p><ul>

<li>83.5 percent of pictorial images available on Usenet newsgroups
devoted to images are pornographic;

<p>

<li>More than 48 percent of all &quot;downloads&quot; from 
&quot;adult&quot; commercial outlets are child porn;

<p>

<li>The two most-frequently-accessed picture categories on the 
&quot;adult&quot; market are child porn and bestiality.

</ul><p>

Dr. Dolf Zillman of Indiana
University, who has conducted research on attitudinal changes
caused by &quot;soft-core&quot; pornography, wrote, &quot;Whatever
the specific contents of standard pornography, there can be no
doubt that effects are created, and consistently so.  There can
be no doubt that pornography, as a form of particularly male entertainment,
promotes the victimization of women in particular.&quot;

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The enforcement of laws against obscenity and
the development of more legislation to protect our communities
from pornography in all its forms will result in a more family-friendly
world in which to raise children.  When parents and their children
enter the world of television, movies, radio, cyberspace, video
stores, and magazine shelves, the landscape will no longer resemble
fields of land mines.  Women will be protected, as will the institution
of marriage itself.  The deterioration of neighborhoods which
pornography brings will be reversed.  Incidents of date rape and
sexual harassment will be significantly reduced.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>22. What can be done to promote premarital sexual abstinence
and responsible sex education?</h2></center>

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> National and local acknowledgment of parents
as the primary sex educators of their children.  National and
local publicity for and support of grass-roots initiatives which
promote abstinence and secondary virginity, especially those which
are faith-based in their approach.  Local school boards that cooperate
with parents to determine which, if any, sex education curriculum
should be implemented.  Most importantly, parents that give special
attention to personally teaching their own children about sexual
abstinence.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> In recent years, encouraging premarital
abstinence has not been a national priority.  Rather, parents
have often had to single-handedly defend their values to their
children against the onslaught of media, school sex education
programs and school-based clinics, federal family planning initiatives,
and the rhetoric of national leaders which irresponsibly condone
out-of-wedlock sexual activity and attempt to separate premarital
sexual behavior from its inevitable and devastating consequences.

<p>

While there are many federal initiatives which promote &quot;family
planning&quot; and other types of sex education which undermine
the pre-marital sexual abstinence message (i.e., Title X of the
Public Health Service Act, the National Campaign to Prevent Teenage
Pregnancy, etc.), only Title XX of the Public Health Service Act
has devoted any monies and resources to promoting sexual abstinence.
Title XX funding has hovered around $6 million for several years
now, but only about one-third of these monies are dedicated to
abstinence education programs (as opposed to the nearly $200 million
appropriated for Title X alone).  More recently, $75 million was
appropriated for abstinence education in the welfare bill, but
President Clinton vetoed the measure.

<p>

While the Family Research Council supports measures that would
promote pre-marital sexual abstinence, FRC is firmly committed
to the principle that those who are best equipped to guide our
nation's children towards sexual abstinence and other moral and 
character values are their parents first and their community second. 
We believe that the proper role of the government and the media is 
to acknowledge the primary role of parents and to support their 
efforts.

<p>

Promoting premarital sexual abstinence makes good sense in a day
and age when out-of-wedlock pregnancies, illegitimacy, abortion,
and sexually-transmitted diseases are rampant, especially among
the young.  Not only does premarital abstinence help young people
to successfully avoid these physical and societal scourges, it
also increases the likelihood that they will experience an enduring
marriage, sexual satisfaction, and emotional and psychological
health.

<p>

For those young people who do not have the benefit of an intact,
two-parent home,  community programs which promote abstinence
are vitally important.  For example, the Washington, D.C.-based
<I>Best Friends</I> program has successfully helped more than
400 girls aged 10-18 to preserve their virginity and rise above
the teen motherhood and welfare dependency to which so many of
their peers have fallen victim.  In addition to <I>Best Friends</I>,
church-based initiatives such as <I>True Love Waits</I> and school-based
programs such as <I>Teen-Aid</I>, <I>Choosing the Best</I>, and
<I>Teen Choice</I> have all been effective in helping young people
make a commitment towards premarital sexual abstinence.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Enabling parents, churches, and communities to
promote and encourage pre-marital sexual abstinence will strengthen
the American family, especially in the long-term as today's abstinent
young people grow up to form healthy marriages and families. 
Promoting abstinence will also help reduce the incidence and prevalence
of sexually-transmitted diseases, out-of-wedlock pregnancies,
illegitimacy, and welfare-dependency.  Furthermore, the focus
on parents and grass-roots community activism away from government
directives will cost taxpayers less money and will result in better
outcomes for our nation's youth, families, and local communities.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>23. What is FRC's position on spousal benefits?</h2></center>

<p>

In an effort to help alleviate the financial burden on families
in which one spouse stays at home, and to recognize the important
contribution that non-employed spouses make to the income production
of employed spouses (an acknowledgment commonly made in divorce
settlements), FRC fully supports spousal benefits.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Legislation allowing expansion of IRA benefits
to non-employed spouses.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Complementing the attractive idea
of expanding the uses of IRAs to help free up family finances
(e.g., penalty-free withdrawals to cover major housing, education,
and health expenses) is the proposal to broaden the eligibility
of IRAs to include non-employed spouses.  While broadening the
eligibility of IRAs in general would primarily benefit upper-middle-
and upper-income taxpayers, a more targeted broadening of the
eligibility to non-employed spouses would provide relief primarily
to middle-income families with children -- those most in need
of pro-family tax relief.  Currently, two-earner couples can claim
almost twice the benefits of single-earner couples, penalizing
those families who choose to stay at home with their children
and ignoring the significant contribution the full-time homemaker
makes to the income production of the employed spouse.

<p>

The acknowledgment of the non-employed spouse as a contributor
to the income production of the employed spouse is one already
made in divorce settlements, and is an important principle for
Congress to reinforce.  For families with children, current IRA
benefits financially reinforce families where both parents work
outside the home, while penalizing those families who choose to
have one spouse stay at home to care for the children.

<p>

Legislation broadening IRA eligibility was passed in both the
House and Senate, but vetoed by President Clinton in the proposed
budget for 1996.  Passage of legislation to help level the playing
field for single-earner families is a key step to providing relief
to American families.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The passage of legislation increasing pro-family
spousal benefits is key to underscoring the importance of the
family and to providing tangible aid to middle-class American
families.  Broadening IRA benefits to non-employed spouses would
give hard-working middle-class families help, by providing savings
and income options for families where one parent stays home to
raise children.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>24. Does FRC support Title X of the Public Health Service
Act?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that defunding Title X is the first step in removing
the federal government's imprimatur on out-of-wedlock sex and
to halt its role in distributing contraception to minors without
parental consent.  Defunding Title X is justifiable and necessary
because the program has failed to achieve the goals of reducing
out-of-wedlock pregnancy and abortion.  Indeed, since the inception
of Title X, both the out-of-wedlock pregnancy and abortion rates
have increased dramatically.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b>  Zero out funding of Title X of the Public
Health Service Act.  If complete defunding is unsuccessful, support
efforts which cut funding of the program and/or insert &quot;strings&quot;
such as requiring parental notification or consent for any contraception
given to minors, or requiring outcome evaluations of clinics which
receive Title X funds to show their impact on pregnancy, STD,
and abortion rates among clinic &quot;clients.&quot;

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Title X of the Public Health Service
Act was enacted in 1970 as a grant program to fund family planning
projects throughout the country.  It has been funded by Congress
every year through the Labor/HHS Appropriations bills which Congress
considers and passes every summer as part of the federal budget.
The program helped to spawn the proliferation of family planning
clinics within states, granting federal sanction to the distribution
of contraception to unmarried women and to minors without parental
consent.  Title X received more than $193 million last year and should
be defunded altogether.

<p>

The reasons to defund Title X are numerous.  First of all, Title
X is a failed program.  Since the inception of Title X, out-of-wedlock
births, pregnancies, and abortions have all risen dramatically,
particularly in the populations Title X is supposed to have targeted.
Consider the teenage population alone.  Since 1970, the teenage
out-of-wedlock pregnancy and birth rates have doubled, the teenage
abortion rate has more than doubled, and many sexually-transmitted
diseases among teenagers have increased dramatically.  While not
all of this can be directly tied to Title X funding, it is certain
that the federal government's sanction for such programs has led
to an undermining of moral standards by accepting premarital sex
among teenagers as a cultural norm.

<p>

Secondly, Title X should not continue to receive federal funding
because it is an unauthorized program.  Its authorization expired
in 1985.

<p>

Third, Title X is duplicative.  Several other programs such as
Medicaid and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant provide
family planning to low-income and other targeted populations.
There is no clear basis for the federal government to run a categorical
family planning program when state governments have the capability
to set health care priorities within the parameters of an alternative
block grant.

<p>

Finally, Title X's contraceptive approach leaves many vulnerable
girls open to abuse.  New studies show that most teenage mothers
are not &quot;sexually active&quot; ingenues, but rather victims
of sexual exploitation by much older men.  Title X's contraceptive
approach does not protect these young girls, it only &quot;equips&quot;
them for continued abuse.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Defunding Title X will help to uphold the first
principle of the Hippocratic Oath to &quot;do no harm.&quot; 
It will place limits on the wrongheaded attempts of the government
to redefine family life and the social parameters regarding out-of-wedlock
sex.  It will also help to lessen the large monetary advantage
that so-called family planning programs have over abstinence programs,
which have demonstrated superior ability to promote healthy attitudes
and behaviors in the young.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>25. What is FRC's position on the United Nations' Convention
on the Rights of the Child?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child
poses threats to the institution of the family.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> No U.S. ratification of the U.N. Convention
on the Rights of the Child.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The United Nations was created
in 1945 in the shadow of the Second World War as an attempt by
the victorious democracies to establish an international body
to safeguard the peace and promote human rights.  The U.N. has
attempted to give voice to the common aspirations of the world's
people.  In the past two decades, however, the U.N. has expanded
its agenda in ways that pose direct threats to the traditional
family.

<p>

Among the most threatening is the U.N. Convention of the Rights
of the Child, which was approved by the U.N. General Assembly
in 1989.  One prominent theme from the Convention is the notion
that children ought to be protected from the power of their parents.
Several articles in the Convention grant children new rights
independent of their parents and families.  In the U.S. today,
children's rights are, in effect, held in trust by their parents.
Under the Convention, children would hold those rights themselves.
For example, Article 12 grants children &quot;the right to express
views freely in all matters.&quot;  Would Article 12 permit parents
to restrict their children from getting tattoos, or talking back
to authority figures?  Article 15 guarantees children the &quot;freedom
of association.&quot;  One can envision a law that prevents parents
from restricting a child's choice of friends.  Conceivably, Article
14's freedom of religion could prevent a parent from taking a
child to church when he would rather not go.  Under Article 13,
a child has the right &quot;to seek, receive, and impart information.&quot;
There are no exceptions to this right, not even for parents who
would like to keep pornography from their children.

<p>

The U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Madeleine Albright, signed the
treaty in 1995, and it will become law in this country if the
Senate ratifies it by a two-thirds vote.  The required vote in
the Senate does not seem likely now, because Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.), a strong opponent of the Convention, is chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must review it.
In fact, Sen. Helms has introduced a Senate Resolution which
expresses the sense of the Senate that &quot;the primary safeguard
for the well-being and protection of children is the family, and
that, because the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child could undermine the rights of the family, the President
should not sign and transmit it to the Senate.&quot;  Twenty-three
Senators have co-sponsored this resolution.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> As an international treaty, the U.N. Convention
on the Rights of the Child would be co-equal with federal statutes,
and possibly the United States Constitution.  If the United States
were to ratify the treaty as it stands, it would become not only
an international obligation, but also a domestic obligation potentially
regulating the most intimate details of American family life.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>26. Does FRC support the adoption of a $500 per child tax
credit for every American family with children?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC supports the adoption of a $500 per child tax credit for every
American family with children.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> FRC has been calling on Congress
to adopt pro-family tax relief for many years.  Today, the average
family of four contributes nearly 25 cents on every dollar in
income taxes and payroll taxes to the U.S. government -- this
is compared to two cents on every dollar in 1950.  In light of
this, the per child tax credit was designed to help offset the
extraordinary erosion in per child income tax benefits over the
last half-century.  Passage of significant pro-child tax relief
should be a top priority in the ensuing debate in Congress and
in the presidential debates.  The $500 per child tax credit was
vetoed by President Clinton as part of the balanced budget package.
FRC believes that per child tax relief should be the centerpiece
of any tax reform package.

<p>

Many critics and lukewarm supporters have expressed concern about
offsetting the revenues lost to such tax cuts.  In recent years,
the Heritage Foundation and others have developed ways to offset
generous pro-family tax relief with significant cuts in federal
spending programs.  These proposals have considerable merit --
as do proposals which would seek to offset the &quot;cost&quot;
of pro-family tax relief over the long haul by raising the retirement
age for various federal entitlement programs.

<p>

Streamlining government and permitting families to keep more of
their own income -- for things like dental appointments and clothing
purchases and electric bills -- benefits both the national economy
and the personal economy of families.  Immediate pro-family tax
relief should be a part of any government plan to balance the
budget and make government more efficient.  Of course, pro-family
tax relief also sends to families the message that their dedication
to their children is invaluable to America, as they are the next
generation of American citizens.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Tax relief for families with children will strengthen
the American home and its finances, place real limits on the growth
of government and its wrongheaded attempts to redirect family
life, and underscore that the best &quot;investment&quot; in children
is made by mothers and fathers who, indeed, &quot;know best.&quot;

<center><h2>27. Does FRC support welfare reform?  Why?</h2></center>

<p>

To control the damage caused by federal welfare programs that
promote family breakdown and crowd out more compassionate alternatives
at the grass-roots (including private, faith-based programs),
FRC supports compassionate welfare reform.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> End the entitlement status of all cash
benefits that reward irresponsible conduct, particularly benefits
that are contingent on the birth of a child outside marriage;
end the federal tax code's marriage penalty on low- and middle-income
taxpayers; end the federal role in welfare -- both funding and
programmatic responsibility -- to maximize states' flexibility
to experiment with anti-poverty efforts that impose behavioral
requirements; revise the tax code to encourage charitable giving.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The current welfare system encourages
family disintegration and discourages personal responsibility
by guaranteeing a right to cash benefits regardless of personal
conduct.  The bureaucratic arrangements that spring up to administer
those benefits, in turn, tend to crowd out the voluntary organizations
that provide the real help -- the help that changes lives.

<p>

The culture of welfare dependency has reduced a potentially proud
and independent people to passive clients.  The current system
sends the message not that they are equal to the inevitable challenges
of life, but that they are helpless -- a different, less capable
group of citizens than those who can and do live by the rules.
Welfare bureaucrats say, &quot;You can't do this.  Let us do
it for you.  And pay us to do it with your vote, year after year.&quot;
Current policy empowers the bureaucracy at the same time it destroys
individuals, and children are inheriting not only material poverty
but their parents' poverty of the spirit.

<p>

It is not enough to say that certain kinds of welfare reform will
cause suffering.  Policymakers must come to terms with the degree
of suffering that is occurring now.  No one can expect to roll
back the tide until more children are growing up with an attentive
father in the home.  The overriding purpose of welfare reform
<I>must</I> be to reverse government policies that suppress the
natural human instinct to form families.

<p>

Policymakers can disapprove of personal decisions that jeopardize
children and yet still provide help.  Measures like the tax credit
for charitable contributions deserve support because the most
compassionate help comes from private individuals and organizations
that sponsor moral renewal at the same time they offer material
support -- on the premise that needy individuals are not clients
but fellow human beings.  Welfare policy should in no way jeopardize
the autonomy of the faith-based programs that have a proven track
record of rescuing lives when all other programs have failed.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Compassionate welfare reform will ensure that
more children have the opportunity to reap the benefits of stable,
two-parent families.  It will expand the freedom of individuals
to make rational, responsible decisions by eliminating the perverse
economic incentives of the current welfare system.  It will also
redirect dollars to those organizations that provide not only
material help but also love, concern, and an opportunity for personal
renewal.

<center><h2>28. Does FRC support exemptions for women in 
combat?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC fully supports the armed forces exemption of women from combat
and near-combat assignments.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Re-impose combat exemptions for women and
reverse decisions to dramatically increase the number of women
serving.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> In the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, Congress rescinded female
combat exemption laws and then the Clinton administration opened
a quarter million previously closed combat and near-combat positions
to women.  These decisions were not prompted by military necessity,
and they hinder military readiness.

<p>

According to the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment
of Women in the Armed Forces, there are undeniable differences
in speed, strength and endurance between men and women.  Women
will always be in greater danger on the battlefield.  Women do
not have &quot;an equal opportunity to survive.&quot;  That's
why the most physically demanding combat assignments should go
to men.  Additionally, a downsizing military does not need women
when an ample pool of fully-qualified men is available.

<p>

Assigning women to combat also makes women vulnerable to a future
draft.  The 1948 Selective Service Act requires all 18-year-old
male citizens to register for a possible draft.  In the 1981 case
of <I>Rostker v. Goldberg</I>, the Supreme Court ruled that women
were excluded from selective service registration primarily because
the law exists to develop a pool of potential combat troops; women
at that time were not eligible for combat.  That argument is losing
credibility as more combat exemptions are being abandoned.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Removing exemptions for women weakens the military
and makes all women vulnerable to a future draft.

<p>

The military exists to perform the most physically demanding task
known to man: combat.  Removing exemptions so that more women
can serve in combat and near-combat is not a prudent readiness
decision.  It weakens America's combat power.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>29. What is FRC's position on informed consent for women's
reproductive health decisions?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that women have the right to be fully informed about
both immediate and future risks to their physical and emotional
health, especially with regards to induced abortion.

<p>

<b>Actions Needed:</b> (1) Require that all health care professionals,
especially counselors and practitioners working in family planning
clinics and public health departments, effectively communicate
to their patients or &quot;clients&quot; the risks involved in
abortion, e.g., the increased risk of breast cancer for women
who have abortions.  (2) Require that all abortion clinics (as
well as other medical facilities offering abortions) perform an
ultrasound exam on abortion-minded women in order to (a) confirm
pregnancy and (b) to educate the woman about what the abortion
procedure entails. (3) Require post-abortion counseling centers
or other physicians to be integrated within protocol in order
to achieve true informed consent.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> It is routine public health practice
that patients be informed of all their risks before undergoing
a medical procedure or receiving medication of any kind.  However,
while technology has rapidly advanced and more data have been
acquired in the field of women's reproductive health, the abortion
industry and family planning clinics have not been regulated to
the same degree as hospitals and other health care facilities.
As a result, it is dubious that women are truly receiving all
the information they need to make fully informed decisions about
their reproductive health.

<p>

For example, women are currently not advised of the possibility
that induced abortion increases their risk of breast cancer, especially
if they have borne no other children to full term.  And yet, there
are more than 20 epidemiologic studies spanning the last two decades
which show a link between abortion (induced or spontaneous) and
breast cancer.  Indeed, the prestigious <I>Journal of the National
Cancer Institute</I> published a 1994 study which found that women
who have had an abortion before age 18 are 150 percent more likely
to develop breast cancer.  Women who have had an abortion after
age 30 increase their risk of breast cancer by 110 percent, and,
regardless of age, abortion increases the risk of breast cancer
by 50 percent.  With approximately 1.5 million abortions taking
place in the United States every year, 40 percent of which are
repeat abortions, and with one in every nine American women developing
breast cancer in their lifetimes, it is remarkable and highly
unethical that women are not informed of such risks.

<p>

In addition, there is ample evidence to suggest that many women
undergoing abortion suffer from post-abortion grief or trauma.
Indeed, support groups such as Project Rachel and organizations
such as American Victims of Abortion exist because of the emotional
scars post-abortive women bear.  Yet women are not being informed
of their risk of experiencing post-abortion grief nor are referrals
to any of the aforementioned organizations being given as part
of the typical abortion clinic's protocol.

<p>

Furthermore, achieving true informed consent becomes even more
important as several abortion clinics are currently using new
experimental abortifacients, such as the off-label usage of the
anti-cancer drug methotrexate in combination with the prostaglandin
cytotec.  Neither of these drugs is approved for the use of abortion,
yet several abortionists are regularly offering these drugs to
their patients, even though there is little research available
to prove their safety or efficacy.

<p>

Beyond providing appropriate counseling regarding abortion's physical
and emotional risks, abortion clinics should also be required
to give each abortion-minded woman an ultrasound exam in order
to confirm pregnancy and better explain the abortion procedure
to the woman.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Achieving true informed consent will (1) require
abortion clinic counselors to devote more time to each counseling
session, (2) require abortion clinics to purchase ultrasound equipment
and employ staff who are knowledgeable in operating the ultrasound,
(3) require that the most up-to-date research on the safety and
efficacy of abortion techniques, the physical and emotional risks
involved with abortion, and information about post-abortion grief
organizations are available for all clients.  Abortion clinics
will also need to come under the jurisdiction of a medical regulatory
agency in order to make certain that they are adhering to the
standards of true informed consent outlined above.  While these
regulations will require providers of abortion to alter their
practices, the standards are absolutely necessary to achieve the
overriding goal of protecting women's health and giving women
all the information they need to make an informed choice.

<H2>Business Relations Department</h2>

<hr>
<p>
The primary mission of the Business Relations department is to educate and mobilize the business community -- entrepreneurs, corporate leaders, trade associations, and activists -- on behalf of the  free enterprise/limited government policy agenda.  The department has coordinated briefings for industry groups on the current status of health care reform, telecommunications deregulation, trade, budget and tax reform, and deregulation.  
<p>
	In addition to meeting and briefing corporate representatives, the Business Relations department is working with industry coalitions to advance our agenda; coordinating working group meetings on the flat tax and regulatory reform; creating a "Resource Bank of Business" by identifying businessmen willing to speak, write, and testify on behalf of free enterprise/limited government policies; coordinating the activities of  our <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/physc.html"><b>Physicians Council</b></a>; and launching a new <a href="#council"><b>Business Council</b></a> of the Heritage Foundation.
<p>
	In addition to smaller, informal briefings, we host Heritage's regular <b><i>Washington Policy Roundtable</i></b> meetings which bring Heritage experts, industry representatives, and policy makers together to discuss issues that are being debated on Capitol Hill.  <b><i>Roundtable</i></b> meetings this year have included:
<p>
<table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=10>

</table><p>


	Business Relations also launched two new fax publications this year to update and inform the business community.  Both are targeted to representatives in the corporate, public relations, legal, and association fields.  The <i>Business Bulletin</i> presents an occasional essay on topics of special interest to this community.  The first <i>Bulletin</i> on <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/bb596.html">"Corporate Responsibility"</a> was authored by Rebecca Lukens Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a> and timed for release just prior to the White House conference on corporate responsibility.  The second <i>Bulletin</i> highlights the Heritage publication on "<a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/bb696.html">How the Congress Won the Budget War</a>" and offers free copies of our new pocket-sized summary card on the paper.  <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/octbrcal.html"><i>This Month at Heritage</i></a> is a faxed monthly calendar previewing upcoming Heritage lectures and events for the business community.

<h3>Business Council</h3>
<p>
Heritage launched a Business Council, which will educate business executives, small business owners, and entrepreneurs about issues that directly affect them.  Our goal in establishing a Business Council of the Heritage Foundation is to identify a group of businessmen activists who, through their civic, business and community activities will help us leverage our own work on issues like tax and regulatory reform, health care, the federal budget, and education reform.
<p>
Members of the Council receive receive Heritage reports through the mail and by fax.  And serve as a source of information for Heritage experts on the impact government policies have on real people. 
 <p>
	If you are interested in joining the Business Council of The Heritage Foundation, please contact:  Bridgett Wagner, Director of Business Relations at 202/608-6050 or via email at <a href="mailto:wagnerb@heritage.org">wagnerb@heritage.org</a>.

<p>
<a name="flattax">
<h3>Flat Tax Transition Rules Working Group</h3>
<p>

	The Heritage Foundation and the Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation have conducted a series of meetings that address various aspects of making a successful transition to a fundamentally reformed tax system.  These meetings will result in "white papers" and recommendations on moving towards effective transition rules. Topics have included: Accumulated Depreciation; Interest Deductibility; Health Care and Employee Benefits; Border Adjustability and Foreign Taxation; and Charitable Contributions.  If you are interested in learning more about these meetings or being added to our mailing list, please contact Bridgett Wagner at (202) 546-4400 or via e-mail at <a href="mailto:wagnerb@heritage.org">wagnerb@heritage.org</a>.

<p><a name="regs">
<h3>Regulatory Reform Working Group</h3>
<p>

	The Heritage Foundation leads the way in promoting regulatory reform by bringing together Hill Staff, lobbyists, and regulatory reform experts to address the ways in which we can make regulatory reform become a reality.  Topics include "How to Win the Environmental Debate," as well as other business, health and safety regulations.

	The  Project on Federalism and the States, formerly the Governors' Forum, was established in 1993 to enhance the role of the chief executives and legislators of the fifty states in the public debate on issues of national importance.  The broad purpose of the Project is to help increase the voice of the states in Washington to ensure that their interests command greater attention from officials in the federal government.
<P>
	The  Project on Federalism and the States is committed to restoring a balance between federal and state responsibilities through a reinvigoration of federalism.  The transfer of power from the states to Washington over the past decades has reached an unprecedented level, with virtually no area of public policy free from directives from Washington.  As the authority of state and local governments has declined, their ability to protect the interests of their constituents has continued to erode.  With decision-making on most major issues now firmly centered in Washington, state and local governments and their constituents are subjected to an ever-expanding list of mandates, regulations, and financial burdens which take little or no account of the differences between the states or of the wishes of their electorates.
<P>
	The  Project on Federalism and the States provides a platform in Washington for governors, state legislators, attorneys general, and other state and local officials to articulate directly to the Congress their positions on issues such as welfare reform, crime, education, and unfunded federal mandates on the states.   The Project highlights public policy innovations occurring outside Washington DC  through activities such as gubernatorial lectures, press conferences, position papers and editorials on key issues affecting the states, and extensive networking with national, state, and local media.

<title>Building A Better U.S. Partnership With Australia - Heritage</title>

<h3>BUILDING A BETTER U.S. PARTNERSHIP WITH AUSTRALIA</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert P. O'Quinn</a><br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Asian Studies Center Backgrounder No. 143<br>
October 30,  1996<br>
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Asia-Pacific region is becoming increasingly important to the United States. In 1995, U.S. two-way merchandise trade with the Asia-Pacific region rose to $503 billion, 38 percent of America's global two-way merchandise trade. Despite such economic intensity, however, Asia-Pacific trade remains susceptible to political upheaval that could endanger American security. The People's Republic of China is building a large military which could be used to enforce its territorial claims on the Spratly Islands and Taiwan. North Korea simultaneously poses the threats of military aggression and internal collapse. In Southeast Asia, Cambodia and Myanmar continue to repress their citizens.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To protect its economic and security interests in the Asia-Pacific region, America needs partners. The U.S. already has a number of defense partners in Asia; but some, like Japan, are not very good at liberalizing trade and other commercial activities in the region. Australia, however, in addition to being a military ally, could function effectively in helping to advance America's interest in liberalizing trade in Asia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Australia became a major player in the Asia-Pacific region only recently. For most of this century, the government in Canberra purposely developed a strong Western cultural and economic identity; but its protectionist policies also brought the country to the edge of economic ruin by the 1980s. Following the Labor Party's victory in the March 1983 elections, Prime Minister Bob Hawke began to deregulate the economy and dismantle protectionist trade barriers. Over the next decade, Australia was transformed from the developed world's second most protected economy into a leading proponent of free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Under Hawke, Australia embraced the Asian market, welcomed Asian immigration, and reoriented Canberra's diplomatic and economic ties away from Europe and toward Asia and the United States. The result has been economic vitality, and newly elected Prime Minister John Howard is continuing these successful policies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, Canberra has developed especially close relations with countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).<sup>1</sup>  As an outside superpower, the U.S. cannot easily duplicate the diplomatic, economic, and military ties that proximity and dedication have presented to Australia. By cooperating with Canberra on trade and security issues, Washington can benefit from Australia's unique relations with other Asian countries to secure vital American interests in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, however, the U.S.-Australian relationship is not living up to its potential. While Canberra and Washington are cooperating more closely on defense matters,<sup>2</sup> the U.S. often pursues counterproductive agriculture and trade policies that cost Americans and Australians dearly. For example, President Bill Clinton's vacillating trade policy is undermining Canberra's hopes for trade liberalization at the upcoming meetings of APEC ministers in the Philippines on November 22-25 and of the WTO in Singapore on December 9-12. The U.S. should be working with, not against, Australia to make these meetings a success for free trade.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Improving relations with Australia will help the U.S. better protect its interests in the caldron of economic opportunity and geopolitical danger that is Asia. To accomplish this goal, the President should:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Ask Congress to eliminate the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs</b> that together cost American consumers and taxpayers more than $10 billion every year.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress to allow intracoastal shipping to use foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels.</b> The current Jones Act requirement that intracoastal shipping use U.S.-built, U.S.-operated, and U.S.-owned vessels adds between $3 billion to $10 billion annually to the logistics costs of American firms.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress for fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues.</b> Fast track is needed to bring Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to present a substantive action plan for trade and investment liberalization in APEC, and to participate in any future round of WTO negotiations.
<p>
<li><b> Support Australia's initiative to harmonize such existing free trade agreements</b> as the North American Free Trade Agreement, Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Agreement (CER), and ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) within APEC. This would enhance the prospects for expanding liberalization within APEC itself.
<p>
<li><b> Participate fully in APEC's "concerted unilateralism" process.</b> Under concerted unilateralism, each APEC member prepares its own action plan to liberalize trade and investment, with each plan then subject to peer review to help assure compliance in achieving the ultimate goal. At present, there still are too many differences among APEC members for formal trade negotiations to succeed. Concerted unilateralism allows APEC members to take small but concrete steps each year toward APEC's ultimate goal of free trade and investment by 2020. Only if members gain confidence in each other can a more formal negotiating process be successful.
<p>
<li><b> Work with Australia to complete unfinished items from the Uruguay Round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).</b> These include sector agreements to liberalize trade in basic telecommunications and maritime transport, and new negotiations to liberalize agricultural trade.
<p>
<li><b> Propose convening a new WTO round with the goal of achieving a global free trade and investment agreement by 2020.</b>
<p>
<li><b> Enhance American military ties to Australia by offering to sell Canberra Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles and by including Canberra in the development any future Asian missile defense network.</b>

<b>AUSTRALIA: A RISING POWER IN ASIA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is easy for Americans to overlook Australia when thinking about Asian countries. Both stable and prosperous, Australia demands little attention from the crisis-dependent U.S. media. Moreover, most Americans do not really think of Australia as an Asian country. Unlike Asian countries with exotic cultures and languages, Australia and the U.S. share a common culture and language. It can be argued that Australia is more like the U.S. than any other country in the world.
</td></tr>But to overlook Australia when examining the Asia-Pacific region is a serious omission. There are four reasons for drawing this conclusion:
<p><blockquote>
<b>REASON #1: Australia is a major market for American goods and services</b>, with a large and vibrant economy. For example:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) in 1995 was $347.6 billion, making Australia's economy the fourth-largest in Asia and the 14th-largest in the world.</b> Despite Australia's relatively small population of 18 million, its GDP is larger than that of India, Taiwan, or any Southeast Asian country. Only China, Japan, and South Korea have larger economies.
<p>
<li><b> Australia is the world's 21st-largest trading power and America's 20th-largest trading partner.</b> Merchandise trade between Australia and the U.S. was $13.4 billion in 1995. In fact, the U.S. enjoyed a $7.5 billion merchandise trade surplus with Australia -- the largest such U.S. surplus with any of the world's trading powers.
<p>
<li><b> Australia hosts American direct investments of $24.7 billion.</b> Australia is the ninth-largest host to U.S. direct investment in the world and the second-largest in Asia, ranking only behind Japan.
<p>
<li><b> Trade and investment liberalization has expanded U.S. exports to Australia significantly in recent years.</b> U.S. merchandise exports to Australia have grown by 94 percent, from $5.5 billion in 1986 to $10.8 billion in 1995, and currently provide jobs to approximately 215,000 American workers. Under Canberra's liberal economic policy (especially its policy of privatization), U.S. direct investment in Australia has exploded by 165 percent, rising from $9.3 billion in 1986 to $24.7 billion in 1995.
</ul><p>
<b>REASON #2: Australia is a major proponent of free trade and investment.</b> For example:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Australia led the fight to include agricultural trade liberalization in the Uruguay Round Agreements.</b> In 1986, Australia organized the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural exporting countries to promote free trade in farm products.<sup>3</sup>  Under Australian leadership, the Cairns Group succeeded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in winning the first multilateral agreement to liberalize trade in agricultural products. Along with Brazil, the European Union, Japan, and the U.S., Australia is widely considered to be one of the five most influential members of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
<p>
<li><b> Australia founded the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</b> In January 1989, Prime Minister Bob Hawke proposed a meeting of government ministers from the Asia-Pacific region to establish a framework for economic cooperation. This led to the formation of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Canberra in November 1989.<sup>4</sup>  In November 1994, at Bogor, Indonesia, Australia and the other APEC member economies established the goal of "achieving free and open trade and investment" by 2010 for developed economies and by 2020 for developing economies.
<p>
<li><b> Australia and New Zealand were the first countries to outlaw antidumping procedures in a free trade agreement.</b> In 1988, Australia and New Zealand agreed to revise the original Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (CER) to make it the world's most comprehensive trade agreement. The CER removed all tariffs and quotas on trade in goods by 1990, established free trade in services, abolished antidumping procedures in bilateral trade, created a common labor market, and harmonized business and trade practices laws. As tariffs have fallen, protectionists in the U.S. and elsewhere increasingly have been employing antidumping procedures to curb imports. By abolishing antidumping procedures, the CER prevents such abuses.
<p>
<li><b> Unlike the U.S., Australia has lowered its trade barriers unilaterally.</b> In May 1988, Australia announced that tariffs on most manufactured goods would be lowered from 15 percent to 10 percent by July 1992. In March 1991, it announced that tariffs on most manufactured goods would be reduced further to 5 percent by July 1996, and that tariffs on textiles, clothing, and footwear would be reduced from 55 percent to 25 percent by July 2000.

</table>
<p>
<b>REASON #3: Australia is a strong military ally.</b> Australia is one of America's most steadfast military allies. Australian and American troops fought together in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War. Australia and the U.S. also are parties to a mutual defense treaty: the Australia, New Zealand, and United States Security Treaty, commonly known as ANZUS.<sup>5</sup>  Australia and Japan are among America's major military allies in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Moreover, the Howard government recently has shown its willingness to enhance cooperation with the United States on defense and regional security issues. On July 26, 1996, Canberra agreed to host a new series of biennial military exercises called "Tandem Thrust."  The first war game in March 1997 will involve 17,000 U.S. Marines and 5,000 Australian troops near Shoalwater Bay in Queensland. Subsequent American military training exercises will occur in the Northern Territory of Australia. Because of this cooperation, the U.S. can shift much of its Asian battle training away from densely populated Japan and Korea to sparsely populated areas of Australia (and possibly help to defuse local political tensions over American bases in Japan and Korea as well).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Canberra and Washington also have agreed to cooperate on missile defense issues. China is modernizing its missile forces and twice in the last year has used its missiles to threaten democratic Taiwan. During a July 1996 meeting in Canberra, Australian Minister of Defense Ian McLachlan and U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry signed a new ten-year lease that will allow the U.S. to use a jointly manned intelligence facility at Pine Gap. The functions of this base will expand to include intelligence satellite downlinks now at the Nurrungar, Australia, facility, which soon will be closed. The Nurrungar facility enabled the U.S. Space Command to help Patriot missile operators defeat Iraqi Scud missiles during the Persian Gulf War, and Pine Gap could help the U.S. provide defense support that Israel can use to defeat missile threats. Such capabilities also could help Australia defend itself from missile threats.<sup>6</sup>  Australia is in an ideal position to facilitate regional missile defense cooperation, and the facilities at Pine Gap could be expanded to provide intelligence information that might help the United States verify a future arms control agreement to limit the number of missiles deployed by Asian countries.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
<b>REASON #4: Australia maintains close diplomatic ties to Asia.</b> Australia can influence economic policymakers in Asian countries in ways the U.S. cannot. Canberra originated the concept of a regional economic forum that led to the formation of APEC in 1989. It also worked closely with President Suharto of Indonesia to persuade more reluctant APEC members to agree to the 1994 Bogor Declaration, which set as APEC's objective "achieving free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific by 2010 for developed economies and 2020 for developing economies."  Australia's successful trade liberalization encouraged the ASEAN countries to create their own ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) in January 1992 and to reduce the period for its implementation from 15 to ten years in October 1995. Canberra's cooperative attitude toward trade with Asia has increased Australian influence in Asian capitals. For example, the Howard government is working closely with ASEAN leaders to coordinate strategy in APEC and the WTO.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>HOW AUSTRALIA TRANSFORMED ITS WORLD PRESENCE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This remarkable new role for Australia has not occurred overnight. It is the result of a long transformation with deep roots in Australian history.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite Australia's proximity to Asia, for most of its history it has thought of itself as a European country. Because of this self-conception, Australian governments pursued policies known collectively as the "Australian Settlement."  Among other things, the Australian Settlement encompassed a "whites only" immigration policy, dependence on the United Kingdom for defense and markets, and a highly protected and regulated domestic economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Throughout most of this century, Canberra tried to promote industrial development through a system of high tariffs and subsidies to Australian manufacturers. But this protectionism caused a protracted decline in Australia's economy relative to the economies of other developed countries. In 1900, Australia had the highest per capita gross domestic product in the world. Over the next 80 years, it experienced the slowest growth in per capita GDP of all developed countries. By 1980, Australia had fallen to 14th place in per capita GDP.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During the 1970s, Australia's defense and trade ties to Great Britain diminished. The United Kingdom's accession to the European Union in 1973 denied Australia preferential access to its historically most important export market. Meanwhile, the economic rise of Japan and the other "Asian tigers" provided Australia with vast new markets for its agricultural and mineral products. The integration of separate national economies into a single global economy made Australia's inward-looking economic policies increasingly burdensome.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thus began a gradual backing away from the Australian Settlement policies. In 1973, Prime Minister Geoff Whitlam ended the "whites only" immigration policy. The result was significant Asian immigration, which caused Canberra slowly to begin to see itself more as an Asian country. Asian immigrants, with their cultural knowledge and language skills, have become a major asset for Australian firms doing business in Asia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, the decisive break with the Australian Settlement came in March 1983. Suffocating from double-digit inflation and unemployment rates, Australian voters elected a Labor Government led by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Treasurer Paul Keating. Contrary to what people normally expected of a Labor government, Hawke and Keating, driven by fear of an economic crisis, began to liberalize Australia's economy. Keating himself best summarized the challenges facing Australia:
<p>
<blockquote>
	We must let Australians know truthfully, honestly, earnestly, just what sort of international hole Australia is in.... If this government cannot get... a sensible economic policy, then Australia is basically done for. We will end up being just a third rate economy....  Then you are gone. You are a banana republic.<sup>8</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Hawke and Keating boldly rejected Australia's traditional policy of protectionism. The Labor government exposed Australia's domestic economy to global market forces through deregulation, privatization, and trade liberalization. The Hawke (1983-1991) and subsequent Keating (1991-1996) governments reoriented Australia's trade policies toward Asia, and Australia began to think of itself as an Asian country. Labor sought to broaden and deepen Australia's diplomatic and economic ties to China, Japan, South Korea, the countries of Southeast Asia, and the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These policies have made Australia a major player in the Asia-Pacific economy. Japan is now Australia's largest trading partner (receiving 24.3 percent of total Australian exports in 1994-1995), followed by South Korea (7.9 percent), New Zealand (7.1 percent), and the United States (6.9 percent). Australia annually hosts 43,000 foreign students (mainly Asian) in its universities, earning more than $1 billion annually in service export income.
<p>
<b>THE LEGACY OF U.S. POLICY: NEGLECT AND ABUSE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite Australia's growing importance in Asia, U.S. policy toward Australia is best described as benign neglect punctuated with occasional abuse -- even though Australia and the United States are long-standing allies with shared interests in commercial and military travel on oceans and seas, promoting access by American and Australian firms to domestic markets in Asia, and preventing the domination of Asia by a hostile power.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, it is undeniable that the U.S. has pursued agriculture and trade policies that have soured its relations with this emerging power. This may not have been intentional; American leaders simply did not pay adequate attention to the effects their decisions had on Australia. But the consequence has been undeniable: a missed opportunity to advance mutual economic interests in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>U.S. Agriculture Policy: A Losing Proposition.</b> Over the past decade, the most serious dispute between Australia and the United States has been over agriculture policy. American and Australian farmers produce a wide range of agricultural commodities that compete with each other on world markets. Because of America's role as a large, if not dominant, producer and consumer of many farm commodities, U.S. agriculture policy profoundly affects world agricultural markets. Therefore, the level of agricultural protection and subsidies that Washington gives its farmers not only determines U.S. food production, consumption, and trade patterns, but also sets world prices for major agricultural commodities.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By contrast, Australian farmers receive world prices for most of their agricultural products.<sup>10</sup>  Thus, to the extent that U.S. agricultural subsidies distort world prices, Australian farmers are affected adversely by U.S. agricultural policy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This problem was particularly serious in the 1980s when falling commodity and land prices caused agriculture subsidy costs to soar both in Australia and in the United States. Prime Minister Hawke and President Ronald Reagan chose radically different responses to this farm crisis. Hawke initiated a phaseout of Australia's agriculture price supports and subsidies. With the exception of its dairy industry subsidy (which will have been phased out completely in 2000), Australia now limits government agriculture assistance to inspection, quarantine efforts, pest control, education, and research.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By contrast, President Reagan created new export subsidies to improve the price competitiveness of American farm exports. Through the Food Security Act of 1985, the Reagan Administration established the Export Enhancement Program and the Dairy Export Incentive Program to subsidize U.S. agricultural exports. President George Bush later expanded these programs through the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the years since 1990, the attitude of American farmers toward federal agriculture programs has changed. Convinced in part by the successful transition of Australian farmers to subsidy-free agriculture, many American farmers have realized that they would be better off producing for the market instead of relying on government subsidy programs. When Congress began considering the reauthorization of federal agriculture programs in 1995, a revolution in American farm policy was at hand. The result was passage of the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996. In addition to granting wheat, feed grain, rice, and cotton farmers fixed but declining subsidies through seven-year transition contracts, the FAIR Act terminates production controls on wheat, feed grains, rice, and cotton. While the Act made progress toward a free market in agriculture, however, the dairy and sugar programs were modified only slightly, and the export subsidy programs were left intact. Thus, many subsidies remain. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Dairy Program.</b> The U.S. government maintains high domestic prices for dairy products through a complex and interlocking system of support prices, milk marketing orders, and tariff rate quotas. This system severely restricts access to the American market by foreign competitors such as Australia.<sup>11</sup>  The dairy program costs American consumers approximately $9 billion annually through high prices for milk, butter, and cheese, and American taxpayers will pay another $1.6 billion to maintain this program over the next five years.
<p>
<li><b>The Dairy Export Incentive Program.</b> The Dairy Export Incentive Program provides subsidies to exporters of dairy products.<sup>12</sup>  In addition to the fact that it will cost taxpayers approximately $120 million over the next five years without increasing the American dairy industry's international competitiveness, the Dairy Export Incentive Program depresses world dairy prices and reduces Australian dairy exports to third country markets.
<p>
<li><b>The Export Enhancement Program.</b> The Export Enhancement Program has paid out more than $6 billion since 1986, mainly to assist wheat exports. Intended to make American grain more competitive abroad, the Export Enhancement Program is counterproductive. U.S. export subsidies depress world grain prices (to the obvious objection of Australian farmers) while raising domestic U.S. grain prices, thereby discouraging American farmers from exporting.
<p>
<li><b>The Sugar Program.</b> The U.S. government maintains a high domestic price for sugar through a system of import tariff rate quotas.<sup>13</sup>  In 1993, the U.S. General Accounting Office concluded that the sugar program hiked the domestic price of sugar to twice the world level and cost American consumers $1.4 billion a year. Higher U.S. prices caused sugar's share of the domestic sweetener market to fall from 79 percent in 1981 to 55 percent in 1994, forcing American sugar refiners to close processing facilities. Higher domestic prices also have driven American candy companies to move confectionery plants overseas to obtain cheaper sugar. At the same time, the sugar program has reduced world prices by an average of 4.8 cents per pound and caused Australia to export 89 percent less sugar to the U.S. since 1981. Thus, this program costs Australian exporters $274 million annually.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>The Jones Act: A Burden on the American Economy.</b> Another burden on both the U.S. and Australian economies is the Jones Act. Contained in Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, this law restricts maritime commerce between points within the United States to ships that are American-built, American-operated, and American-owned. In September 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission found that the Jones Act adds from $3 billion to $10 billion annually to the logistics costs borne by American business firms.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Jones Act also is a major irritant in relations with Australia. Canberra complains that this law prevents the sale of competitively priced Australian-made high-speed vessels to U.S. firms. On a broader scale, the Jones Act is an impediment to reaching an agreement in the WTO on liberalizing trade in maritime services. It prevents the President from opening intracoastal shipping to foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels. Because the U.S. refuses to liberalize its maritime industry in areas in which foreigners are competitive, many other countries are unwilling to liberalize their maritime industries in areas, such as logistics and port management, in which Americans are competitive. As a result, WTO negotiations on liberalizing maritime services have stalled.

<P>
<b>THE IMPACT OF U.S. PROTECTIONISM ON RELATIONS WITH AUSTRALIA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While Australia has opened its economy, protectionist voices in the U.S. are urging Americans to shield themselves from the global economy. President Clinton's trade policy has been a series of mixed signals which have caused anxiety and confusion in Canberra. On the one hand, Clinton supported both the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993 and the Uruguay Round Agreements in 1994. He also signed the FAIR Act in 1996 to dismantle some protectionist and trade-distorting U.S. agriculture programs. On the other hand, however, Clinton appears to have strayed from his support of free trade in a number of different areas. For example, the President has:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b> Blocked an agreement with Congress to reauthorize fast-track negotiating authority for trade agreements.</b> President Clinton let fast-track authority for negotiating new trade and investment liberalization agreements expire in 1994. Under fast-track authority, trade and investment agreements negotiated by the President are submitted to Congress for a straight up-or-down vote; Congress may not amend any portion of a proposed agreement before voting on it. For two years now, the Clinton Administration has insisted that any bill reauthorizing fast track must allow the President to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This position has caused fast track to stall in Congress. Republican leaders fear that environmental and labor rules in trade agreements could be misused to protect certain industries. Republicans in Congress therefore offered to pass a "clean" fast-track bill without the authority to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues, but the Administration rejected this approach. Without fast-track authority, no country will enter into serious trade and investment liberalization negotiations with the U.S.<sup>14</sup>  The result: Canberra fears that the failure to pass fast track will stall progress on trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
<li><b> Pushed for managed trade.</b> The Clinton Administration attempted to impose managed trade policies on Japan in the automotive parts and motor vehicles dispute of 1995 and with respect to semiconductors in 1996. This strategy alarmed Canberra. Although Tokyo and Washington ultimately reached agreements in 1995 and 1996, respectively, which avoided mandatory quotas, Clinton's approach to the conflict alienated Australia and other Asian countries. The result: American influence over the direction of trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region has been diminished.
<p>
<li><b> Shown ambivalence toward the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</b> Canberra is happy that President Clinton embraced Australia's APEC initiative and hosted the first APEC Leaders' Meeting near Seattle in 1993. It also is pleased that in 1994 the United States agreed to create a free trade and investment area in the Asia-Pacific by the year 2020. President Clinton and the other APEC leaders adopted a process known as concerted unilateralism to achieve the goal of a free trade and investment area in this region. Under this process, instead of negotiating a formal trade agreement like NAFTA, each member proposes its own action plan for realizing the common goal of free trade prior to the 1996 APEC meetings; each action plan is then subject to peer review to help assure that all will work toward the ultimate goal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nevertheless, President Clinton's actions in the last two years have caused Canberra to question America's commitment to the APEC process. First, President Clinton skipped the 1995 APEC Leaders' Meeting in Osaka, Japan, because of the budget stalemate with Congress. This decision disappointed Australia's Prime Minister at the time, Paul Keating, and raised questions among other leaders in the region. Second, the Clinton Administration has yet to offer a substantive U.S. action plan for APEC liberalization; its proposed plan is confined merely to a list of liberalization commitments previously made in the Uruguay Round Agreements. Canberra fears that the Clinton Administration's failure to offer anything new will discourage other APEC members from making substantive trade liberalization commitments.
<p>
<li><b> Failed to keep its commitment to liberalize trade in the WTO.</b> One of the Uruguay Round Agreements, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), established a general framework for liberalizing trade in various services in 1994. It also established a timetable for reaching specific agreements covering the financial services, telecommunications, and maritime transport sectors.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration backed away from its WTO commitments in 1995 and 1996. Claiming that India, Japan, Korea, and certain ASEAN countries had not made adequate offers to open their financial services markets, the Administration unexpectedly withdrew from the WTO negotiations to liberalize financial services markets on June 29, 1995, the day before the agreement was to be completed. When Australia and the European Union were unsuccessful in persuading the Clinton Administration to return to the bargaining table, they joined with other WTO members and signed a two-year interim financial services agreement excluding the United States. For the first time, a multilateral trade agreement was reached without U.S. consent. This demonstrates President Clinton's declining influence over the course of world trade liberalization.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While GATS established rules to be used in opening markets for certain telecommunications products such as electronic mail, voice mail, on-line information and data base retrieval, and electronic data interchange, Uruguay Round negotiators were unable to fashion rules covering such other basic products as long distance and international services. Therefore, the WTO continued the negotiations on trade liberalization in these basic services. Once again, claiming that offers from India and the ASEAN countries were inadequate, the Clinton Administration withdrew American support for a WTO telecommunications agreement on April 30, 1996, the day negotiations were scheduled to conclude. When Australia and the European Union failed to broker a compromise, the WTO extended its negotiating deadline to February 15, 1997.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Howard government interprets this failure to reach sector agreements as evidence of President Clinton's unwillingness to subordinate the special interests of certain American firms to the general benefits of trade liberalization. At the same time, Canberra feels that Clinton Administration policies are fueling deep division within the WTO by attempting to link trade with issues related to environmental and labor standards. Australia and other Asian countries see this as nothing but thinly veiled protectionism and a brake on global trade liberalization. Not only has the Clinton Administration once again alienated potential allies (as it did in APEC), but it may have forfeited America's leadership role in the upcoming December 9-12, 1996, WTO Ministerial Meeting in Singapore as well.
<p>
<b>BUILDING A STRONGER U.S.-AUSTRALIA RELATIONSHIP</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite Australia's growing economic and geopolitical importance in the Asia-Pacific region, President Clinton continues to ignore Canberra. His agriculture and trade policies have hurt Australia needlessly. Moreover, the Clinton Administration's opposition to renewing fast-track authority, its campaign for managed trade with Japan, and its vacillation regarding APEC and the WTO have raised doubts in the Howard government about America's commitment to free trade.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These policies must be changed if the United States is to build a stronger relationship with Australia. Australia has changed greatly over the last decade. While maintaining its defense ties to the United States, it has developed closer diplomatic and economic ties to its neighbors in East and Southeast Asia and stands today as a leading advocate of free trade and investment. This new approach creates new avenues for cooperation between the U.S. and Australia. To facilitate this relationship and to enhance U.S. security and economic interests in Asia, there are several important steps that the Administration and Congress can take. Specifically, the President should:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ask Congress to terminate the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs.</b> With passage of the FAIR Act, the U.S. began to wind down many economically irrational programs. However, the Dairy Program, Dairy Export Incentive Program, Export Enhancement Program, and Sugar Program survive largely intact. These programs raise U.S. consumer prices, cost American taxpayers billions of dollars annually, and decrease world prices for agricultural commodities. Eliminating them would remove a major impediment to improved U.S.-Australia relations and strengthen both economies.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress to allow intracoastal shipping to use foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels.</b> Repealing the Jones Act would help both the U.S. and Australia by allowing the use of competitively priced, Australian-made high-speed ships in U.S. waters. The result would be to lower logistics costs for American business firms and consumers.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress for fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues.</b> The U.S. needs fast-track authority to offer a substantive action plan for trade and investment liberalization at APEC, to harmonize NAFTA with other regional free trade agreements, and to commence a new round of WTO negotiations. The President should drop his insistence that authority to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues must be included in any fast-track legislation. Environmental and labor standards issues may have an international dimension, but they should be addressed in separate negotiations on their own merits.
<p>
<li><b>Support Australia's initiative to harmonize existing free trade agreements within APEC.</b> At upcoming APEC meetings, Canberra will urge members to harmonize existing free trade agreements such as NAFTA, the CER, and the ASEAN Free Trade Area. The President should support this Australian initiative. Harmonizing NAFTA, CER, and AFTA is a practical step toward trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific.
<p>
<li><b>Participate fully in APEC's concerted unilateralism process.</b> There are too many differences among APEC members at present for negotiations on an APEC free trade and investment agreement to succeed. Before work can begin on a region-wide free trade zone, the APEC process must be strengthened. The strategy of concerted unilateralism allows members to take small but concrete steps each year toward APEC's ultimate goal of free trade and investment by 2020. Only if APEC members gain confidence in each other over the next few years can a more formal negotiating process be expected to succeed.
<p>
<li><b> Work with Australia to complete unfinished items from the Uruguay Round of GATT talks.</b> At the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Singapore, the President should support Canberra's proposal to complete unfinished items from the Uruguay Round. Washington must work with Canberra to reach agreements on liberalized trade in basic telecommunications and maritime transport services by 1997. They also should work together to prepare for the new negotiations on agricultural trade liberalization that are scheduled to begin in 1999.
<p>
<li><b> Propose convening a new WTO round with the goal of achieving a global free trade and investment agreement by 2020.</b> The President should exercise bold leadership and press other WTO members at Singapore to convene a new round of global trade liberalization talks by 1998. The new WTO round should subsume APEC's goal of free trade and investment by 2020 as its own. This policy could encourage APEC to accelerate the liberalization of trade and investment in Asia. It would not be the first time that trade liberalization in one set of negotiations spurred liberalization in another. In the early 1990s, for example, the creation of APEC helped bring the Uruguay Round negotiations to a successful conclusion.
<p>
<li><b> Enhance American military ties to Australia.</b> The agreement to stage military exercises in Australia will provide U.S. forces with a better location than Japan and Okinawa for training. Relocating training exercises from these highly populated areas also may reduce public opposition to critical U.S. defense bases there. A renewed lease on the Pine Gap intelligence facility will benefit U.S. strategic goals in Asia and the Middle East. In return, the U.S. should offer to sell Canberra <i>Tomahawk</i> long-range cruise missiles for Australia's new <i>Collins</i>-class submarines. The U.S. also should include Australia in the development of any future Asian missile defense network.
</ul>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Like Rip Van Winkle, who slept through the American Revolution, an Australian who dozed off 20 years ago and suddenly woke up today would find a very different country. For many years, Australia resisted developing an Asian Pacific identity. That resistance has given way to acceptance of Australia's destiny as a country embracing Asia and immersing itself in the Asian market.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Australia's transformation benefits the United States in ways that should not be overlooked by U.S. policymakers. By opening its economy, Australia has expanded the market for American exports and investments. It also is a well-positioned ally that can help the United States promote trade and investment liberalization throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. has an unprecedented opportunity to help itself by working more closely with Australia in the Asia-Pacific region. Washington should take the fullest possible advantage of this opportunity by making every effort to remove irritants in its bilateral relations with Canberra. Chief among these irritants are counterproductive agriculture programs and the Jones Act, which hurt not only Australia farmers and shipbuilders, but also American consumers. The U.S. and Australia also should cooperate closely to ensure the success of the upcoming APEC and WTO meetings. Finally, the U.S. should continue and strengthen its military ties to Australia to help maintain peace in the Asia-Pacific. In these ways, the U.S. can expand markets for American goods and services while reversing the dangerous perception of declining American influence in Asia.

<li>    The "Banana republic" comment was made during a radio interview with John Laws on May 14, 1986.<p>
<li>    Prior to 1996, U.S. agricultural programs were like a dike separating two bodies of water. One body is domestic prices; the other, world prices. When the U.S. increases agricultural subsidies and import barriers to maintain domestic prices at a higher level than world prices, foreign production that would have been sold in the U.S. is sold in other markets, and the larger supplies in other markets drive down world prices. But when the U.S. lowers agricultural subsidies and import barriers, American food imports increase. Thus, removing the dike simultaneously lowers domestic agricultural prices and raises world prices until they become identical.<p>
<li>    Dairy products are an exception.<p>
<li>    To maintain domestic prices of butter, cheese, and powdered milk, the federal government purchases any surplus of these products from processors at a fixed price ($10.35 per hundredweight in 1996). The federal government and the state of California use milk marketing orders that restrict the sale of fluid milk between different regions to maintain domestic milk prices. To limit foreign competition, the U.S. employs a tariff rate quota system that establishes country-by-country quotas for dairy imports. Under this system (as distinguished from a pure quota system), exporting countries may exceed their dairy import quotas, but the U.S. levies a prohibitively high tariff on dairy imports exceeding the quota.<p>
<li>    American exporters receive cash or surplus dairy products from the federal government as a bonus for exporting dairy products to targeted markets. This moves dairy products from the domestic market to targeted foreign markets such as Algeria, Brazil, Jamaica, India, Iraq, and Mexico, simultaneously raising domestic dairy prices while reducing dairy prices in targeted foreign markets.<p>
<li>    A tariff rate quota system differs from a pure quota system. It permits imports above the quota but also levies a prohibitively high tariff rate on them. Thus, imports effectively are limited to the quota amount in most circumstances. <p>
<li>    If Congress were allowed to amend trade agreements, Congress would likely accept the concessions that foreign governments made to reach a deal while voting to reject U.S. concessions. Such an outcome obviously is unacceptable to any foreign government. To encourage foreign governments to negotiate trade agreements with the United States, Congress devised the fast-track procedure to force itself to accept or reject trade agreements as a whole.<p>
<li>    The most important dispute concerns how to prevent telecommunications firms with monopolies in their home market for international services from undercutting other suppliers in competitive markets for international services. As a compromise, Australia proposed a safeguard that would allow a country to revoke a foreign firm's license to provide international services if that firm distorts the market with such cross-subsidies.<p>

<title>AID Should Release Economic Freedom Report Now - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>AID SHOULD RELEASE ECONOMIC FREEDOM REPORT NOW</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan T. Johnson</a><br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 464<br>
October 16, 1996 <br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Concerned over the wastefulness of America's foreign aid program, Congress last year mandated that the Agency for International Development (AID) submit a report on the status of economic freedom in countries receiving U.S. aid. The report was due this summer. It is now October, however, and still no report. The Clinton Administration should fulfill its obligation under the law and submit AID's economic freedom report to Congress immediately.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Economic Freedom Report.</b> The appropriations bill for foreign operations, passed in November 1995 and signed into law by President Clinton in February 1996, requires AID to "submit to the appropriate congressional committees an annual report providing a concise overview of the prospects for economic and social growth.... For each country, the report shall discuss the laws, policies and practices of that country that most contribute to or detract from the achievement of this kind of growth."<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why this report has not been completed is a mystery. The reason certainly cannot be a lack of resources. With operating expenses of $465 million, 2,400 permanent employees, and some 6,000 long-term contractors and consultants, AID should have had no difficulty finding the resources to produce such a report and submit it to Congress on time.<sup>2</sup>  Nor can the reason be a lack of information on levels of economic freedom in the world. There now are three privately produced studies this subject: The Heritage Foundation's <i>Index of Economic Freedom</i>, Freedom House's <i>World Survey of Economic Freedom</i>, and the Fraser Institute's <i>Economic Freedom of the World</i>. While there are minor differences among these studies in the methodologies used to measure economic freedom, all three agree that economic freedom is essential to economic growth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most likely reason for AID's failure to submit its report is the low priority the foreign aid bureaucracy gives to economic freedom. For example, of the $12 billion in foreign aid spending, AID earmarks only 13 percent for what it calls "achieving sustainable development."  Of this 13 percent, most of money is spent to protect the environment, educate the poor, control populations, and immunize infants. Some of these programs may be useful, but they hardly qualify as programs aimed at promoting economic growth in less developed countries. A well-educated person living in a clean environment and given good health care will not be able to enjoy those benefits if private property is outlawed, there is no rule of law, and people are not free to work. Economic freedom, not environmental or population controls, creates economic growth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>AID's Neglect of Economic Freedom.</b> This failure to understand the central role of economic freedom in economic development is a principal reason for AID's failed approach to foreign aid. The Heritage Foundation's 1996 <i>Index of Economic Freedom</i> evaluates the level of economic freedom in 142 countries. Examining taxation, trade and investment, banking, regulation, monetary, and other policies, the <i>Index</i> demonstrates that of these 142 countries, those with the greatest economic freedom also are the richest. Conversely, those that are the most economically repressed are the poorest. Consider the following:
<p><ul>
<li> Of the 76 countries ranked as "mostly unfree" or "repressed," 35 have received U.S. foreign aid for at least 36 years, many for as long as 52 years;
<p>
<li> Of these 35 countries, 25 are no better off economically today than they were before receiving aid;
<p>
<li> Of these 25, 13 actually are poorer today than they were over three decades ago.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The evidence in the <i>Index</i> demonstrates what many economists have known for years: No matter how much foreign aid is pumped into less developed economies, they will not grow economically until they begin to free their economies from excessive government constraint.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It was Congress's belief in this fact that prompted it last year to require that AID submit a report on economic freedom. Critics of AID will be watching to see how reliable and accurate it will be in evaluating the economic policies of U.S. aid recipients. They will be scrutinizing AID's assessment of barriers to U.S. exports, whether American companies are free to invest in other countries, and whether aid recipients still do not respect private property rights.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With over 8,000 employees, consultants, and contractors, and $465 million in operating expenses, AID surely has enough resources to fulfill its legal obligations to Congress and the American people. By not submitting its report on economic freedom to Congress, AID is violating a specific congressional directive. Whether AID is finally giving economic freedom the attention it deserves cannot be known until it submits its report. However, one thing is already clear: The agency remains one of the most poorly run and ineffective in the U.S. government. AID should release its report on economic freedom immediately.

Conservative Successes in the 104<sup>th</sup> Congress</h3><br><hr></center><br>
<table border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=5><tr><td>
Conservatives have achieved amazing success in transforming government and the way Congress does business. Despite setbacks and  presidential vetos, the 104th Congress has met the high expectations of conservatives in several key areas by beginning a revolutionary reversal of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture, and regulation.
<p>
	It took 60 years to build the modern welfare state, and it will take more than just two years to do what is needed to reform it. The 104th Congress, however, has taken significant steps to reduce the size of the federal government and to empower states, local communities, and individuals. President Clinton has stated that "the era of big government is over." The 104th Congress actually has done something to turn this rhetoric into reality.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
U.S. military strength in Asia underpins deterrence and U.S. leadership in Asia. If the two Koreas were to reunify, American ground troops would likely be reduced, and American air power in Asia would become much more important in maintaining deterrence. China's recent purchase from Russia of co-production rights for the Sukhoi SU-27 <I>Flanker</I> jet fighter represents a significant step in Beijing's ambition to build a world-class air force. Currently, the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) is saddled with thousands of obsolete Soviet-era combat aircraft and is deficient in advanced munitions, electronic warfare systems, logistics, and training. The SU-27 will be China's first jet fighter with capabilities roughly equivalent to current U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine fighters. U.S. intelligence reportedly estimates that China may obtain up to 300 SU-27s. If successful in absorbing the Sukhoi's technology and production know-how, China eventually could challenge American air superiority in Asia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To sustain deterrence in Asia, the U.S. must proceed with programs to build advanced fighter aircraft and munitions that will guarantee American air superiority in Asia. Specifically, the U.S. should:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Sustain funding for the F-22A jet fighter.</b> This is the only U.S. jet fighter currently in development that promises a clear level of superiority to the SU-27.

<p><li><b>Maintain 12 Navy aircraft carrier battle groups.</b> The Clinton defense budget puts at risk the Navy's ability to project power in Asia. Should budget pressures force a reduction in carrier battle groups, the Navy may be required to deploy its Seventh Fleet carrier, now homeported in Japan, to non-Asian trouble spots for increasing periods of time, thereby reducing the U.S. deterrent in Asia.

<p><li><b>Develop an air-superiority fighter for the Navy.</b> With the Navy's F-14 Tomcat to be phased out by 2010, the Navy will need a fighter that is clearly superior to the Russian SU-27.

<p><li><b>Accelerate development of a helmet-sighted missile and make advanced U.S. air-to-air missiles available to U.S. allies.</b> The U.S. and its allies should have such a system to counter current Russian helmet-sighted missiles sold to China.

<p><li><b>Develop advanced versions of the F-16 and F-18 for allied and friendly Asian air forces.</b> The danger is that the U.S. could lose sales to future European or Russian aircraft.

<p><li><b>Ask Russia and Israel to curtail sales of advanced combat aircraft and related technology to China.</b> Russia and Israel should be told that they are helping to accelerate a military modernization program that could destabilize Asia.
</ul>
<p>

<b>CHINA'S SU-27 DEAL</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In February, it was reported that Moscow and Beijing had reached agreement on a $2.2 billion deal for China to begin co-producing the Sukhoi SU-27.<sup>1</sup>  The Chinese designation for this aircraft will be the J-11. China had purchased an initial batch of 24 SU-27s in 1991 for about $1 billion. These aircraft were reported to have been delivered by the end of 1992 and are based at Wuhu Air Base, about 150 miles east of Shanghai.<sup>2</sup>  In May of last year, it was reported that China had purchased a second batch of 22 aircraft as a prelude to the larger co-production deal.<sup>3</sup>  Former Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said the second batch of SU-27s was delivered in April.<sup>4</sup>  These aircraft will be based at Suixi Air Base in Southern China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Estimates vary as to the final number of SU-27s that China may purchase or co-produce. According to one report, the first co-production contract would enable the Chinese to produce 40 to 60 aircraft from Russian-made components over the next three years.<sup>5</sup>  According to another source, China may obtain a total of 72 to 78 SU-27s from this deal, enough to equip three regiments of the PLAAF, followed by co-production after five years.<sup>6</sup>  Yet another source states that China will purchase 120 sets of prefabricated components for assembly in China, with indigenous production phased in later.<sup>7</sup>  Finally, a Pentagon intelligence assessment concludes that China eventually may obtain as many as 300 SU-27s.<sup>8</sup>  In any event, it is reasonable to assume that the total could exceed 100; and if China masters full co-production, the total (to include Chinese-designed variants) could exceed several hundred.
<p>

<b>COMPARING THE SU-27 WITH CURRENT U.S. FIGHTERS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because the SU-27 will play a significant role in modernizing the PLAAF, it is useful to compare it to existing U.S. fighter aircraft. Some key performance parameters are listed in Table 1. Since entering service in 1986, the SU-27 has been the best fourth-generation air-superiority fighter in service with the Russian Air Force.<sup>9</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The SU-27 is roughly comparable to the F-15C, the best U.S. Air Force fighter. The F-15C is the only U.S. fighter used almost exclusively for air-superiority missions. Over 400 F-15Cs have been purchased by the United States Air Force, and 108 are deployed in U.S. Pacific Command.<sup>10</sup>  This aircraft accounted for 36 of the 39 USAF air-to-air victories in the Gulf War. The F-15C will remain the principal U.S. Air Force air-superiority fighter until replaced by the Lockheed-Martin F-22 later in the next decade.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The F-15C and the SU-27 have comparable ranges, though the SU-27 can carry ten missiles while the F-15C can carry eight. The F-15's ability to maneuver is about the same as the SU-27's.<sup>11</sup>  Both are capable of difficult maneuvers that stress the airframe to nine times the weight of the aircraft. The F-15C uses the AN/ANG-70 radar, which can detect targets about 100 miles away and can track and engage multiple targets. The SU-27's Phazatron N001 radar has a search range of over 62 miles with the ability to track 10 targets and engage two. However, unlike the F-15, the SU-27 is equipped with an infrared search and tracking (IRST) system with a range of from 15 to 31 miles that directs gun and missile systems.<sup>12</sup>  This system allows the <I>Flanker</I> to track and engage targets while turning off its radar, decreasing the chances of detection by opposing aircraft.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Grumman F-14, the U.S. Navy's primary air-superiority fighter, is a better all-around combat interception system than the SU-27. Were it not for the F-14's swing-wing, the SU-27 might be much more maneuverable that the F-14. The F-14 can carry six long-range or medium-range and two short-range air-to-air missiles (AAMs), but its unrefueled range is less than the SU-27's. With the added flexibility of a two-man crew, the F-14A's AN/AWG-9 weapons control system can detect targets out to 190 miles, track 24, and engage six at long range with its 100-mile-range AIM-54 <I>Phoenix</I> missiles.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Fourteen Navy squadrons are now equipped with F-14As, including two deployed with the Japan-based Seventh Fleet. The F-14A's principal weakness has been its Pratt and Whitney TF-30 turbofan engines, which are prone to stalling during hard maneuvers. This has led to engine failures and many crashes. Consequently, certain combat maneuvers are now restricted until these aircraft are modified with updated control systems. All F-14As are due to be retired from service by 2004. Over 90 F-14Bs, which now equip five Navy squadrons, have been fitted with more powerful and responsive General Electric F110 engines. The Navy also has acquired 56 F-14Ds with the F110 engines and more powerful radar combat systems. Three squadrons are outfitted with the F-14D. The F-14B and D are expected to serve through the next decade. A program to build a successor to the F-14, the A/F-X, was canceled by the Clinton Administration in 1993.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Later in the next decade, as the F-14 is being retired from U.S. Navy inventory, the numerically most important U.S. Navy fighter will be the F/A-18E/F. The Navy expects to purchase over 1,000 of these aircraft by 2015. They are designed to replace the current C/D version of the F/A-18, the F-14, and the long-range ground-attack Grumman A-6 <I>Intruder</I>.<sup>13</sup>  Compared to both versions of the F/A-18, however, the SU-27 has an advantage in unrefueled range and may be more maneuverable due to its more powerful engines and larger wing. The F/A-18E/F is about 25 percent larger than the C/D; has more powerful engines and a longer range because of larger external fuel tanks; and is to be equipped presently with an AN/AGP-73 multi-mode radar, which also equips the most current production model of the F/A-18C. More advanced radar upgrades already are planned for the F/A-18E.<sup>14</sup>  In terms of offensive and defensive electronic systems, the F-18E/F will be superior to the SU-27.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The F-16 also is a multi-role fighter designed for ground-attack as well as air-defense missions. It is the most numerous combat aircraft in the U.S. Air Force, currently numbering over 1,200 aircraft. Forces with the U.S. Pacific Command possess 138 F-16Cs, the major combat aircraft for South Korea. An earlier version, the F-16A, is the most capable combat aircraft in the air forces of Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand, and soon of Taiwan. Shorter in unrefueled range than the SU-27, the F-16C carries only six medium-range or short-range AAMs. The F-16 is a single-engine aircraft, while the SU-27, F-15, F-14, and F/A-18 are twin-engine aircraft with greater survivability in combat. The F-16 is roughly comparable to the SU-27 in maneuverability; both airframes can be stressed to nine times their weight.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Northrop F-5E <I>Tiger II</I> currently is the most numerous combat aircraft for Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The F-5E is no match for the SU-27 in maneuverability, range, or weapons load. Several companies offer upgrades for the F-5's radar and combat systems. These upgrades can ease pilot workload and increase search and detection capability, but they cannot alter the F-5's inferior aerodynamic performance. As a consequence, prosperous Asian countries are acquiring new, more capable aircraft like the F-16 and F-18.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>The U.S. Technology Advantage.</b> Compared to the SU-27, all current U.S. combat aircraft benefit from better cockpit design and better avionics. For example, the U.S. practice of placing most combat relevant information on a large Head-Up Display (HUD) which combines the functions of a monitor and a weapons sight, or on large, easy-to-read flat-panel displays on the instrument panel, increases combat potential by allowing pilots to spend more time watching for opposing aircraft than tending instruments. Better U.S. aircraft computers and cockpit displays enable U.S. pilots to evaluate information more quickly and accurately. By contrast, similar Russian systems used in early models of the SU-27 are less advanced. American aircraft also are equipped with better countermeasures against radar and missile threats. These include electronic jamming systems and decoys that use several methods to confuse attacking missiles.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine fighters have long benefited from a well-developed system of in-air refueling which extends range or combat patrol time. The U.S. also benefits from advanced airborne warning and control (AWACS) aircraft, such as the E-2C <I>Hawkeye</I> and E-3 <I>Sentry</I>. In addition, the three services employ a range of electronic intelligence aircraft that warn fighters of enemy radar and missile defenses. The Navy's EA-6B is designed to jam enemy radars, while the F-16 HTS, F/A-18, and EA-6B can use anti-radar missiles to destroy enemy air defenses.

<b>THE CHINESE AIR FORCE AND THE CHALLENGE OF THE SU-27</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The acquisition of the SU-27 and its production rights marks a major turn for the Chinese Air Force. Nevertheless, this service is beset with major weaknesses. The foremost is that the PLAAF currently is saddled with over 2,000 aircraft (including MiG-19s, MiG-21s, and TU-16s) of 1950s-era Soviet design comparable to outdated U.S. fighters like the F-100, F-8, and B-47. These aircraft are no match for current U.S. jet fighters. In addition, the Chinese Air Force lacks the capability to refuel its combat aircraft during flight, and this shortens their range. It also is bereft of AWACS aircraft that manage air battles, fire-and-forget long-range air-to-air missiles, anti-radar missiles to attack enemy air defenses, and precision-guided munitions (PGMs) like laser-guided bombs. These systems were critical to U.S. air superiority during the Persian Gulf War.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The PLAAF compares poorly to the USAF and some Asian air forces in areas of training and maintenance. A RAND Corporation study issued last year concludes that Chinese Air Force pilots do not fly as often as their U.S. counterparts.<sup>15</sup>  Chinese pilots typically fly 100 hours a year, while U.S. pilots train more than 200 hours per year. Chinese air combat tactics resemble old Soviet-style tactics that stress tight ground control of aircraft.<sup>16</sup>  PLAAF commanders place a high priority on flight safety, and this reduces pilots' initiative and inhibits the utilization of aircraft to their fullest capabilities. While the PLAAF is beginning to utilize "Aggressor" squadrons which specialize in adversarial combat tactics in an attempt to raise tactical skills proficiency, it remains to be seen whether these new training squadrons will be effective. The PLAAF also faces another severe problem:  a lack of spare parts. One of the reasons for this is that production standards vary between differing aircraft and engine manufacturers, inhibiting interchangability of parts between aircraft and engines of the same type.<sup>17</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

RAND questioned whether China can afford the SU-27 as well as indigenous aircraft programs, pointing to recent reforms that have devalued China's currency, thereby reducing PLA purchasing power.<sup>18</sup>  However, the actual size of China's defense budget is unknown. Official figures typically fail to include all military-related expenditures and earnings from PLA-controlled businesses. For example, while the official 1994 PLA defense budget figure was $6 billion, the Washington-based Defense Budget Project estimates that it could range between $92 billion and $143 billion.<sup>19</sup>  A higher budget such as this increases the possibility that the PLA could afford multiple new aircraft programs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The RAND study estimated that China would have only 70 SU-27s in the year 2005.<sup>20</sup>  The SU-27 co-production agreement suggests that China has placed a greater emphasis on acquiring higher numbers of this aircraft in addition to its production technology. The PLA appears to want a phased transition to full co-production, preceded by domestic assembly of a large number of aircraft from major components fabricated in Russia. Co-production of the SU-27 will be difficult for the Chinese because this aircraft incorporates technologies the Chinese cannot yet produce. But PLA aircraft manufacturers will benefit from advanced Russian production techniques and from the presence of Russian technicians, who will assist SU-27 assembly and eventual production.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Chinese Air Force Difficulties with the SU-27.</b> Integrating the SU-27 into its inventory will not be easy for the PLAAF. The Chinese Air Force has had difficulty maintaining the SU-27 and was not prepared for its additional cost. Moreover, some runways are not capable of handling this heavier fighter aircraft.<sup>21</sup>  However, the SU-27 is being used in exercises. In August 1995, Chinese SU-27s approached the Senkaku Islands north of Taiwan, which are claimed by China, Japan, and Taiwan. And in March 1996, the SU-27 flew in major military exercises intended to intimidate Taiwan on the eve of its presidential election. The SU-27 possibly will be seen more frequently over the South China Sea, flying from Suixi Air Base in South China. From Wuhu and Suixi Bases, the SU-27 can reach Taiwan, many disputed areas in the South China Sea, and U.S. forces based on Okinawa (see map). Despite early difficulties in tactics and training, as well as enduring PLAAF institutional constraints, it is entirely possible that as more SU-27s enter service, the PLAAF will learn how to exploit this system to its fullest capabilities some time in the next decade.

OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAY ASSIST CHINA'S AIR FORCE MODERNIZATION

	</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Advanced military technology from Russia and Israel plays a major role in China's effort to modernize its military forces. This is especially true for the PLAAF. Russia in particular is viewed by China as a potential source for many systems and technologies that comprise a modern, all-weather, multi-mission air force. Advanced air-to-air missiles, precision-guided munitions, radar aircraft, and electronic countermeasures are all on China's shopping list. For now, Russia appears to be more interested in profit than in any potential threat to its interests arising from sales to China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Advantage <i>Archer</i>.</b> The SU-27 is equipped with a series of advanced Russian missiles that in some cases exceed or equal U.S. missile capabilities. The PLAAF is the only air force in Asia to possess the Russian R-73 (NATO codename:  AA-11 <i>Archer</i>) air-to-air missile. China is believed to have an early version of the <i>Archer </i>(M1) and is known to have used it against parachute flares during March 1996 exercises near Taiwan. The AA-11 is the first effective "helmet-sighted" air-to-air missile to be employed anywhere. With this missile, a pilot can aim his weapon by turning his head, and does not have to line up his plane with the target, which has been the main practice in aerial combat since World War I. The M1 version can be fired 45 degrees off the aircraft's forward line-of-direction, or off-boresight, to a range of 12.4 miles (see chart).<sup>22</sup>  The M2 version of the AA-11 can be fired up to 60 degrees off-boresight and has a range of 18.6 miles.<sup>23</sup>  In targeting aircraft beyond visual range, the AA-11 can be cued by the <i>Flanker's </i>infrared tracking system.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In the hands of a capable pilot, the <i>Archer </i>conveys a decisive margin for victory. During 1994 air combat exercises between German and U.S. aircraft, MiG-29s of the German Air Force armed with the less capable version of the <i>Archer </i>had a clear advantage over U.S. F-16s armed with <i>Sidewinder</i>.<sup>24</sup>  Even though the F-16 was able to outmaneuver the MiG in 60 percent of the exercise engagements, the MiG already had "fired" its <i>Archer</i>, meaning the F-16 most likely was defeated.<sup>25</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The U.S. is not expected to field a helmet-sighted thrust-vectored AAM for at least six years. The AIM-9M <i>Sidewinder</i>, the most modern U.S. short-range air-to-air missile -- which lacks a helmet sight -- can acquire targets only 27.5 degrees off the forward line-of-sight and has a range of only 4.8 miles. American defense officials assert that the lack of a helmet-sighted missile is compensated for by the 32-mile-range Advanced Medium-Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM). This missile, called the AIM-120, is guided by its own radar, allowing the pilot to break aircraft radar contact with the target and begin evasion. This was not the case with earlier U.S. radar-guided missiles. U.S. officials argue that the AIM-120 confers much of the same tactical flexibility as the <i>Archer</i>.<sup>26</sup>  However, the U.S. still has some difficulty in exploiting the long range of the AIM-120. For one thing, it has problems with identifying targets.<sup>27</sup>  Moreover, this missile cannot be used by the F-16A or the F-5E. While U.S. fighters in Asia have the AIM-120, so far only South Korea and Thailand are approved to buy it. Equipped with AIM-120, the F-15, F-14, F-16, and F/A-18 all have a fighting chance against the SU-27. But the Russians also have their AIM-120 equivalent in the AA-12. This missile could be marketed to China in the future, and apparently has been offered for sale to the U.S.<sup>28</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China also could acquire newer, more advanced Russian missiles and precision-guided munitions. For example, the Kh-17 (NATO codename:  AS-17 <i>Krypton</i>) missile has multiple versions that are designed to attack ships and AWACS radar aircraft at long range. The U.S. Navy is evaluating this missile for possible use as a target to simulate future threats for naval missile defense systems. One version of this missile is credited with a 125-mile range, and all versions are capable of flying at almost three times the speed of sound.<sup>29</sup>  U.S. Naval Intelligence also is concerned about a new 200-mile-range AAM designed to attack AWACS and other long-range radar aircraft.<sup>30</sup>  Russia also produces a series of laser-guided and television-guided bombs that could arm future variants of the SU-27 produced by China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Russian Technology and China's SU-27s.</b> Russia now plans to market advanced versions of the SU-27 to China, as it already has to India. There are reports that a deal for China to purchase the more advanced SU-30 broke down over financing disagreements.<sup>31</sup>  The SU-30 is a two-seat dedicated attack variant of the SU-27 with more advanced attack systems that allow for delivery of precision-guided munitions.<sup>32</sup>  Moscow and Beijing also may have discussed Chinese co-production of the SU-35.<sup>33</sup>  The SU-35 features a better cockpit display, better missile fire-control systems, and forward horizontal control surfaces that boost maneuverability. According to Lt. General George Muellner, Principal Deputy to the Air Force Assistant Secretary, the SU-35's "missile fire control system is as good or better than the F-15."<sup>34</sup>  Sukhoi unveiled last year a variant of the SU-35 with thrust-vectored engines, called the SU-37, which Russian pilots claim will be "10-times" better in close-in dogfights than unmodified fighters.<sup>35</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>AWACS and Aerial Refueling.</b> A number of reports indicate China also is seeking other "force-multipliers" the U.S. has long utilized, like AWACS and air-refueling capabilities. Russian AWACS aircraft and Israel's <i>Phalcon </i>early-warning aircraft appear to be on Beijing's shopping list.<sup>36</sup>  In a reported $250 million deal with China, Israel will put its <i>Phalcon </i>200-mile-range airborne early warning radar on a Russian Il-76 transport aircraft.<sup>37</sup>  This aircraft may also carry advanced Israeli electronic sensing and intelligence systems. China is reported to have modified up to five of its H-6 bombers to refuel J-8II <i>Finback </i>fighters -- the most advanced fighter China currently produces. This extends the range of the J-8II from 430 to over 630 miles. U.S. intelligence reportedly estimates China may convert up to 20 H-6 bombers into air-to-air refueling aircraft.<sup>38</sup>  China's SU-27s are not modified for air-to-air refueling, but this capability could be acquired later.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China is using Russian technology to upgrade the J-8II with modern radar and engines which give the aircraft greater combat capability.<sup>39</sup>  An upgraded version of this aircraft, the J-8II M, was test-flown at the end of March.<sup>40</sup> There are about 200 J-8s in the Chinese Naval Air Force and Air Force. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China is co-developing the FC-1 lightweight fighter with Pakistan which also may use a Russian engine radar and avionics, or a European radar.<sup>41</sup>This aircraft may be slightly less maneuverable than the F-16, and China initially may buy 100 copies. The FC-1 also could be marketed as a low-cost successor to aircraft such as the F-5E and Mig-21, which continue to be used widely in less-developed countries.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Israeli Assistance and China's J-10 Advanced Fighter Program.</b> Israel maintains a quiet but significant military technology relationship with China. Its largest military program with China involves the development of the J-10 advanced fighter aircraft, modeled on Israel's <i>Lavi </i>fighter that was canceled in 1987.<sup>42</sup>  Russian radar and engines also may feature prominently in the J-10 program.<sup>43</sup>  Last year, RAND Corporation analyst Mark Lorell concluded that the J-10 will benefit from the <i>Lavi's </i>"advanced airframe technology, [and] superior avionics.... "<sup>44</sup> China revealed in April a model of the J-10 that was similar to the <i>Lavi</i>. The model also showed the J-10 armed with the PL-10 short-range air-to-air missile, a copy of the Israeli <i>Python </i><i>3 </i>missile. The U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence estimates the J-10 may be more maneuverable than the F/A-18E/F but will carry less sophisticated radar and countermeasures.<sup>45</sup>  The first prototype may fly this year, and China eventually may produce 300 J-10s.<sup>46</sup>  Washington is concerned that U.S.-originated technology from the <i>Lavi </i>has been transferred to China.<sup>47</sup>  Israel is reported to have rebuffed Clinton Administration attempts to end this program.<sup>48</sup>

<b>Could China's SU-27 Go to Sea?</b> Central Military Commission (CMC) Vice President Liu Haquing, a former top PLA Navy commander, believes China needs the ability to dominate the Pacific from Japan down to the Philippines and should be able to fight as far away as Guam.<sup>49</sup>  Acquiring an aircraft carrier to help fulfill this goal appears to be a high PLA priority, and there are reports that at a December meeting of the CMC, President Jaing Zemin endorsed construction of an aircraft carrier as part of the next five-year plan.<sup>50</sup>  However, the cost of a carrier and its attendant defensive and logistic support ships may prove prohibitive for the Chinese Navy. But should China acquire its first aircraft carrier, perhaps in the next decade, the U.S. could face a Chinese sea-borne version of the SU-27. China could follow the example of Russia, which now uses a version of the SU-27 (called the SU-33) as the principal combat aircraft for its sole aircraft carrier, the <I>Admiral Kuznetzov.</I> Unlike the basic version of the SU-27, the SU-33 is equipped for air-to-air refueling, both to receive fuel and to carry a modified fuel tank that can perform in-flight refueling. The SU-33's engines generate enough thrust to allow the use of a ski-jump to get airborne, eliminating the need for complex steam-driven catapults used on U.S. Navy carriers.
<p>

<b>MEETING THE CHALLENGE OF CHINA'S SU-27</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

American leadership in Asia rests upon several factors, including a willingness to maintain sufficient military force to deter potential adversaries. In the event Korea is reunified, the U.S. very likely will withdraw ground troops stationed there, leaving the Air Force and the Navy to function as the dominant elements of the U.S. military presence in Asia. The U.S. Pacific Command now relies on about 350 Air Force, Navy, and Marine fighter and attack aircraft deployed in South Korea, Japan, Alaska, and Hawaii. One aircraft carrier, the <I>USS Independence</I>, provides the most flexible component of American airpower in Asia. In March 1996, two carrier battle groups, led by the <i>Independence </i>and the <I>USS Nimitz</I>, were ordered to locations near Taiwan in response to China's threatening military exercises. The U.S. reportedly has decided to halt regular Middle East deployments by the <I>Independence</I> in order to respond to possible scenarios involving North Korea or China.<sup>51</sup>  Such is the importance of U.S. naval power to peace and stability in Asia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Were it to occur, China's acquisition of large numbers of SU-27s would pose a serious challenge to U.S. air superiority. Since World War II, American military commanders have aimed to establish air superiority in order to win battles on the sea and ground. Although China may not today be able to utilize the SU-27 to its fullest extent, it cannot be assumed that this will continue indefinitely. To sustain deterrence, the U.S. needs to maintain its all-around edge in strategy, tactics, and weapons systems.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In particular, aircraft that are "good enough" or slightly superior to the SU-27 do not provide a sufficient margin of superiority to guarantee U.S. dominance in the air. The U.S. must proceed with plans to field advanced combat aircraft superior to the SU-27. Current and future aircraft must be equipped with an effective helmet-sighted missile to counter the <i>Archer</i>. Failure to do so risks allowing the Asian balance of power to shift dangerously in favor of China. To prevent this from happening, Washington should:<p>

<b>Sustain funding for the F-22A jet fighter.</b><br>
To ensure U.S. air superiority in Asia, the U.S. should proceed with full funding for the Lockheed-Martin F-22A. This aircraft promises better uses of radar-evading stealth technology, engines that can achieve supersonic speeds without using fuel-guzzling afterburners, thrust vectoring that enhances maneuverability at high speeds, and advanced radar and electronic combat systems. It can carry four short-range air-to-air missiles and up to ten AMRAAM missiles and has a combat range comparable to the F-15C. There are suggestions from Pentagon officials that the planned purchase of 442 F-22As may be cut in half due to funding constraints.<sup>52</sup>  This would be a mistake because it would likely reduce the number of F-22As, which are needed to deter potential adversaries. The Air Force is requesting $2 billion for FY 1997 for research and development as part of an expected $70 billion program. This is indeed expensive, but the F-22A is the only U.S. fighter in development that can offer decisive air superiority for U.S. forces.
<p>
<b>Maintain 12 Navy aircraft carrier battle groups.</b><br>
The U.S. Navy needs at least 12 aircraft carrier battle groups in order to sustain peacetime security commitments. These commitments include the maintenance of one carrier battle group with the Seventh Fleet in Japan. However, the Clinton defense budget could force a reduction to eight carrier battle groups by the year 2002. If this occurs, the U.S. may have to deploy its Seventh Fleet carrier to potential crisis areas outside of Asia,<sup>53</sup> in which case carriers would not be available to respond sufficiently to some future Chinese provocation against Taiwan. This would be regarded by Washington's friends and potential adversaries in Asia as a significant reduction in the traditional U.S. commitment to preserve peace in Asia. To deter future potential conflicts in Asia that could damage U.S. economic and military security, the U.S. must have 12 carrier battle groups to sustain deterrence.
<p>
<b>Develop an air-superiority fighter for the Navy.</b><br>
The Clinton Administration should review its 1993 decision to forgo development of a dedicated successor to the Navy's F-14 fighter aircraft. The A/F-X program, canceled in 1993, had attracted proposals from Lockheed to develop a naval variant of the F-22. If U.S. naval task forces are to be superior to all opponents, the Navy will need a fighter with at least the capability of the F-22. While the F/A-18E/F is an impressive aircraft that incorporates advances in air combat and ground-attack systems, it does not present a decisive advance in capability over the SU-27/35 family. The Navy needs the F/A-18E/F to fulfill fighter and ground attack missions. But the Navy also needs an aircraft that will guarantee naval air superiority against the SU-27 and its advanced variants. In the meantime, as the F-14A is cycled out of Navy inventory early in the next decade, it is essential that the Asia-deployed Seventh Fleet receive priority in retaining F-14B/Ds.
<p>
The only other major combat aircraft program in the Navy's future is the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), which is scheduled to enter service after 2010. But this aircraft also is the next major aircraft program for the Marines and the Air Force. In all, the JSF is intended to replace such diverse aircraft as the A-6, the AV-8 <i>Harrier</i>, Britain's <I>Sea Harrier</I>, the F-14, the F-16, and the F-18. The Air Force wants an F-16 replacement that is inexpensive, while the Navy seeks stealthy long-range strike aircraft. The JSF is not expected to be much larger or much more maneuverable than an F-16, but it will incorporate stealth and advanced combat systems. According to General Muellner, for the Air Force, the JSF would "not be on the leading edge of air supremacy," but would compliment the F-22.<sup>54</sup>  The Navy version of the JSF should pay greater attention to the air-superiority mission, meaning increased range and increased internal air-to-air missile carriage; if it cannot approach the air superiority capabilities of the F-22, the Navy should be directed to begin development of a fighter that provides a dedicated replacement for the F-14.
<p>
<b>Accelerate development of a helmet-sighted missile and make advanced U.S. air-to-air missiles available to U.S. allies.</b><br>
It is critical that the Pentagon be directed to accelerate the development of a helmet-sighted and highly maneuverable short-range AAM. Israel, for example, was able to field its 90-degree off-boresight-capable, helmet-sighted <I>Python 4</I> short-range AAM in about half the time it is expected to take the U.S. to field its helmet-sighted AAM.<sup>55</sup>  A former senior Joint Chiefs of Staff officer was quoted recently as saying that "For the Air Force and Navy not to have a helmet-mounted sight and off-boresight missile is absolutely criminal."<sup>56</sup>  U.S. aircraft and those of Asian allies armed only with <i>Sidewinder </i>AAMs are at a distinct disadvantage when compared with Chinese SU-27s armed with the Russian <i>Archer </i>AAM. When a helmet-sighted missile enters U.S. service, it also should be made available for sale to Asian allies and friends. In the meantime, the U.S. should sell the AIM-120 to allies and friends with compatible aircraft. Specifically, the AIM-120 should be offered to the Republic of China as its F-16s enter service next year.
<p>
<b>Develop advanced versions of the F-15, F-16, and F-18 for allied and friendly Asian air forces.</b><br>
Most countries in Asia, except possibly Japan, will not be able to afford the F-22. The JSF also may prove to be too expensive. Therefore, the U.S. should develop advanced, more affordable versions of the F-16 and the F/A-18E/F for Asian friends and allies. The danger is that unmodified U.S. types could lose markets to newer and very capable European combat aircraft like the French <I>Rafale</I> and the <I>Eurofighter-2000</I>.<sup>57</sup>  Maintaining commonality between U.S. and Asian air forces is an important U.S. interest.
<p>
<b>Ask Russia and Israel to curtail advanced weapons sales to China.</b><br>
Sales of advanced military technology to China do more than strengthen China's military capabilities:  They also constitute a potential threat to regional peace and stability. To Russia, the U.S. should stress that a well-armed China could be less benign and more inclined, for example, to press old territorial claims. To Israel, the U.S. should stress that China might sell advanced aircraft to rogue states like Iran which pose a threat to Israel. Last June, for example, China was suspected of having shipped missile components or technology to Syria.<sup>58</sup>  The U.S. also should enlist its allies and friends in Asia to warn Russia and Israel that by arming China, they are creating a potential threat to peace.


<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

For over 50 years, the United States has enjoyed air superiority in Asia. American industry has produced combat aircraft that have been proven superior over Korea, the Taiwan Strait, Vietnam, the Middle East, and the Persian Gulf. With the demise of the Soviet Union, delay in building a fifth-generation fighter to succeed the F-15 and F-14 was justifiable. But should it occur, China's acquisition of a large inventory of SU-27 aircraft would present a major challenge to American air superiority in Asia. This poses the first major post-Cold War challenge to U.S. strategy in Asia, as America's ability to deter conflict in Asia will rely increasingly on air power.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To preserve U.S. air superiority and sustain deterrence in Asia in the next century, the U.S. should produce the F-22A jet fighter, field a helmet-sighted air to air missile, and make the AIM-120 advanced air to air missile available to allies and friends like the Republic of China. Equally important, it also is time to re-examine whether an F-14 follow-on must be built if U.S. naval air power is to retain the superiority critical to sustaining the credibility of U.S. naval forces in Asia. Finally, the U.S. should tell Russia and Israel that their sale to China of advanced weapons and technology is helping to create a potential threat to the peace and stability of the Asia region.

  <p><li> The F-15 has slightly better thrust-to-weight ratio, though wing-loadings are even at combat weights. A greater thrust-to-weight ratio and a lower wing-loading confers better combat potential. These variables help determine acceleration and turn rate in combat, and improve as aircraft weight decreases through fuel consumption. The SU-27 is said to have an instantaneous turn rate of 20 to 22 degrees per second and a sustained turn rate of 14 to 16 degrees per second. Comparable figures for the F-15 are 14 degrees and 12 degrees; see Dennis R.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has kept its promise to the American people that it would begin to cut regulatory red tape and return common sense to regulation. It has reduced the size and cost of government and increased the health and well-being of all Americans. But alarmists have done a good job of convincing the American people that exactly the opposite has been true, seizing the moral high ground with rhetoric designed to convince the public that a reformed regulatory system would have disastrous consequences. Nevertheless, this Congress can point to a record of solid reforms and progress toward a more flexible and less burdensome regulatory system that will cost less and achieve the same or higher levels of public health, safety, and environmental protection.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is the reality?  Legislation passed by the 104th Congress and signed into law:
<p>
<ul> 
<li> Repealed the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit that had been on the books since 1974.
<p>
<li> Deregulated two major industries: agriculture and telecommunications. Farmers will now be able to grow what their customers want, not what bureaucrats demand.
<p>
<li> Stemmed the tide of costly new unfunded mandates on states and localities.
<p>
<li> Moved away from "one-size-fits-all" regulations by making it easier for the needs of small businesses to be taken into consideration.
<p>
<li> Established clear goals for agencies to reduce the paperwork burden, which will save Americans as much as 70 million hours of their time (valued at more than $1 billion) this year to use for more productive activities.
<p>
<li> Made itself directly accountable to the public by giving itself the authority to review and stop burdensome, unjustified new regulations developed by federal regulators.
<p>
<li> Forced a review by the Clinton Administration of all existing and proposed federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, Congress:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Passed and sent to the President the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act, which would have required federal regulators to follow a set of rational principles in deciding whether and how to regulate. These include the use of cost-benefit analysis, sound science, and risk assessment, as well as market-based alternatives and performance standards. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed and sent to the President with bipartisan support the Common Sense Liability Reform Act which would have curbed abuses of the legal system by relieving the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed legislation to reduce the existing burdens of the Safe Drinking Water Act, one the largest unfunded environmental mandates. Signed by President Clinton on August 6, 1996, the legislation will give states and localities the flexibility to target their resources more effectively to achieve greater levels of protection.
<p>
<li> Started an important national debate about how to resurrect commonsense regulation. This Congress, for example, introduced proposals to restructure the Superfund program in ways that would encourage faster cleanups, eliminate most of the need for lawyers and the courts, and reduce federal spending while improving public health, safety, and the environment. Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration so far has blocked reform, choosing to leave in place a program in which one-third of the money will continue to go to lawyers and transaction costs while failing to clean up many of the most hazardous waste sites.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Taken together, in just 18 months this Congress has accomplished and initiated the most significant changes in more than 20 years, and has changed the terms of the debate in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulation for decades.

<p>
<b>THE BOLDEST AGENDA IN 20 YEARS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Alarmists did a good job in this first round, convincing the American public that regulatory reform was just another term for the rollback of important public health, safety, and environmental protections. As a result, Congress has not yet seen many of its most ambitious efforts to reform the Superfund program, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, the Food and Drug Administration, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration signed into law. Many in Congress believe they lost the battle to reduce the burden of regulation and cut away the approximately $700 billion in red tape<sup>2</sup> that strangles American businesses and consumers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. In less than two years, the 104th Congress accomplished unprecedented and far-reaching reforms that impose discipline on the federal regulatory decisionmaking process, deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries, and fundamentally change the way the federal government and the American people think about public health, safety, and environmental regulation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Surpassing Reagan.</b> The regulatory agenda of the 104th Congress is the boldest of the past 20 years. The successful enactment of legislation to deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries is comparable to the transportation deregulation successes of the late 1970s.<sup>3</sup>  Although the Reagan Administration had bold intentions to reverse the growth of economic and social regulation, the completed action fell short. Other than modest steps to deregulate the energy and communications industries and a new administrative review process that enjoyed some success in reducing the rate and cost of new rules, for example, the Reagan Administration could not follow through with new versions of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and Superfund, or with FDA or OSHA reform.<sup>4</sup>  Thus, the 104th Congress stands alone in the scope and scale of its reform efforts. Until now, the deregulatory accomplishments of the last 20 years focused on freeing industries to rely on market forces. But the 104th Congress also has taken on for the first time the rapid expansion of major health, safety, and environmental programs which have increased steadily since the 1970s. The costs of these "social" regulations, particularly environmental regulation, has almost tripled over the last 20 years from about $80 billion in 1977 to more than $220 billion in 1995.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress needed to take such bold action because the problems have never been worse. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li> According to <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>, the total cost of government has been estimated at $3.38 trillion, nearly $1 trillion of which results from federal and state regulation. The federal government is responsible for imposing more than $700 billion in regulatory costs each year: more than $2,800 for every man, woman, and child in America. Of the 366 days in 1996, the average American will work 184.6 days for the government. More than 40 of these days will be just to pay for the cost of federal regulations.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li> As the number of regulations has grown, so has the number of federal regulators enforcing these rules. The number of permanent, full-time regulatory staff has increased from 69,946 in 1970 to 128,566 in 1994.<sup>7</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
 And more is not always better. A seminal new study from Harvard University reveals that roughly 60,000 lives are lost every year because of the current command-and-control regulatory system, which squanders billions of dollars on efforts to eliminate risks that are negligible or nonexistent while failing to protect the public from others that are much more serious.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has fought to bring common sense back to the way federal agencies make decisions about whether and how to regulate to improve the environment and public health and safety. Today, federal regulators are no longer giving Americans the highest levels of protection for the billions of dollars they take from taxpayers, consumers, and businesses. By making sure that regulators follow rational principles that tell them to evaluate risks sensibly and consistently, consider the costs and benefits of their actions, and use market-based solutions, policymakers can do an even better job of protecting the environment and public health and safety while spending less and with fewer rules.
<p>
<b>COMMONSENSE REGULATORY REFORMS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In just 18 months, the 104th Congress has put in place a number of important reforms that will provide significant benefits to the economy and the well-being of all Americans.
<p>
<b>The Telecommunications Act of 1996</b><br>
The 104th Congress succeeded in passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-104), signed into law by President Clinton on February 8, 1996. This is the most important industry-wide deregulatory initiative undertaken by Congress in over a decade. The Act removes unnecessary layers of federal rules governing telephone, cable, and broadcasting competition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Act eventually will eliminate restrictions that prohibit competition between local and long-distance companies, as well as cable companies, so that they can offer consumers a full range of communications and entertainment services.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One 1993 study estimated that complete deregulation would help create 3.6 million more jobs by 2003 and pass along savings of roughly $63 billion a year to consumers.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Telecommunications Act does not go quite as far as the more rapid, comprehensive deregulation this study envisioned, comparable gains can still be expected over time as a result of the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Deregulation also will mean the end of the Cable Act of 1992, numerous restrictions on beneficial merger and alliance activity, and many other needless Federal Communications Commission activities.
<p>

<b>The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996</b><br>
The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-127) eliminates federal programs that manipulate production and prices of major crops (wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice) through production subsidies and acreage reduction. This legislation will mean greater freedom and enormous opportunities for rural America. By dismantling much of the restrictive straitjacket on farmers, the new law will free the U.S. economy -- farmers and related businesses -- to take full advantage of the growing global market, which should mean huge economic benefits for Americans. According to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation,<sup>10</sup> the new law will mean that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Farmers will earn an additional $16 billion in net income between 1996 and 2002.
<p>
<li> Suppliers of the inputs used in agricultural production will sell an additional $14.6 billion in products during the same period.
<p>
<li> Taken together, the agriculture community will enjoy a rise of $30.6 billion in income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, the Act establishes an Environmental Quality Improvement Program to provide funds for a cooperative effort with farmers to protect wetlands, using a flexible, incentive-oriented approach while increasing wetland acreage under the conservation program. 
<p>
<b>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</b><br>
In response to the increasingly hostile reaction of states and localities to unchecked and costly federal mandates, Congress in March 1995 enacted the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-4). The Act requires Congress to take into consideration the cost to states, localities, and Indian tribes of new mandates. Federal agencies must assess the impact of new regulations both on state, local, and tribal governments and on the private sector; and the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations is tasked with a review of existing mandates.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One year later, states already feel the relief from new unfunded mandates.<sup>11</sup>  Thanks to this legislation, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is tasked with estimating the costs of these new legislative mandates. Now many Members of Congress can find out the costs of proposed mandates and reduce the cost to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some examples of how these additional consultations and deliberations have resulted in important policy changes that saved hundreds of millions dollars:
<blockquote><p>
<b>Immigration.</b> The benefits of CBO's input were evident in the development of the immigration bill. Originally, the Senate bill required that all drivers' licenses without valid Social Security numbers would be invalid immediately upon the date of enactment of the law. CBO estimated that this would cost from $80 million-$200 million for states that would have to purchase new equipment and make other necessary changes to handle the volume of people who suddenly would need to have new licenses issued. <sup>12</sup> This provision was changed in the final legislation to allow for a six-year phase-in period during which states could renew licenses when they normally would come up for renewal. This dropped the costs to states to around $20 million.
<p>
<b>Agriculture.</b> The House version of the farm bill contained provisions that would require milk sold for fluid uses to contain greater amounts of nonfat solids than currently required and lock in higher fluid milk prices under the archaic Milk Marketing Order System. CBO estimated the direct costs of this provision to dairy processors and manufacturers at somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion annually. The final farm bill did not contain a national higher fluid milk standard, and CBO's estimates were used to help make the case for its elimination.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Health Care.</b> The Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill initially included a provision that would have required insurers to provide the same benefits for mental health coverage as for other illnesses, and the case for dropping this unjustified mandate was greatly facilitated by CBO estimates of the cost. The CBO noted that imposing this mandated benefit on private health insurance would have huge public and private sector costs. It projected that the Senate mandate would impose $423 million in additional costs on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) between 1996 and 2002, rising to $739 million by 2005. If it was applied to Medicare and Medicaid, program outlays would increase by almost $80 billion for Medicare between 1997 and 2000, and by another $35 billion for Medicaid during the same period. CBO also estimated that the premiums for traditional fee-for-service plans would increase by 5.3 percent, while managed care plans would see an increase of 4 percent.<sup>14</sup>  The costly provision was taken out of the bill.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The National Highway System Designation Act (P.L. 104-59)</b> ended a burdensome, costly unfunded mandate requiring states to satisfy a minimum tonnage utilization requirement for asphalt pavement containing recycled rubber on federal-aid projects. According to the CBO, the Federal Highway Administration estimates that states would save up to $1 billion annually in paving costs by not having to comply with the crumb rubber requirements.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Amendments to the 1990 Clean Air Act employee commute option (ECO) program (P.L. 104-70)</b> make the program optional for states if they can undertake alternative methods that will achieve equivalent emissions reductions. While the EPA had estimated the cost of the ECO program at $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion annually,<sup>16</sup> it also called the impact of the program "minuscule" because it proved to be relatively ineffective at achieving emission reductions.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act (P.L. 104-119)</b> exempts waste determined to be non-hazardous under the Clean Water Act or Safe Drinking Water Act from regulation under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, since chemical compounds safe enough to drink presumably are safe enough to bury. Municipal solid waste landfills likewise are exempt from ground water monitoring requirements if they are small (waste disposals of less than 20 tons daily).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Repeal of the federal speed limit.</b> As part of the National Highway system bill that President Clinton signed on November 28, 1995, the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit was repealed unconditionally. Beginning on December 8, 1995, states were able to begin freely adjusting speed limits within their boundaries. Several states immediately took action to raise their limits in response to the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996</b> Small businesses are the engine of economic growth in this country. For small business owners, Washington looms as "public enemy number one." Small businesses want to get government off their backs so they can do what they do best -- create jobs and generate tax revenue -- without the excessive burden of reporting and regulatory compliance.<sup>18</sup>  Regulation also does not affect all businesses equally. "One-size-fits-all" regulations impose the heaviest burden on small and medium-sized businesses because they find it harder to spread the high overhead costs of paperwork, attorney and accountant fees, and staff time needed to negotiate the federal regulatory maze.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In response to the concerns of small business, Congress passed the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-121), which was signed by the President on March 29, 1996. This legislation:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Authorizes judicial enforcement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, which requires agencies to provide information on the impact of their regulations on small businesses and other entities;
<p>
<li> Allows small business to recoup expenses and legal fees incurred when agencies make excessive demands for penalties that cannot be sustained in court;
<p>
<li> Provides for an independent ombudsman to receive confidential complaints from small businesses about their dealings with federal regulators; and
<p>
<li> Requires federal agencies to prepare "Plain English" compliance guides spelling out in easy-to-follow language how small businesses can comply with federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress deserves credit for this modest reform in the face of the Clinton Administration's overwhelming opposition to more fundamental reforms that small businesses desperately need. For example, President Clinton vetoed a number of important regulatory, tax, and legal reforms proposed by the 104th Congress that were important priorities not just for small businesses, but for all businesses so they can promote economic growth and create more jobs. These included environmental and workplace reform, secure property rights, a reform of outdated labor laws, repeal of Davis-Bacon, capital gains tax reduction, estate tax reform, tax equity in health care reform, pension reform, and tort reform.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995</b> More than one-third of the costs of regulation -- about $200 billion -- in 1995 was due to paperwork.<sup>19</sup>  Thus, even a modest reduction in the total paperwork burden imposed on the public can save Americans thousands of hours of time and hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in lost productivity. Most Americans fill out some kind of paperwork, such as federal tax forms or forms to obtain some type of government benefit. Businesses also must maintain a myriad of records to demonstrate compliance with environment, workplace, and other rules.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Intent on easing the burden imposed by the federal government on individuals and businesses, the 104th Congress voted overwhelmingly to pass the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-13), and President Clinton signed it into law on May 22, 1995. The Act further amended and recodified the original Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The new law sets a government-wide paperwork reduction goal of 10 percent in each of the first two years after its enactment, and 5 percent from FY 1998 through FY 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The General Accounting Office (GAO) recently released a report showing that the number of hours of paperwork imposed by the government rose by 500 million in the one-month period immediately before the effective date of the Act, from 6.39 billion hours on August 30, 1995, to 6.90 billion hours on September 30, 1995.<sup>20</sup>  The estimated burden imposed by OSHA rose the most dramatically, from 1.5 million hours to about 208 million hours.<sup>21</sup>  These significant increases were due to the fact that the new law forced agencies to more accurately acknowledge the level of paperwork burden they impose on the public.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The GAO projects that federal agencies are expected to reduce the paperwork burden by about one percent in FY 1996.<sup>22</sup>  For the first time since 1989, Congress has managed to force a decrease of as much as 70 million hours in the government paperwork burden. This is equivalent to allowing 36,350 people now working full-time on paperwork each year to engage in other, more productive activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Congressional Review Act of 1996</b> For too long, federal agencies have blamed Congress for many of the burdensome regulations it has crafted, and often this blame is justified. The 104th Congress now has made itself accountable and responsible to the American public for all regulations. The Congressional Review Act, part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, allows Congress to review each new rule and consider a joint resolution of disapproval to overrule it. Under this Act, no rule may go into effect until it is delivered to Congress for its review. A "rule" is defined very broadly to include all general agency statements that affect the public, including "interpretive" rules, agency "policy statements," "guidelines," and "staff manuals."  Federal agencies will have to report to Congress on each rule, stating whether they have evaluated the costs of the rule relative to the benefits, whether the rule takes private property, and whether it affects the relationship between the federal government and state and local governments. Congress can reject a rule, which would then have to be changed substantially before it could be resubmitted to Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
More reform would have been achieved had President Clinton not vetoed other measures passed by the 104th Congress. Among them:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>The Common Sense Liability Reform Act (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> The Act would have curbed abuses of the legal system. It had strong bipartisan backing in Congress but was vigorously opposed by the trial lawyers -- incidentally, among the largest contributors to Clinton's presidential campaign. Liability reform is desperately needed to reduce the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. Unfortunately, Congress did not have the votes necessary to override Clinton's veto of May 2, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> In September 1993, President Clinton had revised and reissued the regulatory review executive order first issued by President Reagan. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, established a set of principles to guide federal regulators in developing rules and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in reviewing rules. These principles include consideration of costs and benefits and the use of market-based alternatives and performance standards. The Clinton Administration, however, did not appear very committed to making sure the regulatory principles it embodied were being taken into consideration by federal agencies. A review of EPA rulemaking between April 1994 and September 1994 showed that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Of 45 significant rules reviewed by OMB, only six contained a determination that the benefits justified the costs; only three contained a determination of a compelling public need; and only nine considered alternative approaches to regulating. Of the other 177 EPA rules issued during that six-month period but not reviewed by OMB, no rule determined that the benefits justified the costs.<sup>23</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress recognized that for regulatory reform to be truly effective, it must force regulatory agencies to behave differently, and a statutory change was the only way to achieve it. Federal regulators needed to be required to base their decisions on costs, benefits, and actual risks faced by Americans, and they need Congress to give them the roadmap to do it. Congress enacted such legislation as part of a temporary increase in the debt ceiling. But President Clinton vetoed this bill on November 13, 1995.

<p>

<b>THE BAND-AID APPROACH: THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S "REGULATORY REINVENTION INITIATIVES" </b>
<p><blockquote>
<center>	I am going to stop handing down mandates to you and regulating you to death.</center>

<P>
--Bill Clinton, remarks before the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Houston, Texas, June 22, 1992.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Despite campaign promises to cut red tape, the growth of regulation has continued during the Clinton Administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
At the end of 1992, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the annual accumulation of all federal regulations in effect, filled 199 volumes and 128,344 pages. By the end of 1995, the CFR had grown to 205 volumes and 138,186 pages -- almost 10,000 pages of new executive branch rules in just three years.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
To be sure, soon after the 104th Congress took office, the Clinton Administration initiated a number of steps that made it look as if it was really serious about slowing the growth of new rules. For example, on February 21, 1995, the White House directed federal agencies to conduct a review of their existing regulations to determine which should be eliminated and which should be streamlined, updated, overhauled, or otherwise improved.<sup>25</sup>  However, one year later, it is clear the Administration is making no real progress in reducing the overall burden of regulation. For example:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In June 1995, the Administration claimed that agencies had identified over 16,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations that they would be eliminating.<sup>26</sup>  But some of the pages being eliminated are for rules for which the underlying statute has long since been repealed, treaties that no longer exist, and the like. This alone easily could achieve a 10 percent reduction in the CFR without accomplishing any real changes in the way the federal government goes about regulating the public. So while it sounds impressive, it is not. At the same time, the Administration already has added 10,000 pages of new regulations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
While EPA claims to be streamlining various permitting, review, and reporting requirements for a number of programs, the Clinton Administration simultaneously is pushing forward with burdensome regulatory initiatives, such as expanding the universe of sources that must be reported as part of the Toxic Release Inventory. Critics argue that last year's expansion will mean as much as $331 million in compliance costs.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Administration, while asserting that it is committed to sound science, is pursuing federal guidelines on cancer assessment to make it easier to regulate or ban substances despite the lack of sound scientific evidence that they pose any risk. Virtually all scientists who conduct statistical analyses to determine cancer risks -- or any other analyses, for that matter -- use confidence levels to determine the likelihood that their results are accurate. But the EPA proposed new rules this April that would eliminate the current requirement that EPA use confidence levels in doing risk assessments. Under this new rule, EPA would be able to conclude that something is dangerous on the basis of evidence that would fail under any rigorous scientific study.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is consolidating a few rules and eliminating duplicative pages in the Code of Federal Regulations, it also is working on new regulations that will impose over $12 billion in compliance costs on consumers and businesses (indoor air quality and ergonomics) and increase the cost of a home by $1,000 to $5,000 (fall protection).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Clearly, the Clinton Administration's "reinvention" effort does little to curb the rising costs and inefficiencies of regulation. The Administration claims to be reinventing regulation but goes about implementing new burdensome regulations about as fast as it can take old ones off the books.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When the 104th Congress began in January 1995, the federal government's ever-expanding reach into the lives of Americans -- the food they eat, how they use their private property, how they run their businesses -- was a source of great concern to the American people. The 104th Congress has made historic progress toward fundamentally changing how the federal government regulates the lives of all Americans. And it has done so by applying a set of principles: free markets, competition, consideration of costs and benefits, sound science and risk assessment, priority setting, and assigning of property rights.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Clinton Administration will now attempt to take credit for regulatory reform through its "reinvention" efforts, but all it actually has done is try to play "catch-up" by repackaging the same old regulatory system and passing it off as something new. Making it easier for businesses to comply with regulations that were unjustified in the first place or claiming to take away rules while simultaneously adding new ones does not represent true regulatory reform. The American people are too smart for that. In the final analysis, they know that true reform gives them more freedom and incentives to take actions for their own benefit, and that the 104th Congress has delivered on its promise in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulations for decades.

A Special Report to the House Banking and Financial Services Committee
<P>


<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 requires a number of government agencies--the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the General Accounting Office (GAO), the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)--to report on the feasibility and effects of privatizing the two largest housing-related government sponsored enterprises (GSEs): the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).
<p>

As these reports are being submitted to Congress,<sup>1</sup> the House subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities and Government Sponsored Enterprises is holding oversight hearings to study the issue of privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The hearings have highlighted the diverse opinions of the federal agencies on the advantages and disadvantages of privatization. Several of the academic studies and the Congressional Budget Office report indicate that federal sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provides stockholders with a significant subsidy that may indicate government sponsorship is unnecessary. On the other hand, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development both conclude that government sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continues to be necessary to preserve the mission and ensure the success of these GSEs.


<p>
Because of the divergent views among government agencies and outside experts on privatization, some observers are arguing that, even if the GSEs are not privatized, congressional oversight is inappropriate because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are legally private corporations and not government agencies. Thus, Congress now finds itself defending its oversight role as well as considering the option of privatization.
<p>

Although Congress will hear many different views on these issues, it must keep in mind  two important facts to help guide its decisions:
<ol>

<p><li><b>Congress is ultimately responsible for safeguarding the interests of taxpayers.</b> Congressional oversight of government sponsored enterprises is not only appropriate but indeed critical as long as GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac receive government subsidies, undertake a public mission, and place taxpayers at risk.

<p><li><b>The original mission of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, establishing an efficient secondary mortgage market, has been fulfilled.</b> Thus, Congress should take steps to end the relationship between these organizations and the federal government.
</ol><p>
<b>Congressional Oversight of GSEs Is Critical As Long As 
Taxpayers Are At Risk</b>
<p>

The structure and mission of government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) makes their relationship to the federal government and role in the economy ambiguous and at times risky. GSEs typically are stockholder-owned corporations, and therefore private, but chartered and overseen by the federal government, and therefore public. This dual personality can create a conflict between a GSE executive who is responsible for maximizing profit for the corporation's stockholders and the federal official whose duty is to ensure that the public mission of the corporation is met.
<p>

Because GSEs are private organizations responsible to their stockholders, they may view congressional oversight and investigations as intrusions into the internal affairs of their private business. At the same time, none of the GSEs want to lose the special privileges afforded them by federal charter and implicit government guarantees. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are active across the country and easily can mobilize broad-based support within Congress for favorable treatment. This is especially true when the topic of discussion is privatization.
<p>

However, there are several reasons why congressional oversight and investigation is important and necessary as long as GSEs remain under the umbrella of taxpayer support and protection. These include: 
<ul>
<p><li><b>The GSEs were chartered by Congress to fulfill a specific public policy goal.</b> In exchange for the government support enjoyed by GSEs--such as exemption from state and local taxes, the ability to borrow money from the federal treasury, and participation in Federal Reserve Open Market transactions--these private organizations are expected to fulfill a specific public policy goal. In the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, this goal is to make home mortgages more readily available by creating an efficient and fluid secondary mortgage market. Although this mission has been met, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continue to receive significant benefits from the federal government. It is necessary, therefore, to ensure that the GSEs do not use these benefits to stray from their original charters.

<p><li><b>The federal oversight agency can have conflicting roles as regulator and advocate, putting taxpayers at risk.</b>The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 created the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) to oversee the activities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Specifically, the OFHEO is required to establish minimal risk-based capital standards to be met by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These requirements limit the potential risk faced by taxpayers in the case of a serious failure. However, the risk-based capital requirements also have the effect of limiting the profitability of the GSEs by restricting the amount of productive investments that can be made at any one time. Therefore, the goals of advocacy and regulation can be in direct conflict. If the OFHEO chooses to lean toward advocacy rather than regulation, then taxpayer risk could increase.<sup>2</sup>  The Congressional Budget Office reports that "OFHEO's objective of minimizing risk is inconsistent with the current objective of using the GSEs to finance the achievement of social goals."<sup>3</sup> Thus, Congress also must oversee the activities of the OFHEO.

<p><li><b>Congress is ultimately responsible for avoiding a GSE failure that potentially could cost taxpayers billions of dollars.</b> Congress is responsible for protecting the interests of the American taxpayers. Taxpayers have a large vested interest in government sponsored enterprises and it is incumbent upon Congress to ensure that this interest is carefully protected.
</ul><p>
<b>Privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</b>
<p>

Privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would have a number of important economic benefits. In the short-term, the loss of an implicit government guarantee would increase the cost of business for GSEs, and it is likely that part of this increase would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher mortgage interest costs. In the long-run, however, the end of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's implicit government guarantee would create a more competitive secondary mortgage market. Increased competition would counter the loss of federal subsidies and help to keep mortgage costs down. Competition also would lead to greater innovation and hence more consumer choice. In addition, privatization would mean an end to taxpayer support and the mandate to achieve certain public policy objectives. Thus, the federal government's oversight role would end, and the GSEs would be free to exit existing lines of business and enter more profitable ones. 
<p>

Several important factors make privatization a viable and attractive option. These include:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have fulfilled their original mission; secondary mortgage markets are established and fluid.</b> There is a consensus that the secondary mortgage market in America is well established and fluid. In fact, each of the four studies mandated by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 concludes that an efficient secondary mortgage market exists today (see box). Along with other private firms, they would able to take advantage of the established market without posing a threat to taxpayers. </ul>
<table border>

<tr><td><b>BY ALL ACCOUNTS, TODAY'S SECONDARY MORTGAGE MARKET IS ESTABLISHED AND FLUID</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>"The secondary market now provides an efficient, stable, and dependable source of liquidity for mortgage credit markets."<sup>4</sup> - <I>U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</I><p>

"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have succeeded in developing a liquid secondary mortgage market for conforming, conventional mortgages. ... There seems little doubt that securitization and the secondary mortgage activities pioneered by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac are now well-established and that the secondary market for conforming, conventional mortgages could operate efficiently and effectively even if Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's government sponsorship were altered."<sup>5</sup> -  <I>U.S. Department of the Treasury</I>
<p>
 "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have played critical roles in establishing and maintaining a nationwide secondary mortgage market, enhancing the affordability and availability of housing finance, and increasing efficiency through greater standardization of mortgage products and processes."<sup>6</sup> - <I>General Accounting Office</I>
<p>
"From a perspective of financing mortgages, the good news is that access to mortgage funds has increased."<sup>7</sup> - <I>Congressional Budget Office</I>
</td></tr></table>
<ul><p>

<p><li><b>There is no rationale for further government intervention in the mortgage credit markets.</b> Fannie Mae was created in 1938 in an attempt to increase the availability of affordable home mortgages. At that time, technological shortcomings and a Depression-era private economy prevented the widespread availability of home mortgages. Even in 1970, when Freddie Mac was chartered, an efficient secondary market was an illusive goal. However, today technology and more fluid capital markets have increased the availability of mortgages to all potential home buyers. 
<p>
Indeed, the development and efficiency of the home mortgage markets in America is, at least in part, a credit to the activities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. After having met their original goals, however, these GSEs are now involved in activities that relate only tangentially to their original missions. The Congressional Budget Office reports, "Having achieved their original purpose, the housing GSEs can now cite the authority to undertake a large number of tasks whose precise nature is not always clearly defined."<sup>8</sup>  The expansion of activities undertaken by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac indicates that they have fulfilled their original public policy mission. These expanded activities also pose new risks to the taxpayers.
<p>

<li><b>The tremendous size of the housing GSEs, which is made possible only by implicit federal guarantee,  presents a dangerous presence in the capital markets.</b> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac together have more than $1.4 trillion in debt and mortgage-backed securities. This is equivalent to nearly two-fifths of the publicly held federal government debt.<sup>9</sup>  Together the two housing GSEs purchase more than 50 percent of all conforming mortgages.<sup>10</sup>  By any measure, then, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are "800-pound gorillas" in the capital markets. This tremendous size is made possible only by the distinct advantages enjoyed by the organizations as government sponsored enterprises.
<p>
The advantages enjoyed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their enormous size present several dangers to the credit markets in general and the mortgage markets specifically. Private firms cannot compete with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.<sup>11</sup> The federal government, in essence, has created a duopoly that hinders innovation and prevents consumers from obtaining the most efficient delivery of home mortgages. Moreover, in the case of a GSE failure, the mortgage credit market would be severely crippled because of the lack of participants able to fill the void left by such a primary participant.
<p>
In addition, the large number of transactions carried out by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have significant effects on other credit markets. Demand for mortgages is abnormally high because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are able to borrow money in the credit markets at a subsidized rate. This subsidy is partially passed on to consumers, who will forego other investment activities when faced with a lower mortgage price. In fact, residential structures today represent nearly 30 percent of total tangible wealth in the United States. This figure has slowly been rising over the past two decades. Government distortion of the capital markets means that natural demands within other sectors--such as small business loans, consumer loans, and farm loans--are not being fully met. This distortion may have a long-term impact on the strength of the American economy as more capital is diverted away from productive business activities and into home ownership.
<p>
<p><li><b>The mixed private/public nature of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac constitutes a conflict of interest.</b> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are stockholder-owned companies. As such, they are responsible for earning the highest possible profits for their shareholders. In the private market this would be completely acceptable. However, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are accountable for meeting several public goals that may conflict with their private incentive to earn a maximum profit. If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac vigorously pursue their private goals, then the public mission is lost and taxpayers are placed in jeopardy. On the other hand, stockholders are denied a maximum rate of return if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pursue their public missions too vigorously. This conflict between public and private interests will continue as long as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain government sponsored, but structurally private, enterprises.
<p>
Fannie Mae admits that the value of its stock depends largely on federal government subsidies. Responding to one of the five academic studies prepared for Congress, Fannie Mae writes, "[I]f shareholders are not compensated fully, they will likely claim that privatization constitutes an appropriation of private property without just compensation in violation of the Due Process or the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment."<sup>12</sup> Thus, even Fannie Mae recognizes that the current structure of the housing GSEs constitutes a transfer of wealth from the entire pool of taxpayers to the relatively small number of GSE stockholders. As in all areas of government, such a transfer is highly suspect.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The reports mandated by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act and the current congressional hearings represent a positive step in addressing the need for and appropriateness of federal interference in the financial markets. Congress has a responsibility to oversee the ongoing activities of all GSEs, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as long as American taxpayers provide support and assume risk for GSE activities.
<p>

With their original goal of a comprehensive and fluid secondary mortgage market fulfilled, however, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac no longer require government support. Increasingly, housing GSEs are venturing into new areas of operation that pose a significant threat to taxpayers. With the job done, Congress should break the links between Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the federal government and completely turn these profitable operations over to the private sector.

<b>ENDNOTES</b>
<ol>
<p><li> CBO and GAO have submitted their reports and testified before Congress on their findings. In addition, five academic studies also have been submitted to various agencies and Congress. The Treasury Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development are expected to report their findings later this month.
<p><li> In fact, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac already enjoy a lower mandated capital to asset ratio (a prime indicator of financial institution stability) than commercial banks and thrift institutions. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac typically maintain a capital to asset ratio of 3.5 percent and 4.9 percent respectively. The average commercial bank ratio is 7.8 percent and the average private thrift maintains a ratio of 7.9 percent. Several analysts have pointed out that these relatively low capital to asset ratios pose a potential threat to the solvency of the GSEs.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the most important fiscal policy debates developing in this election involves the question of whether changes in tax policy have "supply-side" effects. In other words, will lower tax rates increase economic growth, resulting in more jobs, higher wages, and bigger profits?  If the answer is yes -- meaning that lower tax rates cause taxable income to rise -- it is reasonable to argue that a tax cut will be at least partially self-financing. The extent to which increased revenue from a bigger tax base helps offset the revenue loss from lower tax rates then becomes an empirical question. This is what "static" versus "dynamic" scoring is all about. Static analysis assumes that tax changes have no impact on economic growth, meaning no increases in revenue; dynamic analysis recognizes that taxes do affect the economy. Unfortunately, government estimators use a static approach.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The battle over revenue-estimating methodology may seem an esoteric, inside-the-Beltway issue, but it has important implications. Politicians generally favor tax cuts, but they do not relish voting for higher deficits and certainly are loathe to approve offsetting savings from the spending side of the budget. Dynamic scoring, assuming it is used properly, can facilitate sound tax policy by reducing the politically "unpleasant" side-effects of tax cuts.<sup>1</sup>  In the short term, a proper understanding of the importance of dynamic scoring would make it easier either to repeal the 1990 and 1993 tax hikes or to provide an across-the-board reduction in tax rates.<sup>2</sup>  In the long term, the move to a flat tax would be expedited if dynamic scoring were used to allow the lowest possible rate.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because dynamic scoring would make tax rate reductions more attractive, it is understandable that those who oppose tax cuts want to maintain the current system of static scoring. An objective examination of the historical evidence, however, demonstrates that dynamic scoring gives policymakers more accurate information.<sup>3</sup>  When taking steps to modernize the revenue-estimating process, policymakers should consider the following points:<ul><p><li><b>Learn from history.</b> Static scoring routinely overestimates how much revenue will be generated by tax increases. The 1990 luxury tax, the income tax rate increases of 1990 and 1993, and the 1986 capital gains tax rate increase are all examples in which revenues fell far short of static predictions. By contrast, the 1981 Reagan tax cuts, the 1978 capital gains tax reduction, the Kennedy tax cuts of the 1960s, and the 1986 Tax Reform Act all demonstrate how pro-growth tax changes will generate revenue feedback.<sup>4</sup><p><li><b>Don't make the perfect the enemy of the good.</b> It is impossible to predict all the effects of any single change in government policy. The fact that dynamic scoring cannot pinpoint all the multiyear effects of a change in tax policy, however, is not an argument for maintaining a static process guaranteed to give an answer that is wrong and farther from the truth.

<P><LI><B>Not all tax cuts are created equal.</b> The higher the tax rate, the bigger the supply-side response when the rate is reduced. Likewise, reducing tax rates on capital income, which is more easily controlled by the taxpayer, will have a greater impact than similar tax reductions on labor income. And some tax cuts, such as credits, will have little or no revenue feedback effects since incentives to engage in productive behavior remain unchanged.<sup>5</sup><p><li><b>Open the process to public scrutiny.</b> Even though they are the ones who pay the bills, taxpayers today are not allowed to examine the static models and methodology used by revenue estimators at the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Treasury Department. Whether or not the revenue-estimating process is improved, policymakers should insist on full disclosure. If policymakers adopt dynamic scoring, an open process will keep the system honest by inhibiting those who are tempted to exaggerate the benefits of tax cuts.

<p><li><b>The goal of tax policy is to maximize growth, not tax revenues.</b> For years, budget deficits have played a big role in the political debate. As a result, some tax policy proposals, such as reductions in the capital gains tax, are judged primarily by their effect on tax collections. This myopic approach inevitably interferes with sound tax policy and should be discarded.

<p><li><b>Include estimates of private and governmental compliance costs.</b> According to the Tax Foundation, the current tax system imposes $225 billion in compliance costs on the productive sector of the economy.<sup>6</sup>  In addition to these private costs of lawyers, lobbyists, accountants, tax preparers, and lost man-hours, about $13 billion in direct government expenditures is associated with taxation.<sup>7</sup>  Yet revenue estimators confess that "staff does not estimate the administrative costs incurred by either the IRS or taxpayers that may result from proposed legislation."<sup>8</sup></ul><p><b>WHAT IS STATIC SCORING, AND WHO DOES IT?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are two official sources of revenue estimates in Washington. The Administration uses the Office of Tax Analysis (OTA), which is part of the Treasury Department, and Congress uses the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). Both use static scoring, though it is important to define the term.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Static scoring does not mean there is absolutely no recognition that taxpayers might modify their behavior in response to changes in tax policy. Defenders of the status quo thus argue that dynamic effects are incorporated into revenue forecasts. To a limited extent, they are right.<sup>9</sup>  If asked to estimate the revenue impact of a change in the gasoline tax, for instance, the current process attempts to measure the degree to which the change in the tax will affect the amount of gasoline purchased. Likewise, changes in income tax rates will include some calculation of tax avoidance behavior.<sup>10</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Missing from the equation, however, is any effort to capture the revenue effects caused by changes in macroeconomic variables. Revenue estimators assume that economic growth, job creation, and income will remain unchanged, regardless of how much taxes are reduced or increased. The Treasury Department's Office of Tax Analysis, for example, in a 1995 analysis of the flat tax wrote that:
<blockquote>
	no attempt is made to estimate the tax-induced behavioral responses of either individuals or corporations. Following the standard revenue estimating conventions used by both the Office of Tax Analysis and the Joint Committee on Taxation, the macroeconomic aggregates, such as the level of compensation, prices, employment, and gross domestic product, have been assumed to be unchanged by the proposal.<sup>11</sup></blockquote><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These assumptions effectively require the Treasury Department and the Joint Committee on Taxation to ignore the real world. This may be a reasonable approach for minor alterations of the tax code,<sup>12</sup> but it certainly produces inaccurate answers when examining significant changes. Thus, if asked to predict what would happen if tax rates were doubled, for instance, revenue estimators would assume that tax collections, with some minor modifications, would double as well. Some may think this is an exaggeration, but consider the actions of the Joint Committee on Taxation. In 1988, Senator Robert Packwood (R-OR), ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, asked the JCT to estimate the revenue impact if the government confiscated all income over $200,000 annually.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The revenue estimators at JCT responded that such a tax would raise $104 billion the first year, $204 billion the second year, $232 billion the third year, and $263 billion and $299 billion in the fourth and fifth years, respectively.<sup>13</sup>  As Senator Packwood noted, however, this view of the world is impractical because it "assumes people will work if they have to pay all their money to the Government. They will work forever and pay all of the money to the Government when clearly anyone in their right mind will not."<sup>14</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To be fair, the revenue estimators are not really the ones at fault.<sup>15</sup>  The decision to modernize and improve the scoring process will have to come from the top. At the Office of Tax Analysis, presidentially appointed officials at the Treasury Department are the only ones with the power to authorize this change. On Capitol Hill, this power lies with the Members of Congress who serve on the Joint Committee on Taxation, particularly the Chairman and Vice-Chairman. Indeed, the JCT has set up a Revenue Estimating Advisory Board to explore "ways to improve the estimating process and estimating methodology."<sup>16</sup><p><b>WHAT IS DYNAMIC SCORING?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In simple terms, dynamic scoring means that estimates would be designed to capture revenue effects from changes in overall economic conditions. Instead of deliberately ignoring these variables, as is the convention today, revenue estimators would predict whether a change in policy would be likely to affect the level of compensation, prices, employment, and gross domestic product (GDP). If there is an effect on one or more of these variables, they would then calculate the amount of revenue feedback or loss.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How would this work?  Take the example of the 15 percent across-the-board tax cut proposed some weeks ago by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI). Static revenue estimates reportedly show this proposal reducing tax revenues by about $500 billion over a six-year period.<sup>17</sup>  If such a proposal boosted the economy's rate of growth by one-half of one percentage point over the same period, however, Congressional Budget Office sensitivity tables (designed to measure the effects of selected economic changes on budget projections) indicate that $170 billion of that loss would be recouped in the form of revenue feedback and lower interest costs. Administration figures show the feedback would be more than $200 billion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As shown in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090t1.gif">Table 1</a>, both the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) agree that faster growth helps reduce the budget deficit. These numbers work both ways, incidentally, with slower growth boosting the budget deficit. The key questions are whether a change in tax policy will promote growth and, if so, by how much.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Contrary to popular wisdom, dynamic scoring does not mean that tax cuts pay for themselves. The degree of revenue feedback depends on what tax rate is being reduced and by what amount. Only in extremely rare circumstances is it believed that a tax rate reduction will generate enough economic activity to offset all of the revenue loss associated with the lower rate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c1.gif">Chart 1</a>, popularly known as the Laffer curve, illustrates this principle. A zero rate tax will stimulate considerable growth but, by definition, collects no revenue. A 100 percent tax rate also generates no revenue, however, because it eliminates all incentive to earn income -- not to mention what happens to the rest of the economy. What happens, though, if the government imposes a tax rate of, say, 10 percent?  With a low, flat rate, almost all taxpayers presumably will continue to work, so the government will collect one-tenth of the income earned. As tax rates rise, however, taxpayers gradually become discouraged and reduce their earnings. As long as tax rates are not excessive, the increase in revenue associated with the higher tax rate exceeds the revenue loss caused by lower levels of income. At some point, however, the tax rate reaches a revenue-maximizing level. Any efforts to raise tax rates beyond this level will reduce revenues because of the fall in taxable income.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Tragically, there are some taxes in America that fall on the wrong side of the Laffer curve. These include:<ul>

<p><li><b>Income tax rates on the rich.</b> Wealthy taxpayers are particularly sensitive to high tax rates. Not only can they afford the best tax lawyers, accountants, and financial planners, but they also receive most of their income in the form of dividends, interest, capital gains, and other business income (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). When tax rates become too onerous, these taxpayers can shift their assets to tax-free status, move their money offshore, or take other steps to alter the timing or composition of their income.<sup>18</sup>  According to recent research by James Poterba of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, lower tax rates on the richest 0.5 percent would generate higher rather than lower tax revenues.<sup>19</sup>

<p><li><b>Estate taxes.</b> The government confiscates 55 percent of a person's assets in excess of $4 million upon death.<sup>20</sup>  Those smart enough to build up businesses and portfolios of this value, however, typically are also smart enough to protect their families' wealth from the government.<sup>21</sup>  Thus, even though the estate tax collects about $15 billion annually, it is estimated that the government loses money because of reduced income tax collections caused by aggressive estate planning (which occurs in the years prior to death when wealthy taxpayers transfer funds, cease working, set up trusts, give to charity, and take other steps to reduce the tax value of their assets).<sup>22</sup><p><li><b>Capital gains taxes.</b> Revenue estimators from both Congress and the Administration acknowledge that lower capital gains taxes will boost sales (or realizations) of stock, bonds, real estate, and other assets. This "unlocking effect," by itself, may be large enough to produce a net revenue increase.<sup>23</sup>  Unfortunately, both the JCT and the OTA fail to calculate the impact of lower capital gains taxes on economic growth. If the revenue estimates included the effects of higher growth, they almost surely would show a significant revenue gain.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tax rates that are so punitive that they actually lose revenue certainly should be reduced. The lower rate would please conservatives who favor economic growth, and should please liberals who want the government to collect more money.<sup>24</sup>  It is important to recognize, however, that there is a huge difference between the revenue-maximizing tax rate and the growth-maximizing tax rate. Largely because of hefty value-added taxes (a form of national sales tax), many countries in Europe take a much higher percentage of their citizens' money than America does.<sup>25</sup>  These nations may be near the revenue-maximizing point of the Laffer curve, but it comes at a heavy price. European countries, compared to the United States, suffer from higher unemployment, slower growth, larger budget deficits, and lower incomes.

<p>

<b>HISTORICAL EXAMPLES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The strong theoretical argument for dynamic scoring is augmented by a great deal of historical evidence. The United States has experienced significant shifts in tax policy over the years, and the historical record both demonstrates the shortcomings of static analysis and provides ample proof that the revenue-estimating process should be modernized.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Before looking at specific examples, however, it may be useful to look at the broad picture. As <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c3.gif">Chart 3</a> illustrates, tax revenues traditionally have consumed about 19 percent of America's economic output.<sup>26</sup>  This relationship has been remarkably stable even though tax rates have shifted by large amounts. At times, the top income tax rate has exceeded 90 percent, while at other times it has fallen to less than 30 percent. The chart also shows income tax collections as a percentage of GDP. As is the case with total tax revenues, income tax collections are remarkably stable, hovering between 8 percent and 9 percent. The only two times they reached 9.4 percent or more, in 1969 and 1981, the economy fell into recession.<sup>27</sup><p><b>The Tax Cuts of the 1920s.</b> Tax rates were slashed dramatically during the 1920s, falling from 73 percent to 24 percent.<sup>28</sup>  The economy boomed, growing at an average annual rate of 6 percent between 1921 and 1929.<sup>29</sup>  Personal income tax revenues increased substantially, rising from $719 million in 1921 to $1,160 million in 1928.<sup>30</sup>  This 61 percent increase in revenue occurred at a time of no inflation. As <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c4.gif">Chart 4</a> shows, the percentage of the tax burden borne by the rich jumped dramatically, climbing from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928. These results, not surprisingly, would not have been predicted by static analysis.<p><b>The Kennedy Tax Cuts.</b> Lower taxes on savings and investment were approved in 1962, followed by across-the-board tax rate reductions in 1964. Economic growth picked up, with GDP increasing at an average annual rate of 5 percent between 1961 and 1968.<sup>31</sup>  The Kennedy tax cuts triggered the longest expansion in America's history, and revenues grew by 62 percent over the seven-year period.<sup>32</sup>  One of the most compelling pieces of supply-side evidence is the way different income groups responded to lower tax rates. As seen in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c5.gif">Chart 5</a>, wealthy taxpayers wound up paying significantly more tax revenues after their tax rates were reduced -- exactly as dynamic forecasting would have predicted.
<p>
<b>The 1978 Capital Gains Tax Cut.</b> The more control a taxpayer has over a taxable activity, the more pronounced the supply-side effect. Capital gains taxes are the best example of this phenomenon since a taxpayer can avoid the tax by not selling assets. In 1968, legislation was approved raising the capital gains tax from 25 percent to 49 percent. (Effective tax rates almost always were higher--sometimes over 100 percent -- since the government did not, and still does not, allow taxpayers to adjust asset prices for inflation.) Not surprisingly, capital gains revenues were sluggish throughout the 1970s. In 1978, however, the rate was reduced to 28 percent.<sup>33</sup>  The very next year, revenues jumped 45 percent.<sup>34</sup>  Capital gains tax revenues continued to rise, climbing even more when the Reagan tax cuts lowered the rate even further, down to 20 percent in 1981.<p>
<b>Windfall Profits Tax.</b> During the Carter Administration, a heavy tax was imposed on crude oil. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in 1979 that the tax would collect $184.5 billion between 1980 and 1985. But it brought in just $77.7 billion.<sup>35</sup>  To be fair, the huge revenue gap probably was due to President Reagan's decision to decontrol oil prices, something the JCT could not have predicted in 1979. At the same time, however, foreknowledge of this move may have caused the revenue estimators to make an even bigger mistake, since most liberals believed that restoring competition to the petroleum market would cause oil prices to skyrocket.<sup>36</sup><p><b>The Reagan Tax Cuts.</b> Campaigning on across-the-board tax cuts, Ronald Reagan took office at a time when the economy was in horrible shape. The economy was in the middle of a severe double-dip recession. Inflation was running at double-digit rates, unemployment was rising, and interest rates had climbed to more than 20 percent.<sup>37</sup>  Critics claimed the tax cuts would be inflationary and would do nothing to boost growth, but just the opposite happened. Americans did not receive a net tax cut until sometime between July 1982 and January 1983 because previously legislated payroll tax increases and bracket creep offset the portions of the tax cut that took effect in 1981 and 1982.<sup>38</sup>  Once the tax cuts did take effect, the longest peacetime economic expansion in the nation's history began.<sup>39</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The most comprehensive analysis of the revenue effect of the Reagan tax cuts shows two things: The lower tax rates on the rich more than paid for themselves, and there were substantial feedback effects from lower tax rates on other income classes as well (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c6.gif">Chart 6</a>). Defenders of high tax rates condemn the Reagan program, noting that tax revenues in the early 1980s were well below the Administration's original projections.<sup>40</sup>  But this reasoning is seriously flawed. First, it blames the tax cuts for the second half of the double-dip recession of 1980-1982, a drop in the economy that began before the economy received a tax cut. Second, it fails to recognize the irony that two-thirds of the revenue shortfall occurred because inflation was reduced much faster than was originally thought.<sup>41</sup>  Significantly, the forecast of the Democrat-controlled Congressional Budget Office closely matched the Administration's.<sup>42</sup><p><b>The 1986 Tax Reform Act.</b> This legislation provides one of the best examples of why dynamic forecasting is needed. The Tax Reform Act lowered tax rates on individual income and increased the tax burden on corporate income.<sup>43</sup>  According to the static estimates, the shift in taxes amounted to more than $100 billion over the five-year period. Actual tax collections, however, showed a very clear and pronounced supply-side effect. As taxpayers responded to lower rates, individual income tax revenues grew faster than expected, nearly 6 percent above projections. The higher tax burden on corporate income, meanwhile, had the opposite effect. Corporate income tax receipts were very sluggish, falling nearly 25 percent below the static estimates.<sup>44</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The divergent responses of personal and corporate income tax collections are critical. Defenders of static forecasting always try to argue that the dynamic effects are a coincidence. The booming economy and rapid revenue growth of the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s, for instance, are said to have had nothing to do with lower tax rates. Likewise, the economy's poor performance during the 1930s, 1970s, and 1990s is said to be just bad fortune completely unrelated to higher tax rates. These arguments fall apart when analyzing the Tax Reform Act, since it is impossible to blame sluggish corporate tax collections on a weak economy while at the same time claiming that strong personal tax collections are the result of a strong economy.
<p>
<b>The 1986 Capital Gains Tax Rate Increase.</b> As part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, policymakers increased the capital gains tax from 20 percent to 28 percent. Two noteworthy things happened. Capital gains realizations (asset sales) and revenues soared before the tax rate increase took effect and then collapsed by more than 50 percent when the higher rate took effect.<sup>45</sup>  When the Congressional Budget Office put together its revenue baseline in 1990, however, it assumed that capital gains realizations would grow at the same rate they did during the early 1980s when the tax rate was low. This proved to be a huge error. In fact, the high capital gains tax discouraged asset sales, and realizations were stagnant, usually less than half of CBO's projections.<sup>46</sup>  Moreover, the Joint Committee on Taxation used this inflated baseline in 1990 to put together static revenue estimates suggesting that a reduction in the rate would lose money and primarily benefit the wealthy. But the 1986 increase in the capital gains tax rate actually hurt middle-income taxpayers more than the rich, since the tax rate on their gains rose from 14 percent to 28 percent.<sup>47</sup><p><b>The Luxury Tax.</b> The 1990 budget agreement included provisions imposing excise taxes on products thought to be purchased by the "rich," including luxury boats and private airplanes. These taxes backfired so badly that Congress repealed them. Actual collections from the boat tax reached $32.5 million, according to the Treasury Department, far below the $53 million originally forecast.<sup>48</sup>  The Joint Committee on Taxation, meanwhile, admitted that the airplane tax collected just 10 percent of the static estimate.<sup>49</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Defenders of the tax have tried to argue that the revenue shortfall was coincidental,<sup>50</sup> but the actual effects are even worse than these numbers indicate. When boat builders lost their jobs and boatyards shut down, the federal government lost income and payroll taxes and also had to pay out unemployment benefits.<sup>51</sup>  The static estimates recognized that some people might have lost jobs as a result of the tax but assumed that those workers would immediately get jobs someplace else paying the same wage.<sup>52</sup>  Life in the real world, unfortunately, does not operate as flawlessly as these static blackboard models.<p><b>The Bush Tax Rate Increase.</b> In 1990, President Bush reneged on his no-new-taxes promise and signed into law a major tax increase, including an increase in the top rate from 28 percent to 31 percent. Rather than bring in new revenues, however, the government began to collect less revenue than was projected before tax rates were increased.<sup>53</sup>  In 1991 alone, revenues fell by more than $6 for every $1 the tax increase was supposed to generate.<sup>54</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Defenders of static scoring admit this happened but blame the stagnant economy for the drop in revenues. Since the tax increase certainly helped throw the economy into the tank, however, this excuse rings hollow. Even if one accepts the unlikely assumption that the tax increase had nothing to do with the recession, there are other compelling numbers showing the dynamic effect. In 1991, income tax receipts from those making more than $200,000 fell by more than 6 percent.<sup>55</sup>  Yet tax collections from those making less than that rose by 1 percent. In other words, the government wound up collecting less in revenue from the taxpayers who were slapped with higher tax rates, but collecting more from those whose taxes did not go up.
<p>
<b>The 1993 Clinton Tax Rate Increase.</b> Without a vote to spare in either the House or the Senate, President Clinton during his first year in office imposed the largest tax increase in history. His increase in tax rates, from 31 percent to 39.6 percent,<sup>56</sup> was the biggest jump since Herbert Hoover boosted the rate from 25 percent to 63 percent in 1930. Harvard economist Martin Feldstein estimates that the tax rate increase raised only one-third of the promised revenue.<sup>57</sup>  The combined effect of the Bush and Clinton tax rate increases has been an utter failure. As shown in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c7.gif">Chart 7</a>, revenues from the personal income tax actually have declined as a percentage of economic output since Reagan left office.<sup>58</sup><p><b>REVENUE ESTIMATES AND THE FLAT TAX</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The perils and pitfalls of static forecasting are clearly evident in the flat tax debate. Representative Richard Armey (R-TX) resuscitated the idea of moving to a simple and fair one-rate tax system in 1994. Almost immediately, the proposal was attacked by the Administration. Shortly before the mid-term elections that year, the press reported a Treasury Department estimate that the flat tax would require a rate of 25.8 percent to be revenue neutral.<sup>59</sup>  Six months later, the Administration criticized the flat tax yet again, but this time charged that the rate would have to be 22.9 percent to avoid increasing the deficit.<sup>60</sup>  More recently, the Treasury Department issued its third static estimate of the flat tax, this time claiming that the revenue neutral rate would be 20.8 percent.<sup>61</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Clinton Administration's inability to settle on a single rate is instructive for two reasons. It demonstrates that even static revenue estimates, which involve more simplistic calculations, are far from exact. Even more important, the White House inadvertently has provided compelling evidence for the flat tax. The Treasury Department's most recent estimate, predicting a revenue neutral rate of 20.8 percent, is still exaggerated.<sup>62</sup>  But it confirms that Representative Armey's 20 percent flat tax, which includes $40 billion in budgetary savings,<sup>63</sup> is deficit-neutral -- even using static analysis.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not surprisingly, dynamic estimates of the flat tax, using more sophisticated econometric and modeling techniques, find that growth increases significantly. This additional growth, as illustrated earlier, results in substantial revenue increases. An important question, of course, is who benefits from the economy's expansion. Representative Armey and Senate co-sponsor Richard Shelby (R-AL) believe that taxpayers should reap the benefit of faster growth. As a result, they reduce the flat rate to 17 percent in the third year.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Numerous studies support the contention that the economy will expand dramatically if the existing tax code is replaced by a single-rate flat tax. For example:<UL>

<p><li>Professor Dale Jorgenson, Chairman of the Economics Department at Harvard, testified before the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform that a single-rate system could boost the economy by 15 percent or more within a decade.<sup>64</sup><p><li>University of California professor Alan Auerbach, formerly an economist with the Joint Committee on Taxation, estimates that the economy would be 5.7 percent larger within five years with a flat tax.<sup>65</sup><p><li>Stanford University economist Michael Boskin, a former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has testified that a flat tax would boost growth by 10 percent within ten years.<sup>66</sup><p><li>Even without growth effects, two former Treasury Department economists estimate that a flat tax would be revenue neutral at 17 percent.<sup>67</sup><p><li>Boston University economist Laurence J. Kotlikoff estimates that a move to a single-rate tax that does not double-tax capital income would raise living standards by between 7 percent and 14 percent.<sup>68</sup><p><li>A study by two academic economists found that a 17 percent flat tax would boost growth so much that tax revenues would increase by 1.8 percentage points.<sup>69</sup></ul><p><b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT DYNAMIC SCORING</b><p><b><i>Q: Will lower tax rates reduce the underground economy, and will dynamic forecasting reflect this shift?</i><p>A:</b> Yes, but probably not enough to affect revenue forecasts. By definition, measuring the size of the underground economy is difficult. Those that have tried have produced estimates ranging from a low of 5 percent of GDP to a high of more than 25 percent of GDP.<sup>70</sup>  An added problem is that no one knows how much of the underground economy exists for the purpose of evading taxes. It is safe to assume that most drug dealers, bookies, and prostitutes do not pay taxes, but that will not change if tax rates are lowered. For activities that are legal, however, lower tax rates would reduce tax evasion. The American Bar Association conducted a three-year study which concluded that lower tax rates encourage greater compliance.<sup>71</sup><p><b><i>Q: What safeguards would be needed to ensure that the party in power did not abuse dynamic forecasts?</i><p>A:</b> This is a legitimate concern. Politicians often exaggerate the benefits of legislation they support, and it does not take a wild imagination to envision revenue estimators pressured to produce excessively optimistic numbers. The Congressional Budget Office, for instance, was often accused of tailoring its figures to help the Democrats when they were in the majority.<sup>72</sup>  This is why public disclosure of the model and methodology is so important. If outside experts were allowed to review all decisions, the potential for mischief would shrink dramatically.<sup>73</sup><p><b><i>Q: Should there be dynamic forecasts of spending legislation?</i><p>A:</b> If the scientific evidence is clear, the answer is yes. Considerable research has been done to show that government spending, particularly for consumption items, is a drag on economic growth.<sup>74</sup><p>Incorporating this new research into budget analysis would help policymakers make proper decisions. As with dynamic scoring of tax legislation, full disclosure is critical. The Congressional Budget Office, for instance, used a version of dynamic scoring during the debate over the 1995 Balanced Budget Act. Unfortunately, in predicting dramatic reductions in interest rates following enactment of legislation to reduce budget deficits,<sup>75</sup> the CBO was almost surely wrong.<sup>76</sup>  If the CBO had to publish its analyses and defend them before outside experts, estimators would be forced to refine and improve their techniques.<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During the post-Reagan years, the economy has experienced its worst seven-year performance since the end of World War II.<sup>77</sup>  The average family has lost more than $2,000 of real purchasing power,<sup>78</sup> and there is little reason for optimism about the future. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that economic growth over the next ten years will average only 2.1 percent if current tax and spending policies are maintained.<sup>79</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America can do better. From the end of World War II until the end of the Reagan years, the economy's growth rate averaged well over 3 percent -- and that includes recession years.<sup>80</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To get America growing again, tax policy will have to change. In the short term, immediate tax rate reductions are needed to boost growth; in the long term, the entire tax code should be replaced by a simple, flat tax. Unfortunately, these pro-growth changes will be harder to achieve if revenue estimators continue to use outdated and inaccurate static models. Dynamic revenue estimates, by contrast, would provide policymakers with more accurate information. Dynamic forecasting is based on a proper understanding of how the economy works, and history has shown this approach to be far more realistic.

<p><li>     It is conventional wisdom that voting for lower spending is bad politics. This fear may or may not be justified, but it certainly is true that lower spending is good economics. Ideally, lawmakers would want to reduce both taxes and spending as part of an overall effort to boost growth and enhance freedom.<p><li>    Harvard Professor Martin Feldstein, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, estimates that repeal of the higher tax rates approved in 1993 would result in a revenue loss of less than $10 billion, or less than one-third of the static estimate. For further detail, see Martin Feldstein, "The Case for Dynamic Analysis," <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, December 14, 1994.
   <p><li> Somewhat startlingly, an opponent of tax rate reductions admitted recently that the revenue feedback effect of lower tax rates was 35 percent. See Lawrence Chimerine, "Return of the Supply-Siders," <i>The Washington Post</i>, July 23, 1996.

 <p><li>   When estimating the effect of higher tax rates in 1993, the JCT examined several non-macroeconomic factors, such as "shifting from investments which yield interest and dividend income, taxed at the new higher rates, into investments that provide capital appreciation, which is taxed at unchanged lower rates. Also considered were shifts from taxable to tax-exempt assets, conversion to C corporation business form, conversion of wage income into tax-deferred compensation or tax-exempt fringe benefits, and increased noncompliance and avoidance." All these factors, however, only reduced the pure static revenue loss by 7 percent over the five-year period.

When Senator Packwood made a similar request in 1994, the committee responded by reporting the amount of after-tax income over $200,000 while noting that "If the 100-percent tax rate were to be in effect for a substantial period of time, so that taxpayers would have no rational hope of avoiding or evading the 100-percent tax in the outyears by deferring income to lower rate years or using other tax avoidance or deferral plans, then in our judgment there would be a substantial reduction in income-producing activity in the economy and, thus, a significant reduction in tax receipts to the Federal government."

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress soon will be considering major legislation that would enable poor children to attend the schools of their choice. Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and James Talent (R-MO) have introduced a comprehensive legislative initiative, Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3467:">H.R. 3467</a>).<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Title II, the Low Income Educational Opportunity Act of 1996, would establish an education choice scholarship program that includes both private and religious schools in "renewal communities."  Each locality would determine the value of the scholarship for poor children, but the maximum value of the scholarship would not exceed the per capita cost of educating children in a local public school. The scholarships available to poor children would have a minimum value not less than 66 percent of the per capita cost of educating children in the local public schools or the tuition normally charged by the private school. Parents would not be forbidden from using scholarships to pay for tuition in religious schools, and local authorities would not be able to discriminate against parents or children who do so. The scholarship program would be supported from existing federal funds.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where their children go to school is a serious question for parents. President and Mrs. Clinton are willing to pay an annual tuition of more than $11,000 to send their daughter Chelsea to the exclusive Sidwell Friends School. Vice President and Mrs. Gore chose St. Albans School, a few blocks from Sidwell, for their son, as did D.C.'s Shadow Senator Jesse Jackson. The Clintons, like the Gores and many other parents among the nation's social and political elite, have made a conscious decision that the Washington, D.C., public schools, recently the subject of failed congressional reform efforts, are not good enough for their children. They also have decided that a school with religious affiliation is important.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While most Americans intuitively understand what is best for their children, public policy has made it difficult for all but the well-to-do to choose the school they prefer. Indeed, implicit in public policy is the assumption that where a child goes to school is unimportant. But the evidence is in: Where a child goes to school matters a good deal -- better a good school than a bad school.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More important, the empirical evidence clearly reveals that most private schools do a better job than most public schools, particularly with poor and minority youngsters. Yet for more than a century, public policies in the United States have made it virtually impossible to provide public funds for children to attend private schools.<sup>3</sup>  In this regard, the United States stands virtually alone among the world's democracies.<sup>4</sup>  With enactment of the Watts-Talent bill, this dubious distinction would come to an end.
<p>
<b>THE CHANGING INTELLECTUAL CLIMATE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For many years -- in the 1960s and 1970s in particular -- a body of thought developed in this country which emphasized a child's "background" characteristics, which were assumed to be paramount. Success in school was the luck of the socioeconomic draw. It made little or no difference where children went to school, whether urban or rural, north or south, east or west, public or private; what was important was what they brought to school with them.<sup>5</sup>  If they were poor and dispossessed, they probably would do poorly. If they were poor and members of a minority group, they were almost certain to do poorly. By way of contrast, advantaged youngsters from enriched backgrounds did well. That was -- and is -- the argument. That it flies in the face of experience and common sense has done nothing to temper its enthusiastic reception among policymaking elites.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The modern incarnation of this general argument emerged from both the incomplete interpretation and the substantial misinterpretation of early work by James Coleman, a nationally prominent sociological researcher, then at Johns Hopkins.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In research conducted under the auspices of the U.S. Office of Education (predecessor to the U.S. Department of Education), Coleman and his colleagues initially found little in the way of school effects; factors like race, income, and parental level of education were stronger than school characteristics as predictors of school performance. What did seem to make a modest difference was who you went to school with; poor black youngsters appeared to do better in integrated settings. But as any competent policy analyst knows, absence of proof is not proof of absence. Because "school effects" were elusive or hard to find and measure did not mean they did not exist.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To the contrary, if "school effects" really were only weak (or worse yet, if they did not exist at all), the whole rationale of public education would come tumbling down. Indeed, so might that of private schooling. If nothing matters, there is no point in worrying about the right way to educate children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There was, however, a widespread desire to believe a variation of such an unlikely interpretation. Among liberals who believed in vigorous, interventionist government, the lack of "school effects" was interpreted to mean that these effects were not sufficiently robust. What was needed was "more" impact: more money for schools. If race and socioeconomic status (or SES in the jargon of sociologists) were more powerful determinants of school performance than schools themselves, the schools must be weak. Other larger, even more ambitious government programs would be in order.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Just as geography was destiny in the 19th century, SES became destiny in the 20th. The ironies in this development were many. In liberal hands, it became an argument designed to bolster the theory that the only good school is a rich school (and a rich public one at that). At the same time, it became an argument that absolves the existing school of its obligations to its students. It "blames the victim."  The school is not at fault if students do not learn. Schools have little or no effect; it all depends on the raw material.<sup>7</sup>  This sentiment is nicely encapsulated in a song ("Gee, Officer Krupke!") from Leonard Bernstein's classic <I>West Side Story</I>: "Hey, I'm depraved on accounta I'm deprived."
<p>
<b>WHY SCHOOLS MATTER</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such conventional liberal theory is bad pedagogy and worse public policy. Indeed, it fell to James Coleman, then a professor at the University of Chicago, to reopen the argument with extraordinarily powerful research that demonstrated the strong effect of Catholic schools, particularly on poor black children.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This research, widely reported in 1981 when it appeared in summary form in <I>The Public Interest</I>, is as valid today as it was then. Coleman also noted the embarrassing fact, still a stark feature of today's school choice debate, that "there are many who vigorously oppose making private school attendance easier and at the same time have their own children enrolled in private school."<sup>9</sup>  Coleman set out to answer three vital questions:
<p><ol>
<b><li></b> Do private schools provide better education?
<p>
<b><li></b> If they do, what is the public policy interest in denying poor children access to them?
<p>
<b><li></b> Is it true, as opponents of public funding allege, that private schools racially segregate children?
</ol> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Coleman's first hurdle was methodological: how to distinguish "the effects of selection from the effects of the school itself" to control, "even to the extent of overcompensating," for selection into the schools. This he did. His academic findings are hardly surprising: "higher learning in the Catholic schools than in the public school."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The literature in this area is not restricted to Coleman's seminal work, as John Convey's 218-page <I>Catholic Schools Make a Difference</I> reveals.<sup>10</sup>  Convey reports that in a series of studies based on National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data, Lee and Stewart "documented consistently higher scores of Catholic school students compared with public school students."  For example, the average Catholic school student in grades 4 and 8 scored significantly higher in reading and writing.<sup>11</sup>  In addition, Andrew Greeley's analysis of data from the High School and Beyond longitudinal study showed superior performance among whites, blacks, and Hispanics in Catholic school by every single category (Vocabulary, Reading, Math 1, Math 2, Science, and Writing), and Marks and Lee, writing in 1989, found higher scores in Catholic schools in grades 3, 7, and 11 among whites, blacks, and Hispanics in every single category for math, science, and reading.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most imposing studies, however, are those of Coleman and his colleagues. Catholic school sophomores, for example, scored 10 percent higher in science and 12 percent higher in civics, and from 17 percent to 21 percent higher in mathematics, writing, reading, and vocabulary. Catholic school seniors also consistently outscored public high school students: 10 percent to 17 percent higher in reading, mathematics, and vocabulary, and from 3 percent lower to 7 percent higher on three tests that measure ability more than achievement.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last finding strongly suggests that the explanation for higher scores lies not in some "ability" differential, but in what the schools do with what they have. Catholic schools expect much of their students, whatever their race and background, and expecting much, get much.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although Coleman found even higher scores in non-Catholic private schools, the more important sample is Catholic schools, which are the dominant force in the non-government school market. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Coleman also was concerned with other issues, most notably the impact of choice on racial integration. Here the findings were equally unambiguous: A child is more likely to attend school with a child of another race in the private sector than in the public sector. The importance of this early finding would be hard to overstate; "suburban schools within the public sector are used as a haven to a much greater extent than in the private sector."  Counterbalancing "bright" flight to the suburbs is the behavior of students in Catholic school. Coleman's figures on dropouts are striking. Among white students in public school, 13.1 percent dropped out compared with 2.6 percent in Catholic schools; among Hispanic students, the difference was two to one (19.1 percent to 9.3 percent); and among black students, the difference was more than 3.5 to one (17.2 percent to 4.6 percent).<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Coleman's first finding concerning school effects should have been received with rejoicing by the professional educators who had endured their share of bad press. Their magazines and journals should have featured articles on why schools make a difference. So also should the nation's civil rights leadership have reacted positively to Coleman's finding about racial integration in the private sector. Indeed, the refusal of the U.S. Supreme Court to establish "metropolitan" remedies for past cases of racial discrimination makes the Coleman finding all the more important, because private school attendance is almost never geographically based. Private schools, already better integrated than public schools, offer more fertile fields for expanded racial integration over time than do the public schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such reactions, however, were rare, and the reason is not hard to fathom. Had Professor Coleman's rigorous social science work revealed stronger public than private school effects, there would have been joy in the great halls of the education establishment.<sup>15</sup>  But because one of the bastions of "good schooling" is the private sector,<sup>16</sup> public school educators could not -- would not -- accept his findings. Coleman, on the other hand, did no such disservice to the authorities who run the public schools. He followed the evidence where it led and found that all schools that exhibit similar characteristics have strong school effects. All schools, whether public or private, that exhibit the same cluster of attributes -- high expectations, a focused curriculum, good order and discipline, caring teachers, enterprising students -- have relatively robust "school effects."  What is important is that these characteristics are found more readily and more often in private schools.
<p>
<b>THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL CAPITAL</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to his school effects work, Professor Coleman returned to the questions that had intrigued him originally: Even if some schools are better than others, what difference does what the student brings to school make?<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What are the cultural and social traits that make a difference?  The potential for synergy is obvious, as are the public policy implications.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Social capital" is the cluster of skills, attitudes, and (to a lesser extent) knowledge that the student acquires in the non-school environment. Clearly, a child who is disruptive and unruly and who has only weakly developed academic interests is less likely to do well in any school, "good" or "bad," while youngsters who bring with them a love of learning, disciplined and orderly habits, and respect for themselves and other students, as well as for the teacher, are much more likely to do well, all other things being equal. These traits -- what might be called pro-academic traits -- are the product of caring and supportive communities, voluntarily created and maintained. Though they may include people who look alike, in the final analysis they are not defined by race, socioeconomic status, or ethnicity; they bridge all those gaps. They are associative communities made up of superficially similar or different people who share common values and virtues. In a school setting, to use a quaint term, they are "communities of scholarship."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Members of Congress and state and local legislators alike should recognize the public policy implications of "social capital."  The most important single thing they can do in this regard is to encourage its formation and continuance by underwriting education choice. Not only does choice permit the expression of "social capital;" it builds and reinforces the habits of mind that are essential to voluntary association -- the same habits of mind that are essential to civil society. In a school setting, choice imposes the burden of choosing; there is no escape. One must make one's bed and lie in it; no one else does it for you. School choice proposals, including the school choice component of the Watts-Talent legislation, foster democratic habits of mind that are essential to a free society.
<p>

<b>THE HIGH STAKES IN SCHOOLS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reasons for the high quality of private schools are several and have to do largely with organization, incentives, and rewards. Most simply, voluntary association makes a difference. In the public sector, the organizational climate conspires against dedicated teachers and hard-working students; in the private sector, it encourages and rewards high levels of performance. In short, monopolies are no better in the public sector than in the private sector. They serve only the interests of the "owners," never the interests of workers or clients.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the public sector, of course, the "owners" do not literally own the schools. Rather, they are managers and bureaucrats, and the schools are run for them, not for teachers and students. This rather unappealing picture is not restricted to the public sector; managerial capitalism also looks a good deal like this, which is why it is under fire from liberal and conservative critics alike. The Watts-Talent legislation would permit parents of poor children to "own" their own schools instead of having to submit to the bureaucracy that runs government schools.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
America's policymakers seem willing to tolerate failures and weaknesses in education that they would not tolerate in any other area of public policy. Coleman's findings are so powerful that were he dealing with any other area of public policy -- health, welfare, housing, transportation, or juvenile justice -- shifts in public policy would begin to reflect the new knowledge he contributed. But public schooling is a nearly immovable object; public schools are run for the convenience of, and at the pleasure of, their managers, not for the benefit of students and their families.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	When they debate the issue of school choice, Members of Congress should consider the "school effects" literature in terms of academic outcomes; its conclusions are wholly unsurprising. In light of their "environment," one would expect private schools to "do better."  They must if they are to survive. All parents who enroll their children in private school go through at least a two-step process.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>First</b>, they must decide to enroll their children in a non-government school and find the financial wherewithal to deliver on this decision. Almost without exception, this involves the payment of substantial tuition and fees out of pocket. Indeed, because people value what they pay for, "full-ride" scholarships are almost unknown in private elementary and secondary education. Even -- perhaps particularly -- schools like Father Clemens's Our Lady of Angels in Chicago charge at least a modest tuition.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Second</b>, the financial commitment families make to send their children to private school is a proxy for a personal commitment to education, the importance of which is hard to overestimate. It makes schools and their families partners in a way that the a public sector monopoly can never hope to achieve.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Probably the most important "school effects" issue is not the measured academic "outcomes" of schooling, but the school's impact in the market. In a market, a school must "sell" and parents must "buy."  That is the market<I>par excellence</I>. Goods and services that do not sell have no effect; indeed, they do not stay in the market. Only monopolists -- particularly government monopolists -- stay in markets when no rational consumer wants their product or service. Poor children, for all practical purposes, today have no options.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This issue came to a head this year when Congress considered school choice as part of the Washington, D.C., FY 1996 appropriations bill. Representative Steve Gunderson (R-WI) offered an amendment that would have given scholarships of up to $3,000 for students whose family incomes were at or below the poverty level and up to $1,500 for students whose family incomes were not more than 185 percent above the poverty level. The Senate, however, when presented with this opportunity to expand choice for children in Washington's failing public school system, refused to do so. Only four members of the Senate had sent their children to D.C.'s public schools.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The obvious assumption, of course, is that D.C.'s public school system is tolerable for poor children but not a serious option for members of the United States Senate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On the wisdom of these official restrictions, let the late Professor James Coleman answer the critics. His is an eloquent summation of the case for justice and dignity:
<p><blockquote>
	There may be a rationale for some protective barriers to encourage participation in the public schools, but certainly not those that exist now, which harm most the interests of those least well-off and protect most those public schools that are the worst. In short, the tuition barrier to private schooling as it exists now is almost certainly harmful to the public interest, and especially harmful to the interests of those least well-off.<sup>20</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As Members of Congress consider the Watts-Talent school choice provisions, they have another chance to do the right thing.

<li>    The most important work in this field is that of the late sociologist James Coleman. A researcher of towering intellect and erudition who also was devoid of ideological predisposition, Coleman followed the data wherever they led, often at the cost of personal peace of mind. He was vilified by the American Sociological Association for taking the politically incorrect position that public support of private schooling was a defensible public policy option (although, to its credit, the ASA retracted its condemnation to award him a medal shortly before his death). Coleman never wavered in his quiet and determined defense of the truth as he understood it. While his prose style and the heavy quantitative emphasis of his major works are a bit daunting for the generalist, his articles are clear, concise, and lively. A perfect example -- as current today as when it was published -- is "Public Schools, Private Schools, and the Public Interest," <I>The Public Interest</I>, No. 64 (Summer 1981). Father Andrew M. Greeley's work is on point as well. In particular, see <I>Catholic High Schools and Minority Students</I> (New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Books, 1982).<p>
<li>    In particular, see "Foreword," in Thomas Vitullo-Martin and Bruce S. Cooper, <I>Separation of Church and Child: The Constitution and Federal Aid to Religious Schools</I> (Indianapolis, Ind.: Hudson Institute, 1987).<p>
<li>       See Charles L. Glenn, <I>Choice of Schools in Six Nations</I> (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Education, 1989), and <I>Educational Freedom in Eastern Europe</I> (Washington, D.C.: Cato Institute, 1995). Glenn, one of the nation's leading authorities on public funding for attendance at private schools, for 21 years was the Massachusetts State Department of Education official responsible for civil rights and urban education opportunity. Recognizing the failure of busing, Glenn pioneered education choice programs.<p>
<li>   One long-standing trend, the concentration of high test scores in the Northern tier of states from Maine to Montana, led Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY) to propose facetiously the following policy remedy to states concerned about low test scores: Move your state north.<p>
<li>    Coleman's first major study which permitted a systematic examination of this and related questions was prepared under the terms of a major grant from the U.S. Office of Education, part of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now the Department of Health and Human Services). Titled <I>Equality of Educational Opportunity</I>, it was released in 1966 and caused an immediate sensation. Coleman and his colleagues could find no school effects of consequence; indeed, any school effect seemed to be overwhelmed by student background characteristics. Policymakers were led in two different directions by this surprising "non-finding."  Many analysts concluded that school effects were minimal (at least from a public policy standpoint; they still put their own children in "good" schools). Needless to say, their public policy conclusion was a counsel of despair; after all, the whole American experiment in self-governance was based on the Founders' conviction that an educated citizenry is essential to democracy. The other direction, equally misleading, fueled the notion that black children could learn only if they were integrated with white children. While racial integration is a laudable objective, it is patronizing in the extreme to argue that black children must be integrated to learn. More to the point is the quality of facilities, books, teacher preparation, and the like.<p>

<li>    Although most Americans are convinced that private schools are simply better than public schools, this is not an altogether implausible proposition. It was true in Australia, leading the Australian Labour Party (similar to the Democratic Party in the United States) to support public aid to private schools. Sparked by the work of Father James Carroll, who later became Bishop of Sydney, public funding was made available on the basis of the following argument: Catholic schools are inferior (by almost any academic or fiscal measure) and will remain so unless public funding is provided; Catholics (and non-Catholics who attend these schools) will not abandon their schools; and no good public end is served by denying poor Australian children a quality education in the schools in which they chose to enroll.

<li>  
 Not to put too fine a point on it, but private schools are a red flag to the public school bull. The intensity of the hostility most public school leaders feel for private schools is understood more easily in psychological terms than in logical terms. Private schools, for example, are accused of being "elitist," a sin as serious as racism or sexism in the modern pantheon of bad attitudes. But the facts, as Coleman and others have revealed, are otherwise. For a longer disquisition on this general subject, see "A Din of Inequity?

<li>   An example of more than passing importance, Father Clemens's school operates on an extended day and year, is in the middle of the ghetto, has a waiting list, accepts only children from families on welfare, and still charges tuition. His reasoning?  If they can afford a phone, a TV, sneakers, and Bulls jackets, they can scrape together some tuition. Moreover, all families are expected to give time to school projects -- not just the PTA, but painting and fix-up activities as well. Finally, families that really cannot afford any tuition are allowed to "work off" the obligation: Families that pay something are families that take school seriously.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Congress soon will have an opportunity to promote the moral renewal and economic revitalization of America's most poverty-stricken urban and rural areas. The measure to accomplish this task is Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3467:">H.R. 3467</a>), sponsored by Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and <a href="http://www.house.gov/talent/welcome.html">James Talent</a> (R-MO). The bill would assist families in areas with high rates of poverty, crime, welfare dependency, joblessness, and poor schools. Through serious tax incentives and regulatory relief, coupled with innovative school reform pilot projects and home ownership incentives, the bill would achieve:<ul>

<p><li>Increased job creation;

<p><li>Small business expansion and formation;

<p.<li>Moral renewal;

<p><li>Expanded educational opportunities;

<p><li>Greater private philanthropy to aid the poor; and

<p><li>Greater participation by religious organizations in providing services to the poor.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Far too many of America's urban and rural neighborhoods are characterized by large numbers of people in poverty, as well as by juvenile crime, illegitimacy, joblessness, and female-headed households. Because companies are not investing in these areas, local economic growth and opportunity are hampered. And quick-fix short-term solutions, such as raising the minimum wage, do little to help improve the lives of people entangled in a web of poverty, crime, and illegitimacy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The problems of these communities are related to weaknesses of the local economy and the weakening of the moral and social fabric of the community itself; for policymakers to view the decline of these communities as the result of only one or the other prevents them from bringing about real and sustainable reform. Congress needs to strip away regulatory and institutional barriers that thwart rebuilding the broken lives and economies of these areas. The adoption of a wholly new and comprehensive urban policy of the sort that is embodied in the Saving Our Children bill would help the citizens of these communities achieve a better life for themselves and their children, not just by creating a far more favorable climate for business activity, but also by empowering the citizens of these communities to become active decision makers in their own lives and the lives of their children rather than merely passive subjects of the decisions of inflexible government social service and education bureaucracies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Recent studies have shown that a comprehensive approach to community development is the best way to bring substantive change to distressed and impoverished communities. It also appears that the social programs that work best are community-based. Such local initiatives are the most effective means of attacking the often difficult problems that individuals and families have with joblessness, poor education, crime, drugs, and welfare dependency. For example, a 1989 study reported that 81 percent of families in poverty face multiple obstacles to achieving self-sufficiency.<sup>1</sup>  For many years, government agencies have tended to focus on single issues, such as housing or health. But policymakers increasingly are realizing that a piece-by-piece approach to urban policy is not likely to succeed. As Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros puts it, "We believe the best strategy to community development is a community-driven, comprehensive approach which coordinates economic, physical, environmental, community and human needs."<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Saving Our Children bill gives Congress and the Administration an opportunity to act on this commitment and change the way the federal government has been involved in community development over the last 30 years. By lessening federal regulations and taxes, and increasing parents' freedom to choose schools that reflect their ideals, the communities that need the most assistance can serve as local laboratories of reform, generating ideas and inspiration for various other communities across the nation, as well as for policymakers in Washington.
<p>
<b>WHAT THE SAVING OUR CHILDREN BILL DOES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Saving Our Children bill has five main elements. The first two apply to the 100 "renewal communities" created by the bill. The remaining three major reforms apply nationwide.
<p>
<b>1. Creation of Renewal Communities.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Title I creates up to 100 renewal communities across the nation, based on the degree to which an area is characterized by poverty and distress. Through tax relief, regulatory reform, and savings incentives for Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) recipients, this title would aid the poorest communities in the nation. Specifically, it would:<ul>

<p><li><b>Provide</b> federal, state, and local tax and regulatory relief through provisions such as 100 percent capital gains tax exclusion on qualified assets held within a renewal community for at least five years.

<p><li><b>Enhance and increase</b> community involvement and ownership, in part through the creation of Family Development Accounts. These accounts would encourage EITC recipients to save money tax-free for certain expenditures such as higher education or buying a home for the first time.

<p><li><b>Improve</b> the delivery of local government services by encouraging privatization and increases in efficiency.

<p><li><b>Encourage</b> financial institutions to maintain a presence and invest in designated renewal communities.
</ul>
<p>
<b>2. Education Scholarships for Poor Children within Renewal Communities.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

As a condition of becoming a renewal community, a locality would administer the federally funded Low-Income Educational Opportunity Scholarship Program established under Title IV of the bill. Low-income parents within the renewal community would be given federally funded scholarships to send their children to primary and secondary schools chosen by the parent. Poor parents would be able to use these scholarships to choose to send their children to a variety of schools, including alternative public schools, private schools, and private religious schools. Because religious schools can play a critical role in rebuilding the moral foundation of America's inner cities, they are included as an essential component of the scholarship program.

<p>
<b>3. Charitable Contribution Tax Credit.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

To encourage charitable contributions to private organizations aiding the poor, the bill would create a tax credit that refunds 75 percent of a taxpayer's contribution to any private charity engaged primarily in providing direct services to the poor. The maximum eligible contribution would be $200 for single filers and $400 for joint filers. The credit would be available to all federal income tax filers nationwide, regardless of whether they itemize deductions on their tax returns.
<p>

<b>4. Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Until now, religiously affiliated drug treatment centers have been hampered in their ability to receive funds under the Public Health Service Act. Title III of the bill would amend current law to allow such organizations to receive federal funds for the treatment services they provide without restricting their religious activity. In addition, this section recognizes that religious education and religiously motivated drug treatment personnel can have a vital and important role in effective drug treatment. Thus, it would loosen unnecessary bureaucratic credentialing requirements on treatment staff which may bar religious drug treatment programs from receiving federal drug rehabilitation funds. These provisions would apply nationwide.

<p>
<b>5. Work Opportunity Tax Credit.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
With teenage unemployment at nearly 20 percent, this provision gives employers tax incentives to hire individuals who are welfare recipients or "high-risk" youth, the persons who have a more difficult time securing permanent employment. This tax provision also would apply nationwide.
<p>

<b>CREATING RENEWAL COMMUNITIES</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under Title 1, state or local governments would apply to the U.S. Department of Housing and Development (HUD) to have certain depressed areas designated as "renewal communities."  Up to 100 such communities would be created nationwide. To qualify under the terms of the bill, the local area must be low income, and local authorities must agree both to ease regulations that impede economic activity and to operate the scholarship program for poor children provided in Title IV. If more than 100 localities applied to become renewal communities, HUD would select the 100 poorest. Upon becoming a renewal community, a locality would receive substantial tax and regulatory relief. Designated renewal communities would retain their status for seven years.
<p>

<b>1) Eligible Areas.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To become one of the 100 renewal communities, a local area would have to be nominated by a state or local government officials and would have to meet the following criteria:
<ul>
<p><li>The locality must be an economically depressed area within a larger city or county.

<p><li>The locality must be characterized by pervasive poverty and distress and entirely located within the jurisdiction of a local government eligible to receive Community Development Block Grant funds (according to Section 119 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974). This means that a renewal community must be a subsection within the jurisdiction of a local government that is itself characterized by poverty and distress, not simply a pocket of poverty within an area of general affluence.

<p><li>The unemployment rate within the locality must be 1 1/2 times the national unemployment rate.

<p><li>Each census tract within the locality must have a poverty rate of at least 20 percent.

<p><li>At least 70 percent of the households within the locality must have incomes below 80 percent of the median income of households within the jurisdiction of local government.

<p><li>The locality must have a continuous boundary and be located within the jurisdiction of one local government.

<p><li>If any part of an area is located within a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) with a population greater than 50,000, the minimum population within the renewal community area must be at least 4,000. For all other non-rural and non-MSA areas, the population within the proposed community must be at least 1,000 or located entirely within an Indian Reservation.

<p><li>Ten percent of the renewal communities must be in rural areas. For an area to be considered "rural," it must be within a local government jurisdiction with less than 50,000 people, be outside a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) as defined by the Census bureau, or otherwise be considered rural by the Secretary of HUD.
</ul>
<p>
<b>2) Required Commitments by Local Officials.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For an area to become a renewal community, state and local government officials and representatives of neighborhood organizations must express in writing their commitment to reduce taxes, regulations, and burdens on businesses within the renewal community area in at least five of the following seven ways:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Reduce</b> taxes and fees;

<p><li><b>Increase</b> the level of efficiency of local services;

<p><li><b>Develop and implement</b> crime reduction strategies;

<p><li><b>Streamline</b> government requirements and regulations;

<p><li><b>Foster</b> coordination between and involvement of private organizations and community groups, and encourage such groups to provide jobs and job training, technical, financial, or other assistance to employers, employees, and other residents from the renewal community;<sup>3</sup>

<p><li><b>Provide</b> state or local income tax benefits for fees paid for services, such as trash collection, that formerly were performed by the government but now are privatized; and

<p><li><b>Encourage</b> the donation or sale of land, homes, and commercial/industrial structures to neighborhood organizations, community development corporations, or private companies.
</ul><p>

<b>3) Required Economic Growth Measures.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To establish a renewal community, state and local officials must repeal or suspend government regulations, except for those required to protect health and safety. These include:
<ul>
<p><li><b>License requirements</b> for occupations that do not require a professional degree;

<P><li><b>Zoning restrictions</b> on home-based businesses that are not a public nuisance;

<p><li><b>Permit requirements</b> for street vendors that are not a public nuisance;

<p><li><b>Zoning and other restrictions</b> that impede the formation of schools and child care centers; and

<p><li><b>Restrictions on competition</b> for businesses providing public services, such as cable TV, taxicabs, or trash removal.
</ul>
<p>
<b>4) Tax Breaks to Stimulate Jobs in Poor Neighborhoods.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Enterprise Zones, if crafted correctly, hold great promise in restoring economic vitality to poor neighborhoods.<sup>4</sup>  Experience with "enterprise zones" has shown that targeted tax relief on business activity in depressed inner city areas over time can cut the unemployment rate in those areas by a third or more.<sup>5</sup>  To create jobs and stimulate business activity in local communities, the Watts-Talent bill will match tax cutting and deregulation at the local level with a sharp reduction in federal taxes within the locality.
<p>
<b>Exclusion from Capital Gains.</b> Once a local area has been designated a renewal community, the bill would reduce federal taxes on private investment in any qualified renewal community enterprise (defined as a business that derives at least 80 percent of its gross income from within the community and has at least 35 percent of its employees living in the renewal community). The tax benefits for investment in qualified businesses within the renewal community area include a 100 percent exclusion of capital gains tax. An individual would not be taxed for any capital gains resulting from the sale of assets of a qualified renewal community enterprise held for more than five years. This exclusion is limited to $100,000 per tax year and a $500,000 total.
<p>
<b>Deduction of Stock Purchases.</b> Individuals in these communities would have the option to deduct certain purchases of stock of qualified renewal community enterprises instead of taking the 100 percent exclusion from capital gains.
<p>
<b>Deduction for Tangible Property.</b> Individuals and businesses in these communities also would have reduced up-front taxation on investments in tangible property within the renewal community. Under current federal income tax law, businesses and individuals may deduct up $17,500 from their federal income tax to cover current year capital investment costs.<sup>6</sup>  Under the Watts-Talent bill, an extra $35,000 could be deducted for investment in renewal community businesses.<sup>7</sup>
i<p>
<b>Tax Credit for Revitalization.</b> To encourage the renovation of decaying buildings that often blight impoverished areas, Section 107 of the bill gives taxpayers a tax credit equal to a percentage of their qualified revitalization expenditures within the renewal community. A person either could receive up front a tax credit of 20 percent of revitalization expenditures for the tax year a revitalized building is completed or could elect to receive a credit of 5 percent each year for ten years, beginning with the year the building is completed. The maximum expenditure for which a taxpayer may receive credit is $10 million. The building may not be a residence and must be located within the renewal community, and the revitalization costs must exceed 25 percent of the fair market value of the structure.
<p>
<b>Establishing Family Development Accounts for Renewal Community EITC Recipients.</b> Section 106 of the bill also authorizes the creation of Family Development Accounts (FDAs) designed to encourage low-income families to save a portion of their income or their Earned Income Tax Credit refund. Cash donations would be deductible, even if the individual does not itemize. Withdrawals from these accounts would be tax-free if the money is used for certain specified expenditures. Contributions to FDAs would be limited to the lesser of $2,000 or the total amount of a person's compensation included in gross income for a given tax year. Persons donating to the family accounts of others would be limited to a deduction of $1,000.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Family Development Account funds can be used tax-free for the following expenses:
<ul>
<p><li>Post-secondary education tuition and expenses;

<p><li>First-home purchasing costs;

<p><li>Business capitalization expenditures, including capital, plant, equipment, working capital, and inventory expenses, with such businesses required to have an approved business plan;

<p><li>Medical expenses not otherwise covered by insurance; and

<p><li>Qualified rollovers which involve paying into another individual's FDA with funds from one's own account.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If an employer paid into a worker's FDA, the employer's contribution also would be counted as compensation. Matches also could be provided by state or local governments, service organizations, corporations, local churches, foundations, or other such organizations.
<p>

<b>5. FDA Matching Fund Program Demonstration Areas. </b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under the bill, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development could select up to 25 communities, with a minimum of two rural areas and based on their relative impoverishment, to serve as demonstration areas for an FDA matching fund program. Within these areas, each qualified individual would have an amount, equal to the amount deposited into the FDA account by the individual, matched by the federal government. This matching amount would be limited to $1,000 each year. The maximum one person could ever receive from the federal government is $2,000.

<p>
<b>6. Community Reinvestment Act.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  
To encourage financial institutions to maintain a presence and invest in designated renewal communities, Section 501 of Title V directs that such efforts be taken into account when assessing an institution's compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (12 USC 2903).
<p>
<b>7. FDA Application Fees.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  
Section 502 waives "application fees" required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve a drug developed within a renewal community.

<p>
<b>LOW-INCOME EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In order to become a renewal community, local officials also must agree to operate the bill's Low-Income Educational Opportunity Scholarship Program for poor children within the community. The program provides federally funded scholarships to enable poor parents to send their children to a broader range of primary and secondary schools. It has two goals:
<ul>
<p><li>GOAL #1: To expand educational opportunity for poor children by giving their parents a broader range of choice in determining where the child goes to school; and
<p><li>GOAL #2: To foster moral renewal in a community by enabling poor parents to send their children to religious schools which teach moral principles and instill virtue as an essential ingredient of education.
</ul><p>
<b>Parental Right of Choice.</b> Parents would be eligible to receive funds under the scholarship program for their children if (a) they live in the designated renewal community; (b) the family income does not exceed 185 percent of the poverty line; and (c) they have elected to participate in the program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Parents of children who received financial assistance under this program would be free to choose from a wide range of types of schools, including alternative public schools, charter schools, private schools, and private religious schools.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A parent would be able to redeem a scholarship at any private or private religious school within the locality which meets the health and educational standards for private schools within the locality which existed as of January 1, 1996.<sup>8</sup>  All schools which redeemed these special scholarships would be required to comply with the anti-discrimination provisions of Section 601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and not to discriminate on the basis of race.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill would require renewal communities to give parents timely information to enable them to make informed decisions about the education of their children. At the very least, the information would have to explain the scholarship fund, describe the eligibility requirements and selection procedure, and provide information about alternative public schools and scholarship schools.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A locality would have to allocate scholarships and transportation aid to eligible parents who apply for aid on a first-come, first-served basis or through another mechanism of selection determined by the locality which does not discriminate on the basis of the type of school selected by the parent. The scholarships are not entitlements.

<p>
<b>Types and Value of Scholarships for Poor Children</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Far too many poor children are trapped in poorly performing schools. Funds under the program are intended to broaden the educational choices of poor parents and children within the renewal community. If the parents chose to send their child to an alternative public school where tuition is already paid, under the bill they would receive funds to cover the costs of transportation. If they elected to send their child to a private school, they would receive a scholarship for the child which could be used only to pay for tuition and educational fees at the selected school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Each locality would determine the precise monetary value of scholarships for children in their locality. The bill establishes the range of local options, but the maximum value of the scholarship also must not exceed the per capita cost of educating children in a public school in the locality. Further, the scholarship must have minimum value, which shall not fall below the lesser of a) 60 percent of the average cost of educating children in the public schools in the locality during the preceding year or b) the normal tuition charged by the private school.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Each renewal community would be given a fixed amount each year to pay for scholarships and transportation aid for poor children. If the number of low-income parents who applied for scholarships and or transportation aid was insufficient to utilize all the funds available, any surplus funds could be used to assist in educating low-income children within the community's public schools.
<p>

<b>Poor Parents, Poor Children, and Religious Schools</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Americans are increasingly concerned about the character and quality of the social order, the apparent decline in the culture, and the corrosive influences of that culture on family life and the moral condition of the country. These concerns are common to Americans, regardless of their racial or income group or where they live and work. For a variety of reasons, individuals and families, children especially, are even more vulnerable to social pathologies, including violent crime, illegal drug use, and illegitimacy and family breakdown.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<b>Importance of Religion.</b> A central goal of the  Saving Our Children bill is to foster moral renewal in inner-city communities wracked by crime, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity, and family disintegration. The sponsors of the bill recognize that building a sound moral foundation is the most important aspect of a child's education and that moral renewal is critical to solving urban social problems. The power of religion to help the poor help themselves is amply documented.<sup>11</sUP>  Investigating the condition of black inner-city youth, Richard Freeman of Harvard University finds that boys who regularly attend church are 50 percent less likely to engage in crime than boys of similar backgrounds who do not attend church; they also are 54 percent less likely to use drugs and 47 percent less likely to drop out of school.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Boys and girls who attend church regularly are two-thirds less likely to engage in sexual activity in their teens. Regular church attendance halves the probability that a woman will have a child out of wedlock.<sup>13</sUP>  Children attending religious schools are two-thirds less likely to drop out than are nearly identical children who attend secular schools.<sup>14</sup>  Children ages 10 to 18 who do not attend church are a third to a half more likely to exhibit anti-social and dysfunctional behavior.<sup>15</sUP>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Social consequences follow from school choice.<sup>16</sup>  The bill therefore helps poor parents give their children a sound moral upbringing by allowing them to use scholarships to send children to religious schools.
<p>
<b>Constitutional Issues.</b> The Supreme Court has held that as long as the parent, not the government, decides where the scholarship will be spent on a child's behalf, public funds can be used for education in a religious institution because the government has neither advanced nor inhibited a particular religion and therefore has not violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment.<sup>17</sup>  For example, in the 1986 case of <I>Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind,</I> Larry Witters, a blind man, wished to use state vocational funds to attend religious seminary to help him fulfill his personal goal of becoming a minister. The U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that Witters's use of state vocational funds to attend seminary did not violate the U.S. Constitution. Writing for the majority, Justice Thurgood Marshall asserted:
<blockquote>
	It is well settled that the Establishment Clause is not violated every time money previously in the possession of a state is conveyed to a religious institution. For example, a State may issue a paycheck to one of its employees, who may then donate all or part of that paycheck to a religious institution, all without constitutional barriers.<sup>18</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Justice Marshall further argued that it was permissible for Witters to use government vocational funds to attend seminary because the individual, not the government itself, was determining how to allocate the money:
<blockquote>
	Any aid provided under Washington's program that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients. The decision to support religious education is made by the individual, not the state.<sup>19</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under the bill, local officials may not prohibit poor parents from using the Watts-Talent scholarships to pay for tuition in religious schools and may not discriminate in any way against parents who choose to place their child in a religious school. If provisions of a state constitution prohibit state and local funds from being spent at religious institutions,<sup>20</sup> the renewal community can segregate all federal funds from state funds. But state and local officials may not prevent poor parents from using federal scholarship funds designated for poor children to pay for tuition in religious schools.
<p>

<b>Eligible Schools and Civil Rights Safeguards</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To receive scholarships, a school must comply with relevant anti-discrimination provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and also must satisfy applicable state and local requirements for curriculum and facilities and meet health and safety standards which existed as of January 1996. Schools are ineligible, however, if they advocate criminal behavior or are operated by an organization advocating criminal behavior.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The sponsors of the bill are careful to ensure that the scholarships will not become a Trojan horse leading to a government takeover of private or religious schools. The bill includes specific safeguards both to protect private schools which redeem scholarships from government intrusiveness and to protect the liberty of religious schools:
<ul>
<p><li>No additional regulations on burdensome paperwork may be imposed on private schools which redeem scholarships;

<p><li>Private schools redeeming scholarships will not be subject to regulations restricting religious instruction and shall be protected by the rights granted in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993;

<p><li>Any religious school may require its employees to adhere to its religious tenets and moral code of behavior;<sup>21</sup> and

<p><li>Private schools will be permitted to operate as single-sex institutions, or to operate classes separated by gender (Section 409[b][6]).
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill's language also includes a critical clarification to protect personal and religious liberty: No provision may be construed to give the federal government authority to direct or control the curriculum, administration, or personnel of any private school participating in the scholarship program (Section 410[c]).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill would require evaluation of the effects of the scholarship program. It authorizes studies comparing the performance of children with similar backgrounds to determine whether those from renewal communities who participate in the scholarship program outperform those who do not. In addition, the authorized studies would examine parental involvement and the degree to which it is improved when parents are able to choose where they send their children to school.

<p>
<b>Targeting Education Funds to Poor Communities</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Federal scholarship funds would be channeled to renewal communities through two funding tiers, with 80 percent of the funds allocated through the first tier. Under the first tier, the share of federal funds received by a renewal community shall be pro-rated based on the number of school-age children with family incomes below 185 percent of poverty residing in the community, relative to the total number of such low-income children residing in all renewal communities nationwide.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Twenty percent of scholarship funds must be allocated through the second tier. To encourage private-sector and state and local government contributions to the scholarship program, second tier funds are to be divided according to the level of non-federal financial support given to the program within each locality. The share of these funds given to a specific renewal community would be equal to that community's pro-rated share of non-federal contributions to the scholarship program within all renewal communities nationwide.
<p>

<b>REINFORCING AMERICA'S INDEPENDENT SECTOR</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To an increasing degree, Americans realize that government solutions to poverty enacted during the latter part of this century have failed. Since the beginning of the War on Poverty in 1965, the U.S. has spent $5.4 trillion to aid low-income Americans.<sup>22</sUp>  But in many ways, poor communities are worse off now than when Congress started to establish this vast array of federal social programs over 30 years ago. The following provisions would apply nationwide.
<p>
<b>A Charitable Tax Credit</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Saving Our Children bill creates a new tax credit, intended to encourage Americans to allocate more of their charitable contributions to private organizations that are fighting poverty effectively with low administrative overhead. According to Section 201 of Title II, taxpayers who donate to a qualified charity would receive a 75 percent tax credit for donations up to $200 for single and $400 for joint filers. This credit would be available regardless of whether a taxpayer itemizes deductions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A charity is qualified to receive donations under this provision if its predominant activity is the provision of direct services to individuals whose annual incomes generally do not exceed 185 percent of the official poverty line. A qualified charity must provide direct services to low income persons and may not participate in political activities such as lobbying, litigation on behalf of service recipients, public policy advocacy, public policy research, or voter registration.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill's underlying philosophical premise is that individual taxpayers, because they are closer to the needs of their communities, are better able to make decisions about where funds should go than are bureaucrats in Washington. They can target funds to programs that work. Giving taxpayers additional means with which to make financial contributions to worthy poverty-fighting organizations would enable them to become more involved in their communities, fostering a greater sense of civic duty and fellowship.
<p>
<b>Using Faith-Based Drug Treatment Centers</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 301 of Title III (Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse: Services Provided through Religious Organizations) applies nationwide. It amends the Public Health Service Act to meet three goals:<ul>

<p><li><b>To permit</b> faith-based substance abuse treatment centers to receive federal assistance and to prohibit discrimination against such centers;

<p><li><b>To make</b> it easier for individuals receiving federally funded drug treatment to select drug treatment therapy that is religious in nature; and

<p><li><b>To protect</b> the rights of individuals receiving drug treatment by ensuring that no individual can be required to receive services from a religious organization and guaranteeing that individuals who do not wish to receive drug treatment services from religious entities must be provided with alternative secular services.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Faith-based drug treatment is different from secular treatment in that it encourages a person to look beyond himself for the strength to overcome addiction. That apparently is why faith-based treatment is more effective than secular treatment: Individuals in any religious denomination or group have lower levels of drug use regardless of whether the denomination teaches against the use of alcohol, although denominations that teach against any use of drugs or alcohol exhibit the highest rates of drug avoidance.<sup>23</sup>  Likewise, religion has been shown to be a powerful force in helping alcoholics abstain from alcohol. For over half a century, Alcoholics Anonymous has encouraged participants to invoke a higher power to help them recover from their addiction.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reviewing the religious treatment of addicts, research psychiatrists at the Duke University Department of Psychiatry concluded in 1992 that the "role of religious commitment and religiously oriented treatment programs can be significant factors which ought to be considered and included when planning a mix of appropriate treatment alternatives.... Perhaps the greatest advantage of religious programs is their recourse to churches as a support system.... Religious treatment programs are not suitable for everyone. For those men and women who can accept the creeds, rituals, and commitments required of such programs there seem to be certain advantages."<sup>25</sup>
<p>
<b>Eliminating Discrimination.</b> Under Title III of the bill, religious organizations are eligible to receive program funds and provide drug treatment services on the same basis as any other nonprofit private organization. While religious organizations would be required to meet the general requirements for effective drug treatment, neither the federal government nor any state government receiving federal treatment funds shall discriminate against an organization because of its religious character. Neither the federal nor any state government could interfere with the definition, practice, or expression of an organization's religious beliefs; nor could they require the organization to alter its form of internal governance or remove religious art, icons, sacred scripture, or other such symbols. Religious organizations which receive funds under the bill also could require any or all employees to adhere to their organizational religious and moral tenets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the same time, the language of the bill would protect the religious liberty of drug users receiving treatment. Any person who objects to participating in a drug treatment program operated by a religious organization shall be given the option of receiving treatment in an alternative program operated by a secular organization.
<p>
<b>Personal Help.</b> States may provide beneficiaries with vouchers that enable them to choose among a wide variety of drug treatment programs under Title III. If a person needing drug treatment is given a voucher or other mode of reimbursement which enables that person to select the treatment program in which he will participate, the drug treatment monies may be used for any religious worship and instruction which is part of the overall drug treatment. This provision is fully in accord with U.S. Supreme Court rulings on the religious establishment clause in <I>Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District , Mueller v. Allen, and Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind.</I>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If a person with a drug abuse problem freely elects to participate in a religious drug treatment program rather than secular alternatives, the individual could be required to follow the rules set forth in the program and to participate in any religious practice or instruction that is part of the treatment program. Any individual who does not wish to participate in a drug treatment program operated by a religious organization is given the full right to refuse such treatment. Such individuals must be given the option of attending an equivalent alternative secular treatment program.
<p>
<b>Broadening Help for the Addicted.</b> The bill's language also stipulates that state or local governments should recognize that religious education can have a critical role in providing effective drug treatment. In applying education qualifications as a condition for receiving federal funds, state or local governments would have to give credit for religious education that is equivalent to the credit given for secular course-work of similar grade levels and duration. Furthermore, any religious organization which is barred from receipt of federal drug treatment funds by means of education and credentialing standards imposed by state or local government could appeal to the Secretary of Labor to waive such standards. The Secretary must waive the standards if:
<ul>
<p><li>The organization has provided effective drug treatment for at least three years;
<p><li>The Secretary determines the requirements for education and training of personnel effectively bar the organization from receipt of funds; and
<p><li>The state or local government is unable to demonstrate empirically that such qualifications are necessary to have a successful drug treatment program.
<p>
</ul>
<b>CREATING REAL JOBS IN POOR NEIGHBORHOODS</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Work Opportunity Tax Credit, found in Section 201 of Title II of the bill, is designed to encourage the employment and economic betterment of those whose past makes it difficult for them to secure a job and make a fresh start. The bill would replace the expired Targeted Jobs Tax Credit (TJTC). The Work Opportunity Tax Credit offsets the cost of hiring persons who fall into a number of categories, including AFDC or food stamp recipients and their families; economically disadvantaged veterans, ex-felons, and high-risk youth; vocational rehabilitation referrals; and qualified summer youth employees.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Employers would be eligible to claim a 35 percent credit on the first $6,000 of first-year wages paid to a qualifying individual (for a maximum credit of $2,100). In the case of certain summer youth, employers could claim a 35 percent credit on $3,000 of wages (for a maximum credit of $1,050).

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress has an opportunity to change the direction of American social policy. The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 contains a new comprehensive strategy to help resolve America's urban problems. It assumes that the choices and decisions of low-income Americans who want to help each other and themselves should be respected, is grounded in the experience of local organizations and community groups, and harnesses the initiative and genius of local institutions in an empowerment strategy that can work.
<p>
Specifically:<ul>

<p><li><b>The bill would reduce urban unemployment by reducing the tax and regulatory burden on businesses in inner-city areas.</b> This type of economic policy can reduce unemployment in affected localities by a third or more.

<p><li><b>The bill would expand educational opportunity by providing poor parents with scholarships which could be used to pay for tuition in private schools.</b> By giving poor parents the same sort of choice in education that middle-class families already have, the bill would increase parental involvement, improve the quality of education, and reduce the rate of school failure.

<p><li><b>The bill would help churches and religious institutions rebuild the moral foundations of inner cities by allowing poor parents to enroll their children in religious schools.</b> The authors of the bill recognize the simple and uncomplicated truth that the development of a strong moral character, reinforced by religious discipline and the habitual practice of virtue, is the necessary basis for success in school, in work, and in life itself. The church, as an institution, is society's most effective weapon in saving children from alcohol abuse, illegal drugs, violent crime, sexual promiscuity, illegitimacy, and dependence. By allowing inner-city churches, through a school choice program, to play a far greater and more decisive role in shaping the hearts and minds of America's young people, the Saving Our Children bill would be a large step forward in combating the social ills that plague America's inner cities.

<p><li><b>The bill would further encourage Americans from all walks of life to become more directly involved in the basic business of financing social service programs to help the poor.</b> It would expand the role of private-sector charity in aiding the poor. Federal, state, and local governments spend nearly $400 billion each year on a wide variety of programs to aid low-income Americans. By a wide margin, the public regards many, if not most, of these government programs as failures. By providing a generous tax credit for individual taxpayer donations to private charities which aid the poor, the Watts-Talent bill would enable the private sector, and religious charities in particular, to bring new and innovative local approaches to the struggle against poverty, drugs, family disintegration, and crime through programs that work and can make a real difference in the lives of young men and women.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The comprehensive urban policy embodied in the Saving Our Children bill gives Congress an excellent opportunity to make a bipartisan stand for children. It rejects the premise that all that is needed for our nation's poorest communities are larger benefit checks from the government. It goes beyond simply managing the symptoms of impoverishment to tackle the root causes of poverty, crime, and illegitimacy. It establishes the economic conditions which enable depressed communities to become more profitable places for work and business. And it recognizes and harnesses the positive energy of the nation's churches and religious institutions to advance the character and quality of American life.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States Supreme Court noted many years ago that "The primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition."<sup>3</sup>  And President Bill Clinton, in his 1994 State of the Union speech, declared that "We cannot renew our country until we realize that governments don't raise children, parents do."<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Congress is poised to give legislative form to these sentiments. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (S. 984 and H.R. 1946), introduced by Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) and Representative Steve Largent (R-OK), would give parents the standing in law to protect their rights to direct the education and to protect and form the moral character of their children. In fact, it would give them superior standing over government and its agencies in these matters: The bill declares that parents' rights to direct the upbringing of their children are fundamental rights which government can curtail only under conditions of "compelling interest" and under "strict guidelines" of judicial procedure, legal terms which guide courts in their decisions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congressional proponents of the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act contend that parental rights over the rearing of children are so basic that the Founders never even conceived of their being usurped by government. These rights, precisely because they are basic to the concept of liberty, should not be abridged by government except in the most unusual circumstances. They are liberty rights, protected by the Fifth Amendment. The bill would make this clear.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Parental rights concern the relationship between government -- federal, state, and local -- and parents in the raising of children. This area of civil liberties is the domain of Congress and the Supreme Court, with the Fourteenth Amendment clearly giving Congress the power to pass legislation to enforce such constitutional rights and protecting citizens against the abridgment of their rights by government:<blockquote>
	All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States....<sup>5</sup>
<p>
	The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.<sup>6</sup>
</blockquote><P>

<B>The Erosion of Parental Authority</B>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over the years, widely scattered and repeated attacks on the fundamental rights of parents have come from state and local courts; from federal, state, and local government bureaucracies and officials; and from policy initiatives inspired by a number of the major professions dealing with children. Certain members of these professions seem more concerned with displacing parents than with aiding them. In fact, the bill is opposed by many liberal groups wishing to change the relationship between government and the family, including the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the National Education Association.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While critics say the bill would cause confusion in child abuse and domestic relations law and procedure, congressional sponsors argue that child abuse is not a parental right and that they explicitly left all child abuse and domestic relations concerns outside the scope of the bill. These clearly are within the proper scope of state authority.
<P>

<B>WHAT THE BILL DOES</B>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 4 of the bill clarifies and codifies the rights of parents already affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court: "No Federal, State or local government, or any official of such a government acting under color of law, shall interfere with or usurp the right of a parent to direct the upbringing of the child of the parent."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

According to Section 3, the parent's right to direct the upbringing of a child includes the right to:
<UL>
<p><li><b>Direct or provide</b> for the education of the child;

<p><li><b>Make</b> a health or mental health decision for the child, with exceptions;<sup>7</sup>

<p><li><b>Discipline</b> the child, including reasonable corporal punishment as already defined by the Supreme Court; and

<p><li><b>Direct or provide</b> for the religious and moral formation of the child.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It also makes clear the procedure the courts must follow when these rights are to be denied by the state. The standard to which the courts must hold all levels of government in any move to deny parents their rights is laid out simply in Section 5:<blockquote>

	No exception to [the right] shall be permitted, unless the government is able to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence, that the interference or usurpation is essential to accomplish a compelling government interest and is narrowly drawn or applied in a manner that is the least restrictive means of accomplishing the compelling interest.</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This would establish a clear standard of judicial review whenever a state challenges parents. The government or its agencies would have to demonstrate a compelling interest in the contravention of parental authority. "Compelling interest" is a standard that demands "strict scrutiny" or "clear and convincing evidence" of the government's compelling and narrowly drawn interest in removing parental authority in the case before the court. It is the highest standard that can be adopted in a civil issue and is the traditional standard used by all when reviewing all other fundamental rights issues. If parental rights are fundamental, therefore, the "strict scrutiny" and "compelling interest" tests ought always to follow.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 7 specifically puts certain areas outside the scope of the bill, either because they properly are subject to state law or because they are not parental rights. These areas include the abuse or neglect of a child; domestic relations conflicts between parents, such as divorce and child custody battles; and adoption proceedings.
<p>

<b>Deference to States' Rights</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the United States, family law is made at the state level. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act therefore would uphold the role of the states in their relationship to families and parents by depriving no state of any power it retains under the federal Constitution. By clarifying the rights of parents, it would be a defense against intrusion into parental authority either by government (including legislatures, courts, and agency bureaucracies) or by professions acting as agents of government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As noted, the bill delineates the areas of state law within which it does not apply. Because family law, as opposed to individual rights, is the domain of the states, the bill does not change definitions in state family law. "The term `child' has the meaning provided by state domestic relations statute," for instance. "The term `parent' has the meaning provided by state domestic relations statute....  The term `direct upbringing of a child' shall not include abandonment, abuse and neglect as the terms have been defined in state statute."<sup>8</sup>  Furthermore, "Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit the ability of state or local governments from granting greater protection to parental rights."<sup>9</sup>
<p>

<b>THE NATURE OF PARENTAL RIGHTS</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under American constitutional law, "fundamental rights" are inherent in the person, and government at any level can abridge them only in cases of compelling state interest. The Constitution spells out or provides the basis for a number of such fundamental rights: free speech, freedom of religious practice, freedom from racial discrimination, freedom of the press. Many of these rights are spelled out in detail in statutes enacted by Congress pursuant to the Constitution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"Legal rights," by contrast, are not inherent in the person. They are granted by government and therefore can be altered or withdrawn by it. Social Security, Medicare, and welfare entitlements all are examples of legal rights.

<p>
<b>Parental Rights As Fundamental Rights</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is the settled view of the U.S. Supreme Court that parental rights are fundamental rights. In 1943, for example, the Court said:<blockquote>

	Constitutional interpretation has consistently recognized that the parents' claim to authority in their own household to direct the upbringing of their children is basic in the structure of our society. It is cardinal with us that the custody, care, and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary functions and freedom include preparations for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.<sup>10</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Supreme Court repeatedly has affirmed the fundamental nature of these rights, including the right to marry; to establish a home and bring up children;<sup>11</sup> to raise these children in their own fashion<sup>12</sup> (whether the children like the way they do it or not);<sup>13</sup> to direct the education of their children and to pass on to them their own principles, faith, and values;<sup>14</sup> to direct their children's religious and moral education;<sup>15</sup> to make medical decisions for their minor children;<sup>16</sup> and to inflict corporal punishment when it is deemed necessary.<sup>17</sup>  In cases as far apart in time as 1925 and 1979, the Court has declared that:<blockquote>

	Our jurisprudence historically has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor children. Our cases have consistently followed that course; our constitutional system long ago rejected any notion that a child is the "mere creature of the state" and, on the contrary, asserted that parents generally "have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare [their children] for additional obligations."

<p>
	The law's concept of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making life's difficult decisions. More important, historically it has recognized that natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interest of their children.

	<p>
	That some parents "may at times be working against the interest of their child"... creates a bias for caution, but is hardly a reason to discard wholesale those pages of human experience that teach that parents generally do act in the child's best interest. The statist notion that governmental power should supersede parental authority in all cases because some parents abuse and neglect children is repugnant to American tradition.<sup>18</sup>

	<p>
	[P]arents and guardians, as part of their liberty, might direct the education of children by selecting reputable teachers and places.
<p>
	The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the state to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not a mere creature of the state; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
	Simply because the decision of the parent is not agreeable to the child or because it involves risks does not automatically transfer the power to make that decision from the parents to some agency or officer of the state.... Most children, even in adolescence, simply are not able to make sound judgments concerning many decisions, including their need for medical care or treatment. Parents can and must make those judgments.<sup>20</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1972, the Supreme Court summed up its intent in these earlier rulings: "The primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition."<sup>21</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While parental rights are fundamental, however, they are not absolute. The Supreme Court has ruled repeatedly that states have the right to regulate the activities of family life for reasons of compelling state interest. Nonetheless, this governmental right is not unlimited. As the Court found in 1972, for example, "The state's interest in universal education, however highly we rank it, is not totally free from a balancing process when it impinges on fundamental rights and interests."<sup>22</sup>
<p>

<b>Complementary Roles of Congress and the Supreme Court</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fundamental rights under the U.S. Constitution are the domain of the federal government because they regulate the relationship between government -- all government -- and the citizen. Clarity on these rights results from their being spelled out in the Constitution, in Supreme Court rulings, in legislation passed by Congress, or in some combination of the work of these two branches of the federal government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Redundancy of affirmation of fundamental rights is frequent between Congress and the Supreme Court. This has been the case in the last few decades, for instance, with the right to freedom from racial discrimination. There is a rich history of such clarification underlying the fundamental rights of U.S. citizens. At times, the Supreme Court will correct Congress, as it did in <I>Brown v. Board of Education</I> in 1954, clarifying the right to segregation-free education.<sup>23</sup>  At other times, Congress will correct the Supreme Court, as it did with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, clarifying the right to freedom of religious practice.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Congress's responsibility to enforce the protection of fundamental rights is described in the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution:<blockquote>

	No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.... <sup>24</sup>
<p>
	The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.<sup>25</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In the event of confusion over the nature of fundamental rights, it is the federal government's responsibility to clarify or protect them. Congress did this with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Supreme Court did so in <I>Brown v Board of Education</I> in 1954. Both Congress and the Court also may act if one state upholds fundamental rights and another denies them (as happened in certain states which persisted in countenancing racial discrimination). With the Parental Rights and Responsibility Act of 1995, Congress would assume this task with respect to parents' rights.
<p>

<b>THE NEED TO RESTORE THE PRIMACY OF THE FAMILY</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The family is the indispensable institution of civil society; for it is the family that is primarily competent and responsible for developing the good character of children. When families are strong and function well, their children grow into adults who are truthful and responsible, and who practice private virtue and public citizenship. When families falter, their children grow into adults who can be vicious and irresponsible. Thus, because a free and civil society depends so utterly on the work of families, individuals take on extraordinary responsibilities when they become parents. As the bipartisan National Commission on Children observed in its final report in 1991:
<blockquote>
	The family is and should remain society's primary institution for bringing children into the world and for supporting their growth and development throughout childhood.... Parents are the world's greatest experts on their own children. They are their children's first and most important caregivers, teachers, and providers. Parents are irreplaceable, and they should be respected and applauded by all parts of society for the work they do.<sup>26</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As Urie Bronfenbrenner, professor of child psychology at Cornell University, has explained:
<blockquote>
	In order to develop -- intellectually, emotionally, socially, and morally -- a child requires participation in progressively more complex reciprocal activity, on a regular basis over an extended period in the child's life, with one or more persons with whom the child develops a strong, mutual, irrational emotional attachment and who is committed to the child's well-being and development, preferably for life.<sup>27</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is parents -- not teachers, child care providers, social workers, or a "village" -- that are most likely to give this all-encompassing commitment to the welfare of the child. This is not to denigrate the important work done by teachers, child care providers, and social workers, but simply to acknowledge an important truth: Only parents can reasonably be expected to put the interests of their children above their own. Thus, government must assume that parents, not bureaucrats or politicians, are in the best position to make decisions about their children because only parents can be expected to have this overriding commitment to their children's welfare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

This does not mean that all parents will put their children's interests above their own at all times. Indeed, some parents -- especially those who are under the influence of drugs like crack cocaine or alcohol -- even abuse their children physically or sexually. In such cases, the state can act to curtail the right of an individual parent or couple to care for a child. But the state can never lawfully curtail the fundamental rights of parents as a class; its duty is to uphold these rights. In all areas of public policy, government should assume that because parents are best able to make decisions about the welfare of their children, they must retain the maximum decision-making authority when it comes to raising those children. This is the underlying assumption of the Parents' Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995.

<p>
<b>WHY PARENTS' RIGHTS NEED TO BE CODIFIED</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are four reasons for codifying parental rights in law, even though the Supreme Court has ruled clearly on the issue in the past. First, certain legislatures have transgressed against parents. Second, there is evidence that these rights have been violated in the courts at lower federal and state levels. Third, state government agency actions sometimes violate these rights. Fourth, an increasing hostility to the fundamental rights of parents is evident in the activities of certain prominent members of the very "humane professions" (education, law, medicine, social work, and psychology) that are supposed to aid parents in the work of raising children.<ol>

<p><li><b>Legislative Threats.</b> State legislators have encroached on parents' rights. Though the courts or the people eventually have repelled these attacks, the very fact that such rights are subject to assault illustrates the danger. A few examples:<ul>

<p><li><b>Oregon.</b> In the 1920s, when the state of Oregon passed a law banning private schools, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the fundamental right of parents to choose the type of education they desire for their children:
<blockquote>
The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the state to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not a mere creature of the state; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.<sup>28</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nevertheless, a whole state government, including both chambers of the legislature, the governor, and the state judiciary, had attempted to violate the fundamental rights of parents as a group.

<p><li><b>Utah.</b> In 1980, the Utah legislature, with the governor concurring, passed an Amendment to the Children's Rights Act which changed the test by which parents could be denied the right to custody of their child. The old criterion of "unfit or incompetent" was supplanted by a new one: "the best interest of the child."  In 1982, however, the Utah Supreme Court rejected the new criterion because it would have allowed the state rather than the parent to determine what constitutes a child's "best interest":
<blockquote>
	[T]he 1980 amendment did not merely <I>refine or elaborate</I> the requirement that the parent be found "unfit or incompetent" in order to terminate his or her parental rights. Instead it <I>replaced</I> that subsection, and in doing so deleted a statutory protection for the parental rights of fit parents.... 
<p>
	No court is warranted in applying the "polar star [guiding] principle" of the welfare of the infant until the natural parents' rights have been lawfully severed and terminated.... 
<p>
	We are not aware that this Court has ever espoused the view, and it is not our view, that the termination of parental rights can be decreed without giving serious consideration to the prior and fundamental right of a parent to rear his child; and concomitantly, of the right of the child to be reared by his natural parent.<sup>29</sup>
</blockquote><p>
<li><b>The U.S. Congress.</b> In February 1994, Representative George Miller (D-CA), long-standing chairman of the House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families, introduced an amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (H.R. 6) that would have required a home schooling parent to be teacher-certified in any subject before being able to teach that subject to his or her child. This measure would have deprived parents of the hard-won recognition of their freedom to educate their children at home. Once the legislative threat became known, constituent phone calls to Congress reached historic levels,<sup>30</sup> illustrating the growing level of parental sensitivity to such encroachments. Thanks in large part to this public outrage, the Miller amendment failed by a vote of 382 to 53.
</ul><p>
<li><b>Judicial Threats.</b> Parental rights also have been threatened by the courts.
<ul>
<p><li><b>Massachusetts.</b> In 1995, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts affirmed the decision of the School Board of Falmouth to deny parents the ability to "opt out" of sex education classes and condom distribution for their children. The court further claimed that the freedom of parents was not violated because the children were not forced to take the condoms, the parents were free to tell their children to avoid the classes in question, and the children were free to avoid the classes if they chose.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The parents contended that the most critical and powerful element was missing from this formulation: the requirement that schools honor the parents' right to "opt out" even when their children did not want to do so. Thus, the ruling struck directly at parental authority. The court contended that the parents failed to demonstrate how their interests as parents were burdened by the school's condom or sex education programs. In other words, the state does not have to demonstrate "compelling state interest" when it decides to override the fundamental rights of parents; parents have to demonstrate unconstitutional interference by the state. The state is assumed to possess superior authority to direct the education and health of the child unless the parents can demonstrate otherwise.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

This ruling directly contradicts many other state court rulings on the same issue.<sup>32</sup>  Massachusetts parents thus do not have parental rights that are recognized in other states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In another notable case, the Massachusetts Supreme Court moved against parents who sought advance notification from the school so that they could exercise the "opt-out" provision.<sup>33</sup>  They contended that there was not much point in being able to "opt out" if they learned of the need only after the damage had taken place -- in this case, an AIDS awareness program conducted for the children by an outside consulting firm, "Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions Inc.," which included demonstrating the use of condoms and discussing many sexual acts traditionally regarded by parents as perverse and immoral.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both the federal district court and the federal circuit court found the Massachusetts parents' case to be without standing, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case. As a result, Massachusetts parents have no recourse from rulings of the Massachusetts Supreme Court. Both state and federal courts, in effect, have denied the existence of the parents' fundamental rights, and there is no legal procedure by which these parents can protect themselves from this violation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both of these rulings illustrate the need for Congress to clarify a right deemed fundamental in many states but not in all.


<p><li><b>Michigan.</b> In 1993, the Michigan Supreme Court issued two rulings on home schooling which illustrate that court's confusion with regard to parents' rights in education. According to the first, a set of parents has the right to home school their children because of their religious beliefs.<sup>34</sup>  But according to the second, another set of parents does not have the same freedom because, not claiming religious liberty principles, their rights to educate their children are controlled by the state of Michigan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In denying the "secular parents" their right to direct their children's education, the Michigan Supreme Court held "that a parent's Fourteenth Amendment right to direct a child's education is not one of those rights described by the United States Supreme Court as fundamental, and, thus, the strict scrutiny test is unwarranted."<sup>35</sup>  Thus, "religious" Michigan parents have a freedom to direct the education of their children that "secular" Michigan parents do not have. Michigan appears to have established a religious test for home schooling.

<p><li><b>Washington.<sup>36</sup></b> In 1980, the Supreme Court of the State of Washington ruled that it was not a violation of parents' rights to remove an eighth grade girl from her family. The parents had grounded her because she wanted to smoke marijuana and sleep with her boyfriend. She did not like her parents' rules, even though they were reasonably enforced, and asked the local child welfare agency to place her elsewhere.<sup>37</sup>  Rather than back the parents as the best way to correct the child's behavior, this agency honored the child's request that she be placed in someone else's home. One of the dissenting judges in the case described the situation:
<blockquote>
	They [the parents] asked their 15-year-old daughter not to use drugs, or associate with those who had furnished drugs, that she not use alcohol, that she not be sexually active, and that she be in at a reasonable hour. Because of the daughter's unwillingness to follow these obviously reasonable standards, these parents are summarily deprived of custody and the best opportunity to resolve these problems within the family.<sup>38</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

At no time did the state's lawyers contend that the parents' rules and their enforcement of them were unreasonable. Nor did they argue that the parents abused or neglected the child. The child simply wanted to avoid these restrictions, and the local child welfare agency and the courts backed her rather than her parents. Subsequently, the child's teenage and early adult years were extraordinarily troubled. Now an adult and mother herself, she sees the wisdom of her parents' approach and says that she wishes the local and state authorities had backed them instead of her.<sup>39</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Though the majority of the Washington Supreme Court denied the parents' rights (and in doing so differed clearly from both the Utah Supreme Court and the West Virginia Supreme Court), the three dissenting judges wrote:
<blockquote>
	There is no claim or proof [by the state] of unfitness or neglect by the parents. There was no claim of proof of any imminent threat of harm or danger to this 15-year-old.... Petitioning juvenile was asked at the court hearing the following: Q. "Could you please tell us why you believe there is a conflict in that home?"  A. "I just feel that there's a communication gap there."...  That is the sum and substance of the petitioner's testimony upon which she was taken from her parents' custody over their objections....  The court's justification for this extensive deprivation of fundamental parental rights consisted merely of conclusory findings of fact which met the unconstitutionally vague and inadequate standards of the statute.<sup>40</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Washington court's ruling was possible because of the lack of clear procedural legal guidelines for the denial of parental rights. This would not have happened if the court had been required to use the "compelling interest of the state" standard of review required by the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act now before Congress.
</ul>
<p><li><b>Threats from Boards and Bureaucrats.</b> Perhaps more than anything else, what has made parents increasingly aware of their fundamental rights is the frequent violation of these rights by state and local government officials.<ul>

<p><li><b>New York City.</b> The violation of parental rights can lead to confrontation. In 1992, one such dramatic and widely reported confrontation between parents and education authorities occurred over the teaching of "gay sex" in New York City's proposed "Rainbow Curriculum."  Despite hearings attended by hundreds of parents (and the declared opposition of tens of thousands more), the Board of Education pressed forward with its plans. While the voters ousted the offending board members shortly thereafter, the incident highlighted the depth of opposition to the fundamental right of parents to direct the education of their children, even in the area of intimate family-generating behavior.

<p><li><b>Virginia.</b> Sometimes the irony of this opposition escapes bureaucrats. In 1995, during a debate in Fairfax, Virginia, at a local school board meeting convened to vote on sex education, there was standing room only for parents, most of whom wanted something different from what the board intended to give them. School Superintendent Robert Spillane, annoyed with this supposed parental interference, complained: "You can see why parents should not be involved in family life education."<sup>41</sup>

<p><li><b>Maryland.</b> In 1996, a similar hearing in Montgomery County, Maryland, on the issue of "gay sex" in the public school curriculum evoked similar outrage from parents at open school board meetings. Again, the school board decided to disregard the parents' concern and go forward with the curriculum change. Maryland parents and students are not permitted to "opt out" of sexual education courses.

<p><li><b>Texas.</b> Many officials simply discount parental rights. One recent case involved a disagreement between parents and the Texas Board of Education on parents' access to standardized state test materials. When the lower court ruled in favor of the parents, the Texas Attorney General appealed the ruling. Though many might side with the school board on the particulars of the case, it is disturbing that the State Attorney General based his appeal on a rejection of the fundamental right of parents to direct the education and upbringing of their children.<sup>42</sup>

<P><LI><B>North Carolina.</b> In 1995, the county of Durham, North Carolina, drew up its own guidelines for judging the presence of child abuse. Though most of these "Minimum Standards of Care" make sense as indicators of potential child abuse, a number of them indicate a dangerous overreach by bureaucrats, who can claim authority to come into any home to check the suitability of parents. For instance, a parent may be investigated for "child abuse" if he confines a child to his room or violates any of a number of detailed government standards governing the supervision, nutrition, clothing, cleanliness, and even the bedtime of children. According to the Durham County Department of Social Services:
<blockquote>
 	The document reflects, to the extent possible under state law, the standards of care which the Durham community deems to be minimally acceptable for its children....  The period of supervision (baby-sitting by minors) must not extend beyond a reasonable bedtime: 9:00 p.m. for 12-14 year olds and midnight for 15-17 year olds.... Parent or caretaker insures proper hygiene by providing care, instruction, or necessary items for cleanliness (water, soap, toothbrush etc.).<sup>43</sup>
</blockquote>
These guidelines, undoubtedly drafted with the best of liberal intentions by the Department of Social Services, nonetheless reflect a desire to police parents. They are an excellent illustration of a trend described by Dr. Ed Zigler, Professor of Developmental Psychology at Yale University: the growing tendency to classify parental behaviors as abusive. "It's a terrible problem," says Professor Zigler. "I see an expansion of parental behaviors that are classified as abuse....  The whole area has become too subjective."<sup>44</sup>
</ul>
<p><li><b>Threats from Professionals.</b> Within the major professions of education, medicine, psychology, social work, and school counseling, there is increasing evidence that too many people and associations think they are more qualified than parents to judge what is good for particular children. There also is increasing evidence that they assume their professional judgment is superior and therefore can be exercised independently of parental judgment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The conception of the relationship between state and family held by many professionals is wholly unlike that held by most parents. The big contest is over the sexual morality of children. The work of Stanley Rothman and Richard Lerner, professors of sociology at Smith College and experts on the sociology of America's elites, points to a vast difference on matters related to sexual morality. Aside from wide discrepancies over the morality of abortion, Rothman and Lerner find "very large differences in the two groups' views regarding homosexuality, extra-marital and premarital sex, divorce, the ideal number of children in a family, voluntary suicide, and euthanasia."<sup>45</sup>  Differences between the therapeutic professions and the general population likewise are often stark. For instance, 72 percent of people generally describe religion as the most important influence in their lives,<sup>46</sup> while religion is much less important in the lives of the "mental health" elites.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In effect, the divisive politics of "family values" is basically a contest between most Americans and a relatively small elite whose members, because their ideology is estranged from the views of Americans generally, do not want parents to have the legal power to resist their attempts to impose on America's children a set of beliefs sharply different from those of their parents.
<ul>
<p><li><b>Medicine.</b> In East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, about 60 girls recently underwent a physical examination, including examination of the genitalia by a school nurse and doctor, without the permission of many of their parents. All the girls were 11 and 12 years old. Several objected, some started crying, and others asked to inform their parents. One of the girls said, "We tried to get out the windows but they pulled us back."<sup>47</sup>  Parents, understandably, were outraged.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Instead of operating according to a straightforward policy of obtaining written parental consent, the school simply assumed the right to conduct invasive medical examinations as long as there was nothing in writing to the contrary. And instead of seeing themselves as assisting parents in the work of raising children, school officials saw themselves as the locus of primary responsibility for the medical examination of other people's children. Rather than live by the Supreme Court's ruling that parents have the fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children, these officials apparently assumed the right was theirs. Pennsylvania law protects the school in its conduct of these examinations. In New York, however, a state health education teacher, contrasting the East Stroudsburg incident with practices in her school, said, "No child is ever touched without a permission slip. How dare they do this."<sup>48</sup>

<p><li><b>School Counseling.</b> Under the code of conduct for professional psychologists, those in private practice may not offer mental health services without the prior, informed consent of the child's parents.<sup>49</sup>  The law in this instance recognizes that no matter how much training a psychologist may have, he cannot substitute his judgment, arbitrarily and presumptively, for that of the child's parents. But school counselors have a very different situation: "The authors are not aware of any state or federal statutes requiring school counselors to obtain parent permission to counsel minors of any age.... "<sup>50</sup>

<p><li><b>Librarians.</b> By the nature of its work, the American Library Association is in the forefront in educating children. But the Association apparently sees the need to protect children from parents as a group, and stands firmly against parents' rights to direct the education of their children. Consider the following extract from the "ALA's Library Bill of Rights" discussing R-rated and X-rated videos:<blockquote>

Policies which set minimum age limits for access to videotapes... with or without parental permission, abridge library use for minors. MPAA [Motion Picture Association of America] and other rating services are private advisory codes and have no legal standings.... [T]o attempt to enforce such ratings through circulation policies or other procedures constitutes labeling, "an attempt to prejudice attitudes" about the material, and is unacceptable.<sup>51</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In some states, officials also have moved to undermine the right of parents to monitor and control their children's reading material. If a child has a library card, the state forbids library staff to answer parents' questions on what books their children have taken out of the library, no matter what the child's age. For example, Maryland state law declares that "a custodian shall prohibit inspection, use, or disclosure of a circulation record of a public library or other item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual...."<sup>52</sup>  This is reinforced elsewhere in the Maryland code: "a free association, school, college or university library in this State shall prohibit inspection, use or disclosure of any circulation record or other item, collection or grouping of information about an individual...."<sup>53</sup>  The code then lists the exceptions, none of which involves any recognition of the parents' right to direct the education of their minor children.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Safeguarding the confidentiality of library patrons is important to anyone concerned with the rights of individuals. But it is significant that in the development of reading by minors -- an area in which parents are the key players, recognized by the Supreme Court as the agents with the fundamental right to direct the education of their children -- libraries make no accommodation for parents and jealously guard against any parental intrusion. This has led to a bizarre situation in which parents, still financially responsible for books their children lose, are frustrated when they try to learn the names of these books so that they can search for them at home. Maryland public librarians may not tell them. But much more is at stake than this ludicrous inconvenience.

<p><li><b>The Education Establishment.</b> The gradual erosion of parents' standing in the eyes of the nation's powerful educational establishment is already far advanced, notwithstanding Supreme Court rulings to the contrary. Sammy Quintana, President of the National School Boards Association (NSBA), for example, denies the fundamental right of parents to direct the education of their children:
<blockquote>
	None would argue that active parental involvement in the care, upbringing, and education of our children is the cornerstone of a strong, healthy society....  This legislation could place federal judges in the position of requiring the school district to implement policy in conflict with the state's requirements. This is in direct disregard of the constitutionally recognized education function of the state.<sup>54</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In testimony on the bill before the House Committee on the Judiciary, Vicki Rafel, representing the National Parent Teacher Association, stated the NPTA's views on the relationship between parents, teachers, and other professions with similar bluntness:
<blockquote>
 	These institutions are not just part of a local community. They are also part of a total system of services and accountability that must be intertwined to provide an optimum environment for all children. Decisions affecting children should be made in a collaborative effort involving all the stakeholders including parents, educators, health care givers, and government bodies.<sup>55</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Rafel's testimony is striking because of what it does not affirm:
<blockquote>
	Since parents are their children's first teacher, we believe firmly that parents must be involved in every facet of their children's education. However, both the state and federal governments have responsibilities for the education of children. Parents and schools, working together as partners, make the best decision for children in the field of education.... From constitutional and historical perspectives, the states are primarily responsible for education. Under state laws, local school boards have a central role in providing education services with support from other governments.<sup>56</sup>
<p>
	We do not believe that any one single entity, operating outside of the collaborative framework [federal government, states, local school boards, and parents] can adequately address the educational needs of children.... <sup>57</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In other words, the National School Boards Association believes parents may be "involved" but that government officials enjoy the fundamental rights in education, and the National Parent Teacher Association denies the primary and fundamental right of parents in directing the education of their own children -- part of the same right the Supreme Court has described as "beyond debate as an enduring American tradition."
</ul></ol>
<p>
<b>INTERNATIONAL BUREAUCRATIC INTRUSIVENESS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On February 23, 1995, President Clinton signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which now awaits the advice and consent of the United States Senate. This Convention states that providing for the well-being of children is primarily the right of government. Article 3 establishes legal opposition between parent and child: "State Parties undertake to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary for his or her well-being, taking into account the rights and duties of his or her parents, legal guardians, or other individuals legally responsible for him or her, and, to this end, shall take all appropriate legislative and administrative measures."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

With respect to the rights and duties of parents, Article 5 declares that "State Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents... to provide... appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the present Convention."  In other words, parents have the right to guide their children's exercise of rights enumerated by the Convention. According to Article 3, for example, "The child shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of the child's choice."  In addition, "States recognize the rights of the child to freedom of association and to freedom of peaceful assembly."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The right of a minor to free association makes sense when it has parental sanction. But the universal right to free association outside of parental sanction leaves minor children open to exploitation by others, including those who challenge the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. Nowhere in the Convention is the right of the parent to direct such activity acknowledged. To the contrary, Article 15 states: "No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of these rights other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."  Thus, under the U.N. Convention, only the state may restrict the right of assembly of minors, as a group or as individuals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The idea of a child's right to privacy also has merit, especially when threats to this privacy come from outside the home. But given the clear responsibility of parents to direct their children's upbringing, the right to privacy articulated in the Convention is a threat to parental authority. While the overall themes of the Convention and many of its specific articles may be laudable, they are vitiated by the absence of any clear articulation of the rights of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. Worse, the Convention's language gives children a right superior to the rights of their parents: "States Parties [governments and government agencies] shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents... to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the present Convention."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

With its detailed elaboration of the rights of the child, coupled with the absence of any legal protection for the rights of parents against intrusive action by the state in the upbringing of children, the U.N. Convention is incompatible with traditional Western conceptions of the liberty of parents and with the U.S. Supreme Court's settled view of parental rights as "beyond debate."  Worse, the state is the only other entity whose rights are made clearly superior to the domestic life of the family as an institution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Parents should be very concerned over the dangerously intrusive impact of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. The reasons for this concern are indicated by a 1995 evaluation report from the United Nations to the government of Great Britain, a signatory to the Convention:
<blockquote>
	In relation to the implementation of article 12, the Committee is concerned that insufficient attention has been given to the right to the child to express his/her opinion, including in cases where parents in England and Wales have the possibility of withdrawing their children from parts of the sex education programmes in schools. In this as in other decisions, including exclusion from school, the child is not systematically invited to express his/her opinion and those opinions may not be given due weight, as required under article 12 of the Convention.<sup>58</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act does not specifically address the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, and Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, so far has blocked consideration by the Senate, this treaty is nonetheless a significant illustration of the thinking on the family among elites in government and the humane professions.
<p>

<b>QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE BILL
<p>

Q: Would the bill establish a new right?
<p>
A:</b> No. The right of parents to raise their children is not new. It is a basic liberty issue for all parents everywhere, in all times, and under all political conditions and regimes. The Supreme Court affirmed this ancient tradition in the jurisprudence of Western civilization over 70 years ago.
<p>
<b>Q: Would the bill grant ambiguous rights to parents?
<p>
A:</b> No. It denies ambiguous rights to government and to others acting on behalf of government. By applying the "compelling interest" clause to parents' rights, as is done with all other fundamental rights recognized under the Constitution, the bill curtails the ability of government officials to be ambiguous or arbitrary in their dealings with parents. When "overriding" the fundamental rights of parents (as it can, for parents' rights are not absolute), the state must do so in a very narrowly defined and defensible fashion. The same principle holds for all other groups and professions in their relations with parents and children.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill violate the "rights of the child?"
<p>
A:</b> No. The rights of children and parents are complementary. Children have the right to be formed as competent human beings by those who brought them into the world, and parents have the right to develop these capacities in their children. Parents give their children life and continue to influence the development of their children's individuality through their actions as parents. In developing this individuality, which includes intellectual and moral capacities, parents are fulfilling natural rights and responsibilities that not only are an essential component of the Western concept of the individual liberty of the parent, but also are recognized as fundamental under the federal Constitution. Parental exercise of these rights does not violate the child's rights; it fulfills them.
<p><B>
Q: Would the bill eliminate the "best interest of the child" criterion in public policy?
<p>
A:</b> No. It would make the parent the arbiter of the child's best interest. This also is the position of the United States Supreme Court. The community can affect parents' conception of what is in their children's best interest, but children are the progeny of their parents, brought into existence by them, and naturally subject to the parent's conception of what is in their best interest.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill breach the confidentiality of professional counseling relationship in school settings?

A:</b> No. There is a difference between establishing a professional-minor relationship and preserving the confidentiality of that relationship once established. The bill would do nothing to alter the confidentiality of professional relationships. Confidentiality is a sine qua non of a therapeutic relationship and is widely understood as such. The bill would clarify the process through which such a confidential relationship is established: No professional could enter into such a relationship with a minor without the express permission of the parent, for it is the parent's right, not the professional's, to decide what is in the best interest of the child. The bill would make no difference to many of the therapeutic professions, including psychology and psychiatry, for this already is their established ethic.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Other professions, however, are less explicit in their ethics or professional guidelines. According to the American Counseling Association's professional code of ethics, "When counseling minors or persons unable to give voluntary informed consent, counselors act in the client's best interest."<sup>59</sup>  By contrast, consider the guideline of the American Psychological Association: "When persons are legally incapable of giving informed consent, psychologists obtain informed permission from a legally authorized person, if such a substitute consent is permitted by law."<sup>60</sup>  There is a very big difference between the two: Psychologists defer to parents as the arbiters of their children's best interests in establishing the relationship; school counselors try to claim that right for themselves.
<p>

Parents send their children to school to be taught, not to be counseled one-on-one in private professional settings guarded by the rules of confidentiality, unless these relationships are expressly established in cooperation with the parent. Any relationship with a minor that is guarded by confidentiality should be contingent upon the prior written permission of the parent. The very presence of a confidentiality requirement is a signal that there is a need for the express permission of the parent. Under the laws of certain states, older children who also are unemancipated minors may enter into such confidential relationships without their parents' permission. But state laws often prescribe the ages and describe the situations in which these minors may do so.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill violate the principle of federalism?
<p>
A:</b> No. The Fourteenth Amendment grants Congress explicit authority to legislate to protect the fundamental rights of citizens. Congress and the Supreme Court are the two venues in which this legal clarification takes place. It cannot be done at the state or local level.
<p><b>
Q: Does the bill not threaten and weaken parental rights by involving Congress and the federal courts in family issues?
<p>
A:</b> No. The liberty of parents increasingly is being violated by government agencies and professions acting under government agency authority and protection. Congress and the Supreme Court are the only two institutions which can articulate parental rights in ways that bind all levels of government. Moreover, Congress has the constitutional ability to correct the Supreme Court. Though the Court has articulated parents' fundamental rights, these rights still need to be operationalized by the clear articulation of "compelling interests, narrowly drawn" when the rights of parents are to be set aside. This is not currently the criterion, and its absence is the main reason for the erosion of parents' liberty in the moral formation of their children.
<p><b>
Q: Would this legislation impose an unfunded mandate on the states?
<p>
A:</b> No. Guaranteeing the fundamental rights of citizens is not an unfunded mandate. It is a fundamental duty of each state's judicial system. Section 422 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 states clearly that "this part shall not apply to any provision in a bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report before Congress that (1) enforces constitutional rights of individuals...."  Furthermore, the state and its bureaucracies, as the main violators of these rights, can avoid such costs simply by not infringing on the fundamental rights of parents.
<p>
<b>Q: Would codifying the fundamental rights of parents allow parents to sue in both federal and state court systems?
<p>
A:</b> Yes. As a fundamental right, it can be violated at any level, including the federal. Also, violations at the state court level (and there are many instances of these) are properly appealable at the federal court level, as are violations of all other fundamental rights under the federal Constitution.
<p><b>
Q: Would the codification of parents' fundamental rights be a bonanza for trial lawyers?
<p>
A:</b> No. By clearly defining these fundamental rights and establishing a compelling interest test, the bill would reduce the number of cases moving to litigation. It is the absence of this clarity that contributes to the current flood of litigation in local, state, and federal courts.
<p><b>
Q: Would the cost of enforcement be prohibitive?
<p>
A:</b> No. The National Education Association, which openly defends violations of the fundamental rights of parents, says the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act would cost $3.3 billion per year. Even if the NEA's exaggerated estimates were correct, however, such a demand for fiscal conservatism is odd coming from the NEA. According to one recent estimate, the NEA's own legislative agenda would cost the American taxpayer $700 billion.<sup>61</sup>
<p><b>
Q: Could parents use codification to challenge welfare reform?
<p>
A:</b> No. Welfare entitlements are legislative grants, not fundamental individual rights. The state may attach requirements to such grants, but only insofar as they do not violate fundamental rights.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill permit parents to use child labor to supplement family income?
<p>
A:</b> No. The U.S. Supreme Court has established the right of the state to regulate parents in the matter of child labor, an evil against the child. This bill would do nothing to contravene this state right; nor would it allow parents to deprive their children of the minimum of education required by the state. According to the Supreme Court, "It is cardinal... that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first with the parents.... [T]he family itself is not beyond regulation in the public interest.... [L]egislation appropriately designed to reach such evils [as child labor] is within the state's police power."<sup>62</sup>
<p>
<b>Q: Would defining parents' fundamental rights hinder states in their task of protecting children from child abuse?
<p>
A:</b> No. No parent has a right to abuse a child. When such abuse happens, the state, acting on the child's behalf, has a duty to protect the child. The truth is that this bill would reinforce the right of states to protect children from abuse. A much greater threat to the state's ability to protect abused children is the "family preservation philosophy" in child care social work, which leads to repeated efforts to reunite the child with an abusive family in the hopes that eventually the parents will improve. By failing to heed the evidence of abuse, this approach frequently places the child in grave danger. In 1992, in New York City, 21 children were killed by a parent or a mother's boyfriend after the Child Welfare Administration had intervened. Both Arizona and Oregon have instituted special units to investigate severe child abuse situations to help the courts move quickly to terminate the parental rights of such abusing parents, and to rescue the children.<sup>63</sup>  This bill would pose no threat to such action by states or local governments, but by the clarity of its statements on child abuse could be cited in support of such actions.
<p><b>
Q: Would codifying the fundamental rights of parents endanger the right of states to guarantee public health by such means as school vaccinations and other public health interventions?
<p>
A:</b> Not at all. The Supreme Court has established the role of the states in safeguarding public health.
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't people who suspect child abuse be disinclined to report their suspicions?
<p>
A:</b> Far from it. The bill makes clear that no one acting to protect a child from abuse can be subjected to a lawsuit based on such action.
<p><b>
Q: Would parents be able to impede investigations of child abuse by the state?
<p>
A:</b> No. The bill specifically leaves all state child abuse state laws unaffected. The states would retain the duty to protect children who are being abused.
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't the corporal punishment clause give parents a license to abuse their children or encourage them in the use of abusive punishment?
<p>
A:</b> No. All states currently allow "reasonable corporal discipline," and the Supreme Court has ruled that even school authorities may use "such corporal punishment as is reasonably necessary for the proper education and discipline of the child."<sup>64</sup>  Thus, both state law and the Supreme Court have affirmed that parents and schools may use reasonable corporal punishment.
<p><b>
Q: Would defining fundamental parents' rights overturn state compulsory education laws and prohibit state regulation of home schooling?
<p>
A:</b> No. The Supreme Court has ruled that the state has an interest in establishing compulsory attendance laws and regulating education.<sup>65</sup>  The Court also has stated that parents must demonstrate to the state that their alternative education is appropriate, both in standards of literacy and in terms of the child's eventual self-sufficiency, and has reaffirmed that states may set educational standards for children within their borders.
<p><b>
Q: Would this bill pit school boards and parents against each other?
<p>
A:</b> No. The essence of the American tradition of control by local school boards is to encourage parents to play a full role in the direction of their schools. All this bill would do is create an official atmosphere more sensitive to parents' views. Where these views cannot be accommodated, especially in cases involving sensitive moral issues, parents would have the freedom to withdraw their children from controversial classes.
<p><b>
Q: Would the bill require schools to provide individual tuition or curricula whenever a student's parents disagree with curriculum content?
<p>
A:</b> No. The Supreme Court has ruled that local school boards have the right to set curricula, and the federal courts have held that for the federal judiciary to intervene on behalf of parents, those parents must establish that their constitutional rights have been violated.<sup>66</sup>
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't the bill require alternative curricula for each race or religion, overturn curriculum decisions, overturn decisions on textbooks, remove free inquiry from the classroom, and forbid mandatory graduation requirements?
<p>
A:</b> No. Establishing the fundamental right of parents to direct the education of their children, as well as their religious and moral formation, does not diminish the right of the community, as represented in its local school board, to act on all these issues. The Supreme Court recognized these local community rights in 1988,<sup>67</sup> affirming the school's right to teach even curricula opposed to the beliefs or values of parents. According to the Court, this does not violate the parents' rights; at the same time, however, for the school board to require the student to act on these values would violate the student's rights.
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't codifying these fundamental parental rights lead people to use the courts as a solution of first rather than last resort, and cause money to be diverted from the classroom to the courtroom?
<p>
A:</b> No. With the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, religious parents gained the heightened scrutiny standard of "compelling state interest."  Under the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, all parents would benefit from this standard. There has been no diversion of discussion and energy from classroom to courtroom under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act; rather, official sensitivity and discussion increase when these issues arise. If parents raised ridiculous claims under the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, their cases would be thrown out of court. The Supreme Court has established school board rights as well. Frivolous litigation would be costly for parents and of no benefit to them.
<p><b>
Q: Would codifying the fundamental rights of parents force local bodies to pay for private or sectarian tuition?
<p>
A:</b> No. Repeated Supreme Court decisions show that the state does not have to pay either for services a person may freely choose in law or for services (such as private education and health care) to which the law may not deny access.
<p><b>
Q: Wouldn't the bill move authority over education to the federal government?
<p>
A:</b> No; quite the opposite. By codifying the fundamental nature of parental rights, it would strengthen the hand of parents in dealing with government, whether federal, state, or local. It also would increase dialogue at the local level and ensure greater sensitivity to parents' rights on the part of government officials.
<p><b>
Q: Does the bill threaten the rights of girls to receive education on contraception and abortion?
<p>
A:</b> Parents have the fundamental right to direct the moral formation of their children. They also have the right to protect their children from behavior that is immoral in their eyes. In a society deeply divided on what is moral and what is immoral, mainly in the area of sexual morality, either school officials would refrain from entering this area of moral teaching (as they do already with respect to religious teaching), or parents would have the clear right to opt out from the official imposition of "values" hostile to their beliefs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The bill would give parents on both sides of these and other sensitive issues the ability to exercise their right and duty to direct the moral formation of their children as they see fit. Government officials have no right to form moral beliefs in children that contradict the beliefs of parents. According to the Supreme Court government officials are not obliged to teach the sexual morality that parents want taught, but neither do they have any right to teach children a sexual morality opposed to that of their parents.

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The rights of parents as a group are disregarded or endangered all too frequently by government officials. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act would codify a fundamental right already articulated by the Supreme Court. It is needed because of repeated threats to parents' rights from the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government at all levels -- federal, state, and local -- and from the humane professions. The bill is consistent with a tradition of freedom long recognized by the Supreme Court. It also is appropriate to the federal legislative process, because it articulates a fundamental right that applies to all American citizens in relation to all levels of government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There has been a disturbing pattern over the past century. Child rearing in America increasingly has come to be viewed as a public matter, a matter for the national "village."  As early as 1901, the Indiana State Supreme Court, in a ruling upholding the state's compulsory education law, stated that "The natural rights of a parent to the custody and control of his children are subordinate to the power of the state."<sup>68</sup>  In 1960, writing in the professional journal <I>Child Welfare</I>, one social worker noted that "daycare can offer something valuable to children because they are separated from their parents."<sup>69</sup>  Today, believing that government is in the best position to ensure the well-being of children, many take it for granted that government should have great authority over their upbringing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because of the persistent danger to the fundamental rights of parents from state court rulings, professional associations, government bureaucracies, the educational establishment, and international agencies and bodies, it is clear that these rights need codification in law. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, sponsored by Senator Grassley and Representative Largent, would do just that, erecting a barrier against the mounting erosion of these rights. In an increasingly fragmented and hostile culture, American parents deserve to have their liberty and legitimate rights established as clearly in law as they were in the assumptions of those who founded the American Republic.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Latin America has bounced back from the economic meltdown caused by the Mexican peso on December 20, 1994, but the United States has not. The democracies of Latin America have stayed on course with free-market reforms, trade liberalization policies, and efforts to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). However, the U.S. appears to have turned its back on Latin America. As free trade has faded from the foreign policy agendas of both the Clinton Administration and the 104th Congress, U.S. relations with Latin America have deteriorated significantly. On issues such as Cuba, drug trafficking, illegal immigration, and even the creation of the FTAA, America today is increasingly at odds with important hemispheric trading partners such as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

America's flight from enlarging the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has damaged U.S. leadership and economic interests in the Western Hemisphere, but hemispheric trade expansion has not been interrupted. Mexico has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with Chile, Bolivia, and Costa Rica, is negotiating its association with the South American Common Market (Mercosur),<sup>1</sup> and soon will launch trade negotiations with the European Union. Chile recently became an associate of Mercosur and is negotiating a bilateral FTA with Canada. Other countries interested in joining Mercosur include the five members of the Andean Community.<sup>2</sup>  Mercosur also wants to sign an FTA with the European Union. Clearly, no one is waiting for America to climb back aboard the free trade express in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From 1980-1992, the Reagan and Bush Administrations established the closest and strongest relationship with Latin America that the U.S. has enjoyed in more than a century. The bases of this new hemispheric partnership were democracy and the creation of a hemispheric free trade area, as provided for in the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI) and the NAFTA.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But since 1993, the Clinton Administration has dissipated the achievements of more than a decade by pursuing a policy of neglect and indifference toward Latin America. Since the collapse of the Mexican peso at the end of 1994, NAFTA has become a political football for politicians who claim that free trade is the cause of such domestic problems as increased drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Instead of responding by making a strong case for NAFTA, however, some previously strong supporters of free trade have scaled back their support for its enlargement, and for the FTAA process in general. America's retreat from NAFTA's expansion is hurting American consumers and workers, undermining U.S. economic interests in Latin America, and weakening U.S. leadership in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If this situation is not reversed, U.S. interests in Latin America could suffer lasting damage. To regain America's leading role in the FTAA process and heal the recent rifts in U.S. relations with Latin America, the U.S. Administration should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Approve a new fast-track negotiating authority.</b> Without fast-track, U.S. participation in and influence at the third post-Summit of the Americas Trade Ministerial, to be held during the second quarter of 1997 in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte, will be marginal at best.
<p>
<li><b> Expand NAFTA during 1997 to include Chile.</b> The accession of Chile to NAFTA would reaffirm America's commitment to an FTAA with Latin America and the Caribbean, open a new gateway for U.S. exports in South America and the nations of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC), and provide America with valuable strategic leverage in future convergence talks with Mercosur.
<p>
<li><b>Include the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries in NAFTA.</b><sup>3</sup> H.R. 553, stalled in Congress since 1995, would improve market access for U.S. exports to Caribbean and Central American markets. It also would require CBI beneficiaries to strengthen rules relating to investment, labor standards, and the environment, among other improvements that strongly favor U.S. interests.
<p>
<li><b>Launch a dialogue to integrate NAFTA and Mercosur.</b> The goal of such talks should be to deepen and harmonize trade disciplines between NAFTA and Mercosur as both groups take on new members; the ultimate objective should be to merge these two regional groups into a single hemispheric FTAA by 2005.
<p>
<li><b>Define a pathway and timetable for creating the FTAA.</b> Western Hemisphere nations should define quickly whether the FTAA will include commitments that go beyond those already made in NAFTA and the World Trade Organization (WTO). America should insist on FTAA trade disciplines that improve on NAFTA and the WTO.
<p>
<li><b>Implement reforms that do not require negotiations,</b> including unilateral cuts in tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, simplification and harmonization of existing rules and regulations affecting the flow of goods and services in the region, removal of barriers to trade in services, enactment of world-class protection for intellectual property rights, and revision of investment regulations.
<p>
<li><b>Establish separate negotiations on issues unrelated to free trade,</b> such as drug trafficking, corruption, illegal immigration, labor standards, and preserving the environment. The action plan approved at the Summit of the Americas on December 11, 1994, outlines such a framework; in practice, however, the Clinton Administration has sought consistently to establish conditions and linkages between free trade and other issues. As a result, tensions between the U.S. and Latin America have increased in the past two years, and U.S. leadership and credibility have suffered.
<p>
<li><b>Negotiate FTAs with New Zealand, Singapore, and Australia.</b> The negotiation of bilateral free trade agreements with these countries could create momentum for the convergence of the FTAA and APEC processes into a single free trade area encompassing more than 2 billion consumers.
<p>
<li><b>Convene a second Summit of the Americas in 1997.</b> Strong leadership is required to prevent regionalism from derailing the FTAA process. The goals of a second Summit of the Americas should include creation of a WTO-type entity to advance negotiations, expansion of FTAA technical working groups to propose policies and specific actions, and a commitment by all democracies in the Western Hemisphere to a specific timetable and pathway for launching the FTAA by 2005.
<p>
<li><b>Dismantle domestic U.S. barriers to free trade.</b> U.S. protectionism is the greatest impediment to free trade and creation of an FTAA.

<b>TRADE POLICY BLUNDERS IN LATIN AMERICA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The greatest failure of U.S. Latin American policy in recent years has been in the area of trade policy. The U.S. no longer leads the Western Hemisphere FTAA process, primarily because the Clinton Administration has chosen to retreat from free trade and NAFTA's enlargement rather than defend the trade pact's record of success. As a result, the FTAA process has lost momentum and the U.S. has surrendered leadership and negotiating advantage to Brazil, which has tilted the FTAA process toward the enlargement of Mercosur into a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA) centered on Brazil and capable of challenging U.S. economic interests and leadership in the Americas.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This retreat from free trade is severely damaging to U.S. relations with Latin America, not to mention economic and security interests in the Western Hemisphere. Without the goodwill and greater economic interaction that come with increased trade and investment, it will be more difficult for the U.S. and Latin America to develop and implement effective policies for managing such hemispheric problems as drug trafficking, corruption, illegal immigration, and environmental destruction. Moreover, Washington's reluctance to expand NAFTA means that American companies and workers risk missing out on the fast-paced trade expansion occurring today throughout Latin America. Opportunities missed by U.S. companies will be seized by investors from other countries. Exports, jobs, and wealth creation possibilities lost in Latin America by U.S. firms will accrue to others.
<p>

<b>NAFTA: TWO YEARS OF SOLID GROWTH</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since the peso's collapse on December 20, 1994 -- only nine days after the Summit of the Americas concluded in Miami -- critics of NAFTA have been claiming that the trade pact is a failure. Many critics also blame NAFTA for the growing problems of drugs, illegal immigration, and declining real wages in U.S. manufacturing. But NAFTA did not cause the Mexican peso crisis and is not responsible for America's social problems. Moreover, far from being a failure, NAFTA has scored some impressive trade and investment successes during its first two years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
NAFTA helped Mexico overcome the peso crisis. The international obligations created by NAFTA and by Mexico's membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) enabled the embattled government of Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo to rebuff intense political pressure to roll back Mexico's economic reforms after the peso collapsed. As a result, the Mexican economy now is recovering from the crisis, although years will pass before per capita income returns to pre-peso crisis levels.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During NAFTA's first two years, trade and foreign direct investment among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada have increased. Since 1994, the average U.S. tariff on Mexican products has fallen from 3.5 percent to 1.5 percent, while average Mexican tariffs on U.S. products have dropped from 10 percent to 4.9 percent. As a result, trade among the three NAFTA countries rose by 17 percent in 1994 to $350 billion, and bilateral U.S.-Mexico trade grew by 20.7 percent, surpassing $100 billion for the first time.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1995, despite the recession caused by the peso's collapse, overall U.S.-Mexico trade increased 8 percent to $108 billion, while total intra-NAFTA trade grew 10.6 percent to $380 billion.<sup>5</sup>  Moreover, after declining by 8.9 percent in 1995 to $46.3 billion, U.S. exports to Mexico increased by 12.1 percent during the first three months of 1996, compared with the same period in 1995.<sup>6</sup>  More than 75 percent of all U.S. states reported a rise in exports to Mexico during the first quarter of 1996.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico during 1995 totaled $33.49 billion, compared with a 1994 trade deficit of $14.69 billion with Canada and a trade surplus of $1.34 billion with Mexico. Critics have used these figures to defend their claim that NAFTA is costing jobs in America. The reason Mexico imported fewer U.S. goods in 1995, however, is simply that the peso's collapse reduced the buying power of the Mexican people by more than 50 percent, and poorer people buy fewer goods. Americans consumed more Mexican products in 1995 because the average American is much wealthier than the average Mexican. The truth is that more jobs in America today rely on imports than exports, since nearly 90 percent of American manufacturers utilize imported materials or components in their production.<sup>8</sup>  Moreover, the $80 billion jump in three-way trade during the first two years of NAFTA's implementation added over 1.6 million new jobs to the North American economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
NAFTA is restructuring the North American economy as firms in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada create cross-border enterprises that lower manufacturing costs, improve productivity, and expand the volume and diversity of products at lower prices for consumers in all three countries. A recent study by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) found that half of Mexico's total exports to the U.S. are manufactured by U.S.-owned firms, or by production-sharing partnerships<sup>9</sup> whose products have an average U.S. content of 50.2 percent, compared with 35.3 percent for Canada, 32 percent for Taiwan, and 27.8 percent for Korea. As the output of Mexico-based co-production ventures increases, the volume and value of U.S.-made inputs imported by Mexican firms also increase, creating more jobs in America. Moreover, the rise in U.S.-Mexico co-production ventures is diverting investment away from alternative co-production sites in Asia. In 1994, Mexico was America's largest production-sharing partner, accounting for $22.9 billion, or 39.1 percent of all U.S. co-produced imports.<sup>10</sup>  U.S.-Mexico production partnerships increasingly play a prominent role in such key industries as motor vehicles, auto parts, computers, televisions and other electrical products, and textiles and apparel, among others.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>NAFTA Aiding Mexico's Recovery.</b> Only 18 months after the peso's collapse, the Mexican economy is showing signs of a promising, if uneven, recovery. Following five consecutive quarters of decline, the Mexican economy grew sharply during the second quarter of 1996 as real gross domestic product (GDP) rose 7.2 percent compared with the second quarter of 1995. For all of 1996, Mexico is expected to grow about 3 percent, compared to a contraction of 6.9 percent in 1995.<sup>11</sup>  Moreover, despite a 22 percent rise in the peso against key currencies during the first seven months of 1996, Mexican exports of manufactured goods have gained 22.8 percent, while imports have increased 22.1 percent.<sup>12</sup>  Nevertheless, about 70 percent of all economic activity in Mexico is tied to the domestic economy, which may not feel the overall, export-driven economic upturn for at least another year.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Political and social instability have increased in Mexico as a result of the economic crisis, the spread of drug trafficking, a weak judiciary incapable of fighting corruption, and entrenched political and economic dinosaurs that continue to block democratic reform and true economic freedom. However, NAFTA is not responsible for Mexico's current social and political difficulties. In fact, NAFTA has provided Mexico with a strong anchor and a stable point of institutional reference on the road to true capitalist democracy. Meanwhile, there is reason to be optimistic about Mexico's political future.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Impressive Growth in U.S.-Canada Trade.</b> Canadian exports to the U.S. and Mexico have risen impressively since NAFTA was implemented. Foreign investment in Canada from all sources also has increased significantly. In 1995, two-way trade between the U.S. and Canada grew nearly 12 percent to $272 billion, while total foreign direct investment in Canada increased by 10 percent to $168 billion. The U.S. is the largest foreign investor in Canada. Direct investment in Canada by American firms increased by 11 percent to $113 billion in 1995, representing 67 percent of total foreign direct investment in Canada. Similarly, the U.S. remains the destination for the largest share of Canadian foreign direct investment, with a total of $76.5 billion invested.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Canada's exports in 1994 represented 30.1 percent of its total GDP, compared to 21.6 percent in 1991. Canada's strong export performance during the 1990s was closely related to the growth in Canadian exports to the U.S., and Canadian production of goods for international markets is closely linked to the U.S. through the intra-firm trading of U.S.-controlled firms operating in Canada.<sup>14</sup>  Transactions between related firms account for 57 percent of Canadian exports to the U.S., and 72 percent of exports by U.S.-con-trolled Canadian firms are related-party transactions. According to one survey, "U.S.-controlled [multinational companies] are responsible for the largest share of sales by the Canadian manufacturing and wholesale firms studied, and account for the largest share of their imports and exports."  Overall, the Canadian economy is "linked intra-regionally to the U.S. economy."<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>A Hemispheric Free Trade Emporium.</b> When Mexico defaulted on its external debt obligations in 1982, it triggered the Latin American debt crisis and plunged the region into a decade of negative growth and falling per capita income. However, when the Mexican peso collapsed in December 1994, Latin America was hardly affected. Economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean slowed to 0.8 percent in 1995 as the effects of the Mexican peso crisis rippled through the region's financial markets. However, U.S. exports to Latin America and the Caribbean rose to $102 billion in 1995, up 12 percent from 1994 and 72 percent higher than total U.S. exports to the region in 1990. Although individual countries such as Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico are struggling to resolve diverse economic, political, and social difficulties, the region overall has shrugged off the aftershocks of the Mexican peso crisis.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The World Bank predicts that Latin America and the Caribbean will grow by 3.1 percent in 1996 and 4 percent in 1997, with Chile leading the region at 6.5 percent this year while Venezuela lags at 0.5 percent.<sup>16</sup>  The bank also predicts that average GDP growth should rise to 3.8 percent in 1996-2005, compared to average growth of 2.4 percent during the past decade.<sup>17</sup>  Free trade and foreign direct investment are driving the region's growth. Latin America's exports and imports increased rapidly as tariff barriers dropped from 50 percent a decade ago to 12 percent in 1993, one year before NAFTA went into effect. For years, U.S. exports to Latin America have increased twice as rapidly as exports to any other region of the world. Intra-regional trade between Latin American countries and trade with Asia also are growing rapidly. For example, intra-Mercosur trade doubled in four years to $15.8 billion and today accounts for 22 percent of the group's total world trade, up from 14.3 percent in 1992.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some World Bank economists believe that Latin America can achieve annual growth rates of 6 to 6.5 percent within a decade if governments in the region raise exports significantly by avoiding overvalued exchange rates; increasing investments for infrastructure such as roads, ports, and telecommunications; and attracting larger amounts of foreign direct investment.<sup>18</sup> However, while democracy, hemispheric economic integration, and trade expansion are progressing rapidly, Latin American and Caribbean countries are still struggling to resolve a host of structural impediments to faster growth and greater stability and economic prosperity. Economic reforms have not advanced sufficiently anywhere in the region, including Chile, which is routinely hailed as Latin America's star performer. The widespread absence of economic freedom is reflected in the region's high levels of poverty, illiteracy, and illegal immigration. Judicial systems are generally weak, politicized, and corrupt. Effective legal protection for individual property rights does not exist. Moreover, drug traffickers have emerged in the 1990s as major threats to the stability of countries such as Colombia and Mexico. Organized violence by subversive guerrilla organizations is increasing in Colombia, Peru, and Mexico.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The difficulties confronting Latin America and the Caribbean today defy easy or quick solutions. They represent both a daunting challenge to the region's expectations for a brighter economic future and a threat to U.S. economic and national security interests. The Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, NAFTA, and Free Trade Area of the Americas were proposed by the U.S. as the foundations of a hemispheric partnership and a new American Century based on democracy, free trade, and the economic integration of the U.S. and Latin America. This vision has not been realized. Nine days after the FTAA was launched at the Summit of the Americas in Miami, the Mexican peso collapsed and the U.S. retreated from NAFTA's enlargement.
<p>
<b>TEN INITIATIVES FOR RESTORING U.S. LEADERSHIP TO THE FREE TRADE AREA OF THE AMERICAS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The failure to enlarge NAFTA to involve Chile and the Caribbean countries during 1995 was a major setback for U.S. economic and security interests in Latin America and the Caribbean. The momentum and direction of the FTAA process have changed significantly since the Mexican peso crisis. Brazil has filled the vacuum in the FTAA process created by America's retreat from free trade, and has won regional support for an alternative trade agenda that sidelines a NAFTA/WTO-plus process to create the FTAA in favor of a more limited regional approach based on the expansion of Mercosur to create a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA) centered on Brazil. Brazil also favors negotiating a trade pact with the European Union before engaging the U.S. in talks to establish a framework for the future merger of Mercosur and NAFTA into an FTAA.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although Mercosur has its share of internal problems that could slow its expansion, the process is well underway. Chile has become an associate of Mercosur, and Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador expect to join before the end of 1996. Mexico is negotiating an agreement with Mercosur while simultaneously blocking U.S. and Canadian efforts to launch early talks between NAFTA and Mercosur. The proposed enlargement of Mercosur and creation of a SAFTA appeals to many Latin American politicians, intellectuals, and business leaders who support higher levels of protectionism and the notion of a united Latin American front capable of maintaining its economic and political independence from U.S. pressure and interference. Latin American integration is one of the oldest dreams in the region, and it is closer to being achieved today than ever before. Meanwhile, as the free trade express in Latin America picks up speed, the U.S. lags behind even the caboose.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new U.S. partnership with Latin America celebrated by President Clinton at the Summit of the Americas has developed serious cracks. For example, entities such as the Rio Group and the Organization of American States (OAS) have condemned the U.S. for enacting the Helms-Burton Act against Cuba and for decertifying Colombia in the war on drugs. U.S. policy against Cuba also has raised tensions significantly with NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada. Mexico has attacked recent changes in U.S. immigration policy. A pattern of mutual recrimination has emerged. The U.S. criticizes Latin America's coddling of Fidel Castro's regime and punishes countries like Colombia and Mexico for not doing enough to control drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Latin American governments criticize what they perceive as the return of U.S. "big stick" unilateralism and feel betrayed by Washington's bipartisan stampede away from NAFTA's expansion and the FTAA process.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Leading by Example.</b> If the U.S. expects Latin America and the Caribbean to cooperate on policy issues viewed as important to U.S. economic and security interests, it must assert its leadership and set the example. Abandoning trade commitments like adding Chile to NAFTA is the antithesis of leadership, and it sets a bad example. Instead of building a bridge to the 21st century that would unite the U.S. and the democracies of the Western Hemisphere, the U.S. retreat from NAFTA's expansion and the U.S. government's managed trade policies have dug a moat between Washington and the rest of the Americas.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To restore American leadership to the FTAA process and repair the recent damage to U.S. relations with Latin America and the Caribbean, the U.S. Administration should carry out the following ten initiatives:
<p><blockquote>
<b>1. Approve a new fast-track negotiating authority.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Without fast-track in hand, the Administration cannot enter into serious trade negotiations with Chile or any other country. Chile has claimed that it will not negotiate its entry into NAFTA until fast-track is renewed. Suggestions that fast-track is not necessary to enter into trade negotiations are mistaken. No country will invest the time or the human and financial resources in negotiating with the U.S. if American negotiators cannot guarantee that any agreement reached will not be mutilated beyond recognition by the U.S. Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Without fast-track, U.S. participation in and influence at the third post-Summit of the Americas Trade Ministerial during the second quarter of 1997 in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte will be marginal at best; moreover, U.S. proposals are more likely to be rejected. Symbolically, making renewal of fast-track one of the first actions of a new Administration and Congress would constitute a strong reaffirmation of America's commitment to free trade and would send Latin America a powerful message that the U.S. has re-engaged in the FTAA process. The dynamics of the Belo Horizonte trade ministerial could be altered completely if the U.S. delegation arrives with fast-track negotiating authority. Without fast-track, however, the U.S. risks being left behind again as Brazil's vision of turning Mercosur into a SAFTA stokes the enthusiasm of other Latin American governments.
<p>
<b>2. Expand NAFTA during 1997 to include Chile.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the greatest mistakes made recently by the U.S. in Latin America was postponing the inclusion of Chile in NAFTA until after the 1996 elections. The failure to add Chile to NAFTA weakened American leadership and influence in the FTAA process.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is no reason to delay the admission of Chile to NAFTA. Chile's total gross national product is equivalent to about 1 percent of the American economy. Chile has enjoyed positive economic growth for 14 consecutive years. Growth during the past six years under a democratic civilian government has averaged 7.5 percent annually. Chile has pre-paid a large chunk of its external public sector debt, has no balance-of-payments problems, and has enjoyed single-digit inflation since 1994. Its investment and savings rates are approaching those of the Asian Tigers. The inclusion of Chile in NAFTA would confirm America's commitment to leading the FTAA process, open a new gateway for U.S. exports to markets in South America and APEC, and provide America with valuable strategic leverage for future convergence talks with Mercosur.
<P>
<b>3. Include the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries in NAFTA.</b><sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 553, stalled in Congress since 1995, is intended to correct an imbalance created by NAFTA that directly affects the interests of U.S. producers, importers, retailers, and consumers. The bill was developed to assure "parity" for producers in CBI countries with the market access provided to Mexican producers under the NAFTA. Such parity is badly needed. The Bush and Clinton Administrations mistakenly assumed that NAFTA would not divert trade and investment from the CBI countries. Since the implementation of NAFTA on January 1, 1994, U.S. imports of certain products (such as apparel) produced in the CBI countries by American firms have been affected adversely. The trade advantages created by NAFTA have enhanced the attractiveness of Mexico as a site for investing in manufacturing operations for export to the U.S. As a result, the rate of growth for apparel imports from CBI countries into the U.S. fell from 25 percent during 1995 to about 8 percent for the first five months of 1996, while apparel imports from Mexico during the same five-month period grew by 41 percent.<sup>20</sup>
<p>
<b>4. Launch a dialogue to integrate NAFTA and Mercosur.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The dynamics of the FTAA process have changed. The U.S. has squandered a two-year window of opportunity to influence the timetable and pathway for creating an FTAA, and Mercosur has emerged as a viable alternative pathway to an FTAA that many Latin American countries find appealing. Therefore, NAFTA and Mercosur should engage quickly in a formal dialogue with the goal of deepening and harmonizing trade disciplines as both groups take on new members. The ultimate objective should be to merge the two regional blocs into one hemispheric FTAA by 2005.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1995, the Clinton Administration has been trying without success to establish a formal dialogue between NAFTA and Mercosur. The problem is a series of disagreements among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.<sup>21</sup>  Mexico opposes a NAFTA-Mercosur dialogue, arguing that it is not needed to achieve an FTAA by 2005 and that NAFTA should focus instead on granting real negotiating powers to the 11 technical work groups involved in the FTAA process.<sup>22</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Canada supports the U.S. proposal for a NAFTA-Mercosur dialogue but is reluctant to proceed without Mexico. The Canadians also oppose creating an FTAA as a pathway to NAFTA-Mercosur convergence by 2005. Instead, the Canadians favor replacing NAFTA and Mercosur with a new agreement negotiated simultaneously by all 34 democracies in the Western Hemisphere. Further complicating matters, enactment of the Helms-Burton Act has divided NAFTA, as Mexico and Canada are bitterly opposed to its implementation. As a result, the U.S. and Brazil announced in late August that an overdue report on the status of their ongoing bilateral trade review would be delayed. Several rounds of technical talks failed to achieve any breakthroughs on bilateral issues, such as improving the implementation of anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws in both countries. In addition, the July 1996 deadline for holding the first formal meeting between NAFTA and Mercosur was missed.
<P>
<b>5. Define a pathway and timetable for creating the FTAA.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. should urge Western Hemispheric nations to decide quickly whether the FTAA should include commitments that go beyond those already made in NAFTA and the WTO or should be abandoned in favor of merely removing tariffs on goods traded within the region.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Defining the timetable and pathway for the FTAA would advance the regional trade process in three ways: 1) It would focus the efforts of the 11 FTAA working groups set up to prepare for future negotiations; 2) it would help establish priorities for the FTAA agenda; and 3) it would help set a better stage for the difficult negotiations of the details of an FTAA agreement. The U.S., Canada, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Costa Rica at various times have supported an FTAA based on WTO-plus disciplines in which, by 2005 when the FTAA is scheduled to go into effect, all of the commitments and trading disciplines established under the WTO would be implemented. However, Brazil has forcefully opposed proposals for an FTAA that goes beyond the WTO.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A fast-track negotiating authority in hand before the third post-Summit of the Americas trade ministerial next year in Brazil would improve the prospects for faster trade liberalization based on NAFTA/WTO-plus trading disciplines. Without fast-track, U.S. hopes of accelerating and enriching the FTAA process may be stillborn at the Belo Horizonte trade ministerial in 1997.
<p>
<b>6. Implement reforms that do not require formal negotiations.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are many unilateral actions that governments in the Western Hemisphere could take without engaging in formal state-to-state negotiations. Moreover, these reforms could yield swift benefits for both the U.S. and Latin America, since they would improve market access by injecting more transparency into the government rulemaking process and by dismantling tariff and non-tariff barriers to the faster and more efficient movement of goods, services, and capital throughout the region. For example, governments could simplify and harmonize rules and regulations relating to customs practices, sanitary standards, and technical barriers to trade. They also could pledge to avoid imposing new tariff and non-tariff barriers or raising existing barriers to the flow of goods, services, and investment within the region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A third area in which governments should move quickly is revision of national investment laws to guarantee the right of establishment and national treatment of foreign investors, no restrictions on repatriation of profits and capital and access to convertible currency for all such transactions, protection against expropriation and compensation at fair market value in the event expropriation occurs, and phaseout of all performance requirements. Yet another area in which swift reforms are possible is the enactment of laws and policies that provide world-class protection for patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. Moreover, barriers to trade in services should be removed quickly, particularly in the areas of finance, telecommunications, and transportation. In addition, governments in Latin America should eliminate requirements and preferences in their purchase of goods and services, reduce market-distorting subsidies, and strengthen national competition laws.<sup>24</sup>  These reforms would accelerate the momentum of the FTAA process and yield tangible benefits in the form of faster trade growth and increased foreign direct investment flows in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
<b>7. Establish separate negotiations on issues unrelated to free trade.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both the expansion of NAFTA and U.S. leadership in the FTAA process have been undermined by the Clinton Administration's insistence on linking trade agreements to issues unrelated to free trade, such as labor standards and the environment. The Administration has threatened to impose trade sanctions against Colombia because President Ernesto Samper financed his 1994 election campaign in part with $6 million contributed by the Cali drug cartel. It also has delayed the implementation of a NAFTA obligation to allow Mexican trucks to circulate freely in the American Southwest, alleging concern about drug trafficking and U.S. national security.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
However, while hemispheric negotiations may be required to find common solutions to problems such as drug trafficking, illegal immigration, the environment, and labor standards, such pressure tactics work against U.S. interests in the region. Trade sanctions generally are not effective. Moreover, Latin American governments are unwilling to accommodate the Clinton Administration's demands for labor and environmental linkages to trade agreements; as a result, they will likely seek alternatives to NAFTA, such as Mercosur, SAFTA, the European Union, and Asian countries like Japan and Korea.
<p>
<b>8. Negotiate FTAs with New Zealand, Singapore, and Australia.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many free traders believe that the pathways followed in creating the FTAA do not matter as long as a hemispheric free trade area is up and running by 2005. However, the recent breakup of the FTAA process into smaller regional trade agreements such as NAFTA and Mercosur is not a positive development. Smaller regional trade agreements may encourage increased trade and investment among the respective members of each group, but higher external tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade with countries that are not members of these groups hinder the efficient global movement of goods, services, and capital. The U.S. should refocus on multilateral trade liberalization and use regional free trade areas such as NAFTA to spur even larger trade zones. Negotiating bilateral NAFTA/WTO-plus trade agreements with Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore could energize the FTAA process, spur faster progress in APEC, and create momentum for merging the FTAA and APEC into a single free trade area.
<p>
<b>9. Convene a second Summit of the Americas in 1997.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A second Summit of the Americas should be convened in Chile in December 1997 to put the FTAA process back on a fast track to completion by 2005. However, before the second summit is held, the U.S. should renew fast-track, Chile should be included in NAFTA, and the CBI countries should be granted trading parity with NAFTA members. At this summit, the leaders of the hemisphere's democracies should agree on three things: 1) a specific pathway and timetable for achieving an FTAA; 2) creation of an institutional entity similar to the WTO to coordinate the FTAA negotiations; and 3) empowering the 11 technical working groups to negotiate firm FTAA proposals related to their respective areas of responsibility. In addition, APEC countries should be invited to participate as observers.
<p>
<b>10. Dismantle domestic U.S. barriers to free trade.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The greatest impediments to free trade and creation of the FTAA are found in Washington. For decades, the federal government has operated a vast and complex protectionist machine that has cost American taxpayers and consumers hundreds of billions of dollars. This protectionism comes in many forms, including traditional tariffs, quotas, "voluntary" restraint agreements, orderly marketing agreements, antidumping duties, countervailing duties, tax regulations, technology controls, anti-trust laws, and many other anti-trade weapons used against foreign exporters seeking greater access to the U.S. market as well as American firms and investors trying to compete globally.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Instead of protecting American consumers, preserving jobs, strengthening American manufacturing, encouraging new technology development, and improving American competitiveness in the global economy, this protectionism weakens U.S. companies in the international marketplace, promotes investment in noncompetitive sectors, enshrines low-skilled workers, and hinders productivity growth. American consumers pay a high price for these misguided policies. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank has estimated that import-protection schemes amount to the equivalent of a 23 percent income tax surcharge for low-income American families, or 10 percent for the average family. The Federal Trade Commission has determined that it costs the U.S. economy nearly $90 for each dollar saved by protected American firms. Overall, congressionally mandated protection and managed trade policies cost American consumers at least $70 billion a year and encourage America's trading partners to retaliate in kind, especially in the areas of anti-dumping and countervailing duty legislation.<sup>25</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1993, the Clinton Administration has preached the gospel of free trade in international forums such as the WTO, APEC, and the FTAA. In practice, however, the Administration's "strategic trade policies" have laid the foundations for even greater U.S. government protectionism and interference in the economy. For example, the Administration's National Export Strategy<sup>26</sup> and Big Emerging Markets (BEMs) Initiative<sup>27</sup> outline the twin pillars of an industrial policy and an expanded federal government role in the international marketplace. The basic premise of these strategies is that "U.S. firms will need the U.S. government at their side to win a fair hearing" in the global marketplace.<sup>28</sup>  According to President Clinton, the BEMs Initiative "streamlines Administration resources to focus on the markets in which government involvement can truly make a difference for America's businesses and workers."<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where trade policy is concerned, the Clinton Administration is making big government even bigger. The Administration has targeted domestic "clusters" of high-technology industries for export to key foreign markets where the U.S. government can help American firms secure market access, obtain financing, and win contracts for major projects in which foreign governments help competing bidders or play an important decisionmaking role in awarding projects.<sup>30</sup>  In addition, the Administration has established new divisions at the International Trade Administration and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to monitor and enforce foreign compliance with U.S. trade laws and agreements.<sup>31</sup>  The Administration also wants other trading nations to adopt a core set of labor principles as part of any future trade liberalization, and continues to insist that any new fast-track negotiating authority must contain strong negotiation provisions on both labor and the environment even though Latin American governments have strenuously opposed such linkages.

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. has lost its once-respected leadership role in Latin America. The Clinton Administration turned its back on Latin America when the Mexican peso tumbled in December 1994. The expansion of NAFTA has stalled, and the U.S. no longer leads the FTAA process. Although Latin America has recovered from the aftershocks of the peso crisis and trade expansion continues unabated throughout the Western Hemisphere, the Clinton Administration and many in Congress are reluctant to put the expansion of NAFTA back on a fast track. Instead, they are behaving as though the American economy ends at the Atlantic and Pacific continental shelves, with nothing beyond the continent but an economic void that threatens America.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
From 1980-1992, the Reagan and Bush Administrations forged the closest friendship with Latin America that the U.S. has ever enjoyed. However, it took the Clinton Administration less than three years to dissolve that exciting new relationship in acrimonious recriminations and unkept American promises. If the Administration does not halt its flight from free trade and the expansion of NAFTA, U.S. economic and security interests in the Americas could suffer a sustained decline.

When Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn addressed the graduates of Harvard on the eighth of June, 1978, they gathered in anticipation of an extraordinary event.  But in his remarks, which he called <I>A World Split Apart</I>, Solzhenitsyn eschewed the kind of fulsome compliments now endemic in commencement speeches.  Instead, taking advantage of the fact that Harvard's motto is "Veritas," he ventured to tell them the truth:  that "a decline in courage may be the most striking feature that an outside observer notices in the West today."  Speaking barely three years after the fall of Saigon, he observed in Americans something approaching "a lack of manhood" in acquiescing in communist aggression, a trend he found most pronounced "among the ruling and intellectual elites."
<p>
Solzhenitsyn's speech, which might have been an opening wedge into closed minds, only made some Americans stamp their feet in irritation.  It was much easier to conclude that he was wrong than to admit that we had abandoned Vietnam because of our own cowardice.  So his speech provoked a firestorm of condemnation in the media, led by First Lady Rosalynn Carter, who claimed that the Russian writer had no understanding of the United States.
<p>
Though Solzhenitsyn, who had braved the death camps of the Gulag Archipelago and the interrogations of the Soviet secret police in his quest for the truth, hardly needed to burnish his character as a brave man by speaking the truth in Harvard Yard, the speech did prove to be the turning point in his public reputation in this country.  Because of his many unfashionable conclusions, the mainstream media decided that he was a crank, so the man who had been lionized in American literary circles was thenceforth shut out, dismissed, and ignored.  A host of ignorant charges were made against him, while his message to Americans was buried and forgotten.  Harper and Row, which published the address in a little book with the Russian text on one side and the English translation on the other, allowed it to go out of print by the late 1980s.
<p>
The antipathy of the media toward Solzhenitsyn was long-lasting and still has not let up.  When he returned to Russia in 1994, they hastened to conclude that he was just as irrelevant in his own country as they had deemed him to be in ours.  As <I>A World Split Apart</I> makes clear in its lucid discussion of the media in Western countries, they are not open to unfashionable arguments.  Their reaction to the speech was predictable, and in effect Solzhenitsyn's speech predicts it, at least in broad outline.  Thus, the speech was more than a reproach, from a friendly but frank observer, of America's loss of courage:  It was a demonstration of courage by the Russian writer, whose speech was also a deed.
<p>
Solzhenitsyn's example of courage in the speech had a practical effect.  The complacency of the media was not the only opinion abroad in the land.  Among American students of foreign affairs, and also the general public, there was a widespread and justified apprehension by the late 1970s that our loss of courage had left the United States at risk.  The war in Afghanistan, pursued in sharp contrast with the former caution of the Soviet Union, was one sign of danger; another was the impudent seizure of American hostages by the Iranian revolutionaries.  The 1980 presidential election, which turned on the difference between these two opinions about America's place in the world, marked an important turn in our politics.
<p>
In the decade after Solzhenitsyn spoke, American courage played a vital part in the collapse of the Soviet Union -- the most astonishing political event in the lifetime of my generation.  The stiffening of American resolve after the humiliations of the 1970s had many manifestations, but it was personified in the presidency of Ronald Reagan, whom Solzhenitsyn publicly praised.  From the beginning of his administration, Reagan showed courage unknown to his predecessor.  His prompt decision to fire air traffic controllers engaged in an illegal strike caused Americans and foreigners alike to take notice.  Even more important was the way he acted when he was shot in the spring of 1981:  We saw courage in his jokes, and nothing made him more formidable.  His subsequent willingness to call the Soviet Union an "evil empire" instead of falling back on the usual diplomatic euphemisms, and his evident resolve to prevent that country from achieving worldwide hegemony, made a deep impression on his countrymen, on their allies, and also on the Soviets.
<p>
By the time Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia, of course, the "world split apart" that he had described in his speech had been transformed by the American victory in the Cold War, which culminated in the fall of the Soviet Union.  The tense bipolar world of two superpowers, each representing a different moral and political understanding of man, had been replaced by the uneasy -- and sometimes unacknowledged -- triumph of liberal democracy.  Russia returned to the sort of remedial aspiration for democracy that held sway before its government was hijacked by communists during the Great War, while the United States greeted its own dominance with the sort of absentminded modesty that comes over it when it is not at war.
<p>
The sudden demise of the Soviet Union, like the fall of Saigon, was only the culmination of a long series of events, many of them little noticed or understood at the time.  The Soviet Union fell after its rulers realized that communism, which always left the Russian empire at a moral and economic disadvantage, could not keep up with technological progress in the free nations of the world.  That realization, which became widespread among well-placed Russians in the 1980s, made them lose heart about continuing their long-standing war of nerves with the United States.
<p>
It is not given to human beings to know the future, so we cannot be sure that the changes in the Soviet Union are irreversible, dramatic as their effects already have been in many parts of the world.  Powerful politicians who cleave to communism and prefer the old regime now control important offices in Russia and are bidding for the presidency.  The picture also is mixed in many of the former Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe.  Cuba and North Korea remain unbending, though increasingly isolated in their backwardness.  China and Vietnam have begun to modernize their economies by taking some small steps toward a free market, but without dismantling communist tyranny.  In China's case, the transition has been accompanied by an unwelcome belligerency toward the interests and friends of the United States.  Therefore, the post-Cold War world calls for continuing resolve and prudence on our part, not relaxation or inattention.
<p>
But there is plenty of evidence in <I>A World Split Apart</I> -- and much more in Solzhenitsyn's other writings on human nature and politics -- that the Russian writer considers courage important not only as an aid to preserving a decent regime, which it has been for the United States, but also as a virtue that belongs to a properly ordered human soul.  Thus, courage is prized for its own sake as well as for its instrumental effects.  When Solzhenitsyn reproached us for losing heart, he meant to make us ashamed, not just afraid.
<p>
What is courage?  Ernest Hemingway described it as "grace under pressure."  John Milton wrote that a man who had it would "never...  submit or yield."  Solzhenitsyn's predecessor as an honorary American citizen, Winston Churchill, esteemed it "the first of human qualities" -- in fact, the one that guarantees all the others.  In his youth, he sought to win a reputation for courage.  He tells us in his autobiography <I>My Early Life</I> how, after he left the military academy at Sandhurst, he carried out a private experiment by attaching himself to a Spanish column fighting a guerrilla war in Cuba.  Before he got too far into his career as a cavalry officer, he wanted to find out if he had courage enough.  On his 21st birthday, he came under fire for the first time and was relieved to discover that not everyone gets killed, or even hurt.  The young Churchill escaped unscathed, thanks to a well-fed Spanish officer who was asleep in a hammock between him and the enemy guns.  He did not begrudge the fat man his meals.  Keeping the example of his unofficial trial of courage in Cuba in mind, we can discern a few capital facts about it.
<p>
Courage has to do with braving dangers nobly.  It means surmounting the fear of wounds or death.  In his autobiography, Churchill tells us how he gave up a piece of skin from his forearm to seal the wound of a brother officer.  A brave man can endure the prospect of bodily pain or violent death, or even the reality of it, without flinching.  But the danger that he knows how to face has to have something of nobility in it:  Courage is shown in surmounting your fear of being hurt or killed not through illness or a car accident, but through war.  Therefore, courage is seen more in Churchill's being under fire than in his willingness to be flayed by the doctor to help his wounded friend, though as a brave man he faced both kinds of pains well.  This endurance, which is really just doggedness, is an important part of courage and distinguishes someone who has the virtue from someone who does not have it.
<p>
It was Aristotle who invented the distinction between intellectual virtue and moral or ethical virtue, arguing that courage was one of the moral virtues, along with moderation, magnanimity, justice, veracity, and others.  He showed us that, like other moral virtues, courage is a habit, not an opinion or a frame of mind.  It is not enough simply to praise courage, or even to understand it.  To develop a habit like courage, you need chances to practice it.  Hence Churchill's eagerness to put himself in harm's way:  You can't act courageously without having dangers to face, and you can't cultivate a habit of courage without acting courageously.
<p>
Aristotle argued that, again like other moral virtues, courage is found in a mean, in between an excess and a defect.  The courageous man is not too afraid of dangers, like a coward, nor is he too unafraid of them, like a rash man.  Of the two extremes, the ordinary human bent is toward cowardice, because people have a natural disinclination to suffer pain or death -- a disinclination that is perfectly reasonable.  But rashness is a vice as well, because the rash man lacks the steadiness and the prudence of the courageous man.  Churchill acted rashly when he jumped off a bridge just after his 18th birthday to avoid being captured by his brother and a cousin, who were chasing him.  He fell 29 feet to the ground, ruptured his kidney among other organs, and for a year afterward "looked at life round a corner."  But rashness can be turned toward courage by age and experience more easily than cowardice can.
<p>
If wanting to avoid pain or death is perfectly reasonable, then courage, which puts you in harm's way, seems to have something in common with stupidity.  Churchill admits as much when he says of his trip to Cuba, "You might call it tomfoolery.  To travel thousands of miles with money one can ill afford, and get up at four o'clock in the morning in the hope of getting into a scrape in the company of perfect strangers, is hardly a rational proceeding."  Being virtuous is supposed to be pleasant, yet courage requires you to stand your ground tenaciously even when the consequence may be pain or death.  A brave man will sometimes charge into the enemy line, but a horse never will.  A horse is smart enough to shy away, and men often shy away too.  Hence Hobbes's notorious description of a battle as a running away on one side -- or both.
<p>
Nonetheless, Churchill knew "there were very few subalterns in the British Army who would not have given a month's pay" to share his adventure.  A courageous man does not just run away from battle.  He is willing to risk danger because, for him, avoiding pain and staying alive are not the most important things.  Everyone prefers to stay alive, of course; but the courageous man gives even his own life the proper weight:  not too little and not too much.  He isn't willing to pay any price just to stay alive, because he isn't willing to live just any kind of life.  He knows that everyone dies in the end, so what matters is the kind of life you live.  The price you pay to stay alive is too high if it means your life is not fully human; and a life of comfortable self-preservation is not a fully human life, because it lacks risk and adventure.  In addition to the endurance or tenacity -- the doggedness -- that I mentioned earlier, courage involves daring.  The courageous man dares, and dares greatly, like Churchill, who as a young man took risks over and over again to get to the battlefield, and then took risks on the battlefield to win a name for valor.
<p>
Here is a clue as to why he ranked courage first among the virtues.  For human beings, living means taking risks, because we are neither omniscient or omnipotent.  If we knew everything that was going to happen to us ahead of time, we could foresee and forestall injury and perhaps even death, but then life would be dull and not worth living.  Or, if we had the power to master everything, we could overcome even dangers that we could not foresee, which again would give us the conceit of absolute assurance and a very humdrum life.  Churchill explores these possibilities in his essay "A Second Choice," published in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>.
<p>
This idea of becoming omniscient or omnipotent is the real aspiration of modern science -- mastering nature, overcoming chance, learning to control our surroundings, taking the risk out of life by making it entirely predictable.  For Churchill, this aspiration is misbegotten, as he suggests in some of the other essays in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>.  Insofar as science succeeds in mastering nature -- and Churchill is impressed with the success of modern technology -- it adds to our power, but without making us better or happier.  As fast as we embrace the fruits of modern science, we find that the guarantee of a good life is still somewhere around the next corner.  And when men reach the limits of their ability to control the world -- for Churchill concludes that there are limits to our science and power, particularly when it comes to reshaping human nature -- then they may realize ruefully that what nature gives us is not so bad after all, compared to what we make for ourselves.  Indeed, that realization may prove a relief.
<p>
We do not have the kind of comprehensive knowledge that would allow us to avoid every wrong turn, but we can have a human wisdom that allows us to see a little way ahead, if we are prudent.  And we do not have the kind of absolute power that would allow us to overcome every obstacle and accomplish every wish, but we do have the human strength to make a better life for ourselves, if we act wisely.  Discernment is needed to guide our actions; that is the intellectual side.  But courage is the moral equipment we need to live in an uncertain world without letting ourselves be either reduced to malleable material directed from without (a cowardly surrender of our humanity) or seduced by the idea that human beings can control everything (a rash attempt to play God).
<p>
Modern science leads men into both mistakes by considering us at once as material beings undifferentiated from the rest of nature and as rational beings radically distinct from the rest of nature.  A more suitable and courageous posture is suggested by Aristotle, who found no mean part for men with the moral virtues (and no one who has read Aristotle will fault me for any originality in my treatment of courage, unless I have made any mistakes).  Winston Churchill's discoveries about courage are remarkably similar to Aristotle's treatment of that virtue in the <I>Nicomachean Ethics</I>.  Churchill was aware of this similarity, but he did not consider it a coincidence.  When someone recommended Aristotle's book to him and then asked Churchill what he thought after he had read it, the answer he got was that Aristotle's views on ethics were very sensible, but not very different from those that Churchill had formed on his own.
<p>
Courage is always a popular virtue, but especially in wartime, when it seems so obviously needed.  A coward is no use to others in case of danger, whereas everyone hopes to find a brave man fighting shoulder to shoulder at his side.  But courage is not useful only on the battlefield:  It also is a good sign that a person is worth befriending.  One who prizes his own comfort and life above everything else is too selfish to be a friend to anyone else.  Churchill mentions that, in his youth, men who had been in battle had an aura about them that was recognized by the girls they courted.  In this, the girls showed a nice understanding of what was good for them, since a coward is too selfish to give much consideration to anyone else -- even his own wife or family.
<p>
But a courageous man is not courageous simply because he seeks the esteem of others.  While that aspiration is a healthy spur to a young man learning to be courageous, it cannot be the motive of a man who has courage.  A courageous man does not sacrifice his own pleasure as he does courageous deeds, though he may sacrifice his own comfort; he takes pleasure in acting courageously, even if he has to endure pain.  The pain, or the risk of death, is a reminder that human beings are not all souls, that we live in bodies and are vulnerable through them.  It is also the reason that courage, as the first of the virtues, is on a lower level than others, like friendliness and wittiness, that do not require us to suffer pain.
<p>
Aristotle reserves courage, and the rest of the virtues as well, for gentlemen who have been properly raised.  But Churchill, though he does not turn up his nose at gentlemanliness, seems to encourage young men of spirit wherever he finds them.  He calls his autobiography <I>My Early Life</I> "a tale of youthful endeavour," dedicates it "to a new generation," and in it exhorts young men "all over the world" to take their places "in life's fighting line."  He tells them that they should never "take No for an answer" and "Never submit to failure."
<p>
Churchill's autobiography, which is still in print, is an adventure story that rivals for color, incident, and vivid description the best stories of Mark Twain, whom he admired.  Churchill would approve of the study of his own life as a spur to ambition, a guide to political judgment, and a model of courage, just as he studied and learned from the examples of his father Lord Randolph Churchill and his great forebear John Churchill, the first duke of Marlborough.
<p>
But Churchill is not the only one who can teach us courage.  Solzhenitsyn's books hold lessons for us too, especially his most impressive book, the three-volume <I>Gulag Archipelago</I>, which opens a whole new moral universe to the unsuspecting Western reader.  Beginning with <I>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</I>, the only one of his books that was published in communist Russia, Solzhenitsyn explored the question of what gives a human being strength to live a virtuous life under the most unpromising conditions.  <I>The Gulag Archipelago</I> affords a lengthier description of the men who discovered their souls under the bleak and distant sun of the Soviet death camps.  One of the merits of Solzhenitsyn's account is to show how that courage cannot quite stand alone as a moral virtue, that it needs to be paired with prudence.  Aristotle had come to the same conclusion.
<p>
And if we are looking for American heroes, some of the same discoveries may be made from reading the memoir written by our highest-ranking Vietnam POW, Admiral Jim Stockdale, and the woman who staunchly waited and worked for his return, Sybil Stockdale.  Stockdale is a man of remarkable thoughtfulness, a careful student of philosophers like Plato and Epictetus.  He had plenty of time to think as he endured privation and torture in the Hanoi Hilton.  The book he wrote with his wife, <I>In Love and War</I>, tells the story of his captivity from both sides.  Both endurance and daring, and the way these two elements of courage have to be guided by practical wisdom, can be learned from the Stockdales' book.
<p>
At first blush, Solzhenitsyn's warning that Americans might lack courage to prevail over the Soviets now seems too pessimistic.  The United States is the only remaining superpower:  The Soviet Union lies in the dust.  American steadiness won the Cold War, though my generation has never experienced a hot war worldwide.  Still, we have only to go back to the Gulf War to remember how the United States formed ranks against a nasty aggressor.  Though few Americans were called on to make sacrifices in that war, our experience in Korea, or in the two world wars, suggests our countrymen will not shrink from fighting to defend liberty.  In retrospect, Vietnam looks like an exception -- not that our soldiers, sailors, and airmen were loath to put themselves in harm's way, or the American people (with some sorry exceptions) to support them; but our political leaders lacked steady resolve to guide them and to explain the war to their fellow citizens.
<p>
Up to this point, I have emphasized courage in battle or in other situations of mortal danger.  That is a necessary corrective to the penchant today to prefer so-called moral courage, or the courage of your convictions, to real courage.  People who have the courage of their convictions, which means sincerity and a certain determination, have the strength of soul required for all the virtues, but not necessarily the particular moral habit of courage.  Voltaire is famous for saying that though he might disagree with what you said, he would defend to his death your right to say it.  For this sort of remark, he is widely praised for having moral courage.  But as Harvey Mansfield points out, that is not courage at all, but only cheap talk.  Voltaire never defended to the death anyone's right to say anything, much less something with which he disagreed; and it is doubtful that anyone ever has.
<p>
Since the decision to end the draft for American citizens, most of our young people have no experience of military service or the possibility of risking their lives for their country.  This deprives them of the usual way of learning about courage in practice.  But I do not mean to suggest that if you have no chance to go into battle, you cannot have courage.  That virtue belongs not only on the battlefield, but also in the peaceable lives of citizens and statesmen.  There is reason to be apprehensive about the courage of Americans today, from the man in the street right up to the White House.  Students are more likely to know about George Washington's false teeth than his courage as a general and statesman, and shoppers do not even remember whose birthday "Presidents' Day" once celebrated.  Public schools aim to make students fit in or to give them a specious self-esteem rather than teach them examples of the virtues, and courage is one of the most neglected.
<p>
Stigmatized as aggressive behavior by people who are hostile to anything noble, courage is treated with suspicion if it ever comes up; but mostly, the politically correct curriculum simply avoids mentioning it.  The kind of challenging, competitive, or warlike occasions that call forth courage are neither studied nor experienced in the classroom.  By giving up any effort to instruct students in moral virtues like courage, public schools discourage them.  The student who has faced exacting expectations from a teacher is a rare bird, easily recognizable by the unusual demands of his self-respect; but mostly, little is asked and little is learned.  Unambitious, unaccomplished, unenterprising students make half-hearted scholars, but they also are ill-prepared for life and make an easy mark for the engrossing distractions of alcohol, drugs, and television stupor.
<p>
Yet when you neglect the spirited part of students' souls, they do not just atrophy.  High aspirations remain, and students learn courage, if they do, in their increasingly risky unofficial dealings with each other and the world.  Too many of them are punished for their courage if they stand up to gang violence; others learn to act courageously in the bosom of a gang on behalf of a bad cause.  Public schools and the media maintain a conspiratorial silence about the prevalence of gang violence.  Parents do not want to believe it and too often are oblivious to the problem, but students know all about it.
<p>
Students today seem starved for good examples, for some relief from the public school professionalism that chills their ardent curiosity about the right way to live and denies them the kind of rousing adventures that appealed to young Winston Churchill.  Teachers who love their subjects and hold students to high standards, academic contests with winners and losers, conversations in class that give students a chance to explore their own questions with the help of classic writings -- these traditional methods could bring some excitement back into the classroom.  Students would be as encouraged to see dumbed-down, mealy-mouthed textbooks replaced with real books as to see dumbed-down, mealy-mouthed facilitators replaced with real teachers.
<p>
The long-run effects of neglecting courage go beyond our schools to civil society, where a parallel professionalism makes courts ineffective at maintaining civil order.  In our political leaders, lack of courage manifests itself, as Churchill observed, in living "in the temperamental atmosphere of a Gallup Poll -- always feeling one's pulse and taking one's temperature."  The politics of meeting the demands of your constituents, of pleasing an often uninstructed public, of changing your stance to get re-elected -- in short, what you might call the politics of valetudinarianism -- is rampant today (not that cautious compromise is always wrong, or a shift in position always the sign of a craven politician).
<p>
But Churchill warns that that sort of politician is increasingly common in our democratic age.  As usual, he reflects on this subject in his writings.  As he writes in "Fifty Years Hence," an essay published in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>, "Democratic governments drift along the line of least resistance, taking short views, paying their way with sops and doles and smoothing their path with pleasant-sounding platitudes."  That's a good description of presidential politics today.  Few of our politicians understand Churchill's remark that "politics is almost as exciting as war and quite as dangerous" because "in war you can only be killed once, but in politics many times."  Most of them are too timid to risk being killed politically even once.
<p>
In his essay on "Consistency in Politics" in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>, Churchill explores his view of political courage.  He deprecates the small-souled kind of consistency that means unbending adherence to a certain position, no matter what the circumstances; circumstances change, so positions have to change too.  A larger consistency means that a man has "the same dominating purpose," as he writes, even if circumstances force him to throw his weight now on one side, now on the other of a durable political controversy.  For instance, it is impossible to say in principle whether defense spending should be higher or lower; it is only possible to make a practical judgment about what the current situation requires, which may change from one year to the next.
<p>
But, as his countrymen would discover in the 1930s when he began his brave but lonely campaign to warn them of the Nazi menace, Churchill had no time for the kind of politician who simply swims with the current.  Such a timid policy neglects a statesman's responsibility as custodian of his nation's abiding interests.  Representative government requires a certain courage in its statesmen:  the courage to show constituents their true interests instead of just reflecting their wishes.  Americans citizens need that kind of instruction as much as their political leaders need the political courage and discernment to offer it.
<p>
When Solzhenitsyn explored the reason for resistance to Soviet tyranny in the third volume of <I>The Gulag Archipelago</I>, he found it in the courage of some human beings who had, as he said, "a nobler conception of life."  Courage is the virtue that defends our liberty; it is also the first virtue of a man who is truly free.  Therefore, it belongs, in the company of the other moral virtues, with what Russell Kirk finely described as "the permanent things."

<h3>Eve Without Adam: What Genesis Has to Tell America About Natural Law</h3>
By David F. Forte<br>
Professor of Law, Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, Cleveland State University
<p>
Heritage Lecture No. 570<br>
A <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">Russell Kirk Memorial Lecture</a><br>
Delivered May 1, 1996<br>
<p>

In the spring of 1992, I was ensconced here on the fifth floor of the Heritage Foundation. There I was, ferreting out the historical basis of the Supreme Court's right to strike down legislation, when, from a few blocks away, the Justices graced my work with the following statement:
	<p>
<blockquote>At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. (<I>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</I>, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 2807 [1992].)
</blockquote>
<p>
All that was mine?  I thought. You mean, I -- on the fifth floor of the Heritage Foundation -- could define "existence," "the mystery of human life," and the "universe" too?  Yes, said the Court. All I need do, the Justices said, was accept the right of the Court to "speak before all others" on constitutional ideals and to follow its lead no matter what qualms of conscience I might have. The Court made that statement, of course, to support the right of a woman to terminate the life of the developing human fetus within her. But somehow, the Court's declaration had a more ancient ring to it.
<p>
Normally when I speak at the Heritage Foundation, I talk about law. But I am not going to talk about law today, even though the Supreme Court has inspired this reflection. Instead, I want to talk to you about a cultural moment, a moment Russell Kirk worked for and, I am sure, prayed for all his life. We are at a time when faith and reason, which moderns regard as antagonists, are resuming a partnership long overdue. Faith and reason are, in fact, two pillars of Western civilization, and their reintegration comes at a time when the hallmarks of that civilization are disintegrating around us.
<p>
I need not chronicle the statistics of our decline. You are familiar enough with them. <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>, Gary Bauer, Marvin Olasky, and so many others have described a society where each person has become disconnected with his fellows, where we create zones of privacy to find ourselves and lose everyone else in the bargain. We are a citizenry where to a large extent, metaphorically speaking, Eve exists without Adam, Adam without Eve, where neither truth nor permanence are seen as real and relationships of all sorts are fitful, episodic, and transient.
<P>
This may be an America where there are a thousand points of light, but each one illuminates only itself. Faith is an outlaw in the public square, and philosophy deconstructs reason itself.
<p>
It was not always this way. It certainly was not this way at the founding of the country. For, as the Founders knew so well, Western civilization was built upon both reason and faith: the faith of the Judeo-Christian revelation and the reason that discovered and applied the natural law.
<p>
Today, I wish to make but three points. First, I want to discuss something of the history of the alliance between faith and reason in Western intellectual history and their estrangement. Second, by referring to some of the elements in the Book of Genesis, I would like to affirm the basic compatibility between the principles of the natural law and the values of our religious heritage. Finally, I raise a caution regarding religious doctrine and liberty that any effective and principled alliance between faith and reason must deal with.
<p>
<b>Faith and Reason</b>
<p>
	The Greeks, who gave us so much, gave us the natural law school of thought, particularly in the writings of Aristotle. Natural law was subsequently universalized by the Stoics, incorporated into the law by the Romans, allied with Christianity, and finally raised to its highest exposition by St. Thomas Aquinas in his Scholastic philosophy. The school of natural law championed man's reason, his being, his capacity for sociability, and his virtue. The values espoused by that school dominated Western thought through the end of the 18th century and were included in the principles of the American Founding.
<p>
The Judeo-Christian revelation provided the other, complementary notion of the nature of man: created by God, fallen, covenanted, and graced with a divinely inspired mission.
<P>
In the high Middle Ages, the traditions of faith and reason reached their greatest level of integration in the natural law philosophy of Thomas Aquinas. Scholasticism constituted the most fully developed version of natural law, while of the faith of the Church unified Europe. Then came the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, and the age of scientific inquiry. The link between faith and reason was weakened, and eventually broken. The age of Reformation and Rationalism was launched. Faith sought to undo the shackles of reason, while reason tried to free itself of the shackles of religion.
<P>
Important Protestant theologians found the good solely through the will of God as revealed in His Word, while rationalists forsook natural law thinking as being too close to religion. The Reformation disparaged the Scholasticism of the high Middle Ages. God's law was divine positive law, and no natural law could independently find the good.
<p>
Not that natural law was extinguished at the end of the high Middle Ages. On the contrary, the cultural force that the alliance of faith and reason had created lasted for centuries. Even though Protestant theology rejected Scholasticism, Biblical values paralleled the norms of natural law. Magnanimity was charity, courage was fortitude, fidelity was faithfulness, community was congregation. On the other hand, although few philosophers "did" natural law from the 14th century on, most traded on its fundamental norms. Sir Edward Coke found natural justice to be "right reason," which was the basis of the common law. John Locke presumed those norms to be in the law of nature, which both limited and gave legitimacy to individual liberty. When international politics degenerated into self-interested discord, Grotius, Pufendorf, and Vattel sought to revive a modified natural law to restore some moral order to the relations between states.
<P>
The Founders fully understood that a civil society could not be maintained without recourse to the intellectual values of the natural law and the parallel spiritual values of revelation. Washington knew how crucial that bond was. As he said in his farewell address:
<P><blockquote>
	Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, Religion and Morality are indispensable supports.... In Vain would man claim the tribute of Patriotism, who should labour to avert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of Men and Citizens. The mere Politician, equally with the pious man ought to respect and to cherish them.... And let us with caution indulge the supposition, that morality can be maintained without religion.
</blockquote><p>
By the 19th century, however, the connection between the mind and the spirit was finally severed. When religion and revelation could no longer restrain reason and positivism, the power of the state and the power of the unconstrained individual came to the fore. It is not much of an exaggeration that the problems of politics since the 19th century in the world lie in the contest between the supposedly self-sufficient power of the state on the one hand and the supposedly self-sufficient power of the individual on the other. The higher law that tames both is absent.
<p>
In the 19th century, natural law had retreated to being a Catholic intellectual discipline. It was disdained in the academy. A character in Stendahl declares, "There's no such thing as natural law. This expression is nothing but old nonsense."  A lot of "old nonsense" was done away with in Fichte, Hegel, and Marx, in Austin, Bentham, and Holmes.
<p>
It was not until the aftermath of World War II, in confronting the Holocaust, that natural law stirred again in the conscience of the philosopher and the judge. If the Holocaust was evil, pure and simple, then there must be a good, pure and simple. If we shrink from thinking that the Final Solution can ever have been a valid human law because its purpose was so utterly perverse, there must be a purposive standard by which we can know what laws are indeed legitimate or not.
<P>
And so the revival began, kindling in different places: Jacques Maritain in France, Russell Kirk in the United States, the Hart/Fuller debate. By the 1980s, natural law had once again become an independent philosophical discipline. Dozens of books and hundreds of articles poured out. Natural law as a vibrant school of philosophy has returned. It is something we have not seen for six centuries.
<p>
Today, in the face of the dissolution wrought by positivism, there is a renewed alliance between faith and reason. Natural law thought is flourishing, pursued by Catholics, Jews, and Protestants, while a reawakening to faith stirs throughout the country. Pope John Paul II calls a return to natural law values essential to saving Western civilization itself, while Protestant ministers and political activists from the late Martin Luther King, Jr., to Ralph Reed find in the natural law those essential human values that are confirmed by revelation. The "law written on men's hearts," as St. Paul puts it, is once again recognized by Protestant Christianity.

<p>
<b>Genesis and the Natural Law</b>
<p>
The renewed alliance between faith and reason makes eminent sense, for the fundamental view of nature and of humanity articulated in the natural law school parallels the divine definition of creation and man taught by revelation. The example I use today is Genesis, though there are myriad other instances. I do not do so as a Biblical exegete. I am not qualified for that. But I do know something about the natural law and find that its insights are confirmed in many parts of the saga of creation in the Book of Genesis, at least according to many common interpretations of that text.
<p>
Every culture's creation stories reveal its basic concept of what is human, what is nature, and what is divine. In Genesis, we have a compilation of creation stories. Taken together, they tell us in mythic language what reason has brought us to apprehend in natural law. In its own terms, Genesis tells us what natural law tells us. It speaks to us of natural man and created man, of conjoined man and disunited man. It affirms man's reason, his goodness, his unity, and his ego. 	 Let me discuss just three parts of Genesis in relation to the natural law: the creation of the material world, the creation of man, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
<p>
Now, I am not going to talk about the creationism, or sin, or sex. If you want to talk about evolution, let's discuss it over coffee. If you want to talk about sin, perhaps we can do that over a beer. If you want to talk about sex, sorry, I'm a married man.
<p>
Let us start with the account of creation in the first chapter:
<p><blockquote>
	In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless waste, and darkness covered the abyss, and the mighty wind [the spirit of God] swept over the waters. (Genesis 1:1-2.)
</blockquote><p>
In that one majestic verse, God's creation astonishes us in two simultaneous ways. First, He creates everything ("the heavens and the earth") out of nothing. Second, He brings order out of chaos. In the image of the ancient Hebrews, the stuff of the cosmos was water, and water symbolized chaos -- which God orders. Think for a moment of the difference between farmers and fishermen: A farmer subdues the land and makes it his servant, but an experienced fisherman knows he is always a stranger on the sea and is never home till he reaches shore.
<p>
In Genesis, God's mighty spirit moves across the water, pushing it where He wills. He orders chaos itself. Recall in the New Testament, when Jesus awakens in the boat to still the storm that was threatening to overwhelm the disciples. "Who can this be," they ask in awe, "that the wind and the sea obey him?"  (Mark 4:41.) The disciples understood that this was no ordinary wonder-worker. In Genesis, God pushes the water out of the world by creating a domed firmament and separates the remaining water in the world into seas while permitting some of the remaining cosmic waters to sluice in as rain through holes in the dome, or bubble up from below through springs (oases perhaps) or rivers.
<p>
The point of creation is that without order, there would not be nothingness, but utter chaos. Let us reflect on that. People will give up their lives for order. They will die for their country, their faith, their family, or their friends. But a life without meaning leads to despair. Chaos, not death, holds the real terror for man. In the most primeval sense, a terrorist does the devil's work.
<p>
Notice also in this first chapter, that as soon as God controls chaos, pushing a mighty wind over the seas, He creates light. (Genesis 1:3.) Light is the greatest of the elements. Light is good. It illuminates the order he is creating. It is understanding. Throughout scripture, the notion of light is always seen as illuminating an understanding of the inner reality of things.
<p>
Finally, God proceeds, in a measured and deliberative manner, to create the remainder of material reality. Even with their pre-scientific notions, the Hebrews understood that everything created was logically and organically interrelated, and that reality was created in a purposeful manner from the most basic to the more refined. There is a purpose and a point to creation. It leads to man. And in finishing the work of creation, God said that it was good. (Genesis 1:31.)
<p>
In this most fundamental description of reality, natural law concurs. In natural law, reality is objective and ordered, and man is organically part of it. Socrates taught that man's reason could apprehend and illuminate this reality. He spent his life battling the Sophists, who saw only chaos underlying everything. Plato sought to discover the good that was the ultimate reality. Aristotle found that the world was the result not of chance, but of intelligent intention. He taught that change was not chaotic, but purposeful, wherein each thing moves to fulfill its own nature, and that being -- existence itself -- was in its very nature, good. All these elements were synthesized in Aquinas.
<P>
Similar parallels are in the account of man.
<p>
In the first chapter of Genesis, God creates man and woman equally in his image; that is, unlike the animals, men and women are to reflect the divine. In the second story of creation, God creates man (adam = universal humanity) and finds that "it is not good for man to be alone, I will make a suitable partner for him."  (Genesis 2:18.) God's creation is incomplete. It is not yet "good."  In natural law, too, things are good only when their nature is fulfilled, when their potentialities are brought to completion.
<p>
In Genesis, for man (that is, mankind in its individualization) to be complete, he needs a helpmeet. Likewise, in the natural law tradition, Aristotle insists that man cannot truly flourish as a human unless he is associated together in the polity. From Aristotle on, the natural law tradition emphasizes the fundamental good of friendship, defined as seeking the good of the other. In Genesis, there is a special complementarity in the friendship of a man and a woman, which becomes the fundamental experience of the good of sociability of each individual.
<p>
In natural law, sociability (which I think is natural law's unique contribution to understanding contemporary problems) is something without which man cannot flourish as a human person. It has its most intense fulfillment in the relations between a man and a woman in the family. That ordering of human relations is a fundamental good attached to human nature itself.
<p>
We can see already how radically similar the views of revelation and natural law are on the nature of reality and of man. Order, reason, community, purposeful action, the goodness of being, sociability, sexual complementarity are essential to both.
<p>
Now we come to the part of the story that everybody knows best: the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Adam and Eve, you recall, could eat of all the fruit of the trees in the Garden except one. But the serpent was a persuasive advocate:
<p><blockquote>
	The serpent asked the woman, "Did God really tell you not to eat from any of the trees in the garden?"  The woman answered the serpent: "We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden; it is only about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God said, `You shall not eat it or even touch it, lest you die.'"  But the serpent said to the woman: "You certainly will not die!  No. God knows well that the moment you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods who know what is good and what is bad."  The woman saw that the tree was good for food, pleasing to the eyes, and desirable for gaining wisdom. So she took some of the fruit and ate it; and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. (Genesis 2:1-7.)
</blockquote><p>
The serpent said three things about this tree. Fruit is sweet tasting. Knowledge is a delight. And you can be like God. Now, I love caramel sundaes, but I can turn down a sweet. I revel in the life of the mind, but I don't really have to know everything. But to be like a God -- that's a dizzying prospect. The exegetes tell us that the temptation to Eve and to Adam was to define for oneself what the scheme of good and evil is instead of apprehending what is objectively good for man. If I can define for myself for my own world, if I can determine what is good and evil, then for that little world of my making, I am a god. The serpent did say something else. He said Eve would not die. In the end, the promise to be a god, as enticing as it may be, is always a false promise.
<p>
By eating the fruit, Eve names good and evil for herself. Remember that earlier in this chapter of Genesis, God had given Adam the right to name the animals, to distinguish them, to find their inner scientific order. But the naming of good and evil, God retains to himself. Man was given reason to apprehend good and evil, but he does not, in his nature, possess the capacity for creating it.
<p>
Aristotle teaches that a just man is one who practices virtue, and he defines virtue as the habit of acting rightly. When one acts rightly, one reflects or participates in the objective moral order (the image of God in the words of Genesis). But when one defines the moral order for himself, he images nothing but his own will. By definition, under the natural law, one cannot act virtuously if one is knowingly acting outside of the objective moral order.
<p>
Having asserted one's own will as defining good and evil, the results ineluctably follow. For, as the story of creation predicted, without order there is not nothingness, but the terror and distress of chaos.
<p>
There is first the disorder of the soul, in the form of shame. Second, social cohesion is shattered. God strolls through the Garden of Eden and accuses Adam of eating of the forbidden tree. And Adam dissembles: "The woman whom you put here with me -- she gave me fruit from the tree, and so I ate it."  (Genesis 2:12.) Even in the garden of Eden, the man abandons the woman. They are no longer friends. The bonds of sociability are broken. As soon as we take unto ourselves the right to define good and evil, we jettison the interconnectedness between one another that our natures call us to have. Trust vanishes.
<p>
Lest you think that such insights come only from a religious tradition, let me read to you Cicero:
<blockquote><P>
	True law is right reason in agreement with nature; it is of universal application, unchanging and everlasting; it summons to duty by its commands, and averts wrongdoing by its prohibitions.... It is a sin to try to alter this law, nor is it allowable to attempt to repeal any part of it, and it is impossible to abolish it entirely. We cannot be freed from its obligations by senate or people, and we need not look outside ourselves for an expounder or interpreter of it. And there will not be different laws at Rome and at Athens, or different laws now and in the future, but one eternal and unchangeable law will be valid for all nations and all times, and there will be one master and ruler, that is, God, over us all, for he is the author of this law, its promulgator, and its enforcing judge. Whoever is disobedient is fleeing from himself and denying his human nature, and by reason of this very fact he will suffer the worst penalties, even if he escapes what is commonly considered punishment. (<I>De Republica</I> 3:21.)
</blockquote><p>
Cicero never read Genesis.
<p>
The Supreme Court's definition of human nature in <I>Casey</I> has given us Eve without Adam, and Adam without Eve. We are solitary autonomous beings, unconnected, without responsibility for each other. The Court empowers us to define ourselves, to create our own universe, to be, as Genesis predicted, "like God."  In the same way in which the Supreme Court makes law without a constitutional standard, it has declared that there is no rule of law against which we must measure our own actions. We make the rule of law for ourselves, each one a different rule of law. So, for example, we often hear the familiar non sequitur, "I believe abortion is the taking of human life, but I would never want to impose my values on you."  It denies us the fundamental natural law standard of an objective basis of morality, and equally denies us the opportunity to strive to that perfection to which we are constituted.
<p>
That is our world today, and it comes from the disdaining of religion and of reason. The world of deconstructed philosophy, of private moralities, of God that cannot be mentioned in the public square leaves Eve without Adam, unborn children without their mothers, born children without their fathers, and the dying without hope. The homeless are not just those we see on the streets. Such a world leaves us all homeless. That is the Faustian bargain that the Supreme Court offers us in <I>Casey</I>.
<p>
Thus, there is little wonder that the philosophers of the school of natural law and the followers of revealed religion find themselves in a political, intellectual, and moral alliance today.

<p>
<b>Religious Doctrine and Human Liberty</b>
<p>
For the alliance of reason and faith to be effective, it must contend with issues of doctrine and with issues of liberty. The beauty of the natural law philosophy is that it is universal. It calls upon all persons to consider and freely to order their lives by an objective moral standard. Whether or not creationism can be justified scientifically, the rest of our society perceives it solely as a religious doctrine. Whether or not contraception is contrary to the natural law, the rest of our society perceives it as a Catholic doctrine. A simple rule of prudence requires that those values not be imposed. This is not to say, however, that the scientific shortcomings of evolutionary theory cannot be discussed. They should be. Nor that contraceptives should be distributed in the schools. We know the objective harm that brings and the invasion of the family it constitutes. But that is different from imposing those values as doctrines. Abortion, obviously, is qualitatively different because it is a universal question of how a moral society treats dependent life.
<p>
The other issue is liberty. Two points should be made here. First, we sometimes forget that under the plan of God, mankind was utterly free, except for eating of the tree of good and evil. As Pope John Paul II emphasizes, freedom and virtue depend upon there being an objective order, which we can accept or not. Without an objective moral order, there is no true freedom, for it has nothing to measure itself against. Second, modern natural law theory must acknowledge the great advances in the justification for liberty that 18th century natural rights theory made. Modern natural law theory, in its mature form, finds the freedom of the human individual rooted in the good, and holds that political authority is contingent upon that human freedom.
<p>
But what natural law offers in addition is that the free, flourishing individual prospers in his social relations, most especially in the family. What Adam Smith and John Locke presumed in their vaguely perceived notions of natural law and in the social experience of the Enlightenment was that these social relations would flourish of themselves. For the most part they were right. But we have learned in the two centuries past, and especially in this country, that those relations, the family, are much more fragile than we imagined and that for true liberty to be enjoyed, such relations need to be fostered and nurtured. For natural law not only judges what human laws ought not to be passed, but also illuminates the benign face of the law: It looks to those laws that ought to be enacted to assist human persons in the flourishing of their free individual personalities. Natural law is not only imperative; it is aspirational.
<P>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
When a philosophy -- even one like natural law -- is in the ascendancy, intellectual fatigue, as well as impatience with the imperfections any human system has, slowly brings on criticism and perhaps even rejection. But when order threatens to break down altogether, when chaos looms, then the mind reaches back to the stability of principle. Man cannot abide error for too long, for error produces a disintegration, a disorder of the soul, and a disorder of society. We can live a complex life; we can live a life of contradictions; but we cannot live an absurd life. That is our nature.
<p>
Whenever subjective relativism and objective truth have come into contest, whenever the choice is one or the other, man will ultimately opt for the truth, no matter how discomfiting it may be. Just look at whom we choose for heroes:
<p>
Is it Antigone or Creon?
<p>
Socrates or Alcibiades?
<p>
Is it Ruth, who embraces the One God despite the humiliation it brings, or her sister-in-law Orpah, who remains comfortable with the pagans?
<p>
Is it Lincoln or Douglas?
<p>
Solzhenitsyn or Brezhnev?
<p>
Jesus or Pilate?
<P>
Only when faith and reason are rejoined in mutually respecting friendship and are cognizant of liberty can the bonds of civil society, of civilization itself, be renewed. That moment may be upon us once again. May it come soon.

<title>Why Congress Should Not Impose Mandates on Private Health Insurance - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>WHY CONGRESS SHOULD NOT IMPOSE MANDATES ON PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE</h3>
By Carrie Gavora<br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 462<br>
September 18, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress is poised to enact legislation which, for the first time, would require private commercial health insurance carriers to provide specific benefits. Such federal mandates inevitably increase costs while limiting consumer choice and competition. In particular, these proposed mandated benefits would increase the costs of health insurance premiums for employers, who then would either limit health benefits or pass the higher costs on to workers and their families in the form of lower wages. Worse, Congress would be establishing a precedent for legislative determination of what medical benefits, treatments, or procedures Americans must have in their personal insurance plans.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Making Health Policy Through the Appropriations Process.</b> During consideration of H.R. 3666, the Veterans Administration and Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill, the United States Senate by voice vote approved an amendment offered by Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) that would require insurers to cover a mother and newborn for at least two nights in the hospital after a normal birth, and at least four nights after a caesarean section. Coverage for fewer days would be permissible if agreed to by the attending physician in consultation with the mother.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition, by a vote of 82 to 15, the Senate adopted a mental health "parity" amendment offered by Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Paul Wellstone (D-MN). This amendment -- a scaled-down version of the mental health parity provision dropped from the recently enacted Kennedy-Kassebaum health insurance reform bill -- would require group health insurers who offer mental health coverage and apply aggregate lifetime and annual payment limits on coverage either (a) to include plan payments made for mental health services under the aggregate lifetime and annual payment limits for medical or surgical services, or (b) to establish a separate aggregate lifetime and annual payment limit for mental health that is equal to or greater than the limit established for medical and surgical services. On September 11, the House of Representatives, by a vote of 392 to 17, passed a nonbinding instruction to conferees on the VA-HUD bill to adopt both provisions. Both the Bradley and Domenici-Wellstone amendments represent a not-so-subtle creep of government control over the health care market.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Compounding State Regulation.</b> The overregulation of health insurance at the state level is a problem for both small businesses and insurers. In 1970, there were 48 mandated benefit laws (laws requiring specific treatments, benefits, or procedures) nationwide. As of 1995, because of intense lobbying by medical practitioners and advocates seeking coverage for various diseases, the number had risen to over 920. And this does not include almost 100 so-called anti-managed care laws (such as "any willing provider" and "mandatory point of service" laws) by which states restrict the ability of managed care plans to contract with providers and establish cost sharing.<sup>1</sup>  The most prominent form of federally tax supported, employer-based health insurance is managed care. Because of the rapid expansion of this form of health care, with its restrictions imposed on both doctors and patients, state legislatures are rapidly increasing their regulation of the insurance industry. More than 1,000 managed care bills are being considered in state legislatures in 1996; 56 have been passed into law in 35 states so far.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Imposing Higher Costs.</b> The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that Senator Bradley's maternity benefit mandate would cost the federal government alone some $223 million over four years in increased outlays for Medicaid and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), and in lost revenues due to lower wages from increased health costs. The CBO also says that the new maternity benefit would increase aggregate premium payments for employee-based and individually purchased health plans by 0.06 percent. In addition to the extra costs for government programs, the CBO estimates that direct private-sector costs would increase by $180 million in 1998 and $220 million in 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

According to a CBO analysis conducted on behalf of the Senate Budget Committee, the estimated cost of the Domenici-Wellstone mental health parity provision of the VA-HUD appropriations bill is less than the earlier version -- estimated at $618 million over 5 years (the provision sunsets in 2001).<sup>3</sup>  The potential cost also was reduced somewhat by a modifying amendment, offered by Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX), stipulating that if a group health policy experienced a premium increase of 1 percent or more in a given year due to this provision, that insurance policy could be exempted from the mandate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While both amendments attempt to address real issues -- namely, the equitable treatment of mental health services and the health and safety of mothers and newborns -- they are bad public policy. The federal government should not be in the business of determining what benefits, treatments, or procedures private health insurance must provide to patients. This should be a contractual decision between consumers and insurers, and between doctors and patients. Whether to cover treatment for mental illness (or any illness) should be an insurance contract issue, not a political decision or an area for congressional intervention.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Moreover, experience at the state level indicates that mandates typically are the product of intense lobbying by provider interests rather than sound health policy. Thus, Congress should realize that once one group of practitioners begins to benefit from legally mandated coverage for its services, others will argue for similar legal guarantees. In the meantime, the price of legally privileged medical benefits hurts legally underprivileged medical practitioners, because businesses or insurers have to cut back other benefits to accommodate the new law. Desperately fighting for equal treatment, the excluded practitioners and advocates for certain disease groups lobby intensively for expansion of the mandates. The slippery slope of mandated benefits is transformed into  spiraling costs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Let Consumers Fire Bad Insurance Companies.</b> Rather than adopt bad health care policy, Congress should allow consumers to choose not only their health insurance coverage, but also the kinds of medical treatments and procedures they want at the prices they wish to pay. In a consumer choice system, individuals and families -- not employers or managed care companies -- would choose the health plans and benefits that best suit their needs. The mother of a newborn forced out of a hospital before her time should have the right to fire her insurance company. Individuals and families, given tax relief regardless of where they work, should be able to purchase comprehensive health insurance, including catastrophic coverage, without imposing high costs on the private health insurance plans of other workers and their families with different needs. While rhetorically packaged with phrases like "incremental reforms" or "patient protections," federal mandates -- especially on top of state mandates -- do nothing to reform America's health care system. All they do is raise costs and limit consumer choice and competition.

<li>The mental health parity provision agreed to earlier this year by the Senate would have imposed huge new costs on working families. The CBO estimated that premiums for traditional fee for service plans would increase by 5.3 percent, while managed care plans would cost the consumer an additional 4 percent. Understanding that it is workers and their families that ultimately bear the costs of mandated benefits, the CBO predicted that this provision would force employers either to cut back other benefits -- or health insurance altogether -- or to pass the higher cost of insurance on to workers in the form of lower wages.

<title>The Chemical Weapons Convention: Unverifiable, Unenforceable, and a Burden to Business - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION:
UNVERIFIABLE, UNENFORCEABLE, AND A BURDEN TO BUSINESS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>
<br>
Executive Memorandum No. 460<br>
September 12, 1996 <br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Later this week, the United States Senate will vote on ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).  The CWC is a multilateral treaty that would bar the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons by the countries that ratify it.  Given its sweeping provisions, the ratification of the CWC carries important implications for U.S. policies on  arms control, non-proliferation, defense, regulation, and above all, national security.  As a result, Senators need to consider the CWC carefully and not assume that it deserves support merely because it professes to outlaw chemical weapons.  In fact, the CWC will fail to achieve its stated goal of a global ban on chemical weapons.  Moreover, the CWC will make America more vulnerable to chemical weapon attack in the future while imposing an unwarranted and costly burden on American business. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	If ratified, the Chemical Weapons Convention would:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Increase the risk of chemical weapons being used.</b>  By undermining the U.S. chemical deterrent, the CWC may increase the likelihood that chemical weapons would be used.  The experience of World War II shows that an aggressor possessing chemical weapons will hesitate to use them to attack a country that also possesses such weapons. If the U.S. bans all of its chemical weapons, as required by the CWC, outlaw states that retain them will have a military advantage over the U.S. and other countries that have banned them. This military advantage increases the likelihood that chemical weapons could be used against the U.S.
 <p>
 <li><b> Be unverifiable.</b> Despite elaborate and burdensome verification provisions, compliance with the CWC cannot be adequately verified.  At a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, then-Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey warned that "the chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale."
 <p>
 <li><b> Be unenforceable.</b>  Violations of the CWC are likely to go unpunished. If a violation were to occur, the United Nations Security Council would have to impose penalties severe enough to change the behavior of an outlaw state.  But the five permanent members of the Security Council can veto any enforcement resolution lodged against them or their friends.  China and Russia, for example, can simply veto resolutions imposing sanctions on them if they disagree with other Security Council members.
 <p>
 <li><b> Impose a heavy regulatory burden on U.S. businesses.</b>  There are over 7,700 production facilities in the U.S. that may be subject to CWC-related reporting and inspection requirements.  The direct cost to business could be as high as $200 million annually, while indirect costs could run into billions of dollars a year.
 <p>
<li><b> Increase the risk of proliferation of chemical weapons.</b>  Article XI of the CWC requires cooperation among nations in the peaceful uses of chemicals.  In many respects, this provision resembles the 1950s Atoms for Peace arrangement to foster the peaceful uses of nuclear power.  This is the approach to arms control and trade that has been used to justify Russia's sale of nuclear reactors to Iran. The last thing the world needs is a "Poison for Peace" program that helps spread chemical weapons around the world, as the Atoms for Peace did for nuclear reactors to Iran and North Korea.
<p>
 The chief lobbying group for the chemical industry, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), supports ratification of the CWC, and the prospect for increased sales of dangerous chemicals to countries like Iran may be the reason why. CMA member companies that produce and export chemicals would be subject to stricter limits on exports if the U.S. does not ratify the CWC. It would be sad indeed if the CMA were putting its own economic interest ahead of the nation's security in supporting ratification.
 <p>
<li><b> Not enhance U.S. security.</b>  By making arms control an end in itself, the CWC will not protect U.S. national security.  Arms control is only one of several means for achieving the goal of national security. America needs the additional tools of deterrence, defenses, and even offensive military operations. It makes no sense for America to give up its chemical weapons if other nations still possess them.
<p>
<li><b> Be inconsistent with America's global responsibilities.</b> The CWC, by treating all nations alike, fails to acknowledge America's special role in global security. Superpower status imposes important global responsibilities which the U.S. can fulfill only by maintaining armed forces capable of projecting overwhelming force around the globe. Because America has these special responsibilities, it is treated as an exceptional case under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty regarding the possession of nuclear weapons.  The same principle should apply to America's chemical weapons arsenal.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Advising and consenting to the ratification of treaties is one of the Senate's most solemn constitutional responsibilities.  This is particularly so when the treaty under consideration has profound implications for the security of the nation.  Given all that is stake with the CWC, Senators should scrutinize carefully all the provisions and implications of the treaty before they vote.  This will lead to an inescapable conclusion: Ratifying the CWC would leave America less secure and would pose unreasonable costs on American businesses.

<title>Government's Hidden Tax: Time to Account for the Cost of Regulation - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>GOVERNMENT'S HIDDEN TAX: TIME TO ACCOUNT FOR THE COST OF REGULATION</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a><br>
Deputy Director for Economic Policy Studies<sup>1</sup><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 459<br>
September 10, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Senate is expected soon to consider <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/z?cp104:hr660.104:">H.R. 3756</a>, the Treasury and postal appropriations bill, which includes funding for the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB). On July 23, the Senate Appropriations Committee adopted an amendment -- Section 645, offered by Senator Ted Stevens (R-AK) -- requiring OMB to prepare an accounting statement that estimates the cumulative costs and benefits of federal regulatory programs. OMB already is responsible for reviewing regulatory actions to ensure that they are consistent with the Administration's regulatory principles and agenda.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While there is much debate about federal taxes, spending, and the need to balance the budget, considerably less is known and understood about the benefits and burdens of regulation. Unlike federal tax and spending programs, no comprehensive cost accounting system exists for regulation. But regulatory costs -- $677 billion in 1996 -- are nearly one-half the cost of direct taxation. And the economic impact is significant; according to one estimate, federal regulations cause $1.3 trillion in U.S. economic activity to be lost each year. Just as the annual federal budget allows policymakers and the public to debate and decide what programs to support and which ones to scale back and eliminate, information on regulatory costs and benefits would help them to determine what regulations do the most good for the money spent, set regulatory priorities accordingly, and minimize the burden on the economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>A Good First Step.</b> Under the Stevens proposal, OMB would be required to submit to Congress by September 30, 1997, a report on the cumulative costs and benefits of federal regulatory programs. OMB also must report on the effect of federal rules, both on the private sector and on the federal government, and provide estimates of the costs and benefits of rules costing more than $100 million annually. The public would have an opportunity to comment on the OMB report before it is submitted to Congress. OMB also would have to offer recommendations to Congress and the President about how to reform regulatory programs that are not a "sound use of national resources."  This is a sensible first step toward improving oversight and promoting greater efficiency throughout the federal regulatory system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This proposal will be criticized by federal regulators and politicians. Regulation is one of the most politically convenient ways to carry out public policy because it typically does not require substantial, direct taxation or government spending. This is particularly appealing in an era of federal budgetary restraint. The Clinton Administration has put at least 10,000 new pages of federal rules on the books since 1993. But how much has this cost, and what did the American people get for their money?  Because regulators gain power by regulating as much as possible, with little to stop them from regulating as if it cost nothing, opponents will use the same misleading rhetoric against this proposal that they used to defeat a far more comprehensive regulatory reform bill in 1995. The following three myths are typical:
<p>
<b>MYTH #1: It is doubtful that reliable estimates of costs and benefits can be developed.
<p>
<ul>REALITY:</b> There is no dearth of methodological tools available for estimating the costs and benefits of federal regulations. The Department of Commerce regularly surveys business establishments to collect information on expenditures caused by particular regulatory programs. Since 1981, every President has required federal agencies to consider costs and benefits in their regulatory decisionmaking. To assist them, OMB developed guidelines for such analysis. Even though federal agencies try to avoid any effort to measure the costs and benefits of their actions, dozens of these analyses have been done over the last 15 years. Between 1990 and 1995, for example, EPA did at least 70 rule-specific cost-benefit analyses. Ironically, in 1993, the Clinton Administration removed hundreds of rules from OMB review, de-emphasizing the need for cost-benefit analysis.
</ul><p>
<b>MYTH #2: Any attempt to measure the costs and benefits of regulations will consume a significant amount of new resources.
<p>
<ul>REALITY:</b> With more than 130,000 federal regulators spending more than $14 billion annually to develop and enforce regulations, how can more be needed?  The Clinton Administration itself recognizes that federal agencies -- which have been required to consider costs and benefits of regulatory actions since 1981 -- "are the repositories of significant substantive expertise and experience...."  In addition, OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which reviews rules before they are issued, has a fiscal 1996 budget of more than $5 million and a staff of about 30 analysts and economists with years of experience reviewing and evaluating agency cost-benefit analyses. During the Bush Administration, OMB reported on the aggregate costs of regulations in a publication that later was stopped by the Clinton Administration; no such information has been published since then.<sup>2</sup>  OMB already is in an excellent position to work with other agencies to prepare this statement, but Congress must demand that it be done and that it be made available to the public.
</ul><p>
<b>MYTH #3: This is just the first step in an effort to justify a "roll back" of important public health, safety, and environmental protections.
<p>
<ul>REALITY:</b> The opposite would be true. Strengthening the use of cost-benefit analysis in regulatory decisionmaking would mean higher levels of protection. A recent Harvard study estimated that current regulation of health risks is so inefficient that for the same investment of resources, we could save an additional 636,000 years of life--60,200 premature deaths every year-- simply by changing our priorities.
<p></ul>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration and its allies in Congress already are on record as supporting regulatory cost accounting as part of more comprehensive regulatory reform legislation in 1995. In addition, President Clinton's Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review requires federal agencies to "assess the costs and benefits" of regulations. The Stevens amendment simply suggests that the numbers should be added up so the American people can have some idea of the kinds of regulatory decisions their government is making and how good a job federal regulators are doing.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is a good first step, and Congress must go further and implement a regulatory budget like the one proposed in <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3277:">H.R. 3277</a> by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX). A regulatory budget would force federal regulators to operate within limits, much as an agency's fiscal budget does. Both Congress and the President would be accountable to the public for making sure that economic resources are allocated in a manner that produces the greatest benefit to society.

<title>OPIC-ing the Taxpayer's Pocket - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><font size="+2">OPIC</font>-ING THE TAXPAYER'S POCKET</h3>
By Brett D. Schaefer<br>
Research Assistant<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 458<br>
September 3, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When it returns from its August recess, the House of Representatives is expected to consider H.R. 3759, the Exports, Jobs, and Growth Act of 1996, which authorizes appropriations for the Trade and Development Agency (TDA) and export programs of the International Trade Administration (ITA) for fiscal years 1997 and 1998. But the heart of the Act extends the authority of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) to engage in new commitments through 2001 and doubles the statutory limits on OPIC's insurance and financing activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

OPIC insures overseas investments by U.S. businesses against loss to expropriation, political instability, and unforeseen contingencies, such as currency inconvertibility. It also issues investment guarantees and direct loans to U.S. businesses for international investments. The agency was created by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to complement the federal government's trade policy and development activities. Specifically, OPIC is charged with increasing U.S. exports and assisting American private capital in the development of less developed countries (LDCs) and countries in transition from non-market to market economies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Strangely, no one seems to notice the irony of using a government-run program to encourage other countries to end government interference in their economies. Congress should not expand OPIC's funding and authority. OPIC is another form of corporate welfare and accomplishes nothing that cannot be performed better in the private sector, without risk to U.S. taxpayers.
<p><ul>
<li><b>OPIC could cost U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars.</b> Proponents insist that OPIC makes a profit and actually decreases the deficit. But while OPIC did make $167 million in profits last year, largely from revenues of U.S. treasury bonds, this figure does not take into account the amount that U.S. taxpayers are obligated to pay as underwriters of OPIC-insured investments. In 1995 alone, OPIC issued policies covering $8.6 billion of investment. The accumulated value of insured investments is many times this amount. American taxpayers typically are liable for 90 percent of the insured investment in the event the policy must be paid.
<p>
Additionally, beginning in 1987, OPIC began dabbling in venture capital, one of the riskiest areas of the financial industry. Starting with the Africa Growth Fund, OPIC began creating numerous funds to encourage investment in less developed countries. These funds have several things in common: They are involved in the world's riskiest markets, are subject to little control or oversight by OPIC, and rarely turn a profit. These funds also have been growing precipitously, from $70 million at the beginning of the Clinton Administration to over $814 million last spring.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC "socializes" risk while privatizing profits. </b>Foreign investment is an important avenue for development in LDCs. U.S. foreign direct investment totaled $612 billion in 1994, with nearly one-third invested in the developing world, a total far exceeding the U.S. foreign aid budget. OPIC insured a very modest portion of this investment; the rest was insured by private businesses. Yet business and political advocates continue to argue that developing nations would not receive foreign direct investment without OPIC. The truth is that OPIC has become a corporate welfare program that subsidizes investment insurance and loans for private businesses. <i>Fortune</i> 500 companies realize large profits while the taxpayer buys the insurance to offset their investment risk in less developed countries.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC's development agenda has been ignored.</b> H.R. 3759 uses export promotion to justify increasing OPIC's insurance and lending authority, but discussion of OPIC's second mission -- its development agenda -- is curiously absent. This is because OPIC actually works against the best interests of LDCs. Representative Sonny Callahan (R-AL) claims that "as long as these countries, such as India, do not have a track record of adherence to free market principles, OPIC is needed."  In fact, however, OPIC is not needed. It encourages countries to maintain harmful economic policies, such as refusing to guarantee property rights, engaging in harmful regulatory policies, demanding oversight of investments, and insisting on government ownership of whole sectors of the economy. It simply is not wise to engage in business in such an environment. To attract foreign investment, countries need to enact free-market economic policies. Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Chile, and the Czech Republic have done so with marvelous success. However, OPIC continues to encourage investment in less developed countries regardless of their economic climate.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC does not promote exports effectively.</b> Not one country receiving OPIC insurance policies or loans is among the top 10 destinations of U.S. exports, despite the fact that four of the top ten (Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore) are developing nations. OPIC focuses on countries that cannot attract foreign investment on their own because of their poor economic policies and dangerous instability. Instead of letting these countries reap what they sow, OPIC rewards them with investments underwritten by American taxpayers.
<p>
Additionally, OPIC employs many restrictions on its lending and insuring practices that have nothing to do with the viability of the investment. For example, many countries that fit the normal criteria for OPIC political insurance and loans are ineligible because they do not meet U.S. standards in such areas as human rights, environmental concerns, and workers' rights. Countries that are excluded from OPIC lending for these reasons include South Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Mexico. In other words, political correctness is more important than maximizing the return on taxpayers' money.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC competes with the private sector.</b> One of the justifications for OPIC is that there supposedly are no alternatives in the private sector. But numerous private-sector businesses specialize in political risk insurance, including American International Group (AIG), EXEL Ltd., and Mid Ocean Ltd. OPIC competes directly with these private-sector institutions and offers advantages beyond the resources of privately held companies. OPIC political risk insurance is backed by the U.S. government, whose resources far exceed those of a private insurer. OPIC offers subsidized insurance premiums at rates far below market rates. OPIC policies extend for 20 years, while the private sector in most instances cannot issue policies for longer than three or seven years for reasons of risk. OPIC continues to compete unfairly with the private sector, despite the fact that its authorizing language instructs it specifically to promote the development of private-sector political risk insurers.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

At the very least, OPIC should be required to limit its activities to those which complement rather than undermine the activities of private-sector political risk insurers. OPIC, for example, could supplement private political risk insurance by issuing policies for the time window beyond that typically offered by the private sector. Ideally, however, OPIC should be eliminated and its commitments privatized.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Proponents claim that OPIC cannot easily be privatized. To bolster this claim, they cite an independent study which estimated that privatization would cost American taxpayers between $500 million and $700 million. This is a large sum, but it pales in comparison to the potential cost to U.S. taxpayers if major economic or political upheavals occur in areas of the world with OPIC-insured projects. The potential liability to the U.S. is in the billions -- in effect, a global version of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s, for which the American taxpayer is still paying.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. government should not intrude in areas where the private sector is willing and able to do the job, can do it more efficiently, and can do it without forcing American taxpayers to underwrite risky ventures. Encouraging foreign investment is an admirable goal, but it should not come in the form of government subsidies to private U.S. firms -- subsidies that discourage economic reform in the target countries and put the American taxpayer at risk.

<h3>HOW MILWAUKEE'S CHOICE PROGRAM HELPS POOR CHILDREN SUCCEED IN SCHOOL</h3>

F.Y.I. No. 120<br>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

School choice for poor children is likely to be an issue this year in many state and congressional races. The idea that low-income parents should be able to select the schools -- public or private -- they think best for their children strikes at the very heart of America's educational <i>status quo</i>. Lawmakers and parents therefore need to pay close attention to the quality of academic evaluations of school choice programs, including the samples used and methodologies employed. Evaluations of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, school choice experiment are a case in point.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1990, Milwaukee instituted the nation's first publicly funded school choice program, giving low-income parents vouchers to send their children to private schools. In February 1996, data from the Milwaukee school choice experiment were made available. Professors Jay P. Greene of the University of Houston Center for Public Policy and Paul E. Peterson of Harvard University's Program in Education Policy and Governance have conducted a detailed assessment of this information.<sup>1</sup>  Their study, released at a conference this summer, reveals that:
<p><ul>
<li> The reading scores of choice students in their third and fourth years were, on average, from 3 to 5 percentile points higher, respectively, than those of comparable low-income public school students.
<p>
<li> Math scores, on average, were 5 and 12 percentile points higher for the third and fourth years, respectively.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The implications of these findings are extremely significant. As Greene and Peterson note, "If similar success could be achieved for all minority students nationwide, it could close the gap separating white and minority test scores by somewhere between one-third and more than one-half."<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Before the release of the Greene and Peterson study, the Milwaukee school choice program had been evaluated each year by the man who designed it: political science professor John Witte of the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Witte had concluded that "This school experiment [has] not yet led to more effective schools.... Choice creates enormous enthusiasm among parents... but student achievement fails to rise."<sup>3</sup>  Because Witte and his fellow researchers did not release their data for secondary analysis by other members of the academic community until this year, their evaluation was the sole source of information on the test performance of Milwaukee school choice students. Many academic specialists, foundations, and policymakers therefore had concluded that while school choice clearly satisfied parents, it was not effective in improving the education of low-income central-city students.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Based on their own examination of the data, however, Greene and Peterson found that the statistical model used by Witte and his colleagues failed to replicate the "character" of the MSCP experiment. The most significant flaw was that Witte's group compared choice school students with a much less disadvantaged cross-section of Milwaukee public school students. Witte had compared the choice students to a general sample of public school students, a group which was significantly different in several ways. For example, the choice students were more likely to come from households headed by poor, minority, single mothers, making any comparison between them and the public school sample misleading.<sup>4</sup>  Correcting for these errors, Greene, Peterson, and their colleagues at the University of Houston and Harvard designed their own study -- a study which confirms a growing collection of evidence showing that private school vouchers are the key to educational success for students who are financially trapped in failing inner-city public school systems.
<p>
<b>HOW THE HOUSTON-HARVARD STUDY WAS DONE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Greene and Peterson designed an analysis that would correct for the methodological errors of the Witte study. The difference between their conclusions and Witte's is the result of a scientific methodology made more rigorous in several ways. Among them:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Random assignment of students to the test and control groups.</b>
<p>
The Houston-Harvard analysis compared the choice students with students who applied to the choice program but were not admitted. The mandate imposed on the Milwaukee voucher program by the Wisconsin state legislature required Milwaukee's choice schools, if oversubscribed, to admit applicants at random; the result was two randomly selected groups of students: those who were chosen to participate in the program and those who were not. The system thus set up a unique opportunity for researchers to compare students in the choice program with public school students from otherwise eligible families whose parents had made an effort to seek an education for them at a private school. This improved "control" for the extent to which families value education and desire to participate in the program meant that any differences in outcome could reasonably be attributed to the experimental condition of choice. 
<p>
<li><b> Controlling for grade, year, and school.</b>
<p>
Students seeking to participate in the Milwaukee choice program applied each year for a place in a particular grade in a particular school (with spots, as indicated above, to be assigned randomly if the program was oversubscribed). The evaluation data allowed the Houston-Harvard researchers to control for both the grade to which a student applied and the year of application. Although the specific schools to which students applied were not included in the data, researchers were able to control for that variable by taking into account the ethnicity of applicants. Over 80 percent of the choice students attended one of three schools; and virtually all of the students who applied to one of these schools were Hispanic, while virtually all who applied to the other two were African American.<sup>5</sup>  The Witte study had failed to take into account that the selection of students was random only by grade, school, and year.
<p>
<li><b> Measuring academic effects as cumulative.</b>
<p>
Rather than merely measure the changes in test scores from year to year as Witte did, the Houston-Harvard researchers measured the cumulative effect of the choice program on test scores for each child for the entire time the child was in the program. Controlling for gender, the test scores of choice students were compared with those of "non-selected" students who had applied the same year for the same grade and were of the same ethnicity. The effects of choice schools on test performance were small during the first and second years; during the third and fourth, however, choice students made substantial gains. According to statistical tests, positive results of this magnitude would not appear had Milwaukee choice schools had no effect on academic performance. One of the most egregious errors of the Witte study was that it controlled for a student's test score in the prior year, in effect controlling for the outcomes of the choice program and incorrectly assuming that students learn at uniform rates.
<p>
<li><b>Testing for possible errors due to limited data.</b>
<p>
As Professor Witte states, "In terms of demographic characteristics, non-selected... students [and choice students] came from very similar homes....  They were also similar in terms of prior achievement scores and parental involvement."<sup>6</sup>  However, the data available to the Houston-Harvard researchers covered only 76.2 percent of the selected students and 58.7 percent of the non-selected students. To ensure that these two percentages accurately represented the selected and non-selected groups overall, the Houston-Harvard researchers made several additional analyses:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Family background.</b> Controlling for family background was difficult. Both test and background questionnaire data were available for only 36.7 percent of the families of selected students and 21.8 percent of the families of non-selected students. Even among those parents who did return a questionnaire, many did not respond to all of the items. Trying to balance between controlling for additional factors and preserving the size of the sample, the Houston-Harvard team controlled for family income and the mother's education. Those factors were chosen for two reasons: 1) Past academic research shows that these factors strongly affect a child's educational performance, and 2) most parents who returned questionnaires responded to those particular questions. Adding these two variables to the analysis decreased the sample size but changed the results very little. This confirmed that there were no significant differences in family background between those for whom complete background data were available and those for whom they were not.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Prior test scores.</b> Two groups randomly assigned to two categories, as was the case in this study, can be assumed to be similar. Thus, the Houston-Harvard study did not control for test scores prior to the Milwaukee program. Because of missing data, however, the researchers checked and found that at the time these two groups applied to the Milwaukee choice schools, the available data showed that they had essentially the same test scores. In fact, those who were not selected scored one percentile point higher in both reading and math. Although the sample size for this analysis was reduced by the fact that test scores at the time of application were available only for a limited number of applicants, a statistical analysis was run on the figures that were available. With only one exception -- the fourth year reading scores, which had to be based on only 26 observations -- the results controlling for prior test scores were not substantially different from those found in the main analysis. This confirmed that there were no significant academic differences between those students whose prior test scores were reported and those whose scores were not reported.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Potential "selection effects."</b>  The Houston-Harvard study's main analysis clearly revealed statistically significant effects in the third and fourth years of a student's program. This presents two possibilities: 1) Either students benefit in measurable ways from the choice experience only after participating in the program for three or more years, or 2) students remain in the program for three to four years only if they are benefiting from it. To determine which was the case, the Houston-Harvard researchers analyzed the first and second year scores of students for whom test results were also available in years three and four. The effects of the first two years were no different from the effects for all first and second year students. This would imply that the positive effects of school choice accumulate over time and are not due to different student retention rates.
</ul>
<p>
<b>OTHER RELEVANT STUDIES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Houston-Harvard analysis is more methodologically sound than previous studies of the Milwaukee school choice program. More important, its basic conclusions are supported by a growing body of research on the value of private schools among urban poor and minority children.
In 1990, the Rand Corporation of Santa Monica, California, examined the academic performance of children in New York City's public and Catholic school systems. The results were startling: Some 95 percent of Catholic high school students graduated, for example, while only 25 percent made it out of the public schools. Similarly, 75 percent of Catholic students took the Scholastic Aptitude Test, but only 16 percent took it in the public schools.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A 1982 study headed by education scholar James Coleman of the University of Chicago found that students in Catholic schools were one grade level ahead of their public school counterparts in mathematics, reading, and vocabulary.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1993, the New York State Department of Education found that Catholic schools with 81 percent to 100 percent minority composition outscored New York City public schools with the same percentage of minority enrollment in Grade 3 reading (+17 percent), Grade 3 mathematics (+10 percent), Grade 5 writing (+6 percent), Grade 6 reading (+10 percent), and Grade 6 mathematics (+11 per cent).<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the 1993 New York State Department of Education study also found that Catholic and public schools have similar percentages of students from troubled families with low incomes, Anthony Bryk from the University of Chicago reports that Catholic schools expel far fewer children.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Derek Neal, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, in a study conducted for the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, found that among urban blacks and Hispanics nationwide, the probability of high school graduation rises from 62 percent to 88 percent when a student is moved from a public to a Catholic high school. The probability of college graduation for these children rises from 11 percent to 27 percent. In addition, when compared with their public school counterparts, minority students in urban Catholic schools can expect roughly 8 percent higher wages in the future simply because they are more likely to complete high school and college.<sup>11</sup>

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
School choice is becoming increasingly popular, and polls show it is most popular among urban African Americans --  the very group served by a program like Milwaukee's. Because black parents are less satisfied with public schools, they want an alternative. A recent study by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank that specializes in research on African Americans, found that only 5.7 percent of African Americans rated their local public schools "excellent," compared with 19.9 percent of the general population. Conversely, 16.5 percent of the black sample rated their schools "poor," compared with only 7.4 percent of the general population.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to the claims of the education establishment, choice does not leave children of poor families in failing schools. Rather, it is their ticket out. Schools of choice have proven their ability -- and their desire -- to improve the academic outcomes of poor children. Recently, Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York offered to take the lowest performing 5 percent of students in New York City's public schools into New York's Catholic schools, where they can succeed. This also would be a huge financial advantage for taxpayers. New York's Catholic schools educate students at about a third of the cost of public schools. A 5 percent transfer would save New York City over $250 million a year.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The academic success of Milwaukee choice students, as well as other students who have been fortunate enough to escape failing urban schools, is now a matter of record. It is time for state legislators and Members of Congress to give other lower-income children the same opportunity.

<title>Tougher U.S. Action Needed to Punish Saddam Hussein - Heritage</title>

<h3>TOUGHER U.S. ACTION NEEDED TO PUNISH SADDAM HUSSEIN</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration's cruise missile strikes against Iraq this week in retaliation for Saddam Hussein's military offensive against the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq are too little too late. The U.S. needs to take firm, consistent, and systematic action if it is to rebuff Saddam's latest aggression, undermine his brutal regime, and undercut his ability to threaten his neighbors and repress his own people. In responding to the immediate crisis, the U.S. needs to keep sight of its long-term goals -- forcing Saddam's downfall and diminishing Iraq's threats to regional stability and the flow of oil.
<p>

<b>WHAT IS AT STAKE?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Saddam's invasion of the Kurdish enclave is not just a blow aimed at Kurdish and other Iraqi opposition forces; it is a clear test of the U.S.-led coalition's determination to contain Iraq. Saddam knows that the Kurdish cause is unpopular in Turkey, which is fighting its own Kurdish separatists, and among America's Arab allies, who wish to preserve Iraq as a counterweight to Iran. Saddam hopes to drive a wedge between the U.S. and other members of the anti-Iraq coalition by portraying his aggression as a defensive move against Iranian-supported Kurdish separatists.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Iraq's latest provocation also is an inevitable consequence of an aggressive dictator's perception of U.S. weakness. For three-and-a-half years, the Clinton Administration has conveyed an image of weakness and indecision in defense and foreign policy, particularly regarding Iraq. Clinton came into office severely underestimating the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. One week before his inauguration, Clinton offered Saddam the chance to let bygones be bygones in a <i>New York Times</i> interview: "I'm a Baptist; I believe in deathbed conversions."  Clinton proclaimed that he was "not obsessed with Iraq," as if bilateral tensions were a product of George Bush's personal pique toward Saddam. The Clinton Administration softened U.S. policy toward Iraq and dropped the Bush Administration's insistence that Saddam be ousted before the U.S. would agree to lift the United Nations embargo on trade with Iraq.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Iraq launched a failed attempt to assassinate former President Bush in Kuwait in April 1993, the Administration equivocated before launching cruise missile attacks against the Baghdad headquarters of Iraq's foreign intelligence agency on June 27, 1993. This attack was a mere slap on the wrist for such a brazen terrorist plot against a former American President. The limited size and symbolic nature of the U.S. reprisal -- 24 cruise  missiles fired at an empty building in the middle of the night -- probably did little to strengthen U.S. deterrence against Saddam's aggression.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More recently, the Clinton Administration has failed to respond to other Iraqi provocations. Since April, Baghdad repeatedly has blocked the efforts of U.N. arms inspectors to monitor compliance with Iraq's obligations to dismantle its nuclear, chemical, biological, and long-range missile programs. Yet the Administration has done little except to pass the problem off to a listless U.N. Security Council. In May, Iraqi opposition leaders reportedly warned U.S. officials that the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan was deteriorating and required urgent American attention. But the Administration was asleep at the switch and failed to resolve diplomatically the growing tensions between Kurdish factions that erupted in open warfare last month. One faction, the Kurdish Democratic Party, then went so far as to ally itself with Saddam, who has ordered the deaths of thousands of Kurds, in despair over its failure to receive significant material or diplomatic support from Washington.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Saddam has probed aggressively for U.S. weakness, again and again. What is at stake in the current crisis is not just the future of Iraq's Kurds, but the ability of the U.S. and its allies to deter future Iraqi aggression.
<p>
<b>THE U.S. RESPONSE: WHAT NEXT?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration has responded correctly with military force, the only language Saddam Hussein seems to understand. But the limited cruise missile strikes launched so far make sense only as the opening phase of a robust and systematic air campaign to punish Saddam's aggression, weaken his military threat to his neighbors, and deter future Iraqi aggression. Incremental pinprick reprisals are unlikely to make Saddam blink. Such attacks more likely will encourage him to escalate the crisis even further.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To drive home to Saddam the heavy price that he must pay for aggression, the Clinton Administration should hit the Iraqi dictator where he will feel it most. The U.S. should launch cruise missile and air strikes against the security forces that prop up Saddam's dictatorship -- the Republican Guard and secret police -- as well as against Iraq's military assets and military industries. The U.S. goal should be to punish Saddam and his closest supporters while undermining his ability to maintain himself in power, repress the opposition, and threaten Iraq's neighbors. The Administration also should seize the opportunity to destroy suspected Iraqi weapons manufacturing and storage facilities that were barred to U.N. arms inspectors. This will make the Iraqis think twice before illegally interfering with such inspections in the future.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Administration's decision to expand the southern "no fly" zone from the 32nd parallel to the 33rd is wise because it tightens the constraints on Iraq's air force and diminishes Iraq's military threat to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Moreover, it drives home to Saddam and the Iraqi military that the U.S. has the will to impose significant costs for aggression on a broad range of fronts, including imposing humiliating restrictions on Iraq's military operations. This will increase the incentives for a military coup against Saddam by disgruntled army officers concerned with rebuilding Iraq's military strength, especially if U.S. air attacks weaken the Republican Guard, which is an elite military force that is loyal to Saddam.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Washington must insist on the immediate and total withdrawal of Iraqi troops from the Kurdish areas. But the U.S. should not focus exclusively on compelling an Iraqi withdrawal. Saddam could pull back his troops a few miles and still use his feared secret police to maintain control of the areas he has occupied. He also could easily move his troops back into the area in the future. Moreover, focusing primarily on the Kurdish issue will only help Saddam split the already weakened anti-Iraq coalition. The issue for the U.S. is not so much protecting the Kurds from Iraqi aggression as diminishing Saddam's ability to engage in <i>any</i> act of military aggression with impunity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Saddam continues his aggression in Kurdistan or engages in new provocations elsewhere, the Clinton Administration should mount a methodical and sustained air campaign against military, military industry, and secret police targets throughout Iraq as long as Saddam's troops remain in the Kurdish enclave. The Administration also should mount a high-priority diplomatic offensive to end the factional fighting between the rival Kurdish groups. But the U.S. should avoid basing its policy exclusively on the narrow issues of protecting the Kurds or enforcing U.N. resolutions. This would only play into Saddam's hands by allowing him to retain the initiative. U.S. policy should be focused on punishing Saddam, deterring future aggression, and destroying his ability to threaten more important U.S. interests in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

<h3>WHAT THE 104TH CONGRESS DID TO COMBAT CRIME</h3>




By <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a><br>
Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies<sup>1</sup><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 117<br>
August 19, 1996<br>

</center>



<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 104th Congress has delivered on its promise to enact specific measures to improve federal crime-fighting efforts and help state and local officials combat violent crime. Most of these anti-crime measures were initiated by conservative Members of the House of Representatives, based on promises made to the taxpayers in the Contract With America, and later incorporated into bills passed by the Senate. They include a solid program of truth in sentencing for violent criminals, effective death penalty provisions, restrictions on the power of federal judges to put criminals back on the streets, a reordering of federal funding from social programs to law enforcement efforts (including prison construction and police funding), and victim restitution.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two major vehicles for enactment of most of these measures were the comprehensive Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (S. 735), sponsored by former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS), and the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019). While more can be done at the federal level, more also needs to be done by state and local officials who bear the primary responsibility for fighting violent street crime.<sup>2</sup>  Nonetheless, the legislative record of the 104th Congress in combating crime is impressive and far-reaching.<p><b>KEEPING THE BAD GUYS OFF THE STREETS</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first duty of government is to protect the people. As a short-term measure, the most effective way to do this is to put more violent criminals in prison and keep them there. In fulfilling this duty, Congress enacted the following measures into law:
<p>
<b>Violent Criminal Incarceration Act of 1995 (H.R. 667).</b> A major failure of the criminal justice system has been the inability or unwillingness to identify, target, and incarcerate violent criminals for long periods of time. Violent criminals typically serve only one-third of their sentences.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under this new law, states will receive Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants for the construction of prisons on condition that they keep violent criminals locked up for at least 85 percent of their sentences. Already, more than 20 states have adopted such truth-in-sentencing laws,<sup>3</sup> and it is likely that many more will adopt such measures to keep violent criminals behind bars and off the streets.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bill passed the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995; was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019); and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</b> During the past three decades, federal judges have seized control of state and even local prisons, dictating conditions of confinement, promoting more comfortable living conditions for convicts, and releasing inmates as a way to ease overcrowding. Federal judges have been releasing inmates without finding a violation of a specific federal or constitutional right. Over 500 municipalities and 1,200 state prisons have been operating under judicial orders or consent decrees. Under Section 3626 of the 1994 federal crime bill, Congress attempted to stop lenient federal judges from imposing caps on the number of prisoners that can be incarcerated at a particular prison,<sup>4</sup> a judicial practice that has resulted in the release of violent criminals before their terms have been served.<sup>5</sup>  Liberal lawyers and judges quickly found ways to get around this provision.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act, originally sponsored by Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL), closes existing loopholes by imposing tighter restrictions on federal court-ordered prison population caps. It requires a three-judge panel to find that prison crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a prisoner's legal or constitutional rights. Moreover, it requires judges to find that there is no other remedy available before they impose a prison cap. State or local officials responsible for the prosecution or custody of criminals who could be released because of judicially imposed prison caps are granted standing to sue. The Prison Litigation Reform Act also specifies that court-ordered relief from incarceration is to be based on specific violations of a prisoner's constitutional rights and that federal judges must give substantial weight in their decisions to any adverse impact of such relief on public safety or on the operation of the criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure also reduces the burden of frivolous prisoner lawsuits, which include a wide range of often strange and bizarre complaints. Inmate lawsuits are estimated to comprise 25 percent of all civil suits filed in federal courts, and state officials are burdened with responding to them. Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon has compiled a "top ten" list of the most frivolous of these lawsuits, including complaints against officials who do not provide salad bars and brunches on weekends and holidays, officials who do not pay food allowances of $26 a day to inmates traveling from prison to the courthouse, and officials who do not permit male inmates to wear such female apparel as bras, panties, lipstick, and artificial fingernails.<sup>6</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the new law, federal courts are authorized to dismiss frivolous or malicious suits "without hearing."  Moreover, all administrative solutions within the corrections system must be exhausted before a lawsuit can be filed in federal court. The measure also limits the lawyers' fees awarded to successful inmate plaintiffs. In the past, trial lawyers have received as much as $300 per hour for representing prisoners.<sup>7</sup>  Under this Act, fees will be based on an hourly rate no higher than that for other court-appointed counsel, and any monetary damages awarded to a prisoner in a successful suit against state prison authorities must be applied to outstanding restitution owed to the victims of his crimes.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019) and signed into law as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>To disapprove certain sentencing guideline amendments (H.R. 2259/S. 1254).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI), requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission to submit new guidelines imposing higher penalties for crack cocaine than powder cocaine, and higher sentences for "high level" as opposed to "low level" drug trafficking. It rejects previous guidelines that would have lowered penalties for crack cocaine to those for powder cocaine. The law stipulates that new guidelines also should include stiffer penalties for drug traffickers who use a dangerous weapon, possess a firearm, or involve or injure children or other vulnerable individuals when committing an offense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill passed the Senate on September 29, 1995; passed the House of Representatives on October 18, 1995; and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-38.
<p>


<b>MAKING PUNISHMENT SWIFT AND SURE</b><p>
<b>The Alien Deportation Improvement Act of 1995 (H.R. 668).</b> Originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law would expedite deportation procedures for non-resident aliens convicted of serious felonies, as well as bribery, counterfeiting, trafficking in stolen vehicles, perjury or subornation of perjury. It also would permit deportation of a permanent resident alien who has been sentenced to five or more years for an aggravated felony.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure, originally titled the Criminal Alien Deportation Improvements Act of 1995, was passed by the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995, and later incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132).
<p>
<b>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 (H.R. 779).</b> While there is considerable debate over the ethics or wisdom of imposing the death penalty, the empirical evidence indicates that the death penalty in the United States is used sparingly. In 1995, there were 2,976 criminals on death row, but the states have executed 263 criminals since 1973. The abuse of <i>habeas corpus</i>, enabling those on death row to file petition after petition seeking to overturn their sentences or convictions, has been a major weakness of the American criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure reduces delays in carrying out capital sentences while preserving the right of those convicted of capital crimes to present valid claims in federal court. It also imposes time limits for the filing and judicial consideration of petitions; ends the practice of filing multiple petitions except in the rarest instances; requires that state prisoners seeking <i>habeas corpus</I> relief must exhaust all state remedies before bringing action in federal court; and specifies that if a state gives reasonable consideration to the petitioner's claim, the federal judge must deny that claim.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 was passed by the House of Representatives on February 8, 1995; incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as part of Public Law 104-132.
<p>


<b>HELPING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The central congressional approach to law enforcement assistance is the block grant, which allows local law enforcement officials to secure more funds, hire more police personnel, and have even more flexibility in using these monies to combat crime at the local level.
<p>
<b>Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants Act of 1995 (H.R. 728).</b> This measure authorizes federal grants for local law enforcement officers while giving them the flexibility they need to fight crime in ways they deem most appropriate for their communities. Unlike the police funding in the 1994 crime bill, these funds are targeted to communities with high crime rates. $503 million has been appropriated for FY 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill was passed by the House of Representatives on February 14, 1995; incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Anti-Car Theft Improvements Act (H.R. 2803).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, advances the investigation of car theft by setting up the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS). This system, to be managed by the Department of Justice and maintained by the states, is intended to serve as a reliable and accessible body of information on motor vehicle titling for law enforcement officials.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This law was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 20, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public law 104-152.
<p>

<b>JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS</b><p>

<b>Victim Restitution Act of 1995 (H.R. 665).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, requires judges in federal felony cases to order restitution to victims in cases involving violent crimes, offenses against property, or tampering with consumer products, as well as crimes in which an identifiable victim has suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss. The law also authorizes the federal courts to make restitution a condition of probation or parole.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This Act was passed by the House of Representatives on February 7, 1995; passed by the Senate on December 22, 1995, and incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-132.
<p>
<b>Sexual Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995 (H.R. 1240).</b> Sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law imposes strong sentencing guidelines for criminals convicted of creating or trafficking in child pornography and the interstate transportation of children with the intent to use them in such criminal activity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 1240 was passed by the House on April 4, 1995; passed by the Senate on April 6, 1995; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-71.
<p>
<b>Megan's Law (H.R. 2137).</b> Sexually violent criminals often are repeat offenders, and their presence in local communities is an obvious concern for families with children. Under this law, sponsored by Representative Richard Zimmer (R-NJ), criminals convicted of these crimes must register their addresses with state law enforcement officials, and communities will be informed when these offenders move into their neighborhoods.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill was passed by the House of Representatives on May 7, 1996; passed by the Senate on May 9, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-145.
<p>
<b>Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 3525).</b> This new law, sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL), makes it a federal crime to damage religious property or obstruct any person's free exercise of religion where the offense is in, or affects, interstate commerce.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 3525 was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 26, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-155.

<p>
<b>PENDING ANTI-CRIME LEGISLATION</b>
<p><b>Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 (H.R. 3814).</b> This bill provides $680 million for prisons and $571 million for block grants to local law enforcement. It passed the House on July 24, 1996, and currently is before a conference of the House and Senate.
<p>
<b>Interstate Stalking Punishment and Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 2980/S. 1729).</b> H.R. 2980 makes it a felony to cross a state line to stalk someone or to cross a state line in violation of a restraining order. The House of Representatives passed this bill on May 7, 1996. S. 1729, an identical bill sponsored by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), was passed by the Senate.
<p>
<b>Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 666).</b> This bill, sponsored by Representative McCollum, would establish an exception to the exclusionary rule, which bars the use at trial of any evidence gathered by police officers in violation of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. The narrow qualification created by this legislation would allow the admission of evidence obtained by police officers who, while they technically violated proper procedure, acted in the "reasonably objective belief" that their actions under the circumstances complied with Fourth Amendment protections. The bill classifies any information obtained pursuant to, or within the scope of, a warrant as evidence obtained in good faith.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The House of Representatives passed this bill on February 8, 1995. It has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
<p>
<b>Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996 (H.R. 3565).</b> This bill, also sponsored by Representative McCollum, would allow federal prosecutors to try violent juvenile offenders as adults. It also includes tough, mandatory sentences for juvenile criminals who use firearms in the commission of a federal violent crime or drug trafficking offense, and authorizes additional funding for juvenile justice programs and grants to states, allowing them greater flexibility in combating the growth of violent juvenile crime. The bill was marked up by the House Judiciary Committee on July 16 and 17, 1996, and referred to the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth, and Families, which approved sections under its jurisdiction.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the United States Senate, John Ashcroft (R-MO) introduced S. 1245, a similar bill. The Subcommittee on Youth Violence of the Senate Judiciary Committee has held hearings on the Ashcroft bill.
<p>
<b>Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996 (S. 1675/H.R. 3456).</b> This bill would enhance the federal effort to track convicted sex offenders. Cosponsored by Senators Phil Gramm (R-TX) and Joseph Biden (D-DE), the legislation would establish a federal tracking system, accessible to the public, to document the location of sex offenders, making it more difficult for these criminals to hide their records when applying for jobs, housing, or youth service programs. A version of the bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Zimmer. Hearings on the bill have been held before the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Judiciary Committee.

<title>High Layoffs and Long-Term Unemployment Cloud Jobs Picture - Heritage</title>

<center><h3> HIGH LAYOFFS AND LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT CLOUD JOBS PICTURE </h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a>, Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy <br>
<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 115<br>
August 5, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c1.gif">Chart 1:</a> Announced Layoffs for the First Six Months of 1996 Continue at Rapid Pace<br>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c2.gif">Chart 2:</a> Compared with Previous Economic Expansions, Long-Term Unemployment Remains High<br>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c3.gif">Chart 3:</a> Manufacturing Employment Has Declined for the Last Year and Remains 6.2 Percent Below 1989<br>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Since the end of the last recession in March 1991, the total number of payroll jobs has grown by 11.4 million to a total of 119.7 million, and the unemployment rate has declined from 6.8 to 5.4 percent. Despite this good news, many workers continue to be apprehensive about their economic future. In fact, one of every five Americans believes jobs are hard to get, and well over one of every ten believes there will be fewer jobs in the future.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A look at the data behind the total number of jobs created and overall unemployment rates reveals why Americans are concerned.<ul>

<p><li>Announced job layoffs continue at a rapid pace, with layoffs at near record levels for the 1990s. Displaced workers who did find new jobs did so at an average of 8.2 percent lower wages.

<p><li>Long-term unemployment remains stubbornly high. The percentage of long-term unemployed is at record levels for this stage of an economic expansion.

<p><li>Overall real earnings growth is stagnating, and men's real earnings continue to decline.

<p><li>The number of high-paying manufacturing jobs continues to decline -- down 282,000 since March 1995 -- and weak economic growth is limiting job opportunities for many Americans.
Focusing on just the total number of new jobs and the low overall unemployment rate without taking these sobering facts into account paints a misleading picture of economic growth and job opportunities.<sup>2</sup>  The economy is still failing to perform as well as similar expansions.


</ul><p>
<b>ANNOUNCED LAYOFFS CONTINUE AT RAPID PACE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
After a flurry of press attention last winter, the continued pace of corporate downsizing has gone largely unnoticed. Despite this, many workers remain concerned about their job security. One-half of all Americans believe that jobs are not very plentiful,<sup>3</sup> and 46 percent believe the economy is getting worse.<sup>4</sup>  New jobs may be available, but they usually pay substantially less and may not have the same benefits.<ul>

<p><li>Announced job layoffs for the first six months of 1996 were the second-highest this decade (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c1.gif">Chart 1</a>).<sup>5</sup>  Layoffs were 28 percent higher than the first half of 1995 and 6.0 percent ahead of 1993, the largest downsizing year of the decade.

<p><li>So far this year, the telecommunications industry has announced layoffs totaling almost 43,000; the food industry, over 25,000; the computer industry, over 22,000; the retail industry, over 21,000; and the automobile industry, almost 18,000.

<p><li>The median weekly earnings of displaced workers who found new jobs were 8.2 percent less than for their old jobs.<sup>6</sup>  They were over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old. One of every five displaced workers who found new jobs was no longer covered by group health insurance.
</ul>

<p>
<b>LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS HIGH</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How long Americans are unemployed (duration) is just as important as the level of unemployment. An unemployment rate of 7.5 percent with most workers out of work for only a week as they change jobs or are recalled from layoff is significantly better than an unemployment rate of 5.5 percent with many workers still struggling to find work six months after losing their last job. Because of weak economic growth, long-term joblessness has not declined as rapidly as it normally does after recessions.<sup>7</sup>
<ul>
<p><li>Long-term unemployment remains stubbornly high.<sup>8</sup>  <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c2.gif">Chart 2</a> shows that the proportion of Americans unemployed for at least six months remains unusually high after five years of modest economic growth. Since the end of the last recession, the proportion of unemployed who have been out of work for six or more months has not dropped significantly for youths (ages 16 to 24), black Americans, and service workers.

<p><li>After six months of looking for work, almost one of every five unemployed managers and professionals still has not found a job.<sup>9</sup>

<p><li>The overall unemployment rate also does not reveal significant problems facing workers in various age groups, industries, or occupations. While the total unemployment rate was 5.4 percent in July 1996, the rate for all teenagers was 16.4 percent, and the rate for black teenagers was 33.1 percent.
</ul>

<p><b>EARNINGS GROWTH STAGNATES, MEN'S EARNINGS STILL DECLINE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the past five years of modest economic recovery and expansion, the real median usual weekly earnings for all full-time wage and salary workers has stagnated.<sup>10</sup>  For men, real median weekly earnings have declined 5.1 percent. For black and Hispanic Americans, the decline has been even worse: 5.4 percent and 8.2 percent, respectively.
<ul>
<p><li>After increasing 2.5 percent from the first quarter of 1991 to the first quarter of 1993, the index of real hourly compensation has not increased.

<p><li>Over the past five years, only workers in the finance, insurance, and real estate industries have seen their real average hourly earnings improve substantially.
</ul><p><b>

WEAK ECONOMIC GROWTH LIMITS JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMERICANS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although total employment and unemployment numbers are significant, they often do not convey important information about problems various age groups, industries, or occupations may be having. There actually are fewer manufacturing jobs now than when the economic recovery began five years ago, and the dismal pace of economic growth has meant no substantial improvement in job opportunities for men and minorities. Workers in some occupations have not yet regained the ground they lost in the last recession. For example:
<ul>
<p><li>Since March 1991, the percentage of the population employed has increased 1.4 percentage points to 63.2 percent.<sup>11</sup>  The percentage of men employed, however, has increased only 0.5 percentage points and still remains well below its 1989 peak of 72.8 percent.

<p><li>The employment-population ratio for white teenagers has increased 0.7 percentage points to 48.0 percent since March 1991 but remains well below the rate of 53.4 percent reached in August 1989.<sup>12</sup>  Likewise, the employment-population ratio for black teenagers has increased 2.0 percentage points to a disappointing 25.8 percent since March 1991 but remains well below the pre-recession rate of 32.4 percent reached in July 1989.

<p><li>The number of manufacturing jobs has declined 282,000 to 18.3 million since March 1995, and is down almost 1.2 million since its peak in 1989 (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c3.gif">Chart 3</a>).<sup>13</sup>  Durable goods manufacturing employment has increased only 55,000 over the past five years and remains below its 1989 peak by 794,000 jobs. Manufacturing workers have regained only 1 of every 5 jobs lost between 1989 and 1993.

<p><li>The number of Americans working in high-skilled technician and related occupations has declined 478,000 since July 1992, and the number of workers in administrative support and clerical occupations has declined by 298,000.<sup>14</sup>

<p><li>The number of Americans working in precision production, craft, and repair occupations has declined 13,000 to 13.4 million from March 1991 to July 1996 and remains 519,000 below the peak of 14.0 million reached in March 1990.
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the creation of 11.4 million additional jobs since the end of the last recession, workers continue to be concerned about their economic future. The average annual growth rate of the past seven years has been the worst economic performance since the end of World War II.<sup>15</sup>  Layoff announcements for the first half of this year were the second-highest this decade, long-term unemployment remains high, and real earnings growth has stagnated for the past five years. Focusing only on total job growth and the low unemployment rate without taking these facts into account paints a misleading picture of economic growth and job opportunities.

<a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Trend and Quarterly Real GDP Growth 1976-1996
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On August 1, the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is scheduled to release its preliminary or "advance" gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimate for the second quarter of 1996. This number, good or bad, inevitably will make front-page news and may have a significant impact on the presidential campaign. Just as inevitably, this preliminary number most likely will turn out to be wrong, for quarterly GDP data historically have been subject to substantial later revisions, sometimes so significant that the original estimate tells nothing about the course of the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A single quarter estimate of the growth in GDP usually is a poor signal of the long-term direction of economic growth. Consider the following examples:<ul>

<p><li>The GDP growth estimate for the first quarter of 1996 has been revised downward by 21 percent (from 2.8 percent to 2.2 percent).

<p><li>During the last year of the Bush Administration, the first quarter 1992 advance estimate of GDP suggested an annualized growth rate of 2.0 percent. The subsequent revision of the GDP for that quarter showed that growth in the quarter actually was at an annualized rate of 4.7 percent. This is a 135 percent revision between the preliminary and final estimates.

<p><li>As it turns out, the BEA underestimated the growth rate during the Reagan Administration in 63 percent of its advance estimates. During the Clinton Administration, the BEA so far has overestimated the growth rate on over 69 percent of the occasions on which it published advance estimates.

<p><li>The BEA concedes that in 12 percent of the quarters between 1978 and 1991, the advance GDP growth estimate failed even to indicate correctly whether growth was positive or negative.

<p><li>The average divergence between the advance estimate of GDP growth and the final GDP growth rate between 1976 and 1996 was equivalent to 50 percent of the value of the final GDP growth rate.
</ul>

<p>
<b>WHY DOES QUARTERLY GDP FLUCTUATE SO MUCH?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Measuring GDP changes is a very complex task, made all the more difficult by the fact that quarterly GDP figures are very volatile.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Gross domestic product (GDP) represents the total value of goods and services sold for final consumption by U.S. firms and individuals. It consists of four major components: personal consumption; investment (including business inventories and both residential and nonresidential fixed investment); net exports; and government purchases of goods and services. Fluctuations in any of these individual components of GDP in a given quarter can cause large changes in the quarterly growth rate. The components which typically have the largest and most common fluctuations are changes in business inventories and in government purchases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A glance at the quarterly GDP growth figures for the last quarter of 1995 illustrates this point. Despite an annualized growth rate in personal consumption expenditures of 1.2 percent and a respectable annualized increase in nonresidential fixed investment of 3.1 percent, overall annualized growth in this quarter was at a recession-like low of 0.5 percent. The reason: An annualized fall in government purchases of over 12 percent during the winter shutdown of 1995-1996 drove down GDP during this quarter.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Similarly, a number of one-shot factors probably will drive a significant increase in GDP for the second quarter of 1996. One leading econometric consulting firm, the St. Louis-based Macroeconomic Advisers,<sup>3</sup> for example, cite a number of factors to support their prediction of a 3.7 percent annualized growth rate for this quarter. These factors include the complete recovery of government purchases following the winter shutdown, the end of the UAW strike at General Motors, an increase in the number of home mortgage refinancings stimulated by lower interest rates (which put extra cash into the hands of consumers), and the economy's recovery after the harsh winter weather.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The extent to which these short-term factors can influence quarterly growth figures can be gauged by looking more closely at what is happening to business inventories. Due to the GM strike and the harsh winter, business inventories fell substantially in the first quarter of 1996 as production experienced a slowdown. Macroeconomic Advisers predicts that over 38 percent of their projected growth in GDP (1.4 percent from a total annualized growth rate of 3.7 percent) in the second quarter of 1996 will come solely from firms restocking their inventories as production gets fully back on line.
<p>


<b>WHY ADVANCE ESTIMATES OF GDP GROWTH TEND TO BE WRONG</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Measuring GDP is a massive and complicated undertaking that involves attempting to record the total sales of all goods for final consumption for the entire United States. The BEA produces its estimates based on sample sales data from a number of individuals and firms, collected during every month. Prices for thousands of individual items are estimated using sample data. Taken together, these comprise virtually millions of data points.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The problem is that when the advance estimate is published only 30 days after the close of the quarter, not all of these data have been examined -- or are even available. In 1984, for example, top BEA official Robert Parker noted that for sales of all consumer goods, other than autos and trucks, only data from the first two months of the quarter were available when advance estimates of national income were being made.<sup>4</sup>  To estimate the GDP growth in such a case, with data either missing or unexamined, BEA economists must rely on a combination of extrapolation and guesswork. But given the turbulent nature of quarterly GDP changes, this guesswork often is very inaccurate. These factors mean that large revisions need to be made as the complete dataset becomes available and is examined in full by the BEA.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The revisions also tend to be large because the GDP growth rate is a rate of change. Thus, errors of a small magnitude in total GDP can lead to large errors in the growth rate. For example, if the actual GDP growth rate is 2 percent, even a small error in total GDP could translate into a large error in the actual growth rate, perhaps even 50 percent. In this context, it is not surprising that advance GDP growth estimates often vary substantially from the real figures.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, despite the fact that advance GDP growth estimates are subject to frequent and large revisions, they are quickly seized upon by politicians of both parties either to support their own records or to attack those of their opponents. And unlike the publication of advance estimates, revisions of these quarterly data by the BEA hardly make the news. This process of correcting and finalizing GDP estimates can last for months -- even years -- following that initial release and can result in huge revisions which tell a completely different story about how well the economy performed.<sup>5</sup>  <a href="fyi114c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows the difference between the initial "advance" estimates of the real annualized growth rate of GDP and the most up-to-date revisions of these figures for the period since 1976.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<a href="fyi114c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows the difference or "error" between the advance and the most up-to-date revised estimate of the GDP growth rate. The "magnitude of the initial error" refers to the amount by which the advance GDP growth rate was later revised. Thus, if the advance estimate was a 3 percent annualized growth rate and the revised rate was 2 percent, the absolute error was 1 percentage point, which represents a revision of 33 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In most cases, the error is substantial; on a number of occasions, it exceeds the real growth rate itself. Among recent examples of large errors is the first quarter of 1992, when the BEA's advance estimate of GDP growth underestimated the real annualized growth rate by a factor of 135 percent (the advance annualized real growth estimate was 2.0 percent; real annualized growth in that quarter was actually 4.7 percent, according to the latest revision). The BEA also has revised downward its estimate of the growth rate for the first quarter of 1996 by a factor of almost one-third.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

An analysis of the revisions contained in the BEA's monthly <I>Survey of Current Business</I> over the 20-year period from 1976-1996 shows that these recent examples fit a general pattern over many years. In the 80 quarters between the first quarter of 1976 and the first quarter of 1996, the average magnitude of the total revision in annualized real GDP growth amounted to 1.4 percent of GDP. The average quarterly annualized growth rate in GDP over this period was 2.8 percent. This means that the average divergence of the advance estimate of GDP growth from the actual revised figure was equivalent to 50 percent of the value of the actual revised growth rate. According to BEA economist Allan Young, "advance" GDP growth figures failed even to show correctly whether GDP growth was negative or positive in 12 percent of all quarters over the period 1978-1991.<sup>6</sup>  Taking the Reagan years as an example, the BEA's advance figures underestimated the growth rate in roughly two-thirds (63 percent) of all quarters. Likewise, during the Clinton era, the BEA so far has overestimated the rate of growth in about 70 percent of all of its advance estimates.
<p>

<b>WHY IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO LOOK AT TRENDS IN GDP</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because of the poor accuracy of advance estimates of GDP and the extreme volatility of quarterly GDP growth rates, a far better picture of the economy emerges from looking at the underlying trends. <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a> shows the trend<sup>7</sup> in economic growth compared with the <I>revised</I> quarterly GDP growth rates between the first quarter of 1976 and the second quarter of 1996.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The data in <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a> show two major patterns in the rate of economic growth in recent years: an acceleration in growth rates between the first quarter of 1992 and the final quarter of 1994 and a deceleration in the growth rate beginning after the peak in 1994 and continuing through to the current period. Both the expansion and the slowdown in the economy, however, have been punctuated by misleading "spikes," or individual quarters when the GDP growth rate diverged from the trend. For example, during the first quarter of 1993, in the middle of an expansion, the growth rate of GDP fell to zero. More recently, the economy showed strong above-trend growth in the third quarter of 1995.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As can be seen from <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a>, individual quarterly GDP numbers are a rough and often misleading signal of the long-term and medium-term strength of the economy. Quarterly GDP figures can fluctuate widely because of factors that are unique to that quarter and which pose no long-term implications for economic prosperity.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Americans should not be lulled into a false sense of either economic prosperity or impending economic decline by estimates of the economy's performance during a single quarter. The advance estimates that are scheduled to be released on August 1 are likely to be revised considerably in the weeks and months to come. And even if these quarterly snapshots actually were accurate, quarterly GDP numbers fluctuate considerably for reasons unconnected with the long-term economic growth rate. Americans should not allow themselves to be deceived by these numbers and the political posturing surrounding them; rather, they should pay attention to the longer term patterns in the economy.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives too often approach environmental issues without a clear framework within which to explain to the public how the objectives of environmental protection and economic growth can both be achieved. This failure has allowed many conservatives to be characterized falsely as "anti-environmental."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is little understanding among Americans either of the need to reform environmental laws to maintain -- or improve -- protection for health, safety, and the environment, or of the fact that this can be done while simultaneously making them less burdensome to the economy. Until conservatives can explain more clearly why protecting the environment is not synonymous with adopting the "environmentalist agenda," they will be unable to build public support for badly needed reforms.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although current environmental laws have not worked well, conservatives have not developed a cohesive vision to help Americans understand how these laws should be reformed. Moreover, when criticized by liberals, they have failed to challenge liberals to respond with proposals to reform these programs. It is important to show that the good intentions of current law often are accompanied by oppressive, senseless regulations. But it is imperative that conservatives also show why their policies would do a better job of protecting the environment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Specifically, conservatives should stress the following themes:
<P>
<b>THEME #1: The Failure of Liberal Policies.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives need to explain that existing statutes have had many severe side effects. Among them:
<ul>
<li><b> Exorbitant costs with little return.</b> Conservatives need to explain that while costs have continued to skyrocket, the benefits being purchased have plummeted. Indeed, many of these increasingly expensive regulations now do more environmental harm than good.
<p>
<li><b>Property confiscation and loss of economic freedom.</b> Conservatives need to explain that private property is being taken from Americans through unfair regulation, and that many government "solutions" to environmental problems conflict with basic property rights.
<p>
<li><b>Lost opportunities cost lives.</b> Conservatives need to explain that the policies of the environmental agenda save few lives while squandering scarce economic resources that could be used to save more lives if dedicated to more serious risks. In effect, today's badly designed policies can kill.
</ul><p>
<b>THEME #2: A Positive Vision.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives need to articulate more clearly a positive approach to the environment that emphasizes:
<p><ul>
<li><b>An ethic of conservation.</b> Conservatives need to explain that the need to conserve  natural resources-- or use them efficiently --  is not in dispute. The debate is over how best to do that -- through markets or through government controls. For instance, a market-based approach would greatly reduce air pollution, and at far less cost.
<p>
<li><b>Property-based solutions.</b> Conservatives need to explain that the best way to achieve many environmental objectives is to create incentives associated with property ownership, not to issue thousands of pages of rules. For instance, property rights can be used to protect threatened species more effectively.
<p>
<li><b>Priority setting saves lives.</b> Conservatives must explain that not all things are equally important or urgent, and that regulating all risks equally means fewer lives saved for the dollars spent than would be the case if priorities were set. Conservative policies can save more lives. For instance, reforming Superfund would save more lives by focusing efforts on eliminating the highest risks more quickly.
<p>
<li><b>States do a better job than the federal government.</b> Conservatives need to explain that states are in a better position to deal with environmental matters within their borders than is the federal government. For instance, with the safety of drinking water supplies determined by states, the states would likely no longer squander resources obeying federal mandates that, until the Safe Drinking Water Act was recently reformed, required them to test for chemicals not even found in unsafe levels. Instead, they might focus on the far more mundane but persistent, serious, and largely ignored problem of bacterial contamination.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives have erred in putting too much political stock in the significance of horror stories -- absurd or onerous cases of environmental regulation. Public dismay at these stories does not signify broad-based support for deregulation. Americans understandably fear that if the "regulatory safety net" were dismantled, the country would return to the days of smokestacks billowing black smoke and burning rivers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That is why the message of balancing environmental protection and a strong economy has fallen on deaf ears. The public is easily convinced that the argument for deregulation is just shorthand for rolling back environmental protections. And many conservatives fan this fear by adopting decidedly anti-environment rhetoric. For conservatives to be successful in convincing the public to support more reasonable environmental policies, they must explain them far more clearly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A track record must be developed by which the public's hopes are met and their fears quelled. Most people want more freedom, a stronger economy, and a cleaner environment. The challenge is to show Americans how to obtain more of each.
<p>
<b>CRAFTING A SUBSTANTIVE MESSAGE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most Americans want both a strong economy and a clean, healthy environment. The problem is that environmental regulations can be enormously expensive, and can cost jobs and stifle economic opportunity. On the other hand, without environmental protections, robust economic activity, particularly manufacturing, often led to a deteriorating and unhealthy environment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A generation ago, as people perceived that their quality of life was beginning to deteriorate, they began to support aggressive policies to reduce pollution levels. These policies frequently failed in their aims and became increasingly and unnecessarily expensive, but the environment did begin to improve. Today, many Americans are becoming aware that many of these policies are unreasonable and that, even when they work, they seem to bring only small improvements in the environment at a heavy cost in jobs and freedom. Moreover, many Americans are beginning to recognize that there often is no sound scientific basis for assertions of environmental harm or risk to the public. As families and businesses have begun to feel the economic effects and loss of liberty caused by these policies, the pendulum has begun to swing the other way.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like most other people, conservatives have no wish to return to the days of black smoke billowing out of smokestacks.<sup>1</sup>  But they do want common sense brought to bear in dealing with the environment; they want reasonable environmental protection without having to sacrifice their freedom. At the same time, however, Americans generally want to be assured that reform will not lead to environmental deterioration. In other words, they trust conservatives to create jobs but question their environmental track record. If conservatives want to win the environmental debate, therefore, they must build that record and convince Americans that they hold the same values.
<p>
<b>HOW LIBERAL POLICIES FAIL</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While pollution levels have dropped dramatically since 1970, most of these reductions were achieved early in that period and at relatively low cost. From 1970 to 1990, total emission levels fell by about 34 percent. Over the same period, lead levels in the air fell 97 percent, and carbon monoxide levels in the air fell 41 percent.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As late as 1986, the annual cost of environmental protection was an estimated $87 billion. Since then, it has doubled to $174 billion.<sup>3</sup>  Meanwhile, environmental gains, which initially were very great, have slowed to a trickle as the federal government has run out of easy fixes and then attempted to eke out minuscule improvements in the environment at huge extra costs. These costs now represent about 3 percent of America's gross domestic product (GDP), or almost $1,800 per household per year.<sup>4</sup>

<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff> Larry Mason's family sawmill employed 40 workers in Beaver, Washington. Says Mason, "in 1990, the spotted owl injunctions closed our mill, made my equipment worthless, and my expertise obsolete."<sup>1</sup>
<p>Bill Stamp's family in Exeter, Rhode Island, has been blocked from farming or developing its 70 acres of land for 11 years, yet has been assessed taxes at rates determined by the land's industrial value. As a result, this fifth-generation farm family may lose their farm.
<p>Environmental regulations to "protect" people can cause death. The best example is the set of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, intended to conserve energy and keep oil prices down. The only way auto makers can meet the CAFE standards is by building lighter autos. Unfortunately for drivers and passengers, lighter autos are less able to withstand the impact of crashes. This substantially raises the number of highway deaths; the expected number for 1989 model year cars alone is 2,500.

</TABLE><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Environmental regulations also have caused immense hardships for businesses and small property owners alike. In the name of protecting the environment, powerless individuals have been forgotten as their businesses flounder because of expensive "command and control" regulations that tell them what to do and how to do it. The cost to individuals often is not a factor in the design of rules. Likewise, and without compensation, property owners often are required to forfeit the right to use their land for its intended purpose because regulators want to use it for wetland preservation or endangered species habitat. This can ruin them financially.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ironically, despite the skyrocketing costs and increasing hardship for ordinary Americans, the current system does not guarantee that the environment will continue to improve, or that Americans' lives will become any safer and their quality of life any better. In fact, there is much evidence to suggest the opposite. For instance, instead of working to protect species, the current implementation of the Endangered Species Act has become the main impediment to recovery of species.
<p>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why is this?  Consider that not a single species has recovered as a direct result of the Act.<sup>5</sup>  The few taken off the list so far were recovered for unrelated reasons (for example, the Bald Eagle, which benefited from a separate law protecting it) or because they were listed improperly in the first place even though always numerous (for example, the tumamoc globe berry). But when a listed species is discovered on a person's property,  the government  may restrict the landowner's right to use his property productively in order to preserve the habitat. The result: Landowners threatened with losing their livelihoods and property have little incentive to help maintain habitat. Indeed, the opposite is true. They are encouraged to eliminate habitat, perhaps through clear cutting, before restrictions are imposed in order to escape the devastating financial consequences. Thus, instead of encouraging landowners to protect endangered species, the Act often encourages them to destroy them.

In addition, some environmental regulations may be an indirect cause of deaths among Americans. A seminal Harvard University study found that 60,000 lives are lost unnecessarily each year because of the current regulatory regime. Dr. Tammy Tengs, now at the University of California at Irvine and the author of the study, summarizes this phenomenon: "[W]hen we spend resources on interventions that save lives at a high cost, we forego the opportunity to spend those same resources on interventions that save lives at low cost.... At our current level of resource consumption, we could double the survival benefits of our expenditures. Alternatively, we could retain our present level of risk reduction and, in addition, save billions of dollars."<sup>6</sup>

Viewing the problem from a different perspective, the regulations themselves can be fatal. Statistical analyses have shown that for every $7.5 million in costs the government imposes on the economy, overall worker living standards are lowered enough to cause one additional statistical death.<sup>7</sup>  When this formula is used to compare the number of lives "saved" by a particular environmental regulation with the number of lives lost through lower living standards, it turns out that many regulations actually increase the death toll.
<p>
<b>HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is important for conservatives to approach the issue in a commonsense way that people can understand. Given the general skepticism, they must stress that the environment is something they want to maintain and improve -- and show that they mean it, not just with environment-friendly rhetoric, but with substantive policies that benefit the environment. Only by building a positive environmental agenda and track record can conservatives show that their reforms would create jobs and economic growth while also helping the environment. People need to be told that, while environmental protection need not come at the expense of jobs, it will cost jobs unless the model of centralized control of environmental protection is rejected. A better approach would be based on:
<p><ul>
<li> A conservation ethic (freedom with responsibility);
<p>
<li> Property rights;
<p>
<li>Priority setting; and
<p>
<li> A strong state role.
</ul>
<p>
<b>The Need for a Sensible Conservation Ethic</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives traditionally have stressed economic growth while ignoring the importance of environmental problems. Thus, they have fought environmentalists step by step -- and have lost step by step. The reason is not complicated: Environmentalists have occupied the moral high ground, even though they typically have not provided the most beneficial solutions. In short, conservatives have been on the wrong side of an emotional issue.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are two lessons to bear in mind:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>First,</b> what leftists and the public at large understand is that publicly owned goods free of constraints on use will be depleted over time.<sup>9</sup>  Garrett Hardin, Professor Emeritus of Human Ecology at the University of California, in his seminal 1968 work <i>The Tragedy of the Commons</i> showed that when a good is publicly owned (or "owned" in common), no one has an incentive to conserve or manage it. In fact, there is a perverse incentive to use the good inefficiently (to deplete it) as each user tries to reap the benefits for himself. This fact is at the heart of most environmental problems such as air and water pollution and species extinction.
<TABLE  align=left width=50% border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>
<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff>
Ten percent of the cars and trucks on the road cause over half of the pollution emitted by autos  and 20 percent of the autos cause more than 88 percent of the pollution. Yet the liberal approach has been to tighten standards for newer, cleaner cars rather than to attack the heart of the problem  -- older cars and untuned cars, and especially older untuned cars, which pollute heavily. Rather than making more regulations that add hundreds of dollars to the cost of millions of new automobiles to reduce their already low pollutant emissions by a few percent -- and aggregate auto pollution levels by even less -- it makes more sense to cut pollution levels by making the real culprits shoulder their share of the burden. Requiring heavily polluting cars to pay locally set fees or penalties based on the levels of pollution they emit as measured by remote sensing (similar in concept to a radar gun) could reduce car pollution levels dramatically, and at a fraction of today's onerous and illogical regulatory approach. Indeed, a pilot program by the state of Utah showed car pollution could be cut dramatically and cheaply simply by giving free tune-ups to the worst polluters. Moreover, by driving up the cost of new cars, regulations cause older polluting cars that are less expensive to be kept on the road longer, which works against the goal of lowering pollution.

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Second,</b> if there are incentives to conserve resources, people will conserve out of self-interest. Thus, giving people a vested interest in providing environmental benefits (for example, through property ownership and other positive incentives) encourages them to provide such benefits voluntarily.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When it comes to certain resources like the air and water, conservatives have tended to ignore the first lesson, and consequently have lost the opportunity to implement the second.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Freedom with responsibility for one's actions" should be the conservative message. Responsibility restrains wasteful behavior. The old environmentalist slogan "Make the polluter pay" actually is consistent with this message. But when they say this, conservatives and liberals mean different things. As Al Cobb, then Director of Environment and Energy at the National Policy Forum, says, "What the environmental lobby means by that phrase is that corporate polluters should be punished severely for any pollution whatsoever. What conservatives mean, however, is that polluters should bear the full cost of environmental degradation, but no more."<sup>10</sup>  Put another way, individuals and corporations should be given the incentive of reaping rewards for conservation and environmentally sound practices.
<p>
<b>HOW PROPERTY RIGHTS ENCOURAGE CONSERVATION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The free market actually encompasses the conservation ethic better than command-and-control regulation from Washington. A free market can occur, however, only if private citizens can engage in trade, and people can trade only what they own: some form of property. Thus, property is the cornerstone of a free market. If property rights are insecure or publicly owned, a market cannot function effectively. Some critics call this "market failure," but it really is a failure to use markets and their main engine: property rights. As a result, both environmental protection and personal liberty suffer. Resources that are not owned will be depleted or will deteriorate because neither protection of nor damage to those resources is part of the decision-making process. Others nevertheless are subjected involuntarily to the consequences of those decisions.
<TABLE  align=right width=50% border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>
<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff>
<ul>
<li>In the decade 1979 -- 1989, East and Central African elephant herd populations dropped from more than 1 million to less than half that. Yet in Zimbabwe, elephant herds have increased dramatically. The difference is that in Zimbabwe, hunting is permitted as a property right. Small villages that own the land on which elephants live and graze charge safari operators to conduct hunts. Since the villages profit directly, they have an incentive to promote herd growth to increase their income. In surrounding African countries, government bureaucrats seem unable to curb incessant poaching. But in Zimbabwe, villagers are constantly on the lookout for poachers because they cost the village income. Zimbabwe and a few other countries reward the conservation of elephants by allowing the conservationists themselves to profit from their protective behavior. In each country where this approach is practiced, elephant herd sizes are increasing.
<p><li>In Scotland and England, the popularity of fishing has burgeoned in recent decades. In these countries, property rights to fishing sites have developed which formed the building block for markets to provide access to prime fishing spots. As a result, many private, voluntary associations have formed to purchase fishing rights access.<sup>1</sup> In Scotland, "virtually every inch of every major river and most minor ones is privately owned or leased . . . . "<sup>2</sup> Owners of fishing rights on various stretches of the rivers charge others for the right to fish. These rivers are not overfished because it is not in the owner's best interest to allow the fish population to be depleted. The owner wants to continue charging fishermen for the foreseeable future, so he conserves his fish stock, allowing them to reproduce, and prevents pollution from entering his stretch of the river. If a municipality pollutes the water upstream, the owner of the fishing rights can stop it by suing for an injunction. Everyone wins, including fisherman desirous of quality fishing with some privacy.
<p><li>
One group's approach to wetland protection has shown the power of property rights to achieve environmental goals. Ducks Unlimited (DU), a group consisting of hunters and non-hunters alike, is dedicated to enhancing populations of ducks. To do this, it has purchased property or conservation easements with privately raised funds. Unlike other groups that started as hunting/outdoorsmen organizations but have largely lost their original focus, Ducks Unlimited has kept its focus on the protection of duck habitat.3 In the last 58 years, it has raised and invested $750 million to conserve 17 million acres of habitat in Canada alone, which benefits other wildlife as well as ducks. In 1994, it restored or created about 50,000 acres of wetlands. Since DU pays market prices for the habitat it protects, this group in many ways embodies the essence of the conservative message, which is to allow the market to determine the best and highest use of a good or resource -- in this case, duck habitat.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives should concentrate on explaining the innovative ways property rights can be used to protect the environment. The most efficient method -- and the one that best protects individual rights and freedoms -- is to enlist self-interest in the service of environmental protection.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unfortunately, property rights are under attack in the U.S. from the environmental lobby. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states, "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation," but this has been interpreted to give absolute protection only against physical takings or complete devaluation of property. Most property-rights infringements, however, involve federal bureaucratic decrees that owners may not use their property as they see fit (for example, by continuing to farm it). Since the courts have been unclear as to the degree of protection these property owners should have from such intrusions, legislative protection is needed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Protecting and using property rights, either in a stand-alone Act or as part of Endangered Species Act reform, would work to protect species in America. The Act does not work. Indeed, as many species are delisted because they become extinct as are recovered. The Fish and Wildlife Service now virtually ensures that threatened plants and animals will suffer because of the disincentives thrust upon landowners who understand that the value of their land and their economic security will be wiped out when federal agents tell them they no longer can make use of their property. Merely taking away this fear by promising compensation would be a large step in ensuring peaceful coexistence between species and owners of the property on which the species live. Moreover, property rights automatically will work to help species whenever there is an economic incentive to do so, such as protecting valuable fishing streams. But property also can be put to work to benefit species. If property owners were given financial rewards whenever threatened species bred on their lands, the species would not be threatened for long. It is no accident that cows, pigs, and chickens are plentiful in this country; people have an incentive to breed them. It is time this lesson was applied to other species.
<p>
<b>WHY PRIORITY SETTING IS IMPORTANT</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Ask the average American how much a human life is worth, and you probably will be told that "no amount is too much."  This is the answer that Congress and federal agencies use to justify imposing sometimes staggering costs on businesses to reduce the risk of death by infinitesimal amounts. While this allows policymakers to posture as saviors of life, these policymakers also generally fail to understand that wasting resources in this way means not using them in other ways that could produce better results and save more lives.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economy has a limited ability to absorb environmental regulations. Simply put, the country cannot afford to eliminate every risk. There is an inherent trade-off: Attempting to regulate one risk out of existence may mean having to tolerate others. Thus, it is critical that regulators recognize the opportunity costs of their actions. Spending enormous amounts of money to eradicate small or even hypothetical risks means not being able to use those dollars in productive ways -- publicly or privately -- that would benefit the nation more.


<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It makes no sense to impose burdensome costs on consumers by, for example, regulating chemicals that are much less dangerous than everyday risks which average Americans, understanding that the danger is minimal, willingly accept. Yet that is exactly what the government does. For instance, the government routinely bans or regulates chemicals -- sometimes at the cost of billions of dollars -- whenever they pose a one-in-a-million chance of cancer, while simultaneously ignoring non-chemical risks hundreds of times greater that would be far less costly to regulate.
<p>
<TABLE  align=left width=50% border=1 cellpadding=15 hspace=15 vspace=15>
<TR><TD bgcolor=#eeeeff>
Priority setting will save lives and improve people's lives. The cleanup of old industrial wastes, embodied in Superfund, is a good example. The biggest problem with the law today is that cleanups are progressing at an incredibly slow pace, partly because money is being spent on lawyers to fight cleanups instead of on the cleanups themselves. Moreover, the law has stymied attempts to revitalize poor inner cities; few industries are willing to locate on sites there because of the risk of liability for cleaning up some former businesses' wastes. Also, it has been shown that fully one-third of sites pose no risk whatsoever to human health and safety unless residential housing is built -- and children eat the dirt. Thus, the standards often are inapplicable to inner-city industrial zones. The law should be reformed to speed cleanups by eliminating the barriers created by the current liability scheme, setting standards according to the real risks posed by the sites, and vigorously attacking wastes posing serious risks. Money should go to cleanup, not lawyers' pockets. This not only would protect poor people better and sooner, but also would allow inner cities to prosper again.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<p>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If lawmakers were seriously to consider which environmental policies actually save the most lives, they would scrap many costly rules and use the freed-up resources in other ways that save more lives. This commonsense approach would lead to levels and types of regulation that are very different from those which burden America today. In many cases, if the private resources used to comply with federal mandates were to be left in the industries concerned, or used in other ways in the local economy, Americans actually would benefit more, and far more lives could be saved, as the following <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/tp16c1.gif">chart</a> illustrates:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is why it is essential for policymakers to develop a priority list of environmental problems, based on the extent of the possible harm each appears to pose and the cost of reducing that harm to acceptable levels. Such a list would enable policymakers to know just how much risk protection is being bought for every dollar spent, and Americans to receive the maximum environmental "bang for the buck."  Conversely, the federal government could achieve environmental objectives at the lowest cost, and thus with the fewest "pink slips" for American workers.
<p>
<b>STATES ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In thinking of the environment, conservatives should adopt the environmentalists' slogan: "Think globally, act locally."  There is no clearer statement of the need for greater local involvement in protecting the public safety and managing natural resources. While the federal government may serve a valuable role as technical advisor, especially to less populated or less sophisticated states, the states themselves are in the best position to know the needs of their citizens.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Localities form the front line in protecting public safety and should be given greater deference in prioritizing what public-sector actions will best protect the public. Communities then could redirect their attention to the most important problems, thereby protecting public safety and the environment more effectively.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Liberals like to argue that the states, if unsupervised, would ignore the health and welfare of their citizens. Nothing could be further from the truth. Experience has shown that those lawmakers and government officials closest to the people are the most responsive to the people. Conservatives should point out that federal regulators in Washington, D.C., because they are removed from the consequences of their decisions, respond more to national political pressures than to the needs and concerns of those who should count -- individuals and businesses facing the environmental and financial consequences of regulatory decisions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives also must make it clear that in a time of budget constraints and the growing imperative to balance the budget, it simply makes no sense to spend federal money to combat exclusively local problems. States should begin to shoulder their share of the burden. Quite simply, there is no reason for taxpayers in California to pay for environmental problems in Montana, or vice versa. For instance, since hazardous waste sites by their nature are confined to very small areas, it makes sense for states to finance cleanups of "orphan" sites within their borders where no responsible party can be found.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives must begin to rethink environmental issues. They have lost the debate for decades because they have ignored the simple lesson that conservation is a conservative ethic. This ethic -- which at its core is simply freedom with responsibility -- is pursued by conservatives in economic policy and should be pursued in environmental policy as well. If conservatives are to win the debate on this issue, they must acknowledge that all Americans want an environment that is clean and healthy. It is something to which all Americans are entitled. But they are equally entitled to jobs and a high standard of living. In short, they are entitled to a higher overall quality of life. Environmental protection is not the enemy of economic freedom or of a strong and thriving economy. The issue is how best to realize as much of all three as possible.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives must tell the American people the truth about the failure of current environmental policy. There are numerous "horror stories" to illustrate how our policies are destroying lives and squandering scarce labor and natural resources on nonsensical or counterproductive mandates. But conservatives must be careful to articulate the positive message as well. Only this message will lead to both public trust and the needed mandate for change.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives also must explain how their policies can better protect the environment and lives. Whenever possible, they should explain that by refusing to prioritize risks when regulating, federal agencies systematically condemn thousands of Americans to death each year. In an era of limited fiscal resources, refusing either to get the "biggest environmental bang for the buck" or to save as many lives as possible for the money being spent is irresponsible and reckless.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The market is the best conservation tool available. By tapping into the powerful forces and positive incentives of the market and property ownership -- incentives that reward responsible behavior -- Americans can protect the environment more effectively while simultaneously increasing economic freedom and growth. Once the public understands that a conservative also can be an environmentalist, the debate will be won.

<h3> HOW TO TALK ABOUT PROPERTY RIGHTS:<br>
WHY PROTECTING PROPERTY RIGHTS BENEFITS ALL AMERICANS </h3>
By John Shanahan<br>
Policy Analyst
<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Talking Points No. 15<br>
June 19, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The federal government increasingly passes the costs of its policies on to private property owners. To protect species under the Endangered Species Act, to preserve wetlands under the Clean Water Act,<sup>1</sup> or to effect some other such goal, the government typically prohibits or constrains property owners from using their property as they wish-- for example, by forbidding them to build on their land. And when the government wants to build a new federal facility, the property owner can be forced to surrender title through eminent domain. To be sure, when the government wants to take privately held property for its own purposes, it has the power under the Constitution to force a sale of the property. But in these cases, it at least has to pay the owners just compensation for their property. The problem is that when government regulates how private owners may use their land, it typically does so without any recognition of, or compensation for, the costs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This  <I>de facto</I> taking of property-- the practice of restricting a person's right to use his property without compensating him for losses caused by the restriction -- is now being questioned. Under this type of regulatory taking, property owners can face heavy financial burdens or even have their entire life savings wiped out.<sup>2</sup>  For example:<ul>

<p><li>John Sabanovich, an elderly man from Reading, California, saw his net worth plummet from $900,000 to $3,000 after being successfully sued in March 1996 for the purchase price of land he had sold: land that subsequently had been designated a wetland.<sup>3</sup>

<p><li>Bob and Mary McMackin of Arrowhead Lakes, Pennsylvania, built their retirement home and planted trees and shrubbery on dry land in 1989 after obtaining all necessary permits. But the couple were threatened by the Army Corps of Engineers four years later with $50,000 daily fines unless they quickly dug up their entire yard and created a wetland surrounding the house --just five feet away from the structure  --thus threatening the house's structural integrity. They were instructed to do this to restore the site to wetland status, and also to create another wetland off-site two times the size of the house to mitigate the lost wetland area on which the house sat. No one, including the government authorities who issued the various permits, had informed the McMackins that a wetland permit might be necessary for dry land.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the belief of most Americans that seizing people's property by regulation without compensating them is inherently unfair and somehow un-American, few people -- including policymakers -- understand why protecting property rights is so essential.<sup>4</sup>  This is why Congress has yet to complete serious action to stop federal regulators from forcing individuals to surrender their property rights without compensation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Numerous bills have been introduced in the 104th Congress to address this problem, but none has become law. In March 1995, the House passed H.R. 925, the Private Property Protection Act of 1995. Introduced by Representative Charles Canady (R-FL), and part of the Contract with America, the bill as passed would require compensation by the regulating federal agency whenever regulatory restriction of property rights under the Endangered Species Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act exceeds 20 percent of the value of the regulated parcel. It also would allow the owner the option of requiring the federal government to purchase the entire parcel whenever governmental restrictions cause more than a 50 percent reduction in the value of the land -- in short, when the government's interest in the property exceeds the owner's -- and would establish procedures for resolving disputes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Senate has not acted on H.R. 925, but is considering the Omnibus Property Rights Act of 1995 (S. 605), also introduced in March 1995 by then-Senator Robert Dole (R-KS).<sup>5</sup>  S. 605 would require compensation by federal regulating agencies whenever the taking of some "portion" of property diminishes the value by 33 percent. The Senate bill also would establish voluntary alternative dispute resolution, would require a takings impact analysis, and would establish certain administrative rights for property owners under the Endangered Species Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Majority Leader Trent Lott's (R-MS) office has indicated plans to bring the bill to the floor for a vote this legislative session.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While lower percentage thresholds are preferable because more property owners will be provided relief, the difference in devaluation levels before compensation is required is not the most significant distinction between the House and Senate bills. More significant is that the Senate bill is more expansive in holding regulators accountable for their actions -- for example, by requiring that they assess the monetary impact to property owners of regulatory takings. Moreover, it uses a more expansive definition of property, including protection of contract rights, than the House version. The scope and focus of the Senate bill would be clarified if this definition were narrowed -- perhaps to real property, fixtures, and water rights.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite Senator Dole's departure, property rights legislation should not be shelved in the Senate this year. Property owners deserve protection from federal bureaucrats who increasingly resort to these regulations to take control of private property without regard to the burden imposed on American citizens and families.<sup>6</sup>
<p>

<b>THE IMPERATIVE OF PROPERTY PROTECTION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are important constitutional, economic, and fairness reasons for protecting private property rights. To understand why legislative protection is necessary, one must understand why property rights exist.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The U.S. Constitution recognizes the importance of property rights.</b><sup>7</sup> The Fifth Amendment implicitly recognizes that the federal government may take property for public use. In fact, the implicit power of government to take property -- known as eminent domain -- was recognized by the Supreme Court as early as 1795 in <I>Vanhorne's Lessee v. Dorrance,</I> in which the Court found that "the despotic power, as it has been aptly called by some writers, of taking private property, when state necessity requires it, exists in every government.... [G]overnment could not subsist without it."<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Fifth Amendment, however, explicitly mandates that government must pay the property owner for the land confiscated. Although the government may take private property for public use, the clause "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation," ensures that the cost is borne by those who benefit -- the public -- and not by the citizen unfortunate enough to own the land the government requires. The Constitution does not balance the importance of such governmental action against the importance of compensating individuals. The right to compensation is absolute. Thus, balance is built into the system: The government is permitted to take property unilaterally for public use, but at the same time is required to pay for it and protect private owners from having to bear the financial burden of pursuing that new use. In its most basic sense, compensation is a fairness issue. Why should one American bear the entire burden of the government's pursuit of a national good?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Just compensation for regulatory takings preserves individual civil rights.</b> Having seen the detrimental effects of King George's policies, the founders understood that property rights are essential to preventing the usurpation of other rights under the Constitution. It is this relationship to which Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart was referring in <I>Lynch v. Household Finance Co. Inc.</I> when he stated that there is a "fundamental interdependence... between the personal right to liberty and the personal right to property."<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Practically speaking, governments can control a wide range of individual activity if they can control whether individuals remain financially secure or surrender their property. Thus, the majority truly can tyrannize a disfavored minority. As James Madison wrote in Federalist 10, "[pure] democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been incompatible with personal security or the rights of property."  It was the desire to restrict just such tyranny over individuals that motivated the framers to put severe limits -- like the requirement of just compensation -- on the unchecked will of the majority.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Property protection reduces the incentive for the federal government to confiscate property.</b> If property is to be put to its best and most highly valued use, it must be owned by individuals who appreciate its fair market value. The nation's founders well understood the positive economic consequences of protecting owners' investments in their property.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If government had a free hand to take property without payment, the incentive to confiscate property that conferred only a small public benefit would be overwhelming. In fact, that is exactly what has happened. The federal government now owns 30 percent of America's land, with even higher percentages in the West (for instance, 61 percent of Idaho), and is using regulatory takings with increasing frequency to enhance its effective control over even more extensive tracts. The rationale: The cost to the government of compensating owners of the land would be too high. The problem with this approach is that the potential for relatively small public benefits through regulatory takings can lead to ruinous costs to private owners, who must shoulder costs the government deems too steep for itself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reality, federal enforcement officials have found that they can use regulations to gain control of property while circumventing the just compensation requirements of the Constitution. Federal property rights legislation thus is needed to provide a standard that will force federal regulators to consider the costs and benefits of taking private property. When the government decides it is in the public interest to constrain the use of private property for the public good, compensating the property owner at least ensures that the cost of providing the public good is spread fairly across all taxpayers and not just a few unfortunate individuals.
<p>

<b>THE NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE PROTECTION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Supreme Court has been clear in requiring federal, state, and local governments to pay just compensation whenever they take or occupy land or real estate.<sup>10</sup>  Essentially, the Court has held that, even if just a square foot of land is taken and less than one percent of the value is lost, a taking has occurred and just compensation is required.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, the Court's decisions regarding regulatory takings have been less clear and consistent, leaving executive branch agencies with wide latitude in decisions regarding the enforcement and interpretation of laws. Thus, the federal government can take property through regulations in most cases without payment. Legislative protection is therefore necessary, both as a philosophical and as a practical matter. Only then can property owners be secure in the knowledge their rights will be respected, and able to invest their savings accordingly.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although the United States was founded on the principle that government should not be allowed unfettered power to impose its will on law-abiding citizens or seize their property, federal agencies have found a loophole that allows them to usurp property through regulation. These regulatory takings can strip any American of the right to use his land as he wishes. In some cases, they even can almost wipe out the value of that land -- and with it, the life savings of individual citizens.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In light of the ambiguous and limited nature of existing protections against uncompensated regulatory takings, compounded by the increasing tendency of bureaucrats to use this ill-considered and unwise approach, legislative action is necessary to ensure that private property rights are fully protected.

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	On January 20, 1993, Bill Clinton raised his right hand and took an oath before God and the American people that he would "preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States." Now, as the next presidential election approaches, the American people are entitled to know whether he has kept his vow. Specifically, they are entitled to know something about the records being compiled in office by the men and women to whom President Clinton has granted lifetime appointments on the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts. Are Bill Clinton's judges mostly effective defenders of the Constitution, or are they legal realists who feel free to rewrite the Constitution? Are they moderate New Democrats committed to enforcing the law, or are they left-wing "political hangers-on" with a radical and unpopular agenda for social change?	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To ask these questions is <i>not</i> to challenge judicial independence nor even the fundamental decency, on a personal level, of many of the Clinton judicial appointees. The decision that faces the American people is not whether Bill Clinton's judges should be impeached, or whether he should call on some of them to resign, or whether they should have been confirmed in the first place, or whether they are nice people or smart lawyers. The question is, "Given the president's record so far, can we expect a federal judiciary shaped by Bill Clinton to respect the Constitution and honor its role as the interpreter, and not the maker, of our laws?"<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There are two major problems with Bill Clinton's judges. First, they have been unwilling to follow the Constitution in a number of very important cases. And, second, when they choose not to follow the Constitution, they have all too often replaced it with radical and unpopular left-wing social policy. In area after area, Bill Clinton's justices and judges are compiling a public "policy" record that is far to the left of the president's own public statements on similar issues. Bill Clinton may present himself to the public as a mainstream moderate, but his likable justices and judges are working quietly to impose a radical McGovernite legislative agenda on the country.
<p>

<font size="+2"><EM>Many Clinton judges have replaced the Constitution<br>

<hr width=75% size=3>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Bill Clinton's judicial appointments have had their biggest impact to date on the U.S. Supreme Court. With only two appointees, he has succeeded in transforming a moderately conservative Court into one that is (at best) one vote away from being an engine of radical left-wing social change. His justices are the political heirs of William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, and they have gotten the better of the lightweight Republican justices imposed on Presidents Reagan and Bush by a Democratic Senate (and by liberal Republicans) after the 1987 nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork was viciously defeated. Many conservatives don't realize just how liberal Bill Clinton's two affable Ivy League justices really are. In part, this is because Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer are exceptionally bright and likable people. Nevertheless, in case after case they have voted for Big Government, against federalism, for a radical secular humanism that hates religion, against traditional social values, for the "rights" of pornographers and drug dealers, against private property, for racial quotas and preferences, and against the creation of a truly colorblind America.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The two Clinton justices depart from the William J. Brennan model of liberal judicial activism in only two significant ways: first, they write (or join) opinions that are more cagey and politically astute than blunderbuss opinions such as <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. As a result, the public is unaware of the extent to which radical left-wing policy ideas are seeping into our court opinions. Second, they do not oppose the death penalty across the board, although to some extent they resist its implementation. In every other important respect, the two Clinton justices are the children of the Warren Court, far-left ACLU judicial activists intent on writing their own radical and elite prejudices into the Constitution.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Many of Bill Clinton's lower-court judges (though not all) are equally or even more left-wing, but they have been unable so far to have much of an impact, both because they remain outnumbered and because the Reagan-Bush judges on the lower courts have turned out better in most parts of the country than have their brethren on the Supreme Court. If Bill Clinton wins a second term, however, this will change. In less than four years, he has filled about 25 percent of the seats on the federal judiciary. If re-elected to another term, he will have a chance to replace hundreds more retiring judges, and many of the federal courts of appeals will flip from Reagan-Bush to Clinton-Carter majorities. And depending on how lucky he gets, he will almost certainly name another one to three left-wing Supreme Court justices. This means that the few 5 to 4 wins that conservatives have managed recently will all become losses.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's look at what Bill Clinton's America will then be like, and contrast it with the America he claims to want. A good way to do this is to compare the specific policies Bill Clinton says he favors with the left-wing social policies that his judges are legislating from the bench. In doing this, we should remember that not all the Reagan-Bush appointments have turned out well, nor have all of Bill Clinton's judges turned out badly. Nonetheless, the overall pattern is quite clear.<p><b>Limited Government</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<i>	"The era of big government is over" (January 23, 1996).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Or so Bill Clinton said in his last State of the Union address. Unfortunately, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer certainly have not yet been let in on the secret. Both have voted in favor of every single claim of national governmental power yet to come before them. Only a year ago, in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1456.ZO.filt"><i>U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton</i></a>, both Clinton justices were members of a 5 to 4 majority on the Court that struck down state-imposed term limits on Members of the U.S. Congress. As a result, the term-limit laws of 22 states, 21 of which had been adopted by the voters directly in initiatives or referenda, were declared invalid. The Clinton Justice Department filed an unusual "friend of the Court" brief to encourage this result. The fact of the matter is that Bill Clinton's Supreme Court justices killed the term-limits movement: had <i>either</i> of the two Clinton justices joined Justice Clarence Thomas's elegant and brilliant dissent, we would have term limits in most of the United States today.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These votes were not anomalies. In <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1260.ZO.filt"><i>United States v. Lopez</i></a>, both Clinton justices again voted for the position that the national government has unlimited power to regulate <i>all</i> aspects of the nation's economic, social, and cultural life. Justice Breyer wrote the main dissent for four of the nine justices and was joined by Justice Ginsburg. He paid only lip service to the idea that the U.S. Constitution limits the power of the national government in any way whatsoever. Under Justice Breyer's interpretation of the Commerce Clause, the federal government could nationalize education curricula, local law enforcement, family law, and everything else under the sun, so long as Congress could rationally think that doing so would in some attenuated way be connected to interstate commerce. Justices Breyer and Ginsburg clearly believe that the Big Government of the Great Society and the New Deal can do anything it wants to, so long as it does not violate the Bill of Rights or its "emanations and penumbras."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This past March, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer were again on the wrong side of an important federalism case. In <i>Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida</i>, they joined a strident dissent written by Justice David Souter that argued for overturning a 200-year-old understanding that state governments are protected from lawsuits in federal court by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Casting aside years of settled understanding, Justice Souter argued that Congress should be able to authorize citizens to sue state governments without their consent -- a theory that reduces the states from a position of co-sovereignty to one of abject subordination. Chief Justice William Rehnquist won the 5 to 4 vote in <i>Seminole Tribe</i> with no margin to spare, and the dissenters promised in their opinions to try to overrule the case at the first opportunity.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Big Government activism of the Clinton justices also manifests itself in "separation of powers" cases since that doctrine, like the doctrine of federalism, is for them an inconvenient restraint on the unlimited power of the national government. Justice Ginsburg was one of only two dissenters in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1121.ZO.filt"><i>Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc.</i></a>, an important case that limited Congress's power to retroactively command the federal courts to reopen final judgments in private civil actions already decided. Justice Breyer weighed in with a tepid separate concurrence in the case rather than join Justice Antonin Scalia's forceful majority opinion.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Clinton justices are completely unwilling to enforce the Framers' written Constitution of limited powers, federalism, and checks and balances. Their idea of constitutional law begins and largely ends with a judicially dictated jurisprudence of unenumerated rights. Even the constitutionally enumerated right that protects private property from being taken without just compensation is given short shrift: Justice Ginsburg, for example, joined three other justices in dissenting from Chief Justice Rehnquist's important opinion in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-518.ZO.filt"><i>Dolan v. City of Tigard</i></a>, which protected private property from confiscation by regulation. In that case, a municipal government was ultimately rebuffed in its attempt to force a shop owner to set aside 15 percent of her land as a public easement as a condition of receiving a building permit. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer also dissented in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1823.ZO.filt"><i>Missouri v. Jenkins</i></a>, the Kansas City school-desegregation case. In that case, they joined an opinion that took the extraordinary position that federal judges can require local governments to raise taxes in order to fund remedial education and magnet schools.<p><b>Religious Freedoms</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<i>	"[The First Amendment] does not convert our schools into religion-free zones. . . . I am deeply troubled that so many Americans feel that their faith is threatened. . . . When the First Amendment is invoked as an obstacle to private expression of religion, it is being misused. . . . Religion has a proper place in private and a proper place in public, because the public square belongs to all Americans" (July 12, 1995).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Or so said Bill Clinton in a widely reported speech at a suburban Washington, D.C.-area high school. It went unremarked at the time, however, that his two Supreme Court appointees had recently voted in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-329.ZO.filt"><i>Rosenberger v. University of Virginia</i></a> to maintain our schools as religion-free zones. The issue in <i>Rosenberger</i> was whether a student activities fund, which was used to support various publications by student groups, could also be used to pay for the printing costs of <i>Wide Awake</i>, a Christian student newspaper. By a vote of 5 to 4, the Court said yes, over the dissenting votes of Justices Breyer and Ginsburg.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The opinion that they joined was a militantly secular tirade against any role for religion in any public institution. It reasoned that not a penny of public money can ever be spent on anything religious, even though public money is routinely spent in huge quantities on educational programs hostile to religion or to religiously inspired moral values. Under the ahistorical rhetoric of the dissenters in <i>Rosenberger</i>, it is hard to see how the courts could ever uphold government chaplains, Thanksgiving Day holidays, mottoes on our currency, school vouchers, or even tax deductions for religious organizations. The <i>Rosenberger</i> dissent theorizes that no government aid can ever go to any religious organization, even if the aid is equally available to comparable secular organizations.<blockquote><p>

<i>	"I personally did not believe that it was coercive to have a prayer at an outdoor sporting event or at a graduation event because I don't believe that it is coercive to people who don't participate in it" (November 14, 1994).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A nice sentiment, but one that is unfortunately not shared by Judges Theodore McKee and H. Lee Sarokin, Bill Clinton's two appointees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In fact, Judge McKee wrote the <i>en banc</i> opinion for the Third Circuit in <i>ACLU and Edward Ross v. Black Horse Pike Regional Board of Education</i>, a decision that banned student-led graduation prayers throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Judge McKee's radical opinion went further than the U.S. Supreme Court has ever gone in this area by outlawing student-led graduation prayers as well as prayers organized directly by a school principal. In order to do this, Judge McKee had to reject a directly "on point" holding of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which had upheld student-led graduation prayers in <i>Jones v. Clear Creek Independent School District</i>. Four Reagan-Bush judges dissented from Judge McKee's opinion, while every Democratic appointee on the Third Circuit joined it. Judge McKee's pro-ACLU advocacy was so effective with his colleagues that he even brought a number of the feebler Reagan-Bush appointees along with him. Bill Clinton's hopes that we could have graduation prayer were dashed by his own appointee. Now, to determine what our national policy will be on this issue, an increasingly anti-religious Supreme Court will soon be obliged to hear and resolve the conflict that Judge McKee has created between the Third and Fifth Circuits on this issue.<p><b>Racial Quotas and Preferences</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<i>"I say to you, I'm against quotas. I'm against discrimination" (September 21, 1995). "Today, I am directing all our agencies to comply with the Supreme Court's Adarand decision, and also to apply the four standards of fairness to all our affirmative-action programs that I have already articulated--no quotas in theory or practice; no illegal discrimination of any kind, including reverse discrimination; no preference for people who are not qualified for any job or opportunity; and as soon as a program has succeeded, it must be retired. Any program that doesn't meet these four principles must be eliminated or reformed to meet them" (July 19, 1995).</i></blockquote><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Great rhetoric but, unfortunately, there are two Clinton appointees who will not be complying with the Supreme Court's 5 to 4 decision in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-1841.ZO.filt"><i>Adarand</i></a> outlawing quotas in federal programs. Yes, that's right -- Justices Breyer and Ginsburg both dissented in that case, and Justice Ginsburg actually wrote one of the dissenting opinions. She tried to put a pro-racial-preference spin on Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's plurality opinion, and said she saw "today's opinion as one that allows our precedent to evolve, still to be informed by and responsive to changing conditions." Translated into everyday English, Justice Ginsburg hopes to distinguish or overrule <i>Adarand</i> at the first opportunity.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And what, you may wonder, ws the "moderate" federal affirmative-action program in <i>Adarand</i> that Justices Ginsburg and Breyer were so eager to uphold? It was an explicit racial-preference program for government highway subcontractors, a preference so blatant that even many who support affirmative-action recruitment efforts in universities have condemned programs like this one. Justice Ginsburg was so enthusiastic about this particular program that she not only authored a dissenting opinion herself but also joined <i>two</i> other dissenting opinions: one by Justice Souter and another, even more radical, opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens. Justice Ginsburg was the only other member of the Court to join Justice Stevens's opinion, which would appear to uphold all federal racial-preference programs of any kind that are, in his opinion, well motivated.
<p>

<hr width=80% size=3>
<font size="+2"><EM>Justices Breyer and Ginsburg have voted to uphold every <br>racial preference or quota that has come before them</EM></font><hr width=80% size=3></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justices Ginsburg and Breyer's votes on the racial preference/quota issue in <i>Adarand</i> were not at all idiosyncratic. Rather, they form part of a pattern in which both justices have voted to uphold every racial preference or quota that has ever come before them. In particular, they have dissented in every voting-rights case involving challenges to political redistricting, decisions in which race played the predominant role. This past year, they joined the minority in the 5 to 4 decisions in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-923.ZO.filt"><i>Shaw v. Hunt</i></a> and <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-805.ZO.filt"><i>Bush v. Vera</i></a>, in which the Court threw out racially gerrymandered congressional districts in North Carolina and Texas. Last year, Justice Ginsburg wrote the dissent for four justices (including Justice Breyer) in the companion cases of <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-631.ZO.filt"><i>Miller v. Johnson</i></a> and <i>United States v. Hayes</i>, in which the Court invalidated racial gerrymanders in Louisiana and Georgia.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The issue in these cases is whether it is unconstitutional to create wildly odd-shaped legislative districts for the purpose of maximizing the proportion of voters of a particular race, when such districts violate traditional districting standards of compactness and affinity of community interests. The purpose of this whole enterprise is to use federal voting-rights law to allocate congressional seats by race, so that every racial and ethnic group in the nation is proportionately represented according to their numbers in the population at large. While greater minority representation in public life is to be desired, this particular quota regime is in fact a stealthy imposition of the system of proportional representation used in places like Israel, Japan, Russia, and Germany (under the Weimar Republic). Everyone familiar with the unstable politics of those countries knows that this kind of rigid proportional representation is disastrous for social peace, because it rewards extremists and penalizes consensus building. For this reason, many have long thought that the Anglo-American tradition of allocating electoral districts geographically is better than the Continental European tradition of proportional representation. <p>
<center><hr width=80% size=3>
<font size="+2"><EM>The Ginsburg-Breyer view of racial gerrymandering<br> would

<hr width=80% size=3></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Ginsburg-Breyer view of racial gerrymandering would authorize nothing less than a racial quota system for Congress. By enshrining a system of racial and ethnic proportional representation, it would also codify a political system of racial spoils and push us toward the unstable electoral system that has been the bane of Continental European democracies. 

<p><b>Crime</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <i>	"The United States cannot tolerate the rates of crime and violence which have come to be almost commonplace in the last several years. We have to intensify our efforts to reduce crime" (July 28, 1996).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Few issues are of greater concern to most Americans than the fight against violent street crime and illegal drugs, and, as is well-known, Bill Clinton loves to boast that his administration has been tough on crime and on punishing criminals. Once again, however, his judicial appointees often seem to be seriously "off message" when criminal-law cases are before the courts. In its most recent term, the Supreme Court decided <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-1511.ZO.filt"><i>Lewis v. Casey</i></a>, a major case bearing on the right of prisoners to enjoy free prison libraries and legal assistance. The case involved how broadly to read an activist opinion from the 1970s by the late Justice Thurgood Marshall, which requires state taxpayers to subsidize frivolous prison litigation by providing free legal help and library facilities. In this particular case, a federal court in Arizona issued sweeping orders to state prison officials to address the complaints of state prisoners about the quality of their legal research materials.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justice Scalia, writing for five Reagan-Bush justices, seized on the case as a chance to cut back on Thurgood Marshall's requirement that state governments subsidize prisoner lawsuits. Scalia argued that the federal courts had no business trying to run state prisons, and he set some common-sense limits on the bad precedent by making it inapplicable when prisoners' claims were frivolous or when prisoners were trying to bring legal action irrelevant to sentences and terms of confinement. Justice Thomas, in a brilliant concurrence, even called on the Court to overrule its offensive and nonsensical precedent. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, however, chose to dissent from most of Justice Scalia's opinion. They joined a handwringing, meandering dissent that complained that Scalia was going too far and too fast in protecting state prison authorities and taxpayers from the desire of prisoners for good libraries.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This same term, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer also joined a sweeping opinion by Justice Stevens in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/95-266.ZO.filt"><i>Jaffee v. Redmond</i></a> that recognized a disturbing new rule that could keep vital evidence of wrong behavior from being used in federal court for either civil or criminal trials. In that case, the Court held that conversations between a patient and her psychiatrist <i>or social worker</i> are protected from compelled disclosure during the course of a federal criminal or civil trial. The Court's decision to exclude a sweeping new category of evidence in this case is disturbingly reminiscent of the Warren Court's great exclusionary-rule blunders in the 1960s. Every time evidence is excluded from the courtroom, the task of proving the guilt (or innocence) of the culpable becomes more difficult. To impose this burden upon prosecutors in order to protect communications not only with psychiatrists but also with social workers is sheer folly. As Justice Scalia noted in his dissent, we don't allow a testimonial privilege in federal court for conversations with parents, siblings, children, or bartenders. Why on earth would we carve out such a privilege for social workers? Sadly, the case was lost by a vote of 7 to 2.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justice Breyer cast two other noteworthy votes in criminal cases this term. First, he joined two separate opinions in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/95-8836.ZO.filt"><i>Felker v. Turpin</i></a> that sought to water down the new federal law for expediting the application of the death penalty. Second, he joined the dissent in an important 5 to 4 decision on whether police can apply a property seizure law designed to discourage prostitution. Had the dissenters' view prevailed, the customers of prostitutes would have been able to protect their cars from confiscation by co-registering them with the very wives they were betraying.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There are countless lower-court criminal-law opinions by Clinton appointees that are deeply disturbing. To mention just one example, consider <i>United States v. Hamrick</i>, decided by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, where Clinton appointee M. Blane Michael joined a dissent that would have exonerated a defendant who had mailed a bomb to the U.S. Attorney who had prosecuted him. Judge Michael was of the view that the bomb was not a "deadly weapon" within the meaning of the federal criminal law, because it was badly made and didn't cause too much damage when it exploded!<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As these examples illustrate, this administration is appointing some disturbingly fuzzy minds to the federal bench. Once again Bill Clinton's tough talk on crime is revealed to be nothing more than talk. His judges are rapidly bringing us back to the bad old days of 1960s Warren Court liberalism.<p><b>Mainstream Values</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>
	"When I sought the presidency, I said that I wanted . . . to put mainstream values back at the heart of social policy. . . . [W]e're moving in the right direction to reassert and reinsert into American life mainstream values. And, I believe the initiatives of our Administration have played a role in that" (October 13, 1995). "I know not everybody's going to be in a stable, traditional family like you see in one of those 1950s sitcoms, but we'd be better off if more people were" (September 9, 1994).</i></blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Mainstream values? Stable traditional families? So far, Bill Clinton's justices and judges have voted to: strike down his own liberalized policy on "gays in the military" as unconstitutional; require that gays be given special rights under certain state and local civil rights laws, thus forcing private landlords, elementary-school boards, and employers to associate with militant gays even if they don't want to; oppose an important Utah statute that regulates abortions <i>after 20 weeks</i>; and, incorporate a particularly strident and unreasonable version of the failed Equal Rights Amendment into the federal Constitution. And, they have managed to do all of this in just the last two years!<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's take these "mainstream values" judicial opinions one at a time. As is well known, Bill Clinton shot himself in the foot shortly after he was elected by attempting to change the U.S. military's long-standing policy of refusing to allow homosexuals to serve in the military. After an enormous public uproar, he was forced to back down by moderate liberals like Senator Sam Nunn and Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In November 1993, he signed a statute creating a new "don't ask, don't tell" compromise policy; it was designed to quell public outrage by keeping outspoken gay individuals out of the armed forces, while making clear that the military should not pursue the expulsion of gays who did not commit homosexual acts and who did not discuss their private sexual activities and inclinations.<p>
<p>
<center><hr width=90% size=3>
<font size="+2"><EM>A constitutional right for homosexuals to marry, adopt <br>children, or teach in grade school may be just around the corner</EM></font><hr width=90% size=3></center> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Since then two federal courts of appeal have heard cases on this issue. In <i>Stefan v. Perry</i>, the D.C. Circuit voted 6 to 4 that the long-standing pre-1993 policy of excluding homosexuals from the military did not violate the Constitution. Bill Clinton's sole appointee, Judge Judith Rogers, voted to invalidate the policy, as did all the Carter appointees. All of the Reagan-Bush appointees voted to uphold the policy. On April 5, 1996, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit voted 9 to 4 to uphold the constitutionality of Bill Clinton's own "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Amazingly, <i>both</i> of Bill Clinton's appointees to that Court, Judges M. Blane Michael and Diana Motz, voted to strike down his own quite liberal policy as unconstitutional.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But Judges Rogers, Michael, and Motz are by no means out of step for the Clinton judiciary on these matters. Last May, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer joined a 6 to 3 majority in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-1039.ZO.filt"><i>Romer v. Evans</i></a>. In that case, gay-rights groups had challenged a ballot initiative passed by Colorado voters that overrode all attempts by Colorado towns to enact special civil-rights protections for gays. Had the two Clinton justices joined the three dissenters in that case, Colorado's policy of legalizing homosexuality but not granting it preferential status would still be good law.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some conservatives have been tempted to read the Court's confused opinion in <i>Romer</i>, which Justices Breyer and Ginsburg joined without comment, quite narrowly. This is almost certainly a mistake. The opinion contains opaque references to the illegality of "status discrimination" -- a key issue in the "don't ask, don't tell" cases heard so far by the D.C. Circuit and the Fourth Circuit. If the Court pursues this idea of outlawing "status discrimination," and if it continues to view any failure to treat homosexuals like heterosexuals as being evidence only of "irrational animus," then there is no reason to think that a constitutional right for homosexuals to marry, adopt children, and teach in grade schools is not right around the corner. The Court's meandering opinion and the silence of the five justices who joined it offer no assurance whatsoever that <i>any</i> differential treatment of homosexuality is still allowed. Those conservatives who took comfort in the Court's refusal to say it was applying "strict scrutiny" (the highest level of judicial scrutiny) to classifications based on sexual orientation are being misled. The Court is applying strict scrutiny in this case, without acknowledging candidly that it is doing so.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The "mainstream values" of the Clinton judges don't end with issues bearing on homosexuality. In <i>Leavitt v. Jane L.</i>, the Court voted 5 to 4 to summarily reverse a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit that invalidated those portions of a Utah state law that prohibited abortions after 20 weeks, except where the mother's life or medical health will be seriously threatened or where the child will be born with "grave defects." The case arose because under <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/91-744.ZO.filt"><i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</i></a> (1992), the Utah statute was unconstitutional insofar as it prohibited abortions before the fetus is "viable" outside the womb.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Utah law, however, clearly provided for the "severability" of its other provisions in the event that one part of the law was ruled unconstitutional. The Tenth Circuit had willfully refused to sever the statute so that abortions after 20 weeks could be regulated. Five Justices joined a rare, short <i>per curiam</i> opinion summarily reversing this as blatant error. This short opinion reflected nothing more than the long-settled idea that even after <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the states can still regulate third-trimester, "post-viability" abortions so long as no "undue burden" is placed upon the mother's right to protect her own life or health. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, however, dissented. They claimed variously that the Court should defer here to the Tenth Circuit, that summary reversal should be used rarely, and (implicitly) that the issue was not important enough to merit a grant of <i>certiorari</i> and a summary reversal. Do they intend in a Clinton second term to try to extend the near-total right to abortion in Roe to third-trimester abortions or to infanticide? Why would anyone with "mainstream values" join an angry four-justice dissent in an easy severability case like this?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Then, of course, there is the Court's "mainstream" opinion by Justice Ginsburg in <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/94-1941.ZO.filt"><i>United States v. Virginia</i></a> where the Court held that the Virginia Military Institute, an all-male military academy funded by the state of Virginia, could not constitutionally exclude women. This case is remarkable less for its invalidation of the all-male program at VMI than for its writing into the Constitution a particularly extreme version of the Equal Rights Amendment -- which had failed to win popular support and passage through legitimate channels in the 1970s and early 1980s. 
<p><center>
<hr width=85% size=3><font size="+2"><em>Single-sex combat units, draft registration, football<br>
teams, and private schools may now be unconstitutional</em></font>
<hr width=85% size=3></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Justice Ginsburg wielded the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection clause to create a new standard of strict scrutiny for gender classifications, while using a milder label that minimizes the political fallout for liberals in the White House and in Congress. Henceforth, says Justice Ginsburg, gender classifications require "an exceedingly persuasive justification" and are subject to "skeptical scrutiny." They may not be used to do anything that <i>in the view of the justices</i> "creates or perpetuates the legal, social, or economic inferiority of women" nor may they rely on anything that <i>in the view of the justices</i> involves an "overbroad generalization about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of men and women." Thus if American society thinks that single-sex draft registration or combat rules are desirable, it is going to have to say something "exceedingly persuasive" to a "skeptical" Justice Ginsburg. If American society wants single-sex sports teams at its state schools, it must have something "exceedingly persuasive" to say to a "skeptical" Justice Ginsburg. If American society wants to offer charitable tax-exempt status to a private women's college or to a Roman Catholic Church priesthood, it is going to have to say something "exceedingly persuasive" to a "skeptical" Justice Ginsburg.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As Chief Justice Rehnquist (in his concurrence) and Justice Scalia (in his dissent) both pointed out, this anti-democratic, elitist nonsense has nothing at all to do with the very important subject of the equal rights of women. Justice Ginsburg made no effort in her opinion to explain why she thought VMI was unconstitutional while single-sex combat units or football teams were O.K. That is because she is not interested in equal rights for women in the sense that most Americans would understand that term. What Justice Ginsburg wanted to do all along, and did do, in the VMI case was to lay the doctrinal groundwork for a final assault on <i>all</i> remaining classifications and social practices, both public and private, wherein any distinction between men and women is made according to gender. She does not identify a single gender classification or social practice, either public or private, that she is definitively willing to approve. The door is being flung open to a massive judicial assault on our sexist military services, football teams, private single-sex schools, and religious organizations.<p><b>The V-Chip</b><blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>
	"I call on Congress to pass the requirement for a V-chip in TV sets so that parents can screen out programs they believe are inappropriate for their children. When parents control what their children see, that is not censorship. That is enabling parents to assume more personal responsibility for their children's upbringing" (January 23, 1996)</i>.</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Bill Clinton likes to leave voters with the impression that he is concerned about inappropriate television programs aimed at children. Unfortunately, Justice Ginsburg did not agree in the Supreme Court's recent <a href="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/95-124.ZO.filt"><i>Denver Cable</i></a> case. In that case, the law in question sought to modify the public-access policy governing local cable networks that required them to broadcast indecent programming without restrictions. Astonishingly, Justice Ginsburg was one of only two justices on the Court who voted to hold unconstitutional <i>every single restriction</i> before the court that was aimed at suppressing indecent programming available to children watching TV. Justice Breyer's more moderate opinion would uphold a restriction like the V-chip, but not a reasonable requirement that people who want to subscribe to indecent programming must do so by taking some affirmative step to sign up for it. Evidently Justice Breyer is more concerned about the privacy rights of adults who watch indecent programming than about the rights of children who may accidentally see such programming on cable TV.<p>
<center><hr width=65% size=3><font size="+2"><em>The last two years have seen a large number<br> of opinions that are contemptuous of the <br>
values and prerogatives of the American people</em></font>
<hr width=65% size=3></center>  

	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Justices Ginsburg and Breyer's extreme solicitude for the consumers of pornography is shared by both of Bill Clinton's two appointees to the D.C. Circuit. Judges Judith Rogers and David Tatel were on the dissenting side of a 7 to 4 <i>en banc</i> decision that upheld a federal law restricting the broadcast of indecent material to the hours of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. All seven judges in the majority were Reagan-Bush appointees, while all four of the dissenters were appointed by Presidents Clinton or Carter. It is by no means clear to me that this law would survive review on the Supreme Court today, given Justices Ginsburg and Breyer's views on indecency, the First Amendment, and the rights of children.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As I hope I have made clear, the U.S. Supreme Court is now dangerously adrift. The last two years have seen an increasingly large number of opinions that are contemptuous of the beliefs, values, and prerogatives of the American people as well as of the democratic process itself. The Clinton justices have almost always been on the wrong side of these cases, and in many instances they have joined minorities of four in support of propositions that are ludicrous and offensive. Although Justices Souter, Kennedy, and O'Connor deserve some of the blame, the other three Reagan-Bush justices have been stellar. Justices O'Connor and Kennedy have joined those three to produce some very important 5 to 4 victories in fighting off racial quotas, allowing religious speech, curbing Big Government, protecting private property, and fighting crime. If Bill Clinton is re-elected and replaces any of those five justices with another "moderate" like Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, then every single conservative victory of the last 28 years will be at great risk of being overturned. The Warren Court ended when Richard Nixon won the presidential election of 1968; the presidential election of 1996 will determine whether the era that Nixon inaugurated is now to be replaced by a new burst of radical left-wing judging.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But what are we to make of Bill Clinton's role in all of this? Is it remotely plausible to think that he doesn't realize how far to the left his own justices and judges are of his own public statements on issue after issue? No, it is not plausible. Bill Clinton is a former professor of constitutional law, a Rhodes Scholar, and a graduate of Yale Law School. He knows perfectly well the views of the justices and judges he is nominating.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Obviously, these are very difficult times for anyone who believes in a restrained, law-abiding federal judiciary. There is, however, one consoling thought. If Bill Clinton is re-elected, he will have a mandate from the American people to rein in Big Government, protect religious speech, oppose racial preferences, preserve mainstream values, fight indecent television programming aimed at children, and fight crime and drugs. Which jurist could Bill Clinton possibly name to the Supreme Court whom he could count on to do all of the things that he says he wants done? The answer is obvious: renominate Judge Robert H. Bork.<p>

Very soon, both the House of Representatives and the Senate will debate identical versions of the <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.r.03144:">Defend America Act of 1996</a>. The Defend America Act commits the nation to deployment of a national missile defense system by 2003. It is similar to the provision in the FY 1996 defense authorization bill vetoed by President Bill Clinton on December 28, 1995. How Members of Congress vote on this bill will rest primarily on their understanding of the immediacy of the missile threat. Members who see the threat as present and growing will likely vote in favor of the bill; those who see the threat as remote are likely to vote against it.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In November 1995, the U.S. intelligence community issued an intelligence assessment describing the ballistic missile threat to the United States.<sup>1</sup>  Among other things, it concluded that there is little threat of a missile attack on the U.S. during the next 15 years. President Clinton and congressional opponents of the Defend America Act use this assessment to justify their opposition to deploying a national missile defense as soon as possible. Since this assessment is crucial to the coming debate on missile defense, and since the vote on this legislation may well determine the future of U.S. security against missile threats, the assessment deserves thorough analysis.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Normally, it is impossible for the public to pass judgment on the content of intelligence assessments because they are classified. In the case of the intelligence assessment on the missile threat, however, the same summary version that was provided to President Clinton has been published.<sup>2</sup>  Thus, the public has an opportunity to decide whether the assessment is credible.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
An evaluation of this intelligence assessment reveals that it is not credible. In fact, it contains a number of flaws. The authors of the assessment:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Inexplicably discount the threat posed today by long-range missiles in China and  Russia.</b> The intelligence community concluded that the U.S. will not face a missile threat for the next 15 years. But this inexplicably discounts the already existing threat posed by Russia and China. The assumption is that because these countries already have long-range missiles, nothing new will happen in the next 15 years to change the level of the threat. But things can change, and very quickly. This is particularly true regarding the emergence of hostile intent toward the U.S.
<p>
The immediacy of Chinese hostility was revealed earlier this year when Chinese officials were quoted as saying that China could take military action against Taiwan without the U.S. intervening because U.S. leaders "care more about Los Angeles than they do about Taiwan."<sup>3</sup>  This was nothing less than a thinly veiled threat to attack the U.S. with long-range nuclear missiles if it intervened on behalf of Taiwan.
<p>
Another potential nuclear threat is posed by Russia -- as Clinton's Pentagon already has admitted. In fact, the intelligence report's findings on Russia blatantly contradict a fundamental conclusion of the Clinton Administration's own 1994 Nuclear Posture Review, its official statement of nuclear arms policy. This statement recognizes the volatility of the U.S. relationship with Russia.<sup>4</sup>  It even includes an option for "hedging" against a reversal in U.S.-Russian relations by arguing that America may have to exceed limits imposed by arms control agreements with the Russians if Moscow again becomes hostile. Russia is a strategic wild card -- a fact which the authors of this intelligence report blithely ignore. In short, the report's "findings" are fundamentally at odds with the Clinton Administration's own nuclear policy.
<p>
<li><b>Write off Alaska and Hawaii as territory to defend against missile attack.</b> The finding that the U.S. will not face a missile threat for 15 years is based on examining the missile threat to "the contiguous 48 states and Canada."  Alaska and Hawaii are not considered. Why this is done becomes clear when it is revealed that North Korea is developing a missile, the <I>Taepo Dong</I> 2, that could reach Alaska and Hawaii. North Korea could deploy this missile in three to five years. It is truly remarkable that the Clinton Administration appears to believe that the people of Alaska and Hawaii are strategic second-class citizens who deserve less protection than New Yorkers or Californians. It is even more remarkable that the President appears to believe that Canadians deserve more protection than Alaskans and Hawaiians.
<p>
<li><b>Are overly optimistic about how long it will take rogue states to develop long-range missiles.</b> The intelligence estimate states: "We [of the intelligence community] are likely to detect any indigenous long-range missile program many years before deployment."  But the intelligence community has a poor track record in detecting illicit weapons programs. It failed, for example, to detect major portions of Iraq's nuclear weapons program. International inspections of Iraq's nuclear program following the Persian Gulf War revealed that it was far larger and far more advanced than the U.S. intelligence community had predicted before the inspections.<sup>5</sup>  Saddam Hussein was only months away from deploying an explosive nuclear bomb, not years away as the intelligence community had predicted.
<p>
<li><b>Unwisely downplay the potential impact of foreign assistance on the missile threat to America.</b> They conclude that foreign assistance is a "wild card" that could be used by developing countries to accelerate their missile programs. Chinese assistance, for example, reportedly helped Iraq extend the range of their Soviet Scud-B missiles.<sup>6</sup>  The post-Gulf War inspections in Iraq revealed that the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission relied on a wide variety of foreign sources to accelerate its nuclear weapons program. The foreign sources include corporations in the U.S. and Germany. This is one reason why the U.S. was surprised by the scope and advanced state of the Iraqi program. United Nations inspector David Kay commented on October 17, 1991, that "there is no region of the world that you will find that did not contribute to [the Iraqi nuclear weapons] program."<sup>7</sup>
<P>
<li><b>Underestimate the impact of space launch vehicle development on missile proliferation.</b> The intelligence estimate states that "if a country were to purchase an SLV [space launch vehicle], converting it to an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] would involve technological obstacles roughly as challenging as those involved in an indigenous ICBM program."  This statement is surprising since space launch vehicle and missile components are very similar. Of the eight essential components of a ballistic missile, all but one -- the warhead -- are found in somewhat modified forms in space launch vehicles.<sup>8</sup>  Thus, the transfer of space launch vehicle components is virtually certain to assist countries in developing missiles.
<p>
Downplaying the potential impact of widely available space launch vehicle technology on missile development programs reflects the intelligence community's historic tendency to underestimate the pace of technological advancement in foreign weapons programs. Fifty years ago, U.S. intelligence failed to predict Soviet acquisition of atomic bomb technology. The Soviet Union tested its first atomic weapon in August 1949, years earlier than was predicted. America was shocked for a second time in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched its <I>Sputnik</I> satellite. Predicting that a missile threat to America is 15 years away indicates the same sort of complacency that resulted in surprise at the Soviet atomic test in 1949 and <I>Sputnik</I> launch in 1957.
<p>
<lI><b>Are completely unrealistic about the potential sale of long-range missiles and space launch vehicles.</b> The intelligence assessment concludes: "We expect countries that currently have ICBMs will not sell them."  This finding is contradicted by historical experience. China sold intermediate-range missiles to Saudi Arabia in 1988 and Pakistan in 1993. Why the intelligence community is so certain that China would not sell long-range missiles is a complete mystery. Moreover, even the Clinton Administration recognizes that Russia will be marketing its ballistic missiles as space launch vehicles. On September 28, 1995, the Clinton Administration agreed to modify the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) to lift restrictions on converting missiles to space launch vehicles.<sup>9</sup>  It did this to satisfy the Russians, who want to sell modified SS-25 <I>Sickle</I> long-range ballistic missiles as space launch vehicles. In short, the Administration agreed to modify an existing arms control treaty precisely to permit the kind of proliferation which is dismissed so easily in the intelligence estimate, and which it supposedly opposes so vehemently in its declared anti-proliferation policy. Apparently the Russians are beginning to implement this policy. Press reports on a classified Pentagon study reveal that Russia is selling SS-18 <I>Satan</I> ICBM components to the Chinese as space launch vehicle technology.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Inexplicably dismiss the threat of accidental or unauthorized missile launches against the U.S.</b> The intelligence assessment states: "We conclude that the current threat to North America from unauthorized or accidental launch of Russian or Chinese strategic missiles remains remote and has not changed significantly from that of the past decade."  Yet Russia and China are undergoing great political turmoil. Any fracturing of either country's political leadership cannot help but cause a break in the chain of command governing nuclear weapons. This is precisely what happened when an attempted <I>coup d'etat</I> against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev took place in 1991. Nobody knew who had control of the Soviet nuclear arsenal during that time. Such political crises occur frequently, with little or no warning. It is all but impossible to understand why the intelligence community is so confident that the threat of accidental or unauthorized missile launches is so remote.
</ul><p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The intelligence assessment of the missile threat to the United States contains so many flaws, contradictions, and ambiguities that critics naturally wonder about its objectivity. There are deep suspicions in Congress and the expert community that political leaders in the Clinton Administration intervened in the intelligence process to get the answer they wanted. Indeed, the Clinton Administration made a decision in 1993 to cut the national missile defense budget by some 80 percent. The Administration may have felt pressured to justify this decision by encouraging an intelligence assessment that minimized the threat of a missile attack on the U.S. The U.S. General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, is trying to determine whether the Clinton Administration did in fact intervene. If it is found that the Administration "cooked" this assessment, then President Clinton's veto of the FY 1996 defense authorization bill will appear to be not merely an act of willful ignorance, but the <I>coup de grace</I> in a shameless plan of deception.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whether the intelligence assessment is objective or not is now a matter for Congress to decide. However, for purposes of the debate on the Defend America Act, it is enough to know that the possibility exists that this assessment was "cooked," that it is fatally flawed, and that it is therefore a poor guide to policy.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress should not rely on this assessment as an excuse for deferring the decision to deploy a national missile defense system. Further delay in deployment could result in a surprise missile attack against which the U.S. would have no defense, and which could cost many American lives. If this were to occur, Members of Congress would not be able to hide their responsibility. The time for Congress to live up to this responsibility is now, before it is too late.

<title>Russian Hardliners' Military Doctrine: In Their Own Words - Heritage</title>

<h3>RUSSIAN HARDLINERS' MILITARY DOCTRINE: IN THEIR OWN WORDS</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen, Ph.D.</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>

F.Y.I. No. 104<br>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some Western leaders and policymakers are remarkably unconcerned about the prospects of a victory by Communist Party candidate Gennady Zyuganov in the Russian presidential elections on June 16. Thinking that a communist return to power in Russia will be no different than it was in Poland or Slovakia, these Westerners appear to believe that a communist victory in Russia will not disrupt the burgeoning "partnership" between Russia and the West.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
However, the report translated here paints a different picture. Written by hard-line members of a nationalist-communist coalition that supports Zyuganov for president but maintains close ties with such nationalists as Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the document contains advice for Russian military planners that is profoundly disturbing for the United States and the West. No amount of "mirror imaging" in the U.S. or Western democracies can obscure the meaning of Russian hardliners as rendered in their own words.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among the report's main points:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Russia should be moving aggressively to adopt a nuclear deterrence posture for perceived non-nuclear threats. Strategic nuclear forces should be the highest priority.
<p>
<li>Russia should be able to fight at least one full-scale regional war, one smaller-scale conflict, and at least three "peacemaking" operations outside its borders.
<p>
<li>The U.S. and NATO remain Russia's enemies. Other foes include Turkey and countries of the former Soviet Union such as the Baltic States.
<p>
<li>Russia's armed forces should be drastically reorganized on the basis of smaller, highly mobile units.
<p>
<li>Russia should be prepared to undertake military operations to reconquer the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union. These operations would include seizing command-and-control sites, "eliminating" the political-military leadership, and deporting "some categories" of the hostile population, presumably to the Russian hinterland.
</ul> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The authors of these positions are analysts who advise the president and the Russian General Staff on military and security matters. One author is Lieutenant General Valeriy Dementyev, who was once Deputy Chief of Armaments in the USSR Ministry of defense, and today is an analyst with the Institute for Defense Research (known by its Russian acronym INOBIS, <I>Institut oboronnykh issledovanii</I>) in the town of Kaliningrad near Moscow. The other author is Anton Surikov, a defense analyst formerly associated with the USA-Canada Institute and also an analyst at the Institute for Defense Research. The secretive INOBIS is financed by the Russian General Staff, military-industrial enterprises, and the Atomic Energy Ministry, and conducts classified research. It was founded by senior figures from the KGB and the Russian military-industrial complex. Also instrumental in its founding was Yuri Maslyukov, Zyuganov's chief economic policy maker and the former head of the USSR's Central Planning Authority (the all-powerful GosPlan). INOBIS reportedly enjoys an attentive audience at the Ministry of Defense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
People like Surikov and Dementyev advise Communist Party leader Zyuganov, radical nationalist Zhirinovsky, and President Boris Yeltsin's Atomic Energy Minister, Viktor Mikhailov. Even if Zyuganov loses the presidential elections, the views expressed in this report will influence Russian military and security policy. Many in the Russian armed forces and security services support a more aggressive stance for Russia -- a viewpoint clearly expressed in this document.
<p>

The Heritage Foundation thanks Harriet and Bill Scott, leading experts on the Soviet and Russian military, for their kind assistance in translating this report.

<center><h3>ARMY REFORM AND SECURITY:<br>
Conceptual Theses of the Strategy of Reforming The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation</h3>

by Valeriy Dementyev, Lieutenant General (Ret.) and Doctor of Technical Sciences, and Anton Surikov, Doctor of Technical Sciences
</center><P>

<b>Deterrence and Defense</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The defensive character of the policy of the Russian Federation (RF) in the military area and the absence in Russia of aggressive intentions was proclaimed in the <I>Basic Provisions of the Military Doctrine of the RF</I>, unveiled in 1993.<sup>1</sup>  This thesis, however, is in need of clarification in terms of the precise tasks that the Armed Forces face. Among them, first of all, three basic tasks should be singled out:
<P><ul>
<li>The Armed Forces must have the capability to deter effectively the threat of nuclear attack on Russia and on the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which have signed the agreement on collective security. In this, the talk is exclusively about deterrence, because national military thought acknowledges the impossibility of victory in a global nuclear conflict on the strategic level.
<p>
<li>The Armed Forces should be aimed both at deterring a large-scale military attack on Russia and the CIS by foreign governments or a coalition thereof using conventional armaments, and deterring and repelling military aggression from the outside that has more limited goals. Deterrence of such threats can be nuclear.
<p>
<li>The Armed Forces must have the capability to conduct local wars and carry out peacemaking operations, primarily within the bounds of the former USSR, taking into account that the former Soviet Union is a zone of Russian vital interests and home to 25 million ethnic Russians. Currently, the Russian Federation is conducting two local wars on the territory of the former USSR -- in Chechnya and Tajikistan. Besides that, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are fulfilling peacemaking functions that are in fact deterring Georgia and Moldova from commencing aggression towards Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Trans-Dniester.<sup>2</sup>  Taking into account the practices of 1990-1996, the demand must be put forward, in part, for the capability to wage local wars within the bounds of the former USSR. The Armed Forces should be able to take part simultaneously in at least one local war of high intensity, at least one "slow" local war, and at least three "frozen" local conflicts and peacemaking operations.
</ul><P>
<b>Russia's Enemies</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The thesis of the <I>Basic Provisions</I> is that Russia has no outside enemies. Experience has demonstrated the falseness of this thesis. Because of Russia's weak government and the progressive degradation of its military and economic potential, outside enemies are making themselves known in a bolder and more open fashion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Currently, Russia's basic probable enemies remain the United States and the NATO countries. The United States has a vast nuclear missile potential which, if used, can destroy Russia as a state. It was created with the goal of nuclear blackmail of the USSR and was oriented mainly at carrying out a first nuclear strike. At present, in spite of ongoing reductions within the framework of START 1, orientation toward a first strike not only has not disappeared, but actually has been increased. This is due primarily to the policy of the [American] authorities, particularly the U.S. Congress, toward revision of the ABM Treaty of 1972 and creates the prerequisites for development and subsequent deployment of a strategic ABM system by the year 2003.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In contrast to the Warsaw Pact Treaty Organization, not only has NATO, led by the USA, not been dissolved, but the decision already has been made to enlarge it. NATO's infrastructure, despite the reduction of personnel and armaments taking place under the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, is still oriented toward actions in an eastern direction. The preservation of its basic military infrastructure gives it an opportunity to build up its troops quickly should such a decision be made. Although, as of today, the potential of NATO conventional forces is not sufficient to conduct a large-scale offensive operation against the Russian Federation similar to Hitler's invasion of 1941, over time these forces can be augmented and advanced to the borders of the Russian Federation. In this light, the plans for NATO eastern expansion look clearly aggressive. Moreover, in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary measures are now being taken to adapt the infrastructure, airport network, communications, etc., for NATO use. One Hungarian airport, without prior permission, has been turned into an American military base.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It should be noted that the experience of the U.S. and NATO in the Persian Gulf in 1991, and in the former Yugoslavia in 1995-1996, demonstrates that the [Western] bloc today has sufficient potential to carry out military operations with limited goals on the periphery of post-Soviet territory. In this scenario, the greatest danger is presented by aggression from three possible directions: first, because of Norway's recent decision to expand NATO military activity in the north of the country, from the north against the Russian Federation's Northern Fleet on the Kola peninsula; second, in connection with the discussion about creating a 60,000-strong Baltic Corps from German, Danish, and Polish detachments, from the northwest in the form of military intervention by NATO in case of a conflict between Russia and the Baltic countries; and third, in light of the calls being heard to grant the countries of the Caspian basin NATO security guarantees similar to those given to the countries of the Persian Gulf, from the south, where the key role is assigned to a member of NATO -- Turkey.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Turkey possesses an army of 600,000. Its navy is already bigger than the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Turkey has unilaterally altered the status of the Black Sea straits, threatening Russia's interests. It has voiced numerous military threats toward Russia's ally Armenia with regard to the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. Turkey is attempting to attract into its sphere of influence the Turkish-speaking and Muslim regions of the former USSR. It has been proven that Turkish officials supported [President] Dudaev's illegal military detachments in Chechnya. They also assisted the "Gray Wolves" organization in Azerbaijan and a number of other nationalistic military detachments throughout the CIS.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Japan, which is an ally of the United States and has territorial claims against the Russian Federation, might also be considered a potential enemy of Russia. Today, Japan does not have sufficient military power to start an aggressive military operation against Russia in order to take the islands of the Southern Kurils by force, but it does have the necessary potential to expand its Armed Forces quickly.
<p>
<b>China and Iran Are Not Enemies</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Obviously, the fact that Russia and China are neighbors must not be ignored when planning the development of the Armed Forces. At the same time, the military policy of the Russian Federation should be formed with extreme caution with respect to China. The U.S., seeing China as a potential enemy, is interested in creating a military confrontation between Russia and China.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similarly, the U.S. has a clear interest in the confrontation between the Russian Federation and Iran, another American enemy. The "Islamic threat" to the CIS is used as an argument to promote a similar confrontation. After a close examination of this problem, however, it becomes clear that the extremist movements in the CIS that operate under pseudo-Islamic slogans are relying as a rule not on Iran, but on pro-Western regimes in the Muslim world: Turkey, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In light of the above, it is not practical to view Iran and China as probable enemies of Russia, at least in the near future, because there are no objective causes for confrontation between the Russian Federation and those countries.
<p>
<b>Recreating the Empire</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Within the territory of post-Soviet Russia, the main enemies are the forces of aggressive nationalism that operate with support from outside and have armed forces of their own: armies, police, and other militarized detachments of the Baltic states; Dudayev's illegal armed forces; Tajik opposition illegal armed forces; and others. The main causes of conflict involving the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation within the territory of the former USSR are the following:
<ul><p>
<li>Ethnic discord and genocide of national minorities. Examples of such conflicts where Russian Federation (USSR) Armed Forces were used, directly or indirectly, would be Trans-Dniester in 1992, the Prigorodniy region in Northern Ossetia at the end of 1992, Southern Ossetia in 1991-1992, and Abkhazia in 1992-1993.
<p>
In the near future, ethnic conflicts probably will have two major causes. First, as a result of the events of 1991, Russians are a divided people. Therefore, their objective tendency to reunite will become stronger as time goes on. Second, in all former USSR countries, except for Belorussia and perhaps Ukraine, ethnic minorities are subjected to discrimination.<sup>3</sup>  This is most clearly evident in the Baltic countries where, with the encouragement of Western institutions, human rights violations based on ethnic origin are part of official policy. The Baltic countries seem to be the most potentially explosive in terms of the possibility of new areas of conflict that could involve the Russian Federation's Armed Forces.
<p>
<li>Attempts by nationalist forces to seize power by armed force or to hold power in some republic of the former USSR. Examples include Tajikistan in 1992-1996, Lithuania in January 1991, Georgia during the winter of 1991-1992 and at the end of 1993, and Azerbaijan in January 1990 and the summer of 1993.
<p>
<li>Territorial claims against the Russian Federation and illegal attempts to seize sea and inland water resources that belong to Russia. Up to now, direct Russian participation in such armed conflicts has been avoided. But it is not out of the question, particularly because of the Baku government's policy of annexing part of the Caspian Sea, an inland body of water the rights to which should be shared equally by all countries bordering the region. Another potential source of conflict is the part of the Baltic Sea area that belongs to Russia but is claimed by Lithuania. It also is known that the ethnocratic regimes of Tallin and Riga are claiming a part of the Russian Federation's Northwestern territory.
<p>
<li>The desire of certain forces in the former USSR, primarily in the Baltic countries, to become a part of the NATO alliance. In such cases, one cannot exclude preemptive use of force by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation to stop decisively any practical steps that might be taken by armed nationalist detachments to implement their provocative plans.
</ul><p>
<b>Budget Priorities</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Obviously, in the near term, reform of the Russian Federation's Armed Forces will be conducted under conditions of deep economic crisis. Thus, the decisive factor in choosing among possible reforms will be that the budget for the Armed Forces and military-industrial complex is limited. One of the main requirements will be to minimize the country's budget for defense. This, in turn, means that the established practice of allocating funds equally among the existing branches of the Armed Forces will have to be abandoned.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is necessary to determine which programs are crucial to sustaining the Armed Forces' ability to accomplish their main objectives and guarantee their financing. At the same time, it is unavoidable that programs which do not have a high priority will have to be financed from the "leftovers" of the military budget. Despite the importance of the transition to a professional army in the near future, it will be impossible to avoid using the draft to raise manpower. The Armed Forces will have to be reduced to 1.2 million servicemen.
<p>
<b>The Main Deterrent: Strategic Nuclear Forces</b>

In resolving the task of nuclear deterrence on the strategic level, the basic role should be played by strategic nuclear forces and systems supporting their combat functioning. Without strategic nuclear forces, Russia cannot exist as an independent, unified state. The task of sustaining them should be given the highest priority and should be fully financed. As of today, [Russia's] strategic nuclear forces face three major problems:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Degradation of strategic nuclear forces.</b> This concerns primarily the naval component of the strategic nuclear forces, in which the scheduled maintenance of weapon systems is constantly being violated and the operational strength of strategic nuclear submarines has gone down drastically. Since 1990, not a single new strategic nuclear submarine has been launched; considering the life cycle of submarines in the naval strategic nuclear forces, this means they could disappear within 15 years. It is most important to finish the scientific research and test construction work needed to create strategic nuclear submarines of a new generation which will carry new ballistic missiles by the years 2000-2003, as well as to ensure that these strategic nuclear submarines are brought into service at the rate of 2-3 submarines every two years.
<p>
<li><b>Absence of clarity regarding the quantitative framework within which it is planned to develop strategic nuclear forces.</b> In 1994, START I was implemented. START II was signed but is not yet ratified. With regard to the naval and aviation components of the strategic nuclear forces, the existence of uncertainty concerning the fate of the treaty does not affect seriously their future development. According to START II, the naval strategic nuclear forces can be armed with 1,750 warheads after 2003. Roughly the same quantity was to be allowed under START I. Aviation strategic nuclear forces, which historically have played a very insignificant role in the national nuclear triad, will have 93 heavy bombers with approximately 500 cruise missiles, including 19 Tu-95 heavy bombers and several dozen heavy bombers acquired in Ukraine by agreement. The production of additional heavy bombers is very costly and thus is hardly advisable.
<p>
A more complex situation exists in units of the Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF). According to START II, which requires the liquidation of ICBMs with MIRV warheads, the SRF by the year 2003 can rely on approximately 1,000 single-warhead ICBMs. At present, there are 350 mobile SS-25s with single warheads, which are to be replaced in the next few years, as their useful life expires, by "Topol-M" ICBMs. According to the agreement, Russia will have 105 MIRVed ICBMs, which are to be "unloaded" until only one warhead each remains, and 90 single SS-18 ICBMs placed into refitted silos. To support the START II quota for the number of warheads, Russia will have to form more than 10 additional divisions of mobile ICBMs with approximately 500 "Topol-M" ICBMs by the year 2003 -- in other words, practically double the number of mobile, single-warhead ICBMs. Another possible option is to build new silos for new ICBMs. Even with priority financing, it is very difficult for the SRF to do this within such a limited time frame.
<p>
In general, the START II treaty is rather paradoxical. It calls for quick liquidation of more than 200 MIRVed Russian ICBMs, part of which could still be used for another 4-5 years. At the same time, in order to maintain quantitative parity with the U.S., several hundred single-warhead ICBMs should be deployed, and possibly placed into newly built silos, even as some of the old silos are to be destroyed under START II. Note that the United States plans to go from START I to START II in a different fashion. It will eliminate only 50 "MX" missiles, 4 "Ohio" strategic nuclear submarines, and 28 heavy bombers with cruise missiles. The main cuts are to be accomplished by "unloading" the missiles and storing the warheads in special storage facilities. At any moment, this stockpile, which the United States emphatically refuses to destroy, might be put back into operation on U.S. missiles. As a result, taking into account the potential for "quick loading" of these missiles, the U.S. will surpass Russia by 1,000-1,500 warheads.
<P>
Russia's refusal to follow START II will bring onto the agenda the issue of supporting MIRVed ICBMs. Analysis proves that this problem can be solved in principle. Different options are available. For instance, additional SS-18s can be purchased from Ukraine. Also, purely Russian MIRVed ICBMs can be designed; a 120-ton liquid fueled missile with 10 warheads could be created in 3-5 years after the appropriate decision. In the next 5-7 years, 300 such missiles can be placed into existing silos. Given these facts, in spite of widespread misconceptions, spending for this project could be quite moderate. At the stage of scientific research and test construction work, the amount would be several percent less per year than the amount allocated to "rebuild" Chechnya in 1996. At the development stage, given that the warheads would be available, production and installation of 300 of such missiles would be three times cheaper than the cost of constructing in the same period 500 "Topol-M" ICBMs in their mobile version or in new silos, as discussed above in relation to START II.
<p>
<li><b>Flaws in the command and control structure of the strategic nuclear forces.</b> It is proposed, within the framework of measures for development of the strategic nuclear forces, to design in an organized manner a single, self-contained operational command and control system for all groupings of strategic nuclear forces, including support systems, based on the administrative structure developed in the Strategic Rocket Forces. Practical implementation of this proposal could be achieved within a year after the appropriate decision is made. The main reasons such a step is necessary are the increased demands for combat readiness in the strategic nuclear forces, economy of means, and elimination of parallel structures. It would be advisable to transfer the Military Space Forces to the Strategic Rocket Forces to bring under their functional control the Missile Attack Warning System, the Space Control System, the Moscow ABM System, and corresponding testing sites. The naval and aviation strategic nuclear forces (functionally left in the Navy and Air Forces, respectively) also should be transferred to the single operational command and control of the strategic nuclear forces.
<p>
At the present time, several hundred thousand servicemen, a third of them officers, are performing their military service in groupings of the strategic nuclear forces. In the Strategic Rocket Forces, for all practical purposes, combat crews of officers carry out in practice 100 percent of the direct functional duties connected with exploitation of the weapons. As for the draftees, they primarily carry out functions as guards and perform auxiliary tasks in supporting combat readiness, technical support, etc. A similar situation, as a whole, characterizes the other components of the strategic nuclear forces and their support systems. It is proposed that the ratio between professionals and conscripts be maintained in the future as well.
<p>
Since the U.S. and NATO possess conventional forces and armaments potentially sufficient to conduct military operations with limited goals on the periphery of post-Soviet territory, it is necessary to provide for deterrence of such actions by the probable enemy. Currently, functions for deterring aggression from the most probable directions are given:
<ul><p>
<li>In the north (the naval bases on the Kola peninsula), to forces of the Leningrad Military District (MD) and Northern Fleet (NF).
<p>
<li>In the northwest, (the Baltic region), to forces of the Leningrad MD, Kaliningrad special region, and forces of the Baltic Fleet.
<p>
<li>In the south (the Caucasus-Caspian region), to forces of the North Caucasus Military district; subunits of the Russian Armed Forces on bases in Gyumri and Yerevan (Armenia), Tbilisi and Ahalkalaki (Georgia), Batumi (Adjaria), and Gudauta (Abkhazia); forces of the Caspian Flotilla; and the Black Sea fleet.
</ul><p>
Analysis shows that the existing deterrence potential of the Russian Federation Armed Forces in these directions might be insufficient to deter aggressive action by the probable enemy. Strengthening these forces by carrying out a long-term buildup in the number of troops and armaments in regions of probable conflict could be hard to achieve economically. In light of this, as a priority task facing the Armed Forces, it is proposed to create, within a year after a decision is made, Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces numbering about 10,000 servicemen. Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces could operate as a reserve of the Supreme High Command and, on a long-term basis, could assume the function of deterring the probable enemy from conducting military operations with local goals.
<p>
For this proposal to be implemented at the initial stage, it is suggested to supply the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces with 10-12 missile and aviation complexes equipped with conventional precision weapons from the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and Air Forces. These missile and aviation complexes, while remaining functionally a part of the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and Air Forces, and based deep within Russian territory during peacetime, would be subordinated operationally, through a Main Directorate of the General Staff specially created for these purposes, to the Supreme High Command of the Russian Armed Forces. During a threatening period, Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces, by decision of the Supreme High Command, could be redeployed to the region of possible conflict and aimed on especially important targets deep in the probable enemy's territory.
<p>
In the event plans for the eastern expansion of NATO are realized or new directions of possible aggression appear (for instance, the Southern Kuril Island), it would be expedient to increase the number of the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces' missile and aviation complexes to 30-50 units. At the same time, units of missile artillery and aviation complexes could be armed with nuclear weapons. To demonstrate persuasively to a probable enemy the RF's determination to impede any NATO advancement into the territory of the former USSR, some Operational-Tactical Deterrent Force units also could be moved up to the borders, particularly the Russian-Norwegian border; to Russian military bases in Armenia, Georgia, Adzharia, and Abkhazia; to the Kaliningrad special region; and into Belorussia, to which President A. G. Lukashenko has agreed in principle.
</ul><P>
<b>The Mobile Forces: Mainstay of the Russian Army</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is advisable when waging local wars within the former USSR to give the main functions to special elite units: Mobile Forces of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, which also must have priority designation. Not intended for participation in extended military conflicts, these units could be used on a short-term basis in holding actions and to repel aggression from abroad against Russia and the CIS using conventional weapons. They also could be designated for peacekeeping operations under the aegis of CIS, as well as the UN and other international organizations. It is advisable to form Mobile Forces, up to 90,000 strong, based on Airborne troops and using some units of naval infantry, over a year after a corresponding decision is made. Functionally, naval infantry would stay under Navy command and would be transferred to operational Mobile Forces command only for the conduct of special operations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For five years after forming these Mobile Forces, it is suggested that recruitment be exclusively on a contract basis. After the process of turning them into a professional force is complete, Mobile Forces should be fully staffed and given all kinds of heavy armaments and equipment. Moreover, the number of naval infantry should be increased with the assistance of the Baltic Fleet, Black Sea Fleet, and Caspian Flotilla, which are located in potential conflict areas of the Caucasus and Baltic countries. Special attention should be paid to the creation of naval infantry in the Caspian region because of the extremely high probability of conflict arising from the unresolved problem of the status of the Caspian shelf.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is important to equip Mobile Forces with military transport aviation (MTA), which will belong functionally to the Air Forces and be operationally subordinate to the Commander in Chief of the Air Forces but required to carry out orders of the Mobile Forces. The need for MTA aircraft designated to move personnel and military equipment, including heavy military equipment, is estimated at 100 aircraft. Most of the aircraft in MTA available today are not functioning. Therefore, about 30-40 additional aircraft should be brought into service because of the extreme importance of the tasks performed by the Mobile Forces.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A typical special operation involving Mobile Forces and aimed at liberating a large area of the former USSR from nationalists should be based on the following principles. The commander of the operation is appointed and should receive a legally valid order. The date and time of the operation then are set. A rigid system of unified command is established so that operational command over all utilized forces, regardless of departmental subordination and affiliation, is concentrated in the hands of a single person.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the first stage, aviation, special military intelligence (GRU) forces, and special Federal Security Services (FSB) and Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) groups carry out strikes for the purpose of destroying or seizing the most important enemy targets and eliminating the enemy's military and political leadership. Then Mobile Forces, with the support of army and frontline aviation and naval forces, crush and eliminate enemy forces and take over their territory. After that, subunits of Ground Forces and Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, RF, preferably with some combat experience, move in. They establish control of the most crucial locations and carry out "cleansing" of the territory. Then, with the help of militia formed out of the pro-Russian part of the local population, they establish control over the territory and ensure the elimination of nationalists and deportation of some categories of citizens from certain locations. It should be emphasized that until the end of the special operation, local authorities are needed only insofar as they are useful in supporting military control over the territory.
<P>
<b>Winners and Losers</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Military intelligence plays a most important role in achieving the main goals of the Armed Forces. Making the GRU (Main Intelligence Directorate) and its subunits and structures more effective should be given the highest priority.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To implement these proposals, half the personnel of the Armed Forces would have to go to the four most important components of the Armed Forces named above, which also should be given priority in financing. Because the economic situation in the country is difficult, the other half of the Armed Forces would have to exist under tight financial limitations.
<ul><p>
<li><b>The Navy is the most expensive of the Armed Forces.</b> A differentiated approach is needed here. Naval strategic nuclear forces cannot be underfinanced. The situation is more complex with respect to providing for the combat stability of naval strategic nuclear forces. The system exists and should be preserved, but this does not require building large ships. Aircraft carriers are an exception, since two carriers each are needed in the Pacific Fleet and Northern Fleet to meet military goals. There are only two at present, and the country's economic situation does not allow for two more.
<p>
To provide for anti-submarine warfare in oceanic theaters of military operations (TVD), there are in service submarines and ships equipped with special arms. This equipment should be maintained and ships and submarines currently under construction should be finished, but no new ones should be built for the time being.
<p>

With respect to combating enemy aircraft carriers, there are no battle groups now in place. Our recommendation is to maintain the status quo and concentrate on retaining existing levels.
<p>
With reference to landing support for naval infantry, the appropriate infrastructure was built by the USSR. It is important not only to stop its destruction, but also to continue its development, since costs will not be high but will allow it to perform tasks of the Mobile Forces with great effectiveness.
<p>
In protecting sea communications, special attention should be paid to protecting lines of communication with the Kaliningrad Special Region. At the same time, activities in the remote oceanic regions should be limited.
<p>
The existing system for the coastal defense of the Russian Federation should be supported and developed, since no big investments are needed here. Finally, it is necessary to abandon the tasks of combating transatlantic shipments of U.S. forces and combating the enemy's surface ships and submarines armed with cruise missiles.
<p>
<li><b>There are two large groups in the Ground Forces today. </b>One was deployed in the Far East Military District and Trans-Baikal Military District during the time of tense relations with China. In subsequent years, it was degraded less than other groups. Another large group was developed for obvious reasons in the North Caucasus Military District. It is reasonable to continue to support these groups. For the North Caucasus Military District, this means confirming the exception of District units from the treaty on Conventional Forces Reductions in Europe at the May conference of participants. It is unacceptable that the issue of the North Caucasus Military District be linked with the proposal made by a number of countries that the numbers of Russian forces in the Kaliningrad Special Region be cut; in light of Poland's and the Baltic countries' plans to join NATO, the very fact that the issue of the Kaliningrad Special Region has come up seems both ambiguous and a provocation. A limited number of Ground Forces are located in the strategically important Leningrad and Moscow Military Districts. From the west, Moscow is covered by only two army divisions. As there is no danger of a large-scale invasion of Russia similar to the invasion of 1941, the development of forces to the west of Moscow should not be hurried. But in the event the Eastern European countries join NATO and the infrastructure for an invasion force appears, Russia will be forced to respond accordingly. One possible response might be to recreate the Belorussian Military District and deploy Ground Forces and frontal aviation of the Air Forces there.
<p>
Also, since it currently is difficult for Russia to maintain parity with NATO in conventional weapons, the primary emphasis should be assigned to tactical nuclear deterrence of the threat of non-nuclear attack by NATO forces. This approach will require arming the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and frontal aviation of the Air Forces with nuclear weapons and will be much less expensive than providing a non-nuclear deterrent force for a non-nuclear invasion. In general, the present weakness of Russia dictates reliance on nuclear weapons, including tactical weapons. Today, the only possible way to deter NATO is through nuclear deterrence. At the same time, should the relationship between Russia and China change, the same approach can be used in Central Asia and the Far East.
<p>
An important problem in the Ground Forces is revision of the list of units in military districts and the discovery of units which can be cut. It is advisable to limit the number of divisions to 30-35, of which 15-20 could be manned with conscripts and work on combat readiness while the other 15, evenly spread around the country, would be cadre and would serve as a base in preparing the mobilization reserve. At the same time, preparation of the mobilization reserve should be conducted within the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and Border Guards.
<p>
<li><b>In units of the Air Forces, special attention should be concentrated on maintaining military transport, frontal aviation, and aviation of the strategic nuclear forces, which could be used by the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces and Mobile Forces, at the required level.</b> A major task is preserving qualifications of flying personnel. The Air Defense of military districts should be given to the Air Forces from the Troops of Air Defense, disbanding the latter units but retaining their combat readiness requirements. The missile attack warning system, space control system, and Moscow ABM System, as well as their corresponding testing grounds, would be transferred to the Strategic Rocket Forces. The Air Defense system that is maintaining CIS perimeter defense also would be transferred to the Air Force. Another possible solution is to give it to the Federal Border Guard Service. This would be logical, because they are not now able to defend against a massive air attack from the probable enemy. The circle of tasks resolved by them, in fact, is limited to early warning of an unsanctioned intrusion of CIS airspace and interception of individual targets. This is more a function of the Border Guard, not the Armed Forces. Moreover, the Federal Border Guard Service looks after the ground and marine border. It would be logical to close the loop by giving them the air component as well.
<p></ul>
<b>Legislative Priorities</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is proposed that in the immediate future, it is necessary to prepare and confirm in the Federal Assembly (parliament) a national security doctrine and a military doctrine for the Russian Federation. Based on these doctrines, a five-year plan of reform for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation should be developed and adopted.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This current document can be used both to prepare the national security and military doctrines and to prepare the plan of reform for the Armed Forces.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
On May 20, President Bill Clinton announced his intention to extend unconditionally China's most-favored-nation trade status for another year. At the end of this month, Congress will vote on a resolution to revoke MFN trade status for the People's Republic of China. Legislation also may be proposed to make MFN status contingent on improvements in China's human rights conditions or its implementation of international commercial and security agreements.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

As Congress considers extending or revoking MFN status for China, it is important to focus on what MFN is and is not. A fundamental principle of the Bretton Woods trading system created at the end of World War II,<sup>1</sup> MFN was intended to protect the U.S. from protectionism. It is not a special privilege for any country, including China. Rather, it is the norm for trade between countries. Thus, revoking MFN for any country is the equivalent of imposing enormous punitive sanctions. But trade sanctions are not an effective tool for achieving such non-trade objectives as ending human rights abuses.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Administration's decision to extend MFN treatment is the right decision, but it should be only one element of a comprehensive strategy for dealing with China. This strategy should consist of a series of policies that directly protect or promote long-run U.S. interests in Asia, such as free access to markets or peace and stability. As important as having the right strategy is creating a constructive environment within which policies can operate. This environment has not been created by the Clinton Administration. The zig-zags in its China policy have undermined the credibility of its strategy and raised serious questions in the minds of friend and foe alike as to America's future role in Asia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

To protect its interests in peace and stability, freedom of the seas, and access to markets in Asia, the U.S. must create an environment that encourages China to integrate into the international system as a responsible member. Given its size and rate of growth, China is certain to have an enormous impact on the international system and American interests in Asia. For China to become a full participant in the international system and uphold international rules and norms, Chinese leaders must see that doing so will best serve China's interests. This can be accomplished only if Americans interact with, rather than isolate, China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 


To advance American interests in Asia, the President and Congress should:<ul>
<p><li>Renew China's MFN status. This is the right decision and should be supported by the Congress.

<p><li><b>Invite China's President Jiang Zemin to the White House for a full state visit.</b> This gesture could help avoid future misunderstandings by directly communicating America's fundamental Asian interests and concerns at the highest level.

<p><li><b>Follow a more broad-based strategy toward Asia.</b> Rather than confront China directly, the U.S. should seek to expand investment and trade with India and Indonesia. Knowing that the U.S. has credible alternatives to the China market, China's leaders will no longer be able to take American involvement in China for granted.

<p><li><b>Use policy tools better suited to the problem.</b> When China violates a U.S. law or international agreement, the U.S. should apply the penalty prescribed in that law or agreement. In other words, if China violates the Missile Control Technology Regime, the U.S. should coordinate its response with other MCTR members and apply the sanctions outlined in the law that ratified U.S. membership in that regime. The U.S. should not revoke MFN or impose sanctions that are not relevant to the specific broken law or agreement.

<p><li><b>Repeal or amend the Jackson-Vanik Amendment.</b> This amendment to the 1974 Trade Act is outdated. Its primary target no longer exists, and its freedom of emigration requirements are inappropriate for China. </ul><p>


<b>AMERICA'S STRATEGIC INTERESTS AND MFN</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Over the past two centuries, the U.S. has sought consistently to protect three fundamental interests in Asia: 1) regional peace and stability, 2) freedom of navigation on the high seas, and 3) free access to the region's markets. These interests provide a firm foundation for a healthy and growing American economy. They also help promote a stable and secure world in which political and economic freedom, human rights, and democratic institutions can flourish. These interests allow the U.S. to maintain a system of healthy, cooperative, and politically vigorous relations with allies and friendly nations.<sup>2</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

MFN plays a fundamental role in advancing these enduring American interests in Asia. Most-favored-nation treatment is the normal tariff treatment that the United States provides to all but a handful of its trading partners.<sup>3</sup>  It is a principle which undergirds the open international trading system that the U.S. has labored for decades to expand, not merely a bargaining chip in the U.S.-China relationship that holds America's trade and economic interests around the globe hostage to the ups and downs of its political relationship with China. MFN has been, in fact, a key ingredient of America's global strategy since World War II. The purpose of this strategy has been to build a cooperative free-trade environment within which America's businesses and economy can prosper. It also has been to protect the United States and the world from reliving the tragic consequences of the isolationism and protectionism that plagued the 1930s.
<P>

<b>HISTORICAL ROOTS OF MFN STATUS FOR CHINA</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	The U.S. first introduced the notion of most-favored-nation trade status into the U.S.-China relationship in the 19th century to ensure the survival of American commercial interests in Asia. After the Opium Wars of the mid-19th century, several foreign powers won concessions from China and sought to establish exclusive areas of influence along China's coast. American leaders considered these actions a threat to the U.S. interest in free access to the markets of Asia. In order to keep Britain, Germany, Japan, or China from excluding the U.S. from the Chinese market, the U.S. induced China to agree to an MFN provision in its treaty obligations with the U.S.<sup>4</sup>  This provision required that any future concession that the Chinese government granted to a third power would be extended simultaneously and automatically to the U.S. as well. MFN was not considered a tool by which America would realize the full potential of the enormous Chinese market. Rather, it was one means by which the U.S. could guarantee itself equal access to that market.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The United States extended MFN status to all of its trading partners as a matter of statutory policy in 1934. The scope of this policy narrowed as the Cold War intensified. Section 5 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 required President Truman to suspend the MFN status of the Soviet Union and all countries under the control of international communism. In accordance with this act, the President suspended China's most-favored-nation status on September 1, 1951, approximately two years after the establishment of the People's Republic of China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Trade Act of 1974 set forth new conditions for the restoration of MFN to "nonmarket economy" countries such as China.<sup>5</sup>  According to Title IV, in order to grant MFN status to China, the President must satisfy two conditions:
<ul> 

<p><li>Condition #1: A trade agreement that includes MFN for the U.S. Under Section 405 in Title IV of the 1974 Trade Act, in order to conclude a trade agreement with China, the President must first determine that any reductions in U.S. trade barriers are reciprocated by China. In other words, as the U.S. lowers tariffs on imports from China, China simultaneously will reduce tariffs on U.S. exports to China.

<p><li>Condition #2: Freedom of emigration. This second requirement is much more contentious. Section 402 of the 1974 Trade Act, known as the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, was intended to pressure the Soviet Union to allow Jews to emigrate.<sup>6</sup>  Over time, this provision has become, albeit inadvertently, the legal basis for the current annual debate over renewal of China's MFN status. The Amendment calls on the President to deny MFN treatment to any nonmarket economy country which the President determines denies, seriously restricts, or burdens its citizens' right to emigrate. This freedom of emigration requirement can be waived annually, and it is around this annual waiver that the current debate over China's MFN status revolves.</ul>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

In the process of normalizing relations with the PRC, President Jimmy Carter in 1979 used presidential authority to conclude a three-year bilateral trade agreement with China in which China granted MFN status to the U.S. This satisfied the first requirement for granting MFN to a nonmarket economy country. The U.S. trade agreement with China, which entered into force on February 1, 1980, provides for automatic three-year extensions. Since China is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 405 of the 1974 Trade Act, however, these "automatic" extensions require the President to certify that China reciprocates reductions in U.S. trade barriers.

<b>MFN Procedures and China</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The  problem is that President Carter did not completely resolve the second requirement for extending MFN status to China. To grant MFN to China, the President must determine that China permits free and unrestricted emigration of its citizens or waive for 12 months the requirements for full compliance with Jackson-Vanik. President Carter in 1980 waived the Jackson-Vanik requirements for 12 months rather than certify China's full compliance with its freedom of emigration strictures. This has been done by every President since then. In every June since 1980, the President has had to decide whether or not to waive for another 12 months the freedom of emigration requirements in the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Moreover, each year after the President's decision has been made, Congress has had an opportunity to review the President's decision and to decide whether to vote on a resolution to discontinue MFN.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

According to the procedures outlined in Section 402 of the 1974 Trade Act, once the President has waived the Jackson-Vanik requirements, he must submit to Congress a recommendation for a 12-month extension of the waiver authority. This recommendation, along with the President's reasons for granting it, must be submitted to Congress during the final 30 days of the current waiver. The President's recommendation traditionally has been sent by June 3 of each year. Extension of the waiver authority is automatic unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted into law within 60 days after the expiration of the previous waiver authority, which typically is by the end of August. Although resolutions of disapproval have been considered by Congress, MFN treatment for China has continued uninterrupted since 1980 under annual renewal of the waiver.
<p>

<b>ISSUES ENTANGLED IN MFN DEBATE</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	Automatic extension of the three-year U.S. trade agreement with China and the annual presidential waiver of Jackson-Vanik requirements went smoothly throughout the 1980s, as China embarked on massive and largely successful economic reforms. Market capitalism was introduced incrementally into the Chinese economy to improve efficiency and to hasten modernization. Many in China readily admitted the failures of socialism and looked to the West for new methods to improve living standards. President Ronald Reagan visited China in 1984 and declared the dawning of a new era of freedom for the Chinese people.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

But this honeymoon in Sino-American relations came to an abrupt halt on June 4, 1989, when the People's Liberation Army used deadly force against the students and workers who had gathered in protest at Tiananmen Square. In response, President George Bush invoked a series of sanctions against China. These included restrictions on arms and munitions sales, military exchanges, transfer of dual-use technologies, and U.S. government financing for projects in China. The objective was to punish the government of China without unnecessarily injuring the people of China. This same rationale was advanced to explain the continuation of MFN status for China. Revoking MFN would have injured a wide range of people in China that the U.S. wanted to help, including economic reformers and entrepreneurs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

A majority in Congress, however, did not agree with the President's decision. Each year, from 1990-1992, Congress voted to disapprove extension of MFN status to China. President Bush repeatedly used his veto authority to defeat these congressional resolutions. Members of Congress argued that the U.S. should make China's leaders pay for their brutality and that it was immoral for Americans to seek profit under such circumstances. Every year, this "automatic" procedure has provided a forum for a well-orchestrated recitation of all the ills for which China's government is held responsible.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Four years ago, candidate Bill Clinton scolded President Bush for "coddling tyrants" and vowed to make the "butchers of Beijing" pay by attaching requirements for improved human rights conditions to the continuation of MFN for China. This was his intention when on May 28, 1993, President Clinton issued an executive order which continued China's unconditional MFN status for another year but attached new conditions to China's renewal in subsequent years.<sup>8</sup>  The executive order required China to halt exports of prison labor products to the U.S. and mandated that the Secretary of State determine whether China had made "significant progress" on human rights.<sup>9</sup>  After a year of strained diplomatic relations, President Clinton, despite his campaign threats, renewed China's MFN status on May 26, 1994. He did so without declaring that China had made significant progress in human rights protection, effectively de-linking human rights from trade issues.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Although human rights has been the most prominent rallying cry for those who wish to discontinue MFN for China, there are a number of other issues that give Americans cause for concern: China's military adventurism, proliferation of missiles and nuclear technology, piracy of intellectual property, and unbalanced trade. These concerns are legitimate and are being addressed in varying degrees through diplomacy. The danger in the political debate over China is that the U.S. will try to use MFN, one of the fundamental principles of international trade, as a policy tool to advance unrelated economic, political, and security interests.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Revoking China's MFN status clearly is not an effective way to advance these interests. Certainly, China's bullying of Taiwan with missile tests interfered with international air and sea lanes and had the potential to draw the U.S. into military conflict with the PRC.<sup>10</sup>  It also put at risk peace and stability in Asia as well as freedom of navigation -- two of the three historical U.S. interests in Asia. However, revoking MFN would do nothing to stop these provocative acts. Nor would it improve the prospects for peace and stability or freedom of navigation generally. But it would violate the U.S. interest in free access to markets and free trade. Thus, while revoking MFN will affect neither China's position on human rights nor its intimidation of Taiwan, it certainly will violate a vital U.S. economic interest.
<p>

<b>Policy Solutions That Fit Policy Problems</b>

<p><b>Human Rights.</b> Rather than revoke MFN, the U.S. should craft a policy that deals as directly as possible with the source of the problem. On human rights, for example, the U.S. has been following a pattern of publicly demonizing China's leaders and then trying to negotiate quietly with these leaders for release of high-profile political prisoners and changes in PRC law. The problem with this approach is that by threatening and demonizing the PRC government, the U.S. cuts off access to those whom Americans seek to help. This tactic does not leave Chinese leaders in the mood to find consensus on these issues, and by focusing attention on a few high-profile dissidents, the U.S. risks being viewed by the Chinese people as caring only for a few superstars while ignoring the interests of the many ordinary people.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

There is a more effective way to address human rights concerns in China. The U.S. should create a positive public relationship with China's leaders while vigorously raising these legitimate moral concerns in private. To reach the people Americans seek to help, the U.S. could send more volunteers and supplies to provide direct assistance to China's orphans and poor. The U.S. also should seek to increase as much as possible people-to-people contact between the two countries, whether through business or education, to increase cross-fertilization of cultural values and understanding.

<p><b>Weapons Proliferation.</b> The U.S. intelligence community has reported Chinese sales of nuclear technology to Pakistan and nuclear capable missiles to Pakistan and Iran. The Administration is required to confirm these reports and to determine whether such transactions violate U.S. law and international agreements such as the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.<sup>11</sup>  If violations of U.S. law and international agreements are confirmed, the U.S. is obliged to invoke sanctions against China. While the Clinton Administration has threatened to impose sanctions, it has yet to determine officially whether actual violations have occurred. In addition, the threatened sanctions would only take funding away from American-run projects and would have little effect on China, as European and Japanese competitors would immediately fill the void.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The more effective approach to curbing China's proliferation problems is to work through the multilateral dispute resolution mechanisms within the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Unilateral enforcement of U.S. law, while justified if violations are confirmed, may not have the intended effect on China's behavior. Non-proliferation is an area in which cooperation with treaty partners and allies is not only critical, but also possible. A security threat is much more likely to produce international cooperation than is an economic or trade issue. Without the support of Europe and Japan, any sanction will quickly be undercut and rendered ineffective. Thus, to maximize the likelihood of success, it is important for the U.S. to have its allies' support in dealing with China, working as much as possible through the mechanisms built into international non-proliferation treaties and regimes. 

<p><b>Selling Pirated Goods.</b> With regard to intellectual property rights, officials in the U.S. software, motion picture, and computer industries have accused dozens of factories in China's southern Guangdong Province of illegally copying U.S. products and selling the pirated goods abroad. These officials estimate the damage to their industries in lost sales at $2.3 billion. In 1992, in 1995, and again in 1996, China signed agreements with the U.S. Trade Representative promising to crack down on these pirates. In May 1996, in an effort to motivate Chinese enforcement of its agreements, the U.S. Trade Representative threatened to impose sanctions totaling $2 billion on Chinese textile exports from Guangdong Province.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Indirect sanctions on textile manufacturers in Guangdong Province, while consistent with the spirit of enforcing the rule of law, do not address the source of the problem. Many of these illegal compact disk producers are operated solely or jointly by Taiwan and Hong Kong businessmen, and some have ties to organized crime. Thus, the U.S. cannot hope to press China alone to deal effectively with this problem. Only a carefully planned, well organized cooperative effort by the PRC, ROC, Hong Kong, and U.S. governments can possibly be successful.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

There is a more effective way for the U.S. to address the piracy problem. If American companies can locate these illegal manufacturers, they should also be able to identify the shipping container in which the pirated goods are packaged for export. With the consent of PRC and Hong Kong officials, once the container is identified, port authorities in Hong Kong can locate and seize the pirated goods that are targeted for export markets. Seizing the goods would affect the perpetrators but very few others, unlike indirect sanctions which, like a swinging axe, harm many in the hope of punishing the guilty few. In addition, international markets serviced by Hong Kong's exporters are the appropriate target. China's own consumers lack sufficient computer and audio hardware to generate the sustained demand necessary to make these pirates profitable.

<b>EIGHT REASONS TO CONTINUE MFN FOR CHINA</b>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Since MFN is so fundamental to U.S. global commercial strategy, there are several reasons why the U.S. should continue to extend it to China. Revoking MFN for China would:<ul>

<p><li><b>Harm American workers.</b> In 1995, the U.S. exported over $12 billion in goods and services to China. American trade with China supports over 200,000 high-wage American jobs, as well as tens of thousands of additional American jobs in U.S. ports, retail establishments, and consumer goods companies. The loss of exports from the inevitable Chinese retaliation against MFN revocation would seriously threaten the employment of these Americans.

<p><li><b>Threaten U.S. business and investment.</b> The International Monetary Fund estimates that China is now the world's third-largest economy after the United States and Japan, and could emerge as the world's largest economy in the 21st century. The World Bank has calculated China that will require nearly $750 billion in new industrial infrastructure over the next decade. China needs new aircraft, power generators, telecommunications, computers, and other high-skill, high-wage technologies that must be supplied from overseas. American companies are poised to get the contracts to build these projects. Continued American leadership in these key technology sectors is vital to sustaining long-term U.S. economic growth and creating high-wage, high-skill American jobs. If MFN is revoked, China's needs will be filled by Japanese and European business and investment, with American jobs lost to overseas competitors.

<p><li><b>Jeopardize economic reform in China.</b> The last 15 years of economic reform in China have increased economic freedom and improved the livelihood of 25 percent of the world's population. American companies operating in China have contributed to a significant expansion of economic freedom and choice for the Chinese people. The U.S. must build on this foundation to open China's economy and society even more. MFN will not guarantee the rise of democracy in China, but does it keep China open to influences and pressures from the outside world. It fosters the development of a middle class and a civil society that in the future will have the means and the will to demand more responsiveness from its government.

<p><li><b>Damage the economies of Taiwan and Hong Kong.</b> The prosperity of both Taiwan and Hong Kong depends to a significant degree on investment and export production in China. The revocation of MFN would cut Hong Kong's economic growth in half. Although this point is rarely discussed, billions of dollars in Taiwanese investment and labor-intensive industries have moved to the mainland, unabated by the recent tensions. Many of the light industrial goods on which Taiwan's economic miracle depends are now produced on the mainland and exported through Hong Kong to the United States and other markets. Threats of across-the-board tariff increases, MFN revocation, and boycotting of Chinese goods ignore the fact that many of the goods marked "Made in China" actually are produced by companies based in Hong Kong and Taiwan, both friends of the U.S.

<p><li><b>Not improve human rights conditions in China.</b> History shows that China oppresses its people far more during periods of isolation. This clearly was the case in the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s. Human rights improvement is a long-term process that requires U.S. attention, but also U.S. patience. It is a process that does not lend itself to annual review. Nevertheless, Taiwan's success in improving the economic and political well-being of its citizens demonstrates that this transition is both possible and desirable in a Chinese society.

<p><li><b>Not encourage China to adhere to international limitations on transfers of nuclear technology or weapons of mass destruction.</b> China should answer the charges that it is supplying Pakistan with key nuclear and missile components in violation of its commitments to the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Administration must investigate these allegations and, if such sales have taken place, apply sanctions as required by U.S. law. The law, however, needs to be changed. These sanctions, if not waived by the President, should be targeted specifically on the responsible Chinese enterprise rather than indiscriminately on all U.S.-financed projects in China as the law requires. Revoking MFN would go even further than the sanctions called for under current law, adversely affecting all U.S. commercial interaction with China. In the past, China has shown its displeasure with America's overtures to Taiwan or criticism of China's human rights record by selling dangerous technology to unstable regimes. Revoking MFN could generate another series of sales. In the area of non-proliferation, MFN is the wrong tool.

<p><li><b>Unnecessarily set the U.S. on the road to prolonged confrontation with China.</b> Abandoning MFN for China would make it less likely that China would integrate into the international system in a way that is favorable to U.S. interests. For the United States to realize its policy objectives most effectively, Beijing should not be an enemy. If U.S. policymakers wish to see China behave in a way that is consistent with international norms and agreements, they should work for multilateral cooperation with allies rather than engage in ineffective bilateral browbeating. How best to promote China's integration into the international commercial and security system will be among the most important challenges for American foreign policy in the foreseeable future. It warrants more deliberation and care from the President, his administration, and Congress.

<p><li><b>Violate a U.S. interest in free trade and a more open China.</b> The term "MFN" is misleading and should be changed. "General trading status" (GTS) would be a good alternative. Together with national treatment, MFN is a fundamental principle by which the World Trade Organization operates. It is normal trade status granted to all but a handful of countries -- North Korea, Cuba, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam -- none of which has any substantial global trade. It is the foundation of basic international commercial relations, and in the absence of the Cold War strategic framework, commercial relations are now the foundation of U.S.-China relations. Revoking MFN means seriously undercutting America's relationship with China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

For more than a century, U.S. policy has aimed at free access to the markets of Asia. For over half a century, the U.S. has labored to build and strengthen the current liberal international system of trade. In addition to being consistent with these long-term U.S. interests, MFN trade status for China demonstrates American goodwill to the people of China, if not to the government, by extending the U.S. system of free enterprise to raise their living standards and increase their economic freedoms and choices.</ul>
<p>

<b>THE CLINTON RECORD ON CHINA</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	The President should never have threatened revocation of MFN over human rights concerns when neither he nor the country was prepared to pay the cost of such action. The Secretary of State, ignoring congressional and public interest, should not have assured Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui would not be granted entry into the United States only days before the visa was granted. Similarly, Administration officials should not have equivocated, delayed, and apologized for action taken in support of U.S. interests in Taiwan. Each of these blunders severely damaged U.S. credibility in dealing with China and created a negative bilateral environment that renders the correct policies ineffective.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Administration says one thing but does another. It has managed the relationship with China badly. The Chinese are told that the Administration is following a policy of engagement. Engagement, however, is not a policy; it is simply another word for diplomacy. The U.S. needs engagement -- and diplomacy -- with a purpose. The Clinton Administration now lacks such a purpose. The purpose of U.S. policy toward China should be to communicate to Chinese leaders that China's interests will be served best by integrating into the international system, observing its norms and standards, and pursuing peace and stability in Asia in ways that are commensurate with the interests of the U.S. and China's Asian neighbors.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

To deliver this message, President Clinton needs to meet personally with Chinese leaders. The President received Gerry Adams and Yasser Arafat in the White House, but forced the PRC head of state to meet instead in New York without the fanfare of a full state visit. This message is not lost on the Chinese leadership, and the mere promise of frequent high-level summits to take place in a second Clinton Administration, as proposed by Secretary of State Warren Christopher this May in New York, is little consolation. Frequent face-to-face interaction between the leaders of the United States and China at the highest levels is critical for the protection of American interests in Asia. This interaction should take place in both capitals and in a formal setting that reflects the importance the U.S. attaches to achieving these American interests through cooperation.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

This strategy is the best way to make progress on areas of concern to the United States. Americans frustrated with the lack of progress in China on human rights, missile proliferation, or intellectual property rights, instead of more promises, need a clear, consistent, and predictable China policy to avoid miscalculation in the Taiwan Strait and to make progress on these issues.

<p>
<b>TOWARD A CHINA POLICY THAT WORKS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	There is much that can be done to work more effectively toward American goals in Asia. China's cooperation in areas which do not conflict with its own interests will make U.S. efforts easier and less costly. There is little chance of charting a policy course that follows common interests without regular and consistent communication, at the highest levels, of what each county's objectives and vital interests are in bilateral and regional relations. To create an environment more conducive to an effective policy toward China, the U.S. should:<ul>

<p><li><b>Renew China's MFN status.</b> This is the right decision and should be supported by the Congress. MFN promotes the U.S. interest in free access to Asian markets and provides Americans with greater opportunity to act as an influence for good within China.
<p><li><b>Invite China's President Jiang Zemin to the White House for a full state visit.</b> There is little reason to think that China is fated to become an enemy of the United States. It could happen, but the chances are reduced by dealing directly with China and by maintaining American strength. This is a gesture that could demonstrate that the U.S. is truly "engaged" with a purpose.

<p><li><b>Follow a more broad-based strategy toward Asia</b> The U.S. should avoid putting too many eggs in the China market basket. Rather than confronting China directly, the U.S. should seek to expand investment and trade with India and Indonesia. Both countries are very populous, and both are seeking foreign investment to improve their infrastructure and sustain a high rate of economic growth. Knowing that the U.S. has credible alternatives to the China market, China's leaders will no longer be able to take American involvement as a given.

<p><li><b>Use policy tools better suited to the problem.</b> China must obey the rules of the road in international commerce and security. It is right for the U.S. to seek the enforcement of U.S. law and international agreements, but it should use the dispute resolution mechanisms built into the relevant international regime or apply the recourse outlined in the bilateral agreement or U.S. law that has been violated. The remedy should target as specifically as possible the source of the problem and not cut too broadly across the spectrum of competing American interests in China, Asia, or the world.

<p><li><b>Repeal or amend the Jackson-Vanik Amendment.</b> The Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the 1974 Trade Act is outdated. The Soviet Union, Jackson-Vanik's primary target, exists no more, and China is no longer dominated by international communism. It is even becoming difficult to say that China's is a nonmarket economy. In addition, the amendment's freedom of emigration requirements are inappropriate for China. If China were to permit or encourage free emigration, what countries would be prepared or willing to accept tens or hundreds of millions of Chinese migrants?  Certainly the U.S. would not be willing to accept them. The already strained U.S. immigration and welfare system would be overwhelmed by the vast numbers of Chinese people seeking greater opportunity in America.</ul>
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The question of whether to continue China's MFN status is once again before the Congress. As Members take this opportunity to assess U.S.-China relations, they should replace the mixed signals sent by the Clinton Administration with a consistent strategy for promoting America's long-term interests in Asia. Because of its size and rate of growth, China will have an enormous impact for good or for ill on U.S. interests. Therefore, it is prudent to improve the management of this critical relationship and to seek China's cooperation before forcing the American and Chinese people to pay the enormous security and economic costs of revoking MFN.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The MFN debate unfortunately is caught up in two mistaken beliefs: 1) that MFN is privileged treatment and 2) that revoking MFN would be an effective way to force a favorable change in China's behavior. These beliefs have no basis in reality. Conditioning or revoking MFN under current circumstances would eliminate any possibility of cooperation from Beijing, rendering the U.S. less effective in its efforts to limit transfers of nuclear technology and weapons of mass destruction, correct unfair trade practices, and foster development of the rule of law in Asia. Moreover, discontinuing MFN would not improve social and commercial conditions in China but would come at great cost to Americans and their friends in Hong Kong and Taiwan. For the U.S., revoking or conditioning MFN gains too little and risks too much. For these and many other reasons, most-favored-nation trade status for China should be renewed unconditionally.

<h3>CHINA: FRIEND OR ENEMY?</h3>

<b>By The Honorable Barbara Hackman Franklin</b>
<P>Barbara Hackman Franklin is the former U.S. Secretary of Commerce, and spoke at <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, on June 20, 1996.
<p>
	China has always held a special fascination for Westerners. This vast, populous country is thought by many to have the oldest culture on Earth. Certainly it was the center of Eastern civilization. China was already a sophisticated society when Marco Polo traveled there in the 14th century, bringing back such treasures as silk, tea, spices, noodles, fireworks, exquisite porcelain, jade, and wood block printing.
<p>	But our captivation with China has not translated into a smooth and predictable relationship over the past few centuries. To us, China has been alternately open, then closed, and then reopened again. The result is that we Americans do not understand China very well--its ancient roots, its history, its people, its way of life, political structure, or place in today's world. Nor do the Chinese understand us. To them, the West has seemed imperialistic and exploitive, caught up with colonial designs on their territory and disrespectful of China as a great nation.
<p>	But it is imperative--even urgent--that we learn to understand each other better. I believe the U.S.-China relationship is one of the most important--perhaps the most important--of all the bilateral strategic relationships in the world today and that we have reached a defining moment in that relationship.
<p>
<b>China's Place in the World Today</b>
<p>	Today, China is a country in transition. Much change is occurring, and it is occurring at a phenomenal pace.
	<p>This was brought home to me forcefully when President Bush sent me to China in December of 1992 to normalize commercial relations that had been disrupted with the imposition of sanctions on China after the crackdown at Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. I was the first Cabinet Secretary to visit the country officially since that sad day, and my mission removed one of the sanctions--the one prohibiting ministerial contacts between our two governments. Together, my then counterpart, Minister of Foreign Economics and Trade Li Lanqing (now Vice Premier), and I reconvened the nearly moribund Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade. In addition, $1 billion worth of new contracts for U.S. companies were signed, and much additional business followed.
<p>	During this trip, I saw firsthand the hunger of the Chinese for prosperity, their intense desire to move quickly into the ranks of the world's strongest economies, and the fervor with which they were applying themselves to achieving this goal. Since that trip in December of 1992, I have been back to China regularly. Each time, I am struck again by the rapid progress the Chinese are making toward this objective.
<p>	Of course, the path of dramatic change is never smooth; semi-controlled chaos might be one way to describe it. Nor is such change always clearly discernible to those outside the country. But the outcome in China has tremendous significance for us in the United States, for the whole of Asia, and indeed for the rest of the world. There are many reasons why.<ul>
	<p><li>China is an emerging great power. It is the world's most populous country--1.2 billion people.
	<p><li>It is strategically positioned as the geographic center of Asia. China shares a border with 14 different countries. It has more common borders than any other country in the world.
	<p><li>China has the world's largest standing army, and it holds one of the seven permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. This means that China has a voice in-- and a veto over--the decisions made by this organization.
	<p><li>Finally--and most importantly, given my view of the world today that economic concerns are primary drivers of global politics--we now have China's growing economic clout. China's economy is the fastest-growing large economy in the world. The World Bank already ranks China as the third-largest economy in the world behind the United States and Japan. Predictions are that China's economy will grow somewhere between 8 and 10 percent this year, and economists expect China's economy to continue growing at least 6 to 8 percent annually for the foreseeable future. That means China is well on the way to becoming the world's largest economy within the next 15 years.
	<p><li>China is the largest market in the world for aircraft, for telephones, for construction equipment, for agricultural products, and increasingly for consumer goods. The country needs virtually everything we produce and sell. And demand is growing rapidly. In cities like Shenzhen in the south of China, the first of the Special Economic Zones created by Deng Xiaoping's reform drive, one can stand on the street corner and feel the dynamism and the energy as the Chinese people build another Hong Kong. The same can be said for Shanghai, reportedly sporting nearly 25 percent of the world's cranes, or Tianjin or Zhuhai. The whirlwind pace of growth and change is awe-inspiring.</ul><p>
	Now for the flip side.<p>
	Despite the dynamic economic growth, GDP per capita in China is only about $300. Some parts of China, especially in the north and the west, have not yet been touched by the freedom of the Special Economic Zones and are still very poor. In contrast, GDP per capita is much greater--probably far higher than $300--for people living along the coast and in the south of China, where the change has been the greatest.
<p>
<b>China--A Place of Contradictions</b><p>
	China today is, in some ways, hard to describe. Contradictions abound, starting with the government's self-description of the country as a "socialist market economy." Such contradictions pop up constantly as the leadership tries to put a Communist rationale and a Chinese face on activities that would make Karl Marx turn over in his grave.
	<p>China today is not a police state like Stalin's Russia; nor is there the indiscriminate violence and intolerance of the Cultural Revolution. But neither is it a democracy. There is a ruling elite in Beijing, but the central government is no longer as powerful as it once was. The provinces are flexing their muscles, and some officials are candid about wanting "Beijing off our backs." Besides the greater economic freedoms in China today, there is greater mobility, the beginnings of better job opportunities, greater tolerance for and interest in education, and greater freedom of discussion.
<p>	China is governed by a collective leadership in Beijing. Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader, is still alive but not active in governing. His hand-picked successor, President and General Secretary Jiang Zemin, seems to have consolidated his power for the near term. But his word is not law; he must gain consensus among the others in the collective leadership. That is sometimes difficult and makes for erratic reactions, arrogant posturing, slow decisions, or no decisions on occasion.
<p>	Some people seem to believe that when Deng finally passes away there will be a great skirmish for power. I think not. I think the post-Deng era has already begun and that the collective leadership will stay in place at least for awhile.
<p>	One indicator of the course China may take in the near future will come within the next year to 18 months. Premier Li Peng is due to move out of the premiership, according to Party rules, and the Party Congress will choose his replacement. Who the Congress chooses could be an important signal. Much jockeying is going on now behind the scenes. From the U.S. perspective, the best choice would be someone committed to reform and familiar with the United States to replace the more nationalistic Li Peng.
<p>	Longer term, the real questions are: Will the Communist Party continue to enjoy legitimacy among the populace? Will it continue to satisfy the growing appetite for prosperity? Will there be another paramount leader, such as Deng and Mao? Or will China have opened up too much for one person to be able to command so much respect and power? And if there is no paramount leader, will a collective leadership survive? If not, what form will the leadership structure take, and how will the leadership be chosen? Or will China regress? Will there be a leadership change by force? What role might the military play?
<p>	History is little help to us here. Despite the tendency of China to have "paramount leaders" throughout its long civilization, the paradigm has changed significantly, thanks to the new economic freedoms, the march of technology, instantaneous communication globally, and a more closely integrated world.
<p>	Within China, the central government and the provinces are attempting to deal with myriad problems and issues. They are working now with the Ninth Five Year Plan. This one stresses a number of goals, including strengthening China's agriculture and bringing prosperity to the rural economy; creating infrastructure and building basic industries to address such needs as water conservation, greater energy production, and reliable communications; promoting science and technology; reforming state enterprises; expanding education; and moving toward a rule of law.
<p>	A big concern is the migration of people from rural areas to the cities in search of prosperity with the attendant possibility of social unrest. There are potential shortages of water and of oil. There is corruption. There is pollution. And these are just a few of the challenges and obstacles confronting China's leadership today.
<p>	What happens in China will bear close watching. I believe the drive to free the economy may well be irreversible. The Chinese people want prosperity and material things. They want to get rich. Political freedom and democracy seem not to be at the top of most people's agendas--prosperity is. Perhaps as material needs are better met, the Chinese people's desires will change. We will just have to see.
	<p>However, I believe that the U.S. posture toward China and the tone of the U.S.-China governmental relationship can have an influence on which way things go. It will also help determine whether China is an ally, a belligerent friend, or an enemy.
<p>
<b>The U.S.-China Relationship</b><p>
	Our relationship with China is anchored on three communiques, signed between 1972 and 1982, and the Taiwan Relations Act that was passed in 1979. The 1972 communique--the Shanghai Communique--was agreed to by President Richard Nixon and Chairman Mao Zedong. This was when the "one China" policy was first articulated. It has been the bedrock of the United States' diplomatic posture toward China ever since.
<p>	Currently, the relationship between our two governments is at the lowest point it has been in many years. It is characterized by distrust and misunderstanding on both sides. Let's just review what has happened since the Clinton Administration took over management of this critical relationship.
<p>	After charging President Bush with "coddling dictators" during the 1992 campaign, candidate Clinton changed his tune once he became President. Following an entertaining spectacle of dithering and public hand-wringing of the sort that has characterized this Administration, President Clinton adopted the very same "engagement" policy espoused by President Bush. Funny how one's perspective changes after one becomes the leader of the free world, isn't it?
<p>	The problem with President Clinton's change of heart and new policy began when the Administration didn't follow it. Three years later, the policy has become so muddled by ad hoc decisions and inconsistent actions that it is hard to ascertain what it is. And because of the mixed signals sent by Clinton and his Cabinet, many Chinese now have come to believe that our policy is the "containment" of China--an idea they deeply resent.
	<p>The big turnaround on President Clinton's part occurred during the 1994 annual battle over renewing most-favored-nation (MFN) status for China. The President announced that he would certify MFN renewal without the conditions regarding human rights that he had attached the preceding year. His decision was correct on the merits; trade and human rights should not be linked. Punishing trade does nothing to correct human rights abuses. But because the Administration made this decision unilaterally, without first gaining concessions on other trade issues from the Chinese, the policy change actually created confusion and caused the Chinese to think they had "won," that the Clinton Administration had backed down in the face of business pressure, and that they did not have to do anything else to satisfy the U.S. on trade. In fact, the Administration did give China a big victory--and got nothing in return.
<p>	Currently, from the Chinese perspective, the greatest obstacle to improving relations between our two countries probably is the question of Taiwan. One of the biggest flaps over this issue was sparked by something that to many here seemed rather unimportant--the granting of a visa to Lee Teng-hui, the President of Taiwan, in June of last year so that he could attend a reunion at Cornell University.
<p>	Again, this situation was badly handled. After promises had been made to China that such a visa would not be issued, President Clinton apparently changed his mind (what a surprise). He reversed this decision, thus pulling the rug out from under his own Secretary of State, who had made assurances to his counterpart, China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, that the visa would not be granted. Needless to say, Beijing reacted angrily and promptly recalled its ambassador. The decision to allow President Lee to visit the U.S. was interpreted by the Chinese as a violation of the spirit of the "one China" policy, and therefore an infringement on Chinese sovereignty. Sovereignty is a gut issue with the Chinese and has been ever since the "one China" policy was first articulated.
<p>	Another strain on the relationship was added earlier this year. Our country was incensed at the saber-rattling missile exercises and military maneuvers the Chinese  government carried out in the Taiwan Straits prior to the Taiwan elections. In response, the U.S. sent aircraft carriers to the region. Now, in the aftermath of the Taiwan election, tensions have been lowered, but some here in the United States are still distrustful of China's intentions toward Taiwan.
<p>Countless other examples could be cited to illustrate the inconsistency of U.S. policy, the mixed signals, and the escalating tensions which have characterized the Clinton Administration approach toward China. And although the two presidents have met on more than one occasion, they have not established anything that resembles a personal or a working relationship.
<p>
<b>Renewal of Most-Favored-Nation Trading Status-Again</b>
<p>	And now here we are again, debating the subject of most-favored-nation (MFN) renewal for China one more time. The annual discussion is under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974. The amendment denies MFN to any "non-market" economy which restricts free emigration unless the President makes the determination to waive the restrictions. This amendment was aimed originally at the USSR during the Cold War era. But in recent years, since Tiananmen Square, the annual MFN debate has become the vehicle through which a variety of discontents with China have been raised. This year is no different, except that the number of issues with China has increased.
<p>	The President has certified to Congress his desire to renew MFN without conditions. Senator Dole, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, has stated his strong pro-MFN position. The Republican leadership in Congress agrees. Now the action is with Congress, which has 60 days to debate and vote. Congress should concur with renewing MFN for China. Denying it or attaching unrelated conditions makes no sense.<ul>
	<p><li>First, the economic consequences would be profound. Denial of MFN would impede trade, raise tariffs, and make it more costly to do business in China. At least 170,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs were directly dependent on U.S. exports to China last year, and thousands of others in such areas as transportation and finance are indirectly linked. Denying MFN would slow China's reform progress as well.
	<p><li>Second, such action would send a negative message to the Asia-Pacific region, a place where some countries already are concerned that the United States is planning to withdraw despite the fact that our presence is viewed as critical to ensuring stability in that part of the world.
	<p><li>Third, denial of MFN to China would harm the economies of Hong Kong and Taiwan, the two largest investors in the mainland--and both places in which we have a considerable stake.
	<p><li>Finally, denial of MFN will not correct or erase any of the concerns we have with China, whether they be human rights, nuclear proliferation, anti-Taiwan saber-rattling, or something else. Seeking to punish China through this vehicle simply does not serve our national interest.</ul><p>
	Furthermore, I think the time has come, before MFN renewal comes up again next year, to make MFN for China permanent. After all, we accord permanent MFN status to most other countries, including some considered rogue states, such as Iraq and Libya. Our strategic and economic relationship with the world's most populous country is too important to continue engaging in an annual mud-wrestling event around this issue. Doing this means changing or repealing the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, an action that should be high on the agenda of the President and Congress next year.
<p>
<b>Challenges</b><p>
	There are challenges to getting this done. Many people have serious and very real concerns about China.<ul>
	<p><li>First, the issue of human rights, which has cropped up every year since the crackdown at Tiananmen Square, raises everyone's sympathy and creates outrage among all of us who value personal liberty and freedom. All of us flinch at the reports about the detention of some dissidents, Chinese methods of population control, and allegedly poor treatment of children at orphanages. Needless to say, we disagree with the way in which China deals with many of these matters, but using trade as a weapon to try to force the Chinese into adopting more respect for human rights is not the way to make progress.
	<p><li>Second, nuclear proliferation looms as a major worry. Intelligence reports over the past few years--some apparently substantiated, some not--indicate that China has shipped missile technology and parts to Pakistan and Iran. Most recently, allegations that China shipped ring magnets to Pakistan caused some people to claim that China had violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1994. This act calls for mandatory sanctions once a finding of violation has been made. Specifically, this means that the U.S. Export-Import Bank could not make or guarantee any loans for projects in China. The Administration recently declined to make such a finding, in exchange for China's assurance that it would strictly observe its obligations under the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
	<p>Once again, using trade as a weapon to address these concerns will not eliminate the problems. In addition, we have to question whether this sort of law punishes U.S. exports, and therefore U.S. jobs and well-being, more than it punishes the offending nation. This is a law which ought to be revised in the next Congress as well.
	<p><li>Third is the issue of intellectual property rights. A trade war was just averted on Monday by an 11th-hour finding by acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky that China had made substantial progress in complying with a 1995 agreement to protect intellectual property rights. The Administration had threatened sanctions if the Chinese did not take concrete steps to enforce the agreement; the Chinese had threatened to retaliate. So the good news is that we found that China had closed 15 factories that had been producing 30 to 50 million pirated CDs and videos yearly, shuttered six distribution centers, and instituted a ban on the importation of equipment needed to produce these products. The bad news is that this action does not solve the problem. It is a step in the right direction, but it is just a step and an incremental one at that. We are going to have to keep consistent pressure on the Chinese to continue making progress on the matter of safeguarding intellectual property rights until the rule of law is firmly established in China.
	<p><li>Fourth is another commercial dispute--our mounting trade deficit with China. The deficit, growing at nearly 20 percent annually in recent years, could reach nearly $40 billion this year. The worry is that China's market is still too closed and that U.S. jobs are disappearing to places around the world, like China, where labor is much cheaper.
	<p><li>Fifth is the question of Taiwan. Some Taiwan advocates want to punish China for the recent saber-rattling and for other things. Despite this--maybe even because of it--President Lee Teng-hui won handily, making Taiwan a shining example of economic freedom leading to political freedom. The United States does indeed have commitments to Taiwan, and we should honor them. But we need to be careful not to overstep and involve ourselves in the Beijing-Taipei debate when we have no reason to be there. It should be noted that the Independence Party candidate garnered barely 20 percent of the vote in the March election.
	<p><li>Then there is Hong Kong, which reverts to China on June 30 next year. How Beijing handles this situation will be viewed by many as a precursor to the way in which reunification with Taiwan, if it is to occur, would be handled. Already Beijing is making many people uneasy with such actions as announcing its intention to close down the Hong Kong Legislative Council and replace it with another body and issuing confusing statements about its intentions to respect freedom of the press in Hong Kong.
	<p><li>Finally, another strategic concern is the intentions of China's military. Some people also worry that U.S. products now sold in China could be diverted for military uses.</ul><p>
	Finding ways to deal with all of these very tough issues in a constructive manner is the challenge before us today.
	<p>One interesting obstacle to getting this done is posed by the fact that the majority of the American people are viewing China through an old stereotype. They either envision a Stalinist-type police state or think of peasants and water buffalo in rice paddies. Part of the challenge for those in China--and I believe there are many--who want to have a better relationship with the United States is to make Americans understand how China is changing and what the Chinese people want in their future.
<p>
<b>The Future</b><p>
	So where do we want our relationship with China to go from here? <p>
	Currently, the U.S. policy--or, more accurately, non-policy--is fraught with inconsistencies. This has led to confusion on the part of the Chinese about what we really mean. They, in turn, often behave in ways that we have difficulty understanding, and seem sometimes to be both arrogant and paranoid.
<p>	The business relationships, however, between the two countries are much more cordial and productive. That is good and it is hopeful.
<p>	However, the tension in the governmental relationship can and does negatively affect some commercial activity. Every time tensions increase, there are large projects which are held up. Some contracts U.S. firms hope to get go to other countries. The approval of licenses and branches, particularly in the financial services area, has slowed. All of this creates a climate of uncertainty and heightens the risk for American businesses.
<p>	There is one clear example of where Administration policy, which some think politically motivated in this election year, has hurt U.S. business prospects: the enormous Three Gorges Dam project, which the Chinese have been talking about for 50 years. Administration objections to this project on environmental grounds have caused the Export-Import Bank to announce that it will not help finance U.S. companies bidding on the project.
	<p>None of this helps our overall relationship with China. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the Administration to get its act together and make every effort to improve the bilateral relationship. The President and the executive branch must do it. Congress has a say, but Congress is not empowered or equipped to manage foreign relations day to day.
<p>	Engagement with China is the right policy. But the policy must be more than just words. Consistent actions speak far louder than words.
<p>	What we urgently need is a strategic framework for our relationship. This does not mean that we are going to be soft on China. It does mean that we have to define a clear set of goals, objectives, and expectations for our relationship and clearly articulate this to the Chinese. And they must have the opportunity to do the same. This is what has been missing from our relationship for the past three-and-a-half years. We must have a meaningful dialogue at the highest levels in order to push for what we want to achieve.
<p>	In putting this framework in place, we should concentrate first on areas where we have common interests and some agreement. The commercial sector is a good place to start.
	<p>Currently, thousands of U.S. companies are doing business in China. That number has increased significantly between my mission in 1992 and now. U.S. companies have about $26 billion invested in China, making the United States the third-largest investor after Hong Kong and Taiwan. Eighty percent of this investment was made since 1992. And, of course, the U.S. has considerable investment in Hong Kong as well--$12 billion at last count. In fact, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong is the largest AmCham in the world.
<p>	The U.S. needs to work with the Chinese to bring about increased market access; to enforce intellectual property rights--a crucial issue for us; to reduce the overemphasis the Chinese government currently places on technology transfer and exporting by investor companies; and to help bring about a consistent rule of law.
<p>	The U.S. also needs to work with China to bring that country into the World Trade Organization (WTO) on reasonable terms. We need to help find a way around the current impasse: that China claims to be a developing country while we maintain she is not because of the clout associated with her sheer size. It is in our interest to have China join the WTO, on acceptable terms; that way, we could pursue our trade agenda multilaterally and would have added support for getting China to conform to the rules governing world trade.
<p>	Let me digress a moment and comment further on that. I think the Clinton Administration generally has been too unilateral in its approach to trade and often has been too knee-jerk confrontational in its style--a style which has not achieved results commensurate with its bluster. I suggest that we change our approach to trade negotiating. We should concentrate on a desired objective and then decide which tools and which negotiating style will best achieve the results we want. Talking tough to win political points at home is hardly a rational trade policy.
<p>	I also believe that the Chinese want a peaceful, stable world. Their primary objective right now is to industrialize and spread prosperity throughout their land. Wars and conflicts divert resources from this objective. Here is another area where I believe there is room for us to work with the Chinese, on non-proliferation concerns as well as on other strategic issues.
<p>	For other matters about which we have had disagreements in the past, we could look for items where we have a common interest and where we could agree. In those places where we cannot agree, we should still maintain a dialogue and make every effort to manage these problems.
<p>	Some predict the U.S. and China will become enemies over time. This is, of course, possible. But if it occurs, and I hope it does not, let us hope our policies--or lack thereof--do not contribute to such an outcome. Instead, our vision of the U.S.-China relationship ought to be rooted in making allies and friends of the Chinese. Withdrawing or doing nothing is simply not an option. An American presence is critical to maintaining a balance in Asia. Thus, the United States must remain engaged, both militarily and economically, in that part of the world.
<p>	We must keep in mind, too, that many in China are concerned about the deteriorating relationship with the U.S. Despite what we might think some days, the Chinese people admire America. They covet our products and much about our way of life. This is underscored by the fact that so many of them want to come here and send their children here to school.
<p>	Much work needs to be done to repair the U.S.-China relationship. The best way to promote progress is to stay engaged, to encourage China's economic reform and integration into the world community. To do this, we need to exercise the best diplomatic judgment and skills, to disagree with the Chinese when we must, be tough-minded when necessary, but do so in the context of fostering an important friendship. We need to encourage, cajole, and coax the Chinese forward instead of blustering, threatening, and shouting at them in public as the Clinton Administration has been doing. Above all, we need to treat our Chinese friends as we would any other friends: with dignity and fairness.
<p>	The road will not be easy. The Chinese, caught up in the process of great change, at times will be difficult. They will do things we do not agree with. We need to handle these matters in the context of our broader objective.
<p>	China has made astonishing progress in the past 17 years. If that progress toward economic reforms, prosperity, and a general opening up of the country continues for the next 17 years, China will indeed be perceived as a great power. The American people need to learn this. They must become better educated and more aware of what is going on in China today.
<p>	We cannot turn our back on the possibility of helping free markets and democracy along in China. If we are short-sighted and fail to adopt a long-term vision about our relationship, if we continue our current schizophrenic approach to China policy, who knows what direction change could take? The U.S. and the world cannot afford to take this risk.

<h3> ENTERING THE PACIFIC CENTURY</h3></p>
<p><b>By Senator Jesse Helms</b></p>
<p>
The Second Annual B.C. Lee Lecture, given March 26, 1996<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are many great self-declared institutions in Washington. Some profess to have decided impacts on America's foreign policy. Then there are others truly making significant contributions; these are substantially fewer. <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/allen.htm">Richard Allen</a> are among the most significant players behind these few institutions -- but more about them in a moment.
<p>
<table border=0><tr><td><img src="lect562.gif" align=left width=277 height=196></td></tr><tr><td><font size="-1"><b>Heritage President Ed Feulner, center, introduces<br>
 Sen. Helms to Jay Lee, grandson of the late <br>
B.C. Lee, founder of the Samsung Group</td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage Foundation was in its infancy in the early 1970s during my first years in the Senate. But it had by then already become "self-evident," as one of our greatest documents puts it, that Heritage was moving rapidly in its remarkable leadership with its advocacy of, and its support for, great principles that deserve to survive.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
History will appropriately record the enormously important role that Ed Feulner has played in restoring and preserving the meaning and the miracle of America. And Richard V. Allen, who is so highly respected in this city and far beyond, has made the difference on countless occasions and in countless matters when America's future was hanging in the balance. Richard Allen and Ed Feulner together founded the Asian Studies Center in 1983, and Mr. Allen has served as its chairman ever since.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I mention all of this in paying my respects to these two patriots, and to thank them, and you, for the honor of having been chosen to offer my remarks at this second annual B.C. Lee lecture for the Heritage Foundation. And let me also take just a moment to recognize in this distinguished company my good friend and colleague, Representative Benjamin Gilman, the Chairman of the House International Relations Committee.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The year 1983 didn't appear to have the rosy glow foretelling the dawn of the Pacific Century. Leonid Brezhnev had just died, the Soviet Union was in turmoil, and the United States was fighting the final battles of the Cold War. The Heritage Foundation was preoccupied with those and other pressing issues of the day, but it was also looking forward. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1983, as I have indicated, Heritage founded its Asian Studies Center, a reflection of its understanding of the vital role Asia was to play in the post-Cold War future. That forward-looking vision is the reason Heritage is today one of America's preeminent think tanks, a policy center on which I and many other Members of Congress rely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In identifying the 21st century as the Pacific Century, I am merely stating the obvious: During the past decade, the world's center of gravity has shifted. And it will continue to move eastward away from Europe, toward Asia, because as the nations of Eastern Europe and the states of the former Soviet Union were struggling to break free of communism, Pacific Rim nations were busily taking care of business at home.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Their hard work has paid off. The Asia-Pacific region currently accounts for more than 40 percent of the world's trade and U.S.-Pacific Rim trade has out paced trade across the Atlantic. Thankfully for the United States -- though the political and economic center of gravity may have shifted West to East, Europe to Asia -- we remain uniquely positioned, not only geographically, but strategically, politically, and economically at the center. The United States thus remains the world's anchor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And that is where we must stay. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The fall of the Berlin Wall forced the United States to reexamine its role in the world. There were some who believed that the end of the Cold War was the time to turn inward, to spend a little time with our own problems. Others argued that the U.S. is the only country in the world with the moral, economic, and strategic strength to bring the rest of the world along. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am convinced that we cannot be the best nation in the world unless we are willing to lead the world. We cannot lead by being the world's policeman, nor the world's babysitter, but by being what we have been for most of the 20th century -- the standard-bearer of moral, political, and military might and right, an example towards which all others aspire.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Congress, U.S. alliances in the Pacific enjoy bipartisan support. Some of us focus on political alliances, others on economic, others on strategic, and still others on moral alliances. But all of us recognize that those alliances need strengthening. The question is how to prioritize our objectives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But, first, what are our priorities?  Clearly, one reason the United States has seemed to be flailing around in the world, rushing from disaster to disaster, is because the Clinton Administration has failed to set priorities. Everything, from Burundi to Bosnia, is equally important -- and, therefore, equally unimportant. Our old allies in Europe are watching us and wondering with amazement where the United States is headed. And you can bet that our new allies in Asia are scratching their heads, too.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In just a few short years, the Clinton Administration has managed to warp U.S.-Asia policy so badly that, at any one time, the United States is at odds with China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula. Right now, many Asian nations fear that we are propelling ourselves down the road to irrelevance. And we're not just strolling either.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In China, the United States has neither a strategy, nor resolve, for dealing with areas of key interests to the United States On the Korean peninsula, this Administration has given lip service to our allies in South Korea while dealing directly with the North Koreans on issues ranging from their nuclear program to the delivery of humanitarian food aid. Food aid, for heaven's sakes, that North Korea demanded, while South Korea -- our friend and ally -- was insisting the North did not need.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If this State Department, this National Security Council, and this White House, are determined to continue their experiments in foreign policy, let us pray that they will not make the devastating mistake of delegating decision-making to our enemies of forty years, the North Koreans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States simply cannot afford to abdicate its role in the dominant region of the 21st century. We must have priorities, and we must stand up for them. And, yes, if and when necessary, fight for them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Setting our priorities is no easy business. Asia presents daunting challenges. Consider the following:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Communist China considers itself prepared to step into the role of a dominant world power, yet demonstrates time and again that it has neither the maturity nor the decency to handle the role;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
North Korea maintains its million-man army and its militant, anti-Western propaganda machine while the United States props up North Korea's failing economy through a faulty agreement;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Meanwhile Taiwan's dedication to democracy and capitalism deserves our continued support -- politically and militarily -- even in the face of severe opposition from Mainland China; 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Southeast Asians, proud of their continued economic miracles, are nervous about the Chinese military modernization and territorial claims in the South China Sea and are therefore pushing the ASEAN alliance into a strategic alliance, as well as an economic one; and
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India and Pakistan, like two caged tigers, compete for nuclear weaponry and missile technology, all the while scratching at their wounds in Kashmir. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But China is the greatest challenge. China is still trying to figure out how to play its own role on the world stage. In the meantime, the United States cannot be hamstrung by China's confusion. The United States must not sit still in the thrall of an awakening dragon. We must define U.S. interests in Asia now, as the dragon awakes, and hope that the dragon will awaken on the right side of the bed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Just three days ago, in Taiwan, the world watched as the free Taiwanese people cast their ballots in the first democratic presidential election ever in a Chinese-speaking country. President Lee Teng-hui scored a decisive victory in a hotly contested election. All of us, of course, congratulate President Lee and applaud his vision for Taiwan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Think about it for a moment: In 1979, when the Carter Administration callously cut formal ties with our long-time ally, Taiwan, it was the Congress of the United States that compelled Mr. Carter to sign the Taiwan Relations Act -- the only law of the United States governing our relations with Taiwan. In passing the Taiwan Relations Act, Congress expressed its bipartisan support for Taiwan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The election of President Ronald Reagan guaranteed that the Taiwan Relations Act would be properly enforced to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself against any external threat. At that time, most countries in the world ignored Taiwan. And, like some in the United States, these same people assumed it was only a matter of time before the Communists on the mainland consumed tiny Taiwan. That hasn't happened, and it will not happen as long as I am in the U.S. Senate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s, the Reagan and Bush Administrations followed a consistent, principled policy toward Taiwan. It was not the least bit ambiguous. During this period, the people of Taiwan persisted. They accelerated the rate of growth in their free market economy, attracted high technology manufacturers, raised their own living standards, and encouraged the establishment of democracy. Even the most vigorous supporters of the Taiwanese -- myself included -- would never have thought that kind of progress possible in such a short period, especially given the fact that the Communists in Red China fought them the whole way.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So where does Taiwan go from here?  Will the Communists continue to threaten and bluster, wielding their own military machine time and again against Taiwan?  Not if the United States plays the role it should.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First of all, Taiwan deserves to participate in international organizations. Taiwan trades with the world, freely and fairly. Taiwan has a thriving, free market economy and a sound currency. Taiwan meets the fundamental criteria for membership in the World Trade Organization and should be admitted now, regardless of Mainland China's admission timetable. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, the United States must continue a vigorous and faithful implementation of the Taiwan Relations Act and all of its provisions. The United States has promised, and is obligated by law, to provide Taiwan with enough military equipment to defend itself against any external threat. The recent military exercises in the Taiwan Strait orchestrated by the Chinese Communists prove this to be more important than ever. We can and should -- we must -- remove any supposed barriers to providing Taiwan with state-of-the-art defensive systems and equipment. Taiwan threatens no one; the same cannot be said of Mainland China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Third, we must actively engage other countries in the region to encourage and assist Taiwan's peaceful democratic growth. It will be Taiwan's economic growth upon which other economies in the region will come to rely. It is those countries that should be encouraged to support Taiwan on the political front as well. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fourth, to ensure that we do not contradict our goal of encouraging Taiwan's economic growth in conditions of democracy, the United States must be exceptionally cautious concerning the technologies we sell to Communist China. The United States does not serve its own long-term interests well by augmenting Communist China's military capability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As for Mainland China, it has become an appalling habit in various U.S. administrations to speak to China as if to a child. We outline our expectations, and when they are not met -- and they are never met -- we make excuses. But the Chinese are not children, and we are not their parents. Respect for human life, willingness to obey international agreements -- these are U.S. priorities, not homework assignments. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Refusing to punish China when China does not live up to its commitments in the world only further encourages China's intransigence. Too often we don't follow through on sanctions because we worry that we will lose a share of the elusive Chinese market. But we are forgetting at least two things when we do that. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First, the Chinese need us as much as, if not more than, we need them. Chinese growth and continued prosperity are dependent on a continued stream of foreign investment and trade. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, we forget the beloved Asian tradition of bargaining. If we explain our bottom line and then don't follow through to defend it, they'll push us to an even lower bottom line the next time around. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Twice recently, the United States has backed away from sanctioning China for its bad behavior. The United States, under the steady direction of Mickey Kantor, vowed to sanction China if it did not implement the agreement that China signed more than a year ago regarding intellectual property rights protection. Shockingly to nobody, except perhaps Mr. Kantor, the Chinese didn't live up to the terms of the agreement. But, you see, the Chinese know us too well. They dangled a $4 billion bid for Boeing planes in return for our not imposing the sanctions on intellectual property.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More serious still than thieving brand-name sneakers are China's nefarious proliferation activities. In the face of China's transfer of strategically crucial missiles to one of the world's most destabilizing, terrorist nations, Iran, the Clinton Administration has sat on its hands. The Chinese play us well: They sign an agreement, violate it, and in return are awarded lucrative contracts with U.S. firms in which the U.S. firm is required to transfer important proprietary technology. What a deal.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
U.S. laws regarding sanctions for international trafficking in missiles and in weapons of mass destruction are clear. We disregard them at our own choosing -- and at our own peril.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The size of the Chinese market has blinded far too many to the Chinese threat. Military cadres in the Chinese leadership maintain a dominant role in the policymaking process. It is the generals, and not the apparatchiks, who enjoy a stranglehold over policy. It is they who have pushed China's drive to modernize its armed forces from a defensive, brown-water type to a blue-water force capable of forward deployment throughout Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By the end of the next decade, China will be capable of locking up the world's most strategic waterways. By reasserting its claims to atolls in the South China Sea and by selling billions of dollars in military hardware to the regime in Burma, while building shipping ports off the Burmese coast in the Indian Ocean, the Chinese are in a position to cut off the international right of free passage in those waters. One call from Beijing could very well cut off over 50 percent of the world's trade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Japanese, the Koreans, the Southeast Asians, and the South Asians all see the trend and, in response, are begging the United States to maintain the 7th Fleet in the region. U.S. military presence in the region is vital. If we're willing to use U.S. armed forces to build toilets and sewers for Haitians, there is no question we should bolster U.S. forces to defend and maintain right of passage through these crucial international maritime routes. We not only would insure our own economic well-being, but also would maintain stability in markets throughout the world. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clearly, the United States cannot shoulder the financial and logistical burden of defending Asia's waterways alone. In return for our services, the countries of the region are going to have to offer far more access and hospitality to our military.We will have to depend on our allies far more than we do now. Which brings me to the crucial role of the U.S.-Japan military alliance. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States and Japan, like it or not, share common goals and objectives for the Asia-Pacific. Our economies will come to depend upon the enormous economic growth in Asia -- a peaceful Asia, that is. The economic forces of an increasingly interdependent global economy and the strategic rise of China are hurtling the United States and Japan down the same path. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the United States is to attain its security objectives in Asia, the U.S.-Japan alliance must remain strong. However, our alliance with Japan has come under sharp scrutiny in recent months, and I am persuaded that the relationship must be reexamined -- not to determine whether it should continue, but how best it should continue.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, we must not fool ourselves. If the United States were to leave the Japanese to fend for themselves, I am convinced that Japan would go nuclear within ten years. It is entirely possible that within the course of the next century, the world may very well witness the development of a nuclear-armed Japan, a nuclear-armed and reunified Korean peninsula, a China with modern, forward-deployed armed forces, a still-divided and nuclear-armed South Asia and an arms race on a scale never seen before in Southeast Asia. That scenario is in nobody's best interest. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Japan must, however, do more. Japan must take responsibility in the world, not as a commercial buccaneer, but as a mature, responsible nation. We should be encouraging the Japanese to take a leadership role commensurate with Japan's economic standing. That means far more, for example, than affording Japan a seat on the U.N. Security Council to demonstrate its position in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It means that Japan will have to start making hard choices -- choices that may mean forgoing a market opportunity in a country in return for improvement in the standard of living for a nation's people. As yet, they have shied away from putting themselves on the line on some of the toughest policy issues like human rights and proliferation. It means that Japan maintains a strong enough economy that it should begin to use its influence not just toopen markets, but to leverage its power to affect change for the better in other countries. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As Japan takes more responsibilities onto itself, I hope our trading relationship can flourish fairly. And on that note, I must tip my hat to Mickey Kantor. He has shown real gumption in pushing Japan with the threat of sanctions and retaliation in U.S. markets, all of which goes to show that not every fight needs to end in a war if the United States is willing to stand up to defend its national interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The South Koreans should be mindful in this regard, as well. A solid friendship underlies the U.S.-South Korean relationship. But if South Korea is to play a more significant role on the world stage, it, too, must become more considerate of, and receptive to, American goods and services. While the process of liberalization is underway, it should be accelerated.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economic front is not the only front on which Asia will challenge U.S. policymakers. All sorts of strategic alignments and realignments are occurring throughout Asia. The United States has to keep abreast of these changes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One of the best prospects for a flashpoint in the region is the Korean peninsula. Along with 650,000 South Korean troops, 37,000 Americans face a million-man North Korean army poised along the border of North and South Korea, a little more than a marathon distance from Seoul. The results of the much-vaunted U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework on the nuclear issue have yet to be seen, but one thing is clear: The Clinton Administration handled the North Korean regime with the same kid gloves it has heretofore used to handle all dictators from Castro to Aristide. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States has now agreed to supply hundreds of millions of dollars of oil to North Korea, enough oil to prop up the failing North Korean economy and thereby ensure that the Stalinist regime stays in power. That makes no sense. North Korea signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It violated it. It should not get paid for that violation
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Saddest, perhaps, is that the world has learned only one valuable lesson from the vile activities of the North Koreans. The world has sadly learned that the United States can be blackmailed. When the going got tough, the United States has been willing to offer up the checkbooks of the American taxpayer. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our great bargain with North Korea gives the North modern nuclear reactor technology that still allows them to produce plutonium for a nuclear weapon. The saving grace for the Clinton Administration?  The North Koreans won't be able to produce as much plutonium for nuclear weapons. And we are supposed to be relieved?  Give me a break.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indeed, the Agreed Framework is so discredited with our allies that the tripartite international organization established to implement it can't beg or borrow enough to carry out its mandate. And why won't our allies ante up?  Because they're not sanguine about the deal that was struck.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One of the central tenets of our compact with Pyongyang was that the North would begin a substantive dialogue with our allies, the South Koreans. It has not happened. The Administration has tried to convince the world that by offering the carrot of a nuclear reactor to the North, the rest of the world would benefit by having coaxed the North to talk with the South. It hasn't happened yet, and there doesn't seem to be any real movement in that direction. The real path to peace on the Korean peninsula runs directly from Seoul to Pyongyang -- not from Pyongyang to Washington. Dialogue between North and South Korea is one of the only chances the world has of seeing the Korean peninsula reunified on a peaceful, democratic, and economically solvent basis. That chance is disappearing as I speak.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And now, if I may, let me turn to one of my old hobbyhorses, Russia. I am unaccustomed to regarding Russia as an Asian power, but the time has come to recognize that fully half of Russia's territory lies in Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For nearly a thousand years, Russia has been torn by competing European and Asian influences. I believe they prefer to consider themselves Europeans.But frankly, I don't particularly care how Russia sees itself -- just as long as it does so within its own borders. Which is, historically, the biggest problem with Russia: It finds its borders so confining.... 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Every so often, our friends in Moscow decide that they have neglected their Asian side. Unfortunately, their interest has tended to manifest itself in the shape of wars of expansion. At the beginning of this century, the Russian and Japanese Empires collided in a great naval battle at Port Arthur. In World War II, the Soviet Union seized a group of islands from Japan that are today held by Russia -- an act which continues to poison relations between the two countries. Under the leadership of Stalin and Mao, the Soviet Union and China experienced decades of friction, including periodic border clashes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The challenge for Russia today is to overcome the legacy of military competition in the East and to build cooperative relations with its Asian neighbors. The question for us, however, is to what extent Russia chooses this course as an alternative to closer relations with the West.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Russia has indicated its interest in engaging Asia more closely -- witness President Yeltsin's widely touted trip to Beijing scheduled for early April. It is much repeated in Moscow that the "West" has not proven to be a gracious partner for Russia, and Russia therefore should look east. I will not dwell on the merit of Russia's criticism of the "West"; however, it is important that we all better understand what Russia seeks in engaging the East.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Closer ties between Russia and China are not automatically bad for U.S. interests. Those two nations share one of the longest land borders in the world. They certainly must, at a minimum, learn to coexist. However, if Russia seeks a closer relationship with the current regime in China as an alternative to the West, then Russia would defy its own interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some in Russia today advocate following the "Chinese model" of market economics without political freedom. This is pure folly. I see no chance that the people of Russia would allow themselves to be led by a government such as China's, which so callously disregards the rights of its own citizens. If Russia seeks partners in Asia, it should instead look to those nations which have found the path to economic success and political freedom. That's the best mix of East and West.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For real cooperation between Russia and China to succeed, it must be based on deeper interests than a momentary desire to unite against the West. I trust that responsible leaders in Russia know this to be true. I would not disregard the potential for the worst elements in the Russian and Chinese governments to try their very best to build such a relationship, but I doubt that they will succeed where Stalin and Mao failed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Frankly, I have less fear of a Sino-Russian partnership than I do of Russia's and China's meddling in Asia. Which brings me to a trouble spot that doesn't usually come up in discussions of the so-called Pacific Century -- that is, South Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Throughout the Cold War, India's own insularity allowed the United States the luxury of virtually ignoring the world's second largest nation. We no longer have that luxury for two reasons --  neither of them surprising to those of us who spend our time wrestling with the post-Cold War world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the past decade, India has become an economic power with which we all must reckon. Slowly, in its typical one step forward, ten steps backwards fashion, India is becoming an important player in the world economy. American companies are investing millions in India, and eyeing that nation's 200-plus-million middle class hungrily.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, as India becomes part of the world of fair-trading nations, India is also fighting to become a nuclear power. India exploded a nuclear device in 1974 and, until just a month or two ago, was on the verge of testing another. In addition, India has developed ballistic missiles and is moving quickly to produce them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India's leaders would have us believe that their drive for nuclear weapons and long-range missiles has to do with the odious Chinese threat to India's north, which is only partly true. Certainly, China has been no friend to India, and a good -- perhaps too good -- friend to Pakistan. But India's real problem is to its west, in Kashmir and in Pakistan. The vast majority of India's troops are concentrated on its Pakistani border and in Kashmir, and not on the Indo-Chinese border. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pakistan, long a good and a true ally of the United States, is persuaded that India is bent on Pakistan's destruction. It's remedy has been to turn to the Safeway of proliferating nations -- China. Nuclear technology, missiles, arms of every kind are to be had for the asking over in Beijing. China, uniquely positioned to moderate the policies of its neighbors in South Asia, has instead used tensions in that region to profit on the deadly proliferation market. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So how, ideally, does the United States respond?  Ideally, we look to one of the sources of the problem: Kashmir. We work with a portion of the vigor we have dedicated to Middle East peacemaking to forcefully persuade India and Pakistan to move to a settlement. Ideally, we slam China for fueling the South Asia arms race and demonstrate our own seriousness in fighting proliferation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But then there is the real world. The Clinton Administration makes excuses for China. Mind bogglingly, we are told -- again -- that China did not fully comprehend its commitments under the Nonproliferation Treaty and, therefore, probably was not in the "wrong" in transferring missile technology to Pakistan. Pakistan is threatened with sanctions for buying missiles and nuclear technology, and rightly so. But when Prime Minister Bhutto begs for help in dealing with India, the Clinton Administration is not interested.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India, happy to absorb $100-plus-million in U.S. foreign aid every year, laughs in our faces when we demand that they work with us against proliferation. And at any hint that the United States might get serious, legions of companies are brought in to describe to us the importance of continuing to do business with India. After all, the Indians may not like China, but they sure have learned a thing or two from Beijing about how to manipulate Washington, D.C.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Well, now, I have spent much of my time talking about the 800-pound gorillas of Asia. Now let's talk a bit about the tigers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are booming. Over the past five years, they have averaged 7 percent growth, a trend that promises to continue for at least the next few decades. The ASEAN story is a genuine success story. Consider that a group of nations with disparate histories, languages, and economies joined together to ensure stability in the region. They recognized early on that they could provide commensurate counterweight to the economic and strategic forces of China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula only if they were united. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Developing strong ties with each of the members of ASEAN will be another linchpin in the U.S. approach to Asia. We must work -- and work harder -- with our close friends in ASEAN to encourage them to bring pressure for reform to bear on countries like Vietnam, Laos, and Burma --  - countries where repressive governments have still not adopted the rule of law or accepted the international norms for the treatment of human rights.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For Burma and Laos, the lure of ASEAN membership is a significant enough draw to encourage these countries actually to consider liberalization. The question will be whether the current ASEAN countries make that issue a priority. Without encouragement and even pressure from the United States, they will not do so. That would be a serious mistake -- though only one more in a series of mistakes in Asia for this administration. The United States cannot afford to let this ball drop. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Somehow the Clinton Administration approach to U.S.-Asia policy reminds me of Alice in Wonderland -- if you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there. The United States today is in the position, economically and militarily, to be the dominant friendly power in the Asia-Pacific. We can't afford to squander that position in the run-up to the Pacific Century. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There's no crystal ball telling us how the world will unfold, but I am confident of Asia's central part in that world. There is a famous Chinese proverb that says something along the lines of: "If the water is murky, just wait and let it settle. Then it will all be clear to you."  The future of the region and the U.S. position there is murky now, but we cannot sit and wait for the waters to clear before we define our policies. 

<p>U.S. policy must directly address U.S. interests in Asia. There are at least five points for us to stress:</p>

<p>(1) Maintain open and peaceful shipping waters for trade; </p>

<p>(2) Maintain a strategic balance between China, Japan, the Korean peninsula, and Southeast Asia, all the while preventing a cataclysmic arms race; </p>

<p>(3) Push for more open, less regulated markets for U.S. goods and services; </p>
<p/>
(4) Show the nations in the region that we are serious about their adherence to bilateral and multilateral agreements by punishing those who transgress; and </p>
<p>
(5) Strengthen the friendships we maintain with our true allies in the region -- Taiwan and South Korea, to name just two -- rather than coddle dictators because we fear that we might lose market share.</p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
You have been patient with me, and I thank you most sincerely for the opportunity to share some views with you this evening. I am genuinely honored to be in the company of the high caliber of Asia and foreign policy specialists in this room tonight, and I hope I will have the benefit of your views later in the evening.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	With passage of the historic Telecommunications Act of 1996 earlier this year, many in Congress, the media, and the public have been led to believe that the long-awaited task of communications deregulation has been completed. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	While the new Telecommunications Act takes some important steps toward market liberalization, they are in many cases tiny steps. Furthermore, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is charged with the task of implementing the Act, already has shown itself eager to exploit the vague rhetoric and loopholes found in many sections of the Act by expanding rather than rolling back regulations. Worse still, some of the recent FCC proceedings and rule-makings undertaken supposedly to comply with this legislation are so complex, notes investment analyst Susan A. Lynner of Prudential Securities, that, "If the devil is in the details, then we must be in hell."<sup>1</sup>  In many ways, these problems can be traced to poorly worded or open-ended sections and clauses found in the original legislative language of the Telecommunications Act. <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		 But the more serious problem with the Telecommunications Act is not what it includes, but what it does not include. The statute almost completely ignores the segment of the communications marketplace that is experiencing the most innovation and entrepreneurship -- the wireless sector. The legislation focuses primarily on wireline issues (local telephony and cable in particular). Wireless industries that currently use the electromagnetic wireless spectrum<sup>2</sup> (such as cellular or broadcasting), as well as other businesses that hope to enter the wireless market, do not receive comparable attention.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Realizing this, Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD) has circulated a staff discussion draft, "The Electromagnetic Spectrum Management Policy Reform and Privatization Act," as the prelude to possible legislation. Senator Pressler is Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. The proposal is sweeping in its scope and, if implemented, would force a complete overhaul of wireless spectrum regulatory policy. Among its beneficial steps, Senator Pressler's proposal:<ul>

<li><b>Provides spectrum flexibility.</b> The proposal would end seven decades of spectrum mismanagement and industrial policy by allowing spectrum holders to use their spectrum for whatever purpose they wish. No longer would the FCC be allowed to "zone" the spectrum in discrete parcels and place restrictions on its use.
<p>
<li><b>Expands and makes permanent the auction and allocation process.</b> The FCC's extremely successful experiment with spectrum auctions would be expanded and made permanent for new uses of spectrum.
<p>
<li><b>Creates a second-best broadcaster spectrum auction solution.</b> Although the Pressler proposal backs away from the contentious issue of auctioning off licenses already set to be given away to the broadcast television industry, it does create a favorable alternative. Broadcasters would be forced to pay a deposit for receipt of new digital licenses, and this deposit would be fully refundable when they turn in their old analog license after a 15-year transition period. Alternatively, if broadcasters did not wish to pay the deposit, they could opt to keep their current analog license forever and forgo the opportunity to obtain a new digital license. If they chose this second option, the leftover spectrum would be auctioned to other users.
<p>
<li><b>Prohibits FCC spectrum standard-setting or construction mandates.</b> The Pressler plan wisely mandates that the FCC could not engage in technical standard-setting because the staggering pace of technological change in this industry will likely make any standard irrelevant in the near future. Furthermore, the bill would prohibit the FCC from micromanaging construction specifications and timetables of new spectrum networks.
<p>
<li><b>Demands release of more publicly held spectrum and more efficient public use of spectrum:</b> In an important step, the Pressler plan demands that federal agencies reallocate large portions of inefficiently used government spectrum to private use. Furthermore, the spectrum that remains in government hands would have to be used more efficiently.
<p>
<li><b>Transfers all spectrum responsibilities from the NTIA to the FCC and block grants public safety spectrum to the states.</b> The proposal also would eliminate needless spectrum management duplication by transferring all spectrum authority currently held by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to the FCC. In addition, the bill would block grant public safety spectrum back to the states so they can control locally all spectrum needed for police, fire, and other safety uses.
<p>
<li><b>Requires a spectrum report.</b> Finally, the plan would mandate a review of the effects of the bill two years after implementation and require the FCC to suggest further deregulatory initiatives that can be undertaken.</ul>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Pressler plan, if enacted into law, would represent the most important privatization effort undertaken by the federal government in recent years. This would spur job and export creation in this highly innovative American industry. Failure to implement these reforms, on the other hand, would mean that Congress's efforts to revolutionize the communications industry would remain limited and incomplete. 
<p>

<b>WHY REFORM IS NEEDED</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Senator Pressler's spectrum reform and privatization plan is vital for several reasons. The current system of spectrum management is roundly criticized because:<ul>
<li><b>It is resistant to change and innovation.</b> Currently, federal spectrum regulators are allowed to decide who may use spectrum, where they may use it, how long they may use it, and most important, to what use they may put their spectrum. This is often referred to as "spectrum zoning," to borrow a real estate land management metaphor. Not surprisingly, this zoning leads to massive misallocations and misuses of spectrum. Once a certain technology is locked into place, it can take years before another use of that spectrum is allowed; thus, both innovation and entrepreneurial activity are discouraged by this technological industrial policy. 
<p>
<li><b>It imposes large costs of delay.</b> Not surprisingly, this resistance to change and innovation results in enormous costs. These costs can be measured either in terms of the number of new products offered to consumers or in terms of the overall loss of economic activity to the economy. The costs are high. For example, even though spectrum was reallocated in 1970 to make room for cellular services, the first experimental license was not granted by the FCC until 1977, and other commercial licenses were not granted until the early 1980s. Economists Jeffrey H. Rohlfs, Charles L. Jackson, and Tracey E. Kelly have argued that "had the FCC proceeded directly to licensing from its 1970 allocation decision, cellular licenses could have been granted as early as 1972 and systems could have become operational in 1973, a decade earlier than they were in reality."<sup>3</sup>  As a result, they estimate, this regulatory delay cost the U.S. economy $86 billion, or 2 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1983, when cellular licensing finally began.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
<li><b>It is open to special interest influence and discourages competition.</b> With such a tight hold on the spectrum reins, regulators can steer the industry in almost any direction they desire. Worse yet, because communications regulation often has resembled a "good old boy" network -- with favored industry groups working hand-in-hand with regulators to craft policy -- competition has been discouraged. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example, for many years the broadcast industry worked with the FCC to restrict the rise of cable television, since it posed an obvious threat to the unchallenged hegemony of the broadcast industry. As telecommunications scholars Michael K. Kellogg, John Thorne, and Peter W. Huber note, "For many years the FCC's principal objective was to suppress the cable industry by preventing direct competition between cable and over-the-air broadcasting. It did so quite successfully.... "<sup>5</sup> This regulatory setback delayed the onset of video competition for over a decade.<sup>6</sup>  Despite no clear explanation of how this served the public, the FCC continued to implement these anti-competitive policies, even though it had received no explicit grant of congressional authority to do so.<sup>7</sup><p><li><b>There is a lack of respect for First Amendment rights.</b> Finally, the current system of spectrum management provides regulators with the ability to influence directly the content and composition of specific types of programming, and to threaten firms with discontinuation of the right to operate if they fail to comply with regulatory edicts. For example, the FCC currently uses the Children's Television Act of 1990 as a tool for blatant regulatory extortion. The FCC has gone beyond the admittedly vague statutory language of the Act to demand specific quantitative minimum numbers of hours of children's programming in exchange for allowing business other freedoms.<sup>8</sup>  For example, after CBS and Westinghouse recently announced their intention to merge, FCC regulators (who have the power to block such alliances) forced the companies to promise that certain quantitative programming requirements would be honored as a condition of merger approval. Several other firms have faced similar threats from the FCC as a condition of normal business operation. 	<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Even though such regulatory blackmail would represent a clear First Amendment violation if applied in the print realm (fo
r example to newspapers or magazines), it is considered normal operating procedure in the realm of electronic communication (radio or television broadcasters).
</ul><p>


<b>WHAT THE PRESSLER PLAN WOULD DO</b>

	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Fortunately, the Pressler plan would correct most of these flaws within the current system. Specifically, the proposal:<ul>

<li><b>Provides spectrum flexibility.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would end seven decades of misguided and inefficient spectrum management, allowing spectrum users to use their licenses to provide any service in any way they desire as long as it does not interfere with another spectrum user or violate any U.S. treaty obligations with other nations regarding international spectrum use. It also would allow spectrum users to transfer their flexible spectrum freely to others on the open market. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 This would mean the death of federal spectrum industrial policies because it would prohibit any further "zoning" of spectrum. This could encourage a "spectrum renaissance," as many entrepreneurial ideas that could not be acted upon in the past due to spectrum operating restrictions could now be implemented. Countless innovations and new job opportunities would spring from a wireless marketplace freed from its regulatory shackles.
<p>
<li><b>Expands and makes permanent the auction and allocation process.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler plan would expand and make permanent the extraordinarily successful system of spectrum auctioning that Congress originally authorized in 1993. Tens of billions of dollars have been generated for the U.S. Treasury and an enormous amount of innovation already has taken place, thanks to the auctioning process. In fact, an entirely new industry, the personal communications service sector (PCS), a more advanced system of wireless cellular communication, has been created as a result of the auction process. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 Unfortunately, Congress limited the applicability and time of auctions in 1993. The Pressler proposal would mandate that only auctions be used in the future and any potential "mutually exclusive use" of the spectrum (when two or more parties vie for the same spectrum allocation) must be thrown open to competitive bidding at an auction. There would be four notable exemptions, however, to this general rule. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 <b>First</b>, any spectrum request that is "non-mutually exclusive" (only one party requests the spectrum), obviously would not be open to an auction. This spectrum would simply be given to the party requesting it. The FCC could demand, however, that these users pay user fees to the government to ensure that the spectrum is not hoarded or used inefficiently.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		<b>Second</b>, public safety users of spectrum would be exempted. These spectrum uses would include such things as police and fire stations that need to communicate over the radio spectrum, as well as Department of Defense military applications. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 <b>Third</b>, spectrum required for global satellite orbital assignments would not be auctioned since this would create international difficulties with other countries that possess different spectrum assignment mechanisms. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 <b>Fourth</b>, while it is reasonable to exempt the previous three uses and users from spectrum auctions, the following exemption reflects the raw political power of an industry rather than good policy. 
<p>

<li><b>Creates a second-best broadcaster spectrum auction solution.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would exempt from auction the licenses set to be given away to broadcasters for the provision of digital television. This is unfortunate, because $10 billion to $70 billion worth of spectrum would be lost if such a giveaway to the broadcast industry were allowed to go forward. Worse yet, it would single out one segment of the industry for special treatment in a time when everyone else in the industry is being forced to spend billions bidding at competitive auctions to obtain the additional spectrum they need or desire to conduct business.<sup>9</sup>  Political pressure from the broadcast lobby has led many in Congress to abandon any hope of auctioning this spectrum.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Yet the Pressler plan would create a second-best solution, referred to as the "deposit, return and overlay approach."  Basically, every television broadcast licensee in America would be able to choose between one of the following two plans: 
<p>
	 <b>Option #1:</b> A broadcaster could obtain an additional license directly from the government instead of through a competitive auction, but pay periodic fees or deposits into an escrow account. The fees collected from broadcasters would be based on the value of similar licenses sold in "overlay" auctions. Overlay refers to the technological capability to use certain portions of the spectrum simultaneously for multiple uses. Spectrum adjoining that which would be given to broadcasters therefore could be auctioned off, and its auction price would then be used to determine the amount of the fee or deposit broadcasters would be forced to pay for exclusive use of the additional spectrum.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the 15-year transition period when broadcasters each would possess two licenses (one analog, one digital), accrued interest on the spectrum deposit account would be placed in the U.S. Treasury to pay for tax cuts or deficit reduction. After the 15-year transition period ended, broadcasters could relinquish their older analog license and receive their deposit back from the government (less the accrued interest that went into the Treasury). For every year the broadcasters held their old license in excess of the 15-year cutoff date, they would lose 20 percent of their overall deposit; after five years, in other words, they would lose the full value of their deposit if they did not return the old license.

<p><b>Option #2:</b> Broadcasters could bypass the opportunity to obtain a second license directly from the government and instead opt to keep their older analog license perpetually. No spectrum fees or deposits would be owed by those who chose this option. The spectrum relinquished in this manner would then be auctioned by the FCC. Overall auctions would still take place, however. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 This "deposit, return and overlay" approach is a good second-best alternative to straightforward auctions because it would provide a method of compensation for the use of spectrum and, would not allow broadcasters to keep two licenses without incurring serious costs.
<p>
<li><b>Prohibits FCC spectrum standard-setting or construction mandates.</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would explicitly prohibit the FCC from imposing a digital television standard on the American marketplace. It simultaneously would avoid any compatibility or construction requirements that could lead to the adoption of yet another misguided industrial policy. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 Unfortunately, the FCC in May did adopt a standard for digital television, largely to appease electronics manufacturers that wanted to lock in the technological system they favor. Although the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) Digital Standard that was adopted allows television broadcasters flexible use of their spectrum, many other potential spectrum users, especially innovative computer companies such as Microsoft Corporation and Apple Computer, objected to the standard for various technological reasons. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 Surprisingly, the ATSC standard was adopted despite the warnings of FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, who questioned whether the agency was in the best position to set such a standard during a period of rapid innovation. In a statement, Hundt asked, "Why is it in the public interest to adopt rules freezing the current state of technology?  Given the rapid pace of technological change, isn't it inevitable that there will be innovations that even the flexible ATSC Standard cannot accommodate?"<sup>10</sup>  Even more important, "Shouldn't we be concerned that erecting a regulatory barrier to the use of new technologies may discourage the research and development necessary for innovation?"  Hundt went on to ask, "How is it consistent with the deregulatory spirit of the new Telecommunications Act to codify (directly or indirectly) the 200-plus pages of technical details that constitute the ATSC Standard?"<sup>11</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	There are no easy or good answers to Chairman Hundt's questions because there is no legitimate reason for the FCC to be in the business of technological standard-setting in the first place. The FCC has a long and checkered history of experience with television standards. As a Progress and Freedom Foundation telecommunications working group report notes, "The modern television was exhibited by RCA in 1939, but the FCC took years to adopt initial standards. The FCC then froze all applications for TV licenses until 1952. In the year after the freeze was ended, the number of stations tripled. However, a 1952 FCC decision deliberately limited the number of viable stations per market, and impeded the creation of additional TV networks, at enormous costs to the American viewing public."<sup>12</sup>  With this history and a healthy respect for the pace of technological change in mind, the Pressler plan would prohibit standard-setting at the FCC.
<p>
<li><b>Demands release of more publicly held spectrum and more efficient public use of spectrum.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would mandate that, beginning next year, 25 percent of the spectrum the federal government currently owns exclusively or shares with the private sector below a certain frequency (5 GHz) shall be re-allocated for private sector auctions. Beyond this 25 percent of publicly held spectrum found under 5 GHz, the Pressler plan would require that the President appoint a seven-member "Advisory Committee on Withdrawal" to determine the amount of additional public spectrum that could be transferred to the private sector over a ten-year period.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	More important, the Pressler plan would initiate a financial incentive program to encourage government spectrum users to surrender portions of their spectrum voluntarily for private auctions. For example, if the Department of Transportation or Department of Defense realized they were stockpiling large portions of spectrum that were not being utilized, under the Pressler proposal they could turn in the spectrum for private auction and then receive a cut of the auction proceeds (which could be used for employee bonuses). This would be an important incentive for federal agencies that are hoarding spectrum inefficiently to transfer that spectrum to more efficient and profitable uses and users.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal also would require that, to the maximum extent possible, federal spectrum users rely on the private sector to supply them with radio communications equipment. Competitive bidding also would be required for all new federal government procurement of radio communications systems. Finally, the proposal would mandate that federal agencies work together with private sector firms to utilize more advanced and efficient digital services that would then open up more spectrum for use. Once a government agency and a private sector firm had installed the new digital technologies and created new spectrum capacity, the agency and the firm could divide the spectrum for other uses. The President would have the ability, however, to veto any FCC action related to public spectrum use that was deemed harmful to national security or public safety.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler plan also would place public spectrum users on equal footing with private users in terms of spectrum flexibility. Government spectrum users would be able to transfer their spectrum to any other public or private entity and receive compensation. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		 In addition, the plan would likely raise significant revenues for deficit reduction or taxpayer relief. 	 
<p>
<li><b>Transfers all spectrum responsibilities from the NTIA to the FCC and block grants public safety spectrum to the states.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler plan would end needless duplication of spectrum management responsibilities by consolidating all authority within the FCC. Currently, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) manages the publicly held spectrum, while the FCC manages all private spectrum. Upon implementation of the plan, all NTIA functions would be transferred to the FCC, and the NTIA, now part of the Department of Commerce, could be closed down.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal also would "block grant" authority over public safety spectrum back to the states. In essence, those portions of the spectrum required by state and local public safety users (police and fire stations) would be managed by the states. Any interference issues that arose would be adjudicated by the FCC. 
<p>
<li><b>Requires a spectrum report to monitor progress.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would require that the FCC prepare a spectrum report summarizing the progress and results of this deregulatory effort. This would include both a cost-benefit analysis of the measure and additional legislative recommendations from the FCC to further the process of spectrum reform. </ul>
<p>


<b>HOW THE PRESSLER PLAN COULD BE IMPROVED</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Even though the Pressler discussion draft marks a significant and beneficial step in the right direction, it could be improved. Additional reforms that should be undertaken and policy clarifications that are needed include:<ul>

<li><b>Hold outright, unambiguous auctions for all spectrum uses and users.</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Although the Pressler proposal would create a sensible second-best solution to the broadcast spectrum dilemma, it is still preferable to apply auctions equally to all spectrum uses and users. It simply makes no sense to carve out special exemptions for certain industries while Congress is attempting to craft more pro-competitive, anti-monopolistic telecommunications policies. Many policymakers argue that the special "social compact" the public has with the broadcast industry justifies giving broadcasters special non-auction status, with government furnishing private broadcasters with free licenses in exchange for universal, high-quality informational and entertainment service.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		But by almost any measure, broadcasters have not lived up to their end of the bargain. Broadcasters, in fact have served the public poorly, primarily because they have not faced stiff competition for viewer allegiance until recent years. Hence, they have felt little pressure to improve the quality of their programming.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Congress should end this failed social compact with broadcasters and demand that they enter the competitive age of communications on the same basis as all others in the industry. The Pressler plan could be improved markedly by making sure that such uncompetitive favoritism is ended once and for all.
<p>
<li><b>De-license the entire spectrum.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	While providing complete flexibility in use is an important and long-needed step toward a free market in spectrum, the Pressler plan fails to take the final step needed to ensure that spectrum socialism is ended forever. Congress needs to eliminate all spectrum licensing requirements and provide current license holders full property rights to their spectrum allocation. This would ensure that all bureaucratic spectrum meddling ends and that a truly free market reigns in the wireless realm, as it does in real estate markets where private property rights have worked so well for centuries. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 This does not mean anarchy would be or should be allowed to exist in wireless spectrum markets. Government would still have an important role in enforcing property rights in spectrum. For example, interference and trespass issues would still need to be adjudicated and resolved by independent third parties. This does not mean, however, that only the FCC is suited to carry out this task. In fact, enforcing property rights in spectrum should be easier than enforcing them in land since fewer "externality" concerns exist. For example, while river and air pollution present special problems in the enforcement of land property rights, no comparable externalities exist in the wireless spectrum. Private spectrum coordination organizations (which already exist), the courts, or a federal administrative body much smaller than the FCC could carry out any straightforward dispute resolution concerns that remain.
<p>
<li><b>End "public interest standard" regulation and guarantee equal First Amendment protections for all media, whether print or electronic.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	At the heart of everything that is wrong with modern communications law lies the "public interest standard."  This standard, which has governed communications policy at the FCC for almost seven decades, has never been defined. In effect, therefore, is a non-standard; it has no fixed meaning. Its vagueness has been used by federal regulators to destroy competition, to threaten the livelihood of existing businesses, and, most important, evade First Amendment restrictions -- all in the name of protecting the public.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal, like the Telecommunications Act which preceded it, would do nothing to define this open-ended regulatory standard or minimize its uncompetitive effect on the wireless marketplace. Bureaucrats would continue to be able to diminish competitive opportunities and run roughshod over the First Amendment rights of spectrum users. This makes increasingly less sense as wireless electronic technologies (which are accorded only secondary First Amendment protections) subsume the more traditional print media (which are accorded strict First Amendment rights). If Congress does not define this standard clearly, the FCC conceivably could decide to regulate the content of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal merely because these and other newspapers and magazines are delivered over an electronic medium the agency is able to regulate under the public interest standard. Congress would find it difficult to explain to the public (not to mention the editors of these private and traditionally unregulated newspapers) just why regulation is needed merely because the public receives these dailies over computer screens instead of on paper.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	In short, the public interest standard may serve the interests of regulators and the special interests that benefit from its uncompetitive edicts, but it does not serve the consuming public. It should be clear that policymakers can choose regulation under the public interest standard or they can choose free competition -- but they cannot choose both. Cutting the spectrum loose from its 70-year-old regulatory shackles is the best way to serve the public interest.
<p>
<li><b>End protectionist policies that restrict beneficial foreign investment in spectrum technologies and companies, and combine this with privatization of international satellite organizations.</b> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Under Section 310(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, foreign companies may not own a radio communications license and may not own more than 20 percent of the shares of a company that holds a radio communications license. This protectionist restriction has outlived its usefulness. While national security concerns may have served as a valid justification for prohibiting foreign investment in the past, this policy no longer makes sense. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 Restricting foreign investment in spectrum technologies and firms cuts off the flow of beneficial capital and expertise. Just as free trade in other sectors has benefited the American economy and improved the nation's competitiveness, openness to free trade in communications goods and services will best serve the interests of American firms and consumers.<sup>13</sup> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		 While an effort was made during committee debate over the Telecommunications Act to include language eliminating or at least curtailing the effect of Section 310(b), such language was not included in the final conference bill. The Pressler proposal could correct this mistake by repealing Section 310(b) and all other telecommunications spectrum protectionism once and for all.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Also, to promote international trade in telecommunications, the Pressler plan could take steps to begin breaking down the global monopolies held by international satellite organizations such as Inmarsat and Intelsat. These organizations are international consortia of various signatory countries that have long held a strong grip over access to international satellite service. Comsat is the U.S. representative to Inmarsat (which provides mobile and maritime satellite services) and Intelsat (which provides global television and telephone services). Now that viable private satellite carriers exist that can provide international communications services more efficiently, these organizations should be privatized and all special privileges they receive should be revoked to encourage a more competitive marketplace.
<p></ul>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	While the Pressler spectrum privatization proposal is not perfect, it represents the boldest and most principled deregulatory initiative in the field of communications to date. In comparison to the initial drafts of the Telecommunications Act, which pre-emptively compromised on key policy issues, Senator Pressler's initial spectrum effort represents near flawless deregulatory legislation. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 If Congress fails to pursue this unique spectrum liberalization effort, it will be forgoing the most important privatization opportunity in years -- perhaps in this century. Countless new innovations would flow from the creation of a free market in spectrum. This innovation and entrepreneurship would create untold numbers of new job and export opportunities. In short, the Pressler spectrum privatization plan would revolutionize the communications industry and provide a much-needed boost to the American economy.

Hazlett notes that when cable television (or "CATV" as it was known then) was developing between 1959 and 1972, "Cable television was then officially judged a menace to society, and the [FCC] had launched a regulatory jihad against it. Like all holy wars, this offensive was undertaken in the 'public interest'."  Hazlett dramatically illustrates the FCC's protectionist policies in action by quoting from a 1966 Commission report on cable: "We must thoroughly examine the question of CATV entry into the major markets, and authorize such entry only upon a hearing record giving reasonable assurance that the consequences of such entry will not thwart the achievement of Congressional goals. We cannot sit back and let CATV move signals about as it wishes.... " Quoted in, <i>ibid</i>., p. 42.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Since the early 1930s, no sector of the American economy has been more heavily regulated than the financial services industry, and particularly commercial banks. Addressing an industry conference, Jerry L. Jordan, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, summed up the extent of banking regulations by noting that 
<blockquote>

For more than 60 years, the Glass-Steagall Act has defined what a banking organization has been allowed to do; the Douglas and other bank holding company acts have defined the corporate form required to do it; the national or state banking authorities, deposit insurance agencies, and Federal Reserve have defined how to do it; and their supervisors and examiners have made sure it was done that way. It's a tribute to the perennial optimism of human beings that a conference on the future of banking might talk about anything other than <I>regulation</I>.<sup>1</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Indeed, it is difficult to speak of banking or any other financial service without also mentioning the overwhelming amount of federal regulation that affects the industry. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the heart of this regulatory web is the Banking Act of 1933, commonly known as the Glass-Steagall Act. Glass-Steagall established barriers between commercial banks and their investment counterparts. It also established barriers between banks and other commercial businesses so that today, a bank that offers loans and checking accounts cannot also directly underwrite securities for its business customers or offer life insurance policies to its consumers. This theory of "separation banking" continued to drive federal regulation for 60 years. Each time the market established a legal connection between banking and another financial or commercial sector, the government stepped in with new regulations preventing such a relationship. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; As a result of legal restrictions, banks have seen their share of the financial services sector slip away to less-regulated competitors. In fact, between 1952 and 1994, banks, thrifts, and credit unions saw their share of the financial sector fall from 67.4 percent to 35.5 percent,<sup>2</sup> largely because banks are prohibited from taking advantage of innovative investment opportunities and offering modern financial options to their customers. In essence, banks are asked to compete in the technologically advanced 1990s using only 1930s investment techniques. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Consumers suffer substantial harm from the forced separation of financial services. Every producer and consumer in the United States is connected in some way to the financial services industry, be it through a simple $100 checking account or by means of a complex, multibillion-dollar corporate merger. Nearly every economic transaction -- millions of them each day -- involves the exchange of money or the promise of a future exchange of money, so every producer and consumer in the country feels the weight of financial service regulations daily. And every day, producers and consumers pay an unnecessary premium for this burdensome system of regulation.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is impossible to repair a system as broken as the federal financial regulatory system.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress and the President should allow financial services to be provided within a free market by eliminating the many regulations that currently interfere with efficient transactions and savings. The first step in this process is elimination of the artificial barriers that have been created between commercial and investment banking and all other commercial and financial activities.<sup>3</sup>  Specifically, Congress and the President should:<ul><p><li>

Repeal the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which prohibits umbrella bank holding companies from owning diverse financial businesses, and the 1970 amendments that expand these restrictions to commercial businesses;

<p><li>Repeal the Banking Act of 1933 (the Glass-Steagall Act), which prohibits financial service companies from offering a full range of financial and commercial services;

<p><li>Eliminate all federal regulatory barriers to integrated financial service provision; and

<p><li>Allow commercial companies to offer a full range of financial services, including individual savings and checking accounts, small business loans, consumer lines of credit, and diversified investment services.</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Enacting these recommendations is the first step in ending more than 60 years of harmful financial regulation and allowing the American financial system to take advantage of modern technology. As a guide to policymakers, this <I>Talking Points</I> reviews the history of federal laws that have prohibited integrated financial services, offers recommendations based on a conclusion that these laws are antiquated, discusses the benefits of financial services reform, and reviews current reform efforts.
<p>
<b>A BRIEF HISTORY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The general framework of modern financial service regulation was set by the Banking Act of 1933 (the Glass-Steagall Act), passed by Congress in reaction to the more than 10,000 bank failures or forced mergers between 1929 and 1933. In general, Glass-Steagall prohibits banks from offering a full range of banking services. According to Jonathan Macey and Geoffrey Miller, authors of <I>Banking Law and Regulation:</I> "Responding to political charges that the Depression had been caused by bank speculation in securities, the Glass-Steagall Act separated commercial banking from investment banking. Securities firms were not to accept deposits or affiliate with deposit-taking institutions; and commercial bank members of the Federal Reserve System were barred from participating, either directly or indirectly, in many aspects of the securities business."<sup>4</sup>  This separation evolved from a fear by politicians that commercial banks were commonly engaged in risky investments using the deposits of individuals and small businesses. From their perspective, banks were gambling with the life savings of an unsuspecting public.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Shortly before final passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, Senator Carter Glass expressed the depth of this fear: "The main purpose of the bill as passed by the Senate last spring, as Senators will recall, was to prevent, under penalty, the use of Federal Reserve banking facilities for stock-gambling purposes. I use that term in its harshest sense, realizing that it touches the sensibilities of a great many people who persist in calling it 'stock-investment purposes.'"<sup>5</sup>  These comments by one of the Act's principal sponsors epitomize the heated rhetoric that surrounded banking regulation in the early years of the Depression. It is ironic that these words are still used by legislators to justify expansion of strict banking regulations.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The driving fear behind passage of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933 has continued to guide banking regulation ever since. Every time the banking industry found a legal way to link commercial banking with investment services or other commercial activities, federal regulators blocked the path. For example, after the passage of Glass-Steagall, many bankers created bank holding companies or umbrella organizations that owned a share of several different companies. A holding company might have owned a commercial bank, an investment bank, and an insurance company. Because these holdings were separate entities, such an arrangement was legal. And although such an arrangement was not very efficient, it did offer bank holding companies many of the advantages of integrated banking.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, however, was passed to prevent these bank holding companies from simultaneously owning such diverse financial entities. Specifically, the Act "was intended to make bank holding companies subject to federal regulation and, more specifically, to get all of them out of commerce."<sup>6</sup>  Moreover, the same fears about bigness and the safety of individual savings that led to passage of Glass-Steagall also led to passage of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The principal sponsor of the 1956 Act, Senator Willis Robertson of Virginia, did not hesitate to invoke the shade of his fellow Virginian and predecessor, Carter Glass, recalling that "as early as 1938 Glass realized that the restrictions provided were not adequate to protect independent bankers from possible monopolistic situations and he sought to have them strengthened.... My own efforts to pick up and carry on the attempts of my predecessor to regulate bank holding companies more effectively began in 1949."<sup>7</sup>  As John Kareken notes, "Revealing its fear of bigness, a fear linking it to Congresses past and future, the Eighty-fifth Congress responded with the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956."<sup>8</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This fear of bigness and belief that integrated banks were too risky with individual deposits were evident throughout the 1960s and 1970s as federal courts and regulators continued to separate commercial and investment banking. In a 1981 decision, the Supreme Court declared: "Congress was persuaded that speculative activities, partially attributable to the connection between commercial banking and investment banking, had contributed to the rash of bank failures [leading up to the Great Depression]."<sup>9</sup>  As recently as March 1995, these fears continued to influence congressional action (or in this case, inaction). Testifying before the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, James L. Bothwell, Director of Financial Institutions and Markets Issues for the General Accounting Office, asked: "How would the public respond if a major company that owned a bank got into trouble?  How would regulators be able to maintain adequate supervision of the company as a whole?"<sup>10</sup>  Because lawmakers evidently found this possibility disconcerting, federal law has continued to prevent banks and bank holding companies from engaging in any other commercial or financial activity, in hopes of preventing bank failures and the loss of depositor money.
<p>
<b>THE CASE FOR REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Two main fears have guided the mandatory separation of commercial banking and investment banking: risk of loss and conflict of interest. These fears have guided federal policy at least since the Depression. However, studies undertaken over the past 35 years have demonstrated that these fears are groundless. This research has demonstrated that integrated banking, a free market in which financial companies are free to engage in any activity they wish, leads to banks that are both safer and less prone to failure. Moreover, most banks carefully avoid a possible conflict of interest because to do so is in the best interest of the company and its investors. The natural conclusion is that laws and regulations which prohibit integrated banking should be eliminated and that commercial banks, bank holding companies, insurance providers, investment banks, and other commercial firms should be allowed to enter a full range of financial and commercial activities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Risk of Loss.</b> Perhaps the greatest fear lawmakers have expressed concerning the relationship between commercial banking and investment or other financial activities is that the inherent risk of such endeavors places deposited money in jeopardy. A loss could destroy the financial security of people who have deposited their life savings in the bank.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nor has the bank holding company structure been viewed as any safer with respect to investment money. It is feared, for example, that a bank might simply transfer capital to an affiliated investment bank or insurance company. Considered equally dangerous, "a bank might purchase securities from its affiliate at greater-than-market prices or sell securities and make loans to facilitate securities purchases from the affiliate at less-than-market prices."<sup>11</sup>  In any case, the concern is that bankers would worry first about their own financial interest and only then about the security of bank depositors' money.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If these risks indeed were a threat, or if bankers really were concerned only about their own financial security, banks that engaged in stock market investment before passage of Glass-Steagall would have failed at a greater rate than those which did not involve themselves in such activities. However, this was not the case. In fact, studies have shown that banks involved in securities activities were less likely to fail than those not involved in investing. Eugene White investigated and found that "while 26.3 percent of all national banks failed in this period [from 1930-1933], only 6.5 percent of the 62 banks which had [investment] affiliates in 1929 and 7.6 percent of the 145 banks which conducted large operations through their bond departments closed their doors (see Chart 2)."<sup>12</sup>  On average, banks that engaged in investment activities failed less frequently than those that did not.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The reason for the relative stability among integrated banks, as White notes, was their ability to diversify financial activities during a period of slow commercial banking. "This diversification allowed banks to gain new business as their more traditional activities stagnated and to take advantage of significant complementarities in the production of financial services."<sup>13</sup>  Also, integrated banks, primarily from necessity, tended to have larger asset bases which allowed them greater economies of scale during difficult economic times. Ironically, one of the regulators' greatest fears -- bigness -- was actually an asset to banks during the early years of the Depression.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Conflict of Interest.</b> Another important concern of bank regulators is that integrated banks would represent a clear conflict of interest that could lead bank owners and managers to put their own financial interest before that of depositors. For example, many fear that a bank underwriting equity in a company faces a perverse incentive to influence its depositors to invest in that company, even if such an investment is unsound. Banks would have an easy time persuading investors, often considered na<ve, to make risky investments. Senator Robert Bulkley summed up this belief in 1932: "The banker ought to be regarded as the financial confidant and mentor of his depositors. Obviously, the banker who has nothing to sell to his depositors is much better qualified to advise disinterestedly and to regard diligently the safety of depositors than the banker who uses the list of depositors in his savings department to distribute circulars concerning the advantages of this, that or the other investment."<sup>14</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Securities issued by commercial banks or affiliates would have underperformed when compared to securities issued by investment banks if the fear expressed by Senator Bulkley and others were well-grounded. However, evidence from the period before passage of Glass-Steagall indicates otherwise. Randall Krozner and Raghurm Rajan, professors at the University of Chicago, have found that between 1924 and 1940, "investment bank underwritten issues experienced roughly 40 percent more defaults than [did] affiliate underwritten issues."<sup>15</sup>  Additionally, they found that commercial banks and their affiliates tended to underwrite "higher-quality issues" of larger companies that were inherently safer.<sup>16</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Integrated banks tended to underwrite safer securities because the market corrected for the exact fear that legislators wished to regulate away: a risk of individual savings. Most depositors at integrated banks looked very closely at the investment portfolio of their bank to ensure a desirable level of security. Contrary to Senator Bulkley's fears, depositors made informed, sound investment decisions. Investors who were concerned not with safety, but with the potential for a greater return generally went to investment banks. Krozner and Rajan conclude:<blockquote>

Indeed, our results suggest that the public markets and rating agencies were aware of the potential for conflicts (or weak reputations) of the affiliates. The affiliates appear to have responded to the market's concerns by  underwriting primarily more senior securities and securities of older, larger, and better-known firms than did the investment banks.<sup>17</sup></blockquote>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, the market during the 1920s -- before passage of the Glass-Steagall Act -- was acting efficiently, with integrated commercial banks serving small investors concerned with safety and investment banks serving larger investors seeking a substantial but openly risky return.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All of this evidence leads to a conclusion far different from the one historically driving federal banking regulation: Integrated banks tend to be safer and less averse to conflicts of interest than a combined system of purely investment banks and purely commercial banks.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Advancing Technology</b>. The historic evidence by itself is enough to warrant a change in federal financial regulations. However, there is an additional impetus to action. Modern technology has allowed expansion of the financial services sector to the point where banks as traditionally defined are rapidly becoming obsolete. Yet institutions unfortunate enough to be classified as banks are unable to capitalize on new financial opportunities because federal regulations are still guided by laws and principles derived in the 1930s. Not only are banks hurt, but consumers are unable to take advantage of more profitable opportunities made possible by technology.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider the following:<ul>
<p><li>An average money market mutual fund earns a 4.76 percent annual rate of return,<sup>18</sup> and many offer free checking services. The average commercial bank checking account earns less than 4.0 percent interest annually, and consumers often must pay a service charge for each check or transfer. Although mutual funds are growing in popularity, many consumers do not take advantage of these financial instruments because, with rare exceptions, commercial banks are prohibited from offering them. In many cases, these consumers simply are unaware of the mutual fund option.

<p><li>Many small businesses cannot expand (or even start) because equity capital is difficult and expensive to secure. Such companies are limited in their expansion potential because they cannot incur additional debt. Moreover, these difficulties place small businesses at a disadvantage in comparison to larger corporations that enjoy ready access to investment services and are more able to afford the overhead costs of obtaining equity. Integrated financial service provision would allow local banks and providers to underwrite small local businesses and finance entrepreneurs.

<p><li>Many commercial companies have created financial service departments or affiliates. Banks, on the other hand, are prohibited from entering other commercial sectors. Therefore, they cannot take full advantage of the technology that has made it possible for companies such as General Electric, Ford, and Sears to offer various financially related services such as commercial loans, credit cards, and personal insurance.

<p><li>Technology renders many of the services to which commercial banks are limited obsolete. Today, even small investors can take advantage of large potential earnings by pooling their funds. Additionally, computers and the Internet make financial services more accessible -- but not nearly as accessible as they might be in a world without federal regulations against integrated banking. Commercial banks have the infrastructure to provide an efficient retail market. There are banks in every town in America, often on every corner in larger cities. And while the percentage of the population owning a personal computer with access to the Internet is increasing, nearly 100 percent of the population currently has easy access to a bank. If these banks were allowed to offer a full range of financial services, millions of consumers could take advantage of increased earnings. The economy as a whole also would benefit from a more efficient allocation of financial resources.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The rate at which technology is capable of changing also makes deregulation necessary. As mentioned above, for each federal regulation that aims to prevent integrated banking, the private sector devises a legal bypass. This process is like a perpetual motion machine: As the pace of technological advance quickens, federal regulations become obsolete all the more rapidly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider just two facts:
<ol><p><li>The pace of technological change over the past ten years has tended to follow Moore's Law. Named for Intel founder Gordon Moore, this law dictates that the power of advanced technology will double roughly every 18 months. In other words, the life cycle of most modern technology is less than two years.

<p><li>The average regulation takes more than two years to conceive, develop, and implement. And this does not include the time needed to legislate changes in major regulations and the time consumed by court proceedings to interpret those regulations.
</ol>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taken together, these facts lead to one overriding question: How can government possibly keep pace with such rapidly changing technology?

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Perhaps the best example of the change technology will bring to the financial services sector is the creation of digital money, often referred to as "e-cash."  E-cash, in its purest form, represents an on-line account that can be used in a manner similar to a debit card. Often called stored-value cards, e-cash accounts are being developed by many non-bank entities. Should non-bank providers be subject to the same reserve requirements and regulations as banks, and will e-cash accounts be covered under federal deposit insurance?<sup>19</sup>  These questions will have to be answered as electronic commerce becomes increasingly popular. But the first question that needs to be addressed is: Will a government-run regulatory structure that takes years to promulgate even a simple rule be able to respond to a technology that has the potential to emerge and change within months?  The answer is that it will not.
<p>
<b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b>
 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The ultimate goal of financial modernization must be to eliminate all barriers that exist between commercial banking, investment banking, and all other commercial and financial activities. It is impossible to repair a system as broken as the current federal financial regulatory system. The only sensible course is to sweep away 60 years of government intervention in financial services and begin anew with a free and open financial market. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Specifically, Congress and the President should:<ol>

<p><li><b>Repeal the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which prohibits umbrella holding companies from owning diverse financial businesses, and the 1970 amendments that expand these restrictions to commercial businesses.</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first logical step in financial modernization is to allow diverse firms to affiliate under a single umbrella company. Currently, any company that owns a commercial bank is prohibited from owning any other financial service company such as an insurance firm or investment bank. The intent of this restriction is to prevent companies from using the commercial bank's deposits to subsidize risky investments. In reality, however, the Bank Holding Company Act has increased savings and investment costs by preventing an efficient delivery of financial services.

<p><li><b>Repeal the Banking Act of 1933 (the Glass-Steagall Act), which prohibits financial service companies from offering a full range of financial and commercial services.</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;True free-market reform would not stop at allowing only affiliations between diverse companies. Individual financial service firms should be permitted to provide a whole range of services, financial and otherwise. This can be accomplished only by repealing the Glass-Steagall Act.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is unclear whether financial service companies, if given the opportunity would choose to structure themselves as individual firms or as financial service holding companies.<sup>20</sup>  However, a single corporate structure should not be imposed by federal fiat. Instead, companies should be free to chose the structure that best suits their customers and shareholders.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are several reasons why financial modernization legislation should include repeal of both the Glass-Steagall Act of 1993 and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956: <b>First</b>, smaller financial institutions would benefit. These small companies, many serving rural communities, would find it difficult to affiliate with other financial service companies. In order to take advantage of the opportunities flowing from deregulation, small companies might have to "go it alone" and provide insurance, underwriting, and other services within the structure of an individual company.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Second</b>, economic efficiency might require an individual firm to offer a full complement of financial services. A firm with an extensive retail network could find it more advantageous to offer expanded services within its existing structure. For example, a commercial bank with an extensive branch system in place might not want to purchase an insurance company with an entirely separate network of branches. Instead, the bank might find it more efficient to expand services available at existing branches. This would benefit customers by increasing convenience and decreasing transaction costs. The most important goal of modernization should be to ensure that choices about diversification are left to individual firms and not mandated by the federal government.

<p><li><b>Eliminate federal regulatory barriers to integrated financial service provision.</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is not enough simply to remove statutory restrictions against integrated banking. Sixty years of federal regulations, rules, and tedious oversight also must be rolled back. And while statutes such as the Banking Act of 1933 and Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 have set the general framework for federal involvement in financial services, it has been the daily actions of federal regulatory agencies that have tightened the grip on America's financial system.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As with all government agencies, the federal financial regulatory agencies are slow to change. Beginning in the mid-1980s, federal regulators did begin to allow some "well-capitalized" banks to provide limited investment and commercial services. These are steps in the right direction, but because they are exceptions to the rules and are applied somewhat arbitrarily, they create distortions in the financial services market. These exclusions also complicate the regulatory structure so that similar banks with identical characteristics often are treated differently. Moreover, banks without political clout are denied the opportunity to diversify their operations and subsequently are placed at a competitive disadvantage. Finally, it is increasingly difficult for federal regulators to keep pace with changes in technology.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Rolling back the regulatory powers of the various federal financial agencies is every bit as essential as repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. Only when financial service companies are free from both statutory restraints and regulatory burdens will they be able to take full advantage of the free market.
<p>
<li><b>Allow commercial companies to offer a full range of financial services, including individual savings and checking accounts, small business loans, consumer lines of credit, and diversified investment services.</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Once existing regulations are eliminated, there will be no restrictions on the financial or investment opportunities available to commercial firms. Any future regulation or federal government action should be concerned only with securing a minimum safety net for individual depositors. Every other transaction and financial service company should be left to the free market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There has been much talk recently of creating a two-way street between insurance companies and commercial banks. True free-market financial modernization would go well beyond this to create a virtual autobahn of activity. Financial service companies should be allowed to offer any service they wish and to choose for themselves the companies with which they want to be affiliated. Likewise, commercial firms should be allowed to enter the financial market at any point that seems most advantageous for them. This integration and free entry will breed entrepreneurship, which in turn will produce lower costs and make available more consumer services.</ol>

<p>
<b>Benefits of These Recommendations</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 <b>Increase the safety and soundness of all banks.</b> First-year economics students learn that diversity helps increase stability. Likewise, any investor who desires a safe portfolio diversifies his investments. The past 60 years of financial regulation have ignored this basic economic understanding, and banks have continued to fail as a result. Integrated financial service provision will increase the safety and soundness of all financial companies by allowing them to diversify their operations just as individual investors and other commercial companies do.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;History proves that banks with diverse operations are less likely to fail than those restricted to specific activities. Research by Eugene White, for example, has demonstrated that in the 1920s, before passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, banks engaged in investment activities were less likely to fail than banks engaged solely in consumer activities (see Chart 2).<sup>21</sup>  In fact, the majority of banks that failed during the late 1920s were small banks with limited investments and activities. No witnesses testifying in 1931, including the Comptroller of the Currency, the chairman of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and numerous bank executives, mentioned securities-related activity as the cause of any bank failures.<sup>22</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A second example is provided by the failure of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. As early as 1982, analysts were predicting a bleak outlook for S&Ls. Brookings Institution economist Andrew Carron wrote that "As a result of this decline in net worth and asset values, between 15 and 27 percent of the federally insured firms in the [savings and loan] industry would find themselves in an untenable position: without drastic cost cutting, good fortune, or a cash infusion from the government, they would be unable to return to break-even operations. Ultimately, they would fail."<sup>23</sup>  Indeed, between August 1989 and the end of 1992, 642 savings and loans failed. The primary reason, again predicted by Carron, was that "[t]ax laws and regulatory practice have forced savings and loans and mutual savings banks to hold fixed-rate long-term residential mortgages as their principal assets and to accept the short-term deposits of households as their major source of funds."<sup>24</sup>  Looking back on the crisis, Alan Gart wrote that the number one reason so many S&Ls failed was "a combination of mismatched maturities of fixed-rate mortgages and variable-rate short term deposits during a period of rising interest rates."<sup>25</sup>  In other words, savings and loans were not allowed to diversify their services or their assets. As long as mortgage rates and consumer interest rates were compatible, this was not a problem. But as soon as the housing market turned sour, many S&Ls failed because they had no offsetting profitable activities.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Integrated financial service provision would allow financial service companies to diversify their investment portfolios so that downturns in one sector could be offset by upturns in others. In economics, this is known as vertical integration. Integrated financial service provision also would allow diversification of services, permitting financial service companies to move resources from inactive services to those that are active and profitable. For example, when the real estate market is in a downturn, companies could move resources from the mortgage industry to a more profitable sector, such as life insurance.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  <b>Allow regional banks a more diverse operating arena to serve their clients better.</b> Many analysts believe that financial service deregulation would drive small local banks out of business and that would be the end of personal banking. On the contrary, integrated financial service provision would allow local financial companies to expand the arena in which they operate, thereby increasing the number of services they can offer their local community. Local financial companies are best able to understand the unique needs of the communities in which they operate, and expanding the opportunities of these companies will allow them to meet their community needs more effectively.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Also, integrated financial service provision would allow many small, regional financial service companies to diversify their activities, which is inherently more stable. The evidence cited above shows that banks with diverse portfolios are less likely to fail. The reason for increased stability with diversification is simple. Diversity allows a financial service provider to offset slow times in one market area with growth in another. Diversity is the key to any stable investment strategy and should be allowed in the banking industry.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This would be particularly important in rural areas for two reasons. First, it is accepted increasingly that the future success of the American agriculture industry will depend on exports. Farmers and the agriculture community will need to take advantage of efficient foreign exchange markets, financial futures trading, and other mechanisms to increase export opportunities for their commodities. This is possible only if regional financial service companies are allowed increased access to these financial activities through integrated financial service provision. Second, regional rural banks historically have been subject to economic swings in the agriculture industry. Because current law limits banks to narrow fields of operation, such natural events as a drought or freeze can cause the failure of a rural bank limited to agriculture lending, and this failure can exacerbate the problems faced by a rural community. The ability to provide integrated financial services would allow rural financial service companies to diversify their activities, thus decreasing their susceptibility to swings in the agricultural industry.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Allow small businesses and entrepreneurs to secure capital more easily.</b> One of the primary benefits of integrated financial service provision would be the ability of commercial banks to underwrite equity for businesses. This would allow small businesses to go directly to local banks to secure equity rather than being forced to go to a separate investment bank, thus incurring higher transaction costs. Also, many investment banks today do not concentrate on reaching small businesses because of the high costs involved. Capital markets would become more accessible to all businesses, especially small or regional companies, once all financial service providers were given the option of underwriting securities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Allow greater access to capital markets for individual investors.</b> Eugene White has noted that many commercial banks entered investment banking in the 1920s because they "had established extensive retailing networks among their depositors during [World War I]. Unlike investment bankers who generally had a small clientele of the well-to-do, commercial banks had large numbers of potential customers, each of whom could invest a small amount in securities."<sup>26</sup>  These banks saw an underdeveloped market in small investors and reacted in a typical market-oriented manner until Congress prevented such a move by passing the Glass-Steagall Act.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The same opportunity exists for commercial banks today. Integrated banks would be able to take advantage of their extensive network of local branches and affiliates. Gerald O'Driscoll, Vice President and Director of Policy Analysis for Citicorp, recently wrote that "The homework banks do to process a loan application frequently duplicates that needed to write an insurance policy. Further, the distribution system is already present in every bank lobby."<sup>27</sup>  Likewise, insurance agents and other networked financial service providers would be able to offer their customers more services at lower cost. This all means that consumers who have access to a local bank or insurance agency, but not to the Internet or an investment bank, will be provided with more options when investing their savings.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Require fewer transaction costs for customers.</b> Not only would integrated financial service provision provide greater access to financial markets for all investors and businesses, but it would do so more efficiently in many instances. As mentioned above, commercial banks have an extensive network of local offices, affiliates, automated teller machines (ATMs), and branches. Accompanying this structure is a communications and managerial infrastructure that must be duplicated by a separate investment bank and a separate insurance agency. By combining these services, consumers would be able to take advantage of economies of scale.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Many of the administrative duties required by banks also duplicate those required by insurance agents or investment companies. For example, a loan mortgage application contains much the same information as a homeowner's insurance contract. Likewise, a business loan application requires much the same financial information as a request for securities underwriting. If a single financial institution could offer all of these services, many of these duplicated efforts would be eliminated and costs reduced. Reduced costs allow individuals and businesses to make more valuable purchases and more investors and entrepreneurs to enter the financial markets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Finally, integrated financial service provision would lead more financial service institutions to offer discount brokerage service, mutual funds, and other similar opportunities. Many individuals unable to reach these markets in the past because of high transaction costs were forced to settle for a single savings vehicle, even if that vehicle was not ideally suited to their needs. These investors, often of the lower working class, would be able to access a greater selection of investments and would soon realize a higher rate of return on their savings. Additionally, the market in general would perform more efficiently because a larger part of aggregate savings would be invested in more efficient and profitable avenues.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  <b>Allow capital to flow through the American economy more efficiently.</b> Many economists believe that prohibiting integrated financial service provision is a drag on the American economy because savings are not allocated efficiently. As Michael Porter has written, "The United States possesses an enormous pool of investment capital. The problem lies in how this capital is allocated -- at what rates and into what kinds of investments."<sup>28</sup>  For example, restrictions on the activities of commercial banks prevent them from informing investors about the full range of opportunities available to them. Also, the transaction costs of dealing with two separate banks (one commercial and the other investment) prevent many investors from moving their capital from a less profitable investment to a more profitable one because it is simply too inconvenient. The result is that investment is not directed toward its most efficient end.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Demand and supply of capital investment would be met better if financial service companies were allowed to offer a full range of investment opportunities and commercial businesses were able to offer financial services. More investors would have access to a broader range of investment vehicles. Increased consumer selection would lead more individuals to make better choices in the investment methods they employ. And the increased competition would force financial service providers to improve the quality of their products and increase the efficiency with which they deliver those products to the market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Decrease the cost of capital faced by American companies.</b> A more efficient allocation of investment would lead to a lower cost of capital. First, transaction costs would decrease. Transaction costs constitute a significant component of the cost of capital faced by companies in the American financial market. An integrated financial services system would enable a company to complete more financial transactions through a single broker-dealer, eliminating the need for duplicate paperwork and other such administrative expenses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Closely related to a decrease in transaction costs is a more efficient allocation of economic resources. Current financial regulations, by definition, obstruct the natural market flow of capital, thus creating an inefficient distribution system. Capital would be allocated more efficiently if unhindered by artificial government barriers. A more efficient delivery system would produce less expensive capital for American businesses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Third, a closer relationship between banks and commercial interests would form because banks would be both lenders and owners of companies. A financial service provider that owns stock in a company through the underwriting process has a stake in the success of that company and is more likely to work closely with the other owners to avoid bankruptcy. Large companies also would be able to carry a greater amount of debt (in relation to equity), which would lower the cost of capital because debt is usually less expensive than equities. The lower cost of debt would lead to a lower cost of capital.<sup>29</sup>  This, and the decreased risk of bankruptcy, would produce more stable companies and lower prices.
<p>

<b>THE MYTHS AND REALITY OF REFORM</b>
<p>
<b>MYTH: Independent insurance agents will be driven out of business.</b>
<p>
<b>REALITY: The future is not bright for independent insurance agents, even without significant financial modernization.</b> Technology has made it possible for insurance companies to sell policies directly to consumers without relying on distribution by agents. For example, some insurance companies are offering their services on the Internet. This technological bridge between producer and consumer makes the independent agent an expensive -- if not unnecessary -- intermediate. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
True integrated financial service legislation would allow a single company to offer any financial or commercial service or, optionally, to affiliate with any financial or commercial entity. A "two-way street" would be created whereby commercial banks could begin to offer insurance products and insurance agents could provide banking services. Thus, insurance agents and bankers would be equally free to engage in a full range of financial services. Insurance agents, for this reason, and with the impetus of an otherwise bleak future, should support full deregulation so they can diversify their operations and increase their customer base.
<p>
<b>MYTH: Small local banks will be eliminated as large national financial service providers become more powerful.</b>
<p>
<b>REALITY: Local banks will always have a place in the financial services industry.</b> The personal service and unique products they can provide will allow small banks to fill a market niche. A recent <I>Wall Street Journal</I> article highlighted the story of Catawba Valley Bank, a new local bank opened on November 1, 1995, in Hickory, North Carolina.<sup>30</sup>  The bank, which prides itself on individual attention and local investments, was launched by Steve Aaron, who left his job as an executive officer of a large statewide bank. The story of Catawba Valley is not unique: New U.S. bank charters rose to nearly 150 in 1995, almost 300 percent more than during the previous year.<sup>31</sup>  Clearly, there is a demand for local banks that can deal with customers in a personal manner. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, integrated financial service provision would give local banks the ability to offer more services to their customers, thus increasing their ability to survive. Just as General Motors and Ford are able to offset slow sales of luxury sedans with increased sales of all-purpose trucks or gas-efficient compacts, so would financial service providers be able to offset slow mortgage loan sales with increased mutual fund investments. The increased stability of integrated financial service provision benefits not only the financial institution itself, but also the consumers. A stable financial institution precludes the cost and inconvenience of changing financial vendors and opening new accounts.
<p>
<b>MYTH: Integrated banks will make risky investments with deposited money.</b>
<p>
<b>REALITY: Economic theory and historic evidence both indicate that integrated financial service companies would make safe investments with deposited money or else pay a premium for risky activity.</b> Many investors are interested in earning a high rate of return on their deposits, and willing to accept the risk that accompanies the possibility of such a payoff. On the other hand, many investors seek a safe harbor for their funds (or at least a minimal portion of them) and prefer financial service providers that make only secure investments. And while safety-seeking investors cannot expect as high a rate of return on their deposits, they can be sure of the safety of their investments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This system is essentially a pricing system for financial services. It would operate just as the pricing of automobiles does. Buyers who want a safe car that gets good gas mileage are willing to pay more than somebody looking for the economy of a used motorcycle. The important point is that the market will deliver the services (in this case, financial investment tools) that consumers demand. And because many investors seek a secure harbor for at least part of their savings, the market will deliver financial service providers that make such secure investments possible. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The work of Kroszner and Rajan indicates that before passage of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933, commercial banks engaged in equity underwriting made more secure investments in larger businesses than did pure investment banks.<sup>32</sup>  Thus, banks free to invest in any manner they wished realized that their customers expected a degree of safety and therefore made relatively secure investments.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
<b>RECENT CONGRESSIONAL ACTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Two major reform proposals were advanced during the first session of the 104th Congress. These bills represent the third time in the past five Congresses that repeal of financial service separation laws has been attempted. Compromise legislation failed in 1988 and 1991. Both of last year's proposals would amend the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 by allowing bank holding companies to affiliate with other financial service providers, although neither bill would allow a single company to engage in a full range of financial services.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Representative Jim Leach (R-IA), Chairman of the House Banking Committee, introduced H.R. 1062, the Financial Services Competitiveness Act of 1995, on February 27. Chairman Leach's bill would allow a "financial services holding company" to own both banking and investment affiliates. This would lead to a greater integration of commercial banking and investment banking. Chairman Leach's original bill would not have allowed a financial services holding company to own an insurance affiliate, however. Also, any holding company that currently has an insurance affiliate would be required to disassociate from that firm if it wanted to acquire a commercial bank. There would be no "two-way street" and no full integration of financial services.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second bill was introduced by Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY), Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Representative Richard Baker (R-LA), Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. The Depository Institution Affiliation Act (H.R. 814 as introduced by Representative Baker) would allow a commercial bank to affiliate with any other financial services company or commercial entity, including an insurance provider or an investment bank. The D'Amato-Baker proposal, because it would allow a greater range of affiliation, would lead to greater and more efficient integration of financial services than Representative Leach's bill.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The D'Amato-Baker bill presents a much purer approach to financial service integration by allowing affiliation among all financial and non-financial companies. It also would allow greater flexibility of affiliate interaction by creating fewer "firewalls" between a holding company's affiliates. For example, under Chairman Leach's bill, senior officers of one affiliate would be prohibited from simultaneously serving as senior officers of another. The D'Amato-Baker bill would extend no such restrictions. Also, and perhaps most important, the Leach bill would require holding companies themselves to be "adequately capitalized."  The D'Amato-Baker bill would place such capitalization restrictions only on insured depository affiliates.<sup>34</sup>  The overall greater freedoms allowed in the D'Amato-Baker proposal are vital first steps toward a free-market approach to integrated financial service provision. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 Neither the Leach nor the Baker bill moved beyond the full Banking Committee in the House during 1995. The progress of both bills was stalled as representatives of the banking industry and the insurance industry failed to reach agreement on the integration of their services. This disagreement ultimately stalled all banking reform legislation. Senator D'Amato's bill was never marked up in committee as the Senate awaited action by the House.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recent Supreme Court ruling in <I>Barnett Bank v. Nelson</I><sup>35</sup> clears the way for federal banks to sell insurance in small towns. The decision held that federal laws allowing such transactions pre-empt state laws preventing insurance sales by banks. The decision has given Chairman Leach the opportunity to push for significant reform again this year. Leach also has modified his bill to allow affiliation of banks and insurance companies, thus creating a more complete integration of financial services. However, the bill still has a number of weaknesses, including burdensome firewalls and the exclusion of non-financial commercial companies from the integration process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Neither the new Leach bill (H.R. 2520) nor the D'Amato-Baker bill is perfect. Neither one would allow a single company to engage in a full range of financial service provisions. Affiliations would allow greater efficiency but not complete freedom for financial service companies. True reform would use the D'Amato-Baker proposal as a transition to elimination of all restrictions on financial integration. 
<p>
 <b>CONCLUSIONS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The financial service sector is the most ubiquitous sector of the modern American economy. Commercial and investment banks, insurance companies, securities trading markets, credit card providers, and other financial services are both the backbone of the commercial market and the fuel in the American economic engine. Every day, every American depends on the financial services sector to pay bills, purchase goods, pay for education, prepare for retirement, or create a business. For this reason, it is imperative that America secure an efficient and modern financial service system.

It is impossible to create such a system within the confines of the current statutory and regulatory structure, the guiding principles of which have not changed since the early 1930s. The impetus for change is made even stronger by the rapid pace of technological change. The current regulatory structure depends on being able clearly to define a bank, an insurance agent, and a security issue. But should a shopping mall-based ATM that can process loan applications be considered a bank?<sup>36</sup>  If so, how can a machine be accused of racial bias in its decisions?  Should an Internet World Wide Web site, through which anybody can apply for an insurance policy, be considered an agent?  And if so, how can one state regulate that web page, which is globally accessible?  Even if these questions are answered within the context of the current regulatory regime, they will be replaced by others. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The only solution is to sweep away the past 60 years of financial regulation and begin the process of market-oriented modernization. Current financial service regulations and the thinking they embody were misguided at their creation and are certainly misguided and outdated today. A free-market approach to financial deregulation also would benefit American consumers and businesses. More profitable investments would be available; capital would be easier to obtain, and its cost would be reduced; and the financial services sector would enjoy more stability and security. These advantages would resound through the economy every day as individual investors and companies took advantage of this more efficient and secure financial sector.<p><b>ENDNOTES</b><p><ol><li>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Stand for Children rally, held in Washington on June 1, called attention to the plight of the nation's children. However, the unstated, underlying goal was to defend the continuing growth of the welfare system and implicitly to criticize those in Congress who have sought to reform it. Thus, while the Stand for Children event properly called attention to the disastrous condition of America's children, it is important to recognize that children are suffering precisely because of the governmental policies supported over the last 25 years by the leading organizations promoting the rally.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The simple fact is that children are suffering because the U.S. welfare system has failed. Designed as a system to help children, it has ended up damaging and abusing the very children it was intended to save. The welfare system has failed because the ideas upon which it was founded are flawed. The current system is based on the assumption that higher welfare benefits and expanded welfare eligibility are good for children. According to this theory, welfare reduces poverty, and so will increase children's lifetime well-being and attainment. This is untrue. Higher welfare payments do not help children; they increase dependence and illegitimacy, which have a devastating effect on children's development.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Americans often are told that the current welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. This also is untrue.<ul>

<li>The 4.7 million families currently receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) already have spent, on average, six-and-a-half years on welfare.

<li>When past and estimated future receipts of AFDC are combined, the estimated average length of stay on AFDC, among those families currently receiving benefits, is 13 years.

<li>Among the 4.7 million families currently receiving AFDC, over 90 percent will spend over two years on the AFDC caseload. More than 75 percent will spend over five years on AFDC.</ul>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It is welfare dependence, not poverty, that has the most negative effect on children.
Recent research by Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill shows that increasing the length of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by as much as 20 percent.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Welfare dependency as a child has a negative effect on the earnings and employment capacity of young men. The more welfare income received by a boy's family during his childhood, the lower the boy's earnings will be as an adult, even when compared to boys in families with identical non-welfare income.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Welfare also plays a powerful role in promoting illegitimacy. Research by CBO Director O'Neill also shows, for example, that a 50 percent increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit levels will cause a 43 percent increase in the number of illegitimate births within a state. Illegitimacy, in turn, has an enormous negative effect on children's development and on their behavior as adults. Being born outside of marriage and raised in single parent homes:<ul>
<li>Triples the level of behavioral and emotional problems among children;

<li>Nearly triples the level of teen sexual activity;

<li>Doubles the probability a young woman will have children out of wedlock; and,

<li>Doubles the probability a boy will become a threat to society, engage in criminal activity, and wind up in jail.</ul>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Overall, welfare operates as a form of social toxin. The more of this toxin received by a child's family, the less successful the child will be as an adult. If America's children are to be saved, the current welfare system must be replaced. The automatic and rapid growth of welfare spending must be curtailed. Welfare should no longer be a one-way handout; recipients should be required to work for benefits received. Steps must be taken to reduce future illegitimacy, beginning with restricting cash welfare to unmarried teen mothers.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Finally, Americans must help children rise upward out of poverty and despair by enlisting the support of those institutions that have a record of real success. The evidence is clear that religious institutions have enjoyed dramatic success in reducing teen sexual activity, crime, drug use, and other problems among young people. In order to help poor children, America must rely on the healing and guiding force of the churches. This can be done by giving poor parents government-funded education vouchers which could be used to send their children to private schools, including religious schools.
<p>

<b>THE FAILED LIBERAL PARADIGM</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The liberal welfare state is founded on faulty logic. This flawed logic, embedded in nearly all liberal thinking about welfare, runs something like this:<ul>
<li><b>PREMISE #1:</b> Children in families with higher income seem to do better in life.

<li><b>PREMISE #2:</b> Welfare can easily raise family income.

<li><b>CONCLUSION:</b> Welfare is good for kids.</ul>
<p>From this logic has sprung a relentless 30-year effort to raise welfare benefits, expand welfare eligibility, create new welfare programs, and increase welfare spending. The recent reform legislation passed by Congress sought to slow the automatic growth of welfare spending. Thus, it violated the cardinal tenets of the liberal welfare system, leading to cries of alarm from the welfare establishment and a prompt veto by President Bill Clinton.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In fact, each of the central tenets of modern welfare is misleading and deeply flawed. Together, they become a recipe for a disastrous system of aid which harms rather than helps, aggressively crushing the hopes and future of increasing numbers of young Americans. It is useful to examine each of these cardinal liberal tenets individually.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>CLAIM 1: Raising incomes is crucial to the well-being and success of children.</b> The common liberal corollary to this premise is that poverty causes such problems as crime, school failure, low cognitive ability, illegitimacy, low work ethic and skills, and drug use. Hence, reducing poverty through greater welfare spending will reduce most social problems. History refutes this belief. In 1950, nearly a third of the U.S. population was poor (twice the current rate). In the 1920s, roughly half of the population was poor by today's standard. If the theory that poverty causes social problems were true, we should have had far more social problems in those earlier periods then we do today. But crime and most other social problems have increased rather than fallen since these earlier periods.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
History and common sense both show that values and abilities within families, not family income, lead to children's success. Families with higher incomes tend to have sound values concerning self-control, deferred gratification, work, education, and marriage which they pass on to their children. It is those values, rather than the family income, that are key to the children's attainment. Attempting to raise the family income artificially through welfare is very unlikely to do much to benefit the child, but it is likely to destroy the very values that are key to the child's success.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>CLAIM 2: It is very easy to raise family income through welfare.</b> This also is untrue. Because welfare reduces work effort and promotes illegitimacy and poverty-prone single-parent families, it actually may cause an overall decrease in family incomes. Welfare is extremely efficient at replacing self-sufficiency with dependence but relatively ineffective in raising incomes and eliminating poverty.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>CLAIM 3: Higher welfare benefits and broadened eligibility will help children and improve their success in later life.</b> In certain limited cases, such as when it is needed to eliminate serious malnutrition, welfare can help. But there is no evidence that enlarging benefits and expanding enrollments in most U.S. welfare programs will improve children's lives.
<p>
<b>The Truth About Welfare.</b> In contrast to the failed premises of welfare liberalism are the following hard facts about welfare and children:<ul>

<li>Except in very limited cases, such as those involving serious malnutrition, welfare programs do not yield fewer problems and better life outcomes for children.

<li>Welfare programs intended to combat poverty do not help children but do increase welfare dependence, which in turn is very harmful to children's well-being.

<li>Welfare programs intended to raise family incomes do not benefit children but do significantly increase illegitimacy and single-parent families, which in turn have decisively negative effects on children's development.</ul>

<p>Overall, the wider and more generous the welfare "safety net," the greater the problems of dependence and illegitimacy will become, and the greater the harm to children.
<p>


<b>EXAMINING WELFARE'S IMPACT ON CHILDREN</b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The available scientific evidence clearly refutes the liberal hypothesis that attempting to raise family income through more generous welfare payments will benefit children. For example, the average monthly value of welfare benefits (AFDC and food stamps combined) varies between states. The conventional liberal assumption is that children on welfare in states with lower benefit levels will be markedly worse off than children in states with higher benefits. Children on AFDC in high-benefit states, according to the theory, should have improved cognitive ability when compared to children without access to more generous welfare. However, research published in 1994 by now-Congressional Budget Office Director June O'Neill and Anne Hill of Queens College, City University of New York, demonstrates that this theory is incorrect. O'Neill and Hill examined the IQs of young children who were long-term welfare dependents, having spent at least half of their lives on AFDC. Contrary to the expected theory, they found that the higher welfare benefit did not improve children's cognitive performance. The IQs of long-term welfare-dependent children in low-benefit states were not appreciably different from those in high-benefit states.<sup>1</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Moreover, this picture is overly optimistic. In restricting the sample to long-term dependent children, the analysis ignores the effects of higher welfare benefits in encouraging welfare enrollment and lengthening the time spent on welfare. O'Neill and Hill have shown that a 50 percent increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit levels will lead to a 75 percent increase in the number of mothers with children enrolling in AFDC and a 75 percent increase in the number of years spent on welfare.<sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Once the effects of increased dependence are included, it becomes clear that higher welfare benefits have a decisively negative effect on children. Comparing children who were identical in social and economic factors such as race, family structure, mothers' IQ and education, family income, and neighborhood residence, Hill and O'Neill found that the more years a child spent on welfare, the lower the child's IQ. The authors make it clear that it is not poverty but welfare itself which has a damaging effect on the child. Examining the young children (with an average age of five-and-a-half), the authors found that those who had spent at least two months of each year since birth on AFDC had cognitive abilities 20 percent below those who had received no welfare, even after holding family income, race, parental IQ, and other variables constant. <sup>4</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	O'Neill and Hill conclude:<p><blockquote>

	Our findings of a negative impact of a welfare environment are particularly troubling. After controlling for the effects of a rich array of characteristics, a mother's long-term welfare participation is associated with a significant reduction in her child's [IQ] score and this effect is reinforced by the mother's having grown up in an underclass neighborhood, defined as one with a high proportion of welfare recipients. Although long-term welfare recipients are generally poor, persistent poverty does not seem to be the main reason for the poor performance of these children. Moreover, our analysis suggests that policies that would raise the income of children on welfare simply by increasing AFDC benefits are not likely to improve cognitive development. Children on welfare in high benefit states do not perform measurably better than their counterparts in low benefit states. <sup>5</sup>
</blockquote><p>
	<b>More Evidence on Welfare's Negative Impact.</b> A similar study by Mary Corcoran and Roger Gordon of the University of Michigan shows that receipt of welfare income has negative effects on the long-term employment and earnings capacity of young boys. The study shows that, holding constant race, parental education, family structure, and a range of other social variables, higher non-welfare income obtained by the family during a boy's childhood was associated with higher earnings when the boy became an adult (over age 25). <sup>6</sup>    However, welfare income had the opposite effect: The more welfare income received by a family while a boy was growing up, the lower the boy's earnings as an adult.1<sup>7</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Typically, liberals would dismiss this finding, arguing that families which receive a lot of welfare payments have lower total incomes than other families in society, and that it is the low overall family income, not welfare, which had a negative effect on the young boys. But the Corcoran and Gordon study compares families whose average non-welfare incomes were identical. In such cases, each extra dollar in welfare represents a net increase in overall financial resources available to the family. This extra income, according to conventional liberal welfare theory, should have positive effects on the well-being of the children. But the study shows that the extra welfare income, even though it produced a net increase in resources available to the family, had a negative impact on the development of young boys within the family. The higher the welfare income received by the family, the lower the earnings obtained by the boys upon reaching adulthood. The study suggests that an increase of $1,000 per year in welfare received by a family decreased a boy's future earnings by as much as 10 percent.<sup>8</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Other studies have confirmed the negative effects of welfare on the development of children. For example, young women raised in families dependent on welfare are two to three times more likely to drop out and fail to graduate from high school than are young women of similar race and socioeconomic background not raised on welfare. <sup>9</sup> Similarly, single mothers raised as children in families receiving welfare remain on AFDC longer as adult parents than do single mothers not raised in welfare families, even when all other social and economic variables are held constant.<sup>10</sup>
<p>

<b>WELFARE PROMOTES ILLEGITIMACY<sup>11</sup></b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The welfare system does added harm to children by promoting illegitimacy. The anti-marriage effects of welfare are simple and profound. The current welfare system may be conceptualized best as a system that offers each single mother with two children a "paycheck" of combined benefits worth an average of between $8,500 and $15,000, depending on the state. <sup>12</sup>  The mother has a contract with the government: She will continue to receive her "paycheck" as long as she does not marry an employed man.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		As long as a father and mother remain unmarried, they may obtain income from two sources: the mother's welfare and the father's earnings. However, if the parents marry they must rely on the father's earnings alone. Welfare thus has made marriage economically irrational for most low-income parents. It has transformed marriage from a legal institution designed to protect and nurture children into an institution that financially penalizes nearly all low-income parents who enter into it.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Similarly, welfare has made it possible to raise a child without either the father or the mother having to hold a job. Welfare thus has made a father with low education and skills at best financially irrelevant -- and at worst a net financial handicap to the mother and the child. Welfare has worked like an acid, slowly corroding the social foundation of marriage in low-income communities. All parties -- the father, the mother, and especially the child -- are damaged by this.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Largely because of welfare, illegitimacy and single parenthood have become the conventional "lifestyle option" for raising children in many low-income communities. As Washington Post reporter Leon Dash has shown in his book When Children Want Children, most unwed teen mothers conceive and deliver their babies deliberately rather than accidentally. <sup>13</sup> While young women do not bear unwanted children in order to reap "windfall profits" from welfare, they are very much aware of the role welfare will play in supporting them once a child is born. Thus, the availability of welfare plays an important role in influencing a woman's decision to have a child out of wedlock.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		In welfare, as in most things in life, you get what you pay for. The current welfare system pays for non-work and non-marriage and has achieved dramatic increases in both. Scientific research confirms that welfare benefits to single mothers contribute directly to the rise in illegitimate births. June O'Neill's research has found that, holding constant a wide range of other variables such as income, parental education, and urban and neighborhood setting, a 50 percent increase in the monthly value of AFDC and food stamp benefits led to a 43 percent increase in the number of out-of-wedlock births. <sup>14</sup> Other studies showing the effect of welfare in increasing illegitimacy are listed in the appendix to this paper.
<p><b>THE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF RISING ILLEGITIMACY</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	From the very beginning, children born outside of marriage have life stacked against them. The impact on the child is significant and can be permanent. Out-of-wedlock birth and growing up in a single-parent family means the child is more likely to experience:<ul>

<li>Retarded cognitive (especially verbal) development;

<li>Lower educational achievement;

<li>Lower job attainment;

<li>Increased behavior and emotional problems;

<li>Lower impulse control; and

<li>Retarded social development.
<p>
Such children are far more likely to:
<li>Engage in early sexual activity;

<li>Have children out of wedlock;

<li>Be on welfare as adults; and

<li>Engage in criminal activity.</ul>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>The absence of married parents is related to retarded development in early childhood.</b> Illegitimacy leads to delays in development. A study of black infants (aged 5 to 6 months) living in households of lower socioeconomic status in America's inner cities found that male infants who experienced "minimal interaction with their fathers" had significantly lower levels of overall mental development and lower social responsiveness for novel stimuli. <sup>15</sup>  Illegitimate children tend to have lessened cognitive development. <sup>16</sup>  <sup>17</sup> <sup>18</sup>   Many of these children have problems in controlling their activity (popularly called "hyperactivity"). This lack of control usually is an indication of problems in learning that will arise later in the child's development. <sup>19</sup> The effect on boys is greater, at least in the early years. <sup>20</sup> <sup>21</sup>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Similar findings were enumerated again in the recent 1992 National Institute of Child Health and Development summary, "Outcomes of Early Childbearing: An Appraisal of Recent Evidence." <sup>22</sup>  And such findings are in line with earlier studies. For instance, Project TALENT, a federal survey commissioned in 1960, which tracked the development of 375,000 high school students from 1960 through 1971, found that children born outside marriage were likely to have lower cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves. Once again, all of these effects were greater for boys. <sup>23</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>	The absence of married parents risks emotional and behavioral problems during childhood.</b> The effects of illegitimacy continue to compound through childhood. The National Health Interview Survey of Child Health (NHIS-CH) confirms that children born out of wedlock have far more behavioral and emotional problems than do children in intact married families. These problems include:<ul>

<li>Antisocial behavior --  disobedience in school, cheating and lying; bullying and cruelty to others; breaking things deliberately; failure to feel sorry after misbehaving;

<li>Hyperactive behavior -- difficulty concentrating or paying attention; becoming easily confused; acting without thinking; being restless or overactive;

<li>Headstrong behavior -- easily losing one's temper; being stubborn, irritable, disobedient at home; arguing excessively;

<li>Peer conflict -- having trouble getting along with others, being not liked, being withdrawn;

<li>Dependent behavior --  crying too much, being too dependent on others, demanding attention, clinging to adults.
</ul>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Children raised by never-married mothers have significantly higher levels of all of the above behavior problems when compared to children raised by both biological parents. When comparisons are made between families that are identical in race, income, number of children, and mother's education, the behavioral differences between illegitimate and legitimate children actually widen. Compared to children living with both biological parents in similar socioeconomic circumstances, children of never-married mothers exhibit 68 percent more antisocial behavior, 24 percent more headstrong behavior, 33 percent more hyperactive behavior, 78 percent more peer conflict, and 53 percent more dependency. Overall, children of never-married mothers have behavioral problems that score nearly three times higher than children raised in comparable intact families.44 <sup>24</sup>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		Children born out of wedlock have less ability to delay gratification and poorer impulse control (control over anger and sexual gratification). They have a weaker sense of conscience or sense of right and wrong. <sup>25</sup>  Adding to all this is the sad fact that the incidence of child abuse and neglect is higher among single-parent families. <sup>26</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>	Being born out of wedlock increases the probability of teen sexual activity.</b> Boys and girls born out of wedlock and raised by never-married mothers are two-and-a-half times more likely to be sexually active as teenagers when compared to legitimate children raised in intact married-couple families. This finding applies to both blacks and whites. Children born out of wedlock whose mothers marry after the child's birth appear to be slightly less likely to be sexually active as teens but are still twice as active, on average, as legitimate teens of intact married couples. <sup>27</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The absence of married parents is related to poor academic performance during school years. The risks and consequences of illegitimacy continue through the middle years of childhood and express themselves in poor academic performance. A 1988 study by Sheila F. Krein and Andrea H. Beller of the University of Illinois finds that the longer the time spent in a single-parent family, the lower the education attained by a child. In general, a boy's educational attainment was cut by one-tenth of a year for each year spent as a child in a single-parent home. Controlling for family income did not reduce the magnitude of the effect noticeably. <sup>28</sup>  These findings are confirmed again and again in studies, conducted in the United States and abroad, which which demonstrate that illegitimacy is also associated with lower job and salary attainment. <sup>29</sup> <sup>30</sup>  <sup>31</sup> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The absence of married parents leads to intergenerational illegitimacy. Being born outside of marriage significantly reduces the chances the child will grow up to have an intact marriage. <sup>32</sup>  Children born outside of marriage themselves are three times more likely to be on welfare when they grow up. <sup>33</sup>   Daughters of single mothers are twice as likely to be single mothers themselves if they are black, and only slightly less so if they are white. <sup>34</sup>  And boys living in a single-parent family are twice as likely to father a child out of wedlock as are boys from a two-parent home. <sup>35</sup>  The TALENT study, noted earlier, already had found that children born to teenage parents are more likely to become teen parents themselves. <sup>36</sup>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>	Illegitimacy is a major factor in America's crime wave.</b> Lack of married parents, rather than race or poverty, is the principal factor in the crime rate. It has been known for some time that high rates of welfare dependency correlate with high crime rates amo
ng young men in a neighborhood. <sup>37</sup>  But more important, a major 1988 study of 11,000 individuals found that "the percentage of single-parent households with children between the ages of 12 and 20 is significantly associated with rates of violent crime and burglary."  The same study makes clear that the widespread popular assumption that there is an association between race and crime is false. Illegitimacy is the key factor. The absence of marriage, and the failure to form and maintain intact families, explains the incidence of high crime in a neighborhood among whites as well as blacks. This study also concluded that poverty does not explain the incidence of crime. <sup>38</sup>  This is a dramatic reversal of conventional wisdom.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Research on underclass behavior by Dr. June O'Neill confirms the linkage between crime and single-parent families. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, O'Neill found that young black men raised in single-parent families were twice as likely to engage in criminal activities when compared to black men raised in two-parent families, even after holding constant a wide range of variables such as family income, urban residence, neighborhood environment, and parents' education. Growing up in a single-parent family in a neighborhood with many other single-parent families on welfare triples the probability that a young black man will engage in criminal activity. <sup>39</sup><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	In vetoing the welfare reform legislation passed by the House and Senate, President Clinton has embraced the central erroneous tenets of liberal welfarism. The Clinton Administration's report on welfare, which formed the basis for the President's veto, makes clear a belief that rapid and automatic increases in welfare spending are essential to the well-being of children and that any attempts to slow the growth of future welfare spending will significantly harm children. <sup>40</sup>  The organizers of the recent Stand for Children rally share a similar view.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		The President's veto and the Stand for Children rally are both founded on the failed hypothesis that combating poverty through more generous welfare spending is crucial to children's future. This thinking is simply wrong. An expanded and more expensive welfare system will not benefit children. Instead, expansion of welfare leads to greater dependence and illegitimacy, which in turn have devastatingly negative consequences on children. Those truly concerned with the welfare of children must seek a radical transformation of the welfare system aimed not at increasing welfare spending and enrollment, but at reducing dependence and illegitimacy. That is the core of Congress's reform.
<p>
<b>APPENDIX<br>
Research on Welfare and Illegitimacy</b>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Despite repeated claims to the contrary, the overwhelming majority of scientific studies conducted in the last decade and a half show that welfare promotes illegitimacy and discourages marriage. Many show that welfare has a dramatically positive effect in increasing the level of illegitimacy in U.S. society. The following is a list of 19 studies on welfare and illegitimacy; of these, 14 have found a relationship between higher welfare benefits and increased illegitimacy.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	1. Research by Mikhail Bernstam of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University shows that childbearing by young unmarried women may increase by 6 percent in response to a 10 percent increase in monthly welfare benefits; among blacks, the increase may be as high as 10 percent. Mikhail S. Bernstam, "Malthus and Evolution of the Welfare State: An Essay on the Second Invisible Hand, Parts I and II," working papers E-88-41,42, Hoover Institution, Palo Alto, Cal., 1988.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	2. Research by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Dr. June O'Neill, has found that, holding constant a wide range of other variables such as income, parental education, and urban and neighborhood setting, a 50 percent increase in the monthly value of AFDC and food stamp benefits led to a 43 percent increase in the number of out-of-wedlock births. M. Anne Hill and June O'Neill, "Underclass Behaviors in the United States: Measurement and Analysis of Determinants," Center for the Study of Business and Government, Baruch College, February 1992.

	<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 3. A recent study of black Americans finds that higher welfare benefits lead to lower rates of marriage and higher numbers of children living in single-parent homes. In general, an increase of roughly $100 in the average monthly AFDC benefit per recipient child was found to lead to a drop of over 15 percent in births within wedlock among black women aged 20 to 24. Mark A. Fossett and K. Jill Kiecolt, "Mate Availability and Family Structure Among African Americans in U.S. Metropolitan Areas," <i>Journal of Marriage and Family</i>, Vol. 55 (May 1993), pp. 288-302.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	4. Research by Dr. C. R. Winegarden of the University of Toledo found that half of the increases in black illegitimacy in recent decades could be attributed to the effects of welfare. C. R. Winegarden, "AFDC and Illegitimacy Ratios: A Vector-Autoregressive Model," <i>Applied Economics</i> 20 (1988), pp. 1589-1601.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	5. Research by Shelley Lundberg and Robert D. Plotnick of the University of Washington shows that an increase of roughly $200 per month in welfare benefits per family causes the teenage illegitimate birth rate in a state to increase by 150 percent.

Plotnick, "Adolescent Premarital Child Bearing: Do Opportunity Costs Matter?," discussion paper no. 90-23, University of Washington, Institute for Economic Research, Seattle, 1990.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	6. Research by Dr. Martha Ozawa of Washington University in St. Louis has found that an increase in AFDC benefit levels of $100 per child per month leads to roughly a 30 percent increase in out-of-wedlock births to women age 19 and under. Martha N. Ozawa, "Welfare Policies and Illegitimate Birth Rates Among Adolescents: Analysis of State-by-State Data," <i>Social Work Research and Abstracts</i> 14 (1989), pp. 5-11.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	7. Recent research presented at a meeting at the National Academy of Sciences by Mark Rosenzweig of the University of Pennsylvania showed a reduction in AFDC payments of $130 per month could lead to a 40 percent drop in out-of-wedlock births among low income women under age 22. Mark R. Rosenzweig, "Welfare, Marital Prospects and Nonmarital Childbearing," December 1995.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	8. Another recent study finds large effects of welfare on illegitimacy. A 20 percent increase in welfare benefit levels across all states would increase the probability of teen out-of-wedlock births by as much as 16 percent. (However, the authors state that these findings should be treated cautiously because they were not proven to be statistically significant.)

Lloyd, "Marriage Markets and Non-Marital Fertility in the United States," <i>Demography</i>, May 1992, pp. 247-264.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	13. A recent study by Phillip Robins and Paul Fronton finds that higher welfare benefits lead to more births among never-married women.

	<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The following five studies found no relationship between higher welfare benefits and illegitimacy. Significantly, no study has ever found that welfare has a positive effect in reducing illegitimacy and promoting marriage.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	1. Gregory Acs, "The Impact of AFDC on Young Women's Childbearing Decisions," Institute for Research on Poverty, Discussion Paper # 1011-93. This study finds a small relationship between higher welfare benefits and total births to white women, but no significant relationship between welfare and illegitimate births. The study does, however, show that being raised in a single-parent home doubles the probability that a young woman will have a child out of wedlock.

<li>         The impact of increasing the lenience and generosity of welfare in undermining work and prolonging dependence has been confirmed by controlled scientific experiment. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, social scientists at the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) conducted a series of controlled experiments to examine the effect of welfare benefits on work effort. The longest running and most comprehensive of these experiments was conducted between 1971 and 1978 in Seattle and Denver, and became known as the Seattle/Denver Income Maintenance Experiment, or "SIME/DIME."  Advocates of expanding welfare had hoped that SIME/DIME and similar experiments conducted in other cities would prove that generous welfare benefits did not affect "work effort" adversely. Instead, the SIME/DIME experiment found that each $1.00 of extra welfare given to low-income persons reduced labor and earnings by an average of $0.80. The significant anti-work effects of welfare benefits were shown in all social groups, including married women, single mothers, and husbands. The results of the SIME/DIME study are directly applicable to existing welfare programs: Nearly all have strong anti-work effects like those studied in the SIME/DIME experiment. See: Gregory B. Christiansen and Walter E. Williams, "Welfare Family Cohesiveness and Out of Wedlock Births," in Joseph Peden and Fred Glahe, <i>The American Family and the State</i> (San Francisco: Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1986), p. 398.

<li>         A further refinement of the Corcoran and Gordon study adjusted for differences in years spent by a family in poverty. The study showed that, in general, if two families had the same level of non-welfare income and spent the same amount of time "in poverty," the more welfare income received by the family, the worse the consequences for a boy raised in the family. For example, if two boys were raised in families with identical non-welfare incomes and spent the same time "in poverty," the more welfare received by one of the families, the lower the earnings of the boy raised in that family when he becomes an adult.

<a href="bg1081b.html#ahs">What Shortage of Affordable Housing?</a>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Henry Cisneros's bold plan to introduce the benefits of market competition into the troubled public housing industry has been stymied in Congress by an alliance of moderate Republicans and liberal Democrats. Yet, despite the opposition, these ideas -- which first took hold during the Reagan and Bush Administrations (especially during Jack Kemp's tenure at HUD) -- have shown remarkable resiliency. With the support of House reformers and leaders, and with bold intervention from the federal courts, there is a good chance that these needed reforms in America's New Deal housing policies will survive lobbying efforts of a public housing industry determined to preserve its costly taxpayer-supported monopoly over housing for the poor. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ensuring this will be no easy task, however, as both the House and Senate committees with jurisdiction over housing policy already have produced bills that would reverse 25 years of market-based reform and, in the process, serve fewer needy families for the taxpayer dollars spent. The Senate's version (S.1260) has passed the floor. The companion version in the House (H.R. 2406) is scheduled for a vote in early May, but confronts a competing reform bill (H.R. 2198) developed by freshman Representatives Sue Myrick (R-NC) and Sam Brownback (R-KS). Significantly, the freshman bill is co-sponsored by the House leadership. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This clash over housing reform is far more than a dispute over spending levels. It is a dispute over how government should help the poor and a chance for the new congressional leadership to end the public housing industry's stranglehold -- a stranglehold that has hurt tenants as well as taxpayers and turned many of America's public housing projects into costly disasters. The leadership's attention, support, and intervention will be essential, both in defending reform against the public housing industry's lobbying juggernaut and in focusing lawmakers on the issues at stake.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What is at stake today is what has been at stake in every year since the early 1970s, when HUD first attempted to extract itself from the costly housing policies of the New Deal: the choice between <I>tenant-based</I> assistance and <I>project-based</I> assistance. Rent vouchers and certificates, the primary means of tenant-based assistance, provide eligible families with the cash equivalent to rent the apartment of their choice, subject to a cap based on local "fair market rents."  They empower tenants and introduce market discipline into the assisted-rental market, forcing landlords and developers to seek to provide the best value for money.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In contrast, with project-based assistance (including public housing), the eligible family is offered an apartment in a building constructed and operated exclusively to house the poor. With its origins in the Depression, project-based public housing was developed as much for its direct job-creating potential as it was to meet the housing needs of the indigent; it is this dual purpose, among other factors, that explains why project-based assistance, on average, costs up to twice as much as vouchers for each family assisted. These units typically are owned and operated by government or nonprofit organizations, although some for-profit developers have been given significant tax and other financial incentives to provide such buildings. This approach empowers landlords and developers, whose incentive is to lobby Washington and produce housing as expensively as possible, not to provide value to tenants or the taxpayer.
<p>
<b>TIME TO GIVE THE POOR A CHOICE</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The significant cost difference is one of the key reasons for the shift, under both Democrat and Republican Administrations, toward vouchers and away from public housing. But the different approaches also have led to dramatic differences in the quality of life for assisted families, and this has been another compelling reason for HUD's repeated attempts to extract itself from this Depression-era program. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Because public housing serves only the poor, typically in large complexes of a hundred or more units, families assisted by this program are rigidly segregated from the rest of society, always by income class and also by education and workforce participation. In the major urban areas, public housing residents are segregated almost exclusively by race. Indeed, one would be hard-pressed to find another American institution that induces measures of racial segregation as effectively as does public housing.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Apparently the courts agree. In April of this year, in settling a desegregation suit brought against HUD by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland on behalf of several Baltimore public housing tenants, HUD agreed to desegregate its Baltimore public housing projects, to tear down the decrepit buildings, and to provide the majority of the displaced tenants with vouchers that can be used to rent privately owned apartments within the greater Baltimore metropolitan area (see <a href="bg1081b.html">box</a>).
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In contrast with public housing, vouchers allow the assisted family to choose its place of residence from private landlords in the community, provided that the required rent stays within the established limits. This freedom allows assisted families to escape the worst urban communities. As a 1994 congressional report observed, "Studies have found that recipients of tenant-based rental assistance were less likely than public housing residents to live in concentrated poor urban communities.... "<sup>1</sup> With vouchers, a family with children can choose a safer neighborhood with good schools; an unemployed individual can relocate to a part of the community with better job prospects; and an elderly couple can choose a place close to family, friends, and convenient shopping. Whatever their specific needs, families can "self-tailor" the assistance in ways that provide the greatest benefits for a given cost. Moreover, because vouchers are a fixed amount of assistance, tenants have a strong incentive to "shop around" for the best value, and landlords and developers have the incentive to provide good value to the tenants (which does not happen when tenants must live in designated projects). 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Recognizing these advantages, President Clinton's FY 1996 budget wisely proposed to shift virtually all housing assistance from the project-based form to tenant-based vouchers. Under this plan, HUD would end the multibillion-dollar direct payments to public housing authorities (PHAs) and replace them with indirect support through vouchers that would be provided directly to the tenants now living in these projects. In turn, the tenants could use these vouchers to continue to pay rent to the PHA, rent better quarters elsewhere, or join with other tenants to hire better managers. In any case, PHAs would lose their government-sponsored monopoly status, and instead would have to compete for assisted tenants by offering better service at a competitive price. Confronted with the prospective loss of revenue, PHAs would have no choice but to improve their performance and lower their costs.
<p>
<b>HOW A MISUNDERSTOOD STUDY DROVE A POLICY FLIP-FLOP</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The FY 1996 HUD plan was the most innovative housing proposal in 25 years and relied heavily on both privatization and competitive market forces. But Congress rejected this proposal, and instead drafted new legislation that largely shifted the housing assistance emphasis back to public housing while merely paring back some of the programmatic <I>impedimenta</I> that had accumulated over the 30 years of HUD's existence. In making this decision, both committees said nice things about vouchers but then went on to cite the findings of a June 1995 GAO report<sup>2</sup> that questioned their cost, with the Senate committee stating:
<blockquote><P>
	The Committee believes that a total conversion to a voucher system is a "One-size-fits-all" approach that is not appropriate or will not work in all markets or in all circumstances. For example, a June 1995 study by the General Accounting Office determined that while nationwide the cost of vouchers versus the cost of operating public housing is similar, the averages conceal wide differences in these two options in different market areas.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House came to a similar conclusion. It acknowledged that on average vouchers were 10 percent cheaper than public housing per household served, but added: "As GAO noted, these wide variations in cost raise a number of important issues.... "<sup>4 </sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The GAO's acknowledgement that sample observations are distributed around their mean (in other words, a bell curve) would hardly have surprised a high school math student, but this commonplace point was sufficiently alarming for both congressional housing committees to reject the HUD reform plan and continue the six-decade reliance on public housing as the primary vehicle for providing assistance to the poor. Yet the findings presented in the GAO report do nothing to support Congress's action; instead, they support the 1995 HUD proposal to "voucher out" the public housing projects.
<P>
<b>WHAT THE GAO REPORT REALLY FOUND</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the reasons HUD recommended a wholesale shift from public housing to vouchers was the significant cost difference in favor of vouchers. As acknowledged in the GAO report, HUD determined "that it cost $440 per month on average to house a family with a housing certificate, compared to an average of $481 per month in public housing."<sup>5</sup>  If spread over the 1.3 million families now in public housing, this difference, described as "similar" by the Senate, would lead to an annual savings of $640 million per year. In turn, if the savings were applied to additional vouchers, Congress would be able to assist another 118,000 poor families now eligible for HUD assistance but unable to obtain it because of limits on HUD funding.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The prospect of a GAO-acknowledged savings of $640 million alone should have encouraged Congress to begin the prompt yet orderly shift recommended by HUD Secretary Cisneros. But the GAO report presents plenty of additional information to demonstrate that the potential long-term savings from shifting to vouchers are even greater than the acknowledged 10 percent. Indeed, the true cost difference may be as much as ten times the amount HUD and GAO presented when a full accounting of all public housing costs is compiled.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For example, the same section of the GAO report that acknowledges the 10 percent difference also says, in a sentence apparently overlooked by both the House and Senate committees, that "because HUD's analysis considered the capital costs of public housing as sunk costs, it made no attempt to add an imputed debt service charge to the cost of public housing."<sup>6</sup>  <I>In other words, if we assume that public housing costs nothing to build, then public housing has only a 10 percent cost disadvantage when compared with vouchers</I>. The GAO comparison is a classic case of apples and oranges because the cost of the voucher, as related to the rent it pays, embodies all costs, including operating, capital, and debt, as well as other expenses from which public housing is exempt, such as federal, state, and local income taxes, local property taxes, and local licenses and fees. No such costs are included in GAO's representation of public housing's expenses.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Fortunately, the Senate Banking Committee and the GAO provide additional information in their respective reports that can be used to establish a fuller accounting of the costs associated with public housing and allow for a more accurate comparison of these costs with the cost of vouchers. When this is done, it is apparent that, on average, the true cost of public housing is as much as twice the cost of a voucher. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The search for a more accurate assessment of public housing's costs begins with an estimate of the federal government's investment in public housing, an investment comprised largely of the cost to construct and the cost to renovate and modernize the units periodically as they deteriorate over time. An estimate of this total is included in the Senate report, which states that "the Committee is committed to safeguarding the federal taxpayers' $90 billion investment in the nation's public housing industry.... "<sup>7</sup> 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Combining this $90 billion estimate with the GAO's observation that there are approximately 1.4 million public housing units in existence<sup>8</sup> yields an average per unit historic investment/cost of $65,000. Of course, today's per unit costs are much higher than the average of costs cumulated over past years. HUD estimates current public housing development costs at an average of $88,073 per unit.<sup>9</sup>  For example, HUD has just announced the planned construction of a new project in Washington, D.C., that will have an eye-popping estimated expenditure per unit of $186,500, and a new project in Baltimore entailing expenditures of $340,000 per unit when the cost of other amenities at the project is included.<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In order to pro rate this historic $65,000 cost over the useful life of the project, as well as establish an estimate for the costs associated with the debt service charges that would be incurred for this estimated average investment, a useful proxy is the monthly payment associated with a 30-year fixed rate, level payment, fully amortized mortgage. Using an interest rate of 7.5 percent as a conservative average for the government's long-term borrowing rate over the past several decades, this approach yields an additional monthly cost of $454.49.<sup>11</sup>  When added to the HUD/GAO monthly operating cost estimate of $481, this yields a more accurate total monthly public housing unit cost of $935.49, a figure that is more than twice the cost of vouchers. Using the current cost of building a new public housing unit -- $88,073 -- the monthly debt service charge would rise to $615.82 and the total monthly cost of that new unit would be $1,096.82.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With a cost difference of this magnitude between the two programs, the rationales for the policies embodied in both the housing bills developed by both the Senate and House committees (S. 1260 and H.R. 2406) fall apart. Specifically:
<p><blockquote>
<b>1. Vouchers are by far the better form of assistance. </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With full program costs exposed as not "similar," public housing no longer merits the benefit of the doubt, and vouchers no longer deserve the skepticism that characterizes their treatment by Congress. As a result, the policy emphasis in both these bills must be reversed and the burden of proof placed on public housing, not on vouchers. Specifically, vouchers should be the chief vehicle for housing assistance, except when a particular public housing project is not used as a vehicle for racial segregation and can be demonstrated to be less expensive as a result of an independent audit covering <I>all</I> costs.
<p>
<b>2. There are no regional cost differences of consequence once total costs of public housing are included. </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If public housing overall is twice as expensive as vouchers, the assertion that there are widespread regional differences in costs is also invalid. When the excluded capital costs presented by the GAO are added, each of the examples which purport to demonstrate the lower cost of public housing actually demonstrates just the opposite; not one of these examples survives the re-estimation.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
<b>3. An independent study commission should be established to settle the cost issue once and for all. </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To date, all cost comparison studies have been conducted by institutions, or contractors to institutions, with a vested interest in the outcome of the debate. As a result, and regardless of the quality of the studies, the analysis is perceived to reflect inherent biases, or at least to be tainted with the view of its benefactor. As a congressional agency, for example, the GAO cannot be seen as wholly neutral. The reason: It carries out research according to specific requests from Members of Congress and sometimes is constrained by the requesting lawmaker in the approach it can use to explore issues and evaluate costs. Nor can studies conducted by HUD be seen as free of bias in regard to prevailing HUD policy preferences.
</blockquote><P>
<b>THROWING BAD MONEY AFTER GOOD</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While the cost differences cited above should leave no doubt that all future and incremental housing assistance should be delivered through vouchers for reasons of both cost and quality, there remains the question of how to make the best use of the existing public housing stock, estimated by GAO at 1.4 million units. Although the taxpayers have invested an estimated $90 billion, this sunk cost does not justify any further investment in the system, since spending any additional dollars on public housing reduces by more than half the number of families that can be assisted, when compared with those that could be assisted through vouchers
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Still, investing no more money in public housing does not mean that the existing stock of public housing units has no role to play in an orderly transition from New Deal paternalism to more cost-effective tenant empowerment. In its present state, but under proper management,<sup>13</sup> much of the inherited public housing stock can provide adequate and cost-effective shelter for those in need, and the assisted tenants should be allowed to live there if that is their choice. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Providing tenants with the choice, and providing <I>them</I> with the funding rather than the landlord, puts tenants in a position to get the maximum benefit from government assistance. Providers of housing, including the public housing authorities, must compete with others in offering quality services to secure their operating revenue, which previously came directly from HUD with no effective requirement that minimal quality standards be met or cost efficiencies established.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If all public housing operators were funded only by the revenues available from federally assisted rent-paying tenants, financial survival would compel these operators to provide better services. Just as important, tenant-based assistance would force public housing authorities to decide which units to continue in operation and which to close down. Units in extreme disrepair would be rejected by voucher-bearing tenants with the right to choose. Ultimately, they would be shut down, as the federal courts forced HUD to do in Baltimore, and the money that otherwise would be wasted on uneconomic modernization could be used to assist a larger number of beneficiaries directly.
<p>
<b>THE HUMAN COST OF WASTING MONEY </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is important for Members of Congress to keep in mind that federal housing assistance is not an entitlement, and that the level of housing assistance serves only a fraction of the eligible population. As the Congressional Budget Office has pointed out:
<P><blockquote>
	In 1989, the most recent year for which the detailed data used in this study were available, about 4.1 million households received assistance from the federal government in meeting their housing needs. Under the program rules in effect in 1994, almost 14.5 million additional households would have been eligible for aid; that is, their incomes were sufficiently low to qualify them. Not all of the households that were eligible, however, applied for aid, whereas many of those that did apply were placed on waiting lists because sufficient aid was not available.<sup>14</sup> 
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In other words, for every one household served by HUD, more than three eligible ones were not. Thus, within the confines of current budget limits, the money saved through program efficiencies could be reallocated to assist the most needy of the 14.5 million poor yet unserved families now on waiting lists. The per-unit expenditures of $186,500 and $340,000 for new buildings in Washington and Baltimore, noted earlier, represent an egregious waste of money and perpetuate the long waiting lists which characterize HUD programs. 
<blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Example:</b> If the $115 million that HUD intends to spend to construct just 338 new units in Baltimore was applied to vouchers, HUD could have provided a year's worth of safe and decent privately owned apartments to 21,000 of the 25,000 poor Baltimore families on the housing assistance waiting list.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given such trade-offs, Congress's continuation of new public housing funding defies reason -- and merely rewards the construction and public housing industry lobbies.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Example:</b> Consider the $2.5 billion that the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies proposes to modernize portions of the existing public housing stock. Had this been allocated directly to certificates or vouchers, this $2.5 billion could have provided needed help to more than 475,000 poor households currently on waiting lists for government housing assistance. 
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While some in Congress may defend this multibillion-dollar modernization expenditure as necessary to provide additional housing units for the poor, the government's own statistics demonstrate that it is a waste of money. According to the government's American Housing Survey (see <a href="bg1081b.html#ahs">box</a>), there are approximately 2.6 million vacant rental units in the United States, and about 39 percent of them, or just over one million, rent for $400 or less per month -- well within the $440 range of the average HUD voucher. About 49 percent, or 1.3 million units, rent for $500 or less, also within HUD's range given that most assisted tenants are expected to supplement the voucher with their own financial resources.<sup>15</sup>  In central cities, the vacancy rate is much higher because of continuing depopulation. 
<P>
<b>MORE AUTONOMY AND LESS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PHAS</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although public housing authorities are financially dependent upon the federal government for virtually all aspects of their operations, Congress has not had much success in using the leverage this dependency should provide to induce improved performance. Despite numerous financial concessions, its not-for-profit status, exemptions from all taxes, and exhortations to better management, public housing still costs more than vouchers on a per unit basis.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The difficulties that both HUD and Congress have had with public housing are underscored by the 15 percent of the units under the control of authorities formally described year after year as "distressed."  Although the Cisneros voucher plan would have transferred the hapless tenants in these units to private sector housing and put the poorly managed PHAs out of business, Congress chose instead to rely on modified versions of Washington-managed solutions. Yet, what little management and oversight of public housing there is comes from HUD. And it was Secretary Cisneros's understanding that trying to manage from Washington is not the answer that contributed to his voucher plan to replace failed central planning and management with the discipline of the competitive marketplace. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Aspects of both congressional committee bills could make this situation worse by diminishing executive branch oversight of the housing industry and key decisions in the choice of assistance. For example:
<ul><p>
<li>HUD's oversight of the PHAs would be diminished by the House committee bill's creation of an independent Housing Foundation and Accreditation Board, comprised largely of the recipients and beneficiaries of federal spending on housing. This board would establish benchmarks for local housing and management authorities, establish procedures for accrediting authorities, and classify authorities. It is through board accreditation that a PHA would become eligible to receive the proposed block grants under this bill. This proposal creates a legislative precedent by turning over executive branch spending authority to an independent board comprised of individuals whose chief qualification for eligibility is the possession of a conflict of interest.
<p>
<li>Both bills move the responsibility for determining the future course of federal housing policy from Congress and the executive branch to the PHAs by granting to PHAs the responsibility for conducting cost comparison studies on vouchers and project-based assistance. The bills then give PHAs the discretion to act on the outcome of their own studies. With so much turning on a single cost comparison, it is hard to understand how Congress can place responsibility for cost comparison studies on the bodies that stand to benefit or lose financially from the outcome of such studies. As recommended earlier, these comparisons should be conducted by a blue ribbon commission of independent experts. 
  </ul><p>
<b>DISTORTING THE PROGRAM TO MAKE IT WORK</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While the taxpayer bears an indirect burden for having his money wasted on poorly conceived programs, the brunt of the failure is born by society's most vulnerable households, including millions of children who are condemned to live in these public housing units or, worse, are denied any housing assistance at all because billions of dollars are wasted on costly and inefficient housing programs. As noted above, the Senate's proposed $2.5 billion modernization program will be at the expense of nearly 500,000 eligible households who will receive no assistance this year because of budget shortfalls in other program accounts.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Added to this is a Republican-endorsed change in public housing regulations that will shift the government's limited housing resources away from the poorest segments of the population by allowing local public housing authorities to "serve residents with a greater range of income."<sup>16</sup>  As the Senate Committee report puts it: "The Committee's bill promotes mixed-income conditions by repealing federal regulations that prescribe strict occupancy preferences and deregulating well-run public housing authorities."<sup>17</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If these proposed changes are enacted into law, the government's long-standing commitment to use its limited housing assistance funds to help those in greatest need first will be rejected in favor of policies that enforce notions of economic diversity. With 14 million eligible but unserved households, of which about 8.4 million are categorized by the CBO as "very low income renter households,"<sup>18</sup> this policy change, at least on the surface, would appear to be ethically odd. But upon closer inspection, it can be justified by the sort of "burn the village to save it" logic often compelling in the narrow factual confines in which government discourse is engaged.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although they have not yet been enacted into law, HUD has wasted no time in putting these ideas into practice. In announcing, in early April 1996, a grant of $25 million to build 134 new units (equaling $186,500 per unit) near the U.S. Capitol, HUD also noted that households with incomes as high as $78,430 would be eligible to move into this project.<sup>19</sup>  HUD made no mention of its plans for the 15,983 poor people in the District of Columbia who are on government waiting lists for housing assistance.<sup>20</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As noted earlier, one of the more serious drawbacks of public housing, and indeed of any government bricks and mortar housing program, is that it serves to segregate households by race and income. By warehousing such large concentrations of the poor, often in deteriorated inner-city neighborhoods where much of the nation's urban public housing is located, Congress has created volatile social environments characterized by high crime, drug abuse, child neglect, and other social pathologies that tend not to occur as frequently with the less costly voucher program that allows assisted households to self-integrate into the community at large. But rather than blame a fundamentally flawed program, Congress blames the victims, and proposes to solve the problem by serving fewer of the poor.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House committee bill would allow public housing authorities, once compelled to take the poorest and most vulnerable on a priority basis, to rent to higher income families, and would require that no more than 25 percent of a project's units be dedicated to the very poor, characterized as those with incomes below 30 percent of the area's median family income. Expressed another way that better quantifies the human cost of the proposed change, Congress will allow public housing authorities to set aside no more than 350,000 units to serve a population that the CBO estimates at 11.9 million eligible households, of which about 8.4 million receive no housing assistance at all, in part because of programmatic financial limits. With public housing authorities allowed to discriminate against the poor, the worsening situation will likely deteriorate even further.<sup>21</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However bad some of the housing legislation before Congress may be, there remains the growing possibility that federal courts increasingly will render efforts now underway by Congress and HUD as irrelevant and in violation of the law. As court-directed settlements in Baltimore and several other communities demonstrate, tenants and their legal counsel are becoming increasingly less tolerant of the pervasive <I>de facto</I> segregation that characterizes most of HUD's urban public housing projects, and many of the suburban ones as well. Increased use of vouchers is the only acceptable alternative to the plaintiffs, and to the courts which render the final decision. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But as the Baltimore case also demonstrates, decisions by the courts also can be remarkably coercive, and could ultimately be as disruptive and as counterproductive as were the school busing decisions of a past generation. But this need not happen if Congress enacts a new initiative that breaks with past housing policy and the federally financed <I>de facto</I> racial segregation that is an integral part of it. Legislative proposals such as those of Representatives Myrick and Brownback, or HUD's plan of last year, each of which is founded on tenant choice, would be consistent with American principles of civil liberties. In contrast, the legislation produced by the housing committees of both the House and Senate simply entrenches today's disastrous programs and further frustrates reform.

Given the exceptional wear and tear that the typical public housing unit is subject to, a shorter period of, say, 15 or 20 years would be more reasonable and also would lead to a higher monthly cost estimate.  As for the interest rate, this also allows the analysis to err on the conservative side inasmuch as the average 30-year government bond rate was 9.2 percent for as long as there has been a 30-year bond (since 1977).  Obviously, this too would yield a higher monthly cost.  Alternatively, using the 10-year government bond rate, whose series goes back to 1953, a time span that more closely parallels the construction of today's public housing stock, the average 10-year interest rate is 6.8 percent, and this would yield a monthly debt service cost of  $423.79, making public housing still the most expensive form of housing assistance.<p>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When President Clinton vetoed welfare reform last year, he also vetoed significant adoption reforms included in the package. Congress will soon take up the adoption issue again in the Adoption and Stability Act of 1996 (<a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.r.03286:">H.R. 3286</a>), sponsored by Representative Susan Molinari (R-NY).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The key component of this bill is a $5,000 tax credit to encourage adoption. This tax relief is phased out gradually for families with annual incomes between $75,000 and $110,000. Beyond ending inequities in interracial and Indian adoptions, the bill also permits employees to deduct from their taxes up to $5,000 in employer assistance for additional adoption expenses. These reforms are financed by changes in foreign trust law and in energy subsidies, both mechanisms also approved by the House and Senate last year.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The $5,000 tax credit, which may be spread out over five years, defrays a significant portion of the costs of adopting a child and is a bargain to taxpayers who now pay an average of $13,000 per year to foster a child.<sup>2</sup>  But the bill still does not allow the credit to apply to payroll taxes, and thus prevents families who adopt but pay less than $1,000 in federal taxes each year<sup>3</sup> from benefiting from the adoption tax credit. These are precisely the families who need help the most.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Ending Discrimination.</b> H.R. 3286 removes obstacles to interracial adoption by penalizing, with a decrease in funding, any state that refuses to allow any person to adopt a child regardless of race or color. It also ends an unjust application of the Indian Child Welfare Act. Today, parents who are totally or partially Indian and have not maintained close contact with their tribe may have the adoption of their child by non-Indian parents blocked. This can be achieved by admitting the child or one of the parents to full membership in the tribe, even after the adoption has taken place. In the future, under H.R. 3286, unless one of the parents maintains a significant affiliation with the tribe, adoption by non-Indian parents may not be blocked.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Other reforms are needed in the adoption and foster care system if the rate of adoptions is to increase. Removing the barriers to adoption in the social service bureaucracy is the most significant of these remaining reforms.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption rates have declined in recent decades as adoption has fallen out of favor with state governments and the social services establishment. In 1979, 598,000 babies were born out of wedlock; almost one in four was adopted. In 1991, of the 1,225,000 born out of wedlock, only one in 25 was adopted (see <a href="bg1080c1.gif">Chart 1</a>). Yet public interest has increased: close to two million couples would like to adopt these children. Clearly, the problem is far more basic than any financial burden that may be involved.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of the vast need for adoption and the large pool of parents willing to adopt, Congress not only should encourage adoptions through generous tax relief for adopting parents, but also must change the public social service ethos by eliminating all barriers to speedy and permanent adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The simplest and fastest way to bring about these improvements is to privatize all adoption services. Government agencies have institutional strengths in applying and enforcing the law, but private institutions can better harness the human qualities needed to nurture and develop children. To encourage adoption through private organizations, and to reduce barriers to adoption through government agencies, Congress, the Administration, and the states need to take several important actions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What the federal government should do:
<P><ul>
<li>Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 for non-recurring adoption expenses.
<p>
<li>Hold hearings on the Clinton Administration's blocking of a very effective drug testing and treatment program for cocaine-addicted pregnant mothers. If necessary, pass legislation to reverse the Administration's action.
<P>
<li>Issue annual report cards on the rate of adoption in each state.
<p>
<li>Require federally funded family planning services to provide clear and accurate information on the benefits of adoption to all out-of-wedlock teenage mothers.
<p>
<li>Make it easy for all churches, particularly black churches that serve the poor, to affiliate with adoption agencies and become involved in the adoption process as outreach to prospective adopting parents.
<p>
<li>Ensure the civil rights of all children in foster care and modify the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to prohibit any use of race or ethnicity to deny or delay the placement of a child for foster care or adoption.
<p>
<li>Change the Indian Child Welfare Act to curtail the reach of Indian Nation law over those who have emigrated from those communities and societies.
<P>
<li>Reject the language in the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What the states should do:
<ul><p>
<li>Privatize adoption services.
<p>
<li>Change the way public welfare agencies are financed so that they are obliged to contract for all public adoptions.
<p>
<li>Establish separate units at the county level to assist the courts in making speedy and appropriate judgments.
<p>
<li>Maintain special Medicaid coverage for all special-needs adopted children.
<p>
<li>Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions.
<p>
<li>Use leadership opportunities to encourage adoption.
<p>
<li>Establish separate units for termination of the parental rights of convicted abusing parents.
<p>
<li>Enact a strict 12-month timeline for adjudication of the long-term parental status of every child in foster care.
<p>
<li>Centralize the collection of state data on all formal adoptions and foster care actions.
<P>
<li>Enact legislation subjecting public social service agencies to the same licensing standards and requirements as those imposed on private adoption agencies.
<P>
<li>Mandate drug testing of pregnant mothers suspected of drug abuse, particularly cocaine abuse.
<p>
<li>Prohibit the removal of a child eligible for adoption from foster parents who are willing to adopt, except when the child is being returned to his legal parents. Enact legislation to permit foster parents to initiate adoption proceedings.
<p>
<li>Enact laws requiring child welfare agencies to initiate adoption proceedings for any child who has been abandoned by his parents for six months.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption works. It increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money for the public. It brings much happiness, both to the adopting parents and to the adopted child. It is good for all involved.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The current welfare reform debate in Congress offers one of the best chances in decades to promote adoption. Sharply rising out-of-wedlock births add steadily to the long-range costs of welfare, because being born out of wedlock significantly increases the chances of ending up on welfare. At the same time, up to two million couples waiting to adopt frequently find themselves hamstrung by government agencies and government practices.
<p>
<b>THE NEED FOR ADOPTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the past 25 years there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of children born out of wedlock, children being raised by single parents, families on welfare, and children entering the foster care system because of abuse and neglect. Family disintegration is widespread. There also has been a sharp decrease in the number of children being adopted, with formal adoptions dropping by almost 50 percent: from 89,000 in 1970 to a fairly constant 50,000 annually throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to Christine Bachrach, now Director of the Demographic and Behavioral Sciences Branch of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), adoption has declined since the early 1970s primarily because of a drop in the proportion of white mothers who place their babies for adoption. Birth mothers who have continued to place their babies for adoption are more likely to have well educated mothers, are still at school,  have never worked, and are older. Also, they are more likely to place daughters for adoption than sons. Levels of adoption have remained low for blacks and are virtually non-existent for Hispanic women.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Women likely to adopt tend to be married, sterile,<sup>6</sup> and 30 years of age or older. Nearly half of all women with these characteristics have adopted.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Council for Adoption estimates that of the 50,000 children adopted annually, 25,000 are healthy children under age two, 10,000 are healthy children over age two, and 15,000 are children with "special needs" (the social work term of art for children considered difficult to place because of their age, physical or mental condition, race or ethnicity, or need to be placed with siblings).<sup>8</sup>  About one-third of these adoptions are arranged by government-funded and government-managed public agencies, some by contract with private agencies. Another one-third are arranged by private, mostly nonprofit agencies, and the rest are contracted outside of agency auspices, mostly through lawyers in private practice. International adoptions accounted for an additional 8,000 adoptions during 1994.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption fell out of favor among social workers during the 1970s, even as single parenthood and abortion became more widespread. Advocates of government-sponsored social programs argued that increases in welfare would make it possible for unmarried mothers to rear children without the assistance of a father.<sup>9</sup>  Yet, as is evident from the skyrocketing foster care numbers<sup>10</sup> and from the chronic problems associated with the absence of fathers, such as crime, poor school performance, poor health status, and low income,<sup>11</sup> that view has turned out to be a tragic mistake. By contrast, children adopted by two parents are doing as well as their peers raised in their own intact families.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
<b>PATTERNS OF PARENTAL NEGLECT </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The rapid increase of illegitimacy and the staggering problems of children born out of wedlock and raised without fathers are well documented.<sup>13</sup>
<p><ul>
<li>In 1991, 29.5 percent of all births and 68 percent of minority births were out of wedlock.<sup>14</sup>  In 1970, 10.7 percent of all children and 37.6 percent of minority children were born to unmarried mothers.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1986, 66 percent of unintended pregnancies ended in abortion and 33 percent ended with a woman choosing to be a single parent. Only 1 percent ended in adoption.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1992, 659,000 children were in state-sponsored foster care and institutional care for all or part of the year. On any given day, half a million American children live in government-sponsored substitute care.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1982, 7,100 infants were in substitute care outside their homes; in 1988, there were over 17,000.
<p>
<li>In 1991, 2,000 children died from abuse or neglect. Some were murdered. Between 30-50 percent of children killed by their parents or caretakers were known to child protective services before their murders took place.<sup>18</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There has been a sharp increase in the number of infants abandoned by their frequently drug-addicted mothers. According to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), 12,000 infants were abandoned in 1991.<sup>19</sup>  In response to this crisis, there has been a proliferation of "boarder baby"<sup>20</sup> homes to care for these children until their parents can be located and rehabilitated. A 1993 General Accounting Office report showed that 10,000 infants were being boarded in hospitals for no medical reason. Less than 40 percent of the boarder babies -- and none of the abandoned babies -- were expected to leave in the care of their parents.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The average total cost of caring for these babies in hospital after their medical treatment is almost $13,000.<sup>21</sup>  Nonetheless, only 2.5 percent of the boarder babies and 6 percent of the abandoned infants were expected to go into adoptive placements.<sup>22</sup>  The vast majority of these children will spend years in and out of the foster care system while the biological mother attempts to get her life together.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Federal efforts to deal with this have been small and swamped by the size of the problem.<sup>24</sup>  When Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL) introduced the At-Birth Abandoned Infants Act (H.R. 2936) in 1994 to help move abandoned babies out of the system and into permanent adoptive homes, the child welfare establishment lobbied against it, arguing that creating a two-tiered system -- a fast track for new-born abandoned babies and a slower, less responsive one for older children -- was unfair.<sup>25</sup>  The bill was not enacted.
<p>
<b>WHY ADOPTION SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED</b>
<p>
<b>Benefits for Children</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adopted children do as well as or better than their non-adopted counterparts, according to a 1994 study by the Search Institute, a Minneapolis-based public policy research organization specializing in questions of concern to states and cities.<sup>26</sup>  This study, the largest examination of adopted adolescents yet undertaken, concludes that:
<p><ul>
<li>Teens who were adopted at birth are more likely than children born into intact families to live with two parents in a middle-class family.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted children score higher than their middle-class counterparts on indicators of school performance, social competency, optimism, and volunteerism.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted adolescents generally are less depressed than children of single parents and less involved in alcohol abuse, vandalism, group fighting, police trouble, weapon use, and theft.<sup>29</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted adolescents score higher than children of single parents on self-esteem, confidence in their own judgment, self-directedness, positive view of others, and feelings of security within their families.<sup>30</sup>
<p>
<li>On health measures, adopted children and children of intact families share similarly high scores, and both those groups score significantly higher than children raised by single parents.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted children do well at school. In 1981, only 7 percent of children adopted in infancy repeated a grade, while 12 percent of children living with both biological parents repeated a grade.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<li>Compared with the general child population, children placed with adoptive couples are better off economically. Their parents are better educated and older than the parents of other children.<sup>33</sup>
<P>
<li>Adoptive parents are less likely to divorce.<sup>34</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Virtually all of these findings have been replicated by Nicholas Zill, Vice President and Director of Child and Family Studies at Westat Research Corporation of Maryland, in his analysis of data from the federal government's 1988 National Health Interview Survey on Child Health.<sup>35</sup>  Results from the survey were compared across four groups: adopted children, children of unmarried mothers being raised by the mother, children of intact families, and children being raised by their grandparents. The data indicated that adopted children:
<p><ul>
<li>Enjoy a quality of home environment superior to all the other groups;<sup>36</sup>
<p>
<li>Have superior access to health care compared to all the other groups;<sup>37</sup>
<p>
<li>Enjoy health similar to that of children of intact families and superior to that of the other two groups; and
<p>
<li>Do better in educational attainment than single-parent children and children raised by grandparents.<sup>38</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When compared with those adopted later, born outside of marriage and raised by the single mother, or raised in an intact family, children who are adopted in infancy:
<ul><p>
<li>Repeat grades less often than any other group;
<p>
<li>See mental health professionals less than all other groups, except children of intact families;
<p>
<li>Have better health status than all other groups;
<p>
<li>Have a better standing in their school classes than all other groups, except children raised in intact families; and
<p>
<li>Have fewer behavior problems than all other groups, except children raised in intact families.
</ul><P>
<b>Benefits for Mothers Who Give Up Children for Adoption</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Significantly, teenage mothers who choose adoption also do better than mothers who choose to be single parents.
<ul><p>
<li>They have higher educational aspirations, are more likely to finish school, and less likely to live in poverty and receive public assistance than mothers who keep their children.<sup>39</sup>
<p>
<li>They delay marriage longer and are more likely to marry eventually.
<p>
<li>They are more likely to be employed 12 months after the birth and less likely to repeat out-of-wedlock pregnancy.
<p>
<li>They are no more likely to suffer negative psychological consequences, such as depression, than are mothers who rear children as single parents.<sup>40</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All the goals of liberal government programs like job training, supplemental education, and family planning are attained with greater ease, and at lower cost, through adoption.<sup>41</sup>
<p>
<b>HOW MANY POTENTIAL PARENTS ARE THERE?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although growing numbers of children need adoption, there are more than enough families to meet the demand. The National Council for Adoption estimates that at least one million infertile couples and an additional one million fertile couples would like to adopt.<sup>42</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Christine Bachrach of NICHD concluded from the National Survey of Family Growth that over 2,000,000 women have sought to adopt at one time or another, and about 200,000 were actively seeking to adopt in 1988.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Couples who want to adopt are not looking just for healthy, Caucasian infants, despite assumptions to the contrary. The National Down's Syndrome Adoption Exchange reports a waiting list of over 100 couples who would like to adopt a child with Down's syndrome -- more than enough to accomodate parents who want Down's children given up for adoption. Nor is it difficult to find families for children with spina bifida and children who are HIV positive. For example, the National Council for Adoption is identifying children who will be orphaned when their parents die of AIDS, so that appropriate plans can be made before the parents' death. The response by individuals and families willing to adopt such children has been overwhelming.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Americans are also willing to help with children from overseas, especially because of the anti-adoption bias in the United States. When the communist regime in Romania fell, ABC-TV's "20/20" reported that thousands of children were warehoused in government orphanages. Pictures showed many children with health and developmental problems. ABC received over 25,000 self-addressed, stamped envelopes from people who wanted more information, and within six months 2,000 Romanian children were adopted by Americans,<sup>44</sup> many of whom had not considered adoption until this need became known. This suggests that the pool of parents willing to adopt could be expanded signficantly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1993, over 56 percent of the 7,348 children from other countries adopted by American parents were over the age of one. Of these, 9 percent were between the ages of five and nine, and 5 percent were over the age of ten.<sup>45</sup>  In addition, many of these foreign-born children have physical and emotional problems at the time of their adoption.<sup>46</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the evident readiness and desire to adopt, many families report a lack of support or encouragement from the social services establishment. They report such things as unanswered phone calls, inadequate networking with other agencies which may have children ready for adoption, a disinclination to identify children with needs that correspond to the gifts of the family, and a general lack of support to bring couples successfully through the adoption process.<sup>47</sup>
<p>
<b>THE BARRIERS TO ADOPTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although adoption meets the interests of the needy child better than any other option, Elizabeth Bartholet of Harvard Law School concludes that "our adoption system has failed to live up to even its own limited vision.... Laws and policies that are supposed to protect children have created barriers to adoption that function effectively to prevent these children from getting the kind of protection they most need 'a loving, nurturing and permanent home.'"<sup>48</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The legal system often resolves cases in ways that trouble many Americans. In two widely publicized recent cases, for example, children were wrested from their adoptive parents on the basis of biological ties. Baby Jessica was given to her biological father, who had failed to support two previous children, and Baby Richard was given to his biological father, with whom he had never lived, instead of being allowed to remain with the adoptive family which had nurtured him from birth for three years. In both cases, the overriding "biological ties" of the fathers prevailed over the needs of their children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Several barriers make it very difficult for many families to adopt children.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #1: Anti-Adoption Bias in Pregnancy Counseling</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Only 1 percent of women who experience an "unwanted pregnancy" choose adoption for their children.<sup>49</sup>  A University of Illinois study explains some of the causes:
<ul><p>
<li>Some 40 percent of individuals in a variety of settings (health, family planning, social services, and adoption agencies) who identify themselves as "pregnancy counselors" do not even raise the issue of adoption with pregnant clients.
<p>
<li>An additional 40 percent provide inaccurate or incomplete information to clients.
<p>
<li>By contrast, 38 percent of the clients whose counselors offered adoption went on to choose adoption.<sup>50</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress's efforts to require adoption information and counseling in one federally funded program providing services to pregnant women have met with resistance from family planning professionals. For instance, the Adolescent Family Life Act<sup>51</sup> was passed in the early 1980s to provide a modest ($7.8 million), more "pro-life," adoption-friendly alternative to the pregnancy counseling provided by established Title X and Title XIX family planning services (typically over $300 million per year). The bias among professionals against adoption can be seen in the evaluation of the program's effectiveness. Some 7 percent of the grantees violated the most basic terms of their grants by not providing any information on adoption to their clients. Most grantees failed to provide either adequate adoption information or counseling.<sup>52</sup>
<p>
<b>BARRIER #2: Misuse of the Foster Care System</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1980, Congress enacted P.L. 96-272, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act. This legislation sought to provide permanent homes for children at risk of abuse and neglect by establishing a hierarchy of services for these children and for their families. In order of priority, these services were:
<p>
1. Family preservation;
<p>
2. Short-term foster care with a goal of family reunification; and
<p>
3. Long-term foster care or adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This legislation requires that each child's situation be reviewed every six months. Within 18 months of opening every case, a permanent plan for the child's future must be in place. This placement plan embodies a decision by the child welfare agency as to whether the child will be returned to the family or placed for adoption. Such decisions and plans must be in place before the work of clearing the child for adoption can be undertaken. Only after both steps have been taken can the search for adoptive parents begin.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the 1980s, these permanency planning guidelines evolved into the operating principle of "family preservation" -- keeping families intact through early, intense, comprehensive social services. The goal was to keep families united and thus avoid the high costs of foster care.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of their own high costs, however, family preservation services cannot be sustained for long periods; and because of high demand, caseworkers move quickly to take care of the next family in crisis. This approach did succeed in stopping the removal of children from the home, but not necessarily in preserving them from further abuse.<sup>53</sup>  In fact, there is evidence that children fare worse under these new practices. In New York City alone, during the 12 months of 1992, 21 children were killed by a parent or mother's boyfriend after the Child Welfare Administration had intervened.<sup>54</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A study by John Schuerman and his colleagues at the University of Chicago found that the "Family First" program did not realize even its central goal: preventing the removal of children.<sup>55</sup>  Neither did it protect children from further abuse. There is evidence that some families continue to abuse their children even during the period of intensive state intervention.<sup>56</sup>  By contrast, there is strong evidence that children do better when left in foster care than when they are returned to abusive families.<sup>57</sup>  This evidence leads to a simple and commonsense conclusion: children need a permanent home to which they can belong. For children at serious risk, an adoptive home is their best chance for real permanence.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some child advocates challenge the principle of applying the "family preservation" approach in all cases. At a 1994 conference sponsored by the National Council for Adoption at Boys Town, Nebraska, Dr. Richard Gelles of the University of Rhode Island, a pre-eminent child abuse researcher and an early and optimistic supporter of family preservation programs, presented the following paraphrased views on these practices in light of recent evaluation data:
<p><blockquote>

	There are a now a number of studies of children who were returned home only to be abused again or even killed. These studies show dramatically that some abusive parents cannot be rehabilitated.<sup>58</sup>  In these cases the appropriate care of such a child is to terminate the parents' rights as quickly as possible and place the child with a permanent caring adoptive family.
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Boys Town conference highlighted the central problem of family preservation services. The first logical step should be to assess whether the child should be removed immediately and whether the parents are likely to benefit from support services. Instead, family preservation services are assumed to be the best first treatment. Though these services are activated because of abuse to the child -- sometimes very severe abuse -- they must fail before the child can be protected from the abusing family.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The foster care system is the aggregate network of parents who work for state and local social service agencies by taking abandoned, abused, or neglected children into their homes. They receive a set amount each month with which to feed, clothe, and nurture these children. Foster parents try to function as substitute parents. Prudently, they are admonished not to expect that placement will be permanent. However, from among the couples who take on this work come many who would like to adopt, particularly as they get to know these children and their lack of prospects for a happy and safe life in their families of origin.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Government funding reinforces an anti-adoption bias by supporting "family preservation" programs with free technical assistance and generous grants while providing only restricted support for adoption. The National Council for Adoption and the Institute for Justice report that numerous families, including foster families, have had their attempts to adopt waiting children rebuffed by the social service agencies for whom they work.<sup>59</sup>  Conna Craig of the Institute for Children in Boston reports receiving hundreds of letters from foster parents who are willing and able to adopt their foster children, some of whom have been eligible for years.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #3: Overload and Confusion of Social Service Roles</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to Douglas J. Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute, the rising incidence of reported child abuse keeps local child welfare agencies extremely busy on policing activities, diverting time and resources from adoption.<sup>60</sup>  Often the same staff must investigate abuse reports, provide family preservation services, file for the termination of parental rights, and recruit and prepare adoptive families.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The child welfare system typically does not separate the responsibility for terminating parental rights of parents who continue to abuse and neglect their children from the responsibility to help those parents who can be helped. Deaths of children result, as in the cases of the 21 who died in New York in 1992. By contrast, in Arizona and Oregon, separate professional units are used to make initial determinations and to justify the necessary court proceedings. Professionals are not trapped in the role confusion caused by simultaneous demands to reunite every family while also protecting the child.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If units like those in Arizona and Oregon were in general use, a number of benefits would result:
<P><ul>
<li>Courts could separate those children more decisively and quickly from parents unlikely to reform or benefit from family preservation services.
<p>
<li>Children in danger of severe abuse would be separated more quickly and expertly from their families and made available for adoption.
<p>
<li>Social workers involved in helping the more tractable parents would be free to pursue that work with much less likelihood of endangering the child.
<p>
<li>Local government agencies could turn to the adoption services of nonprofit agencies much more quickly and frequently. Private agencies do not have the immense burden of child protective services and related policing requirements that public agencies have. Their mission is to recruit and prepare adoptive families, and they tend to have great expertise in this work.
</ul><p>
<b>BARRIER #4: Unsatisfactory Protection of Confidentiality</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
State adoption laws generally guarantee the confidentiality of the identity of the mother, the inviolability of the internal intimacy and harmony of the adoptive family, and the peaceful development of the adopted child.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In adoption law and philosophy, there has arisen a view which parallels the modern revisionist view of marriage and parenthood embodied in "no-fault" divorce. New relationships between parent and child are imagined, and a new type of contract is forged between parents. Open adoption is akin to no-fault divorce, and the "birth parents" take on the role of the visiting parent who has not yielded up all his rights to the child, particularly rights of visitation and vacations together. The adoptive parents are bound not just to their adopted child, but also to the birth parents and must facilitate the continuing relationship between the child and his birth parents. This form of open adoption exists in Oregon from birth and in Indiana for children over two years of age.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Open adoption provides no seal of confidentiality regarding the identity of the birth parents, the adopting parents, and the child. It essentially blends birth families with adopting families, directly undermining the creation of a permanent new family for a child. The professional literature shows a frequent confusion of roles when the birth family continues a relationship with the child. This also interferes with parent and child bonding<sup>61</sup> in the adoptive family and inhibits the birth parents' grieving process.<sup>62</sup>  There are parallel experiences and research findings with respect to divorce and the increased risks of being raised in blended families.<sup>63</sup>
Confidentiality, especially in infant adoptions, helps minimize these risks.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Oregon is an example of a state in which open adoption allows birth parents to take adoptive parents to court to uphold visitation agreements. This policy undermines the rights of adoptive parents to make parenting decisions. It also changes the nature and dynamics of a close, intact, inviolably intimate adoptive family, exposing it to the disruptions, conflicts, and anxieties characteristic of divorced and blended families. The professional literature on childhood emotional and behavioral development shows that children of blended families do less well than children of single parents and intact families.<sup>64</sup>  If successful, the growing push for open adoption<sup>65</sup> could cause similar difficulties for adopted children, undermining the generally strong mental health reported by the Search Institute and Nicholas Zill.<sup>66</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Proponents of open adoption even recommend abolishing adoption in favor of "guardianship," which does not offer the same permanency of family for the child.<sup>67</sup>  Like any other government policy which treats the adoptive families differently from intact families, this undermines the very essence of adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Understandably, many children become interested in knowing about their birth parents as they reach early adulthood. Their desire may be fulfilled if everyone involved is prepared to cooperate in lifting the veil of confidentiality. Most states try to maintain confidentiality if there is not full agreement among all concerned. Others do not. Two, Alaska and Kansas, will release the original birth certificate with the names of the biological parents to the adopted person after the age of eighteen, regardless of the birth mother's desires.<sup>68</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Proponents of opening adoption records seek legislation at the federal level. Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) has introduced various versions of a "national reunion registry" to help connect birth parents with persons who are adopted. The National Council for Adoption and many of its affiliated private adoption agencies have challenged the vagueness of the legislative proposals which do not assure confidentiality. They also have questioned the need to federalize a state issue.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #5: Unknown, Uninvolved, or Unmarried Fathers</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another major barrier for unmarried women considering adoption for their children is the need to obtain the consent of uninvolved fathers. Fortunately the Supreme Court, in a series of opinions,<sup>69</sup> has clarified and restricted the rights of uninvolved, unmarried fathers. According to current federal law, these rights correspond to the effort the father has made to establish a relationship with his child. The unmarried father who is unknown, is uninvolved, or has otherwise demonstrated no responsibility or interest in the child may not be entitled to the same consideration as an involved and responsible unmarried father. Federal courts have ruled consistently<sup>70</sup> that ignorance of a pregnancy is no excuse for uninvolvement, because the father was present at conception and could have followed through to assure adequate care for the child. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A growing trend in state legislatures, upheld by the Supreme Court in <I>Lehr v. Robertson</I>,<sup>71</sup> is the establishment of father registries which make the father responsible for asserting his parental rights. The registry usually requires the father to file a paternity action within 30 days of the child's birth. This will result in his being notified of a pending adoption. He then will have an opportunity to demonstrate that he has tried to establish a relationship with the child and to take responsibility for the child's care. If he fails to meet any of these requirements, he forfeits his rights to contest the adoption of the child, and the adoption can proceed. While many conservatives think an absent unmarried father should never be an obstacle to adoption, this procedure at least frees the mothers to place children without registered fathers for adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House welfare bill requires paternity establishment at birth for all fathers. This is a major step in the right direction. Fears that efforts to locate unknown, unmarried fathers will slow down, and possibly stop, adoption are unfounded. If the mother is not seeking AFDC support (and she will not if she is placing her child for adoption), she will not need to identify the father. Simultaneously, the putative father registry protects the due process rights of all fathers. Those who do not register, however, cannot benefit from the protection it would have given them.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #6: Race of the Child and Adoptive Parents</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Two forms of racial discrimination take place within adoption: against adoptive parents and against children waiting to be adopted. Potential black parents lose the chance to give their love to needy children of their own race. Black children in foster care are deprived of new parents and a stronger foundation in life, in addition to being exposed to the risks of retarded social and intellectual development. Both forms of discrimination must be eliminated. Fortunately, the means to accomplish this already exist within the private sector. There is no need for coercive race-matching legislation.
<P>
<b>THE SPECIAL PLIGHT OF BLACK CHILDREN</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Interracial adoptions account for about 8 percent of adoptions and consist primarily of adoptions of black children by white parents.<sup>72</sup>  There are more black children waiting in foster care than there are prescreened black families ready to adopt them. With the need for permanent adoptive homes growing more acute and the exit rate from foster care slowing continually, the likelihood of multiple placements for black children increases.<sup>73</sup>  Indeed, some 24 percent of the children in foster care today have been in three or four different homes.<sup>74</sup>  According to Ira Schwartz of the University of Michigan, 53 percent of all children in Michigan who entered the foster care system as newborns are still in foster care at age four.<sup>75</sup>  A number of regional studies confirm this trend and demonstrate that black children typically wait two to three years longer than white children for adoptive homes.<sup>76</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The length of stay in foster care is very important. The longer the newborn stays in foster care, the more at risk he is of approaching the "difficult to adopt" age and the greater the problems associated with long-term foster care become. If half the children who arrive in foster care at birth are still in it at age four, the system is not serving their needs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This statistic highlights the need for termination units -- specialized units of social workers who work with the courts to determine whether the parental rights of an abusing or neglectful parent should be withdrawn so that the child may be placed for adoption. If the "best interest of the child" principle is used, this decision will be made quickly. If the "family preservation" principle is used, the decision will be delayed again and again, often until repeated neglect convinces the authorities that parental rights must be removed. At this point, in addition to having suffered even more, the child is older and more difficult to place.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given these figures, public welfare agencies are a major source of neglect of young black children. The bias against adopting early, when the child is most adoptable, feeds the foster care system and ensures a larger clientele for public agencies. The present system of financing foster care and not financing adoptions perversely rewards this form of government neglect.
<p>
<b>Black Families and Adoption</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is some evidence that blacks adopt at a much higher rate than whites if one controls for family structure, income, and age of parents.<sup>77</sup>  A 1983 Department of Health and Human Services study78 put these comparable rates at:
<p><ul>
<li>7 adoptions per 10,000 black families for all black families;
<p>
<li>2 adoptions per 10,000 white families for all white families; and
<p>
<li>2 adoptions per 10,000 Hispanic families for all Hispanic families.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Controlling for age of parents (below 55), family income (above poverty level), and family structure (intact families), the rates change to:
<p><ul>
<li>18 adoptions per 10,000 black families within the range;
<p>
<li>4 adoptions per 10,000 white families within the range; and
<p>
<li>3 adoptions per 10,000 Hispanic families within the range.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These figures convey the reality of much higher adoption rates among blacks than among whites or Hispanics for children in public welfare agencies who are available for adoption.<sup>79</sup>  There is, however, conflicting evidence that white women were more likely to make adoption plans than black women.<sup>80</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To meet the needs of all children within their own racial communities by placing them in couple-headed families above poverty, the same study suggests that the response rate among black families would have to be far higher than it is. It would need to approach 44 per 10,000 families for blacks, compared with 6 per 10,000 families for whites and 6 per 10,000 families for Hispanics. This would require an enormous increase in the rates of adoption by blacks and Hispanics. Richard Barth of the School of Social Welfare at the University of California at Berkeley sums up the conclusions to which these data lead:
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The growth of African-American adoptions have increased by 92% in the last 5 years and Hispanic adoptions by 80%. The growth of African American adoptions would have to grow four times faster than that during the next five years in order to give African American children parity of access to adoption. For Hispanic children, the growth rate would have to double for their opportunity to be adopted to reach parity with Caucasian children.<sup>81</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To achieve these levels of adoption will require a great community effort by black and Hispanic people.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As well-run private agencies demonstrate, large pools of adoptive parents can be developed over time. Even pools of parents for "harder to place children" can be developed when the effort is made by a committed organization. For instance, Down's syndrome children are adopted quite quickly because there is a network of screened parents in place and ready to adopt. Similarly, a pool of parents ready to adopt HIV-positive babies has been developed by the National Council for Adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a 1980 study of black parents, sociology professor Robert Hill of the Institute for Urban Research at Morgan State University estimated that three million black households are interested in adopting children. This translates into one hundred black families for every black child in foster care waiting for adoption.<sup>82</sup>  Given this potential, a pool of prescreened adoptive parents big enough to take care of the needs of black children represents an achievable goal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The private sector can best develop this pool because private organizations are motivated to do so. Building pools of parents is not the strong suit of public agencies.<sup>83</sup>  Some private organizations in the black community have achieved remarkable results. Recently, for instance, in just one year, Detroit's Homes for Black Children placed 132 children in black homes -- more than all the other 13 child welfare agencies in the city.<sup>84</sup>  To increase the rate of adoption within black families, the leadership of the black community should commit itself strongly to using private organizations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the emphasis should be on making it easier for black families to adopt, blocking transracial adoptions just because the children are black and the parents are white discriminates against many needy black children because of race. Moreover, it does not increase the rate of in-race adoption. California, despite a law requiring a 90-day search for a same-race family before a child can be adopted across racial lines, still has twice as many black children as white children waiting for adoption, often for long periods.<sup>85</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Institute for Justice last year filed suit on behalf of a white foster couple who had cared for a black child since birth. When the child became eligible, they sought to adopt him but were blocked by the public welfare agency because they were not black. Even when black parents were not found, the agency persisted in blocking this adoption. No one can argue that this was in the best interest of the child.<sup>86</sup>  Similar racial discrimination prevented the adoption of a white child by a black couple who had fostered the child since birth. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1984, liberal black columnist Carl T. Rowan argued against the "abominable notion that race must be the dominant factor in deciding who can deliver loving care and protection to a child."  Rowan equated the position of black social workers who support only in-race adoption with a 1954 statement by a segregationist Mississippi editor that "every child has the right to be educated among children and by teachers of the same racial background."<sup>87</sup>  Furthermore, according to professor Rita Simon, sociologist at the American University and expert in transracial adoption, "The data in our studies and indeed in all the studies that have been done show that transracial adoptions serve the children's best interests."<sup>88</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Still, opposition to transracial adoption is strong. When former Senator Howard Metzenbaum (D-OH) steered S. 1224 through Congress in 1993, he did so to outlaw obstacles similar to the above restrictions that exist in most states. But the Clinton Administration, which supports race matching, succeeded in changing the legislation so that lack of race matching could be used to deny or delay a placement.<sup>89</sup>  Instead of encouraging solutions, such as private adoption agencies that specialize in placing black children, the Administration's policy aggravates the problem.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Bunning Amendment, incorporated into the House-passed welfare bill, repeals the Clinton policy. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) had a similar amendment (S. 637) to the Senate version of the welfare reform bill. The Children's Defense Fund supported the Clinton Administration's approach,<sup>90</sup> despite the evidence of researchers such as Rita Simon, who shows that transracial adoption does not damage the child emotionally or developmentally and that transracially adopted children do just as well as those adopted by parents of their own race.<sup>91</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Race matching can be achieved easily if there are enough prescreened adoptive parents. The difficulty lies not in the lack of parents but in the poor track record of public agencies in building a pool of black adoptive parents.
<p>
<b>THE NEED FOR FEDERAL LEADERSHIP</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A child's needs are best served, and his potential fostered most effectively, by the love and sense of belonging provided by a stable family environment. As in other areas of social concern, however, the government's ability to increase love and dedication is limited. This competence resides primarily with the family, the church, and the school. However, through their power to enact wiser laws and provide leadership, lawmakers at the federal level can affect the rate of adoption. They can expound upon its benefits for the child, for the mother who gave birth, and for the parents who adopt.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Adoption is one of those rare good solutions to many thorny problems. Political leaders should help the country realize that it is one of the most effective ways to alleviate the problems arising from illegitimacy, child abuse, and neglect.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lawmakers also must challenge the leaders of other major institutions, especially church leaders, to talk about the goodness of adoption. Educational leaders, particularly in social studies areas, ought to be challenged to develop good materials on adoption. Health insurance leaders ought to be challenged as well, for adoption is a less costly solution to infertility than is fertility treatment, which averages about $35,000 per course of treatment. Media leaders ought to harness their expertise in communications to promote adoption to the nation at large, instead of attacking it.<sup>92</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The more this is done, the more attractive adoption will be to growing numbers of families. America also needs to celebrate parents who adopt and parents who care for foster children -- especially those who both foster <I>and</I> adopt. They show a double generosity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption is a national resource that should be encouraged and expanded by government where possible. The federal government should undertake a public relations campaign, targeted to girls under the age of 18 who have conceived out of wedlock, on the benefits of adoption. In addition, Congress should:
<P>
<b>1)  Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 for non-recurring adoption expenses.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress permits a tax deduction for the medical costs of fertility treatment (typically between $35,000 and $50,000 for testing, test tube conception, and deep freeze, development, and discard). The average revenue loss for such treatment is about $8,000. Some corporate health plans, the costs of which are fully excludable from employees' taxable income, also cover fertility treatment. By contrast, the Treasury would gain financially from a one-time $5,000 tax credit that encouraged parents to assume the total cost of caring for foster children -- each of whom now costs taxpayers over $13,000 each year.<sup>93</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This tax credit should be fully refundable (including against Social Security taxes) so that poorer parents who adopt a child receive the same level of support as those who earn more and have larger tax liabilities. The object is to encourage and support those who want to adopt. Being less generous with poorer parents (and more black parents are poor compared to white parents) is unwise because it reduces the incentive to adopt.
<p>
<b>2)  Hold hearings on the Clinton Administration's blocking of an effective drug testing and treatment program for cocaine-addicted pregnant mothers. If necessary, pass legislation to reverse the Administration's action.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The high incidence of serious child abuse among drug-addicted mothers inflicts pain and damage on cocaine-addicted babies. With some 350,000 children affected each year, there is an obvious need for a change in federal law to permit the testing of mothers suspected of cocaine addiction. These babies are at high risk for foster care and for severe damage to their health and development.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

South Carolina Attorney General Charles Molony Condon ran a successful program of testing, mandated treatment, or a jail sentence if the mother refused treatment. The result was dramatic: the incidence of cocaine-addicted mothers fell from 24 per month in Charleston to five or six per month.<sup>94</sup>  The Clinton Administration, however, called the program punitive and racially discriminatory and threatened to cut off all federal reimbursements to the hospital involved, effectively threatening to shut down the program and discouraging other states interested in replicating the Charleston model.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress should take steps to reverse this Administration policy. The use of cocaine by pregnant women is a major factor in the death or severe damaging of many thousands of cocaine-affected newborns.
<p>
<b>3) Issue annual report cards on the rate of adoption in each state.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To redress the poor quality of national data on adoption and foster care, Congress should instruct the Department of Health and Human Services to issue comparative report cards on the performance of each state in a number of areas concerning the family condition of children, including:
<p><ul>
<li>The number and rate of out-of-wedlock births,
<P>
<li>The rate of adoption,
<p>
<li>The length of stay in foster care, including information on the longest stays,
<p>
<li>The typical period between the availability of a child for adoption and the child's adoption, and
<p>
<li>The typical period between the beginning of foster care and the agency's finalization of a placement plan (decision regarding the future of the child).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dissemination of such information will keep state residents better informed and help encourage agencies to find children good, permanent homes.
<p>
<b>4)  Require hospitals and clinics receiving federal funds for family planning services to provide clear and accurate information on the benefits of adoption to all out-of-wedlock teenage mothers.
</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress should require HHS to contract with pro-adoption experts for the writing and distribution of an appropriate brochure on the benefits of adoption for both mother and child. Congress then should require that this brochure be distributed in all hospitals which receive federal funding, either directly or indirectly, and in all federally funded family planning clinics, and that the staff of such hospitals and clinics draw attention to this material.
<p>
<b>5)  Make it easy for all churches, particularly black churches that serve the poor, to affiliate with adoption agencies and become involved in the adoption process as outreach to prospective adopting parents.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the best ways the federal government can help these churches is by providing an incentive for members to adopt more children waiting in foster care. The full refundability of the $5,000 tax credit will do much to effect this. Unless their members are able to pay most of the normal costs of adoption, there is little likelihood that black churches in poor neighborhoods will be involved. With the tax credit and with church involvement, however, the probability of an increase in adoption is significantly greater.
<P>
<b>6)  Ensure the civil rights of all children in foster care and modify the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to prohibit clearly the use or consideration of race or ethnicity in denying or delaying the placement of a child for foster care or adoption.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The fundamental principle behind all civil rights is equality of rights and equal treatment under law. A young child without a family cries out for as quick a placing as possible within a caring family, so that his long-term human potential may not be thwarted at critical early stages of development. The "personness" of that child is infinitely more important than his or her "blackness," "Indianness," "Hispanicness," or "Asianness."  In cases where parents of similar ethnic background are unavailable within, say, a 90-day period, then those who are available and willing to adopt should be united with the child, both for the child's benefit and for the good of society.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Those who are anxious to have the children of a community adopted within that community must ensure a sufficient supply of parents wanting to adopt. The onus is on the community and ought not to be placed on the waiting child. To help assure a pool of parents, Congress should work with states to streamline and simplify adoption procedures in minority communities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many opportunities for developing a pool of waiting parents are available. The network of minority churches is extensive. By linking with private adoption agencies, these churches can help respond to the needs of minority children awaiting adoption. Many other ethnic organizations can be harnessed to bring the pool of minority adopting parents up to the level needed. The press could carry public service announce-ments in minority communities. Minority fraternities and sororities also could play an important role. These and similar community efforts would raise public consciousness about adoption.
<p>
<b>7)  Change the Indian Child Welfare Act to curtail the reach of Indian Nation law over those who have emigrated from those communities and societies.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While fully respecting the right of Indian nations to regulate adoptions within their territories, and while fully respecting the rights of all Indian parents giving up their children for adoption to request that the Indian nations take these children for adoption, Congress ought to change civil rights law so that the rights of Indian or part-Indian parents living outside the nations' territories are upheld.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Under current law, a child with as little as one sixty-fourth Indian ancestry may be under the control of that Indian tribe for adoption, no matter where the child lives. While the number may be modest, the principle of "personness" again is paramount. Just as a foreign-born American citizen is not subject to the adoption laws of his country of origin, an Indian who has chosen freely to leave the Indian nation and to marry someone outside it should no longer be subject to its laws. H.R. 3286 addresses this issue well.
<p>
<b>8)  Reject the language in the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This charter could preclude adoptions for millions of children over time and deny U.S. couples the option of adopting foreign children. The unsigned U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child may come before Congress in the near future for ratification. In the current draft, international adoption is declared to be a last option, after the home country has exhausted its search.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As in cases of transracial and race-matching adoption, each nation has a responsibility to assemble a pool of prescreened adoptive parents if it has children waiting to be adopted. If a nation does not have such a pool, and yet blocks couples from abroad from adopting, that nation is neglecting its children. The United States should be on the side of the child rather than on the side of governments that seek international acceptance of some specious "right" to neglect their nation's children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the language of the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child is accepted by Congress, it could mean an end to most international adoptions. The Hague Convention, to which the United States is a signatory, and which guides present policies, is superior though far from sufficient. Its guiding principle is that care in a family is better for a child than care in an institution.
<p>
<b>WHAT THE STATES SHOULD DO</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Because regulating adoption is a state function, most of the practical reforms must be enacted by state legislatures. And because of the particular need to address the transracial adoption issue in a just and caring fashion, the states must take special care to eliminate discrimination against black adoptive parents and black children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To increase the pool of available parents to fill the needs of all children, states should encourage the privatization of adoption. Specialized agencies can work constructively with those sections of the community that are willing to serve the many different needs of children: black children, older children, children with special medical problems, and children with other emotional or developmental difficulties. As different groups already have demonstrated, it is possible to line up a pool of screened and qualified parents more than willing to adopt children with even the most difficult needs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One effort, started by Fr. George Clements in Chicago in the mid-1980s, had each church set about achieving the adoption of one child within the congregation.95  Though initially the program received wide publicity and had some impact, it has not become a sustained and organized national effort. However, in Florida, One Church, One Child of Florida has developed a successful partnership between church and state. Between March 1988 and September 1990, this organization placed 805 black children in adoption.<sup>96</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Phoebe Dawson, a social worker who heads New Beginnings, a licensed nonprofit adoption agency in Columbus, Georgia, has been very successful in this work. For instance, an agency in Cleveland, Ohio, was not able to find minority parents for a young minority child, leaving the child at serious risk of a protracted wait for adoption. One worker at the agency contacted New Beginnings, which was able to resolve the problem quickly because of its close ties to black Baptist churches across the country.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To encourage adoption, states should:
<p>
<b>1)   Privatize adoption services.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Private adoption services are more efficient and more effective than state agencies where adoption is concerned, as illustrated by the track record of Detroit's Homes for Black Children. They are accountable to a board of directors, while state agencies are not. Private organizations may be sued, which increases their accountability to the children and parents they serve. By contrast, state agencies often cannot be sued. Furthermore, people are more inclined to donate money, time, services, and goods to a private adoption agency than to pay taxes for government agencies.
<p>
<b>2)  Change the way public welfare agencies are financed. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Public welfare agencies dealing with children receive more money to keep children in foster care than they do to clear them for adoption. States should make the allocation of Title IVE monies to these agencies contingent on their record in making final determinations on the future status of children within 12 months of entering foster care. Those not returning to their families must be adopted within three months or handed over to a private agency for adoption.
<p>
<b>3)  Establish separate units at the county level to assist the courts in making speedy and appropriate judgments. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These units should make the initial decision whether to terminate the rights of the parent and bring the process to court or return the child to his family. All babies under 12 months of age coming into the protective custody of a public welfare agency should be processed through the termination unit as a matter of course. A great many such children should be placed for adoption quickly. This in turn would prevent the buildup of a large number of children in foster care -- children who grow more and more difficult to place with each passing year, as the significant drop in the percentage of older children who get adopted clearly indicates.
<p>
<b>4)  Maintain special Medicaid coverage for all special-needs adopted children. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This makes it possible for many middle and low-income families to adopt a sick child they would not be able to care for without Medicaid support. It makes sense for government to provide this support, for the special-needs child in foster care will cost the government even more.
<p>
<b>5)  Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While working to increase the pool of minority parents and to enhance the flow of prequalified and ready-to-adopt minority parents, states should continue the practice of transracial adoption when no same-race parents are available. When the child becomes ready for adoption, his need is immediate and acute. Minority community groups can monitor the pool of prescreened, qualified minority parents for all the relevant categories of children: older children, older male children, sibling groups of children, medically needy children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition to the issues involved in ending discrimination against black children waiting to be adopted and against black couples waiting to adopt, there is much else to be done by the states.
<p>
<b>6)  Use leadership opportunities to encourage adoption.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Governors and state legislatures should consider mounting campaigns to increase interest in adoption. With the prompting and advocacy of the Institute for Children in Cambridge Massachusetts, the State of Massachusetts, under Governor William Weld's direction, embarked upon Assignment Adoption, a series of government reforms to reduce the number of children in foster care and to increase the practice of adoption.
<p>
<b>7)  Establish separate units for termination of the parental rights of convicted abusing parents.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When the difficult duty of assessing the appropriateness of terminating parental rights is commingled with the mandate to preserve the family at all costs, the good of the abused child suffers. The long-term good of the child is helped by establishing separate units of social workers who help the court reach clear and speedy decisions regarding the parents' right to continue as parents. These workers can help the courts without the conflict of interest that is present when they also try therapeutically to help the family come together or stay together. It is best that such work be carried on by a different set of professionals. The best interests of the child remain paramount while the effort to help the parent is vigorously pursued.
<p>
<b>8)  Enact a strict 12-month timeline for adjudication of the long-term parental status of every child in foster care.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A University of Chicago study finds that children who enter foster care as infants remain in the system 22 percent longer than other young children.<sup>97</sup>  Within a 12-month period, the court and the termination unit should decide whether a child should be returned to his parents or placed for adoption. Continuance in foster care beyond that time must be regarded by all as a failure to provide properly for the needs of the child. To be lax or negligent in this matter is to be guilty of serious child neglect.
<p>
<b>9)  Centralize the collection of state data on all formal adoptions and foster care actions.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In order to facilitate the practice of adoption and the reduction of foster care lengths of stay to the minimum time needed, the collection of accurate data is critical. At present it is poor and varies greatly in quality between states. National leaders, national and state campaigns to encourage adoptions, and the stimulation of executive action to initiate and maintain reforms all require an accurate picture of what is happening to children in adoption and foster care. The state Office of Vital Statistics or its equivalent ought to be the repository of all adoption information, and the state Office of Human Services or its equivalent ought to be the repository of all foster care data.
<p>
<b>10) Enact legislation requiring of public social service agencies the same licensing standards and requirements as those now imposed on private adoption agencies.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Just as Congress has passed a law (H.R. 1 and S. 2) to subject itself to the same regulations it imposes on the rest of the country, all state agencies involved in adoptions ought to be subject to the same reporting and regulatory oversight as adoption agencies are. This reform will likely have the speedy effect of reducing these regulations to the bare minimum needed for the good of the child.
<P>
<b>11) Mandate drug testing of pregnant mothers suspected of drug abuse, particularly cocaine abuse.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of the high incidence of serious child abuse among drug-addicted mothers, because of the pain and damage done to cocaine-addicted babies, and because this condition now affects 350,000 children a year, states should push for a federal law permitting the drug testing of mothers suspected of cocaine addiction so that hospitals may participate in such programs without being threatened with a cutoff of federal funds as happened in the South Carolina case discussed above.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Children born to drug-addicted mothers are at risk for a host of difficulties and abuses: lower birth weight, physical abuse, and not getting the affectionate nurturing critical for early attachment formation and its concomitant long-range benefits, among them the formation of a solid conscience and the ability to relate well with others. Given these risks to the child, the requirement of drug testing when cocaine or crack cocaine ingestion is suspected is an appropriate protection.
<p>
<b>12) Prohibit the removal of a child who is eligible for adoption from foster parents who are willing to adopt the child, except when the child is being returned to the legal parents. Enact legislation to permit foster parents to initiate adoption proceedings.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the parents are deemed by the agency as suitable for fostering the child, they should qualify automatically as suitable for adopting the child. Today, many foster parents are willing to adopt the children they have fostered once they become available for adoption. However, mainly because of the effective prohibition of transracial adoptions, these parents frequently are denied the chance to adopt the children who have become attached to them. These couples should have the right to adopt the child once the courts have decided he may be adopted. If child welfare agencies have not made this possible within six months of the court decision, foster parents ought to be granted the standing in law to sue the adoption agency and initiate adoption proceedings.
<P>
<b>13) Enact laws requiring child welfare agencies to initiate adoption proceedings for any child who has been abandoned by his parents for six months.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This rule should apply for any child in out-of-home care for six months whose parent has not engaged in meaningful interaction with the child during that period. Due process in the courts will protect the rights of parents barred from contact with their children due to very unusual circumstances. However, a child left alone for six months is a child without a dedicated parent.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

More and more of the nation's children are at risk of child abuse and neglect as rates of illegitimacy rise. Their plight merits the generous response of dedicated people. Few responses can match the depth and devotion entailed in adopting a child. This dedication reduces a host of problems for the nation: the costs of extended foster care, the poorer health and slower development of children in foster care or in the home of neglectful and abusing parents, and the higher incidence of addiction, crime, and dependency.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Adoption increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money for the taxpayer. It brings much happiness to the adopting parents. It is good for all involved.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Adoption works.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By vetoing the adoption legislation passed last year, President Clinton defeated the most significant reform in the practice of adoption to be seen in decades. Sharply rising out-of-wedlock births add to the long-range costs of welfare, because being born out of wedlock significantly increases the chances of ending up on welfare. As this pool of needy children grows, all too often, up to two million couples waiting to adopt are frustrated in their efforts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The need is great and the solution is obvious: adoption. Yet government agencies and practices actively discourage this solution which, unlike present policies, could help solve a major national problem while also reducing both welfare dependency and long-range costs. The situation cries out for reform. The suffering of the children cries out for reform.

An Attributional Analysis," <I>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</I>, Vol.  48, No.  4 (1985), pp.  1054-1066.  An interesting anomaly has emerged from an analysis of adoption studies.  Clinical studies traditionally have shown adopted adolescents to be overrepresented in psychiatric settings.  The same occurred here, but these adolescents were found not to have emotional or psychological problems at these rates.  Adopted adults are less likely to receive treatment than the general population.  This seeming contradiction occurs because adoptive parents are more likely to refer their adopted children for possible treatment.  Of all adopted children referred by parents for clinical treatment, only 27 percent had a clinical diagnosis.  The remainder -- almost 75 percent -- received counseling for normal adolescent issues.<p>

The fact that the exit numbers of minority children are smaller than those of white children will result in additional increases in the proportion of minority children in care.  If current trends continue, minority children will become the clear majority in the nation's substitute care population in the next few years.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> reported recently that Congress has identified more than 750 education programs in various departments and agencies of the federal government.<sup>2</sup>  One program -- the largest and most ambitious in the federal arsenal -- is Title I, Education for the Disadvantaged (formerly Chapter One), which provides funding for local education agencies and schools in areas with high rates of poverty in order to provide additional educational assistance to low-achieving students.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Title I was an invention of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. Enacted in 1965 with great fanfare, it was designed to reach poor children across the board from all geographic regions, of all races and ethnic groups, in all school settings: public, private non-sectarian, and private religious schools. The terms of its enactment were so unusual that they bear re-examination.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Until Johnson's elevation to the Presidency in 1963, no President had even attempted a major federal education program for elementary schools. Americans were skeptical of, even hostile to, the idea of federal encroachment on education. Local control was a tradition as old and as venerable as the Republic, and citizens of both parties and all regions guarded their prerogative jealously. While President Dwight Eisenhower had adopted a number of education programs in response to Sputnik, reflecting a tradition one and one-half centuries old, the nation as a whole was reluctant to support general programs of federal aid to elementary and secondary schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to the robust and long-standing commitment to local control, another factor was at work: If there were federal aid available, would it be for all children, without regard to whether they attended public or non-public school, or would it be restricted to public schools only?  Not to put too fine a point on it, the question was whether poor children in Catholic schools would receive aid on an equal footing with children in public schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is not an academic point. Indeed, the whole fate of the federal role in education hinged on this issue alone. The decision of the Congress in 1965, at the urging of the President, was that all eligible children should receive federal support regardless of whether they attended public or private school. Interestingly, this issue was raised by, and the decisive votes cast by, big-city Democrats. Indeed, they withheld their votes subject to meeting the condition that all poor children must be eligible, not just public school children. This was an historic and honorable compromise. Federal aid to public schools would not have become a reality without it. In this case, at least, the public schools' best friends were private schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Let me provide some sense of scale. Between 1966 and 1995, the federal government spent nearly $100 billion on education aid to the disadvantaged, of which the vast majority was for Title I; about three percent of that money made its way to the support of private school students, the fact that they make up about 12 percent of total enrollment notwithstanding. Even though private school support had led to enactment of Title I, public school officials across the nation were slow to include private schools in Title I programs; yet Title I represented the greatest single windfall for public schools in their history. It is important to re-emphasize this little-noted fact: The windfall was thanks to, and at the expense of, private schools. But public school officials had short memories and a weakly developed sense of obligation to their counterparts in private schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even though the public schools had been slow to respond, respond they finally did; and the relationship that emerged, if not cordial, was correct. In spite of significant bureaucratic hurdles, Title I funds for private school children flowed -- not in amounts as large as might have been expected, but the program, limited though it was, worked.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Twenty-five years later, the portion of Title I that supported private school children was virtually destroyed, first by action of the U.S. Supreme Court in <I>Aguilar v. Felton</I> (1985), then by congressional inaction. Public school officials never raised their voices to support private education. The Court struck down 25 years of a relatively successful program through which private school students received limited services. The Court ruled that the existing educational practices by which Title I funds were delivered to non-public schools created "excessive entanglement between church and state," thus violating the constitutional ban against public support for religion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, the number of private school children served by Title I has fallen significantly, and the cost of services to them has risen dramatically. The reason?  The extraordinary lengths to which the <I>Aguilar</I> decision has driven even well-intentioned school districts. New York City, for example, with the largest Title I program in the country, has been using Title I buses (something like bookmobiles of old) to bring Title I services to eligible private school students. No longer permitted (by <I>Aguilar</I>) to send public school teachers into Catholic and other religious schools, the buses pull up at the curb (which is public space), and the children leave their school as they set foot in this mobile classroom.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to buses, Title I "infrastructure" for non-public school students includes computers that are programmed to work only with Title I programs in them. Imagine: a computer with a "v" chip that prohibits children in religious schools from studying anything except secular subjects!
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If it were not true, it would be funny. New York City reports that $16 million of its Title I funds will go for infrastructure, not instruction. It is a Kafkaesque solution to a problem created by a Supreme Court clearly unable to make sense out of its own history of tortured interpretations of the constitutional requirement that church and state be separated. In striking down the practices that led to the <I>Aguilar</I> decision, the Court put the ball back in Congress's hands -- not implicitly, as all decisions do, but explicitly and deliberately.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Supreme Court invited Congress to fashion a constitutionally defensible method of funding children who attend non-public schools. In particular, Mr. Justice Powell, writing in his concurring opinion in <I>Aguilar</I>, makes the point that if Congress could develop a strategy for helping children in denominational schools --without using public schools -- the Court would be likely to accept it. Congress could create, for example, a Title I voucher system, an approach that would survive judicial scrutiny.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That the Congress did not respond to this invitation is public knowledge. The reason for it is not. The public schools -- which had been the principal beneficiaries of Title I over the years -- refused to come to the aid of their private school compatriots, whose initial support had permitted the program to come into existence in the beginning.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is time for the worm to turn.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is now widely recognized that there are two major problems with Title I. The first, and in some respects the most formidable, is that the program does not produce what researchers call "sustaining effects."  Put most bluntly, Title I does not appear to make a difference in the lives of children. While the program appears to do no harm -- the first test for any helping service, as all physicians know -- it is not clear that it does much good. Or, if it does do much good, it is not clear for whom and in what circumstances. The fact that Title I does not do what it was intended to do -- significantly improve the academic performance of low-income and low-achieving students -- means that the current program configuration can no longer be seriously defended.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ironically, there is a growing body of evidence about what does make a difference in the education of poor children: Researchers and practitioners alike know that a school with a shared culture and a shared commitment to academic excellence makes a difference. They know that expectations make a difference. They know that high standards make a difference. They know that a safe and orderly learning environment makes a difference. Most important, it is clear that religiously affiliated schools share all these characteristics. The work of the late Professor James Coleman of the University of Chicago, perhaps the nation's most important research sociologist, makes the point unequivocally: Poor youngsters -- particularly poor black youngsters -- do better in parochial school than in public school.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Critics assert that Coleman's work is flawed. No doubt it is in some small ways, but the overall findings have not been challenged. Indeed, in any other field -- housing, health, transportation, the environment -- findings as robust as Professor Coleman's would form the basis of new policy, as they should for Title I. Originally launched as a demonstration, fueled as much by hope as by fact, Title I should continue to be the source of flexibility and innovation, not a program cast in the bureaucratic concrete of the Great Society. Indeed, both the spirit of Title I and research of the kind produced by James Coleman present Congress with the opportunity -- in fact, the obligation -- to make significant program changes. I will return to those later.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The second problem is that schools across the country -- but most notably in New York -- are at their wits end with <I>Aguilar</I> compliance. It is so clumsy and bureaucratic -- and so obviously so -- that not even these giant bureaucracies can tolerate it any longer. As a consequence, they are seeking relief. New York is going to Court to get <I>Aguilar</I> overturned. According to <I>Education Week</I>, Secretary Riley supports New York City.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In this connection they have some reason to be optimistic. The United States Supreme Court has changed since <I>Aguilar</I> and now appears ready to change its decision. Five justices have expressed an interest in doing so. (As Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, reminds us in his wonderful article "What Do You Do When the Supreme Court Is Wrong?"  you wait, as the Court's "most enduring practice is to reverse itself.")
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In an energetic and robust democratic republic, however, the possibility, even the probability, of the Supreme Court reversing itself should offer only scant comfort. In particular, Congress has within its power the opportunity and the capacity to do the right thing on its own, in which case the Court can simply ratify the action at some later date. More to the point, the Court is a blunt instrument, and Congress can legislate with surgical precision.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To be precise, the Supreme Court will not institute aid to individuals, but Congress can. The best that could be expected from the Court, with no new statute to interpret, in reversing <I>Aguilar</I> is a return to the <I>status quo ante bellum</i>. That is not good enough. It is time to return to first principles. Indeed, the only intellectually defensible federal role in education is one in which Uncle Sam supports all Americans equally. The U.S. Congress has no more interest in a narrow program of support for public schools <I>qua</I> public schools than it would have in a program detrimental to public schools. The congressional test should be neutrality and equal treatment of equals, just as the original Title I legislation was based on the conviction that all poor children -- no matter whether they attend government or private school -- should be beneficiaries of federal largesse.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That is the principle of the famous GI Bill for higher education; it should be no less a principle in lower education. Indeed, in a little-known footnote to the GI Bill, servicemen and women were eligible to use their GI Bill benefits to complete high school, and some significant number did just that.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The guiding principle for Title I reform, then, should be reconnecting the Title I program to its true beneficiaries -- students, not schools. As it is, Title I now commits more than $1,000 to each eligible child; if that money were available as a Title I voucher, it would permit children to select schools that best serve their needs, whether public, private non-sectarian, or private religious. Now, $1,000 a child may not sound like much in the public sector, particularly in cities like Washington, D.C., where per pupil expenditures are about $10,000 a year in public school, but the facts of the private school world are quite different.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
True, the First Child's private school, Sidwell Friends Academy, costs well over $10,000 a year, but that is the exception, not the rule, in the world of private schools. Nationally, there are about 28,000 private schools, and they are, on average, low-cost institutions. For example, in 1990, average tuition in Catholic secondary schools was $2,878 per year, and average tuition in Catholic elementary schools was $1,243; average tuition in non-Catholic private secondary schools was $4,395, and in private elementary schools, it was $1,780. In the private school world, $1,000 is a lot of money. (By way of contrast, average per pupil expenditures in public schools in 1990 were $6,472 in secondary schools and $5,177 in elementary schools.)
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A number of communities across the country are trying vouchers or voucher-like mechanisms to see if they will make a difference in the lives of children. The two most notable examples are Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Cleveland, Ohio; in those communities -- in any community anywhere in the nation -- flexible Title I funding (letting dollars follow children) could make an enormous difference. In this connection, beware the critics; unhappily, in schools as in other parts of public life, self-interest is paramount. At a minimum, even the most ardent member of a special-interest group should be pressed hard as to why Congress should not at least permit states and localities to use their Title I funds as vouchers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Members of Congress should keep two crucial points in mind.
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>First</b>, no program could be more appropriate to the pedagogical needs of today; public schools in our big cities have become bureaucratic nightmares, often frightening places to teach in or attend. Teachers are as much losers in this equation as students. Title I vouchers would free the teacher as they free the student. At issue is not competition for Title I vouchers (though there would be some, and it would be welcome). One thousand dollars a child will not unleash massive competitive pressures. What it will do is permit families to choose schools that are consistent with their values. And it will permit teachers, who ultimately manage these resources, to do so with more professional autonomy and flexibility.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Second</b>, it is by now universally recognized that the nation faces a moral as well as a public school crisis. Not surprisingly, the two issues are intertwined inextricably. They cannot be separated. From the time of the ancient Greeks to the present, thoughtful men and women have known that the single most important purpose of schooling is character formation, to turn boys and girls into men and women who know right from wrong, good from bad. Successful schools impart the values of democratic capitalism -- honesty, self-respect, respect for others, tolerance, enterprise, diligence, moderation, forbearance, courage. It is precisely to these issues that religious schools are most committed.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most recent report of the Public Agenda Foundation indicates that Americans across the board prefer private to public schools; families with the resources have long acted on this. Witness the First Child. Witness the behavior of Members of Congress, of whom about one-third use private schools. Witness the behavior of public school teachers. Of those with the means (twice the median family income), as many as half -- in big cities -- enroll their children in private schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The effect of <I>Aguilar</I> has been to actively discourage poor children from attending non-government schools by penalizing them if they do. The price of <I>Aguilar</I> is to lose benefits or to make it so awkward to claim them that it is hardly worth the candle. It is a bizarre commentary on modern times that a nation founded on a fundamental commitment to religious freedom would produce policies actively hostile to religion. More bizarre yet is that the burden should fall most heavily on the poor.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This Congress has before it an historic opportunity to convert Title I into a voucher program. Let poor families -- not bureaucrats -- decide where their children will go to school: government or non-government, secular or non-secular, as the case may be.

<h3>LIBERATING PEOPLE FOR SELF-GOVERNMENT	</h3>
<b>By Stephen Goldsmith</b>
<P> Stephen Goldsmith is the mayor of Indianapolis, Indiana.  He spoke at <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>'s Resource Bank Annual Meeting in Chicago, Illinois, on April 25, 1996.

<p>
Let me begin by stating the obvious: We do not have enough wealth in this country, or in the state of Indiana or the city of Indianapolis, to redistribute it fast enough to buy our way out of poverty. This is true for a couple of reasons: because there is not enough wealth and because it is a self-contradictory process. 
<p>

Indianapolis is the 12th largest city in the country, and we have the same problems as the other top 25. If we do what the mayors of the other large cities have done, particularly east of the Mississippi, we get elected and raise property taxes so we can do more good deeds for the people who are in our communities. But when we raise property taxes, people figure out that since wealth is mobile, they can pick up their business, pick up their home, and move to the other side of the city line. When anyone moves to the other side of the city line, by definition the city is a little less wealthy, just because one wealthy guy got up and left. So we have to raise taxes a little bit more to make up for the guy who left, and then raise taxes a little bit more, and so on.
<p>

As reflected in an interesting study done a couple of years ago by the Federal Reserve Bank in Philadelphia, there is a supply side curve in property taxation, in addition to enormous out-migrations of wealth and populations from urban centers, in part because of the policy decisions made by mayors, and, to some extent, governors. In a global economy this problem is even more pronounced because firms do not have to stay in Washington, D.C., or Chicago, and you don't have to manufacture on this side of the ocean. You have a number of other choices about where to invest, and this mobility means we have to think about our issues somewhat differently.
<p>

My office is on the twenty-fifth floor of the City-County Building in Indianapolis. On a clear day, I can look out my window and see the dollar bills float across the city line and land on the other side where the schools are better, the crime is less, the property taxes are lower, and the dollars find a more hospitable place to land. This is a concept that you can repeat in any large city in the country. That is one dynamic. Another important dynamic is that top-down, autocratic, control-driven systems do not work. 
<p>


<b>Creating Systems That Don't Work</b><p>


Ever since the 1930s, government has been very interested in control mechanisms: how to control purchasing, how to control hiring, how to control everything. But no matter how much good we want to do through government, we are creating systems that cannot do so. These big rule-driven systems insure that we do not have enough discretion in the way we deliver public services to tailor those services to the needs of a highly diverse population. If we take a situation in which wealth is mobile and add to it this dynamic that big systems do not work very well, we begin to get a sense of the problem.
<p>

Let me give you a story about big systems and competition to illustrate this. In Indianapolis, we have a severe labor shortage and tens of thousands of people on welfare simultaneously. This is perverse, to say the least. So I invited America Works to come to Indianapolis. America Works is a for-profit organization, and we pay them a performance fee when they take someone off of welfare and that person has a job for six months or more. Inviting them to Indianapolis was controversial because even there, there is a feeling among social service providers that you cannot both make a profit and do a good deed -- a particularly socialist view of life.
<p>

About 45 days after America Works came to Indianapolis I asked them how they were doing, because I had a lot of political capital involved in this experiment. They said, "Not very well."  I said, "Why not?  Can't you train anybody to secure a job?"  And they said, "That's not the problem. We have lots and lots of employers who want the employees. We can't get the welfare department to refer anybody to us."
<p>

So I decided to visit the welfare department. Each week I do a different city job. I've done this for a long time; it's a good way to learn what goes on. Welfare is run out of the state. So I called the state and said, "I want to go to the welfare department."  The state director of welfare said, "You're not welcome."  I responded, "The police department still works for me and I'm going." 
<p>

So I went to the welfare department, stood behind the desk, and watched state employees administer the system. They were not slovenly; they were not lazy. They were doing their job, which was to verify eligibility and hand out a check. They had a little check sheet that said, "Have you looked for a job?"
<p>

But there was nothing in their job description that connected their performance rating to whether welfare recipients found jobs. There was a total disconnect between the bureaucracy and the values that we claim we are trying to implement. Furthermore, everybody had to be treated the same in this rule-based system. If the applicant's problem was that her husband beat her up, or that her son was a drug addict, or that she could not get a voucher to get to the bus system, or whatever the case might be, the system did not allow enough discretion to solve the problem because it is a "one size fits all" system.
<p>

<b>Competition Creates Value</b><p>
Another key point is that competition creates value. I had a chance-of-a-lifetime opportunity to have breakfast with Milton Friedman about six weeks ago. We talked about schools. I kept saying "public schools," and he kept saying, "They're not public schools. They're government schools, and there's a difference."  I said, "What difference does it make?"  He said, "Here is the difference. You can't have innovation if you don't have markets. And you can't have markets if you don't have customers. And you can't have customers in the ordinary sense in a monopoly. That's a big difference."
<p>

The same is true in every service I deliver in city government. Absent competition, absent customer choice, we cannot create maximum value. Every time we touch a public service and open it up to the marketplace for bidding, we drive up the quality and drive down the price. We can take city employee work groups that have done total quality management for 20 years, ever since it was invented, and say to them, "You're going out of business if you don't bid to keep your jobs," and they will drive down their overhead costs in 60 days.
<p>

Competition always creates efficiencies. We have a wastewater treatment plant in Indianapolis. My City-County Council, who disagree with me on virtually all of these issues, asked me to evaluate the efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant. I agreed. We hired Ernst & Young. They came in and said, "Congratulations, yours is the most efficient wastewater treatment plant in the country. You can save five percent if you really tighten down."  I said, "Let's try this differently. Let's bid it out and see what happens."
<p>

We had five bids from all over the world, most of which were European, because in the United States this is really a government business and there are few private providers. The winning bid reduced our costs by 44 percent or $65 million -- and we already were the most efficient wastewater treatment plant. When government benchmarks itself against other government monopolies, it is meaningless. We need to open up our services to the marketplace.
<p>


<b>Bureaucracy: The Enemy of Devolution</b><p>
I mention these things just to set the stage for my theme, which is that I am an enthusiast for devolution and I think it has no chance of working. I find nothing inconsistent in my position. A state bureaucrat is still a bureaucrat. No matter how well-intentioned bureaucrats may be, and while they may be a little closer to the public, they are still making decisions in place of customers or parents or other individuals who are in need of public goods. I don't think we can create the organizational culture, going back to the welfare department example, that will allow devolution to work.
<p>

Nevertheless, devolution sets in place a chain of events which I hope will allow bold governors and mayors to downsize government. I was a prosecutor for 12 years, have been mayor for five, and yet realize that government is the problem, not the solution.
<p>

Let me talk about where the devolution revolution might take us. Although obviously there is a role for government-produced public goods, generally the marketplace, whenever it can be used, is a much better way to deliver those goods. There has been terrible confusion -- obviously not in this room, because you are the ones responsible for good ideas, but among public officials -- about what is a public good and whether government needs to produce it. We need to address that question.
<p>

For example, I went to HUD two-and-a-half years ago and asked, "Would you do me a favor?  I'd like to give a voucher to every one of the recipients of public housing. Let them pick where they want to live, and if they don't want to live in my public housing units, then I'll tear them down. Let me go out of business."
<p>

As we think about the devolution revolution, the first principle should be to use the marketplace wherever we can. That means either using tax policy instead of grant policy -- tax policy is much more efficient because it appeals to the customers -- or using vouchers. I don't believe that is a very robust part of the current conversation about devolution. Devolution today is taking a federal program, delivering it to the state house and having a state bureaucrat run it as contrasted to asking, "What can we do to help citizens make decisions on their own?"
<p>


<b>Importance of Religion and Mediating Institutions</b><p>
A second point: as we consider these issues, we must underscore the importance of values and religion. If you have not read the Heritage publication on why religion matters, it shows the correlation and/or causation between belief in religion and stable families, belief in religion and rising out of poverty, belief in religion and crime-free environments. It is extremely important.<sup>1</sup>
<p>

Government has a responsibility, if it can do nothing else, to stop supplanting religious institutions and mediating institutions. We should support them. One way is to abolish welfare. Don't abolish helping people, but abolish the government welfare delivery system and deliver necessary services through neighborhood-based and religious-based organizations. If your path to the future is a government check, the check itself is part of the problem.
<p>

Two summers ago, I took the job training money that mayors generally waste and said, "Let's connect kids in tough neighborhoods with a church because a church is virtually always the most important asset in those communities. Let the churches do job training for the summer."  We did it, and it was a great success. At the end of the summer, the state regulator knocked on my door and said, "You've violated the terms of the grant."  I said, "Why?"  He said, "The problem is that you allowed" not required but allowed "the participants in the program to say a prayer before lunch."
<p>

It may seem like a silly example, but the point is that religion matters. Government could at least get out of the way. We continue to try to work through "charter welfare" programs, and we have turned over 20 of our parks to neighborhood churches to maintain. We do everything we can to help inner-city kids connect with religion.
<p>

So we need to understand the role of mediating neighborhood institutions, and particularly religious institutions, in devolution, and they need to be much more visible and much more activist in the public policy arena.

<p>

<b>How to Make a Difference</b><P>
When I got elected, I identified seven neighborhoods, 8,000-20,000 people each, with the greatest problems -- poverty, single-family head of households, and all the rest -- and said, "We're going to try and make a difference. How?  By doing the things I'm supposed to do well and stop doing everything else."
<p>

My fundamental responsibilities as mayor are really to make sure the streets are smooth, the sewers work, and you don't get beat up on your way to work, church, or school. Yet in most urban communities government is not fulfilling its real responsibilities and instead is redistributing wealth and saying that the problem is that we don't have enough social programs.
<p>

In Indianapolis, we have saved $240 million through competing out city services. We have reduced our non-public-safety work force 40 percent, competed out 65 city activities, and created an infrastructure fund of $500 million, without increasing taxes. We have invested our savings in public safety, in streets and sewers and sidewalks, and in cleaning up neighborhood parks. We have tried to help neighborhood leaders take back their parks and their streets. We have tried to make a difference with how we provide our core responsibilities. We see neighborhoods come back together. When the police, the community, and the infrastructure are solid, businesses will invest.
<p>

After I began making these changes in city government, I sent a letter out to every small business in these tough neighborhoods and said, "What is the most important factor that would make you decide to expand or invest in your neighborhood?"  I expected them to say, "The cost of raw materials or the price of my competitor's goods."  But the first two problems with whether they would expand were taxes and regulation. It is interesting that the top two items for the business community in determining whether they would invest in their current sites were government and government. So we began to clear out the regulatory burdens and the other issues they addressed, and sure enough they did in fact invest.
<p>

This approach is inherently populist. Our small-government approach to big-city problems is only fair to those citizens in our community who lack opportunity. When we artificially put a cab cartel together because we don't trust the marketplace to deliver cab services, when we artificially restrict mass transit, when we drive up the price of housing through silly regulations, when we hire middle-class folks that are public bureaucrats to run inferior services in inner-city neighborhoods, all of those things are inherently unfair to the people who need the most help.

<p>

<b>The Ultimate Arrogance</b><p>
The ultimate arrogance is when we tell parents in failing school systems that, because they are poor, their children are banished to poor education. For people like me, who believe that the welfare system is bad for the recipients, not just the taxpayers, the path to the future is a job. And education is essential to getting a good job. It is irresponsible to allow these government-run monopolistic schools to deny parents choices.
<p>

In the City of Indianapolis we have 12 school systems. In the main central school system, there are third grade classes where every child in the class has failed the standardized tests. If you are a poor parent of a second grader in that school, your child will go to that third grade class. The only way out is if you have enough money to move or to send your child to a private school, or if you're fortunate enough to have a voucher that is paid for as the result of the civic concern of a private business.
<p>

Let me give you a couple of statistics about the results of these vouchers, taking children with similar demographics. A second grader in the city public schools is 14 percent behind the state average. A second grader from the inner city enrolled in a Catholic school as a result of a voucher is 9 percent behind the state average. By the time he gets to the eighth grade, the Catholic school child has reached the state average. The public school child is 25 points behind the state average. Every year the child stays in public school, he or she is worse off. Eventually, over 50 percent drop out -- and that's in Indianapolis. We are not good, but there probably are worse examples around the country.
<p>

While fighting the charter school battle and the voucher battle, we had a clarifying event in the Indiana General Assembly last year when the teachers union, which is the most powerful political group in the state of Indiana, came forward and all but said that you can't trust parents to make decisions about where their children should attend school.
<p>

<b>The Fundamental Requirement</b><p>
All of these issues have consistent themes. The Congress of the United States favors public ownership through the tax code. They make me pay police officers more for overtime through the Fair Labor Standards Act. They tell me how much I should pay someone who paints a part of my HUD-owned buildings. They tell me who can work and who cannot work, and a whole range of other things.
<p>

As they push authority down, and as we advocate for devolution, we need to remember that it will not work unless it is just the first step toward a market-based system that recognizes that the way to create true value is to let citizens and taxpayers make decisions that are in their own best interests. There is no better way for our country to allocate public resources and create opportunities.

<a href="fyi111t1.gif">Table</a>: CWC's Impact on Business Widespread
<p> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


By September 14, 1996, the Senate will be voting on ratification of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:S.1732:">Chemical Weapons Convention</a> (CWC), a treaty that would ban the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons. The CWC contains serious shortcomings. It is neither reliably verifiable nor enforceable. As a result, it will not serve the security interests of the United States. But the potential damage from the CWC is not limited merely to national security. It also will impose a costly regulatory burden on American businesses and thus harm America's economy. This burden will result from the CWC's requirement that businesses prove to the U.S. government and international inspectors that they are not producing or stockpiling chemical weapons. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in companies' being fined as much as $50,000 per incident.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

What follows is a state-by-state breakdown of the industrial facilities that are likely to be subject to the requirements of the CWC. These data are provided by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and are based on aggregate data maintained by the federal Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA). Following the data on production facilities is a flow chart provided by the Department of Commerce describing the regulatory process governing the data collection effort.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Estimates of the direct cost that implementing the CWC will impose on U.S. businesses range as high as $200 million annually. The potential indirect costs to businesses, such as those stemming from the loss of confidential information, are difficult to estimate. However, billions of dollars in losses are not out of the question.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is true that the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) supports ratification and implementation of the CWC. Because the CMA is a prominent trade representative in Washington for the chemical industry, its support for the treaty would appear to suggest that the potential regulatory burden is not excessive. But the CMA does not speak for all chemical manufacturers. In fact, more than 60 percent of the facilities most likely to be affected by the CWC are owned by companies not represented by the Association. Further, small businesses, which are less likely to be represented by the CMA, are the ones most likely to be hurt by the increased regulatory burden, because they do not have the money to cover the added costs that will be imposed by the new regulations. Finally, something which the CMA does not emphasize is that chemical companies are not the only ones subject to this treaty. So, too, are food processors, brewers, distillers, pharmaceutical companies, paint companies, petroleum companies, and rubber companies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the Chemical Weapons Convention served the national security interests of the U.S., it would be reasonable to ask American businesses to assume some portion of the burden imposed by the inspection regime. But to ask American businesses to assume the excessive cost burden imposed by implementing a treaty that actually harms U.S. national security makes neither economic nor security sense.

<title> Clinton Takes Undeserved Credit For Congress's Deficit Reduction - Heritage</title>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi113c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Clinton Claims Undeserved Credit for Cutting FY 1996 Deficit<br>
<a href="/heritage/issues96/bud_2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Comparing of Deficit Reduction Plans
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After nearly 18 months of trying to block congressional efforts to enact a seven-year plan to balance the federal budget, President Bill Clinton is now jumping to take credit for the recent news that the FY 1996 deficit will fall to $117 billion -- some $29 billion below the Office of Management and Budget's March estimate and the lowest dollar level since 1981. But not only is the falling deficit none of Clinton's doing; the record shows that he repeatedly blocked Congress's efforts to enact an honest long-term plan to balance the federal budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's claim is especially surprising when one considers that in February 1995, he submitted an FY 1996 budget to Congress that would have raised the deficit to $211 billion, or $94 billion higher than is now expected.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is Congress that deserves taxpayers' credit for cutting Clinton's proposed $211 billion FY 1996 deficit nearly in half. This happened because Congress rejected Clinton's plan and acted to curb spending. According to Congressional Budget Office predictions, the Clinton policies would have perpetuated $200 billion-plus deficits well into the next century. Furthermore, had Clinton not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which included $17 billion in entitlement savings for FY 1996, this year's deficit actually would be less than $100 billion rather than the $117 billion for which Clinton now claims credit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But this has been the White House's pattern throughout the budget battle with Congress: First block congressional initiatives, then claim credit for the good news. Since Clinton sent his budget-busting FY 1996 budget to Capitol Hill, he has proposed seven "balanced budget plans."  Each of these plans -- including Clinton's FY 1997 budget -- proposed higher spending and higher taxes, and as a result, each would have added more to the national debt than the balanced budget plans produced by Congress.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There are a variety of reasons the deficit is now $173 billion lower than its peak of $290 billion in 1992. Clinton policies, however, generally are not among them. Some of the factors:<ul>

<p><li><b>Domestic discretionary cutbacks pushed by Congress.</b> Although Clinton blocked the entitlement reforms embodied in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Congress was able to reverse the growth of discretionary -- or annually appropriated -- spending. Thanks to congressional pressure for program terminations and major cuts, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969.<sup>1</sup>  More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. Many other programs, such as the National Endowment for the Arts, the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the Legal Services Corporation, were cut by more than one-third.

<p><li><b>The turnaround in the savings and loan program.</b> A significant contributor to the soaring deficits under George Bush was the high taxpayer cost of bailing out failed savings and loan institutions. In FY 1991, for example, $66 billion in taxpayer-financed bailout costs was added to the federal deficit. In FY 1992, these costs totaled $2.6 billion. This year, however, this program is expected to bring in over $15 billion in new revenue to the Treasury as assets acquired during the bailout are sold to the private sector. Between FY 1992 and FY 1996, this budgetary reversal (from a program adding to the deficit to one reducing the deficit by generating revenues) amounts to an $18 billion swing in the deficit -- 10 percent of the deficit change between FY 1992 and FY 1996.

<p><li><b>New revenues from selling the electromagnetic spectrum.</b> The White House currently estimates that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction of telecommunications spectrum to private industry will generate over $10 billion in new revenues in FY 1996. These new revenues are considered "offsetting collections."  This means they are subtracted from the expenditures column of the federal register rather than added to the tax revenue column, thus giving the appearance that federal spending is lower than it actually is. In 1992, when the deficit reached its record level, the government did not auction telecommunications spectrum; it simply gave it away at no cost, and therefore at no benefit to the Treasury. Clinton is reaping this windfall.

<p><li><b>Defense cutbacks.</b> The White House now estimates the government will spend roughly $266 billion on national defense in FY 1996 -- $37 billion less than in FY 1992. These cutbacks, initiated by the Bush Administration, reflect the fall of the Soviet Union. Under the Clinton Administration, defense spending has fallen to roughly 3.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and less than 17 percent of overall federal spending. Both levels are lower than at any point since before World War II. By contrast, when the young Bill Clinton had his picture taken with President John F. Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden, defense consumed 50 percent of all federal spending and about 10 percent of the nation's economy.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Combined, the last three items alone account for $65 billion, or 38 percent, of the overall drop in the deficit since 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>A Tax Revenue Windfall.</b> OMB currently projects that tax revenues will total $1.453 trillion in FY 1996, nearly $27 billion higher than was estimated in March. It appears that these new tax collections are a one-time windfall rather than a sign of improved economic conditions. According to OMB, "the Administration believes that most of this increase comes from higher-than-anticipated collections of non-withheld individual income taxes."  In other words, it is possible that this windfall is the result of investors cashing in on capital gains because of the rise in the stock market and the possibility of an agreement between Congress and the White House on a cut in the capital gains tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The rise in tax collections from the doldrums of the Bush recession is a significant factor in the declining deficit. Since 1992, tax revenues have grown by $363 billion, or one-third. During the Bush recession, however, tax revenues grew an average of only 3.8 percent per year, half the average annual growth rate between 1948 and 1996. The combined effect of tax collections returning to their historic year-over-year growth rates and Congress keeping federal spending from growing faster than these new collections has made a significant dent in the deficit picture.
<p>

<b>CLINTON'S RHETORIC VERSUS REALITY<sup>2</sup></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's record throughout the budget debate with Congress stands in stark contrast with his public rhetoric. At every turn during the past 18 months, Clinton stood in the way of smaller government and real long-term deficit reduction. The record is clear:
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #1:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In February 1995, the Clinton Administration responded to the 1994 election results by presenting a status-quo FY 1996 budget to the new Congress. This budget deviated little from "baseline" forecasts which projected $200 billion deficits through the end of the decade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

According to the CBO, the President's February budget would have increased the deficit from an estimated $177 billion in 1995 to $276 billion in 2000. Spending would grow an average of 5 percent per year, some $422 billion in all in just five years. On May 19, 1995, the Senate defeated Clinton's budget plan by a vote of 99 to 0.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #2:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On June 13, 1995, after months of criticizing congressional balanced budget efforts while offering no plan of his own, Clinton presented a second budget plan which he claimed balanced the budget in ten years, by FY 2005. This plan, barely 30 pages in length, fared no better than Clinton's first effort under CBO scrutiny. According to CBO, in addition to not balancing the budget, it would have produced $200 billion deficits for at least the next ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Due to revised economic forecasts, the Administration later said that this plan would balance the budget in nine years. However, the CBO maintained that it would never have balanced the budget. Indeed, CBO found less than $400 billion in legitimate deficit reduction in this Clinton offer -- $350 billion short of the total seven-year deficit reduction in the Balanced Budget Act.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #3:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 7, the day Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, he presented yet a third budget plan. The Administration claimed that this plan also would balance the budget in seven years but was more in line with the President's priorities than the one he had vetoed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Once again, CBO found that the Administration's numbers failed to reach a balanced budget by 2002. While this budget plan proposed larger savings from discretionary spending programs and welfare reform compared to the June budget, it also proposed smaller savings in Medicare and Medicaid. In total, Clinton's third budget produced only $385 billion in credible deficit reduction over seven years -- $365 billion short of the savings achieved by the BBA he had vetoed. Moreover, according to the CBO, instead of balancing the budget in FY 2002 as advertised, it would leave a deficit of $115 billion in that year.
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #4:</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


On December 15, after two weeks of negotiations with congressional leaders, Clinton presented a fourth budget plan. But this plan was mostly an iteration of Budget Plan #3 and contained no new policy recommendations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The CBO scored this plan as still $69 billion out of balance in FY 2002. The Administration tried to make up its shortcomings in reducing the deficit by challenging CBO technical and economic estimates. The Administration had been arguing for weeks that CBO's economic assumptions were too conservative and thus required excessively deep spending cuts to balance the budget. In making this argument, the Administration wanted to have it both ways. While claiming that it wanted to balance the budget, it actually wanted to spend more money as the budget was moving toward balance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 18, 1995, the House defeated this plan by a vote of 412 to 0.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #5:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On January 6, 1996, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan. This plan, largely adapted from a proposal by Senate Democrats, was certified by CBO to balance the budget in seven years, at least on paper. Though it mathematically balances the budget in seven years, however, the fifth Clinton budget fell far short of being a credible plan. The reasons: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Most of the heavy lifting of deficit reduction was required in the two years following the end of Clinton's possible second term as President. Indeed, 62 percent of the plan's $583 billion in deficit reduction falls in FY 2001 and FY 2002. For example, the plan called for $102 billion in Medicare savings over seven years, but 63 percent of these savings were to come in the last two years. Similarly, the plan called for $37 billion in discretionary spending cuts beyond the savings needed to achieve a "hard freeze" in these programs, yet 95 percent of these additional savings fell in the last two years of the plan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While the fifth Clinton budget plan called for $87 billion in gross tax cuts ($17 billion in net tax cuts) over seven years, these cuts were sunsetted in FY 2001 -- one year before the budget was to be balanced. This means taxes would have to be raised. Mathematically, such a ploy "boosts" tax revenues by at least $15 billion in FY 2002 and thus requires fewer spending cuts to achieve a balanced budget. The overall size of the tax cut proposal was reduced by the plan's call for $60 billion in new revenue from closing "corporate loopholes."  Some 43 percent of the revenues generated from these tax hikes would be received in FY 2002.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #6:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The sixth Clinton budget was submitted on January 9. This plan moved only slightly beyond the previous plans, modestly increasing the proposed savings from Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform while slightly boosting the size of the tax cuts. Overall, this Clinton plan would produce nearly $160 billion less in budget savings and nearly $70 billion less in deficit reduction than the last congressional offer. Moreover, the White House still avoided the fundamental reforms in Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare needed to achieve budget savings and restructure the programs.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #7</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The seventh Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on January 18. This budget plan was essentially identical to the January 9 plan except that it substantially increased the amount of new revenues it would generate from closing "corporate tax loopholes" and other such devices. Because of these new revenues, the net size of the tax cut would have been reduced to a mere $36 billion over seven years.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #8: The FY 1997 Budget</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Like the seven budget plans that preceded it during the past year, the FY 1997 Clinton budget, presented to Congress February 5, would have forced hard-working Americans to pay higher taxes in exchange for more spending on programs which have become old and obsolete, or which are ripe for termination, privatization, or transfer to state control. Indeed, compared with the FY 1997 budget resolution passed by Congress in May, Clinton's FY 1997 budget would mean nearly $1,500 in higher taxes and $3,500 in higher spending for every household in America over the next six years. Moreover, the Clinton plan ignores the fundamental problems facing the government's major entitlement and welfare programs. Clinton has shirked his responsibility to address, for instance, a Medicare program facing insolvency, a Medicaid program that is bankrupting state budgets, and a welfare system that perpetuates a culture of poverty.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Repeated gimmicks and ploys such as these indicate that the Clinton Administration probably never has been serious about reaching a balanced budget agreement with Congress. At every turn, President Clinton has fought attempts to cut spending -- or even to reduce the growth rate of spending. Incredibly, Clinton now claims credit for reducing the deficit to a 15-year low when, in fact, it would have been lower had he not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995. The truth is that Congress deserves credit for reversing Clinton policies which would have perpetuated a $200 billion deficit into the next century. The record is clear: Bill Clinton prefers keeping money in the hands of Washington bureaucrats to keeping it in the pockets of American taxpayers.

President Bill Clinton and other opponents of national missile defenses charge it will cost too much to defend Americans against missile attack.<sup>1</sup>  As evidence Clinton points to a May 15 estimate by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that a missile defense system required by the Defend America Act of 1996 would cost as much as $60 billion.<sup>2</sup>  Both the President and the CBO are wrong. Defending America from nuclear attack will not cost as much as the CBO thinks. The U.S. could deploy a missile defense system for as little as $8 billion.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The CBO estimate is wrong because it is based on a flawed assumption that a ground-based system is the best option for ballistic missile defense (BMD). It is not. A sea-based option would not only be more effective, it would cost much less. Besides, the CBO report has been mischaracterized by critics of missile defense. All the critics say is that such a defense will cost $60 billion. What these critics ignore is that in the CBO estimate the initial defense system would cost only a fraction of the $60 billion claimed. The larger total applies to the deployment of several defensive systems, not just one, over a fourteen-year period. Critics pretend that the total cost figure would have to be paid in order to defend America from attack. This is not true. Using CBO's approach, an initial missile defense system costing as little $14 billion could provide coverage for the territory of the United States against very limited attacks with unsophisticated missiles.
<p>
<b>The CBO Report</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Congressional Budget Office is charged by Congress to estimate the budgetary impact of legislation. In performing this function, the CBO issued an estimate on May 15 of the cost of enacting the Defend America Act, which would commit the nation to the deployment of a national missile defense system by 2003. However, the act is essentially a statement of strategic policy goals or priorities. It includes no budgetary authorization and mandates no particular BMD system or "architecture" which can be costed with any precision or certainty. This allowed the CBO to estimate the cost on the basis of its own assumptions. These assumptions led to a general cost estimate of $31 billion to $60 billion to deploy a combination of several national missile defense systems, extending over a fourteen-year period. This wildly varying estimate has been used by critics of missile defense to distort the real cost of missile defenses.
<p>

<b>CBO's flawed assumption.</b> The CBO estimate of the cost of the Defend America Act is based on a flawed assumption: that the ground-based approach pursued by the Clinton Administration is the only option for fielding an initial defense. The CBO began its analysis by examining hypothetical approaches proposed by the Clinton Administration's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO). However, the Clinton Administration is opposed to national missile defenses and has no incentive to discuss the most cost-effective approach to deployment, even hypothetically. The Administration's hypothetical approach would deploy a single site of 100 fixed, ground-based interceptors, as allowed by the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. This system, according to the CBO, would cost $14 billion if an array of sensor satellites were included in the deployment plan. The CBO then added two additional interceptor sites. This ran the cost of the system up, according to the CBO, to $18 billion. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
But the ground-based-only approach is not the only option. In fact, it is the worst option, not only costing too much, but not doing the job of effectively providing a wide-area of coverage against attack. The CBO failed to consider the option of modifying existing Navy AEGIS cruisers to serve as BMD platforms. The Heritage Foundation's Missile Defense Study Team ("Team B") estimates the cost of this alternative at $2-3 billion over six years, with an additional $5 billion for the sensor satellites.<sup>3</sup>  Therefore, the cost of an initial defense could be between $7 billion and $8 billion, as opposed to CBO's estimate of between $14 billion and $18 billion.<p><b>Distortions of the CBO estimate.</b> The failure to consider other more viable options was not the only problem with the CBO estimate. Another is the wide range in the estimate of $31 billion to $60 billion over 14 years. The 100 percent variance in this estimate is so broad as to make it meaningless. No one can seriously base a judgment on it. Estimating the cost of missile defenses over a 14-year period would have been akin to devising a similar cost estimate in 1958 for the cost of five generations of intercontinental ballistic missiles (the <i>Titan I,</i> the <i>Titan II,</i> the <i>Minuteman I,</i> the <i>Minuteman II,</I> and the <i>Minuteman III</i>) through 1972. If the procurement cost of these systems -- likely more than $200 billion -- had been debated prior to the decision to develop ballistic missiles, perhaps Congress would have been equally shocked by the "sticker price" of deploying a nuclear deterrent for the next 14 years. The country should be very glad indeed that the Congress did not engage in such a spurious debate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Further, the assertion that deploying a missile defense system will cost $60 billion distorts the CBO's analysis. First, the $60 billion estimate is an upper limit. Even by its own analysis, CBO's cost of a multiple-system deployment could be as low as $31 billion. Second, this range of estimates covers the period from fiscal 1997 through 2010, or 14 years. That amounts to between $2.2 billion and $4.2 billion per year, or less than 2 percent of annual defense budgets. Third, the five-year estimate (fiscal 1997 through 2001) is less than $10 billion. Finally, and most important, the CBO assessment includes additions to the initial deployment that consist of space-based interceptors and space-based lasers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While any long-term deployment plan may cost any amount of money, the fact remains that CBO's initial deployment of ground-based interceptors, along with sensor satellites, would cost as little as $14 billion. Thus, despite the fact that CBO adopts an expensive approach to missile defense, even its own plan is still clearly affordable under defense budgets that will range between $250 billion and $350 billion per year (as measured in current dollars) for the 14-year period in question.
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The presumed high cost of a national missile defense system serves merely as an excuse, not a reason, to oppose a decision to deploy national missile defenses. The CBO cost estimate is based on the flawed assumption that the Clinton Administration's approach to deployment is the most cost-effective. It is not. For this reason, Congress can safely ignore CBO's estimate and it certainly should ignore the misrepresentations of CBO's analysis provided by President Clinton. The fact is that a decision to deploy a national missile defense system is compatible with the defense budgets proposed by both the Clinton Administration and Congress.

<a href="fyi109t1.gif">Table 1</a>: Comparing this Congress with Clinton's and Reagan's Selected Spending Cuts
<p> 
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Last winter's budget battle between Congress and the President was seen by most observers as a victory for the President and a defeat for fiscal conservatives in Congress who were attempting to make major reductions and reforms in government spending programs. But when the smoke cleared and the fiscal year (FY) 1996 budget process finally came to a close, it was apparent that while a rhetorical battle was lost, the budget war was won by the fiscal conservatives. And the victory was unprecedented in scope.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How complete was the victory?  The 104th Congress:<ul>

<p><li>Reduced year-over-year discretionary spending for the first time since 1969.

<p><li>Reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices between 1994 and 1996.<sup>1</sup>

<p><li>Eliminated over 270 programs, agencies, offices, and projects.

<p><li>Helped reduce the deficit to the lowest level in 14 years. Only President Reagan's FY 1982 budget deficit was lower.

<p><li>Enacted into law more privatizations in just one year than occurred during the entire eight years of the Reagan Administration.

<p><li>Forced a national debate on structural welfare reform and encouraged states to continue to overhaul their welfare systems. Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent-- reducing the demand for federal as well as state dollars. The 104th Congress included as part of welfare reform legislation much of the Wisconsin plan. Unfortunately, President Clinton chose to veto the bill.

<p><li>Deregulated the agriculture and telecommunications industries. Congress passed a 1996 farm bill that begins to bring an end to costly Depression-era agriculture programs by getting government out of the business of telling farmers what to grow. This was the most sweeping reform in 60 years. Farmers increasingly will be able to grow to meet the demands of the market rather than the federal government. In addition, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 eliminates decades worth of outdated rules and restrictions on the telephone, cable, and broadcast industries. It will expand job and export opportunities within the industry, lower the cost of basic communications services, and free consumers to choose between competing providers of service.</ul><p>



<b>WHAT BUDGET DEFEAT?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although many in Congress have come to believe that they lost the budget war, the facts indicate otherwise. As the final FY 1996 budget reveals, this Congress accomplished an unprecedented reduction and elimination of unneeded federal programs, federal bureaucrats, and federal spending. To be sure, Congress did not close any of the four Cabinet departments -- Commerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development -- it targeted. Nor did it see its ambitious national reforms in welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare signed into law. But the hundreds of reforms it did accomplish were comprehensive and far-reaching. Indeed, many of its accomplishments were far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan Administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In the discretionary budget accounts alone, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969 as a result of program terminations and major cuts. More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. These include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts, the Office of Technology Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Bureau of Mines, the Administrative Conference of the United States, and hundreds of other programs throughout the government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	And whereas Congress fell short in its efforts to terminate such targeted programs as the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Legal Services Corporation, it cut their budgets substantially and forced them to curtail activities. Indeed, even by early Reagan-era standards, the reforms are unprecedented. Examples:<ul>

<p><li>The first Reagan budget proposed to cut the National Endowment for the Arts by 27 percent, but achieved a 17 percent reduction. This Congress cut the Endowment by 38 percent. 

<p><li>Reagan wanted the National Endowment for the Humanities cut by 23 percent in his first budget, but achieved 20 percent. This Congress cut it by 36 percent.

<p><li>Reagan proposed to cut mass transit subsidies by 10 percent; this Congress cut them by 43 percent.

<p><li>Congress cut the Appalachian Regional Commission by 39 percent and the Legal Services Corporation by 33 percent. Both agencies were slated for termination by the Reagan Administration and by this Congress, but both survived, albeit with significant reductions in funding. 

<p><li>HUD's budget was cut by $2.6 billion -- or by 10 percent compared with spending for the previous year. 

<p><li>Both this Congress and the Reagan Administration failed in their plans to eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which once again demonstrated its impressive skills at self-preservation, but this Congress made a real and deep cut. Reagan proposed a 25 percent cut, but CPB's budget rose $10 million in his first year. This Congress substantially reduced CPB's spending last year through the rescission process, cutting planned spending by $37 million in 1996 and $55 million in 1997.</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


As a result of these and hundreds of other cuts, freezes, and terminations, this year's budget deficit is expected to total $146.3 billion, in contrast to the $193.8 billion expected for this year by President Clinton as part of his budget plan in 1993, and the $196 billion projected in the FY 1996 baseline. Importantly, three-quarters of this deficit improvement is due to the spending reductions enacted by the 104th Congress. As noted earlier, FY 1996's projected deficit will be the lowest since President Reagan's FY 1982 budget.
<p>

<b>HOW CLINTON HAS TRIED TO STOP ENTITLEMENT REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Obviously, the deficit would have been much lower had Congress been as successful with the federal entitlement programs as it was with the discretionary spending accounts. Unfortunately, multiple vetoes by the President of repeated congressional efforts to enact reforms in major entitlement programs like welfare, Medicare, and Medicaid have left federal spending higher than it could have been and rendered future reform efforts more difficult.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But in welfare, at least, the congressional emphasis on welfare reform, including its passage by the House as part of the Contract with America, has encouraged many states to press the White House for waivers of current rules to enable these states to reform their welfare systems along the lines proposed by the House and Senate. President Clinton, fortunately, has agreed to many of these waiver requests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	As a result of these reforms, and despite the lackluster national economy, the number of Americans on welfare has fallen by 1.3 million between 1993 and the present, for an overall decline of 9 percent. <sup>2</sup> Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent.Unfortunately, President Clinton has blocked the rapid expansion of successful state programs like Wisconsin's to the rest of the nation by vetoing federal welfare reform legislation that would have removed the need for cumbersome waiver requests.
<p>

<b>PRIVATIZATION FINALLY MOVES FORWARD</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Perhaps in no other area was the difference between past and present performance as dramatic as it was in the 104th Congress's success in privatizing government-run enterprises. Spurred forward by the House Speaker's appointment of Representative Scott Klug (R-WI) to head up the House's privatization effort, numerous privatizations have been successfully concluded, often with bipartisan support and White House cooperation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The Reagan Administration was able to privatize only Conrail and the National Consumer Cooperative Bank, because of intense congressional opposition during the 1980s. But in one year, this Congress has enacted legislation to privatize four major government programs. Although first proposed and developed in the mid-1980s by the Reagan Administration, it took this Congress to pass the legislation (which the President signed into law) to privatize the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, the Naval Petroleum Reserve, and the Alaska Power Marketing Administration. Passed by the House and awaiting action in the Senate is legislation to privatize the government's National Helium Reserve in Texas. Although final transfer prices remain to be determined, the estimated revenues to the federal treasury from these four sales will be several billion dollars.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In addition to these asset sales, this Congress has initiated many contracting out opportunities which will allow the government to provide better services at lower costs. During the first session, for example, Congress enacted legislation to contract out the Internal Revenue Service's debt collection efforts, the General Services Administration's commercial real estate brokerage functions, the special forecasting functions of the National Weather Service, and selective map-making functions throughout the federal establishment.

	Perhaps encouraged by the more favorable privatization environment in Congress, the Clinton Administration dusted off and improved a Reagan Administration proposal -- called Fed Co-Op -- to set in motion an employee buyout of the background investigations functions previously provided by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.<sup>3</sup>  Involving approximately 700 federal employees, and structured as an employee stock ownership plan with a projected 90 percent employee ownership share, the transfer is scheduled to take place in mid-July. Unfortunately, there are concerns that some House lawmakers may attempt to thwart it in an effort to preserve the civil service status    quo.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	More generally, Congress included in this year's defense authorization bill (Section 357 of P.L. 104-106) language that mandates a more systematic appraisal of contracting opportunities within the Department of Defense (DOD). Although Defense has been one of the few government agencies to take advantage of contracting opportunities, much more could be done. DOD estimates that its cost savings through contracting have averaged 31 percent on contract competitions between 1978 and 1994, and that the savings now total nearly $1.5 billion per year. <sup>4</sup> 
<p>

<b>OTHER POLICY CHANGES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Both the telcommunications and agriculture sectors of the economy were the targets of significant legislative reforms that will place more responsibility and decision making in the hands of private participants operating in the competitive marketplace. And just getting underway in Congress are a series of efforts to overhaul the federal government's involvement in virtually all facets of America's national and local transportation systems. Perhaps indicative of the shape this effort will ultimately take are some innovative pieces of legislation that have been or soon will be introduced in Congress. These include prospective legislation that would devolve much of the federal highway program to the states, as well as existing legislation that would privatize the airports, transfer Amtrak responsibilities to regional compacts created by the states, and remove the trouble-plagued Federal Aviation Administration from the Department of Transportation.
<p>

<b>THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 As impressive as this Congress's performance was, it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervades the federal government. As noted earlier, largely untouched were the costly entitlement programs for welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare. These should be revisited during the FY 1997 budget process and should be campaign issues at all levels of government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Furthermore, opportunities for extensive and cost-saving privatization remain, with the four power marketing administrations prime candidates for commercialization and self-sufficiency. Potential revenues to the government from their sale have been estimated at between $8 billion and $20 billion.<sup>5</sup>  Other areas for privatization include all facets of government's role in the transportation sector, including airports, air traffic control, highways, mass transit, and Amtrak. And building on the progress described earlier, Congress and the Administration should be more aggressive in seeking contracting opportunities to improve service at reduced costs. As noted in a Heritage study published last year, budgetary savings of at least $9 billion per year could be achieved through contracting.<sup>6</sup> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	 Finally, and notwithstanding the impressive reforms made in the thousands of discretionary government programs, much more could and should be done. Savings of an additional $20 billion should be the goal of the FY 1997 budget. As a casual reading of the hundreds of reports produced by the government's Inspectors General reveals, waste and mismanagement are still pervasive throughout the federal establishment and have largely survived the first round of budget cuts. Indeed, there is recent evidence to suggest that in response to budget cuts, government bureaucracies have engaged in the traditional "Washington Monument" ploy -- cut services to the public instead of making efficiencies in program overhead.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	For example, the National Park Service has been highly resistant to the use of contractors to provide routine services such as entrance fee collection, janitorial work, and campground management, preferring instead to use more costly uniformed personnel to perform these services. As a result, and in response to limits placed on the growth of its budget, the Park Service has announced a series of service cutbacks in the form of reduced hours and closed campgrounds just as vacation season is getting underway. Such bureaucratic games should not be tolerated by Congress. Lawmakers should require the Park Service to seek savings through management efficiencies rather than service cutbacks. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The record of the last year's budget battle clearly demonstrates that, although the tactical victory may belong to the President, the strategic victory belongs to the 104th Congress. Many of its members, particulary the freshmen, arrived in Washington with an electoral mandate to cut the budget. It was a mandate they honored, and in doing so they accomplished the first reduction in discretionary spending since 1969.

<a href="fyi110c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Money Available to Pay for Hospital Benefits<br>
<a href="fyi110c2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Who Pays for Part B Costs?<br>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The latest annual report of the Medicare Board of Trustees underscores the severe financial plight of the program and the urgent need for structural reform. The six trustees, who include three Clinton Administration Cabinet secretaries, make clear that no amount of fine-tuning can stave off disaster. The report indicates that the only way to assure Medicare's ability to deliver adequate health care to most of today's senior citizens, let alone the next generation of elderly Americans, is to overhaul the program now so that it can deliver better care for less money.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Most of the recent media attention given to the report has focused on the trustees' assessment of the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund, also known as Part A. The trust fund is like a savings account, where the income is payroll tax revenue and the outlays pay for services. The problem is that for a number of reasons, most significantly the aging of the baby-boom generation, the trust fund is being hit by a financing windshear, already causing outlays to exceed income and exhausting all reserves by 2001. In other words, the fund in 2002 literally would have no money to pay promised benefits. Thereafter, for at least the next 70 years (the limit of the trustees' projections), the cost of continuing services would continue to exceed program income.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Absent any reform, Medicare can continue after 2001 only if it drastically cuts services or tries to keep the HI program afloat with tax increases. But the cost of a bailout would be staggering. The report indicates that the cumulative deficit in the trust fund (that is, the extra money needed to maintain services) would be over $400 billion by 2005. In that year alone, outlays would exceed income by over $100 billion, and the red ink would be accelerating annually. So just to continue hospital services until 2005, the bailout cost to the average American household would be about $4,000 in new taxes. As the trustees conclude, with classic understatement, "The HI program remains severely out of balance."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But that is just Part A. Part B of Medicare, which pays for physician and other services, is financed only partly by premiums (which cover about 30 percent of program costs), with the rest financed by general revenues. The level of taxpayer subsidy has nothing to do with the beneficiary's income -- elderly millionaires get the same subsidy as the poor. Under current law, say the trustees, taxpayers will have to cover 84 percent of Part B costs by 2005 and an increasing proportion thereafter. According to the trustees' figures, the cumulative taxpayer subsidy between 1996 and 2005 alone will be $950 billion, or roughly $10,000 in taxes for the average American household. The figures for succeeding decades will be even larger.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Taking the two parts of Medicare together, to keep the program afloat just until 2005 without reforms will take about $14,000 per household in taxes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unfortunately, this stark picture prompts the trustees to call for "the earliest possible enactment of legislation" only to delay bankruptcy for a few years, not to address the long-term problem. Instead, they call for a national commission to recommend long-term solutions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Such a commission would be a serious mistake. Rather than encourage serious public discussion of the tough choices that must be faced, it would allow nervous politicians to believe they can avoid the issue of Medicare for a few more years. But by then the choices would be more limited and the necessary action more drastic.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Advocates of a commission point to previous examples of supposedly successful commissions in making the case for a Medicare commission. Most often they cite the 1982 Social Security commission and the recent panel on military base closures. But the experience of commissions intended to produce legislation is that they are successful in only two situations: first, when only a relatively small mid-course correction is needed in the funding of a sensitive program to keep it in operation for many years (the Social Security commission), or second, when there is almost unanimous agreement on what needs to be done and the commission merely provides political protection (base closing).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Medicare fits into neither of these categories. The problem is not small and short-term: It is massive and structural. And there is no consensus on what needs to be done. To deal with Medicare, major and controversial decisions will have to be made concerning the nature of the entitlement, the benefits, and the role of the taxpayer. These already have been discussed at length on Capitol Hill. In fact, legislative decisions were taken last year, only to be vetoed by President Clinton. All a commission can do, in effect, is take a year or so to put the options already known into a single binder and deliver them back to Capitol Hill. But Congress and the President will still have to make the tough choices --a commission would not render them any easier. With the program so close to collapse, it would be much wiser for the elected government to begin making those decisions today, preferably with the President as an active partner.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To achieve long-term stability in Medicare, three broad changes are needed to encourage much greater efficiency by giving much more economic control and more sensible incentives to the elderly. The bill Congress enacted last year would have begun this reform, but was vetoed. Specifically, Congress and the White House should:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Turn Medicare into a defined contribution program.</b> Medicare currently promises a set of specific benefits, rather than a certain degree of assistance to seniors to purchase the benefits they want. Moving to a defined contribution system would give the elderly much greater choice and an incentive to seek better value for money.
<p>
<li><b> Open up new plan choices for the elderly.</b> In today's Medicare, benefits are designed and priced in Washington and updated only slowly, if at all, after months or years of intense debate and lobbying in Washington. That is why the elderly are still waiting for the kind of routine drug benefits, or service options, that are available in almost any standard private plan -- or to retired federal workers in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). Thus, allowing seniors the right to choose from a wide range of plans and benefit packages is needed to modernize coverage. It also is needed to spur competition between plans to provide the best value for money for seniors.
<P>
<li><b> Reduce the Part B subsidy for those who do not need it.</b> Part B is not a social insurance program. It is a heavily subsidized, optional, government-run physician insurance program. Rich elderly Americans receive the same subsidy as seniors who rely entirely on their Social Security checks. It is time for Congress to rein in the unwarranted taxpayer-funded subsidy for those who do not need it to afford health care.
</ul> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Medicare trustees' report is grim reading. It refutes utterly the nave idea that only a little fine-tuning is needed for the program to exist for the next generation of elderly Americans. The report makes clear that there are only three choices available: massive tax increases, draconian benefit cuts, or structural reforms to enable the program to deliver health care at less cost. Obviously, only the third choice makes any sense. The quicker Congress and the White House begin those reforms, the less painful they will be.

May 14, 1996 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Even assuming the Clinton Administration's forecast for this year is accurate, the United States economy's performance since 1989 will have been the worst seven-year period since the end of World War II. Adjusted for inflation, median household income has declined by 6.6 percent since Ronald Reagan left office.<sup>1</sup>  And while the unemployment rate is reasonably low, many Americans are worried about the future and fear their children will be the first generation to have a lower standard of living than its parents. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The economy's sub-par performance has triggered a debate on how best to stimulate economic growth and boost income. The good news is that all sides of the debate agree that the key to economic growth is capital formation -- increasing the levels of savings and investment (including investments in human capital). The bad news, however, is that there is a significant disagreement over the policy changes that will best meet that goal. On one side are those who argue that high tax rates dampen incentives and believe that correcting the anti-savings, anti-investment bias of the current income tax code will improve the economy's performance. The flat tax, they would argue, offers the best opportunity to generate a substantial and positive impact on job creation and income growth. The other side of the debate is dominated by those who believe the most important variable is the budget deficit. They argue that a lower budget deficit will lead to significant reductions in interest rates and that lower interest rates will spur higher levels of investment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, no discussion of economic growth would be complete without addressing the size of government. Regardless of whether it is financed through taxes or borrowing, government spending represents a transfer of resources from the private sector to the public sector. If government spends that money in a way that generates a sufficiently high rate of return, the economy will benefit. If the rate of return is below that of the private sector, however, then the rate of growth will be slower than it otherwise would have been.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Needless to say, the debate over growth has important policy implications. Should taxes be increased or decreased?  Should the budget be balanced and, if so, how quickly?  Is the deficit the real problem, or is it a symptom of an underlying problem of too much government?  What is the impact of tax reform?  What types of government spending count as investment?  If certain policies increase growth, should that higher growth be included in government economic and revenue estimates?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Careful analysis of the historical and theoretical evidence yields three important conclusions that can help guide policymakers as they focus on the nation's economic problems:<ol>

	
<p><li>The tax system is taking too much money out of the productive sector of the economy. Perhaps even more important, the structure of the tax system is grossly flawed and imposes a particularly steep penalty on the very behaviors -- saving and investing -- that are needed to promote growth.

<p><li>Government borrowing is morally wrong because it imposes bills on future generations,<sup>2</sup> but the deficit should not drive economic policy. Contrary to what both political parties argue, there does not seem to be a strong relationship between the budget deficit and interest rates. Nor is there much reason to believe that lower interest rates, by themselves, will have a pronounced effect on investment. Moreover, focusing on the deficit can undermine sound economic policy by leading some to view higher taxes as an appropriate policy option.

<p><li>Government spending is too high. Many programs fail to generate an adequate rate of return (and many, such as welfare programs, almost certainly have a negative return and have made things worse). Not all government spending, needless to say, is dependent on "rates of return," but legislators should fully understand that funding programs with money that could be more productively used by the private sector will result in less economic growth. Finally, for those who do view the deficit as the key variable, there is ample evidence that slowing the growth of spending -- not higher taxes -- is the only way to achieve a balanced budget.
</ol>

<p>
<b>Why Capital Matters</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As stated above, there is very little controversy about what causes growth. There is near-unanimous agreement that salaries and wages are linked closely to productivity. The only way to raise the income of workers permanently -- assuming no change in their skills -- is through savings and investment. Simply put, workers are paid on the basis of what they produce, and giving them better tools allows them to produce more. The level of capital formation, for instance, largely explains why workers in the United States, Germany, and Japan earn more than workers in Brazil, India, and Nigeria. Similarly, workers in America today earn more than their parents because of net investment (increases in the capital stock). As a result, they are more productive, generating more output per hour of labor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Economists of all persuasions recognize this relationship between investment and wages. Paul Samuelson, for example, a Nobel Laureate economist who endorsed Bill Clinton for President, has written:<blockquote>

	What happens to the wage rate now that each person works with more capital goods?  Because each worker has more capital to work with, his or her marginal product rises. Therefore, the competitive real wage rises as workers become worth more to capitalists and meet with spirited bidding up of their market wage rates.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Another example is taken from a 1991 report on economic growth prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, then controlled by the Democrats:
<blockquote>
	When an economy's rate of net investment (gross investment less depreciation)<sup>4</sup> increases, the economy's stock of capital increases. A larger capital stock permits a fixed amount of labor to produce more goods and services. The larger a country's capital stock, the more productive its workers and, generally, the higher its real wages and salaries. Thus, increases in investment tend to cause future increases in a nation's standard of living.<sup>5</sup>
</blockquote>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; According to a 1989 report on economic growth published by the Congressional Research Service:
<blockquote>
	Capital deepening has been and will likely continue to be a central force for accelerating growth and potential output over the medium term. But as we have seen, a permanent increase in the long-term rate of growth will hinge on the United States' ability to increase the pace of technical advance and innovation. However, both of these routes to faster growth will be contingent upon the ability to increase the level of investment spending -- more spending for capital equipment and more spending for research and development. To finance higher investment will, in turn, require that Americans raise the national rate of savings.<sup>6</sup>
</blockquote>
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Or consider the views of the White House. In the 1994 Economic Report of the President, the Administration noted that:
<blockquote>
	The reasons for wanting to raise the investment share of the GDP [gross domestic product] are straightforward: Workers are more productive when they are equipped with more and better capital, more productive workers earn higher real wages, and higher real wages are the mainspring of higher living standards. Few economic propositions are better supported than these -- or more important.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Competing Theories of Growth</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Every economic school of thought -- even Marxism -- agrees that capital formation is the key to rising living standards. This happy consensus, however, does not translate into agreement about how to spur more savings and investment. In the political economic debate, at least in America, there are basically three (actually two and one-half) views on how to promote economic growth. These are:<ul>

<p><li><b>Old-Fashioned Keynesianism.</b> This is the half-theory because it has so few adherents in America. In periods of economic sluggishness, Keynesians believe the government should increase spending, financed by borrowing, to give the economy a shot in the arm. This spending is supposed to stimulate aggregate demand, which causes private sector behavior to perk up. With a handful of exceptions, such as the failed 1993 stimulus bill, this approach does not receive much attention in Washington.

<p><li><b>1950s Republican/1990s Democrat Balanced Budget Orthodoxy.</b> The title is made up because this school of thought does not really have a name. Proponents of this approach, which is dominant in Washington, believe that the economy hinges on changes in the budget deficit. Contrary to old-fashioned Keynesianism, however, this orthodox approach argues that reducing the budget deficit is the key to economic growth. The theory works as follows: A lower budget deficit leads to lower interest rates, lower interest rates lead to more investment, more investment leads to higher productivity, and higher productivity means more growth. Although some of the proponents favor smaller government as a philosophical goal, the balanced budget crowd does not think taxes have a major effect on incentives to engage in productive behavior. As a result, they are skeptical of tax cuts and instead are willing to raise taxes.

<p><li><b>The Free Market.</b> Another made-up title because other options -- supply-side, conservative, classical liberal -- do not capture the central tenet, the free-market approach believes that the keys to economic growth, at least in terms of fiscal policy, are the size of government and the structure of the tax system. In short, the free-market approach believes that total spending, regardless of whether it is financed by taxes or borrowing, hinders the economy's performance by transferring scarce resources from those in the private sector who have incentives to use them wisely to politicians and bureaucrats who oftentimes respond to political incentives. Because the size of government matters, free market advocates would prefer a government with a $1 trillion budget and a $200 billion deficit to a government with a $2 trillion budget that was balanced. On the tax side of the ledger, free market supporters believe taxes affect incentives to work, save, and invest. A major goal of these folks, therefore, is radical tax reform designed to minimize tax rates and eliminate multiple taxation of capital. These reforms, it is believed, will boost capital formation, which will increase productivity, which means faster economic growth.
</ul><p>


<b>Who Is Right?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The policy debate in Washington largely revolves between Options 2 and 3 (though there is also a fight amongst supporters of Option 2 over the size of government -- Should the budget be balanced at level "X" or level "X+Y?"). Stripping away much of the rhetoric, the victor in this struggle depends on which set of relationships is more robust:
<ol>
<p><li>Are balanced budget proponents right that interest rates will fall significantly once deficit spending comes to an end?  And are they correct in believing that investment is very sensitive to interest rates?

<p><li>Are free market supporters correct in believing that there is an inverse relationship between economic growth and the size of government?  Even more important, are they accurate in stating that decisions to work, save, and invest are significantly altered by the tax code?
</ul>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; In some sense, both sides are right. Unless economists want to repeal the laws of supply and demand, there can be no doubt that lower budget deficits will lower interest rates. And, all other things being equal, lower interest rates should mean more investment. It is also unambiguously true that lower taxes will reduce the price of providing labor and capital to the economy. And it is certainly accurate to note that a large government, by reducing the cost of not working, will adversely affect the economy's performance. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The real question is the magnitude of these effects. Would balancing the budget really reduce interest rates by two percentage points?  Is the level of investment primarily driven by the interest rate?  Just how sensitive are decisions to work, save, and invest to the rate of taxation?  To what extent do government spending programs actually undermine work effort?
<p>

<b>Doubts Regarding Balanced Budget Orthodoxy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There is ample reason to question the robustness of the interest rate argument. According to the theory, lower budget deficits should result in lower interest rates. Yet there is little evidence to suggest that interest rates are significantly affected by changes in the U.S. budget deficit. This does not mean that the laws of supply and demand have been repealed. It simply means that in world capital markets, a shift of $30 billion, $40 billion, or $50 billion is unlikely to have a dramatic effect and can easily be overwhelmed by other factors such as monetary policy and demand for credit. <sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even if interest rates fall by a significant amount, the second link in the balanced budget chain of reasoning is very weak. Yes, interest rates must affect investment choices, but it appears that this variable is dwarfed by other influences.<sup>8</sup>  Why invest, for instance, if there is no hope of making a profit?  Real interest rates were negative during the 1930s in America, yet investment was moribund because investors did not see many opportunities to earn an adequate rate of return. Likewise, real interest rates were high in America during much of the 1980s, yet investment rose because people saw ways to make money. Moreover, since a large portion of investment is self-financed on the part of business, it is difficult to see how interest rates would have a dramatic impact.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All things being equal, it is a good idea to balance the budget. And, yes, lower interest rates will promote investment. Balancing the budget, however, is not a silver bullet for the economy. This approach is especially short-sighted if it is used as a reason to raise taxes or block pro-growth tax cuts. As the following section illustrates, changes in tax policy can have a pronounced effect on the economy's performance.

<p>
<b>Why Free Market Supporters Are Right About Taxes and Capital Formation</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The attached appendices provide a sampling of empirical work on the impact of taxes. To put that work in context, however, it is useful to walk through an example illustrating just how heavy the tax burden is on savings and investment. Between personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, capital gains taxes, and estate taxes, a single dollar of investment income can be subject to as many as four layers of tax in America. Added to that burden are provisions of the law, such as depreciation and the alternative minimum tax, which force taxpayers to overstate their income. Adding insult to injury is the heavy compliance cost of the current system. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The following example illustrates why savings and investment suffer in the current tax climate. A taxpayer has $100 of income and must decide what to do with it. He can consume the $100, spending it on food, vacations, clothing, haircuts, or some other product or service, in which case (with the exception of possible sales taxes) he will receive close to $100 in goods and services for his money. Or he can invest in the stock of a start-up company with the potential to provide new jobs to the community and produce goods that consumers desire. If the company succeeds, the investor most likely will profit. If it fails, he will lose his $100.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In this case, the investment bears fruit and yields a 10 percent rate of return, enabling the company to produce $10 of annual income for every $100 invested. Under the current tax code, 35 percent is skimmed off to pay the corporate income tax, leaving only $6.50 out of the original $10. This $6.50 then goes to the investor as a dividend. But there are other taxes. Depending on the investor's income, the personal income tax will take as much as 39.6 percent of his $6.50, leaving him with less than $4.00 of annual income from a "successful" $100 investment. In addition, he may face applicable state and local income taxes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, if the investor ever decides to sell the stock, he will be hit by one of the highest capital gains taxes in the industrialized world. To make a bad situation even worse, he will be taxed on the nominal gains, often meaning that taxes are paid on assets that have lost value in real terms (and do not forget that the person who sold him the stock originally may have been subject to capital gains taxes on that sale). The final insult is the estate and gift tax. Successful entrepreneurs who try to accumulate an estate to pass on to their children are penalized by inheritance taxes which can confiscate 55 percent of a deceased's assets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Thanks to the tax code, a fortunate investor -- one who actually earns money on his investments -- may have to send more than 80 percent of his earnings to the government, not to mention having already paid taxes on the money used for the investment in the first place. Thus, government tax policy has created a very tilted playing field. By punishing saving and investment, the tax code encourages both individuals and businesses to consume rather than to build for America's future.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Since taxes have such a dramatic impact on incentives to work, save, and invest, it should come as no surprise that major tax changes almost always have a significant impact on the economy. Herbert Hoover's decision in 1930 to increase the top tax rate from 25 percent to 63 percent certainly contributed to the Depression. Lyndon Johnson's surtax on income tax liabilities, enacted in 1968, together with an increase in the capital gains tax helped end the 1960s expansion. Large tax increases, including inflation-induced bracket creep, contributed to the economy's dismal performance under Jimmy Carter. George Bush's record tax increase in 1990 was a principal cause of the recent recession and subsequent anemic recovery. And the sub-par performance of today's economy, particularly the decline in median household income, almost certainly is attributable in part to the record tax increase pushed through Congress in 1993 by Bill Clinton.
<p>


<b>The Answer: The Flat Tax</b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Each of the tax code's many shortcomings can be addressed by targeted legislation, but a far better approach is simply to replace the existing system with a flat tax. There have been many flat tax proposals over the years, but they all share certain key features. These are:
<ul><p><li><b>One low tax rate.</b> All flat tax proposals have a single tax rate that applies to all income subject to tax. The actual rate imposed varies, but the upper limit would be about 20 percent. The Armey-Shelby flat tax legislation, for instance, begins with a 20 percent rate which phases down to 17 percent after a couple of years.

<p><li><b>Tax income only once.</b> Flat tax proposals are designed to eliminate the tax code's bias against capital formation by ending the double- (and sometimes triple- and quadruple-) taxation of income generated through savings and investment. The key principle is that the tax code not discriminate against income that is used for savings and investment as opposed to income that is consumed. 

<p><li><b>Elimination of deductions, credits, and exemptions.</b> All pure flat tax proposals eliminate provisions of the tax code that bestow preferential tax treatment on certain behaviors and activities. Included in this would be special tax breaks for businesses and corporations and, for individual taxpayers, the home mortgage interest deduction, the charitable contributions deduction, and the state and local mortgage interest deduction. Eliminating these "loopholes" solves the problem of complexity, allowing taxpayers to file their tax returns on a postcard-sized form.

<p>
</ul>
<b>Benefits of a Flat Tax</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By addressing the many problems of the existing tax code in one fell swoop, the flat tax would have an immediate and dramatic positive impact. Included among the benefits are:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Faster economic growth.</b> A flat tax would spur increased work, saving, and investment. According to many economists, the rise in productive behavior would likely add one percentage point to the annual rate of economic growth. How significant is this?  An increase in the growth rate of just one-half of one percentage point would boost an average family of four's yearly income by more than $5,000 after ten years.

<p><li><b>Instant wealth creation.</b> Eliminating the second, third, and fourth layers of taxation on capital income would significantly boost the value of all income-producing assets. According to Professor Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University, enactment of a flat tax would immediately boost wealth by some $1 trillion.

<p><li><b>Simplicity.</b> The 600-plus tax forms of the current system would be swept into the trash and replaced by two simple postcard-sized forms. Wage, salary, and pension income would be reported on the individual form and business and capital income would be reported on the business form. Neither form would require more than a few minutes to complete, substantially reducing the 5.4 billion-hour yearly burden of today's tax code.

<p><li><b>Fairness. All taxpayers and all income would be treated equally.</b> A taxpayer with ten times the taxable income of his neighbor would pay ten times as much in taxes. Successful entrepreneurs no longer would be penalized by discriminatory tax rates, and no longer would the politically well-connected by able to benefit from special loopholes and preferences.

<p><li><b>An end to micromanagement and political favoritism.</b> All deductions, credits, exemptions, loopholes, and preferences would be eliminated under a flat tax. Politicians would lose their ability to pick winners and losers, reward friends and punish enemies, use the tax code to impose their values on the economy. Investment decisions would be guided by economic forces rather than tax considerations.

<p><li><b>Increased civil liberties.</b> The complexity of the tax code makes it nearly impossible for either taxpayers or IRS agents to follow the law. A greatly simplified tax code would eliminate virtually all of the conflicts and controversies that make the IRS one of the most feared agencies of the federal government.
</ul><p>

<b>The Spending Problem</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While current tax policy represents a huge impediment to economic growth, policymakers also must focus on the size of government. To the extent that politicians and bureaucrats do not spend money as wisely or efficiently as it would be spent in the private sector, economic growth will lag as government increases in size. More specifically, many government programs do not generate benefits (or minimize costs) to the economy that  exceed those which would have occurred had the money remained in private hands. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The appropriate approach for policymakers is to determine whether spending for a given program will yield enough benefits to offset the loss of the money to the private sector (including the incentive and compliance costs of collecting taxes). A certain level of transportation spending, for instance, will facilitate economic growth by permitting the efficient flow of goods and services. Policymakers should debate, of course, whether the spending could be privatized or conducted at the state and local level. And to the extent they believe it has to be conducted by Washington, they should do their best to ensure that funding is allocated according to sound guidelines rather than pork-barrel politics. Other types of spending, such as crime prevention, also may help the economy by reducing the cost of crime.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In too many cases, however, there is strong reason to believe that the federal government is spending money in ways that do not produce good results for the economy. Some programs, such as welfare, reduce the cost of not working and inevitably undermine productive economic behavior. Other types of spending, such as the budgets for regulatory agencies, can have significantly negative rates of return because of the heavy costs they impose on the private sector. Unfortunately, policy makers usually do not subject government programs to this type of cost/benefit analysis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Note that one important conclusion from using this approach is that the deficit is not the critical variable. The key is the size of government, not how it is financed. Taxes and deficits are both harmful, but the real problem is that government is taking money from the private sector and spending it in ways that often are counter-productive. As a result, fiscal policy should focus on reducing the level of government spending, with particular emphasis on those programs that yield the lowest benefits and/or impose the highest costs. The importance of reducing spending, it should be noted, exists regardless of whether the budget happens to be balanced and is not contingent on changes in the tax system (just as reforming the tax system and adopting other pro-growth tax changes should not be contingent on what happens to the spending side of the ledger).
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	There is no magic formula to boost growth. The economy can only grow if people work more or work better. Unfortunately, much of the world has adopted policies that impose increasingly steep tax penalties on those who add to the economy's wealth. Compounding the damage of these policies are spending programs that shield people from taking responsibility for their own lives. The combination has been an unmitigated failure. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This raises a particularly important issue for those on the left. They must decide what is more important: keeping a tax system that may satisfy an ideological impulse to punish success, or adopting a system that helps boost the living standards of the less fortunate. It is certainly true that modest reforms like reducing the tax rate on capital gains or big reforms like the flat tax will boost after-tax income of the rich. The empirical evidence, however, shows that other income classes will benefit as well -- and may benefit even more.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Critics of tax reform complain that it is nothing more than "trickle-down" economics that relies on tax cuts for the "rich" to boost wages. Such rhetoric may be useful politically, but it cannot change economic reality. Economist John Shoven has explained:<blockquote>

	The mechanism of raising real wages by stimulating investment is sometimes derisively referred to as "trickle-down" economics. But regardless of the label used, no one doubts that the primary mechanism for raising the return to work is providing each worker with better and more numerous tools. One can wonder about the length of time it takes for such a policy of increasing saving and investments to have a pronounced effect on wages, but I know of no one who doubts the correctness of the underlying mechanism. In fact, most economists would state the <I>only</I> way to increase real wages in the long run is through extra investments per worker.<sup>10</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For a profession usually chided for its lack of agreement, economists are nearly unanimous in their recognition that capital formation is the key to economic growth. Policymakers seeking to boost living standards and take-home pay face two competing options for how best to achieve the goal of more savings and investment: Should they focus on the deficit or should they shrink the size of government and reform the tax system?  While these goals need not conflict, to the extent there is a division, there should be little doubt that a myopic fixation on the deficit will not necessarily produce the right policy results. Adopting a flat tax, by contrast, combined with long-overdue reductions in the level of government spending, will generate the desired outcome of a more prosperous economy.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Joint research by economists from Princeton University and Brigham Young University, based on a random survey of physicians, found that a one percentage point increase in marginal tax rates is associated with a reduction of as much as 1.11 percent in hours worked.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A University of California economist found that because of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (which lowered tax rates), the work effort of high-income married women rose by 0.8 percent for every one percent their after-tax wages increased.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another economist found that "Husbands of retirement age, 60 and over, show substantial variation in hours of work, related systematically to wages and income in the expected way."  Moreover, "Wives in all age groups are quite sensitive to wages and income."<sup>13</sup>  In other words, as after-tax income falls, so does the incentive to work.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two other economists estimated that "wives' labor supply will increase by 3.8 percent" in response to a reduction in the marriage penalty.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A comprehensive study in <I>The Journal of Human Resources</I> found that taxes reduce married males' hours of work by 2.6 percent and married females' by between 10 percent and 30 percent.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to a statistical study in <I>Econometrica</I>, yearly hours of work for white married women increase by 2.3 percent for every one percent increase in after-tax earnings.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While husbands are not as sensitive to taxes as wives, the impact of taxes on their behavior is nonetheless dramatic. One study found that they work eight percent less than they would in the absence of taxes.<sup>17</sup>  This indicates a loss in economic output of at least $1,000 per person.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All studies acknowledge that higher after-tax incomes increase incentives to work by increasing the "price" of leisure, but some assume this effect is offset because lower taxes allow workers to achieve a certain level of income by working fewer hours. While this trade-off is relevant when looking at individual choices, two economists note that "the generalization of the individual analysis to the economy as a whole is invalid" because "It will be impossible for all individuals to consume both more goods and more leisure as the individual work-leisure analysis implies."<sup>19</sup>  The actual economy-wide response to changes in tax rates will be higher than almost all studies indicate.<sup>20</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	One econometric model found that a one percent reduction in tax rates increased work effort for lower-income workers by 0.1 percent, for middle and upper-middle-income workers by 0.25 percent, and for upper-income workers by more than 2.0 percent.<sup>21</sup>

<p>
<center><b>APPENDIX 2:<br> Taxes Reduce Savings and Investment</b><p>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In a book on taxes and capital formation, Norman B. Ture and B. Kenneth Sanden noted, "The bias against saving in the present tax system results from the fact that, with few exceptions, taxes are imposed both on the amount of current saving and on the future returns to such saving, whereas the tax falls only once on income used for consumption."<sup>22</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Economist John Shoven estimates that a reduction of 20 percent in the top rate for capital gains would cause the stock market to rise by 3 percent.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Undersecretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers has written that "increases in the real after-tax rate of return received by savers would lead to substantial increases in long-run capital accumulation."  Further, "bequests may account for a large fraction of national capital formation," which strengthens the argument that taxes influence savings.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A study in <I>The American Political Science Review</I> noted that "Nations... where the extractive [tax] capacity of government did not significantly increase, relative to the economic product, have, in a sense, opted for... an increasing rate of private capital accumulation."<sup>25</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Analyzing the decline in savings, a study by three experts concluded that Social Security and other transfer programs have led to a "decline in U.S. saving."<sup>26</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two other economists also concluded that Social Security reduces savings because workers no longer worry as much about retirement.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Econometric results, according to a study published in the <I>Journal of Public Economics</I>, "suggest that dividend taxes have important effects on investment decisions" and that "an increase of 10 percent in the stock market would raise the investment rate by about 15 percent."<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Writing in the <I>National Tax Journal</I>, three economists found "significant effects for the after-tax return on saving, after-tax cost of borrowing, or both."  The Reagan tax cuts "had a major impact on U.S. economic growth."<sup>29</sup>

<center><b>APPENDIX 3:<br> Growth Is Weaker When Government Penalizes Economic Behavior</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A 1983 World Bank study of 20 countries found that low-tax nations experience faster growth, generate more investment, and enjoy more rapid increases in productivity and standards of living than high-tax nations.<sup>30</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The tax system imposes between 22 cents and 54 cents of losses for every dollar raised, according to a labor-supply economist. For working wives, the losses are even higher: more than 58 cents for very dollar of tax revenue.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another study found that each 1.0 percent increase in the federal tax burden reduces economic growth by 1.8 percent and lowers national employment by 1.14 percent.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to a statistical study published in the <I>American Economic Review</I>, for every dollar paid to the federal government in taxes, 33.2 cents is lost to the economy.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The increased tax burden between 1965 and 1980 drove an estimated 1.9 million people out of the U.S. labor force.<sup>34</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Statistical research published in <I>Lloyd's Bank Review</I> has found that in the U.K. each one percent rise in payroll taxes causes hiring to fall by approximately 1.4 percent. The same study estimated that each $1 of additional tax revenue costs $3 in lost economic output.<sup>35</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A study printed in the <I>American Sociological Review</I> concluded that "Increases of one percent in the tax burden relative to household income are directly associated with a 2.8 percent decline in economic growth over three years, or just under one percent annually."<sup>36</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	An <I>American Economic Review</I> study found that every dollar of taxes could impose as much as $4 of lost output on the economy, with the probable harm ranging between $1.32 and $1.47.<sup>37</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A 1981 analysis of the Swedish economy in the <I>Journal of Political Economy</I> found "The estimated long-run effects [of high marginal tax rates] are sufficient to explain up to 75 percent of the recent decline in the measured growth of the Swedish GNP."<sup>38</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to a former Treasury Department official, between 75 percent and 80 percent of the additional wealth generated by increased savings and investment goes to workers.<sup>39</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another study in the <I>Journal of Political Economy</I> estimated that the corporate income tax costs more in lost output than it raises for the government. The "excess burden" is "123 percent of revenue."<sup>40</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A 1984 study in the <I>American Economic Review</I> estimated "20.7 cents of welfare loss per additional dollar of tax revenue."<sup>41</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A study of U.S. taxes at the state level found that low-tax states grew 35 percent faster than high-tax states between 1970 and 1980.<sup>42</sup>  The relationship between growth and taxes among the states has been shown in literally dozens of studies.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another economist was able to illustrate a very strong inverse relation between average per capita growth rates and average tax rates on income and profits in developed countries.<sup>44</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to an article in the <I>Journal of Political Economy</I>, based on worldwide data, increasing the tax burden by ten percentage points will reduce annual growth by two percentage points.<sup>45</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In a paper presented at the World Bank, two economists uncovered an "impressive negative relation between the rate of growth and the ratio of tax revenue to GDP" as well as a "negative association between growth and... the 'marginal' income tax rate."<sup>46</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of the explosive growth of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea, Hoover economist Alvin Rabushka has written that 
<blockquote>
	The four Asian tigers adopted supply-side tax policies decades before the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions. Finance ministers oversaw systems of taxation that featured low rates and/or low levels of direct taxation of individuals and businesses, the absence of or very light charges on capital income (interest, dividends, capital gains), and a smorgasbord of inducements for domestic and foreign enterprises to invest and reinvest in each economy.<sup>47</sup>

<h3>OFF WITH THE LIMITS: WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT MONEY AND POLITICS WHEN I RAN FOR PRESIDENT</h3>
<p>
<b>By Lamar Alexander</b>
<br>May 23, 1996.

<P>

On March 3, one day after the disastrous -- for me -- South Carolina primary and three days before I withdrew from the presidential race, I attended Sunday services at the Peachtree Presbyterian Church in Atlanta. The Rev. Frank Harrington preached about how Joshua, after a great victory at the Battle of Jericho, had been surprised and humiliated in the battle of A'i -- so humiliated that Joshua renamed A'i the "Valley of Calamity." He wanted his warriors always to remember the lessons of what had happened there.
<p>
Walking out after the service, I asked Rev. Harrington, "Was the point that I should rename South Carolina the `Valley of Calamity?'" 
<p>
"No," he said, "the point is, you must learn lessons from your defeat -- and then pick yourself up and go on." 
<p>
The voters, in their wisdom, have given me a defeat, and now several weeks to reflect upon its lessons. The Heritage Foundation has invited me today to talk about one of those lessons: the influence of money on the race for the presidency. While my wounds are fresh, here is my view: The so-called campaign reformers are selling the American people a real bill of goods on this one. They are saying that limits on what individuals can give to presidential campaigns and on what candidates can spend will reduce the influence of money and create a better democracy.
<p>
In fact, such limits do precisely the reverse. We now have 22 years of experience with them. Limits have increased the influence of money and are dangerous to democracy. It is the law of unintended consequences operating in all of its glory. Instead of adding more limits, we should take the limits off and rely on full disclosure to discourage corruption.
<p>
The limits on giving and spending for a presidential campaign were well-intentioned, placed into federal law after Watergate. Corporations can't give at all; political action committees may give up to $5,000; and individuals may give up to $1,000 during the primaries (the government pays for the general election). In addition, there are limits on what a candidate may spend in each state primary and a ceiling on spending for the entire primary. The Federal Election Commission enforces all of this.
<p>
The limits were designed to make things better for you, the average voter, so let's look at what they have done. As a result of these limits: 
<ul>
<p><li>You are more likely to see a comet than meet a presidential candidate, unless you have $1,000 -- or live in Iowa or New Hampshire; 

<p><li>You have fewer choices of candidates;

<p><li>The primary campaigns start before you care and end before you have a chance to vote;

<p><li>You are less likely to hear the candidates' messages; 

<p><li>Your nominee is more likely to be someone already holding office, rather than an insurgent;

<p><li>More of your choices are among candidates who are rich enough to spend their own money; and 

<p><li>Washington, D.C., has more to say about who the nominee is and you have less.
</ul><p>
In short, the federal limits on giving and spending during elections are turning presidential races into playgrounds for the rich, the already famous, and the Washington-based, and are helping to deprive most Americans of the opportunity to cast a meaningful vote.
<p>
When we create a system for picking Presidents, I believe our objectives should be these:
<ul>
<p><li>We should want the largest number of good candidates.

<p><li>We should want a good opportunity to hear what they have to say.

<p><li>All of us, if possible, want the opportunity to cast a meaningful vote.
</ul><p>
If this is also your set of objectives, then here is my remedy: Off with the limits. Off with the limits on individual contributions. Off with the spending limits. Require maximum disclosure. Open up the system. Let the candidates speak. Let us vote.
<p>


<b>Three Disclaimers</b>
<p>
Before you think it, let me say it:
<p>
First, I am not here to wallow in gloom. In fact, I come away from the campaign more optimistic, not less. I would do it again in a minute. I believe even more that there is very little wrong with our country that more jobs, better schools, and stronger families won't fix. 
<p>
Second, I believe I can make these remarks in the spirit of a gracious loser. That is made easier because our process produced a nominee whom I respect, who is my friend, and who I will be proud to call my President. Under any process, Bob Dole was our party's most likely nominee this year. (I will confess that my determination to be a gracious loser is tested about once a week when I remember what another defeated Tennessean, Davy Crockett, once said. Congressman Crockett strode to the courthouse steps, faced the voters who had just turned him out of office, and said what every defeated candidate has always wanted to say to such voters: "I'm going to Texas and you can go to hell!")
<p>
Finally, I am not here to complain because Steve Forbes spent $33 million of his own wealth on his presidential campaign. I believe the First Amendment to our Constitution gives Mr. Forbes the right to spend his money to advance his views. The Rockefellers and Perots and Forbeses and du Ponts all have made valuable contributions to our public life. I hope they continue to do so. What I object to, as I will discuss, is letting them spend all they want and then putting limits on the rest of us.
What I am arguing -- that it is wrong to put limits on giving and spending -- runs smack in the face of what we have been hearing ever since Watergate. So let me take my points one by one. What I have to contribute is a view from the inside. I will stick to my impressions and stories from the road and let scholars here at Heritage and elsewhere compile the statistics and perform the analysis.
<p>
<b>Because of the limits, you're more likely to see a comet than meet a presidential candidate, unless you have $1,000 -- or live in Iowa and New Hampshire.</b> 
<p>Of course, not everybody wants to meet a presidential candidate. Walking across New Hampshire, I met a woman taking a work break outside a shoe factory in Manchester. I stuck out my hand and said, "I'm Lamar Alexander. I'd like to be your next President." She looked at me, and at my red and black shirt, and said with disgust, "That's all we need. Another President!" Congressman Mo Udall used to tell about walking into a barber shop. "I'm Mo Udall, running for President," he said. "Yeah, I know," the barber replied. "We were just laughing about that yesterday."
<p>

But if you are one of those persons who would actually like to meet and size up someone who might be your President, get your wallet ready because the $1,000 limit on giving forces candidates to spend most of their time with people who can give $1,000. As with many federal laws, these limits have done just exactly the opposite of what they were intended to do. Limits have increased the influence of money on the candidates.
<p>

For example, to raise $10 million in 1995 for the Alexander for President campaign, I traveled to 250 fund-raising events. Now, think about this. This is about one event per campaign day. This took 70 percent of all my time. As a result, I became unusually well acquainted with a great many good Americans capable of giving $1,000 (who probably represent a cross section of about one percent of all the people in the country). Wouldn't I have been a better candidate, and the country better off had I been elected, if I had spent more time traveling around America and visiting allies abroad? (I actually did this during 1994, driving 8,800 miles across America and spending two months overseas. This was when I was not spending most of my time meeting nice people who could give me $1,000.)
<p>

<b>Because of the limits, you have fewer choices for President.</b><p>
This is because, in the real world, a $1,000 limit on gifts makes fund-raising so difficult that it discourages most candidates. I will now wave my own red flag: It is important not to get carried away with this argument. The difficulty of raising money is sometimes just an excuse. There are other more compelling reasons not to run for President. 
<p>
For example, I recall in November of 1995, when Colin Powell was on the cover of the news magazines and his approval rating in the polls was, literally, higher than the Pope's -- and I was struggling to secure a paragraph in the Keokuk, Iowa, daily -- I was driving to the airport after a New York fund-raiser with a former associate of General Powell's. The unavoidable question arose, "Will Colin run?" The former associate answered, "I don't know. But I can tell you two things about General Powell. One is, he makes rational decisions. Two is, he doesn't like uncertainty." I knew from that moment that, if that were true, there was no chance whatsoever Colin would be a candidate. Running for President is not a rational decision. It is instinctive. It is a passion with a purpose. And it is most surely a symphony in uncertainty. That is why I am so surprised that so many have such a hard time taking Colin Powell at his word, that he simply doesn't want to do it. Most people don't. They don't want the job, or they are afraid they can't win, or more and more they are unwilling to expose themselves and their families to the scrutiny that comes with the candidacy. 
<p>
Having said all of that, it is still true that the prospect of trying to raise $20 million from contributions of $1,000 or less makes the race much less attractive and often impossible for many good candidates. In 1995, Bill Bennett told me he didn't know how to raise that kind of money. Jack Kemp said he knew how but didn't want to. Dan Quayle and Dick Cheney discovered it would have been very hard even for a former Vice President and a former Defense Secretary; they both decided not to become candidates. 
<p>
You might have wondered this year, where have all the governors gone? I don't think I have ever met a governor who didn't think he or she would make an excellent President. Seventeen of our Presidents have been governors. There are today 32 Republican governors. One might argue (and I will confess that I tried out this argument a few hundred times during 1995) that the natural presidential partner for our strong Republican congressional leaders would have been the best of our Republican governors. 
<p>
But at the end of 1995, not one sitting Republican governor was in the race. Carroll Campbell, Tommy Thompson, and Bill Weld, perhaps others, had considered it and drawn back, privately saying, "I can't raise the money." Even the governor of California, Pete Wilson -- who by my calculation is governor of five percent of all the money in the world -- could not raise enough money. So, for Republicans, 1995 turned out to be the year of the "money primary." 
<p>
This is how it worked. There were, in the end, only four of us who could find a way to raise enough money to run for President. We all had certain advantages. For example, a contribution to Bob Dole was also a contribution to the respected Senate majority leader. Phil Gramm had worked relentlessly for six years as chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee to build a list of 83,000 names and a $5 million campaign kitty, which he then transferred to his presidential account -- a perfectly legal loophole, but one which was unavailable to the governors or others not holding office. Pat Buchanan was able to depend on direct mail for smaller contributions because it was his second race, he had been on network television for 15 years, and he took, shall we say, especially noisy positions. 
<p>
The Alexander campaign had some advantages, too: exceptional national leadership and strong support at home. Six of the last seven Republican national finance chairs chaired our fund-raising. We began with a $2 million dinner in Nashville on March 6, 1995, and raised $5.2 million in 21 events during the next six weeks. At the end of 1995, the three zip codes in America which had contributed the most to presidential campaigns were all in Nashville. By the time I withdrew, we had raised nearly $13 million from 26,000 contributors, 8,800 of whom had given $1,000. (We received another $4 million from federal matching funds.) 
<p>

But after the initial $5.2 million spurt, it became much harder for us. I was traveling to 20 events per month to raise $500,000. This created logistical adventures of Desert Storm proportions. On one day, I flew from Nashville to Colorado Springs to Denver for fund-raisers and then on to Phoenix to be ready for an early morning breakfast. To collect $20,000 during the crucial week before the Iowa caucus, I "dropped by" Knoxville, Tennessee, on the way from New Hampshire to Iowa. To raise another $30,000, I flew from Sioux City, Iowa, to San Juan, Puerto Rico, one Sunday in December. By the last four days of the New Hampshire primary, we were running on empty except for the money set aside for debts, audit, and winding down.
<p>

Then, when I placed a strong third in the Iowa caucus on February 12, the money dam broke. Beginning three days after Iowa, five days before the New Hampshire primary, contributions started rolling in to our Nashville headquarters at the rate of $100,000 a day without events. This continued for every day except Sunday, until I withdrew on March 6. Our once-a-week telephone conference calls sometimes included more than 200 volunteer fund-raisers. But it came too late, for New Hampshire ads had to be purchased the Friday before the primary on Tuesday. I failed (by 7,000 votes) to overtake Senator Dole. The Republican nomination was decided in the first primary. 
<p>

<b>Partly because of the limits, the campaign starts before you care and ends before you have a chance to vote.</b> 
<p>
Not only did the campaign end early; it started ridiculously early because, it seemed at the time, starting early was the only way to raise the necessary amount of money. In early 1995, Senator Gramm of Texas, flush with his 83,000 names and $5 million kitty, declared that it would take $20 million to run for President, that he could raise it and that he doubted many others could, and then sponsored a $4 million kick-off dinner in Dallas and announced, "Ready cash is a candidate's best friend." 
<p>

 None of the rest of us were about to be left behind. I held my $2 million dinner in Nashville. Senator Dole jumped in, as did others. Off we went, pounding the streets in 1995 trying to raise money for a race in 1996. It was like trying to stir up a conversation about football in the middle of the NBA playoffs. For me, by mid-summer 1995, it was going something like this interview: 
<blockquote><p>
	From Washington, D.C., "Inside Politics," Wolf Blitzer (already bored with the long "money primary"): "Governor Alexander, why do the polls show Senator Dole ahead of you 54 to 4 in Iowa?" 
<p>
	From Vermont, in my red and black shirt, Me (already tired of being asked the same question for the 50th time): "Wolf, that's the dumbest question I've ever heard. The reason Senator Dole is ahead of me is that everyone knows him and nobody knows me." 
</blockquote>
<p>
Now, add to the cost of creating such a long campaign the usual costs of fund-raising. A rule of thumb is that it costs 30 cents to raise a dollar. That meant that of the $10 million we raised in 1995, about $3.5 million went for fund-raising. Then there is the cost of complying with federal regulations. Another $1 million of the $10 million we raised during 1995 went for that. We set aside still another $500,000 for the campaign audit, which usually takes years. I think you can see where I am heading. 
<p>
 Add the costs of the long campaign to the usual costs of fund-raising and complying with federal rules and, by the time the 1995 money primary was over and the real primary in 1996 was here, the handful of us still standing (except for Mr. Forbes) were running out of money. The Alexander campaign spent $10 million during 1995, everything we raised, which left us about $3 million in the bank (counting federal matching funds) at the beginning of 1996. And, by comparison, we were running a bare-bones effort. Senator Gramm had spent $28 million when he dropped out just before the first primary in mid-February. Senator Dole had spent more than $30 million by March 1 and, with 39 primaries yet to go, was coming uncomfortably close to the federally imposed primary spending ceiling. Steve Forbes spent $33 million before he dropped out. I'm not sure whether my friend Pat has dropped out yet or not! 
<p>
 The reason why the Republican nomination was decided in the first primary is not only because limits on giving and spending forced the campaigns to start early. It is also because so many states moved their primaries to an earlier date in an attempt to give their citizens the same privilege Iowa and New Hampshire citizens have: the opportunity to cast a meaningful vote to pick the first President of the new century. This bunching of primaries created a wild roller coaster ride through 38 states in the 25 days after New Hampshire. Ironically, this made New Hampshire even more important. Here was the law of unintended consequences mischievously at work once again. The money primary became so long and expensive that we all arrived financially exhausted at the real starting line: New Hampshire, which turned out to be the finish line as well. About the time the voters had returned from the refrigerator to settle in and watch the presidential campaign unfold and perhaps even to vote in it the campaign had ended. 
<p>

<b>Because of the limits, you are less likely to hear the candidates' message.</b>
<p>

This is because limits on giving and spending prevent most candidates from raising enough money to get across their messages, especially if the candidate is relatively unknown at the beginning. Let me offer an example. Yesterday's <I>Newsweek</I> contains a column by Meg Greenfield which says this: "The doomed Presidential campaign of Lamar Alexander should tell the Republicans something. It was the quintessential anti-government pitch -- complete with an implicit -- and often explicit -- denial and disavowal of Alexander's career as a government guy. He bombed." 
<p>

 Well, now, this is the stuff of a pretty good debate. Of course, I disagree with Ms. Greenfield. I think my campaign nearly succeeded because I understand that the next President must lead us to expect less from Washington and ask more of ourselves, including our local governmental institutions. Ms. Greenfield's and President Clinton's solution is more from Washington. So let the debate begin. 
<p>

 Ms. Greenfield has her page in <I>Newsweek</I>. She is also editorial director for the <I>Washington Post.</I> President Clinton has the best forum of all. Their "more from Washington" side of the argument will get plenty of exposure. But what about my "more from us" argument? I made my case in Iowa during 80 visits and walked 100 miles across New Hampshire. I found that in those small meetings I could be persuasive. I also found that nothing much happened in the public opinion polls until I was on television. "Free TV" -- the network news -- was not of much help (although some local stations were very aggressive). To begin with, the national networks didn't arrive until mid-January when the campaign was nearly over. 
<p>

 The Center for Media and Public Affairs watched all the network newscasts in January and February, ten-and-one-half hours of campaign coverage. The Center found that we nine Republican candidates were allotted 79 minutes total. We were allowed to present our views in seven-second sound bites. The journalists covering us received five times as many minutes of coverage on those same newscasts. What the journalists said about us and our campaigns was more negative than what we candidates said about each other. And more than half the journalists' comments were about the horse race, not the issues. The Freedom Forum, in a remarkable survey of the journalists covering the presidential campaign, found that in 1992, 89 percent had voted for Bill Clinton. A candidate cannot rely on "Free TV" to get his message across. That is why, in our media-drenched society, where things are not important unless they are on TV, a candidate must have money for television to get a message across, and the limits on giving and spending make it difficult for candidates to do that.
<p>

This is not just one candidate's lament. Limits on giving and spending are an affront to the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The whole idea of the framers of the Bill of Rights was to keep the government from attempting to limit political debate and criticism: "Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech." In <I>Buckley v. Valeo</I>, the Supreme Court acknowledged this and struck down most congressional limits of this sort, but left standing the current provisions because of its worry about "corruption." I believe the better antidote to corruption is disclosure. To correct something bad, we have created something worse. 
<p>
<b>
Because of limits, your nominee is more likely to be an incumbent than an insurgent.
</b><p>
In the real world, insurgents not only need more money than incumbents; they need it early. The <I>New York Times</I> reported that two-thirds of voters in New Hampshire made their minds up during the last week before the primary, after the Iowa caucuses. Among those voters, I won with 31 percent. Among the one-third who voted before Iowa, I received six percent. More money, earlier, might have helped get my message across to those early deciders. 
<p>

Candidates for President who already hold public office have government-paid staffs of policy advisers, PR people, and political administrators. They have name recognition and franking privileges. They have a fund-raising advantage because of their positions of power. If they are in Washington, they have a huge media advantage because that is where the media are. So putting a limit on what all candidates can raise and spend turns out to be a protection policy for some candidates: the ones who already enjoy the perquisites of public office. 
<p>

This is not just true in federal races. My home state, Tennessee, has just limited contributions to governors' races to $500. This is an enormous advantage for our incumbent Republican governor, Don Sundquist. And it virtually guarantees that the only effective candidate against Governor Sundquist when he runs for re-election will be someone who is so rich that he can spend his or her own money -- which brings us to the most important point. 
<p>

<b>Because of the limits, more of your choices are likely to be rich candidates willing to spend their own money.</b><p>

This brings us to the major problem with limits on campaign giving and spending: The limits apply to some candidates but not to others. This is because the U.S. Supreme Court has said that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits Congress from preventing anyone from spending his or her own money on our own campaigns. So the limits apply only to people who aren't rich enough to spend money on their own campaign. 
<p>

This creates an absurd advantage for wealthy candidates and a distorted contest for the voter. The first advantage is the obvious: The wealthy candidate has more money to spend. For example, Mr. Forbes spent $33 million of (mostly) his own money; I spent, with matching funds, about $16 million of other peoples' money. 
<p>

There are two other less obvious advantages. The candidate with his own money spends no time raising it. On the other hand, the candidate raising it is careening from event to event, repeating speeches, meeting nice people who can give $1,000, wearing himself ragged, and using up 70 percent of his time. By the time you reach the finals the week between Iowa and New Hampshire, you are a candidate for a fitness center, not the presidency. 
<p>

Finally, there are the state-by-state spending limits, which also help the rich. The federal government has decreed, for example, that a campaign may not spend more than $1 million in Iowa and $618,000 in New Hampshire during the presidential primaries. Mr. Forbes, unaffected by these limits, spent $5 million in Iowa on television. The Alexander campaign spent $930,000. The AP reported that on the third week before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Forbes bought 700 ads on one Boston television station (which covers southern New Hampshire). That week, Senator Dole bought 200 ads on that station. The Alexander campaign: none. Mr. Forbes must have spent $5 million in Arizona, by my estimates. Local newspapers said it was more than any advertiser had ever spent on local television to introduce a new product. (It must be pointed out that having your own money doesn't automatically mean you win. Mr. Perot is not President. Mr. Forbes came in fourth in both Iowa and New Hampshire. I recall my race for governor in 1978 against a candidate who must have spent $8 million. I spent $2 million, enough to win, although I could never have raised $2 million if there had been limits of $500 or $1,000 per contribution.)
<p>

What kind of contest is this, having different rules for different contestants? This is like watching the Magic play the Bulls with one team wearing handcuffs. It is certainly not the game the voters paid to see. Think of it this way: Say the fifth grade teacher organizes a contest for class president with water pistols as the weapon of choice; then some kid arrives with a garden hose. Either take away the new kid's garden hose (Bill Bradley suggests a constitutional amendment to limit what individuals can spend on their own campaigns) or give the rest of the fifth graders the freedom to raise and spend enough money to buy their own garden hoses. And if the New Hampshire primary is most of the ball game in presidential primaries, why should state-by-state spending limits keep candidates from defending themselves, even if they use up all their money?
<p>

<b>Because of the limits, Washington has more to say about who the nominee is and you have less.</b> 
<p>
Talking about Washington these days has gotten to be a sticky business. The rest of the country is tired of Washington, and Washington is tired of hearing about Washington. The rest of the country is becoming more offensive about its feelings, and Washington is becoming more defensive. "Cut their pay and send them home" still makes sense in Sioux City, but they call it nonsense here. One of Washington's most senior journalists told me sadly last year that "This town has grown too big for its britches." I have been coming and going from Washington off and on for 30 years and I believe that is true as well; but to come from outside Washington and say it, and to really believe it, is asking for trouble.
<p>

I believe our President must lead us to expect less from Washington and to ask more of ourselves. That is a message less frequently heard in Washington and more difficult to launch from outside Washington. For one thing, this is a media-drenched society, and the message-launchers -- the media -- are increasingly concentrated here. That will be more true in 2000 and 2004 than it was in 1996. The party fund-raising apparatus is here. The party leadership is here. The think tanks, if you will excuse me, are here. To receive maximum attention to my speech today, I am here. There are all sorts of good people here in Washington, but we of necessity, when we are here, talk mostly with each other.
<p>

<b>Reforming the Process</b><p>

Limits on giving and spending make it less likely that a candidate based outside Washington can succeed. Such candidates, by their experience and skills, may be able to help make Washington more like the rest of America, rather than the rest of America more like Washington. I believe Washington will always be a better place if it is constantly refreshed by the strength of the country outside Washington. The way we pick Presidents today makes that more difficult. Limits are not all that is wrong.

<p><b>The process should be deregulated.</b> We should sunset the existing regulations and start over. Fewer rules and full disclosure should be the byword.

<p><b>Spread out the primaries.</b> Let Iowa and New Hampshire go first, in February or March, and then arrange all the other primaries on the second Tuesday of the next three months. This would give winners a chance to capitalize on success, voters a chance to digest new faces, and candidates a chance to actually meet voters. 

<p><b>The candidates should be given the opportunity to speak on television more often for themselves.</b> My even mentioning this runs the same risks Dennis Rodman would take if he suggested some rule changes to a convention of NBA officials. So let me begin with some praise. Some print reporters sat through New Hampshire Lincoln Day dinners in the early stages of the money primary, in 1994 and 1995. C-SPAN and CNN labored valiantly and early. In January and February of 1996, the <I>New York Times</I> began printing some long excerpts of the candidates' speeches, and the networks began showing unedited stump speeches. But most of the coverage came late, or was about the horse race, or about candidates who were never going to run. Seventy-nine minutes of network exposure in seven-second sound bites for nine Republican candidates is pathetically little. 
<p><b>
There are dangers to early voting.</b> In a growing number of states, voters may vote a month or two before the election day. According to the Edison exit poll of 1996 New Hampshire primary voters, 40 percent of the voters made their minds up during the last three days before the primary. Those who cast their votes a month earlier were voting in quite a different race. 

<p>
 <b>Other Options For Reform</b>
<p>
The first option is suggested by Senator Bill Bradley, whose sporting background must make him especially allergic to contests with one rule for some participants and another rule for others. Senator Bradley would try to create a level playing field by putting limits on everyone, in effect making Mr. Forbes live by the same rules I do. 
<p>
This takes care of Mr. Forbes and me. But the AFL-CIO will still be able to run $35 million worth of TV ads attacking particular Republican candidates. The National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors will still be able to run ads slamming President Clinton's product liability veto. The National Restaurant Association will advertise that President Clinton is wrong about the minimum wage. The National Education Association will say I am wrong about school choice.The national political parties will raise tens of millions in "soft money." The President is the one person in America who is able to advocate the best interests of the country as a whole. Why should we limit the speech only of those who seek to speak for the country as a whole?
<p>
Senator Bradley should leave the First Amendment alone. The First Amendment is correct. It stands in the way of preventing ill-advised efforts by the government to limit a candidate's right to speak. And if there cannot be limits on most of us, why should there be limits on any of us? 
<p>
A second option is public financing which we now have with the presidential general elections. But such taxpayer-funded campaigns still leave Mr. Perot and the AFL-CIO and other committees free to spend millions creating an unlevel playing field. Also, public financing leaves the media with more horsepower than the candidates themselves have. And I cannot fathom how public financing would work in a primary situation. Would the government have funded everyone who showed up at the Republican debates this season? If so, such funding would have produced countless more candidates. I am opposed to public financing. It is incestuous. It is an unnecessary use of taxpayers' money. It invites government regulations. It creates an unlevel playing field by favoring incumbents. 
<p>
Finally, there are various proposals to require the media to give away TV time. (Such proposals would never work in a primary for the same reasons public financing could not work: How would you choose to whom to give it?) The lack of an opportunity for voters to consider the messages of candidates -- especially insurgent candidates -- is at the heart of the problem with our presidential process. But I am afraid these well-meaning proposals will drown in their own complexity and the law of unintended consequences will somehow rear its head again. Isn't the best solution for the media simply to cover the races and present the serious candidates on network news and in the newspapers more often on appropriate occasions, speaking for themselves?
<p>

<b>Find the Good and Praise It</b><p> 
I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks that I came away from the campaign with a good feeling, not a bad feeling. My friend Alex Haley used to say, "Find the good and praise it," and I can easily do that about this process, even with its flaws. During the last year, I walked across New Hampshire, meeting several hundred people a day, spent 80 days in Iowa in maybe 200 meetings that ranged from 20 to 300 people, and had at least 50 meetings in Florida with the delegates to the Presidency III straw poll. During most of these meetings I was little known and unencumbered by the news media, so there was no disruption to the flow of the session. 
<p>
I remember wishing time after time that anybody who had any sense of cynicism about our presidential selection process could be with me, like a fly on the wall, because they could not be cynical after hearing and seeing and feeling what I saw. The groups with whom I met always listened carefully. Most often, they wanted to talk about our jobs, our schools and our neighborhoods, and our families. In meeting after meeting, I came away certain that this is a nation hungry for a vision contest, not one willing to tolerate a trivial presidential election. I believe there is a great market in the American electorate for a full-fledged discussion about what kind of country we can have in the year 2000 and beyond. 
<p>
As the song says, it is a long, long time from May 'til September when the presidential race really begins. One way to help fill this time usefully would be to review the way we pick Presidents and make certain that next time, in the new century, we have a process that attracts the largest number of good candidates, that gives them an opportunity to say and us to hear their messages, and gives as many of us as possible a chance to cast a meaningful vote. 
<p>
One lesson I learned when I ran for President is that step one toward those objectives would be these four words: Off with the limits.

<h3><center>Dr. Edwin J. Feulner Remarks for Town Hall Launch<br></h3>
<h4>June 29, 1995<br></h4></center>

<p>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><p><b>[Town Hall President Tim Butler introduced Dr. Feulner]</b>

<p>Dr. Feulner:<p>
Thank you, Tim, for that kind introduction and welcome to all of you here today as we write another chapter in the unfolding and never-ending story that is democracy in our great nation.  We are here today to officially launch Town Hall, the first conservative community on the Internet.  Like most communities, it has been created to serve people. To provide an innovative site for political discourse and dialogue; an international electronic center where new ideas and policies can be debated and studied by anyone who is interested.

<p>And Town Hall will use the technology of the Information Age -- the Internet -- to create this community of literally millions of people around the world.

<p>Two hundred years ago, people concerned about the direction of their government and committed to the ideals of freedom and liberty joined together to talk and argue, to dream and debate radical new ideas to make their lives and the lives of their families and communities better.  In that respect, Town Hall will be no different.

<p>But in Thomas Jefferson's time, in the days of John Adams and Ben Franklin, communication was not a simple matter and so through print -- through the power of the written word -- the intellectual underpinnings of a revolution were laid.

<p>Two hundred years ago, the pamphlets of Tom Paine and so many others were the home pages of a network of idealists that became a movement... that became a revolution... that became a nation.

<p>Thomas Jefferson once wrote James Madison that a "little rebellion now and then is a good thing and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical."  In 1994, the winds of political change once again blew across the land.

<p>I am very proud that the Heritage Foundation has been instrumental in creating Town Hall as <i>the</i> conservative meeting place on the Internet, but I am equally proud that, through Town Hall, we will continue to play a part in the Second Great American Revolution that has swept Washington and the halls of Congress like a great whirlwind.  Today, we have with us, the Revolution's two great generals in this extraordinary battle of ideas.

<p>On the Senate front, Bob Dole continues to fight for America's families after a lifetime of commitment to his country. In war and in peace, Bob Dole is and always will be a leader -- a man of action and accomplishment.

<p>On the House front, everything <a href="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/GA06.html">Newt Gingrich</a> does shows how deeply he cares about his country and the hopes and dreams of its people.  He is a man of endless ideas whose extraordinary leadership has literally changed the course of history.

 <p>We stand here in the shadow of the Capitol -- at one end of a long continuum -- a continuum that began with the goosefeather pen of Thomas Paine and reaches across time to the computers that sit here on this stage.  I can't think of anyone better to launch this historic connection than these two men -- leading the charge to preserve the Founding Fathers' great legacy of freedom.  Please join me in welcoming Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole and Speaker of the House -- Newt Gingrich.


<p>Thank you both for joining us.  We are all honored to have you here.  Before I ask you to take a seat at the controls, I want to bring out another special guest we are privileged to have with us today.  Just to make sure that the Founding Fathers would have approved, we've been able to conjure up someone who ought to know.  Please welcome the father of inventions, the Honorable Benjamin Franklin.


<p>Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker will you each take a seat at the keyboard?


 <p>Mr. Franklin, will you do the honors?

<p>[Ben Franklin: <i>Let it be known that on this, the 29th day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and ninety-five, we open wide the doors of Town Hall in a spirit of experiment and good will; to preserve liberty and prevent tyranny; and to seek change in the principles, opinions, sentiments and affections of the people as we share in the progress of human knowledge.  Gentleman, on a count of three.... one.... two.... three.... start your engines.</i> ]

<p>Feulner: Ladies and gentlemen, Town Hall is officially launched.


<p>Thank you very much, Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker and, of course, Mr. Franklin. Thomas Jefferson would be proud.  It is now my happy duty to introduce you to the charter members of Town Hall -- America's leading conservative organizations whose vision and creativity have spurred them to join this innovative effort.  I am very pleased to welcome them to the Town Hall Community.  As I introduce their representatives, we will all get a look at each group's site as it will appear in Town Hall.
<p>

<ul><p>First, please welcome, David Keene, Chairman of the <a href="/conservative/">American Conservative Union</a>.

<p>Next shades of the Boston tea party, is Grover Norquist, President of <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>.

<p>It is also a great pleasure to welcome the President of <a href="/empower/">Empower America</a> -- Bill Dal Col.

<p>Following Bill is Gary Bauer, President of the <a href="/townhall/FRC/">Family Research Council</a>. Welcome aboard, Gary.

<p>Next, Town Hall is privileged to house <a href="/lead-inst/">The Leadership Institute</a>, headed by Morton Blackwell.

<p>Now, one of our newest additions, Grace-Marie Arnett, Executive Director of the <a href="/taxcom/">National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</a>.

<p>We are also delighted to have with us, <a href="/nmp">National Minority Politics</a> and its distinguished publisher, Willie Richardson.

<p>Following Willie is John O'Sullivan, Editor of <a href="/nationalreview>National Review</a> magazine.

<p>I am also very pleased to introduce the President of the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee</a>, Karen Kerrigan. Come on up, Karen.

<p>Next we are pleased to announce the addition of the <a href="/wash_times/">Washington Times National Weekly Edition</a> to the ranks of Town Hall and its Editor-in-Chief, Wes Pruden.

<p>Finally, I am very proud to welcome, the <a href="/yaf/">Young America's Foundation</a> and its president, Ron Robinson.</ul>

<p>It's a great starting line-up but only the beginning of a fast-growing community. Thank you all for being here today.

<p>I am now very happy to be able to give all of you the opportunity to hear from our two wonderful leaders here today. It is truly an honor for me to first introduce to you the great Speaker of the House of Representatives -- Newt Gingrich.

<p><b>[Gingrich speaks]</b>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for those wonderful words.  It is my great privilege to introduce to you now the outstanding Majority Leader of the United States Senate -- Senator Robert Dole

<p><b>[Dole speaks]</b>

<p>We are honored that both of you have been with us today. Thank you for that great vote of confidence and thanks to all of you for coming today.

<p>You, too, are now a part of history but this historic day isn't over. As you see, we have terminals set up for any or all of you to try your hand at surfing the Net, and there are Town Hall Net guides available to help you navigate uncharted waters.

<p>Also, this afternoon there will be a lecture series featuring a number of conservative and industry leaders followed by question and answer periods. We hope you'll take advantage of this opportunity to begin the debate. Thanks again for coming, and I hope we'll be talking soon -- at <a href="/townhall/welcome.html.cgi">www.townhall.com</a>.

<h3>AMERICAN MILITARY INTERVENTION: A USER'S GUIDE </h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/hillen.html">John Hillen</a><br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1079<br>
May 2, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Deciding when, where, and how to intervene with military force presents a truly perplexing set of questions. In a post-Cold War world, with no overriding threat to serve as the focus for American national strategy, it is even more difficult to decide when, where, and how to use the U.S.'s limited military resources. In this increasingly uncertain world, it is therefore imperative that American policymakers follow clear guidelines in deciding where and when American military intervention is most needed and how it can be most effective.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, however, the United States currently has no such guidelines in place. Because of this, the Clinton Administration has been tempted to intervene militarily in peripheral areas of the world. In Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia, the result has been either failure or settlements that even one former Clinton advisor has characterized as "provisional, fragile, and reversible."<sup>1</sup>  Moreover, congressional and public support has been very weak because it has been unclear to most Americans how these interventions serve the national interest.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

America will continue to squander its military resources on such inconclusive and tangential operations unless the Clinton Administration and Congress adopt a concrete set of policy guidelines for when and how to use American military forces abroad. These guidelines must be flexible enough to address a wide range of military options, but they also must be constant enough to balance the projected benefit of any intervention against the costs to the American people.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Before approving any future military intervention, the Administration and Congress therefore should make certain that it meets the following criteria:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #1 - Military intervention should defend national security interests.</b> Both the President and Congress must recognize that not all national interests are equally important. They must also acknowledge that not all national interests are national security interests that require military intervention. Instead of focusing on core security interests, the Clinton Administration has committed American military power only on the periphery, and with inconclusive and negligible results. The Administration has what one critic has called an "instinct for the capillary" -- a tendency to send U.S. troops on missions that serve lesser national interests, or in some cases (such as Haiti and Somalia), no security interest at all.<sup>2</sup>  For America to use its power effectively, it must prioritize where and how it chooses to defend its vital, important, and marginal interests, thereby avoiding both excessive activism that diffuses important resources and isolationism that eschews important opportunities to shape events.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #2 - Military intervention should not jeopardize the ability of the U.S. to meet more important security commitments.</b> America's current national military strategy is strategically bankrupt. Not only is the Bottom-Up Review force too small to execute the two major regional conflicts strategy, but it is woefully underfunded as well. Huge interventions in areas of marginal security interest have exacerbated the strain on the U.S. military and made it doubtful that the military can mobilize the resources necessary to defend vital national interests and honor current security commitments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #3 - Military intervention should strive to achieve military goals that are clearly defined, decisive, attainable, and sustainable.</b> Military interventions should be conducted to accomplish clearly definable military goals that are militarily achievable, consistent with overriding political objectives, and supported by enough force to achieve these goals. In Bosnia, the Clinton Administration has failed to define these military objectives clearly, and those objectives that have been articulated are insufficient to achieve the larger political goal of reaching a sustainable peace. Thus, there is no reliable way to measure success or failure, which is why Clinton has imposed a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The President, in effect, has made withdrawing U.S. forces on schedule the only clear-cut, identifiable U.S. military goal in Bosnia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #4 - Military intervention should enjoy congressional and public support. </b> President Clinton has made a habit of circumventing Congress in deciding to undertake military interventions. In non-emergency contingencies like Haiti and Bosnia, Congress should have the opportunity to vote on the merits of an intervention, not merely whether to support American troops already on the ground. Such decisions should not be made by polls; Americans traditionally are reluctant to intervene. However, when intervention is required, the President should mobilize public support (as President Bush did during the Persian Gulf War) so that American troops abroad will know that the nation and the Congress support not only the troops, but the actual goals of the operation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #5 - The armed forces must be allowed to create the conditions for success.</b> The U.S. armed forces must be allowed the operational freedom to create the conditions within which they can succeed. The U.S. military should never be placed in a situation where it has no control over the outcome, as was the case in both Haiti and Bosnia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fortunately, Congress can help redress the policy shortcomings of the Clinton Administration. First, it should ask the President to issue a presidential directive that establishes these five criteria for military interventions. This would add to the Administration's presidential decision directive concerning multilateral peace operations (PDD-25), which was limited to guidelines for U.S. participation in peacekeeping. Congress also should require that the National Security Strategy, an annual report by the President to Congress, contain:
<p><ul>
<li><b>A prioritization</b> of national interests and national security interests;
<p>
<li><b>A listing of criteria,</b> such as those listed here, that will give guidelines for when, where, whether, and how the U.S. military should conduct military interventions;
<P>
<li><b>A set of criteria</b> for deciding when and in what capacity the U.S. will participate in multilateral military operations through coalitions, alliances, and other structures such as the United Nations;<p>

<li><b>An unequivocal guarantee</b> that the President will consult Congress before launching military interventions that are not national emergencies; and
<P>
<li><b>A declaration</b> that U.S. military forces in interventions abroad will have clearly defined, decisive, and attainable military objectives that can be achieved through proven military doctrine.
</ul><P>
<b>THE NEED FOR CRITERIA</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Few issues of foreign and military policy are as vexing for the policymaker as military intervention. The problem of finding reliable criteria for deciding when, where, why, and how to intervene abroad with military force is made particularly difficult by several factors. First, there is the character of the "new world disorder," a volatile and unpredictable international arena that does not lend itself to conceptual or strategic clarity. On the one hand, there is no one clear and present danger on which to base a coherent strategy; on the other hand, the many lesser threats to American interests, like those posed by such rogue states as North Korea, Iran, Iraq, and Libya, cannot be ignored. These threats are more than enough reason for maintaining forces capable of many different levels of military intervention.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second factor that complicates operating in this world disorder is a dilemma in the way Americans think about military intervention. Henry Kissinger has aptly described this dilemma and the solution that is needed:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	America's dominant task is to strike a balance between the twin temptations inherent in its exceptionalism: the notion that America must remedy every wrong and stabilize every dislocation, and the latent instinct to withdraw into itself. Indiscriminate involvement in all the ethnic turmoil and civil wars of the post-Cold War world would drain a crusading America. Yet an America that confines itself to the refinement of its domestic virtues would, in the end, abdicate America's security and prosperity to decisions made by other societies in faraway places and over which America would progressively lose control. Not every evil can be combated by America, even less by America alone. But some monsters need to be, if not slain, at least resisted. What is most needed are criteria for selectivity.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration has failed to put forth such selective criteria for military intervention: when and why it should take place, and how it should be carried out.<sup>4</sup>  Instead of offering a sensible strategy that sets strategic priorities and matches America's means to her most important foreign policy objectives, the Administration has concentrated on marginal "feel-good" operations on the periphery of U.S. national interests. While neglecting the core priorities of American foreign policy, the Administration has squandered American resources on interventions in Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia -- military operations in which the claimed successes are both transient and easily overturned.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Professor Michael Mandelbaum, a former Clinton advisor, writes that President Clinton has intervened on the periphery in "social work" at the expense of successfully managing relations with other great powers -- the core concern of U.S. foreign policy.<sup>5</sup>  Nothing demonstrates the validity of this argument better than the continued insistence of Administration officials that Bosnia is a conflict "raging at the heart of Europe."  Bosnia is indeed a European security problem, but hardly one that threatens to overwhelm the continent. It needs attention, but not the same sort of military attention given by America to Europe as a result of the hegemonic designs of Germany and the Soviet Union in the past. Americans deserve a foreign policy that is shorter on such rhetoric and longer on rational discourse about core and peripheral interests. Such discourse is needed to promote consensus and understanding about where, when, and how America should intervene.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because the United States is the world's leading power, U.S. leaders must shape events and not be shaped by them. In Bosnia, however, President Clinton portrayed American leadership as a fateful burden that has painted America into a corner as the leader of the NATO implementation force (IFOR). Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke has stated that "we did not choose this as the test case.... [N]obody wanted it to happen, but that is the hand history has dealt us. The U.S. role in Europe and NATO's future and our bilateral relationships with all the major countries in Europe are all going to be determined by Bosnia."<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In other words, the U.S. has no control over its own destiny in Bosnia or Europe, and leadership simply means accepting the many bad options presented by European and Administration indecisiveness. In addition, such a statement means surrendering America's right to help shape the future of Europe and instead allowing the American role in Europe to be determined by local factions in Bosnia. This is hardly leadership. America leads because of the conditions leadership engenders, conditions that are favorable to the U.S. and its allies. Leadership is a means to an end, not an end in itself. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By failing to lead and shape events in Bosnia, the U.S. has relegated itself to the role of medium-sized player in a peripheral European security affair. The Administration has put aside the larger questions, such as NATO's expansion, in favor of a one-year peace implementation mission in Bosnia. More important, it has tied the measure of American power and successful foreign policy in the world to insignificant operations that the President claims are "test cases" of American leadership. The danger, as one analyst has noted, is that "it is surely perilous to think of the Balkans as an 'acid test,' 'test case,' or a 'defining moment' for anything. We have already seen what devastating effect such manufactured challenges can have on Western unity."<sup>7</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States needs a military intervention policy that is consistent with America's role as the greatest power in the world today. Such a policy would be based on the need to protect and defend America's national security interests through a range of military options, including deterrence, preventive attacks, warfighting, diplomacy, and even peace operations. An intervention policy should discriminate between America's interests and how best to defend them so that America's limited military resources will be used where they are most needed and most effective and not wasted on inconsequential operations of little lasting significance. 
<p>
<b>THE INTERVENTION DEBATE</b><sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration has acted without an effective doctrine for military intervention. Clinton's national strategy of "Engagement and Enlargement," for example, offers more in the way of academic abstractions than discriminating policy guidance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This reluctance to provide useful criteria for military intervention comes on the heels of long-standing debate. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger was attacked in 1984, from both the left and the right, for proposing criteria that were perceived as too restrictive. Weinberger proposed six conditions for military intervention: 
<ul><p>
<li>Vital national interests are threatened,
<p>
<li>The U.S. clearly intends to win, 
<p>
<li>The intervention has precisely defined political and military objectives,
<p>
<li>There is reasonable assurance that intervention will be supported by the American people and Congress,
<p>
<li>The commitment of American forces and their objectives can be reassessed constantly and adjusted if necessary, and
<P>
<li>The commitment of U.S. forces to combat is undertaken as a last resort.<sup>9</sup> 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Critics maintained that Weinberger's criteria were a prescription for inaction, arguing that America's military options in many cases would not be clear-cut enough to support their application. In addition to the expected attacks from the left, critics ranging from Secretary of State George Shultz to conservative commentators and <I>National Review</I> magazine claimed that the Weinberger criteria were simply unobtainable in many instances in which the U.S. would want to entertain limited military action. Newspaper columnist William Safire echoed the sentiments of many when he wrote that Weinberger would restrict the U.S. to "only the fun wars."<sup>10</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
From the military's point of view, however, the Weinberger doctrine was meant to guarantee that the U.S. would not repeat the strategic mistakes of the Vietnam War and the failed Lebanese intervention of 1982-1983. In both of those cases, there was no clear intention of winning despite the sacrifices being made; there was tenuous public and congressional support; and the military and political objectives were never clearly defined, attainable, or decisive. The Vietnam syndrome was, in essence, the understandable desire on the part of America's military that their sacrifices not be in vain. As the post-Vietnam military sought to rebuild the strategic ethos, one officer wrote that "when it comes to being engaged in any undertaking where political objectives are hazy, public support only tepid, the prospects for a rapid decision remote, and the risk of substantial casualties high, service opinion is unanimous: count us out."<sup>11</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It therefore came as no surprise when General Colin Powell, who had been a young infantry officer in Vietnam, bolstered the Weinberger doctrine while serving as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Powell weighed in with even more explicit guidance as to how military force should be used in interventions.<sup>12</sup>  In particular, he wished to reinvigorate the strategic link: closely matching military goals to political objectives. And, as is well known, he favored using overwhelming force to guarantee that objectives would be reached at minimum cost in American lives. This was very much the philosophy in the Gulf War, where Powell stated that his strategy left nothing to chance; the U.S. military was "not operating in the margin" and would "win decisively."<sup>13</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the resounding victory in the Persian Gulf, critics still openly questioned the utility of the Weinberger-Powell doctrines as guidelines for the use of force, especially in other-than-war military interventions such as peacekeeping. The late Congressman and Defense Secretary Les Aspin and others said that Weinberger-Powell left the policymaker with only two options: all or nothing. Aspin postulated that with the end of the zero-sum game of Cold War superpower rivalry, the U.S. should adopt a more flexible approach to military intervention. Knowing that military power was a blunt instrument, he also hoped that new military technologies (such as precision guided munitions) would help to provide the U.S. with more precise and flexible tools that could be used in limited military interventions without mobilizing public and congressional support or using overwhelming military force.<sup>14</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration's early position on intervention was couched in light of its doctrine of "assertive multilateralism" and addressed only peace operations. The Administration hoped that U.S. military intervention could be conducted mainly through such multilateral institutions as the United Nations. However, the failure of the U.N. mission to Somalia and the shocking deaths of U.S. soldiers in Mogadishu street battles prompted President Clinton's security team to rethink their criteria for participation in U.N. operations. The result was Presidential Decision Directive 25 (PDD-25), a document that set intervention criteria solidly in the tradition of prudence and caution started by Caspar Weinberger. PDD-25, published in May 1994, set out eight criteria for the U.S. to consider when deciding to support a peace operation, six further restrictions for U.S. participation should American troops be involved, and an additional three if there was a strong possibility of combat.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite this note of caution, however, the restrictive criteria of PDD-25 did not prevent the Clinton Administration from undertaking a peace enforcement mission in Haiti; U.N. peacekeeping in Haiti, Rwanda, and Macedonia; and the NATO peace implementation mission in Bosnia. In these interventions, the cautionary criteria of PDD-25 were ignored. Given the controversies over Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia, it was obvious that there was little desire in the Administration to set criteria, let alone to comply with guidelines when they were set. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In March 1996, National Security Advisor Anthony Lake further contributed to the atmosphere of uncertainty in a speech at George Washington University in which he proposed seven broad circumstances that "may call for the use of force or our military forces."<sup>16</sup>  These circumstances included:
<p>
<ol>
<li>To defend against direct attacks on the U.S., its citizens, and its allies;
<p>
<li>To counter aggression;
<p>
<li>To defend key economic interests;
<p>
<li>To preserve, promote, and defend democracy;
<p>
<li>To prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, international crime, and drug trafficking;
<p>
<li>To maintain U.S. reliability; and
<p>
<li>For humanitarian purposes.<sup>17</sup>
</ol><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This was an attempt to answer "why" and "when" the U.S. might conduct a military intervention. However, Lake's list is not specific enough to serve as a useful guideline for military intervention. For instance, stating that the U.S. will use force "to counter aggression" is strategically meaningless. It assumes that aggression everywhere, large or small, may require the use of American military force. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lake's list can hardly be used to provide constructive guidance on "where" and "whether" to intervene. In addition, the question of "how" must be addressed, as it significantly affects all the other questions. Americans need a clearer set of criteria for military interventions -- which, while not necessarily identical to the Weinberger or Powell criteria, nevertheless are well within the tradition which they established. These criteria are:
<P>
<b>Criterion #1<br>
Military intervention should defend national security interests.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The essence of American statecraft today consists of being able to discriminate among competing national interests and then balance these interests against the willingness of the U.S. to defend them. Otherwise, America risks squandering its power by failing to differentiate between vital interests and others that are merely important or marginal. Without strategic priorities, the U.S. will be left rudderless in the post-Cold War era, lurching from one media-generated crisis to another and vacillating between the extremes of mindless interventionism and rigid isolationism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States today has a limited pool of resources to use for military interventions. These resources are manifested in tangible forms (for example, number of troops, carrier battle groups, or fighter wings) or intangible forms (public support, willingness to sacrifice). America must use these resources wisely, only where American action is most needed and most effective. Devising criteria for military intervention requires a methodology to establish priorities among America's interests in the world.<sup>18</sup>  It is not enough to develop a laundry list of national interests and assert that they are all equally important.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
America's national interests vary not only in degree of importance, but also in the types of military interventions necessary to defend them. <b>Vital national interests</b> (a term often used but not universally understood) are interests essential to the continued existence and well-being of America as a free and prosperous nation. They also are national security interests: Threats to vital interests threaten the security of the United States. Therefore, the United States should be willing to go to war to defend these interests, and should consider all manner of military intervention in order to uphold them. In contrast to Weinberger's criteria, military force in defense of vital national interests should not necessarily be used only as a last resort; many times it will be more effective when used as a first resort. Vital national interests include:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Protecting</b> America's territory, borders, and airspace;
<p>
<li><b>Preventing</b> a major power threat to Europe, East Asia, or the Persian Gulf;
<p>
<li><b>Preventing</b> hostile interference by an outside power in the Western Hemisphere;
<p>
<li><b>Ensuring</b> access to foreign trade and resources; and
<p>
<li><b>Protecting</b> Americans, at home and abroad, against threats to their lives and well-being.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Important national interests</b> are those which are less than vital but important enough to warrant major diplomatic, economic, or possibly limited military intervention. This recognizes the need for more flexibility than given by the Weinberger doctrine. In the post-Cold War world, with its lesser but more nebulous threats, the U.S. must be prepared to use limited force in defense of national security interests that are not vital national interests. Important interests are are not always national security interests, however, because not all threats to the security of the U.S. can be addressed through military means. Important national interests include general stability in Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia, as well as promoting more open trade arrangements with Japan and China, promoting democracy and stability in areas such as the former Soviet Union, and combating terrorism and the flow of illegal drugs into America. As a rule, military intervention should be considered as a last resort in defending most of these interests. In most cases, diplomatic and economic efforts will be more effective. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Marginal interests</b> are national interests, but rarely national security interests, and should not be high on the list of priorities that require the commitment of America's military resources. Marginal interests include political stability and economic development in many parts of the developing world, humanitarian concerns, and environmental issues. These interests also should be considered marginal from a military perspective because they tend to involve the sorts of problems that do not lend themselves to military solutions, especially when imposed by an outside force. For instance, the attempts by U.S. and U.N. military forces at coercive disarmament, political reconciliation, and nation-building in Somalia backfired. Problems of economic and political development, humanitarian crises, and environmental concerns only rarely are susceptible to a military solution. Lasting solutions to these problems most often come from within and are best supported by diplomatic or economic programs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While policymakers must always weigh other considerations, such as moral and legal factors, calculations of national interest must always be their principal focus in setting priorities for military intervention. Moral considerations, media pressure, and legal prerogatives do not always give policymakers a clear sense of the value of a national interest to America and what Americans will be ready to sacrifice for that interest. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For instance, moral outrage and disturbing media images fueled President Bush's decision to conduct a limited humanitarian relief effort in Somalia. Moral considerations and vague internationalist ideals also drove President Clinton to continue the Somalia operation and expand its goals to include political reconciliation and nation-building. However, these moral motivations never gave either President a sense of what the Somalia effort was worth to the American people. In the end, 18 American soldiers killed on October 3, 1993, turned out to be too much for America. The result was a humiliating withdrawal because of a miscalculation over value and the threshold of national sacrifice. The Somalia episode showed the transient and ephemeral nature of national interests generated by the media or academic abstractions about the new world order. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moral umbrage, media-generated urgency, and offense taken from legal transgressions all combine to add pressure for military intervention. Naturally, the policymaker needs to consider all these factors. However, only calculations of national interest, based on the prosperity and well-being of America and her allies, can measure accurately what the American people will sacrifice to see the intervention through to a conclusion. As former National Security Council official Richard Haass writes, "the ability to sustain an intervention over time, and, more importantly, despite human and financial costs, is linked directly to the perceived importance of the interests at stake."<sup>19</sup>
<p>
<b>Criterion #2<br>
 Military intervention should not jeopardize the ability of the U.S. to meet more important security commitments.  </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. is operating with an enormous gap between its national objectives and its military means to achieve them. The gap between security commitments and actual forces is exacerbated by the fact that even the inadequate force of the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review is underfunded by some $150 billion over the next five years.<sup>20</sup>  In the meantime, while drastically cutting America's armed forces by some 35 percent, the Administration has used what is left for tangential peace operations in Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia: missions where the reward for the U.S.'s military efforts are tenuous, indecisive, and easily reversible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The current national security strategy ostensibly is predicated on fighting and winning two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts (MRCs). While President Clinton maintains that "the forces the Administration fields today are sufficient to defeat aggression in two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts,"<sup>21</sup> most experts disagree.<sup>22</sup>  More damaging is the assessment of the uniformed military, those who actually will have to carry out the Clinton strategy with inadequate resources. General Ronald Fogleman, the Air Force Chief of Staff, has testified before the House National Security Committee that the service chiefs "had made no secret of the fact that we have never had the force structure that was called for... to execute the two-MRC strategy."<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This strategic bankruptcy, exacerbated by military interventions in areas of marginal strategic importance, violates what the great American foreign policy thinker Walter Lippman called "the controlling principle" of strategy: that a nation should keep its goals within its means and should never make commitments without providing the resources necessary to achieve them. For the United States, this means ensuring that the shrinking military forces of the U.S. are trained, ready, and postured to defend the national security interests of the U.S.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The primary mission of the U.S. armed forces should be to fight and win the nation's wars, although this obviously does not mean that war is their only task. In fact, of the over 250 military interventions carried out by the U.S. since 1789, only five have been declared wars.<sup>24</sup> In the post-Cold War world, the U.S. military must be prepared for all manner of military interventions, including limited conventional warfare (Panama 1989 and Desert Storm), punitive airstrikes (Libya 1986 and Iraq 1993), deterrence (Kuwait 1994), shows of force (Persian Gulf 1988 and Philippines 1989), and support for peace operations (when their goals are clearly defined and they serve the national interest). However, two critical points must instruct the wide range of possible interventions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first is common sense: Forces intervening somewhere are not available elsewhere. Nor are they training. Congressman Ike Skelton (D-MO) has noted that "peace-keeping commitments may so degrade the armed forces' warfighting capability that it will be impossible to carry out the national military strategy."<sup>25</sup>  His findings are supported by the General Accounting Office, which has found that even small combat units returning from peace operations need up to six months of recovery time to train back up to warfighting standards; larger units (such as divisions) need more.<sup>26</sup>  This means that because the Bosnian peace implementation force requires so many resources from the 1st Armored and 3rd Infantry Divisions, the U.S. Army in Europe is unable to meet the Army's standards of warfighting readiness for one to two years. It also means that the shrinking forces of the U.S. are finding it difficult to keep up with their many security commitments.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second point must always underpin American military strategy: Focus on warfighting and keep America's powder dry to protect vital security interests. Lieutenant General Wesley Clark, the Joint Chiefs' strategic planner, knows that the U.S. armed forces may be called upon to conduct many types of limited interventions in defense of less important interests. He notes that "American military power need not, and indeed, must not, be reserved for use only in cases of vital interests."<sup>28</sup>  However, it is equally true that military interventions in support of peripheral interests should never come at the expense of an American military force trained for and capable of protecting vital interests: a perilous situation that many believe the U.S. is rapidly approaching today. As Colin Powell stated shortly before he retired,
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	we can modify our doctrine, we can modify our strategy, we can modify our structure, our equipment, our training, our leadership techniques, everything else to do these other missions, but we never want to do it in such a way that we lose sight of the focus of why you have armed forces -- to fight and win the nation's wars.<sup>29</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The U.S. must act like a great power and use its military forces where the American role is unique and decisive. The U.S. must concentrate its diplomatic, economic, and military efforts on its core interests: relations with other great powers and preventing major conflicts between them. For instance, America's military role in NATO is to prevent the domination of Europe by a hostile power or bloc of powers. This is a role that no other nation in the world can play. Consequently, an America with security commitments all over the world cannot be expected to play the principal military role in every local security crisis that does not threaten the basic security of the European continent.<sup>30</sup>  As Richard Haass has written, "there is little reason for U.S. involvement in peacekeeping, a mission that can be readily undertaken by the forces of many countries."<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<b>Criterion #3<br>
Military intervention should strive to achieve military goals that are clearly defined, decisive, attainable, and sustainable.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Interventions must always be driven by political and military objectives that will define success or failure in an operation. More important, military objectives must support the political objective. In Vietnam, the numerous battlefield victories achieved by American and South Vietnamese forces made little difference to the political outcome of the conflict. In order to correct that incoherence in America's Vietnam strategy, the U.S. military now specifies in campaign plans exactly how military achievements will produce the political success of an operation. This is what the Weinberger doctrine meant by "winning."  For instance, in the Gulf War, the military objective was to expel the Iraqi Army from in and around Kuwait. When the U.S. military accomplished that task on the battlefield, the political objective was also ensured: Kuwait was liberated and its national sovereignty restored.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For military objectives to contribute to the political goal of an intervention, they must be clearly defined, decisive, and attainable. In some American interventions, the military was not given a clearly defined objective whose attainment could be measured. For instance, in Lebanon in 1982-1983, the U.S. Marines in Beirut were asked to "establish a presence."  This objective was ambiguous, indecisive, and unsustainable, and made little contribution to the political goal of stabilizing Beirut and Lebanon. In Somalia, the initial mission to provide humanitarian relief was clearly defined, and the U.S. military was able to measure its success. However, the mission of nation-building could not be supported by unambiguous and conclusive military missions. As a result, the U.N. force never defined the criteria for its success in Somalia, and the military forces were left to hope that an incoherent campaign of partial disarmament and the fact of their presence would make political reconciliation possible. There was no direct connection between military goals and political objectives, only an oblique influence on political events by various military activities. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Working toward clearly defined goals may seem a rather obvious point, but it has been violated consistently by the Clinton Administration. Lacking clear military and political objectives for his military options, Clinton has fallen back on setting deadlines for troop withdrawal as the only objective that is both clearly defined and attainable. In short, Clinton has substituted time-driven objectives for event-driven objectives. This violates the profound military dictum of Clausewitz that "No one starts a war -- or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so -- without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve and how he intends to conduct it."<sup>32</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In contrast, for the Clinton Administration it is enough that an intervention endure for a certain period of time. Bosnia is case in point. The Administration has not given the military an objective the achievement of which would signal the end of the mission and the accomplishment of something important -- an exit strategy. Instead, President Clinton has offered an exit date and stated that the U.S. military effort in Bosnia will last "about a year."  Therefore, U.S. troops will pull out of Bosnia regardless of whether they achieve any other objectives. In other words, the "exit strategy is the mission. That is, the mission is to show up and leave, not to stay until the [unstated] goals are fully achieved."<sup>33</sup>  Some critics have maintained that this lack of strategy is intentional because if a goal is never set, Clinton cannot be accused of not reaching it. Exit dates, in fact, are foolproof; time always marches on. Supporting the realization of the Dayton Peace Accords -- the vaguely stated goal of the mission in Bosnia -- may not be achieved, but the goal of withdrawing U.S. troops can be.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Time-driven interventions are the <I>de facto</I> strategy of this Administration because it cannot find achievable and sustainable military goals in its ill-defined and ambiguous interventions. In his March 1996 address on intervention, Anthony Lake stressed the Administration's emphasis on schedules and deadlines rather than objectives: In Haiti and Bosnia, "for these operations to succeed, tightly tailored military missions and sharp withdrawal deadlines must be the norm."  Lake has been forced to rely on deadlines and timelines because the Administration is intervening in peripheral conflicts that cannot long sustain the support of the American people and their Congress. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the American people thought the Bosnian intervention was really as profoundly critical to the security of Europe as the Administration pretends, the effort would be worth doing for more than "about a year."  The American public has supported U.S. involvement in NATO for 47 years but is skeptical about Bosnia. This inconsistency between rhetoric and commitment illustrates the Administration's failure to measure the real value of marginal national interests. The President's pollsters know that weak public support for inconsequential interventions can be somewhat ameliorated by deadlines, regardless of mission accomplishment. They also know that if the going gets rough, they can pull out the troops and argue that nothing much was lost anyway --precisely because Americans know that no vital interests were at stake.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This is a gross misuse of American military power. When the U.S. military is committed to an intervention, it must be given goals whose success can be measured clearly. If policymakers do not set clearly defined military and political objectives, they will tend to choose, as in Vietnam, plans that are politically controllable over plans that will be militarily and politically successful.<sup>34</sup>  This is the case in Bosnia. The military plan is controllable, but whether it will be successful is out of the military's hands. As a result, there is no guarantee that the year spent in Bosnia will achieve anything of note.<sup>35</sup>  Ultimately, the goal of the U.S. military is to be persuasive in peace and decisive in war. To satisfy both conditions, it needs clearly defined and decisive objectives in all interventions.
<p>
<b>Criterion #4<br>
 Military intervention should enjoy congressional and public support.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The role of Congress in foreign policy and defense today is certainly not what the framers of the U.S. Constitution intended. During the past three years, Congress has been marginalized and unable to vote on the merits of a military intervention. This condition was fostered during the Cold War and exacerbated by the necessity that the President be able to act with secrecy, expediency, and continuity of purpose. However, neither Somalia, nor Haiti, nor Bosnia represented a critical emergency or imminent threat to national security. There was time for debate about ends and means, costs and benefits, and the role of American military force in the world. Congress must reinvigorate its constitutional role by reasserting its decision-making powers concerning military intervention without infringing on the President's ability to act decisively in a crisis. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In both Haiti and Bosnia, President Clinton committed large numbers of U.S. combat forces without the approval of Congress. In fact, in both instances, the President obtained the authorization of the U.N. Security Council before asking the U.S. Congress for its support. In the debate over the Bosnian intervention, by the time Congress was prepared to vote, the vote was no longer about the value and efficacy of the intervention itself. Rather, it was about upholding a President that already had committed American troops and American prestige. Having painted Congress into a corner, the President won the vote to uphold American credibility and support American troops. Even so, the House of Representatives voted 287-141 to condemn the mission while expressing support for the troops. The Senate voted 69-30 to stand by the troops but "not endorse the President's decision [or] the agreement reached in Dayton."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Similarly, in the first months of his Administration, the President expanded the U.S. role in Somalia and pushed the United Nations to take on a more ambitious mandate. Congress never approved this plan, and when 18 U.S. soldiers were killed in Mogadishu on October 3, 1993, Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) led the successful effort to cut off funds for the mission and force a unilateral U.S. withdrawal from Somalia by March 1994. Not having consulted Congress before changing the nature of the Somalia intervention, President Clinton could not gauge the inherent value of the mission to Congress and the American people. Committing U.S. troops and national prestige to interventions when Congress is unsupportive and the national will is not engaged weakens American credibility abroad.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There has always been tension between the Congress and the President over foreign policy, and military intervention in particular. The framers of the Constitution clearly intended both the legislative and executive branches to have a role beyond one branch's rubber-stamping the unilateral actions of the other. The system delineated by the framers was to have Congress declare war (Article I, Section 8) and the President wage war (Article II, Section 2). But since modern convention is for nations to resort to the force of arms without declaring war, this system of checks and balances has broken down. And yet, as Professor Chistopher Layne recently noted, "as the embodiment of the American people's political will, Congress has a legitimate role in deciding whether U.S. troops participate in global military interventions."<sup>36</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American people must be involved in supporting significant military interventions, and this requires the support of Congress as well. If an intervention is not supported by the public, it can collapse after minimum resistance and a few American casualties. This is not to say that Americans are intolerant of casualties incurred in military interventions, but they will not tolerate losses in interventions that do not have clear goals and readily apparent benefits that are worth the cost in blood and treasure. As strategist Harry Summers has written, "casualties per se are not the limiting factor. It is whether those casualties are disproportionate to the value of the mission."<sup>37</sup>  This proposition is supported by a recent sociological study of public opinion during the Lebanon and Somalia interventions. The study showed that public approval of some interventions "is not conditioned by a knee-jerk reaction to casualties. Judging from the responses we have seen to Lebanon and Somalia, it is conditioned rather by the demand that casualties be incurred for some clear and worthy purpose."<sup>38</sup>  If the mission appears to be worthless, the tolerance for casualties will be low. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The decision to undertake a military intervention cannot be made by polling or by having 535 Members of Congress act as national security advisors. Traditionally, the American public and Congress are reluctant to intervene. Presidential leadership can make a significant difference in building a case for intervention, however. President George Bush worked assiduously for months to rally Congress and the public behind Operation Desert Storm. Even then, not a single member of the Democratic leadership in either the House or the Senate voted in favor of the Desert Storm resolution. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress and the American public should be involved in voting on the merits of any American military intervention, and it is the task of the President to seek that consensus. Only when the nation is solidly behind an intervention can the U.S. hope to sustain credible military efforts abroad.
<p>
<b>Criterion #5<br>
 The armed forces must be allowed to create the conditions for success.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should use its military forces for objectives that can be achieved decisively, and that are politically decisive as well. This does not mean saving the U.S. military for just "the big ones," as some critics charge. Limited interventions done properly, such as the 1986 F-111 raid on Tripoli in Libya, can have a decisive effect. However, in limited interventions, there is often the temptation to restrict military requirements because the purpose is to send a political signal. This happened in 1979 when Iran was threatening Saudi Arabia. Embarrassingly, it was revealed that the F-15s which President Carter sent to help defend Saudi Arabia were unarmed. It was an empty political signal that could have been a military disaster. If U.S. combat forces are to be used in any intervention, their operations must be completely consistent with the proven operational doctrine of the United States military. This allows the U.S. armed forces to create and control the conditions for their success, no matter how big or small the tasks and the stakes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Strategy is the art of using military means to achieve political ends. A coherent strategy ensures that the armed forces have objectives that, once attained, contribute directly to the desired political solution. These military objectives must be clearly defined, attainable, decisive, and consistent with military doctrine. In other words, the military should be given goals that it understands, that it can reach through methods for which it is well-trained, and that will make a difference once attained. From a military perspective, the most sought-after strategy would be similar to that used in the Gulf War, in which President Bush formulated "clear-cut and attainable political objectives; and the armed forces achieved those objectives through rapid and decisive military action."<sup>39</sup>  While this formula is not always so easily achieved in limited military interventions, the policymaker should strive to replicate it as much as possible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. military prefers rapid and decisive action because it delivers results. Not only is overwhelming force and decisive action consistent with the greatest success, but it tends to be the least costly way to fight. In any intervention, the military wants to keep the initiative. The actions of U.S. forces, not others, should dictate the pace of events and the outcome. Even in limited interventions, the use of overwhelming force helps American forces keep the initiative and create the conditions for success. It also helps minimize the casualties and costs of protracted or attritional warfare. Although this is often referred to as the "Powell Doctrine," it is in fact a classic tenet of military action. The official history of World War II notes that "the efficient commander does not seek to use just enough means but an excess of means. A military force that is just strong enough to take a position will suffer heavy casualties in doing so; a force vastly superior to the enemy's will do the job without serious loss of men."<sup>40</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Many types of intervention are inherently resistant to this formula. Peacekeeping, for example, relies on the consent and cooperation of the local factions in order to succeed. The peacekeepers themselves cannot guarantee the outcome no matter how efficient their operations. It is for this reason that peacekeeping missions can carry on for 20 years on the Golan Heights, 30 years on Cyprus, or 40 years in India and Pakistan with no conclusion. This also could become the case in Bosnia, where U.S. forces have been deployed to a volatile environment without being able to create the conditions for success. Such interventions should be avoided, since they offer no control over what return can be expected from America's military sacrifices. The U.S. should not be interested in make-work military options in which a "draw" is a good result.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, because the U.S. is the world's military superpower, American forces will be involved in multilateral peacekeeping or other inconclusive interventions. It is imperative that the U.S. play only a supporting role in these indecisive multilateral ventures. The U.S. should promote a sensible division of labor in multilateral operations; America is not just another power. Using U.S. leadership in this way will extend American resources and allow the U.S. to focus on those crises in which the American role can be both unique and decisive. Faced with all manner of security crises, both great and small, the U.S. should function much as the Mayo Clinic does in an unhealthy world: American combat troops should not make a house call for every case of nighttime heartburn, but instead should support local doctors as the need arises. More important, the forces of the U.S. should be committed to those illnesses that are truly consequential and for which the unique and decisive capabilities of the American military are most needed and most effective. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. also must decide when to work under the rubric of an international organization, as part of a coalition of the willing, or on its own. As a rule, if a military intervention is worth doing, it is worth doing alone. However, operating with the support and assistance of allies can offer tremendous political and military advantages. Another factor that must be recognized is the constraints presented by international organizations. An alliance such as NATO has the political legitimacy, military authority, and practiced procedures for mounting and deploying significant military operations; an organization such as the U.N., however, is not capable of forming, directing, and employing large military forces in pursuit of ambitious objectives. It is inhibited by the constraints inherent in a 185-member voluntary organization. The U.N. has neither the legitimacy nor the authority that would allow it the resources and procedures for forming and controlling complex military operations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The more complex a military operation becomes, the more it will require a stringent, rehearsed, and reliable command and control structure that can be provided only by a practiced alliance structure or a coalition dominated by a major power. A coalition of the willing, such as that in the Persian Gulf War, can be a tremendous success as long as there is a clear unity of effort and purpose among coalition partners and a legitimate and authoritative framework for command and control. Any time U.S. combat forces are involved in coalition operations, the United States should work either as the lead nation or in a parallel command and control structure where American troops remain under U.S. command and control. U.S. troops should never be put under non-U.S. command and control structures in order to "balance" coalition forces on paper; they must always have the operational autonomy to succeed through operations based on American training and doctrine.
<p>
<b>CODIFYING A MILITARY INTERVENTION POLICY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Administration and Congress should institutionalize these steps in order to provide strategically sound criteria for military intervention in the post-Cold War world. The goal should be for Congress to have some oversight over America's military interventions without usurping the President's duty to form and implement a national military strategy. The President should codify his military intervention policy in a Presidential Decision Directive similar to PDD-25, but addressing more than multilateral peace operations. Unfortunately, there is no legal recourse against a President who insists on making poor strategic decisions. However, Congress can take steps to redress this problem through the National Security Strategy. This is a presidential document required by Section 603 of the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Department Reorganization Act of 1986. In this document, the President is required to lay out his national security strategy: when, where, why, and how he intends to use America's armed forces in promoting the goals of the nation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because President Clinton's National Security Strategy has failed to provide constructive criteria about America's role in the world and how the U.S. armed forces will support that role, Congress should consider an amendment to the 1997 defense authorization bill requiring the President to:
<p><ol>
<b><li>Prioritize national interests</b> and specify national security interests that the President will support through military intervention. 
<p>
<b><li>Stipulate the criteria</b>, such as the five listed here, that will be used to discriminate when, whether, where, and how the U.S. will undertake a military intervention. 
<p>
<b><li>Specify the criteria</b> used to decide when and in what capacity the U.S. will participate in multilateral military operations through coalitions, alliances, and other multilateral structures.
<p>
<b><li>State unequivocally</b> that he will consult Congress before launching military interventions that are not national emergencies.
<p>
<b><li>Declare</b> that U.S. military forces in interventions abroad will have clearly defined, decisive, and attainable military objectives that can be achieved decisively through proven military doctrine.
</ol><P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is always a measure of political and military risk to military intervention. However, by establishing workable criteria, the United States can minimize those risks or, at the very least, ensure that risks are consistent with costs. The Clinton Administration has not done well in measuring the value of its interventions and has persisted in costly and inconclusive operations on the periphery instead of focusing on America's core interests. By refusing to prioritize the value of national interests, the Administration has failed to understand the price, in magnitude and duration, that the American people are willing to pay to protect these interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Strategic priorities lend clarity and coherency to a national security strategy that addresses criteria for military intervention. They also help to allocate America's finite means among the many different challenges facing the U.S. today. Failing to match means to ends results in a credibility gap and severely strained forces, a condition the United States is approaching today.<sup>41</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition, if a military intervention is worth undertaking, and is better than other options, it also must be accomplishable. Thus, the U.S. must set clearly defined and achievable military objectives that the armed forces can achieve through their proven operational doctrine. Empty political "signaling" that overrides military requirements for successful operations is ultimately self-defeating. Most important, the objectives U.S. military forces achieve must be able to stand alone as politically decisive; the U.S. should not be in the business of making strategic gestures that are transient and easily reversible. Intervention must achieve a goal that serves the long-term security interests of the United States.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. owes it to its armed forces to give them every conceivable advantage in any intervention. This includes giving them enough autonomy to create the conditions they will need to succeed. It also means that when working in a multilateral framework, U.S. forces should have a unique and decisive role that makes sense for a global leader with singular capabilities. Finally, by keeping Congress and the American people involved, the President can assure that the value of his objective is understood by all and that the benefits from military intervention are worth the costs in blood and treasure.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Bill Clinton has recommended that the United States give more money to institutions like the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/html/Welcome.html">World Bank</a>. The Clinton Administration has obligated the U.S. to contribute $800 million to one of the Bank's agencies, the International Development Agency.<sup>2</sup>  This is about $100 million more than was requested for the last fiscal year. Spending more on the World Bank ignores the overwhelming evidence that its programs have done little to promote economic growth in less developed countries. Moreover, it ignores the economic lessons of what really causes countries to develop.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since its founding in 1944, the World Bank has been involved in over 165 countries. The Bank argues that less developed countries stand little chance to prosper economically without substantial subsidized loans from the developed world. It further contends that it is uniquely positioned to meet this challenge and that it must continue to transfer capital to poor countries.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The World Bank is wrong. The data show that most long-term recipients of World Bank money are no better off today then they were when they received their first loan. Many are actually worse off. Consider the following:
<p><ul>
<li>Of the 66 less developed countries receiving money from the World Bank for more than 25 years (most for more than 30 years), 37 are no better off today than they were before they received such loans.
<p>
<li>Of these 37 countries, most (20 in all) actually are poorer today than they were before receiving aid from the Bank.
</ul> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Former less developed countries that have prospered over the past 30 years did so by freeing up the productive forces of their economies. The best examples are Hong Kong and Singapore. Even though a country like Singapore received a small amount of money from the World Bank, the evidence shows that what most effected economic growth was not World Bank aid, but economic freedom.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress would do well to take a critical look at the World Bank's history and programs. If it does, it will find that the Bank's approach to economic development has not worked. Rather than let the Bank try to reform itself, as it claims it has tried repeatedly to do in the past, the U.S. should withdraw financial support altogether. Specifically, the U.S. Congress should:
<ul><li>
<b>Phase out financial support for the World Bank.</b> Last year the U.S. paid $1.2 billion to the World Bank. In addition, the U.S. has pledged some $28 billion to the World Bank that has not been disbursed. However, the Bank can call on the U.S. at any time to disburse funds up to this amount. While it would be best to end any future liabilities by terminating all World Bank funding immediately, at the very least Congress should begin to phase out funding for the Bank by cutting this year's budget request to no more than 50 percent of the current level. All funding should be terminated by 2002.
<p>
<li><b>Seek a General Accounting Office audit of World Bank lending practices.</b> The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) long has analyzed the effectiveness of such foreign aid programs. A new study should be commissioned to analyze the effectiveness of current World Bank lending practices.
<p>
<li><b>Make remaining funding contingent on public access to World Bank records and information.</b> The World Bank is a highly secretive organization, which blocks the ability of outsiders to monitor its effectiveness. Congress should make further funding contingent on the full release of World Bank records and information.
<p>
<li><b>Require that the Administration provide Congress with a report on the level of economic freedom in World Bank recipient countries.</b> Congress should require the U.S. Representative to the World Bank, Jan Piercy, to provide it with a report detailing the economic conditions that exist in countries that receive World Bank loans and grants.
</ul><p>
<b>WHAT IS THE WORLD BANK?</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Officially named the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the World Bank was founded in 1944 by the 44 nations that met at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to establish a new post-war international economic system. Today, the Bank has 178 members; only 12 nations are not members. The United States is the largest contributor, providing some $53 billion since 1944.<sup>3</sup>  Even though the U.S. has reduced its funding as a percentage of the Bank's total deposits from 29.3 percent in 1965 to 17.5 percent in 1995, it remains the Bank's largest donor and has pledged more money to the Bank than any other country.<sup>4</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
World Bank members provide contributions based on the size of their economies. The larger and wealthier the economy, the more the country is likely to give. A country's voting power is based on the amount of its contributions. Since the U.S. is the biggest donor, it therefore has the most voting power.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The World Bank is governed by several bodies. These are:
<p><ol>
<b><li> The Board of Governors.</b> Overall authority resides with a president and a board of governors. The board includes one individual from each member country. It meets annually to receive a report on financial matters from the executive directors, an elected group of 25 representatives from the Bank's total membership. The board also reviews any other matters that the executive directors present to it.
<P>
<b><li> Executive Directors.</b> General operations are overseen by a 25-member group of executive directors: one representative from each of the five largest donors (the United States, Japan, Germany, France, and Britain) and 20 elected by the remaining 174 donor countries. This group reviews loan proposals submitted by the president of the Bank and has the final authority to approve or decline a loan.
<p>
<b><li> The President.</b> The president of the World Bank is appointed by the executive directors, typically for a five-year term. Though no written article requires it, traditionally the president is an American. The current president, James D. Wolfensohn, formerly an international investment banker, was appointed to a five-year term on June 1, 1995.
</ol> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Arms of the World Bank.</b> There are several institutions that make up the World Bank, each with a unique mission. Throughout its 50-year history, members of the Bank have created many arms, known collectively as "the World Bank Group."<sup>5</sup>  These are the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the International Development Association (IDA), the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Each has its own mission and goals.
<p><ol>
<b><li> The International Finance Corporation (IFC).</b> The Bank established the IFC in 1956 to provide loan guarantees and subsidized loans to businesses in less developed countries. These loans, usually long-term, are focused on equity investment (like stock markets) and similar lending. Interest rates are supposed to be the going market rates, which vary between countries and with the proposed project. Maturity on the loans is generally 13 years, with a grace period of up to eight years. Some 80 percent of the funding is borrowed by the Bank from international financial markets and through public bond issues. The rest is borrowed from the IBRD. Each year, the IFC approves some $4 billion to $5 billion in new financing.<sup>6</sup>  In 1995, the U.S. contributed $36 million to the IFC.
<p>
<b><li>The International Development Association (IDA).</b> The Bank established the IDA in 1960 to provide assistance to poor countries that cannot afford to borrow money from the IBRD. The funds are provided separately by donor nations and through IBRD investment profits. Two types of loans have been offered through this branch of the Bank: IDA credits and Special Fund credits. The IDA no longer makes Special Fund credits, but many are still in effect. Special Fund credits were granted with a 50-year maturity and a 10-year grace period during which no interest was applied. The interest rate on these credits is merely 0.75 percent. IDA credits are now the IDA's sole lending vehicle. They have the same service charge as was applied to the Special Fund credits. They also have the same 10-year grace period, but a shorter maturity of 35 or 40 years.
<p>
The United States also is the largest shareholder in the IDA, holding some 15 percent of the total votes in 1995. The U.S. has contributed some $21 billion since 1960,<sup>7</sup> and contributed $1.1 billion in FY 1995 alone.
<p>
<b><li> The International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).</b> The Bank established the ICSID in 1966 to promote an increased flow of international investment to areas of the world where foreign investors chose not to invest. The ICSID arbitrates disputes, helps put countries seeking investment in touch with investors, and provides advice, analysis, and studies on investment opportunities around the world.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
<b><li> The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).</b> The Bank established MIGA in 1988 to remove some of the risk for investors investing in poor countries. MIGA provides investors with guarantees on many types of investments. It also provides governments with advice on improving their investment climate to attract more foreign investment. MIGA may insure up to 90 percent of an investment, with a current limit of $50 million per project. In 1995, it guaranteed some $672 million in investments and had another $210 million in outstanding credits.<sup>9</sup>  The U.S. contributed $22 million to MIGA in 1995.
</ol> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>How the World Bank Makes Loans and Grants.</b> Each year the Bank considers many loans. Though loan proposals officially are submitted by the president of the Bank to the executive directors, in reality the executive directors often work with the president's staff to develop proposals. Thus, the approval process is often merely a formality. The United States has no veto power over Bank loans, and the Bank frequently approves loans that the U.S. has opposed.<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Bank's funds are derived from country contributions and from investments the Bank makes in financial markets. The Bank sells bonds and other debt securities to pension funds, insurance companies, corporations, other banks, and individual investors. Its original source of income is contributions by member countries. Countries receiving loans are charged an interest rate, currently 7.27 percent. This rate is adjusted every six months. Maturity on the loans is generally from 15 to 20 years, with a five-year grace period.
<p>
<b>HISTORY OF THE WORLD BANK</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The World Bank has undergone a major transformation since it started in 1944. The Bank claims it has kept up with change to deal with the new challenges facing less developed countries. This contention is debatable, but it is true that the fundamental mission today is substantially different from what it was in 1944.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Lender of Last Resort.</b> In the beginning, the Bank's primary mission was to loan money to the war-ravaged countries of Western Europe and Japan to help them get on their feet after World War II. These loans were intended to help rebuild roads, bridges, electrical plants, and other public facilities and enterprises.<sup>11</sup>  Japan and the European countries would use World Bank loans when private bank loans were not forthcoming. Many private commercial banks refused to lend these nations money because they were bad risks, some of them having defaulted on World War I and post-World War I debts.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From 1944 to the mid-1950s, most World Bank loans went to the developed countries in Europe that had suffered extensive damage in World War II. Therefore, even though the Bank loaned some $543 million for the reconstruction of Europe, the money was absorbed by countries that essentially were advanced developed economies with strong economic foundations in banking, property rights protection, the rule of law, functioning courts, and borders open to foreign investment.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Because these countries already had the basic building blocks of an advanced economy, they were able to put the World Bank loans to productive use. Yet U.S. private investment in post-war Europe played a larger role in reconstruction than the World Bank. The World Bank loaned Western European countries $543 million from 1945-1950, while U.S. private investment was $1.76 billion for the same period.<sup>12</sup>  Therein lies the real success story of Europe's recovery. While it is true that funding from the World Bank, other financial institutions, and the Marshall Plan helped rebuild war-torn Europe, the biggest impact on Europe's economic recovery came from private foreign investment.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>An International Welfare Agency.</b> By the late 1950s, it became clear that the World Bank had served its purpose. Europe and Japan were well on their way to recovering from World War II. Private foreign investment was pouring into these regions to take advantage of their renewed economic strength. America realized its economic dominance in the world as U.S. investment flowed abroad to fuel economic development and growth. At this time, the Bank faced a fundamental choice: It could dissolve because its major goal had been met, or it could evolve into something not imagined by its creators.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Eventually, the World bank decided on the second course. By the mid-1960s, the Bank began to transform itself from a lender of last resort to an international welfare agency to assist the poor and less developed countries of the world. In 1960, for example, the Bank created the International Development Agency (IDA), which makes subsidized loans to poor countries either unable to afford private commercial loans or regarded as bad credit risks. Even though the original mission statement made casual reference to the "less developed" world, the Bank's founders largely had envisioned this as purely advisory. Yet the Bank began to give more than advice to less developed countries; in the 1960s, it began to give them substantial loans. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>McNamara's Brainchild.</b> The mastermind of this transformation was former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, who took charge of the World Bank in 1968. To fund McNamara's new international welfare clearinghouse, the Bank had to seek ever-increasing levels of contributions from donor countries. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Also under McNamara's watch, the Bank formulated a new concept, called "sustainable development," that became the IDA's principal mission. Stated simply, this means that less developed countries can achieve sustainable levels of economic development only if enough resources are transferred from wealthy countries to poor countries. If loans are any measure of success, McNamara was "successful" indeed. By 1981, when McNamara resigned as president of the World Bank, lending had grown more than tenfold, from $883 million to $12 billion. World Bank lending and grants continue to grow, today totaling over $20 billion.<sup>13</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The World Bank remains fully committed to this kind of thinking, with most of its bureaucrats dedicated to the McNamara dogma. A book published in 1995 by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to commemorate their 50-year anniversary claims that "This institutional evolution has been matched by a changing approach to development. The early focus on discrete projects has evolved into a broader emphasis on policies, strategies, and institutions, and a more holistic approach to development.... [The World Bank] Group's primary concern is to help borrowers reduce poverty and improve living standards by promoting sustainable growth and investment in people."<sup>14</sup>  In other words, the World Bank is not the institution created in 1944 by the Bretton Woods Agreement; it has changed from lender of last resort to international welfare agency.
<p>
<b>DECADES OF FAILED POLICIES</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While many of the Bank's economists are free to acknowledge the importance of macroeconomic reform in the recipe for economic growth, many of the Bank's officials continue to place too much emphasis on the importance of multilateral institutions to less developed countries. For example, former World Bank President Lewis T. Preston said in 1995: "Of fundamental importance, the Bank Group has evolved from being simply a financier of development to being also a trusted advisor on development, sharing its global experience of what does and does not work and helping its member countries to apply the lessons.... Fifty years of experience have validated the Bank Group's fundamental objective today: helping borrowers reduce poverty and improve living standards through sustainable growth and investment in people."<sup>15</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thus, the Bank seems to claim not only that it has been successful at reducing poverty and improving living standards in less developed countries, but also that its continued existence is vital to the economic prospects of less developed countries in the future. Yet all the evidence shows that this is not true. Since its inception, the World Bank has provided over $356 billion to countries around the world, mostly to the less developed world.<sup>16</sup>  But most recipients are no better off today than they were before receiving such aid. In fact, many are worse off. Consider the following:
<p><ul>
<li>Of the 66 less developed countries receiving money from the World Bank for more than 25 years (most for at least 30 years), 37 are no better off today than they were before they received such loans (see <a href="bg1082t1.gif">Table 1</a>);<sup>17</sup>
<p>
<li>Of these 37 countries, 20 actually are worse off today than they were before receiving aid from the World Bank (see <a href="bg1082t1.gif">Table 1</a>);<p>

<li>Of these 20, eight have economies that have shrunk by at least 20 percent since their first World Bank loan (see <a href="bg1082t1.gif">Table 1</a>); and<p>

<li>The remaining 17 countries have economies today that are essentially the same as when they first received aid from the World Bank (see <a href="bg1082t1.gif">Table 1</a>).
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While many countries are no better off today than before they received money from the World Bank, some have performed particularly poorly.
<ul>
<li>From 1965 to 1995, Nicaragua received over $637 million in World Bank aid. Its per capita gross domestic product in 1965, measured in constant 1987 U.S. dollars, was $1,752. Today it is only $875, some 50 percent less than before Nicaragua received any aid.
<p>
<li>The African country of Niger received over $589 million in World Bank aid from 1965 to 1995. Yet its per capita GDP has shrunk by 54 percent, from $605 in 1965 to $280 today.
The evidence shows that the World Bank has a poor track record. One might expect that at least half of its recipients would be better off economically today then before they started receiving such aid, but this is not the case. Many are actually worse off. After nearly three decades, it seems clear that most long-term recipients of World Bank loans still are not achieving "sustainable development."
</ul><p>
<b>WHY WORLD BANK PROGRAMS FAIL</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The main reason for a lack of economic growth in these countries is a corresponding lack of economic freedom. A lack of economic freedom prevents countries from creating wealth and prosperity, and a recent worldwide survey of economic freedom finds that many World Bank recipients have economies that are mostly not free or repressed. <I>The 1996 Index of Economic Freedom</I>, published by The Heritage Foundation, analyzes the level of economic freedom in 142 countries.<sup>18</sup>  The study considers ten economic factors -- trade, taxation, government consumption, monetary policy, banking, foreign investment, wage and price controls, private property rights, regulation, and black markets -- and categorizes each country as having a "free," "mostly free," "mostly not free," or "repressed" economy. The findings of the study demonstrate that a majority of World Bank loan and grant recipients do not have significant levels of economic freedom:
<p><ul>
<li>Of the 60 long-term recipients of World Bank aid that were graded in <I>The 1996 Index of Economic Freedom</I>, 37 have economies that are "mostly not free" or "repressed" (see <a href="bg1082t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
<p>
<li>Only 23 long-term recipients of World Bank aid have economies that are "mostly free," and none have economies that are "free" (see <a href="bg1082t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thus, most long-term recipients of World Bank loans and grants still do not have significant levels of economic freedom. Moreover, those recipients that have performed particularly poorly are the least economically free:
<p><ul>
<li>he 18 countries whose economies have shrunk since they have been World Bank recipients, 16 have either "mostly not free" or "repressed" economies (see <a href="bg1082t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Economic prosperity is not forthcoming in these countries because they do not have economic freedom. Rather, most have high taxes, barriers to trade, restrictions on foreign investment, banking systems in disarray, onerous government regulations, bad monetary policies, extensive wage and price controls, and large black markets. To be sure, 23 long-term recipients of World Bank aid do have mostly free economies, but most of these are in Latin America, an area which has benefited from several years of economic reform. Thus, their categorization as having mostly free economies is a recent phenomenon.<sup>19</sup>  It is good that they are making progress, but given the evidence elsewhere in the world, it would be difficult to attribute this progress to help from the World Bank.
<p>
<b>HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE: MODELS OF GROWTH WITHOUT WORLD BANK AID</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The poor record of the World Bank in delivering on its promise of economic development can be demonstrated not only by listing its many failures, but also by examining some development successes that occurred without the Bank's help. Hong Kong and Singapore are the most successful of the so-called Asian Tigers, running up phenomenal economic growth rates that are the envy of the developed world. They did this largely without loans from the World Bank. Even though they were as poor 30 years ago as other countries that took World Bank aid, they eschewed World Bank loans and embarked instead on successful programs of economic liberalization. The evidence shows that there is a direct correlation between the economic freedom these countries enjoy and their tremendous economic growth over the past 30 years. Of one thing there can be absolutely no doubt: World Bank assistance was in no way responsible for creating the best development success stories the world has seen during this 30-year period.
<p>
<b>Hong Kong </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the 1960s, the U.S. foreign aid community and international lending institutions like the World Bank decided that the East Asian region was barren of economic promise and that they should focus their aid on Africa instead. Hong Kong received no aid from the World Bank and only a small amount in U.S. foreign aid -- $43 million, most of which was cut off after 1965. The World Bank admitted that many economists misjudged the economic prospect in Asia. In the commemorative volume marking the Bank's 50th anniversary, the authors state: "In the 1960s, many economists were more optimistic about sub-Saharan Africa than East Asia. Yet, East Asia proved to be the 'miracle' of the developing world -- and sub-Saharan Africa its most daunting challenge."<sup>20</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While eschewing foreign aid after 1965, Hong Kong at the same time began a massive economic liberalization program. This included reforms in many sectors, including banking and financial services, government regulation of business, and foreign investment laws. Among the most important of these reforms was lowering barriers to international trade and making Hong Kong's trade laws consistent with international standards. The government eliminated virtually all tariffs, duties, licensing requirements, and other import barriers. It also set up export processing zones, or "free trade areas," that allowed manufacturers to cut through red tape to sell their products overseas.<sup>21</sup>  These reforms enabled Hong Kong to create a large export industry which provided much of the fuel for Hong Kong's economic growth.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another critically important reform took place when Hong Kong established a tax structure that allows individuals and businesses to keep most of the wealth they create. For example, Hong Kong has a flat tax of 20 percent on incomes over $155,000. The worker making the average income of about $22,500 is taxed only 2 percent. Hong Kong's corporate tax rate is a flat 16.5 percent, compared to 35 percent in the U.S.<sup>22</sup>  These and other economic reforms helped turn Hong Kong into the economic powerhouse it is today.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

After these economic reforms were in place, Hong Kong's economy indeed took off. GDP increased 9.2 percent a year from 1970 to 1980. From 1980 to 1993, it increased an additional 6.5 percent.<sup>23</sup>  Overall, over the past 35 years, Hong Kong's per capita GDP has grown an astonishing 530 percent, with most of this growth occurring since the beginning of economic liberalization.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
<b>Singapore </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Singapore also exhibited little economic promise in the early 1960s, according to the economic forecasts of the day. In fact, it was often referred to as "Asia's Cuba."<sup>25</sup>  The World Bank gave most of its loans to Singapore -- some $93 million -- before 1970. Singapore received its last World Bank loan in 1975.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As World Bank loans were drying up, Singapore, like Hong Kong, embarked on a course of economic liberalization -- with the same stunning results. Starting in the late 1960s and continuing into the 1970s, Singapore instituted a series of economic reforms aimed at achieving two major goals. The first was to promote increased foreign investment and higher levels of exports. To this end, Singapore opened its market to foreign investors. By 1970, some 80 to 90 percent of all manufactured exports were derived from foreign investment.<sup>26</sup>  Why did foreign investment pour into Singapore?  There are many reasons. One surely was that Singapore's legal system, based in British common law, provided rule of law, an efficient legal system, and a way for investors to achieve protection of their investments through contracts. Equally important was the fact that Singapore established a foreign investment code, free of local content or production restrictions, that guaranteed equal treatment under the law for both domestic and foreign firms.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The second goal was to reform Singapore's tax system. Singapore adopted a tax system that reduced the burden on most of the people. For example, while the top tax rate is 30 percent, the tax on the average income level of $21,000 is little or none. In fact, the average Singapore worker must make almost $30,000 before paying taxes. For that first tax bracket, the rate is 19 percent.<sup>27</sup>  In addition, Singapore resisted the implementation of onerous business regulations; abolished trade restrictions on imports (the average tariff rate now is about 0.4 percent, compared to 3.3 percent in the U.S.); and has kept inflation below 3 percent a year since the mid-1970s.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These economic reforms helped increase Singapore's gross domestic product. From 1970 to 1980, GDP increased by 8.3 percent a year. From 1980 to 1993, it increased an additional 6.9 percent. Overall, Singapore's gross national product has increased by over 6 percent a year since 1965.<sup>28</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Hong Kong and Singapore have achieved the highest levels of economic prosperity to be found anywhere among the world's recently developed countries. In fact, they have achieved phenomenal economic growth rates that are the envy of the developed world. The evidence suggests that their policies of economic freedom are the principal reason for this success. There is a direct correlation between the economic freedom these countries have achieved and their tremendous economic growth over the past 30 years.<sup>29</sup>  There is also a direct correlation between this growth and a lack of aid from the World Bank. World Bank assistance was in no way responsible for creating the best development success stories the world has seen over the past 30 years (see <a href="bg1082c1.gif">Chart 1</a>):
<p>
<b>PHASING OUT SUPPORT FOR THE WORLD BANK</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The facts show that the World Bank's approach to economic development is a failure. The facts also show that countries which adopt free market economic reforms can develop without aid from the World Bank or any other institution. Promises by the World Bank to reform have made little difference. The U.S. therefore should begin withdrawing its financial support. Specifically, Congress should:
<ul><p>
<li><b>Phase out financial support for the World Bank. </b>Ideally, the U.S. Congress would refuse immediately to appropriate any more money to the World Bank. But with current political realities, this approach seems unlikely. Therefore, the most workable approach would be for Congress to phase out U.S. funding over seven years. In the event the Clinton Administration refuses to sign onto a seven-year balanced budget, Congress then should seek to withdraw funding through the appropriations process.
<p>
<li><b>Seek a General Accounting Office audit of World Bank lending practices.</b> The General Accounting Office (GAO) long has performed intensive analyses of such programs as foreign aid. Many of these audits have concluded that much of the U.S. foreign aid program is fraught with waste, fraud, and abuse; in some cases, these audits have discovered that programs simply do not work. The last GAO report dealing specifically with the World Bank, published in 1994, found that most of the Bank's reforms have failed to make it more efficient and effective.<sup>30</sup>  Congress should call on the GAO to launch a new study of the effectiveness of World Bank lending, to focus on:
<p>
<b>1)</b> The economic performance of recipients of World Bank aid;
<p>
<b>2)</b> The effectiveness and efficiency of World Bank programs in meeting their stated goals;
<p>
<b>3)</b> The influence the World Bank has on encouraging recipient countries to adopt specific economic policies; and
<p>
<b>4)</b> Conducting an audit of the World Bank's financial records.
<p>
<li><b>Make remaining funding contingent on public access to World Bank records and information.</b> It is difficult to obtain detailed information on the recipients of World Bank loans, the conditions imposed on loan recipients, and the number and amount of loans in default. While the World Bank is an international organization, it is partly funded by the American taxpayer, who has a right to know how the money is being spent. The American public and Congress should have access to all of the Bank's financial records and information. As long as Congress continues to appropriate money for the World Bank, it should make that funding contingent on free and open access to World Bank information.
<p>
<li><b>Require that the Administration provide Congress with a report on the level of economic freedom in World Bank recipient countries.</b> While the World Bank continues to lend money to countries with little chance of growing economically, there is no accounting of the economic conditions in many of these countries. Congress should require the U.S. Representative to the World Bank, Jan Piercy, to provide Congress with a report detailing the economic conditions that exist in countries that receive World Bank funding. Specifically, the report should include information on the level of economic freedom that exists in the following areas: trade, taxation, government consumption, monetary policy, banking, foreign investment, regulation, wage and price controls, and property rights.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>

Since 1944, the World Bank has spent $346 billion trying to advance economic development around the world, and not all of this money has been repaid. While it played an important role in getting Europe on its feet after World War II, the World Bank has drifted away from its original mission to become little more than a clearinghouse for international welfare. Most recipients of loans and grants are no better off today than when they first received them. In fact, many are worse off.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Clearly, the World Bank's approach to economic development is a failure. But while recipients of World Bank loans continue to wallow in poverty, countries like Hong Kong and Singapore continue to experience unprecedented growth. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While there is overwhelming evidence to show the futility of such aid, the U.S. continues to support this failed institution, providing over $50 billion to the Bank in 1995, including both monetary allocations and commitments. American policymakers should admit this failure and begin phasing out U.S. financial support for the World Bank over seven years. Not only will billions in U.S. taxpayer dollars be saved, but countries in the less developed world may be able finally to break the economic chains that have kept them impoverished.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Using distressing stories of laid-off workers, decreasing paychecks, and increasing income inequality, some politicians and journalists have been painting a picture of economic gloom and doom in America. At the same time, the economy exhibits increasing employment, low inflation, and growth. Still, while the economy appears to be doing well, many Americans see themselves as struggling to make ends meet and feel they are worse off than their parents were a generation ago. This raises the obvious question: Are middle-income and low-income workers falling farther behind, or is the standard of living increasing for most Americans?
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What has really been happening to wages, profits, and incomes in recent decades?
<p><ul>
<li>There has been a decline in average real cash wages since 1973, but this does not mean a decrease in the American standard of living. In fact, most workers are better off today because their real compensation and real per capita income continue to increase. Moreover, a broad array of measures indicates that the standard of living for most Americans continues to rise.
<p>
<li>There is no evidence to support the popular argument that rising corporate profits have come at the expense of workers. Corporate profits and labor compensation generally rise and fall together. Whether corporate profits are falling or rising as a share of national income, the employees' share of a growing economy remains fairly constant.
<p>
<li>The slow growth in take-home pay is not the result of "corporate greed."  It is the result of a slowdown in the growth of productivity, caused in part by the growth of government taxes and regulations on business and investment. Higher taxes also are taking an ever-larger bite out of personal income, leaving a smaller and smaller share for individuals to spend, save, and invest.
<p>
<li>Although the income difference between high-wage and low-wage workers has increased, a majority of men and women have seen their real earnings increase. Studies suggest the increasing divergence in the earnings of high-wage and low-wage workers is due primarily to an acceleration in the rate of technological change favoring those with higher skills, changes in the composition of the workforce, and a substantial shift in demand for the products of different industries. Increased trade and the number of low-skilled immigrants, however, have had only a small effect on wage patterns.
<p>
<li>The dynamic U.S. economy is characterized by an extraordinary degree of income mobility which has been all but ignored in the controversy over wage differences. The notion that low-income or high-income groups are composed of the same people, stuck in the same jobs over time, is an illusion. Data on income mobility reveal that most workers' incomes increase over time. In America, the upward movement of workers in the lowest, second-lowest, and middle-income groups is much larger than the downward movement.
</ul> <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The conventional wisdom is that wages are falling, the middle class is moving down instead of up, and corporate profits are rising at the expense of workers. But like so many other examples of conventional wisdom, it is wrong. The truth is that most workers are better off today because their real earnings are increasing and their standard of living continues to rise. Both corporate profits and labor compensation are growing, and although the difference between high-wage and low-wage workers has increased, the U.S. economy remains dynamic and productive enough to enable most Americans to work their way up the economic ladder.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To the extent that real wages are falling for some workers, the solution is not higher taxes, more mandates and government programs, or job-killing increases in the minimum wage. Instead, what is needed are policies that focus on the primary problems: high taxes and excessive regulation. Removing these obstacles will increase productivity, job opportunities, and real wage growth for all Americans.
<p>

<b>HOW COMPENSATION INCREASES WHILE WAGE GROWTH STAGNATES</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There has been a decline in average real cash wages since 1973, but this does not mean a decrease in the American standard of living.<sup>1</sup>  In fact, most workers are better off today because their real compensation and real per capita income continue to increase.<sup>2</sup>  The reason for this is that workers are taking home more of their pay in the form of tax-free benefits than ever before.<sup>3</sup>  Hourly wages do not account for the increasing tendency of employees to receive their "pay" in the form of untaxed fringe benefits.<sup>4</sup>  Moreover, hourly wage data are limited as to the types of employees they cover, further understating actual wage growth.<sup>5</sup>  Real compensation thus is a more accurate measure of the "pay" American workers receive because it includes benefits, such as health care and pension payments, as well as cash.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As <a href="fyi97c1.gif">Chart 1</a> illustrates, total compensation has increased even when average wages have declined. From 1959 to 1973, real hourly compensation increased by an average of 2.8 percent per year.<sup>6</sup>  Between 1973 and 1994, real hourly compensation increased an average of 0.4 percent per year. The problem is not that the average cash wage has declined, but that total "pay" has grown more slowly since 1973. The reason: a slowdown in the growth of productivity caused in part by the proliferation of government regulations, mandates, and higher taxes, all of which reduce the net value of a worker's output, which leads in turn to a slowdown in compensation.<sup>7</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Most of the growth in real compensation since 1986 can be attributed to the fact that benefits have increased faster than cash wages (see <a href="fyi97c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). Although real wage growth as measured by the Employment Cost Index has stagnated since 1986, sharply rising benefits have increased total compensation by 1.9 percent.<sup>8</sup>  Between 1981 and 1995, real employee benefits have increased 26.8 percent as workers have continued to demand more of their total pay in the form of tax-free benefits, and the cost of providing those benefits has increased.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While real compensation for most Americans has increased, workers correctly believe that they should be better off today than they are. Tax increases in the 1990s deprived them of a higher standard of living by undercutting the economy's rate of growth, undercutting productivity gains, and holding back pay increases.<sup>9</sup>  If workers and businesses were not burdened with large tax and regulatory increases, total compensation and real take-home pay would be higher.
<p>
<b>HIGHER PROFITS BENEFIT WORKERS, FALLING PROFITS LIMIT COMPENSATION GROWTH</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is no evidence to support the popular assumption that rising corporate profits and the record high stock market have come at the expense of workers.<sup>10</sup>  <I>The Washington Post</I> was correct when it editorialized: "[Secretary of Labor Robert Reich] charges that the productivity improvements are going disproportionately to corporations. That's not the real explanation. While corporate profits, as a share of total economic output, are slightly higher than in the late 1980s, they remain lower than in the 1970s. The causes of the country's poor wage performance lie elsewhere."<sup>11</sup>  Those causes also do not include the trade deficit or immigration, both of which increased during the 1980s at the same time labor compensation increased significantly.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Whether corporate profits are falling or rising as a share of national income, labor's share of a growing economy remains fairly constant (see <a href="fyi97c3.gif">Chart 3</a>). The share of national income going to corporate profits declined in a seesaw fashion from 14.1 percent in 1965 to a post-World War II low of 6.0 percent in 1982. Workers' share of national income, however, rose from 68.1 percent in 1965 to 74.2 percent in 1970 and has remained relatively stable ever since.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Corporate profits and labor compensation generally rise and fall together (see <a href="fyi97c4.gif">Chart 4</a>). When corporate profits declined in 1974, labor compensation declined too. When corporate profits declined from 1979 to 1982, compensation failed to increase. Corporate profits resumed their increase in 1983, and labor compensation followed suit, increasing by 23.3 percent from 1982 to 1988. From 1988 to 1991, the growth of corporate profits declined and labor compensation stagnated; when corporate profits began to increase again in 1992, however, so did labor compensation.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Higher profits also benefit workers because they are shareholders. Sixty-four percent of all workers are employed by companies with pension plans, and 50 percent of all workers participate in those plans.<sup>12</sup>  Nineteen percent of all workers also have their own individual retirement accounts (IRAs).
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is no evidence to support the popular argument that rising corporate profits have come at the expense of workers. Corporate profits and labor compensation generally rise and fall together. Real labor compensation has risen $340 billion (in 1992 dollars) between 1991 and 1995, and corporate profits have increased $152 billion over the same period. Moreover, the fixed-pie assertion that a higher level of after-tax profits means less income available for labor compensation or tax revenue for the government is simply wrong. The problem is that the share of national income taken by all levels of government has increased from 32 percent in 1965 to 39 percent in 1994.<sup>13</sup>  This leaves a steadily smaller share for private citizens to spend, save, and invest.
<p>
	
<b>WAGE AND INCOME DIFFERENCES HAVE INCREASED</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Wage growth and wage differences are two distinct concepts,<sup>14</sup> but they interact to shape a worker's sense of well-being. If all real wages increase, everyone is better off, even if there is a widening difference in earnings. On the other hand, if average real wages stagnate while wage differences are growing, low-wage workers as a group may become poorer as the rich grow richer.<sup>15</sup>  In the case of the United States, the former pattern holds true: The standard of living for most Americans actually continues to rise, even though both wage and income differences have widened.<sup>16</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  Studies suggest that there are several reasons for widening wage differences. The accelerated rate of technological change, for example, favors those with higher skills. Also, changes in the composition of the workforce -- including a slowdown in the relative growth rate of college graduates and the increasing labor force attachment of women -- lead to a divergence of incomes. And there has been a substantial shift in demand for the products of different industries (such as lower paying services replacing higher paying manufacturing).<sup>17</sup>  The increase in low-skilled immigrants (both legal and otherwise) and trade, however, had only a small effect on wage patterns in the 1980s.<sup>18</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since 1973, income differences among families also have grown because of the sharp rise in the proportion of Americans who live in families with no male workers, growing differences in earnings among men, and the increasing likelihood that in a traditional family both husband and wife will be working.<sup>19</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The size of a family makes a difference. Census Bureau income data collected according to the presence of children show that while families with no children experienced a 36 percent increase in real median income over the past 25 years, families with one or two children did considerably less than half that well. The real median income of families with more than three children declined over the same period.<sup>20</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although the difference between high-wage and low-wage workers has increased, a majority of men saw their real earnings rise 5 percent or more from 1979 to 1989, and a large majority of women (76 percent) saw their earnings increase.21  Moreover, a broad array of measures indicates that the standard of living for most Americans continues to rise. To the extent that real wages are falling for some workers, the solution is not higher taxes, more mandates, or job-killing increases in the minimum wage. Instead, what is needed are lower taxes for families and reforms that will increase worker productivity and job opportunities for Americans by, for example, improving basic education and encouraging more investment.
<p>
<b>MORE AMERICANS ARE MOVING UP THE ECONOMIC LADDER</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The dynamic U.S. economy is characterized by an extraordinary degree of income mobility which has been all but ignored in the controversy over wage differences. The notion that low-income or high-income groups are composed of the same people over time is an illusion. Data on income mobility reveal that most workers' incomes increase over time. The comparison of average incomes by group would be meaningful only if America were a caste society in which the people comprising one group remained constant. This is one reason why Americans with modest incomes tend to resist "soak the rich" class warfare arguments: They hope to be rich one day themselves. Further, average wage statistics are affected by economic changes that do not adversely affect most American workers.<sup>22</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s, there was considerable upward mobility for those in the lower-income and middle-income groups.<sup>23</sup>  For example, from 1979 to 1988, the income of 85.8 percent of workers in the lowest income group had increased enough to move them up into a higher-income group.<sup>24</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Income mobility is important, but the direction of that mobility is more important. Needless to say, some people move up while others are moving down (see <a href="fyi97c5.gif">Chart 5</a>). But in America, the upward movement of workers in the lowest, second-lowest, and middle-income groups is much larger than the downward movement. From 1979 to 1988, the income of 60.1 percent of workers in the second-lowest income group had increased enough to move them up into a higher income group, and 47.3 percent of workers in the middle group had moved up.<sup>25</sup>  Over the same period, much smaller percentages of workers were moving down: only 10.9 percent of the second-lowest group and 19.7 percent of the middle group.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The possibility of moving down increases as incomes rise, while the probability that low-wage workers will move up is much greater for those in the lowest quintile. Moreover, a worker in the lowest income group was more likely to have moved into the top income group by 1988 than to have remained in the bottom group.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More than 60 percent of all workers can point to a minimum wage job as their first job experience.<sup>26</sup>  Some 40 percent of workers starting a minimum wage job receive their first raise within 4 months, and 63 percent of those workers earn 20 percent more than the minimum wage within 12 months.<sup>27</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. economy, while not without problems, thus remains dynamic, open, and productive enough to enable most Americans in the bottom income groups to work their way up the economic ladder. What is needed is policies to ensure that the opportunity for advancement is extended as widely as possible.
<p>
<b>INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS: MORE EQUALITY AND LESS GROWTH</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Concern about stagnating wages and increasing income inequality has some politicians looking to Europe for solutions. But proponents of government actions to "alleviate inequality" would do well to ponder the anemic job growth in Europe. European firms are encumbered with costly mandates and taxes that have discouraged hiring and held back employment growth,<sup>28</sup> so while incomes are more equal in Europe, this equality comes with a very high price in terms of economic growth, new jobs, and inflation.
<P><ul>
<li>From 1983 to 1993, the U.S. economy has grown an average of 2.9 percent per year, compared with 2.3 percent in the European Union.<sup>29</sup>
<p>
<li>Between 1970 and 1992, employment increased in the United States by 49 percent, compared with only 9 percent in the European Community.<sup>30</sup>
<p>
<li>Europe's employment rate (the proportion of its population of working age that is working) is the lowest of any industrialized part of the world. Moreover, it has fallen over the past two decades. The employment rate in the United States, which started in 1970 at a level similar to the European Community's, has grown in two decades to its current level of around 70 percent.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<li>From 1983 to 1993, the U.S. unemployment rate averaged 6.9 percent per year, compared with 9.9 percent in the European Union.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<li>From 1983 to 1993, consumer prices in the U.S. rose an average of 3.7 percent per year, compared with 5.1 percent in the European Union.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
<li>Although wage differences between low-income and middle-income workers are much higher in the United States than in Europe, the relative differences between middle-income and high-income workers are the same.<sup>34</sup>
</ul>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Europe is now realizing that its existing collective bargaining, tax, and labor cost arrangements do not create more jobs; instead, they cause gains from economic growth to be absorbed mainly by those already employed. European Community member states are seeking to remove obstacles to employment growth by adjusting employer taxes, the idea being to make more jobs available to the relatively less-skilled by reducing the cost to employers. They also are lowering the relative cost of labor with respect to other factors of production -- for example, by reducing the employers' social security contributions. These are precisely the types of policies that should be adopted in the United States instead of more mandates and labor market restrictions.
<p>
<b>TAXES AND MANDATES LIMIT TAKE-HOME PAY AND EMPLOYMENT GROWTH</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Real compensation and benefits are important, but take-home pay is what matters most to workers.<sup>35</sup>  The slow growth in take-home pay is not the result of corporate greed or trade deficits.<sup>36</sup>  It is the result of a slowdown in the growth of productivity caused in part by the expansion of government regulation, which in turn reduces the net value of workers' output and contributes to slower wage growth.<sup>37</sup>  Further, an ever-larger share of workers' total pay (wages and benefits) is beyond their control, consumed by mandated benefits and taxes.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As <a href="fyi97c6.gif">Chart 6</a> illustrates, productivity growth has slowed since 1973, leading to reductions in the growth of workers' pay. From 1959 to 1973, productivity increased an average of 3.2 percent per year, and real hourly compensation increased by an average of 2.8 percent per year.<sup>38</sup>  Between 1973 and 1994, however, productivity growth slowed to an average of 1.3 percent per year, and real hourly compensation growth increased an average of 0.4 percent per year.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Government taxes and fees at all levels are taking an ever-increasing bite out of personal income (see <a href="fyi97c7.gif">Chart 7</a>). Although personal income per person increased 121 percent from 1959 to 1995, government taxes and fees paid per person at all levels increased 155 percent over the same period. In 1994, federal, state, and local governments took an average of $2,800 (in 1992 dollars) from every man, woman, and child.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Several studies also point to the job-destroying effect of the regulatory and mandate explosion in recent years.<sup>39</sup>  For example:
<ul><p>
<li>There are at least 3 million fewer jobs in the American economy today because of the growth of regulation over the last 20 years.<sup>40</sup>
<p>
<li>A 1990 study estimated that environmental regulations alone had caused national employment to be 1.2 percent less in 1990 than it otherwise would have been.<sup>41</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1994, legally required benefits<sup>42</sup> accounted for 8.9 percent of total employer payrolls, up from 6.3 percent in 1971 and 3.5 percent in 1951.<sup>43</sup>  These mandated benefits are not "free" to the worker, as many employees assume. A range of studies indicates that, on average, 88 percent of the cost of all legally required benefits or payroll taxes is shifted to workers in the form of reduced cash compensation.<sup>44</sup>
<p>
<li>The increase in mandated benefits does not include the cost to employers and workers of complying with workplace safety and health regulations.<sup>45</sup>  One study has estimated that 19 percent of the productivity slowdown during the 1970s is directly attributable to regulations published by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).<sup>46</sup>
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Up to a certain point, government functions enhance economic well-being. Beyond that point, however, the burden of excessive government reduces economic growth.<sup>47</sup>  Employers and workers are straining under unnecessarily burdensome regulations, mandates, and high taxes on labor and capital. This increasing drag on economic freedom has slowed growth, job creation, and wage gains. Government must roll back taxes, reduce the regulatory burden, and balance the budget to unshackle the economy and increase the real wages of all American workers.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The conventional wisdom is that wages are down, the middle class is shrinking, corporations are getting fat, and the rich are getting richer at the expense of the poor. Like most other examples of conventional wisdom, it is wrong.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States remains a nation of extraordinary opportunity and mobility. The real wages of high-income, middle-income, and low-income workers do not come at the expense of each other; they rise and fall together. The U.S. economy remains dynamic, open, and productive enough to enable most Americans to work their way up the economic ladder. To the extent that real wages are falling for some workers, the solution is not more government programs, trade restrictions, or job-killing increases in the minimum wage; it is policies that focus on the primary problems: high taxes and slow productivity growth. Only by correcting these problems can we increase job opportunities and real wages for all Americans.

<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two key advisory boards for the Medicare program, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (PROPAC) and Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC), have joined in the calls for Congress and the President to slow the explosive growth in Medicare spending.  The annual reports of both official panels also shed light on the deficiencies in Medicare's complex system of price controls.  In the case of PROPAC, there is a clear acknowledgment that the "dynamic process" works by shifting the rising costs of the Medicare program over to workers and their families in the private sector.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Created by Congress in 1983, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (PROPAC) advises Members of Congress and the Secretary of the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Medicare reimbursement for hospitals and other medical facilities.  Created by Congress in 1985, the Physician Payment Review Commission was charged with advising Congress on physician payment reform, and later with advising Congress on Medicare fee schedules for doctors.  It also examines the related issues of patient access, utilization, and assignment policies.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In practice, PROPAC's main responsibility is to advise Congress on how to regulate hospital rates under the Prospective Payment System (PPS), Medicare's hospital fee schedule; the PPS is essentially a complicated price control system.<sup>1</sup>  PROPAC currently is chaired by Stuart H.  Altman, Ph.D., a professor of health care policy at Brandeis University and formerly a key adviser on health care policy to President Clinton.<sup>2</sup>  The PPRC's main responsibility is giving advice to Congress on regulating the Medicare fees of doctors, in particular the administration of Medicare's Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS),<sup>3</sup> in conjunction with standards governing the volume of medical services and limitations on billing.  The PPRC is chaired by Gail Wilensky, Ph.D., of Project Hope, formerly the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) under President George Bush.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In its most recent report,<sup>4</sup> PROPAC outlines 26 separate recommendations governing various aspects of hospital payment and other features of the Medicare program.  Most of these are technical and include detailed recommendations concerning payment schedules.  The PPRC's 401-page report also makes numerous technical recommendations on various aspects of Medicare reimbursements.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But more significant are the panels' recommendations on general Medicare reform.  These recommendations touch on Medicare's fundamental structure and financing, as well as the growth in overall Medicare spending.  Specifically:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Both panels emphasizes the urgent need to control Medicare spending,</b> and PROPAC notes that despite partisan rhetoric, the White House and Congress are quite close in their targets for spending control;
<p>
<li><b>Both call for giving beneficiaries more choices;</b>
<p>
<li><b>Neither panel opposes medical savings accounts (MSAs)</b>, in contrast with the White House; and
<p>
<li><b>Both panels note the limitations and heavy costs</b> associated with today's Medicare price controls.
</ul><p>

<b>WHAT THE PANELS SAY ABOUT REFORM</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress showed great political courage in attempting structural reform of the Medicare program.  While that reform was vetoed by President Clinton, recent reports on the operating deficit of the hospital trust fund underscore the need for urgent action to contain costs and reorganize the 30-year-old program.  Members of Congress should heed the Commissions' contributions to the reform debate, particularly on technical issues.  Many of these are particularly helpful and may suggest ways of resolving some of the disputes between Congress and the White House.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider some key observations:
<p>
<b>Observation #1:  Both panels urge Congress to slow the growth in Medicare spending.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Says PROPAC:  "The rise in Medicare spending threatens the solvency of the program's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, its primary source of income.  Moreover, it has been a major contributor to the federal budget deficit."<sup>5</sup>  The Commission notes that between 1967 and 1993, Medicare spending jumped thirtyfold.  Between 1980 and 1993, Medicare spending was climbing in excess of 11 percent per year.  As the Medicare trustees noted last year, the Medicare hospitalization program, which already has run a deficit for the first time in 1995, is expected to go bankrupt in the year 2002 or possibly even sooner.  The Medicare payment for physicians services, also known as Medicare Part B, while not facing insolvency, is taking an ever-larger share of general revenues to break even, rising from 49 percent of Part B income in 1972 to 72 percent in 1993.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under current law, taxpayers are required to cover Part B expenditures automatically:  "The growth in Part B Medicare spending, therefore, increases the federal budget and contributes to the deficit."<sup>6</sup>  By 1995, Medicare spending reached $177 billion, an amount equal to 12 percent of the federal budget.  By the year 2002, it will reach $332 billion, and Medicare, together with Medicaid, which covers the poor and the indigent, will equal approximately 27 percent of the federal budget:  "[The Congressional Budget Office] points to the rapid growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending as the major factor driving up its deficit projections."<sup>7</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Likewise, the PPRC says, Medicare's "growth has outpaced defense and social security, and today is second only to net interest payments on the national debt.  And while Medicare expenditures are expected to continue accelerating at annual rates of 8.6 percent to 10 percent from now until 2005, rates of growth in federal outlays for other national priorities are expected to decline."<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
PROPAC notes that the private sector has been more successful in recent years in controlling health care costs and recommends a similar slowing of Medicare costs:  "Over time, spending for services furnished to Medicare enrollees should increase at rates comparable to those in a cost- and quality-conscious private sector."<sup>9</sup>  Similarly, PPRC says, "recent data showing that private sector health spending is growing more slowly than Medicare expenditures have reinforced the view that greater discipline in spending is possible without threatening access or quality of care."<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<b>Observation #2:  PROPAC notes that the budget debate obscures a significant fact:  Both the White House and Congress are relatively close in their efforts to slow the growth of Medicare spending.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Notes the Commission:  "The annual increase in Medicare spending is similar in all proposals, ranging from 7.2 percent to 7.6 percent.  The variation in total savings, however, is much greater due to differences in the growth of Part B premiums among the proposals."<sup>11</sup>  If nothing is done to curb the growth in Medicare spending, the Congressional Budget Office projects that it will grow between 1995 and 2002 at a rate of 9.4 percent annually.  Neither Congress nor the White House regards this rate of growth as acceptable.  Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, enacted by Congress and vetoed by President Clinton, Medicare spending would rise at an annual rate of 7.2 percent.<sup>12</sup>  President Clinton proposed a Medicare reform package that would have established an annual growth rate of 7.6 percent.  A third proposal, offered by a coalition of members of the House of Representatives, would have set annual spending increases at 7.5 percent.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Observation #3:  Both panels agree that Congress and the President should give Medicare enrollees the personal and financial benefits of consumer choice and competition. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Says PROPAC:  "Medicare beneficiaries should have a wider range of health plan options.  Under the current program beneficiary choice is largely limited to the traditional fee for service program and, where available, an HMO option.  Additional alternatives would let Medicare beneficiaries choose the type of plan that best meets their needs and would permit new beneficiaries enrolled in a particular type of plan before retirement to stay in that arrangement.  In addition, more alternatives could increase plan competition for Medicare beneficiaries on the basis of additional benefits and quality."<sup>14</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress's plan would have given enrollees a broad range of choice.  PROPAC notes that the congressional "MedicarePlus would allow a broad array of managed care plans, including preferred provider organizations (PPOs) to participate.  Fee for service plans also would be permitted.  New options not widely available in the private market, such as medical savings accounts (MSAs) and provider sponsored networks, also could be offered to beneficiaries.  All MedicarePlus plans would receive a capitation payment from Medicare."<sup>15</sup>  PROPAC also acknowledges that the Clinton plan would give less choice to elderly Americans than the congressional plan:  "The President also has proposed expanding the risk program, but the changes would be less comprehensive than those Congress has envisioned under MedicarePlus.  Beneficiaries would be able to enroll in qualified PPO's and provider sponsored organizations as well as HMOs.  Most enrollees would be able to join one of those plans only during annual open enrollment periods.  Private fee for service plans and high deductible plans combined with MSAs would not be among the available options."<sup>16</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
PROPAC observes that the creation of a market-oriented Medicare system characterized by consumer choice and competition would encourage private organizations to promote and disseminate vital consumer information:  "As the number of choices under Medicare increases either through the current program or expansions, private entities likely will begin distributing information about these choices to beneficiaries.  Although this is appropriate, Medicare should not abandon its responsibility to ensure that beneficiaries receive unbiased, comparable and reliable data."<sup>17</sup>  The Secretary of HHS, much like the Director of the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in administering the consumer-based Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) for federal workers and retirees, could play an important role in providing unbiased plan information to Medicare enrollees, according to PROPAC:  "The Secretary should continue efforts to identify the information beneficiaries need to make informed health plan choices and the most appropriate format for it.  This is even more critical as health plan choices are expanded for Medicare beneficiaries.  The Secretary should explore initiatives that would, for example, measure the satisfaction of beneficiaries who used services, describe total benefits available in an area (including those covered under insurance policies offered as supplements to Medicare) and document performance of individual providers within a plan."<sup>18</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The PPRC similarly favors an aggressive information program for Medicare consumers on plan options in a reformed and modernized Medicare system, showing consumers costs and benefits, including the costs and benefits of enrollment in health maintenance organization (HMO) plans.  Says the PPRC:  "Plans should disclose information about the general nature of the financial incentives faced by providers who contract with a health plan."<sup>19</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
PROPAC recommends the expansion of Medicare's limited capitation program and patient choice:  "The Commission supports reforming the Medicare captitation program to control spending while expanding beneficiary choice."<sup>20</sup>
<p>
<b>Observation #4:  Surprisingly, neither official panel comes out in opposition to medical savings accounts (MSAs).  Both panels acknowledge that MSAs would provide additional choice for the elderly and note that most, though not all, Medicare beneficiaries choosing MSAs would benefit financially from their choices.  The panels do emphasize that MSAs must be carefully designed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
According to PROPAC, "Most beneficiaries who selected the Medicare MSA option probably would benefit financially.  Beneficiaries who did not anticipate using health services would be attracted to this option, because they would expect to keep unspent MSA funds."<sup>21</sup>  The Commission notes that the effectiveness of MSAs in the area of cost control would be determined largely by the way they are designed.  Specifically, senior citizens would likely be prudent purchasers of medical services if they saw the money in their MSAs as their own money and viewed anything unspent as personal savings.  The MSAs must be designed as a savings vehicle.  If they are improperly designed or presented, and if the elderly do not understand the money in the account to be potential savings, and not just an account for health services, the MSA could become a "spending plan" and, PROPAC notes, thus would "tend to reduce beneficiaries' restraint in purchasing health services."<sup>22</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another issue related to MSAs is the problem of adverse selection.  Critics claim that MSAs would be selected mainly by healthy seniors, which could lead to a large increase in Medicare spending rather than a reduction.  PROPAC says that the current risk adjustment mechanism in the Medicare system is inadequate to deal with the problem of adverse selection.  This has consequences for MSAs.  PROPAC suggests that in developing an MSA program, policymakers should scrutinize its design carefully, with special attention to the amount of funds deposited, the length of time before persons may disenroll, and the "features" of the high-deductible plan.<sup>23</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is strong opposition to MSAs among liberals in Congress, particularly in the Senate, and in the Clinton Administration.  Thus, it is significant that PROPAC, which serves as an official advisory board for Medicare, does not oppose MSAs.  Instead, PROPAC favors improved risk adjustment and says that "The likelihood that rates would better reflect risk would be enhanced if Medicare enrollees were required to remain in the MSA option at least for several years."<sup>24</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Likewise, the PPRC recommends that "The enrollment and disenrollment rules of Medicare medical savings account plans should be structured to reduce the potential risk for risk selection.  Examples of restructured rules include a minimum enrollment period of several years in an MSA or requiring beneficiaries to announce their disenrollment from an MSA one or more years in advance."<sup>25</sup>  The PPRC calls for careful monitoring of risk selection and its impact on Medicare costs.  Moreover, says the Commission, Medicare MSA plans should be on a level playing field with other plans.  In this respect, it says, MSA plans should be held to the same standards as other plans in reporting data to Medicare.  Moreover, there should be "no undue legal restriction of managed care plans' ability to offer this product."<sup>26</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Finally, the PPRC notes that the personal choice of an MSA plan is not, of course, a risk free option and estimates that 28 percent of Medicare beneficiaries probably would reach the $3,000 deductible limit that qualifies them for catastrophic coverage under the congressional Medicare reform plan.<sup>27</sup>  Consumers therefore should fully understand the potential costs, including out-of-pocket costs.  Thus, the PPRC recommends:  "Medicare MSA plans should be required to disclose beneficiaries' typical (and potential) out-of pocket spending including exposure to balance billing.  This information should be provided to beneficiaries in a uniform format so that they can easily compare insurers."<sup>28</sup>  It should be noted that in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, health plan cost comparison data, including potential out-of-pocket costs, are made available routinely through private sources to Members of Congress, federal workers, and retirees during the annual "Open Season," the special time of year when these consumers pick and choose among a variety of health plans.
<p>
<b>Observation #5:  Both panels say that Medicare should improve risk adjustment mechanisms to reduce the problems of adverse selection and to control costs in the Medicare program. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1985, Congress established a "risk contracting program" under which health maintenance organizations (HMOs) would receive a per capita payment from Medicare for providing medical services to the elderly.  Through this capitation system, Medicare beneficiaries would be able to enroll in these special HMOs and get extra benefits, while Medicare would be able to realize savings through a fixed payment.  Today, about 8 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in the program.  The government's pricing system is inefficient and does not reflect market conditions.  As PROPAC notes, "The program's capitation rates appear to be too high in some markets and too low in others, discouraging plan participation.  Further, it appears that healthier beneficiaries are likelier than others to enroll, and the payment rates do not adequately reflect this lower risk of illness.  Thus, Medicare may pay more for beneficiaries in its risk program than it would have had they stayed in the fee for service program."<sup>29</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
PROPAC argues that Medicare needs a better risk adjustment method in setting rates to reflect more accurately the differences among individuals in their use of medical services.  Without this effective risk adjustment, especially if capitated plans and traditional fee for service plans are competing in a reformed system, the result could be higher-than-expected costs.  PROPAC suggests that while no ideal risk adjustment mechanism exists, the Secretary of HHS should "implement interim improvements as soon as possible."<sup>30</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In order to meet budgetary targets, Congress included a "fail safe mechanism" in the Medicare reform legislation last year.  This would have meant automatic reductions in payments to doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers if specified budget targets were not met.  The mechanism would rely on the existing apparatus of Medicare price regulations.  With respect to this approach, PROPAC says, "Any fail-safe budget mechanism should include a more effective risk adjustment factor to ensure payment equity between the Medicare capitation and traditional fee for service programs."<sup>31</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Given its limited experience with managed care options, the PPRC agrees substantively with PROPAC on the issue of risk selection:  "Although Medicare's per capita payment should be adjusted to reflect the risk mix of each plan's enrollees, current risk adjustment approaches capture relatively little of any biased selection across plans."<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<b>Observation #6:  Medicare's price controls have their cost.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Physician Payment Review Commission is charged with advising Congress on how to pay doctors the "right price" for their professional services.  Given the complexities of the cumbersome Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS), this is an inherently formidable task.  As the PPRC puts it, with classic understatement:
<blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In hindsight, however, physician payment reform has not been an unqualified success.  In part this reflects inconsistencies within the policy that resulted from compromises made in crafting the reform.  For example, distortions in relative values have been reintroduced owing to the existence of separate volume performance standards (VPSs) for different categories of services:  surgical, primary care and non surgical.  As a result, shifts in relative payments accomplished over the past several years will likely be reversed unless further legislative changes are made.  In addition, some expectations about payment reform's effects may have been unrealistic given the underlying incentives of fee for service medicine.  Despite progress in slowing the rate of growth in physicians services, for instance, overall Medicare expenditures continue to increase at a rate many consider unaffordable.<sup>33</sup></blockquote>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

If Medicare's price control regime governing doctors has not been an "unqualified success," neither has its system governing hospitals.  Since 1983, Congress has imposed a complex system of price controls on hospitals called the Prospective Payment System.  Under this system, hospitals are prospectively reimbursed for medical services; almost 500 of these medical services are grouped according to categories, each called a diagnostic related group (DRG), for which there are fixed payments.  Hospitals may not charge more for the services to Medicare payments, nor may hospitals rebate funds to Medicare enrollees if they can provide a medical service more cheaply.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over the years, the impact of the PPS/DRG system on inpatient care has been to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare's hospital costs.  The economic incentives in the system have reduced the length of inpatient hospital stays, especially for older Medicare patients.  Says PROPAC:  "The rapid fall of Medicare length of stay may partially reflect a trend toward discharging some patients to post-acute settings earlier in the course of their treatment, representing a change in the hospital product.  This has led to concern about how Medicare pays for patients who are discharged from PPS hospitals to inpatient post-acute care providers."<sup>34</sup>  Price controls always encourage a shifting of resources from the controlled to the less controlled or uncontrolled sectors of the economy.  This, of course, invariably generates a demand for an extension of the price controls, an absurd process that distorts economic arrangements even more.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A clear example of hospital gaming has been the broader shifting of Medicare hospital costs since the inception of PPS to the private sector.  Says the Commission:  "During this period, hospitals generally were able to obtain the revenue they needed to cover additional losses from treating Medicare patients by cost shifting to private insurers.  This was accomplished by obtaining payment increases from private payers that exceeded the corresponding cost increases.  As a result, the average payment to cost ratio for private payers went from 116 percent in 1986 to 131 percent in 1992.  Primarily because of cost shifting, hospitals were able to maintain fairly stable total margins, which reflect gains and losses from all payers as well as from non-patient care activities."<sup>35</sup>  In other words, Americans with private insurance pay extra to offset the relatively low reimbursements received by providers from the Medicare program.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Medicare's official advisors have strongly reaffirmed the need to reform the Medicare system.  This is welcome support for necessary changes in the program.  Failure to enact reform means either huge future cuts in Medicare benefits for the elderly or huge tax increases on working families.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Medicare's advisory panels have argued forcefully in their reports that Medicare spending should be slowed, and that the failure to do so threatens Medicare's financial solvency and aggravates the federal budget deficit.  But Medicare's advisers also have endorsed broader consumer choice while declining to oppose medical savings accounts (MSAs).  Moreover, they have made constructive proposals in the technical areas of risk adjustment and information sharing for a modernized Medicare system characterized by consumer choice and competition.  And, finally, they have been forthright in their description of the operations of the system's price regulations.  PROPAC, in particular, has noted that price regulation of hospital services -- long the official recipe for slowing down Medicare's rising costs -- imposes its own costs on workers and their families in the private insurance market.  Obviously, any "reform" of Medicare that relies on clamping down even more tightly on payments to hospitals and physicians will aggravate that cost shifting to the private sector.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reports of these two commissions underscore the need for fundamental reform, and they indicate yet again that there is bipartisan support among experts for that reform.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s, supporters and employees of Legal Services Corporation (LSC) grantees fought efforts to reform federal subsidies to the Corporation, both by mounting a massive lobbying campaign -- paid for in part by federal funds -- and by devising loopholes to avoid the few restrictions that eventually were imposed. Faced with renewed pressure to reform and cut spending in 1995, the LSC responded with a new set of subterfuges and strategies designed to assure business as usual.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The LSC's actions during the past year prove that the legal services network is fundamentally unreformable. In addition, the efforts of LSC grantees to secure new funding sources indicate that subsidized legal services for the poor would continue to be available even without federal aid. It is therefore time to abolish all federal funding for legal services.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the FY 1996 appropriations process, congressional leaders struck a compromise which included reduced, though still significant, funding for the LSC coupled with a promise to end the federal subsidy by 1998. In light of the past year's events, Congress should reaffirm its decision to phase out federal subsidies by 1998 in the FY 1997 Commerce, Justice, State, Judiciary, and Related Agencies appropriations bill.
<P>
<b>Background</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Federally funded civil legal assistance to the poor, first offered under Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, was institutionalized in the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974. From its inception, the Legal Services Corporation, with its 323 local affiliates and 17 support centers, has been viewed as one of the most politicized of federal programs. Liberals have cheered LSC as a force for "social justice," but conservatives have criticized it as offering taxpayer funding for radical activism and expansion of the welfare state.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Though President Ronald Reagan's attempts to abolish the LSC -- the first full-scale effort by conservatives to end the program -- failed in the face of congressional opposition, in the 1980s abuses uncovered by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) and a Senate committee led to some restriction of political activity by grantees. Predictably, legal services programs fought even the most modest attempts to rein in their political activities. Grant recipients, for instance, fought a protracted battle in the federal courts over a regulation forbidding the use of federal funds for congressional redistricting litigation and lobbying. <sup>1</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
With the seating of the 104th Congress in January 1995, the legal services program found itself for the first time under the jurisdiction of a largely conservative Congress. Given the LSC's history, conflict was inevitable. Conservatives sought to eliminate federal funding for both policy and budgetary reasons. LSC grantees are among the leading opponents of welfare reform and chief litigators for left-of-center causes; moreover, the LSC budget, as part of discretionary domestic spending, offered a prime target for almost every plan to balance the federal budget.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite a full-scale lobbying effort launched by LSC grantees and their allies, Congress approved a phased elimination of all federal LSC funding. The omnibus spending bill approved by Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in late April 1996 reduced LSC's budget from $400 million in FY 1995 to $278 million in FY 1996. Further reductions are planned for next year, with an end to federal funding in 1998.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Additionally, the 104th Congress imposed numerous restrictions on the types of cases in which LSC grantees could be involved. The Clinton-appointed Corporation and its grantees responded by returning to the strategy LSC had used effectively in the Reagan years: exploiting all possible legal loopholes. The efforts of legal services lawyers to avoid compliance with new restrictions have reinforced the conviction of many congressional critics that the politicized legal services fund must be eliminated from the federal budget.
<p>
<b>The 104th Congress: Phased Elimination and New Restrictions</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Intent on cutting the deficit in early 1995, the new Congress proposed a recission of $17.1 billion in federal spending, including $15 million from the LSC. Legal services supporters responded with vitriol. In February 1995, for example, American Bar Association President George Bushnell attacked conservative critics of legal services as "reptilian bastards."<sup>2</sup>  Congress and President Clinton eventually agreed to rescind $15 million of the $415 million FY 1995 LSC budget.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The general commitment to achieving a balanced budget placed heavy pressure on moderate Members of the 104th Congress, who otherwise might have spared the LSC, to go along with significant cuts. The May 1995 budget resolution, which passed along party lines, therefore endorsed a phased elimination of LSC spending in which the adjusted funding level of $400 million for 1995 would be reduced to $278 million for FY 1996, $141 million for FY 1997, and zero for FY 1998.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although the budget resolution sets forth the general budget plan for LSC, actual appropriations are made through a separate process. The House Appropriations Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary Subcommittee, chaired by Representative Harold Rogers (R-KY), recommended an FY 1996 funding level of $278 million -- the amount specified by the House budget resolution. House conservatives, however, mindful of how legal services groups might thwart welfare reform and other key elements of their agenda, advocated an immediate end to all LSC funding. The fact that the Legal Services Corporation Act had not been reauthorized since its expiration in 1980 gave LSC's foes an opportunity to use House rules to challenge funding for an unauthorized program.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Within this framework, the House Republican leadership met with the interested parties and struck an agreement to protect legal services appropriations from a floor challenge with the further understanding that the terms of a planned reauthorization bill would be added as an amendment, or rider, to LSC appropriations. The reauthorization legislation then under consideration included elimination of the LSC coupled with block grant funding to the states, to be used to provide legal services, and far stricter prohibitions on political activities than in prior legal services legislation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In mid-1995, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, chaired by Representative George W. Gekas (R-PA), held hearings and voted out a bill containing many of the needed reforms, including elimination of the LSC and the block granting of legal services funds. However, the full House Judiciary Committee -- reflecting both its more liberal membership and the influence of the organized bar -- narrowly passed a number of amendments extending the life of the program and increasing its spending levels. This new bill, unacceptable to House conservatives as well as to the Republican leadership, was never brought to the floor for a vote.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the Senate, Phil Gramm (R-TX), a longtime critic of the LSC, chaired the Appropriations subcommittee that reported out an even lower funding level for LSC than had been reported by the comparable subcommittee in the House: $210 million. That figure survived a vote by the full committee, but an effort on the Senate floor -- led by Senator Pete Domenici (R-NM), aided by the votes of 15 other Republican Senators and most Democrats -- narrowly defeated the Gramm proposal, replacing it with a much higher funding level of $340 million.<sup>3</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A House-Senate conference committee agreed to $278 million for LSC along with restrictions on lobbying, prison litigation, class action suits, illegal alien representation, and lawsuits against welfare reform, but President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill on December 19, 1995. The LSC appropriations thus became part of a long series of continuing resolutions which contained none of the proposed new restrictions, leaving legal services programs free to continue many of the same ideological and political activities that had motivated the 104th Congress to cut the program.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On April 24, 1996, the President signed a new appropriations bill which reduced LSC funding to $278 million, the figure reported out by the original House-Senate conference committee. This bill also eliminates all funding for LSC's 17 support centers, some of which have engaged in litigation supporting the provision of government services to illegal aliens and opposing parental consent requirements for adolescents seeking abortions. These major cuts in the LSC budget are clear victories for congressional conservatives.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nearly as significant as the cuts in LSC funding are the restrictions placed on the types of cases LSC grantees may pursue. Grantees no longer may file challenges to welfare reform, for example, and class action lawsuits -- traditionally a major weapon in the grantee arsenal -- now may be filed only with the approval of the Corporation. Moreover, legal services lawyers are barred from representing prisoners, illegal aliens, and public housing residents being evicted for drug-related crimes.
<p>
<b>Replacing Federal Funds and Avoiding New Restrictions</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the fight over the future of legal services, the LSC empire's 4,000-plus attorneys, many with activist backgrounds, organized rallies, lobbied Congress, wrote op-eds, held demonstrations, and undertook direct-mail campaigns. A similar lobbying effort to counteract the Reagan Administration's effort to eliminate the LSC in the 1980s was investigated by the GAO, which found that federal funds intended for the provision of legal services to the poor were diverted to the LSC's political "survival campaign."<sup>4</sup>  Perhaps even more significant than their lobbying efforts was the fact that grantees sought additional non-federal funding and sought to create new loopholes by which to avoid federal restrictions.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Federal budget numbers do not begin to reflect the actual funding available for legal services programs. The 323 programs funded by LSC also receive in excess of $250 million a year from other sources, including foundations, state governments, legal fee awards, and the organized bar's Interest on Lawyers Trust Account programs. Without exception, in each of the last ten years, combined funding for legal services grantees from non-LSC sources has increased.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Efforts to raise non-federal revenues have increased significantly over the past year. According to the LSC, at least 27 states are studying ways to provide additional funding for legal services programs.<sup>5</sup>  Typically, most proposals seek an increase in filing fees for civil cases, with the proceeds earmarked for legal services:
<p><ul>
<li>In May 1995, Tennessee increased the filing fee for civil cases by $1 and designated the increased revenue for legal services programs.
<p>
<li>In February 1996, a bill was introduced in the Maryland legislature to raise $4.5 million for programs, including legal services, by adding a surcharge to civil case filing fees.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li>In New Jersey, a proposal to increase fees for filing civil motions from $135 to $160 was endorsed by the New Jersey Bar Association and the head of Legal Services of New Jersey. The entire $25 increase in filing fees is slated to be turned over to Legal Services of New Jersey. If the proposal is enacted, legal services will receive a projected $8 million increase in funding.<sup>7</sup>
</ul><p>
<b>New Loopholes</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because President Clinton has signed the appropriations bill, the new restrictions on legal services are now in effect. Many of the activist lawyers who lead legal services programs resent these regulations, which will bar a wide range of controversial activities undertaken by LSC-funded lawyers in the past, including lobbying, class action suits, and the representation of illegal aliens, drug dealers, and other criminals.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even more upsetting to opponents of reform, the new prohibitions would close the largest loophole in the legal services program by forbidding the use of non-LSC funds to support activities for which LSC funds also may not be used. In the past, legal services lawyers could evade virtually any congressionally imposed restriction by using, or claiming to use, non-LSC funds which are not subject to this limitation. Critics of legal services note that money is fungible, as is a lawyer's time. The absence of mandatory timekeeping, along with the fact that case files are closed to outside monitoring, made it easy for legal services programs to use federal funds for restricted activities.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The new restrictions have left legal services activists looking for new ways to continue their controversial activities. Using a variation of a strategy tried in the 1980s, grantees are seeking to evade the restrictions by setting up new closely affiliated but legally separate entities. A 1985 GAO investigation determined that such affiliated groups often engaged in activities prohibited to LSC grantees and that the relationships between these two sets of groups were so close that LSC should consider them one group for purposes of complying with restrictions.<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Growing numbers of legal services groups have announced they will refuse LSC funds because of pending restrictions. Foremost among these are Community Legal Services (CLS) of Philadelphia; the Legal Aid Society of Santa Clara, California; three Washington State grantees; and Greater Boston, Massachusetts, Legal Services. The strategy is simple: Such "former" grantees will continue to receive bar support, private funds, and state support for soon-to-be-restricted activities; meanwhile, new organizations will apply for and receive LSC funds to use in non-prohibited cases. Many of the new organizations have been created by attorneys affiliated with the "former" grantees, which would be free to handle political and ideological cases.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The possibility that former LSC grantees and new grantees will share office space and even staff means that, once again, it will be difficult to ascertain whether federal funds are being misused. Early signs of close ties between former and current grantees, however, are already apparent:
<p><ul>
<li>The Philadelphia Legal Assistance Center, for example, was formed by 12 lawyers from Community Legal Services to assume CLS's non-prohibited cases, setting up shop in the same building as CLS.<sup>9</sup>
<p><li>Members of the Legal Aid Society of Santa Clara's executive committee opted to refuse LSC funds and set up a new organization to take LSC funds. LAS Vice President Elizabeth Shivell explained the tactic in an unguarded moment: "If [Congress] can screw people with technicalities, we can unscrew them with technicalities. That's why we're lawyers and not social workers. Two can play this game."  A bar publication reported that many poverty lawyers worried that her remarks could cause trouble with Congress.<sup>10</sup>
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A top LSC staff member, Robert Echols, was quoted as describing the rash of new groups as a perfectly appropriate approach.<sup>11</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Legal Services Corporation -- run by a Clinton-appointed board and run by senior-level staff with strong ties to the groups they are charged with regulating -- has provided guidance to its programs on this issue. In a December 1995 memo to its 323 field programs on "Applicability of Restrictions to Interrelated Organizations," LSC set forth the factors to be considered in determining whether one group controls another, thereby subjecting both groups to the new restrictions. Among the eight criteria used to determine control are:
<p><ul>
<li>Any overlap of officers, directors, or managers;
<p>
<li>Contractual and financial relationships;
<p>
<li>A close identity of interest; and
<p>
<li>A history of relationships among organizations.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The LSC memo pointed out that any determination as to whether two groups are subject to common control would consider the "totality of circumstances," with the "presence or absence of any one or more of these factors" not necessarily determinative. Translation: LSC staff, with close ties to LSC grantees, will be the sole judges of whether two groups sharing office space, staff, and other resources are subject to common control, and therefore to the new restrictions.

<p>
<b>Other New Loopholes: "Restriction" of Drug Cases and the Cohen Amendment</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Legal services lawyers have incurred the bipartisan wrath of Congress by representing public housing tenants in drug-related eviction cases. LSC-funded lawyers, for example, thwarted attempts by then-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp in 1991 to expedite evictions to clean up the serious drug problem in public housing.<sup>12</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, the poor -- those whom these programs ostensibly are designed to help -- have lined up almost uniformly in opposition to legal services and in favor of expediting drug evictions. In a major case now pending in New York City, representatives of New York's 500,000 public housing tenants have entered a court case on the side of their landlord, the New York Housing Authority, to support expedited drug evictions. On the other side is the Legal Aid Society, an LSC grantee once chaired by the Corporation's current President, Alex Forger.<sup>13</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Faced with the likelihood of tough new restrictions imposed by Congress, the LSC board made a virtue out of necessity: It promulgated a new regulation purporting to restrict representation in drug-related eviction cases. This regulation appeared in the <I>Federal Register</I> on April 1, 1996. While appearing to crack down on one of the most indefensible of legal services activities, however, the new regulation actually is filled with loopholes.
<p><ul>
<li>It allows family members who knew about and benefited financially from drug activity to be represented, provided they are not charged with a crime.
<p>
<li>It specifically allows legal services lawyers to use non-LSC funds to represent the drug dealer.
<p>
<li>But nothing in the regulation prohibits legal services lawyers from filing actions to challenge attempts by federal, state, and local governments to expedite drug-related evictions from public housing.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Proponents of legal services have tried to minimize this issue by claiming that such cases are rare; critics, on the other hand, point to the action against Secretary Kemp and the case pending in New York City to show that legal services' involvement delays drug-related evictions, thereby harming hundreds of thousands of low-income tenants.<sup>14</sup>  In short, the new regulation offers the perfect metaphor for the claim that the legal services program finally is reforming itself: While doing nothing to deter a legal services lawyer from continued involvement in drug-related evictions, it gives LSC a pretext for telling Congress that it has cracked down on such representation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the LSC's obvious failure to follow the new restrictions, the legal services empire scored a major victory in 1996 with the inclusion of the Cohen amendment in the omnibus spending bill. This amendment, sponsored by Senator William Cohen (R-ME), allows grantees to comment on legislation and participate in legislative rulemaking. The effect of the Cohen amendment is to provide a major loophole for legal services lawyers disposed to engage in lobbying activities.
<p>
<b>Conclusion: Looking to the 105th Congress</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although LSC escaped total defunding in 1995, it lost nearly one-third of its federal appropriation. Fearing that Congress would impose several important limits on grantee activities, the LSC, its grantees, and their affiliates worked to devise new strategies to avoid complying with such restrictions. As a result, conservatives in Congress remain determined to push for phased elimination of all federal LSC funding.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House Republican leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached last summer, is expected to ensure that the Rules Committee will not protect LSC from a point of order when the full House considers the FY 1997 appropriations bill containing LSC funding. This could open the opportunity for the House to "zero out" LSC. So far, there is no reliable head count, but it should be remembered that whatever happens, the Senate -- given last year's performance -- is not likely to go along.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The major battle in Congress therefore will be over whether the budget resolution's FY 1997 figure of $141 million for LSC will be followed. This would represent a sharp cut from the $278 million voted for FY 1996. If Congress approves $141 million, the stage will be set for the final showdown on legal services. The 105th Congress, to be elected this November, will decide whether it has the political will to vote for the final installment of the budget resolution plan for LSC: zero support from the American taxpayer by FY 1998.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reducing LSC's appropriation by one-third while placing significant restrictions on the allowable activities of LSC grantees, the 104th Congress took major steps to reduce the tendency of grantees to pursue frivolous and politically charged lawsuits at taxpayer's expense. LSC grantees responded by attempting to blunt the impact of congressional efforts, primarily by seeking new, non-federal revenue sources or by restructuring their organizations to circumvent the new regulations. Through these actions, grantees have shown once again that legal services cannot be reformed. It is past time for Congress to eliminate all federal funding for this program.

<title>Time For a Bipartisan Reform of Public Housing - Heritage</title>

<center><h3>TIME FOR A BIPARTISAN REFORM OF PUBLIC HOUSING: SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION</h3>

<P>
<B>CISNEROS AGREES TO DESEGREGATE HUD HOUSING PROGRAM</B>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Under the guidance of U.S. District Court Judge Marvin J. Garbis, in April 1996, HUD finally agreed to the terms of a settlement of a January 1995 desegregation suit (<I>Thompson vs. HUD, et al</I>., Civil No. MJG 95-309) brought against it by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland on behalf of several African-American families living at Lafayette Gardens, a decrepit HUD-supported public housing project operated by the Baltimore Public Housing Authority.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	According to the <I>Baltimore Sun</I>, "The suit alleged that the city, the Housing Authority of Baltimore City, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development illegally segregated black public housing tenants for six decades, which the defendants deny. It said they would 'rebuild segregation for generations' and perpetuate poverty if allowed to redevelop the high rise sites as public housing."<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	In April 1996, HUD agreed to a $300 million settlement under which, among other promises, it would tear down several of the dilapidated, segregated public housing projects and replace them with 814 new, low-rise public housing units. Money earmarked for 150 of these units could be redirected to vouchers if Congress concurs. HUD also would provide vouchers to allow another 1,342 families to move into better neighborhoods. In addition, 664 of the proposed 814 new public housing units or vouchers could be made available for homeownership, partly under a resuscitated version of former Secretary Kemp's HOPE program. Traditional public housing is nowhere part of the court-supervised desegregation settlement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although in principle the settlement is a significant endorsement of the Reagan-Kemp empowerment policies of the 1980s, in practice the implementation details are remarkably coercive and would deny the winning tenants the right to exercise their choice in using the voucher.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Specifically, the assisted tenants, who are almost exclusively African-American, can use their vouchers only if they agree to move into a "non-impacted" area. In HUD-speak, non-impacted areas are defined census tracts, mostly in the surrounding suburbs and predominantly white in racial composition. In response to suburban concerns that the federal government will be forcibly relocating poor, inner-city blacks to their communities, HUD has established annual quotas under which the relocation program will be conducted. For example, only 60 black families per year will be permitted to move into neighboring Baltimore County in each of the next six years until the 360-family quota of African-Americans for the county is exhausted in 2002.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Although dramatic in cost and scope, the Baltimore settlement is not the first of its kind, and is not likely to be the last, unless Congress abandons its six-decade obsession with public housing.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>
<a name="ahs"><b>WHAT SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Although the perception within Congress is that there is a dearth of affordable housing available to the poor, the facts indicate otherwise. The table below, prepared by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, demonstrates clearly that a substantial portion of the U.S. rental stock is available at rents well within the range of the resources available to the typical HUD voucher recipient.
<p><center>

<tr  align="center">
<th>Total Occupied Units</th><th>	33,472	</th></tr></table>			
</center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	As the table indicates, there are 33,472,000 occupied rental units in the United States. In 1993, the most recent year for which such data are available, the vacancy rate calculated by the Bureau of the Census was 7.4 percent of the rental stock, roughly as it has been for most of this decade. This means approximately 2,674,000 additional units were vacant. Further, the number of affordable vacant units available from the private sector, estimated at 1.3 million units, is nearly equal to the entire stock of public housing units now in existence. With the private sector able to provide these units at rental rates below either the partial cost ($481) or the full cost ($935) of public housing, one is hard-pressed to explain Congress's long-standing bipartisan obsession with this failed approach.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	It should be noted that the vacancy rate is higher, and housing therefore more available, within urban areas, reflecting the long-term depopulation trends within those communities as more and more Americans choose not to make their homes in cities. In 1993 when the overall vacancy rate was 7.4 percent, the rate inside Metropolitan Statistical Areas was 7.6 percent, while that outside MSAs was 6.4 percent. Thus, it should come as no surprise that 89 percent of voucher recipients are able to find suitable, qualified, affordable rental housing from the private sector.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The claimed shortage of affordable housing is one of the more popular rationales used by the public housing industry and its defenders to justify pouring billions of dollars into renovation, modernization, and new construction. Indeed, so great is this obsession that for years Congress has forbidden HUD to tear down any public housing unit, no matter how dilapidated, unless it first agrees to replace it with a new unit. Although both the House and the Senate propose to repeal this absurd and long-standing restriction, apologists for public housing still go to great lengths to misconstrue the actual state of affairs, as the House Banking Subcommittee report demonstrates with its creative interpretation of a GAO finding. On the matter of affordability and availability, the GAO says that:
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Generally, the lower the vacancy rate in an area, the more difficult it will be for assisted households to find alternative housing. In the New York City housing market, for example, where about 11 percent of the nation's public housing stock is located, the vacancy rate is less than half the national average, making alternative housing more difficult to find.<sup>3</sup> 
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Seven months later, the House Subcommittee on Housing had this to say on the same matter in a paragraph referencing the GAO's findings:
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Also, for vouchers to succeed, housing must be available, and availability is very much market specific. For example, the vacancy rate in markets such as New York City, where about 11 percent of the nation's public housing stock is located, is less than one half the national rate. Providing a voucher in this area would be useless.<sup>4</sup> 
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Despite the difficulties that more than 50 years of rent control and rent stabilization have created for the New York City rental housing market, it is significant that HUD has a 62 percent success rate with vouchers and certificates.<sup>5</sup>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Today our federal [work force] is 200,000 employees smaller than it was the day I took office as President."

<p>-- President Bill Clinton, State of the Union Address, January 23, 1996

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
President Clinton wants to convince the American people he has pared back the bloated federal work force. The American people certainly have every reason to resent the large number of federal bureaucrats whose apparent mission is to turn their daily lives into the sort of nightmares described in the novels of Franz Kafka. These bureaucrats include auditors from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scrutinizing tax returns, regulators from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) undermining productive enterprises, and agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) trying to seize the guns of law-abiding citizens. Reducing the numbers of these bureaucrats should and will be popular with the American people.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The disturbing thing is that most of the eliminated positions cited by President Clinton are not coming from the IRS, the EPA, the ATF, or similar regulatory or enforcement agencies. The vast majority of the positions being eliminated belong to the people who helped win the Persian Gulf War. In short, most are from the Department of Defense. For example:<ul>

<p><li>Some 60 percent of the 200,000 eliminated positions cited by the President come from a single department, the Department of Defense.<sup>1</sup><p><li>Personnel reductions at the Pentagon are even more severe than the President would have Americans believe. The personnel reductions cited by President Clinton include only federal civilian employees, including those at the Department of Defense, but not active duty or reserve component military personnel. In fact, total federal employment, including both civilian and military personnel, as of the end of fiscal 1997 will have dropped by 849,000 positions from levels prevailing at the end of FY 1992.<sup>2</sup><p><li>Of all federal civilian and military positions lost since the end of FY 1992, over 89 percent (almost 760,000) will have come solely from the Department of Defense (see <a href="bgup278c1.gif">Chart 1</a>).

<p><li>President Clinton's cuts in defense jobs have not been limited to the public sector (see <a href="bgup278c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). Defense industry jobs by the end of FY 1997 will have dropped by 795,000 positions from levels prevailing at the end of FY 1992.<sup>3</sup><p><li>In 1997, there will be 1.5 million fewer defense jobs (including those in the military, the civil service, and industry) than in 1992 (see <a href="bgup278c2.gif">Chart 2</a>).<sup>4</sup>  In total, defense sector employment is down by 22 percent. Meanwhile, IRS employment has dropped by only 6 percent, ATF positions have dropped by less than 5 percent, and EPA positions have <i>increased</i> by over 2 percent (see <a href="bgup278c3.gif">Chart 3</a>).</ul>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
President Clinton's federal employment policy is unbalanced. One department, the Department of Defense, bears a disproportionate share of personnel reductions. The President's policies punish defense employees in the private sector as well. The American people do not need federal bureaucrats from agencies such as the IRS, EPA, and ATF watching their every move and telling them how to live their lives. But they do need the sort of skilled people that contributed to victory over Iraq in the Persian Gulf War.
<p>
<b>RESTORING BALANCE TO FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT POLICY</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
To restore balance to federal employment policy, the Clinton Administration should:<ul>

<p><li>Freeze military personnel reductions at the level recommended by the Clinton Administration in its 1993 "Bottom-Up Review" of defense policy. This amounts to about 2.4 million positions, including active troops and reserves. A military of this size should be adequate to handle the nation's future military requirements. However, within these limits, the Pentagon should be flexible in dividing the number of billets for active and reserve forces. The Administration should decrease personnel strength in the Army National Guard and increase the number of active duty personnel, who are better suited to addressing the short-notice conflicts likely to arise in the post-Cold War world. Moreover, since the Navy's power projection capabilities are particularly suited to the post-Cold War security needs of the U.S., the Administration should ensure that the number of naval personnel is relatively higher than the number for other services.

<p><li>Limit further reductions in civilian positions at the Department of Defense to those achieved through privatization efforts. The current excessive reliance on public sector civilian employees to perform such routine services as depot maintenance of equipment for the Department of Defense and the military services should be reduced. Current law requires that public employees perform no less than 60 percent of this work. The private sector certainly is more efficient in performing maintenance and other services. Savings can be achieved by privatizing a significant number of services and allowing defense contractors greater flexibility to do the work. Additional civilian work force reductions outside the privatization effort, however, should be limited. This will ensure that civilian support and management positions within the Department of Defense are adequate to meet the needs of the military force required for U.S. security in the post-Cold War world. 

<p><li>Increase the Department of Defense procurement budget. Procurement funding -- the money the Pentagon spends to buy new weapons -- has fallen by more than two-thirds in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1985. This has caused the loss of over 1.3 million defense industry jobs since the employment peak in 1987. Annual real increases in the procurement budget, which provides much of the money for defense industry jobs, will reverse this trend and help preserve the defense industry jobs that are necessary for a strong national defense. These increases are needed to replace aging weapons and equipment that will become obsolete by early in the next decade.

<p><li>Concentrate federal work force reductions within non-defense departments. Further reductions in non-defense civilian positions in the federal government should result from a policy of eliminating unnecessary and outdated federal programs and agencies. Putting caps or ceilings on the federal civilian work force does little to reduce the size or scope of government. In fact, it may lead to the poor delivery of government services by failing to distinguish between successful and failed federal programs. Instead, work force reductions should come from eliminating unnecessary agencies, consolidating similar programs, devolving authority to the states, simplifying taxes, and pursuing a policy of deregulation. The Heritage Foundation's budget plan, <i>Rolling Back Government</i>, would reduce the federal government from its current level of 14 cabinet-level departments to five.<sup>5</sup>  The plan also would reduce the non-defense federal work force by approximately 10 percent over the next five years (FY 1997-2001).</ul><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Reducing the federal work force is an appropriate goal. The American people should demand the elimination of wasteful bureaucracies. But cutting into America's fighting force and then claiming credit for downsizing the government is not only misleading, but damaging to national security. In essence, Clinton's federal employment policy is a cloak hiding the Administration's policy of weakening America's military strength.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Now that the true impact of President Clinton's federal employment policy has been revealed, Congress should set about the task of restoring balance to the federal work force. It should limit further reductions in the defense sector and focus instead on dealing with the real cause of waste in government: the bloated non-defense federal bureaucracy.

(Updating <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 805, "The U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement: Keeping Up the Managed    Trade Agenda," January 24, 1991.) 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The Clinton Administration and some Members of Congress argue that the decades old U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement has helped save America's ailing semiconductor industry and increase previously slumping sales in Japan. They are wrong. The semiconductor agreement, signed in 1986 by the Reagan Administration, nearly destroyed America's computer industry, forced higher prices on American consumers, and has had little to do with the U.S. industry's rebound in this crucial technology. The President and Congress should let this agreement expire as scheduled on July 31, 1996.

<p>
<b>The 1986 Agreement</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The United States and Japan agreed in 1986 to monitor foreign semiconductor market share in Japan. There were two reason for this. First, the U.S. industry complained that Japan was protecting its semiconductor market from foreign competition. Thus, they argued, the U.S. was not selling as many semiconductors in Japan as it could. Second, the U.S. industry argued that Japanese semiconductor manufacturers were selling these products in the U.S. at prices below their cost of production.1  The result was the 1986 trade agreement with Japan, which sought to monitor both the level of foreign semiconductor market share in Japan and the prices of Japanese semiconductors sold in the U.S. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Some supporters of the semiconductor agreement argue that it established a "guarantee" by which foreign semiconductor manufacturers are granted a 20 percent market share in Japan. If foreign market share falls below the 20 percent figure, the U.S. and others can impose trade sanctions on Japan. Yet the 1986 agreement makes no such guarantee. In fact, the market share number is based on a secret side letter that the Japanese government supposedly sent the U.S., stating that it would work to help American companies achieve higher market share in Japan. The U.S. treated the Japanese pledge as binding, but the Japanese were more ambiguous, preferring to make it in private. The Japanese government refuses to confirm the existence of this side letter.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Unsatisfied with America's slow progress on increasing market share in Japan, the Reagan Administration had imposed some $4 billion in penalties on the Japanese industry in the mid-1980s. Most of these penalties were suspended in 1986. The Reagan Administration, however, applied some $165 million in retaliatory duties to Japanese imports in 1987. The Japanese were compelled to raise prices for their semiconductors sold in the U.S. in order to avoid the imposition of special tariffs and duties resulting from U.S. antidumping investigations. As a result, Japanese computer chips cost American computer manufacturers 30 percent to 40 percent more in the late 1980s than before the agreement. Personal computer prices shot up drastically in the late 1980s, almost destroying America's competitiveness in this crucial high-tech product area.

<p>
<b>The 1991 Agreement</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
When the semiconductor agreement expired in 1991, it was clear that foreign market share had grown only marginally in Japan, from about 9 percent in 1986 to only 14 percent. Nevertheless, the Bush Administration sought to extend the agreement for five more years. This time, the strategy was different. Rather than focus on numerical targets and guaranteed market shares, the Administration backed off the claim that the 20 percent market share number was a guarantee which, if not met, could invoke sanctions. The Administration sought to include a reference to the 20 percent foreign market share figure, but both it and the Japanese government specified that this figure was not a guarantee. The 1991 agreement states:<blockquote>

	<p>The Government of Japan recognizes that the U.S. semiconductor industry expects that the foreign market share will grow to more than 20 percent of the Japanese market by the end of 1992 and considers that this can be realized. The two Governments agree that the above statements constitute neither a guarantee, a ceiling, nor a floor on the foreign market share.<sup>2</sup></blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Thus, the 1991 agreement should have removed any doubt that the 20 percent foreign market share figure was to be used as a benchmark in measuring the openness of the Japanese market to foreign semiconductors. Yet, despite the text in the negotiated agreement, both the U.S. government and U.S. semiconductor industry continued to focus almost exclusively on this number, leading many economists to call this a managed trade agreement. Even so, the agreement paved the way for U.S. and Japanese firms to enter joint ventures. Both the U.S. and Japanese agreed not to enforce strict antitrust laws which could stifle such relationships, and to sponsor meetings between U.S. and Japanese companies to arrange such relationships. These joint ventures were beginning to occur, even without the agreement, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They would continue to occur without the agreement. After the 1991 agreement, instead of promoting the use of numerical targets, the Bush Administration focused on private sector solutions. The foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market has increased from 14 percent in 1991 to more than 29 percent today.

<p>
<b>The Cause of U.S. Success </b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The U.S. semiconductor industry is more competitive and prosperous today than it was before the U.S.-Japan agreement. It now is the world's largest producer of semiconductors. The question is: How much does this success have to do with the agreement, and how much is the result of market forces and the sound business decisions of private companies?  The answer is simple: America's renewed success in Japan has occurred because of private sector initiatives by U.S. and Japanese companies to work together, and despite the U.S. government's managed trade policies.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The 1991 agreement emphasized the use of "long-term relationships between Japanese semiconductor purchasers and foreign capital-affiliated producers, including joint product development with Japanese customers."  This statement gave rise to an avalanche of trans-Pacific strategic alliances or joint ventures between U.S. and Japanese semiconductor companies. Some of these alliances could have been challenged under America's antiquated antitrust laws. But the emphasis on joint ventures in the agreement eased the concerns of many U.S. companies seeking partnerships with Japanese firms. In 1991, for example, there were fewer than a dozen such partnerships between U.S. and Japanese companies. Three years later, in 1994, there were more than three dozen.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Located in Japan, many of these alliances gave U.S. firms direct access to Japan's complex distribution system, advanced manufacturing techniques, and new and innovative marketing techniques. Moreover, they allowed U.S. and Japanese firms to pool resources, thereby reducing the research and development costs of new and advanced semiconductor products, and helped U.S. firms gain access to the Japanese semiconductor market. U.S.-Japanese joint ventures and strategic alliances therefore are the principal reason not only for America's regaining its role as the largest producer of semiconductors in the world, but also for America's increased market share in Japan.

<p>
<b>Misguided Focus on Market Share </b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The semiconductor agreement is both a failure and an unwise policy. It is based on a fundamental misconception about trade: that because Country A's market share in Country B is significantly lower than Country A's global market share, Country B must have a closed market.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
This assumption is fallacious. Japan has 47 percent of the world market in semiconductors, excluding North America, but only 23 percent market share in semiconductors in North America. Japan also has 33 percent of the world market share in microprocessors, excluding North America, but only 6 percent share of the microprocessor market in North America. Few would argue that the North American (including the U.S.) semiconductor or microprocessor market is closed to Japan. American computer companies dominate the U.S. market because they are more competitive than the Japanese, not because the U.S. government protects them from competition.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
There is a danger that extending the semiconductor agreement could cause the U.S. to be held to the same standard of market openness as it expects of Japan. If other countries were to decide that America is closed, they could retaliate by imposing tariffs and duties on America's exports, further harming U.S. businesses and threatening American jobs. Under these circumstances, the U.S. would have no ground on which to stand against foreign retaliation.

<p>
<b>Objectives Fulfilled</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Even if the semiconductor agreement's goal was to give foreigners a 20 percent share of the Japanese semiconductor market, as its supporters contend, this goal has been exceeded, thanks largely to U.S.-Japanese joint ventures and strategic alliances. Today the foreign market share for semiconductors in Japan is over 29 percent. Moreover, while total foreign sales of semiconductors in Japan in 1986 amounted to only $900 million, foreign sales today are worth over $6 billion -- a sevenfold increase.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The Clinton Administration believes that the recent success of America's semiconductor industry is the result of the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement. It is not. The U.S. semiconductor industry is successful today because it sought joint ventures with Japanese firms which gave American companies access to the Japanese market, advanced manufacturing techniques, and reduced research and development costs. The semiconductor agreement sets a bad precedent by focusing on market share numbers. If other countries applied the same policy to the U.S., many of America's exports could faced increased tariffs abroad. The President should let the agreement expire.

<p><li>While the U.S. International Trade Commission found that many Japanese companies were selling their semiconductors in the U.S. at prices below their production costs, there is little evidence that this was done to undercut the prices of U.S. producers. Instead, it was more the result of intensive competition within Japan and a drop in demand for personal computers in the mid-1980s, which caused the prices for semiconductors to fall rapidly. In order to cut their losses, many Japanese semiconductor firms which had overproduced and had bulging inventories sought to cut their losses by quickly selling off their stockpiles of semiconductors.

Defenders of big government would have us believe that Congress and the President have shown tremendous fiscal restraint in recent years and that this Congress's efforts to reduce spending further can be achieved only by cutting muscle and bone. But waste, fraud, and abuse still abound in many government programs. Consider the following recently revealed examples:<p>

<b>Doing Well by Doing Good. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Baltimore Public Housing Authority's operations are funded largely by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) -- $52 million in operating subsidies for FY 1994 -- and the PHA has a waiting list of 25,000 poor families in line for housing assistance. Yet the Baltimore authority was found to have improperly used the public's money by buying eight new Chevy Blazers as take-home cars for its top managers, hiring a high-bid security firm that employed 29 convicted felons, and spending more than $25 million of building repair funds on no-bid contracts to contractors, including some who were friends and relatives of Authority employees. HUD asked that $725,000 be returned because of inflated costs or work never completed.<sup>1</sup>  Despite this record of mismanagement, HUD just awarded the same housing authority $115 million to construct 338 new apartment units for the poor as part of a court-imposed desegregation settlement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Who's in Charge:  Kevin E. Marchman, HUD's Assistant Secretary-Designate for Public and Indian Housing, (202) 708-0950.
<p>
<b>They All Threatened to Leave. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to the U.S. General Accounting Office and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 95 percent of the bonuses recently granted by the managers of the U.S. Export-Import Bank to their employees were "improper and excessive" and cost the taxpayer as much as $1 million in overpayments.<sup>2</sup>  According to the GAO, 1995 bonuses were granted to 200 of the Bank's 448 employees, but only 10 of the 200 employees were actually eligible to receive the money. Ex-Im's bonus abuse was uncovered a year earlier when a GAO audit revealed that just five government agencies accounted for 94 percent of these special retention bonuses. Although the Ex-Im Bank had the smallest work force of the five agencies reviewed, it accounted for 25 percent of all bonuses government-wide, and the GAO auditors noted that many of these awards "did not appear to comply with the statutory requirement."  Whereas the Department of Defense granted such bonuses to only 0.03 percent of its work force in 1994, 21 percent of Ex-Im employees received such bonuses that year, and nearly 45 percent received them in 1995. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although the acting head of the Ex-IM Bank was stripped of his authority to grant bonuses by the Office of Personnel Management, his April 1996 recess appointment to the top Bank post by President Clinton was accompanied by the reinstatement of bonus-granting authority. And although Ex-Im Bank officials have argued that they are merely continuing Bush Administration practices, the GAO audit indicates that no such bonuses were granted by the Ex-Im Bank during those years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Who's in Charge:  Martin Kamarck, President and Chairman-Designate of the Export-Import Bank, (202) 565-3500.
<p>

<b>Deadbeat Schools. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Students attending proprietary trade schools are eligible for federal student loans, and these loans have experienced excessively high default rates over the past several years, hitting a high of 41.2 percent in 1990. Included among the hundreds of proprietary schools that were selected for direct federal student loans are the California Medical School of Shiatsu, the Hypnosis Motivation Institute, the Trend Benders Academy, the Milpitas Electrolysis and Thermolysis College, and the Las Vegas Gaming and Technical School. Although improvements have been made in reducing the default rates at proprietary schools during both the Bush and Clinton Administrations, students from more than 200 of these schools have current default rates in excess of 40 percent, and these schools are still eligible for federal student loans.<sup>3</sup> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Who's in Charge:  Deputy Assistant Secretary Elizabeth M. Hicks, Office of Student Financial Assistance Programs, U.S. Department of Education, (202) 260-6536.

American consumers pay a heavy price to subsidize the sugar barons, of whom some of the richest are foreign citizens. The brothers Alfonso Jr. (Alfie) and Jose (Pepe) Fanjul, immigrants from Cuba but citizens of Spain, possess a fortune estimated at over $500 million. This fortune includes several Florida sugar mills, 170,000 acres of cane in south Florida, and another 240,000 acres of land in the Dominican Republic. But as "domestic" growers, they are entitled to the sugar import protection enforced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which adds about 8 cents a pound to what the American consumer pays for sugar and about $65 million to the annual income of the Fanjuls.<sup>4</sup>  As if this were not enough government help, the Fanjuls' other business interests have benefited from federal, state, and local affirmative action programs that provide minority set-asides for qualified firms. For example, the Fanjuls' investment firm, FAIC Securities, enjoys the right to market the debt of Florida municipalities and such government-sponsored enterprises as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Banks.

Years of financial mismanagement have left the District of Columbia's government bankrupt and D.C. officials coming to Congress for yet another taxpayer bailout of hundreds of millions of dollars. So serious is the shortfall that clinics for the poor have been closed, teachers furloughed, snow covered streets unplowed, and police cars left unrepaired. But despite the fiscal crisis, Lloyd Arrington, Jr., President of the city-funded Economic Development Finance Corporation (EDFC), was able to maintain most of his costly perks despite the poor performance of the EDFC. Created in 1986 to encourage business development in the District of Columbia, and provided with $6.75 million in funds to loan to promising businesses, the EDFC and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Neighborhood Economic Development Corporation, made only 17 loans through 1994, or less than two loans per year. Although nine were in default or charged off as of 1994, the audit<sup>5</sup> reported that EDFC's President Arrington received a bonus of $17,000 on top of his $70,000 salary, another $1,650 to pay for parking, and $600 in "improper expenditures" for rented formal wear, dinners, and entertainment. Nonetheless, the audit does indicate that progress toward fiscal restraint is being made:  The EFDC's annual spending on flowers, which had hit a high of more than $2,000 per year in 1989 and 1990, had been phased out to zero by 1993.

<a href="fyi101t5.gif">Table 5</a>: Recipients of  U.S. Foreign Aid and Their Votes Against U.S. Supported Issues in the U.N.<br>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last year, Congress tried to cut the U.S.  foreign aid budget as part of its plan to reduce wasteful government spending and balance the federal budget deficit.  Moreover, both houses of Congress passed legislation that would have abolished the Agency for International Development, the U.S.  agency responsible for most of America's $13 billion foreign aid program, along with most of its functions.  Because the Clinton Administration fought these proposals, Congress was unable to make more significant cuts in foreign aid or eliminate these wasteful government functions.
The Clinton Administration says foreign aid supports America's interests overseas.  It claims, for example, that U.S.  aid helps America gain influence with countries around the world and that these countries generally support America's foreign policy goals.  A quick look at the facts, however, shows that these arguments are groundless.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One measurement of America's influence around the world is the voting records of U.S.  foreign aid recipients in the United Nations.  If a direct connection exists between foreign aid and winning friends overseas, as the Administration asserts, recipients should be voting with the U.S.  in the U.N.  most of the time.  In fact, they do not.  The data show that most recipients of foreign aid vote against the U.S.  most of the time.  Consider the following fact gathered from the 1995 U.N.  session:
<p><ul>
<li><b>64 percent of U.S.  foreign aid recipients</b> voted against the U.S.  a majority of the time.
<p>
<li><b>India,</b> the fifth-largest recipient with some $157 million in U.S.  foreign aid this year, voted against the U.S.  83 percent of the time.  That is as often as Cuba and more often than Iran.
<p>
<li><b>The ten countries</b> that voted against the U.S.  the most frequently will receive over $212 million in foreign aid in FY 1996 (see <a href="fyi101t1.gif">Table 1</a>).
<p>
<li><b>Seven of the ten largest recipients</b> of U.S.  foreign aid voted against the U.S.  a majority of the time (see <a href="fyi101t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
<p>
<li><b>Of the ten countries</b> that voted with the U.S.  the most often, nine are former Soviet bloc countries (see <a href="fyi101t3.gif">Table 3</a>).
<p>
<li><b>Egypt,</b> the second largest recipient of American foreign aid, voted against the U.S.  67 percent of the time.  This is worse than the 1994 session, when Egypt voted against the U.S.  65 percent of the time.  Egypt will receive some $2.2 billion in U.S.  foreign aid in FY 1996.
<p>
<li><b>Haiti,</b> where President Bill Clinton sent American troops to restore deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, voted against the U.S.  60 percent of the time during the1996 session.  Despite this, the U.S.  will send some $124 million in foreign aid to Haiti in FY 1996.
<p>
<li><b>Mexico,</b> where President Bill Clinton fought for a $40 billion international economic bailout, most of which will come from U.S.  taxpayers, voted against the U.S.  58 percent of the time.  In addition to its $40 billion economic bailout plan, the Clinton Administration has endorsed another $25 million in foreign aid for Mexico.
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There may be many reasons why a country votes with or against the U.S.  at the U.N.  But it is clear from these data that foreign aid does not win friends where it counts:  in supporting U.S.  diplomatic initiatives at the United Nations.  Clearly, the U.S.  foreign aid program in general, and under the Clinton Administration in particular, has done little to justify public confidence that tax dollars are being used wisely by America's foreign aid bureaucracy.  President Clinton has defended two of his biggest foreign policy and economic initiatives -- "restoring" democracy in Haiti and the economic bailout of Mexico -- as in the U.S.  national interest.  Yet these countries seem to care little about Americas interests when it comes to supporting the U.S.  at the U.N.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress should evaluate the extent to which U.S.  recipients of foreign aid support America's national interests.  U.N.  voting records clearly show that a majority of recipients of U.S.  foreign aid vote against the U.S.  most of the time.  In fact, the data show that some of these countries actually undermine U.S.  interests abroad.  For example, South Africa, America's sixth largest recipient of foreign aid is quickly extending relations to some of America's biggest enemies:  Cuba, Iran, and Libya.  This fiscal year, South Africa will receive some $132 million in U.S.  foreign aid.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Why, then, is the U.S.  spending so much money on countries that obviously care little about America's interests abroad?  And why is the Clinton Administration fighting to save this program when most Americans are opposed to it?  This year, when the U.S.  foreign aid budget is scrutinized by Congress as a target for reaching a balanced budget, Congress would do well to cut the program further and seek to abolish the Agency for International Development.

<h3> A Personal Report from the Education Summit: What Does It Mean For Education Reform? </h3>
<b>By  <a href="/heritage/staff/doyle.html">Denis P. Doyle</a><br> 
Senior Fellow in Education </b>
<p>
A Heritage Foundation Symposium, given May 21, 1996.</p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Allow me to share with you my impressions of the recent Education Summit, sponsored jointly by IBM and the nation's governors. As an invited guest representing The Heritage Foundation, I was impressed by the tone and temper of the meeting. There was a clear reaffirmation of the principle that the job of public education is a state and local task; it is not the job of the federal government. And while the governors and the representatives of corporate America have a direct interest in the best education of America's children, including real standards, tests, and results, the ultimate engine of reform is dedicated parents. They are most interested in their children's education. While school choice, the most vigorous and far-reaching education reform measure available to us, was not on the summit agenda, we all know that market-based reform like school choice enforces accountability to parents. It is the natural ally of high academic standards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It was an extraordinary first. Forty-three governors encamped to the IBM Palisades, New York, conference center March 26 and 27, 1996, to talk about -- and act on-- education standards. A gathering of eagles, each governor was accompanied by a home-state CEO of his or her choosing. To round out the invitation list, IBM CEO Louis V. Gerstner and co-host Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson invited 30 education "resource people."  More than the usual suspects, the resource people were a motley crew of special-interest pleaders, state education leaders, foundation executives, think tank intellectuals, and policy analysts. Indeed, the most distinctive resource person was Secretary Riley, invited neither as a participant nor as a speaker. His silence spoke volumes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Governor Thompson and CEO Gerstner jointly presided over the two-day meeting, and were joined at the head table by a bipartisan steering committee made up of Governors Terry Branstad (R-IA), John Engler (R-MI), Jim Hunt (D-NC), incoming NGA head Bob Miller (D-NV), and Roy Romer (D-CO). CEOs Robert E. Allen (AT&T), John L. Clendenin (BellSouth Corporation), George Fisher (Kodak), John Pepper (P&G), and Frank Shrontz (Boeing) shared the spotlight.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the meeting's larger purpose was to reinvigorate the standards movement and highlight education technology, its real function was to solemnize the fact that the federal role in education is virtually at an end. Governor Thompson made one thing crystal clear in his opening remarks: The meeting was addressing a problem that was national in scope but that did not call for a federal government solution. The governors and CEOs could handle it themselves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b> HAIL TO THE CHIEF</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The harmonious picture was completed when President Clinton addressed the group just before lunch on Wednesday, the second day of the conference. Even seasoned Washington watchers were impressed by the security; in addition to the usual complement of Secret Service agents and countless members of the New York highway patrol, each governor was accompanied by a phalanx of plainclothes officers. There were many more people with earpieces and distinctive lapel pins than there were participants.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because the putative purpose of the meeting was to get the education standards train back on track, the first afternoon's plenary session was followed by small group meetings with no press present, chaired jointly by a governor and a CEO; resource people were present but largely seen, not heard. Cocktails and dinner were followed by a six-person panel featuring Al Shanker of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT); Governor Jim Hunt of North Carolina; Chester Finn and Lynn Cheney, conservative appointees and education specialists in the Reagan and Bush Administrations; and Governors John Engler of Michigan and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin. The next morning, small groups of governors, CEOs, and resource people were moved at a forced march through more than a dozen technology exhibits (ten minutes per exhibit). The technology exhibits were carefully scripted and were a great success, not least because of a striking example of enlightened despotism: The majority of the technology displays were running on Apple software. Moreover, the CEO of Apple was at the summit as the guest of the governor of North Dakota.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>PRIVATE INITIATIVE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two things stand out. First, the original idea was Lou Gerstner's. As Chief Executive Officer of IBM, he has had a long-standing interest in education. It was not a government conclave, and it certainly was not a typical business meeting. One of the nation's most vigorous business leaders, Gerstner gained the confidence of Tommy Thompson (concurrently the head of National Governors' Association and Education Commission of the States, the first governor to chair both organizations since Bill Clinton) and Roy Romer, Governor of Colorado and as liberal as Thompson is conservative. While no summit could escape political overtones, this one was neither politically conceived nor politically motivated. It achieved a status often talked about but only infrequently realized: It was bipartisan. (The issue of school choice was not on the table; had it been, the bipartisan aura would have evaporated quickly, as a brief public colloquy between Governors George Allen of Virginia and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin revealed as the summit was wrapping up. Even more was apparently said in private.)
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Limiting the agenda to issues about which bipartisan agreement could be achieved was no small feat. Indeed, two years ago, when the 103rd Congress was still sitting, there could not have been widespread agreement about standards. That such agreement is emerging is a commentary on the temper of the times. And while Gerstner is a political animal within the corporate world, he does not approach education as a political issue. It was his insight to take the issue to the governors. Gerstner is no newcomer to the issue; he has been worried about the quality of the nation's schools for a very long time. I know about his interest first hand as the co-author of a book with him (and two other colleagues) several years ago: <i>Reinventing Education: Entrepreneurship in America's Public Schools </i> (New York, E. P. Dutton). Among other things, it tells the story of the RJR Nabisco Foundation's Next Century Schools program, in which Gerstner oversaw the investment of $32 million in 43 schools across the country -- not an insignificant amount, even by Washington standards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Interestingly, governors, highly political in their own states, are strikingly nonpartisan with each other. They are as courtly with other governors as members of the U.S. Senate are with colleagues; but unlike Senators, their show of bipartisanship is real. In part this is because they do not see other governors as competitors. They have much in common and much to learn from each other, and they know it. They genuinely enjoy each other's company as well, which is one of the reasons they gave former Governor Clinton such a warm welcome; regardless of party affiliation, he's a member of the tribe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton, for his part, gave a speech calculated to please--as it did--and demonstrated that what he is ideally suited to be is "governor" of the United States. The President, as many know, can charm the birds out of the trees. And if he believes what he says--or if he acts as though he does--American education could be in for a big change. This is always a challenge for those of us who tend to be skeptical of the President's diplomatic relations between his language and his actions. In his 1996 State of the Union speech, Clinton had proclaimed that the era of big government was at an end. From his federal budget submissions, however, this is not at all clear to the rest of us. In his Palisades education policy speech, he repeated that promise. Not surprisingly, like much of his State of the Union Address, it was a speech 95 percent of which any Republican could have delivered with complete conviction.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The high points were few and memorable. Clinton opened with the claim that what matters in education is effort. Not talent or IQ or luck; effort. How quaint. And how on the mark. Nothing is more patronizing--or damaging--to poor or minority children than to tell them that nothing they do matters, that whatever might happen to them is the luck of the socioeconomic draw. About this point the President is right. He went on to say that standards are essential, just as state-developed assessments are. The pivotal point, however, was his use of the word "consequences."  Only one other public figure regularly uses that word, AFT President Al Shanker, and it is no accident that he has been heavily lobbying the President and his senior staff about this issue for months. Clinton gave "consequences" operational significance when he attached a liberal sacred cow: social promotion. No more, he intoned. Right again.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
C-SPAN carried the full proceedings of the summit. President Clinton mentioned that he had watched the panel discussion from the comfort of the White House. His folksy references to panelists' comments--particularly Al Shanker's--offered another striking example of his command of the subject of his speech.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clinton closed with a paean about discipline: No one can teach or learn in an undisciplined and unsafe environment. As Checker Finn noted, it was a speech which Ronald Reagan could have given. There was not a single reference to the federal government, no talk about federal standards, and nary a word about Goals 2000.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And what was true of Clinton's comments was true of the governors and CEOs. The idea that standards are a state and local issue was supported unanimously, or at least with no public dissent. In the case of governors like Jim Hunt and Roy Romer, their willingness to go along may be simple political prudence. They know that the federal role will soon be <i>de minimis</i>, and they are reconciled to this new reality. They might wish that it were otherwise but made no public complaint or statement to that effect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>NEW, NEW FEDERALISM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For my part, I am convinced that whatever their private reservations or reluctance might be now, they will grow to like their new role. Governors actually enjoy governing, and education is typically the biggest single item in their budgets. While they know that freedom from Washington will have a price (federal spending reductions), they are likely to find that life is both simpler and more interesting without Uncle Sam looking over their shoulders.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Presidents from Nixon to Clinton, of course, have flirted with the idea of "new federalism."  Indeed, it is a Nixon coinage, but has made little substantive headway over the years. It is one of those ideas that is good in principle but very difficult to put into practice. Part of the problem is the sheer weight of habit, part is fear of the unknown, part is the heavy lifting required to change the contours of massive programs. Changing what Washington does is hard work, just as changing what the states do is.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The creation of the U.S. Department of Education in 1978 by Jimmy Carter is a case in point; it was a major Democratic campaign promise to the NEA, but Carter could barely marshal the votes to get the bill out of the House of Representatives. It was a "ho-hum" issue in Congress, eliciting only weak support and unenthusiastic opposition. Undoing the department falls in the same category, as President Reagan discovered to his chagrin: He couldn't find an author to carry his promised legislation to abolish the department in his first term in office.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In any case, the real strength of "new federalism" will depend precisely on the extent to which its practitioners prefer it to the old federalism. And the assembled governors gave every indication that they will actually welcome it. Time will tell.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A second noteworthy point is that the summit was not dominated by the otherwise ubiquitous special interests. True, many of the resource people were members of the special-interest crowd; the AFT's Al Shanker and NEA President Keith Geiger were both there, but they were among a silent throng at the back of the hall.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In an era overwhelmingly dominated by politics--indeed, in an era in which "politics" has become a dirty word -- it is hard to overestimate the importance of the simple fact that the summit was the product of private, not public, interest. That may account for the relative isolation of the special-interest groups at the summit itself. Ironically, there was concern in some conservative circles that the summit was no more than a new generation of "robber barons" working their will on a malleable and hapless populace. Perhaps, but a more realistic analysis is to take Gerstner of IBM and his fellow CEOs at face value. They are genuinely worried about the future of America and are convinced that, left to their own devices, schools will not spontaneously reform. If not CEO pressure, then whose?  If not now, when?  To suspect them of sinister motives is a bit much, particularly when their professed motives are manifestly reasonable. Parents, whose children have the most to lose in a failing educational system, need their help and should enlist them as allies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The fact is that CEOs are interested parties, not parties-at-interest, and they come as close to being disinterested as any reformers can. They are the ultimate consumers of the schools' product and have a real stake in school performance. Equally important, they don't want problems; they want solutions and have no desire to tell anyone how to do it or what to do. They just want results. The CEO point of view is captured in David Kearns's comment when he was head of Xerox before joining the U.S. Department of Education as former Secretary Lamar Alexander's Deputy Secretary: "If the schools educate, business will train."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MANY A SLIP BETWIXT CUP AND LIP</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What is the ostensible and what is the likely outcome of the summit?  In this case, they are likely to be the same. There is actually reason to believe that something will happen as a result of the summit. No one in America is more results-oriented than CEOs; they are serious, and about this they mean business. The governors too; they are now in it so deep that it would be hard to pull back. Indeed, the issue is not withdrawing, but just what it is they will do and when they will do it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The communiqu produced by the summit was reasonably clear about the next step: the creation by the governors of a national--not federal--clearinghouse (or "war room," as Governor Thompson called it) that would be going full-bore within two years. Designed to serve the states, it would keep everyone up to date on standards, but its more important function would be to set the stage for meaningful comparisons among states. Then we -- and the governors--would know who is "world-class" and who is not. Discussions about the clearinghouse have already begun; to be sure, there are numerous practical decisions to be made, not least who will pay for it and will "it" be a new or existing organization?  While logic would suggest that an existing organization should assume that role, candidates are not so obvious as they might at first appear.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The most logical is the Education Commission of the States (ECS), created three decades ago by then North Carolina Governor Terry Sanford and James Bryant Conant, former Harvard president and author of <i>The American High School Today</i>. ECS's mission was to keep Washington at bay, a task at which, to no one's surprise, it failed utterly. A sort of <i>estates general</i>, its membership included governors, chief state school officers, state legislators, and sundry interested citizens. ECS quickly became a part of the establishment and today is a flaccid institution. If ECS was too broadly conceived to maintain any focus, the National Governors' Association (NGA) suffers from the opposite problem.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In any case, the summiteers seemed to have no interest in passing the standards baton to either ECS or NGA. In the closing comments at least, the governors asserted their interest in a wholly new organization, one that would exist for the sole purpose of promulgating standards and comparisons. Time will tell.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the communiqu did not call for a state "wall chart," it is hard to imagine state comparisons without one, and we may soon witness states actually participating in comparisons, the one with the other.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>THE DOG THAT DIDN'T BARK</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What was missing at the summit?  Ironically, two points of view were virtually absent. One is the national (not federal) perspective that Diane Ravitch, a sensible conservative reformer, ably represents. In her post-summit wrap-up, she laments the absence of this view. Who needs fifty sets of standards?  Diane asks. Who indeed?  For better or worse, it is my strongly held view that we do need state, even local, standards and that the issue of "fifty standards" is moot. We will not have Nevada math and Maryland math, Oregon English and Florida English; Americans in each state and locality will quite naturally gravitate to similar standards, and insofar as differences may emerge, they will probably emerge for good reason.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The real danger of national (not federal) or state (not local) standards is that they will be forced to a lowest common denominator by political pressures. True, the absence of national or state standards would permit lackadaisical school districts to continue in their feckless manner, but the presence of high standards in neighboring districts will have a salutary effect. It may put some starch in slackers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Be that as it may, the most important point of view not represented at the summit (except in a brief reference by Lynn Cheney) was old-fashioned localism or, as it is characterized in education circles, local control. That governors and CEOs would not be naturally drawn to this point of view is no surprise; modern CEOs are as likely to think in global as local terms, and governors by virtue of their jobs, think in statewide terms. This is not to say that either is opposed to local control, just that the terms of the discussion were cast as state-level concerns.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To be sure, there is a powerful statewide dimension; in all the states, education is a state constitutional responsibility, and education typically consumes more than half the state budget. Only in a few outliers like New Hampshire is the state role tiny; less than ten percent of New Hampshire's education spending comes from state sources. At the other end of the scale is Hawaii, the nation's only statewide school system (though, thanks to the interaction effects between Proposition 13 and the <i>Serrano</i> school finance case, California is virtually a statewide system). Even in these situations, however, education is quintessentially a school-based (even schoolroom-based) enterprise, and the role of the state in standard setting should be approached with the utmost circumspection. The obvious danger is standardization, a fate to be avoided at all costs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
School districts and school buildings must be on the front lines of standard setting for several reasons, not least because they must live with them. Governors, chief state school officers, and state legislators have an understandable interest in setting standards, but they should resist the temptation to impose them on school districts. Standards cannot be parachuted in; schools must "own" them if they are to have any lasting effect. Equally important, the process of setting standards at the local level is a powerful trainer and community builder. If teachers and parents are involved in setting standards from the beginning, they both learn about them and support them. Knowing what they are and how they are to be put in place lends reality to the idea that standards will have consequences.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The most powerful and useful role for the state will be in developing standards "advisories": model standards, templates even, for local school districts to use as they engage in the standard setting process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The logic of local standard setting is not "let a thousand flowers bloom," though there will be some of that. The logic is ownership, because as each community works through the standard setting process, each community's standards will be substantially like each other's. So too, each state's set of "advisories" will be like every other's. There are two reasons for this. First, there exists among Americans a high degree of social consensus about what young people should know and be able to do. For example, most Americans would agree that to earn a diploma, all students should be able to read and understand a news story in a national news magazine, a national newspaper, and their local paper. They should be able to count and compute; understand plane geometry and algebra; read, write, and speak standard American English; and so on.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There will be differences, to be sure. The citizens of Los Alamos, New Mexico, for example, may want their graduates to know solid geometry and trigonometry, not just algebra. The citizens of Seattle, Washington, may want their graduates to master marine biology and vulcanology, while their counterparts in Arizona may be more interested in desert ecosystems. Citizens in Texas will want graduates to know Texas history and geography to a level of detail that other communities will not. And so on. So much the better. This is not a difference to be ignored or suppressed, but one that should be applauded.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, even insofar as there are regional differences in subjects like history and literature, the foundations are much the same. A high standard requiring mastery of historical material and methodology can be satisfied using very different content. The study of literature is made richer and more rewarding by attending to local writers. So too with science standards. It would be altogether sensible for each area of the country to emphasize its strengths; Arizonans might master the scientific method and meet high science standards by emphasizing Canyon geology and water erosion, just as residents around the Great Lakes might emphasize the impact of glaciation. Finally, there is no California algebra or Illinois chemistry.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>TEACHING TO THE TEST</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the assessment and consequences parts of the standards agenda are attended to with enthusiasm, the issue of who sets the standards is less important than who asks the test questions. Ultimately, that is what standards are all about. If the tests and measures are carefully crafted and calibrated, they will do a world of good, for the assessments actually set the standard. Indeed, that is what the old bromide about "teaching to the test" is all about: If it is a bad test, so much the worse; if it is a good test, so much the better. One way to think about it is this: The test is the interrogatory form of the standard; the statement of the standard is the declarative form. What this means in practice is that the test must be a solid instrument, because many people--employers, school board members, taxpayers, students, teachers--will come to rely on it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The questions must seek and measure "world-class" knowledge and skills, and they must do so in a world-class way. Which is to say, the tests must de-emphasize the true-and-false, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blanks format. The only reason for such a format is low-cost, high-speed scoring -- administrative convenience. It is noteworthy that adults are not tested this way in the real world. The tests we must meet are performance-based: Do we measure up?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Schools--and the institutions that test them and their students--will need to reintroduce the written and spoken word: essays, declamations, auditions, performances. Again, that is how we are measured after school. School measures should be no different.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>BENCHMARKING</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The issue of assessment raises the most important aspect of standards--seeing that they are met, holding people accountable. To do this sensibly requires tests and measures that are reliable. Put simply, standards and the tests used to measure them must permit comparisons, both among schools in a district and among districts in a state as well as among schools in different states and between states. Governors must be able to boast (or complain) about their states' academic standings as readily as they do state university football scores. Without the capacity to compare each other with some precision, the whole standard setting exercise will be worse than moot; it will be an exercise in futility.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Interestingly, the German Republic provides an example of this in action. A federal system, the German states, or <i>Lnder</i>, are entirely free of federal control, and federal funding as well. Like their American counterparts, who have a Council of Chief State School Officers housed in Washington, D.C., the Germans have a similar council housed in Bonn (soon to move to Berlin). But there the similarity ends. The German council meets and confers to keep the national government at arm's length; they will not tolerate national intrusion in <i>Land</i> affairs. At the same time, the German council members use their forum to compare themselves to each other, which they do with gusto. America's governors can--and should-- take a page from the German book. At the turn of the old century, we borrowed <i>kindergarten</i> from the Germans; as the new century approaches, it is time for another learned borrowing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What remains is for the governors to push hard on the assessment front. Their task, difficult but within reach, is to see that state assessments permit both intrastate and interstate comparisons. Without the capacity to do so, standard setting will be for naught. Ironically, the place for them to turn is the federal government and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Overseen by the National Assessment Governing Board, the operation has gained the respect of most observers of the passing scene. It has been genuinely bipartisan, and its members have acted responsibly and prudently. The NAEP is almost all we have to go on as a nation, and it would be wise both to strengthen it--for national-level data and analysis--and to permit states and school districts to tap into the data stream so they can learn more about themselves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indeed, that is the crux of the matter: When schools and school districts want to learn more about themselves, when they actively want to know how they compare where they are strong as well as weak, then the momentum for change will grow. Whether or not the summit will ignite that spark remains to be seen.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR GRASSROOTS REFORMERS?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the final analysis, the summit was wonderful theater, but the heavy lifting of school reform remains to be done. Who will do it and where will the work be carried out?  It will be accomplished school-by-school, district-by-district, by involved citizens. They will make it happen. To be involved, they must know what is going on and what needs to be done. First, citizens across the country should welcome CEO and gubernatorial interest; it is genuine and may even be useful. Certainly, governors like Thompson, Romer, and Engler, who were central to the summit planning process, are serious about reform. So too were the CEOs. And while their perspectives will differ to some degree, all will respond to citizen interest and activity.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are three things that should happen at the grass roots, then. Citizens everywhere should take the pledge to support:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
High academic standards;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Realistic tests and measures to see that students are meeting those standards; and
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consequences.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What does this mean in practice?  Standards must be set and met locally. The state is not much better than Uncle Sam when it comes to local control. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty as regards both the state and federal governments. To be sure, states can play a more constructive role than Washington, but they should not engage in a command-and-control relationship with local school districts. It is not only bad politics; it is worse pedagogy. The freer schools are to do their own thing, the better off they are. Standards templates, or advisories, can be designed at the state level and made available to local districts but should not be imposed on them. If the standards are realistic and useful, local districts will flock to them. If they are not, they will not. And properly so. So too with tests and measures. To see that the standards are met, school districts must adopt tests that fit their standards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In this connection, there are two interlocking issues. Local districts should adopt tests that are consistent with the standards they have adopted. Not every district will want to (or be able to) design and adopt tests unique to it. In this case, the state can offer technical assistance and advice but should not impose its will on local districts. Again, to do so would be bad politics and worse pedagogy. The state does, however, have a reasonable and proper interest in knowing how much its students know, and should support statewide testing to provide both state and district information. Such tests should be developed cooperatively with local schools, but should permit the governor to brag about the state's overall performance. Without such information, the cause of school reform will falter and eventually founder. And the information--once it is available -- will be invaluable to local schools. If anything, they need it more than the state does. No business could do without high-quality performance data, and schools are no exception to this general rule.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is one final note that everyone must attend to, and that is the one issue that was not on the table at the summit: <i>education choice</i>. Its absence was duly noted by several governors in attendance, but the ground rules made it impossible to bring it up. No such ground rule works at the local level. Bring choice up, not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it is crucial to the standards debate. Indeed, without choice the standards debate is almost sure to become an empty exercise. There is simply no reason to believe that every school in every district in every state will hold itself to the same high standards; it can't be done politically, and it can't be done logistically, at least not in the next two decades. Only highly centralized school systems like those of France and Japan even attempt such an approach, and it is not clear that it works in those countries. And the American commitment to local control rules out any centralized solution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>THE BLESSINGS OF THE MARKET</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The alternative to command and control is a market, whether it is purely private, as many of us would like it to be, or regulated, a mix of public and private providers. Markets have two overwhelmingly important characteristics. First, they are exquisitely calibrated communications systems, letting willing buyers and sellers know what good or service is available at what price in what quantity and quality, and letting each know what the other would like; second, as Schumpeter declared, they permit "creative destruction."  Inefficient, corrupt, and ineffectual organizations disappear. That's what markets are all about. That is why in a market the consumer is sovereign. That is why cost doesn't determine price.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To create a system of high academic standards, and schools which are safe and disciplined, there must be choice among schools. Schools themselves must be able to choose to have high standards and to deliver on them. Just so, parents and students must be able to select schools that measure up and select out of those that do not.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Attempting to push standards down from the top will not work any better than the endless skein of failed reforms that already litter the education landscape. But double-joining standards and choice can work. Indeed, it is the last, best hope of school reform.

<title> Speaking for Hong Kong-- Heritage</title>

<b>Heritage Lecture No. 563</b>
<p>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.html">Lectures and

<hr>
<p>
<b>By The Rt. Hon. Christopher Patten</b></p> 
<p>
Given May 7, 1996<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong is very fortunate to have so many friends and well-wishers in the United States. Over the next 14 months and beyond, Hong Kong is going to need its friends in the United States and elsewhere. Hong Kong needs the understanding and the support of the United States as it progresses through the most testing period of its history, the final months before July 1, 1997, and the transfer of sovereignty to the People's Republic of China. I have come to Washington this week to talk to our friends about an issue which is crucial to Hong Kong's ongoing economic and social success. As you all know, I have come to Washington to put Hong Kong's case--let me repeat that--Hong Kong's case for the renewal of China's most-favored-nation trading status.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I want to make this point absolutely clear right at the start. I have not traveled to Washington to speak on behalf of the People's Republic of China. It is not for me to put China's case for the renewal of MFN status. Nor is it for me to defend China's record on human rights, on arms proliferation, or its trade practices. These are matters which Chinese officials must address, not the Governor of Hong Kong.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am not saying that Hong Kong has no view on these issues. On the contrary, Hong Kong has very strong opinions about human rights and about free and fair trade. Our record as a pluralist society based on the rule of law and our record as probably the most open economy in the world tells you all you need to know about where we stand on these issues. My task today and during the rest of my visit to the United States is to speak for Hong Kong, to put, as I have said, Hong Kong's case for MFN renewal, and I shall do so with all the force that I can command.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I shall be putting two arguments to everyone I meet. The first is an argument for the preservation of a fundamental trade principle. The second is an argument for the preservation of jobs and livelihoods in Hong Kong. Let me start with principles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Round about the turn of the last century, the Patten family, my forbears, decided it had a principled position on the pressing issue of poverty. They did not like it, so they left Ireland and set off for Manchester. Now Manchester, during the last century, was the epicenter of a free trade earthquake which shook protectionism everywhere. Manchester was so committed, some might say obsessed, with free trade as a political issue that it named its principal place of public assembly the Free Trade Hall. This is the only example that I know where a city named one of its public buildings for a proposition from economic theory. That is, of course, unless I missed the opening of the Milton Friedman "Tight Money" concert hall in Chicago recently.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Manchester won the free trade argument, and, as a result, the first great free trade revolution occurred after 1846 under British leadership. During the following 30 years, international trade increased by more than 300 percent. History repeated itself and the second great revolution in free trade occurred exactly a century later. This revolution took place under American leadership and started in 1946. Again, the value of international trade increased by more than 300 percent in the following 30 years. It was the United States which made this 20th century expansion of trade and prosperity possible. The United States provided the world with unstinting aid directly and through almost every multilateral organization. The United States also provided resources and incentives to emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere and kept its huge market open to the export products of these economies. At the same time, American business invested enormous amounts of capital in the reconstruction of Europe and Japan and in developing economics everywhere, but particularly in Asia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economic, social, and political consequences of this American free trade leadership have been profound. You need look no further than Hong Kong to understand what it has meant.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong has enjoyed 35 years of unbroken economic growth. During this time, our per capita GDP has increased by 530 percent so that we are now on a par with Canada and much of Western Europe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong has put its growing prosperity to good use. We provide tertiary education places for 24 percent of each generation of students--up from about 3 percent 10 years ago. Our health care standards are now fast approaching the standards of Western Europe and North America--and some of our health indicators are actually better. We have invested in our people and invested heavily in our infrastructure.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, hard work and a high savings ratio have been important. But it was free trade-- access to the United States market in the post-war years--which gave Hong Kong, and many of our neighbors in Asia, their big break. Without the liberal trading environment created under the GATT and now continuing under the World Trade Organization, there would have been no German, Japanese or, more recently, Southeast Asian economic miracles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What has been true of the past 50 years will, I think, be true of the next 50 years. American leadership will be as vital in maintaining the momentum of free trade during the first half of the 21st century as it has been during the second half of the 20th century. And a crucial test of this leadership is the one which most concerns Hong Kong. The issue can be simply stated: Can the United States and China establish and maintain a normal trading relationship?  I say normal trading relationship because, of course, MFN status is the international norm. The alternative is an abnormal trading relationship between the United States and China, and that, it seems, would be in no one's interests, certainly not Hong Kong's.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me make Hong Kong's position absolutely clear. We are not suggesting that the United States, or any other country which shares your and our values, should soft-pedal on the other major issues in the relationship with China. Human rights are at least as important as trade relations. Nor can there be any higher priority for all of us than controlling the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nor can there be any doubt that trade practices must be fair or that intellectual property rights must be protected.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But I believe that MFN should be used as a key to achieve progress on all of these issues, not as a weapon. MFN status should be allowed its opportunity to facilitate progress on all of these issues. By contrast, I believe, withdrawal of MFN status would hinder, rather than promote, such progress. The policy of engagement adopted by the United States seems to me, and seems to the community for which I speak, to be the only policy which offers the possibility of making progress on the full range of issues in the U.S.-China relationship.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I said earlier that I wanted to preserve a principle and that I wanted to preserve Hong Kong jobs. This second argument for renewing China's MFN status is, to put it bluntly, a matter of special pleading. Hong Kong is now so closely integrated with the Chinese economy that anything which damages the relationship between the United States and China, our two largest trading partners, is certain to injure us. Specifically, if MFN is not renewed, Hong Kong stands to lose about 90,000 jobs and up to half of our forecast annual growth in GDP. I recognize that Hong Kong's economy is flexible and that we would recover from such a blow in time. But the blow would fall at a particularly difficult time for Hong Kong. It would come just as we are about to start the final year of the transition to Chinese sovereignty, at a time when Hong Kong is particularly vulnerable to shocks to confidence in its future and we can least afford a setback to our economic fortunes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There might be people here today who wish Hong Kong well on MFN, people who are concerned to give Hong Kong the best possible chance of making a success of its future as a Special Administrative Region of China, people who think that putting conditions on the renewal of China's MFN would in some way help Hong Kong to achieve this. I want to say to you in the clearest possible terms: Thanks, but no thanks. I am not aware of any community leader in Hong Kong who advocates anything other than renewal of China's MFN without conditions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The message I bring from Hong Kong on MFN is this: If you want to help Hong Kong, please listen to what we are saying on this crucial issue and saying unanimously. To any of our friends and supporters in Washington or elsewhere who are tempted by the idea of MFN conditions, I say to you on behalf of the whole community in Hong Kong that you will not help us by damaging our economy and damaging confidence in our future. The best way to help us is by renewing MFN and by continuing the policy of engagement towards China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I have not pointed and will not be pointing to the economic consequences for the United States of any deterioration in the trade relationship with China as a result of not renewing MFN or of attaching conditions. This is a matter for Americans, not for the Governor of Hong Kong. I will make only one tangential observation and leave it at that. I am no economist, and I do not claim to be an expert on the theory of comparative advantage and free trade. But I hope that I have got the basics right, perhaps because my family absorbed some of Manchester's free trade zeal, or perhaps just because I read Adam Smith. And the basics are that free trade is beneficial to those who practice it regardless of what others do. If I may paraphrase a 19th century French economist, to argue that the United States should be protectionist because other countries do not practice free trade is like saying that you should block up your harbors because other countries have rocky coasts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thomas Jefferson once said that no country was ever ruined by trade. He was right, but quite a few countries have been damaged by protectionism. The essential point I want to leave you with today, ladies and gentlemen, is that Hong Kong has lived and prospered by free trade. Please do not do anything to jeopardize Hong Kong's trade, Hong Kong's prosperity, or Hong Kong's future.

<p>
<b>THE DECADES-LONG EFFORT TO BAN CHEMICAL WEAPONS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The history behind the Chemical Weapons Convention is a long and tortuous one. It has long been the aim of diplomats to curtail both the use and stockpiling of chemical weapons. Among the earliest attempts in modern times to ban the use of chemical weapons was the 1907 Hague Convention. Approved by the European powers, the convention prohibited the use of weapons containing poison, but the widespread use of chemical weapons in World War I proved that this prohibition had little effect. After the war, a League of Nations conference convened in Switzerland to approve the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which prohibited the use of both biological and chemical weapons in war, but not their development, production, and stockpiling. Among the countries signing the Geneva Protocol were the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, and Japan. Unlike the 1907 Hague Convention, the Geneva Protocol was successful once war broke out. Chemical weapons were not used widely during World War II, but this success was due to implicit threats by allied leaders, particularly President Franklin Roosevelt, to respond in kind to any chemical attack. It is one of history's clearest examples of a successful deterrence policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Geneva Protocol is still in force, and the U.S. honors its terms, although it did not ratify the protocol until 1975. It is, however, a weak agreement. If countries violate it, they remain unpunished, and there are no established procedures for determining the veracity of reported claims of biological or chemical weapons use. It is sometimes referred to as the "no first use" agreement because participating states agreed to comply with its terms so long as biological or chemical weapons were not used against them first. Some states, including the U.S., ratified the agreement with the reservation that it would cease to be binding if they were attacked first.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Violations of the Geneva Protocol have occurred on several occasions since the end of World War II. The Soviet Union and its clients, for example, used mycotoxins, commonly referred to as "yellow rain," against civilians in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia in the 1970s and 1980s, and Iraq used chemical weapons during its eight-year war with Iran in the 1980s.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Negotiations leading to the Chemical Weapons Convention began in 1971 when the U.N. Conference on Disarmament's predecessor organization, the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee, voted to conduct separate talks on banning biological and chemical weapons. This allowed for the conclusion in 1992 of the Biological Weapons Convention, which banned the production and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons, but put negotiations to ban chemical weapons on the back burner for well over a decade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By the mid-1980s, the Reagan Administration, expressing concern over the large-scale Soviet chemical weapons program, began producing a new generation of chemical munitions for the U.S. military. The subsequent U.S. program was legal because the 1925 Geneva Protocol outlawed only the use, not the development, production, and stockpiling, of chemical munitions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Diplomatic efforts in the 1980s focused on stopping the spread of chemical weapons to Third World countries. In 1984, Australia proposed to establish controls on the export of ingredients that could be used to manufacture chemical weapons. This proposal was made to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an organization of the industrialized states to coordinate economic development policies for the Third World. The Australians wanted participating countries to coordinate export control policies to stem the transfer of chemical weapons-related technologies to the Third World. Specific restrictions and enforcement mechanisms were left to individual governments. The "Australia Group" now has 29 members, including such prominent nations as the U.S., France, Britain, and Japan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The informal and voluntary nature of the Australian proposal has limited its effectiveness. For example, the enforcement of the export restrictions falls to individual member governments, but industrialized nations have a spotty record on how vigorously they enforce export restrictions. In the 1980s, a Phillips Petroleum Company subsidiary in Belgium delivered the chemical thiodiglycol (used in manufacturing mustard gas) to Iraq, and Britain is reported to have sold thiodiglycol and thionyl chloride to Iraq in 1988 and 1989. Both transfers were contrary to the commitments made by Belgium and Britain in the Australia Group. Export control policies, while useful to pursue, by themselves cannot stop the spread of chemical weapons.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President George Bush came to office determined to ban chemical weapons. President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev signed an agreement on June 1, 1990, in Washington to reduce the chemical stockpiles of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to 5,000 metric tons each. No accord, however, was reached outlining inspection procedures for confirming the destruction of these weapons. That was left to subsequent negotiations, which were supposed to be completed by December 31, 1990. This deadline passed without agreement between Moscow and Washington, and the "bilateral destruction agreement" has yet to be brought into force. This failure, to some extent, was due to the turmoil in the Soviet Union, which was collapsing politically. Further, both sides were aware that progress was being made on the Chemical Weapons Convention at the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, and that this convention would have extensive inspection procedures and would ban the weapons entirely. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the setbacks at the bilateral level with Russia, President Bush announced on May 13, 1991, that the U.S. would agree to a complete ban of chemical weapons even if some other nations did not eliminate their arsenals. Bush also pledged that the U.S. would forswear the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances, including situations in which U.S. forces are attacked with such weapons first.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Until that time, Washington had reserved the right to use chemical weapons if attacked with them first and to maintain a chemical weapons stockpile for the purpose of deterrence and possible retaliation. This unilateral concession by the U.S., along with another to drop the demand for stringent "any time, anywhere" inspections of possible chemical weapons facilities, put the Chemical Weapons Convention negotiations on the fast track. The final draft of the convention was completed on September 3, 1991, in Geneva. It was signed in Paris by more than the 65 countries required for ratification to bring the convention into force, including by the United States. Now the Senate, in fulfilling its role to advise and consent to all treaties, must decide whether the United States will ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention.  
<p>
<b>PROVISIONS OF THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I think it would be useful to review the content of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The purpose of the convention is to ban chemical weapons and forbid their production, stockpiling, and use by participating states. It would do so by establishing elaborate procedures for eliminating all chemical weapons no later than ten years after the convention enters into force and by requiring the elimination of chemical weapons production facilities within the same ten-year period. The convention, however, does not require the destruction of toxic chemicals, their precursors (chemicals that can be combined to form toxic chemicals), or facilities that are used for peaceful purposes. Likewise, small stockpiles of lethal chemicals may be retained for the development of defenses against chemical weapons. These chemicals, precursors, and production facilities are subject to verification measures to detect any attempt to convert them into weapons. The convention is of unlimited duration, which is designed to make the destruction of chemical weapons permanent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Overseeing the implementation of the agreement will be a large international bureaucracy that in many ways resembles the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a U.N. agency that fosters cooperation among nations in the peaceful uses of nuclear power. In a similar vein, a new chemical weapons bureaucracy will be created, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Headquartered at The Hague, this organization will have three parts. The first will be the Conference of State Parties, consisting of the representatives of all states participating in the convention. It will establish general policies for implementing the convention and will oversee the functions of the organization. The second will be the Executive Council, the executive arm of the organization, consisting of the representatives of 41 participating states picked to achieve geographic balance. The third will be the Technical Secretariat, led by a Director General, which will be responsible for carrying out the inspections to verify compliance. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first meeting of a commission preparing the groundwork for the chemical weapons organization took place on February 8, 1993, at The Hague. Since that meeting, the Preparatory Commission has focused on building the Provisional Technical Secretariat, the forerunner of the monitoring agency that will be created after the convention comes into force. Activities of the Preparatory Commission thus far have included finding a building to house the agency, establishing inspection procedures, drafting inspection manuals, procuring and testing inspection equipment, and hiring and training inspectors. According to the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the 1995 budget for the Preparatory Commission was roughly $17 million, of which the U.S. paid 25 percent. Once up and running, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will operate at a cost of about $200 million annually. On the basis of a 25 percent contribution, U.S. taxpayers could be expected to pay $50 million annually to support this international organization.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The verification responsibilities of the Technical Secretariat are vast. The convention's Annex on Implementation and Verification (Verification Annex), over 100 pages long, establishes a long list of inspections to verify that chemical weapons and chemical weapons production facilities are destroyed. The Technical Secretariat also is tasked with ensuring that commercial chemical production facilities are not used to develop and produce weapons. The Verification Annex outlines a number of inspection procedures, including the timing of inspections, the appointment of inspectors, the privileges and immunities that governments must extend to inspectors, and the equipment inspectors may bring with them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Verification Annex establishes eight different kinds of inspection regimes, all of which must be carried out by the Technical Secretariat. The first kind of inspection verifies whether chemical weapons are destroyed. The second is to verify the destruction or conversion of chemical weapons production facilities. The third, fourth, and fifth kinds of inspections are to detect whether certain types of chemicals have been used in building chemical weapons, based on how easily each of three categories (schedules) of chemicals can be turned into weapons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The sixth kind of inspection pertains to production facilities that produce chemicals not found in any of the first three schedules. The seventh is the most sensitive insofar as it involves short-notice inspections of states suspected of violating the terms of the convention. The final kind of inspection requires investigating sites where chemical weapons may have been used.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At first, the U.S. demanded that so-called challenge inspections be allowed anywhere and at any time a violation was suspected. It ultimately abandoned this approach in favor of a British proposal for so-called managed access to suspect sites. Under this provision, the inspected state may take steps to guard its national security, as long as they do not involve evading the convention's terms. In order to protect its security, an inspected state may remove sensitive papers; shroud displays and equipment; log off computers; restrict the types of analyses that may be carried out on air, soil, and effluent samples; and even limit which inspectors may gain access to particular areas at a suspect site.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The inspection process is long and involved. It starts with OPCW officials inspecting the locations declared by a member state as weapons sites. The declaration must be filed with the Technical Secretariat no later than 30 days after the convention enters into force. Work on destroying the chemical weapons at the sites must begin within two years and must be completed within ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Once on a weapons site, inspectors will place seals and monitoring devices to guard against a violation. Similar procedures, such as for placing cameras, exist for monitoring whether chemical weapons, production facilities, and non-weapons chemical production facilities have been destroyed. As many as 1,000 inspections a year may be required.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Operating this complex arrangement of inspection regimes will prove costly to U.S. industry and the government. According to expert David Evans of Analytic Services, Inc., of Arlington, Virginia, U.S. industry can be expected to incur costs of between $20 million and $200 million annually to support the inspection process. The higher costs are more likely in the early stages of implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. But this general cost to industry assumes that everything goes as planned. If the mechanism in the convention to protect proprietary and other sensitive business information fails, Mr. Evans estimates that the cost to business could exceed $1 billion annually. The U.S. government will have its responsibilities for implementing the convention as the national authority serving as an intermediary between industry and the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The cost of these activities to the U.S. government is estimated to be $25 million annually. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention also contains a provision on compliance. The Executive Council bears the responsibility for demanding that a participating state redress a violation. If corrective action is not taken, the Conference of State Parties may suspend the offending state's privileges under the convention. This could include terminating cooperative programs to assist states in developing chemicals for peaceful purposes or denying the offender the right to vote in the Conference of State Parties. In more serious cases of violation, stricter countermeasures would be taken. For example, trade in all chemicals with the offending state could be shut off. In cases where violations pose a threat to the security of other states, the Conference of State Parties may refer the matter to the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Security Council. Ultimately, the Security Council serves as the court of final appeal in the enforcement process.

A FIVE-PART TEST OF ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS AND THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To deserve the support of the Senate, any arms control agreement should pass a five-part test. This test should serve to determine whether a particular arms control agreement meets the minimum standards necessary to serve the national interest. The test consists of five questions, all of which must be answered affirmatively when applied to a particular agreement to insure that it does not contain a fatal flaw. These five questions are: 1) Does the agreement reduce the risk of war?  2) Are the agreement's requirements consistent with U.S. global security responsibilities?  3) Is the agreement adequately verifiable?  4) Is the agreement enforceable?  and 5) Does the agreement enhance national security?  The Chemical Weapons Convention fails to pass this test in all five particulars.
<P>
<b>QUESTION #1: Will the Chemical Weapons Convention reduce the risk of war?
<p>
ANSWER #1: By undermining the U.S. chemical deterrent, the Chemical Weapons Convention may increase the likelihood of war or result in the escalation of an existing conflict.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Reducing the level of armaments is not the most important goal of arms control. Reducing the risk of war is far more important. Arms control agreements should not be destabilizing. It is counterproductive to achieve an arms control agreement that, by reducing arms, only invites attack.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yet this is precisely what the Chemical Weapons Convention will do. The Chemical Weapons Convention is the product of a policy that equates reduced levels of armaments, in this case reduced to zero, with greater security. But the experience of World War II shows that having chemical weapons can deter a chemical attack. If the U.S. bans all of its chemical weapons, outlaw states that retain them will have a military advantage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Almost as important as reducing the risk of war is the goal of preventing the escalation of an existing conflict to a higher level of violence. The Chemical Weapons Convention, although unintentionally, will encourage escalation in two ways. First, chemically armed enemies, knowing that the U.S. and its allies do not possess chemical weapons, will have little incentive to refrain from using such weapons. They will enjoy a unilateral advantage over the U.S., and in time of war they are likely to use it. Second, the convention may increase the likelihood that nuclear weapons will be used. Lacking chemical weapons, the U.S. will be forced to rely on nuclear weapons to deter a chemical attack on U.S. forces. While it is prudent to reserve the right to use nuclear weapons, it is certainly unwise to take steps that lower the threshold for the employment of nuclear weapons.
<P>
<b>QUESTION #2: Are the Chemical Weapons Convention's requirements consistent with America's global responsibilities?
<p>
ANSWER #2: The Chemical Weapons Convention, by treating all nations alike, fails to acknowledge America's special role in global security.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
With the Cold War over, the U.S. is the world's sole superpower. Superpower status imposes important global responsibilities which the U.S. can fulfill only by maintaining armed forces capable of projecting overwhelming force around the globe. Because America has these special responsibilities, it is treated as an exceptional case under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The same principle should apply to America's chemical weapons arsenal. In Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and elsewhere, the U.S. has proved on numerous occasions that it exercises its unmatched power in a manner that is both responsible and respectful of the legitimate interests of other states. But America's global responsibilities also mean that its forces are the most likely to be engaged in major conflicts. The more dangers America faces, the greater the likelihood that chemical weapons will be used against U.S. forces.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention ignores the special responsibilities of the U.S., treating all countries in the same manner. It assumes that U.S. troops face the same likelihood of chemical attack as the tiny constabulary force fielded by Costa Rica, which has the same rights and obligations under the treaty. In this way it contrasts sharply with one of the more successful arms control agreements of the post-World War II era, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, under which the U.S. and four other nations (Britain, China, France, and Russia) are treated in a manner fundamentally different from all other nations. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty accounts for the special responsibilities and broad political roles played by these five acknowledged nuclear weapons states in world affairs. The Chemical Weapons Convention also could have done so, simply by adopting the same discriminatory approach established by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<p>
<b>QUESTION #3: Is the Chemical Weapons Convention adequately verifiable?
<p>
ANSWER #3: Despite elaborate and burdensome verification provisions, compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention cannot be adequately verified.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention is not adequately verifiable. Many lethal chemicals are common and have peaceful uses, and trying to keep track of all these chemicals throughout the world is an impossible task. In a devastating report prepared for the Defense Nuclear Agency in 1991, contractors stated: "Detecting most types of cheating [possible under the Chemical Weapons Convention] will be highly unlikely, if not impossible."  This committee itself was notified of the problems with verification during a June 23, 1994, hearing. At that hearing, then-Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey stated: "But, still, the chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale."
<p>
<b>QUESTION #4: Are the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention enforceable?
<p>
ANSWER #4: Violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention are likely to go unpunished.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Verification of compliance with an arms control agreement is not enough. The U.S. also must be able to do something if other countries are caught violating the agreement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention makes only a feeble attempt to address the question of enforcement. It states that unspecified sanctions can be imposed on a state that is violating the convention, either by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons or by the United Nations. Ultimately, the United Nations Security Council would have to impose penalties severe enough to change the behavior of an outlaw state.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The history of the Biological Weapons Convention provides an object lesson in what can go wrong with this agreement. Starting in the early 1980s, the U.S. acknowledged that it suspected the Soviet Union of violating the Biological Weapons Convention. Yet the U.S. never lodged a complaint with the U.N. Security Council, which is charged with resolving the Biological Weapons Convention's enforcement problems just as it would under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The reason for this inaction is clear: If the U.S. had lodged a complaint against the Soviet Union, Moscow simply would have vetoed any enforcement resolution brought before the U.N. Security Council. China and Russia will have an equivalent veto authority against enforcing the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention as they pertain to their programs.
<p>
<b>QUESTION #5: Does the Chemical Weapons Convention enhance U.S. national security?
<p>
ANSWER #5: By making arms control an end in itself, the Chemical Weapons Convention will not serve to protect U.S. national security.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This question establishes the most important test of arms control. Arms control is one of several means for achieving the goal of national security. It should never be thought of as an end in itself. Reduced arsenals are not always better. A comprehensive security strategy will make room for the tools of deterrence, defenses, and even offensive military operations, as well as arms control. In short, any arms control agreement must serve the supreme purpose of foreign policy, which is protecting the nation's security.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention does not meet this most basic test. The convention requires that the U.S. completely abandon its chemical deterrent. But this requirement will not enhance U.S. security. Since no country is compelled to join the convention, it will be perfectly legal for those that do not join to retain chemical weapons. And since it is unrealistic to expect countries which want to retain chemical weapons to join, the result cannot possibly be global chemical disarmament. It makes no sense for America to give up its chemical weapons if, as a practical matter, other nations still possess them. By way of analogy, would it be in the U.S. interest to conclude a similar agreement relative to nuclear weapons?  Such an agreement would require the U.S. to dispense with its nuclear arsenal even though some other countries may retain nuclear weapons. This is no longer an academic question. India, among other nations, is demanding that the U.S. commit to such an agreement in principle at the negotiations over banning nuclear tests at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The precedent set by U.S. ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention would indicate that the U.S. is willing to accept a similar agreement attempting to ban nuclear weapons.
<p>
<b>TOWARD AN EFFECTIVE COUNTER-PROLIFERATION POLICY: THREE PRINCIPLES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention is not just an arms control agreement; it is also a non-proliferation agreement. As such, it carries important implications for U.S. non-proliferation policy. While the U.S. has a clear interest in stopping the proliferation of chemical weapons around the world, an effective counter-proliferation policy cannot depend on arms control alone. A truly effective policy will balance arms control with deterrence, effective chemical defenses, and, if necessary, military options for destroying chemical weapons and weapons facilities. As the Senate considers the merits of the Chemical Weapons Convention, it should ask whether it is part of an overall counter-proliferation policy that rests on the following three principles. 
<p>
<b>PRINCIPLE #1: The need to deter a chemical attack.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Deterrence requires maintaining a credible threat to retaliate for chemical attacks against the U.S. or its allies. This retaliatory threat must be able to convince any potential aggressor that he has nothing to gain by attacking the U.S. with chemical weapons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By requiring the destruction of chemical weapons, the Chemical Weapons Convention would deny the U.S. the capability to retaliate in kind for a chemical attack. America therefore would be left with only two options in case of a chemical attack: 1) to escalate the conflict by launching large-scale counter-attacks with conventional (non-chemical and non-nuclear) arms, or 2) to retaliate with nuclear weapons. But the Clinton Administration has not made the adjustments necessary to deal with these options. Not only is it cutting the conventional forces needed to deter chemical attacks; it also has not declared that nuclear weapons have a role in deterring chemical weapons attacks.
<p>
<b>PRINCIPLE #2: The need for defenses against chemical weapons.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are no guarantees, however, that deterrence will always work. Such dictators as Saddam Hussein and Muammar Qadhafi may not act rationally in a crisis or exhibit restraint. Therefore, the U.S. needs some insurance against chemical attack if deterrence fails; it needs defenses against chemical weapons and their delivery systems. U.S. forces need to be outfitted with garments, masks, and decontamination kits, and they need to be defended as well from aircraft and missiles which may carry chemical munitions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There certainly is room for improvement in chemical defenses. The General Accounting Office's Director of Army Issues, Richard Davis, testified before Congress on April 16, 1991, that America's soldiers were neither adequately trained nor equipped to conduct operations in an environment contaminated by chemical weapons. Although some progress has been made in improving the chemical defense posture of U.S. forces during the intervening years, it is unlikely that all the vulnerabilities cited by Mr. Davis in 1991 have been eliminated. As for defenses against the delivery systems used to launch chemical attacks, the Clinton Administration has cut funding for the nation's missile defense program by more than 50 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Furthermore, if history is any guide, the Chemical Weapons Convention will make it politically difficult to field better defenses. In 1969, President Nixon announced that the U.S. would forswear the use or development of biological weapons in preparation for the Biological Weapons Convention in 1972. After the Nixon decision, the U.S. biological defense program withered. This outcome was not the result of a provision in the Biological Weapons Convention outlawing defenses; it was the result of constant criticism of these programs by arms control advocates who viewed them as contrary to the spirit, although not the letter, of the Biological Weapons Convention. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The unintended consequences of the Biological Weapons Convention surfaced during the Persian Gulf War. An interim report to Congress on the results of the Gulf War stated that America's biological defense capabilities were so weak that if the Iraqis had used biological weapons, which later evidence shows they possessed, the casualty levels would have overwhelmed the military medical care system.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This same sort of vulnerability to chemical attack is likely to be the unintended consequence of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The convention does not outlaw defensive programs, yet arms control advocates are sure to lobby against defenses. The argument will go that they are not needed because chemical weapons have been banned.
<p><b>
PRINCIPLE #3: The need for offensive capabilities.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Defensive systems are not the sole means for countering a chemical attack. U.S. armed forces can destroy preemptively an enemy's chemical weapons and weapons facilities with air strikes and other forms of offensive combat operations. Targets for such strikes should include chemical production facilities and storage depots, as well as forces armed with chemical munitions. Destruction of the production facilities and storage depots would limit the enemy's supply of weapons, and targeting enemy forces armed with chemical munitions would lessen the chances chemical munitions will be used against U.S. and allied forces.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration should be required to devise a comprehensive strategy for destroying enemy weapons and facilities in time of war. It can do so by continuing and improving Pentagon programs already underway. The Air Force has conducted "sensor to shooter" experiments with the aim of devising a system for directing attacks against enemy forces within minutes of detection. The Navy has an equivalent concept called the "cooperative engagement capability."  These programs need to be coordinated and focused on destroying the weapons and forces capable of delivering chemical munitions.
<p>
<b>REDRAFTING THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention is a flawed agreement. Likewise, the existing U.S. policy to counter chemical attacks also is flawed. Neither is solely the fault of the Clinton Administration. The decisions to conclude and sign the convention and to change U.S. policy toward countering chemical attacks were made by the Bush Administration.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nevertheless, the Clinton Administration has chosen not to alter the policies begun by the Bush Administration. As the Clinton Administration proceeds down the same path, it will be up to the Senate, as it considers the Chemical Weapons Convention, to adopt a different approach. It can do so through the advice and consent process established by the United States Constitution for approving the ratification of treaties. As it does so, it should consider that:
<p>
<b>1. A chemical weapons treaty should be modeled on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two treaties serve as models for agreements on controlling weapons of mass destruction throughout the world: the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 and the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Biological Weapons Convention is a discredited treaty. It seeks to ban biological weapons in their entirety by requiring all participating states, including the U.S., not to develop and deploy biological weapons. But it is now known that the Biological Weapons Convention was violated by the Soviet Union from the beginning. Further, a report issued by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency on May 30, 1995, states that China, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Russia, and Taiwan either definitely have or may have violated the terms of the convention. In most of the listed cases, it is impossible to determine with absolute precision because compliance with the convention cannot be verified. Further, the report states that Egypt and Syria may have biological weapons programs. These two countries have signed but not ratified the Biological Weapons Convention. Thus, despite the evidence that other countries retained biological weapons, the U.S. has destroyed its biological deterrent. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, by contrast, has been relatively successful. While it has not prevented the spread of nuclear weapons, it has limited proliferation significantly. Today only a handful of countries outside the five declared nuclear states have nuclear weapons. More important, the Non-Proliferation Treaty did not require the elimination of the U.S. nuclear deterrent. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration could have resolved many of the problems with the Chemical Weapons Convention by sending the treaty back to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament to be redrafted. The Administration, unfortunately, chose not to take this step. The Senate has the option of concluding that the treaty is flawed. If this conclusion were reached, the Senate could request that the Clinton Administration renegotiate the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention so that it is modeled on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the Clinton Administration resists, there is a second alternative available to the Senate. The advice and is not limited to approving or disapproving ratification. The Senate can amend the text of a treaty. Through this amendment process, the Senate itself can redraft the Chemical Weapons Convention so that it resembles the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Doing so would require amending the convention in several articles. After adopting these amendments, the Senate then could approve its ratification. The practical effect would be that the Clinton Administration would have to ask other treaty signatories to accept the changes made by the Senate. Thus, the net effect would be a demand to renegotiate the treaty.
<p>
<b>2. A new policy is needed to deter chemical weapons strikes.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Changing the Chemical Weapons Convention itself, however, will not address the threat to U.S. security posed by chemical weapons. This would require changing the overall chemical weapons policy adopted by the Bush Administration. The policy established by President Bush on May 13, 1991, essentially committed the U.S. to the unconditional elimination of its chemical arsenal. This policy should be dropped, and the U.S. should state it will preserve the broadest possible array of responses to a chemical attack, including retaliation with conventional military means, an in-kind response, and, in the most extreme circumstances, a nuclear response. Further, it should not describe the specific circumstances under which it will resort to any particular response, in order to retain the greatest deterrent effect possible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While it would be preferable that the Clinton Administration make these changes in U.S. chemical deterrence policy, the Senate also can take actions that result in the same changes. First, the Chemical Weapons Convention would have to be amended to permit a U.S. chemical deterrent. Second, the Senate could adopt a reservation -- a means by which the Senate can qualify its approval of ratification -- that declares that the U.S. reserves the option of retaliating against a chemical attack with nuclear weapons. It must be acknowledged, however, that in order to adopt such a reservation the Senate may first be required to strike Article XXII of the convention. Article XXII bars reservations. Striking Article XXII is something that should be of general interest to the Senate in any event. Barring reservations narrows the freedom of action of the Senate in terms of its advice and consent role. The Senate should not accept any provisions in this convention or any future treaty that so limits its freedom of action.
<p>  
<b>3. U.S. defenses against chemical weapons need to be improved. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pursuing an effective defense program is not prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention, even as currently drafted. In fact, the convention explicitly allows for the continuation of defense programs. The danger is that the implementation process will be hijacked by arms control advocates who oppose such programs and who will undermine them with calls for budget cuts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Senate can counter these pressures on U.S. chemical defense programs in three ways. First, it can provide adequate funding levels for chemical defense programs in the annual authorization and funding bills for the Department of Defense. But since the funding question is under the jurisdiction of other Senate committees, the Foreign Relations Committee may prefer to focus on establishing clearly defined standards for the military in terms chemical defense preparedness. A condition could be attached to the resolution of ratification that requires the Secretary of Defense to certify that the Department of Defense has met the requirements for improving chemical defense preparedness made by Richard Davis of the General Accounting Office in testimony before Congress. These include meeting minimum chemical training standards set forth in service regulations and properly integrating chemical defense training into the overall training program for U.S. troops. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Senate should also set requirements for improving U.S. defenses against delivery vehicles used to launch chemical attacks, particularly ballistic missiles. This must include a requirement for the development and deployment of missile defenses capable of effectively destroying chemically armed ballistic missiles in the boost phase. The Senate could force this outcome by adopting a condition requiring the Administration to propose such a boost-phase defense for deployment by a specific date.
<p>
<b>4. The U.S. capability to destroy chemical weapons production and storage facilities, as well as deployed forces with chemical weapons, should be improved.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Defensive systems cannot meet all the requirements for defending U.S. and allied forces and civilians against chemical attack. These can be met only by maintaining offensive capabilities for striking at enemy positions. For example, countering enemy artillery firing chemical munitions requires an offensive response with opposing artillery or air strikes, as does interrupting enemy command and control networks and destroying chemical production and supply facilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. proved during the Persian Gulf War that it has an effective deep strike capability. Many command and control centers, for example, were destroyed by U.S. air power in and around Baghdad. But this is not to say that improvements cannot be made. For example, the U.S. had trouble countering Iraqi mobile <I>Scud</I> missiles with air power. To deal with this problem, the military services, and the Air Force and Navy in particular, have launched programs which are focused on enhancing the U.S. ability to strike quickly and accurately at enemy forces and facilities. The Senate should direct the Department of Defense to coordinate these programs and focus them on countering weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, including chemical weapons. The Senate again has the option of adopting a condition during its advice and consent process that forces the Clinton Administration to continue these programs and gear them to meeting the weapons of mass destruction threat.
<p>
<b>5. The Chemical Weapons Convention's arms control enforcement mechanisms need to be strengthened. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are three problems with U.S. policy for enforcing compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention. First, the Chemical Weapons Convention has a built-in conflict of interest in terms of enforcement. By establishing the U.N. Security Council as the court of last appeal in its enforcement process, the convention will allow the U.N. Security Council's five permanent members to veto any pending resolution ordering sanctions against it for an alleged violation. Any attempt to impose sanctions -- on China, for example -- for violating the convention are doomed to failure at the outset. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This problem can be resolved by redrafting the Chemical Weapons Convention along the lines of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Since the redrafted convention would establish declared chemical weapons states, it would be logical that these states be the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, thereby eliminating the conflict of interest. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second enforcement problem is that the U.S. historically has been reluctant to take action to remedy a violation by an arms control treaty partner. Despite clear evidence of Soviet violations of the Biological Weapons Convention and the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the U.S. did not take the proportionate steps allowed to it under international law. Thus, the violations went unpunished. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Solving this problem will require a change in the government process for handling these issues. Currently, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency reports annually on arms control treaty violations, but there is no requirement for follow-up. Ultimately, the law could be changed to require that the President propose a proportionate response to a reported treaty violation no later than 60 days after the report is issued. This would guarantee a substantive response once a violation is discovered. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The third problem is addressing the actions of states that refuse to ratify or accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention. This can be dealt with only by retaining a strong military posture that can deter and, if necessary, retaliate against a chemical attack. This is the ultimate insurance policy, but it can be maintained over the long term only by the actions of a Congress determined to fund and supervise America's defense programs.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Meeting the chemical weapons threat requires redrafting the Chemical Weapons Convention to declare that a few countries, including the U.S., are weapons states. It also requires a policy under which the U.S. reserves the right and capability to respond to chemical attack either in kind or with nuclear weapons, in addition to conventional means.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Perhaps the best example in history of a successful deterrence policy came during World War II. Despite the existence of chemical arsenals, chemical weapons were not used widely during that conflict. The reason: The Allied powers, including the United States, convinced the Axis that the use of such weapons would result in swift retaliation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. may now be throwing away this successful policy. By adopting the Chemical Weapons Convention and declaring a unilateral policy of neither maintaining nor using chemical weapons, even in retaliation, the U.S. would eliminate its chemical deterrent even though it could never be sure that potential enemies have taken equivalent steps. U.S. national security interests demand that this process be reversed. The U.S. must not abandon its ability to deter attacks with chemical weapons.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When the new Congress took charge in January 1995, the House and Senate leadership promised fundamental overhaul of the federal government. Included among the many proposed reforms was the closing or consolidation of redundant and obsolete government agencies. The most visible manifestation of this effort was the call by House freshmen to shut down the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Commerce, Energy, and Education. Although this initiative was associated most closely with the more junior members of both houses, the goal of streamlining government by terminating programs and closing agencies also was embraced by the leadership, with Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) endorsing the Senate freshmen's plan to close four departments.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In sharp contrast to its record in past years, this time Congress actually followed through and achieved more than most observers expected, shutting down over 270 agencies, divisions, offices, and programs throughout the federal government. This performance is illustrated by the action taken on 41 independent agencies recommended for termination in a January 1995 Heritage Foundation study because of their obsolescence, redundancy, limited value, or regional focus.<sup>1</sup>  Excluding the five independent agencies that are not subject to the annual appropriations process,<sup>2</sup> Congress's record for the remaining 36 is:
<P><ul>
<li> 13 agencies terminated and $3.6 billion saved over the next five years.<p>
<li> Funding for 12 agencies substantially reduced (by 10 percent or more) and $2.2 billion saved over five years.<p>
<li> No change or only limited change (funding cut by 10 percent or less) at 11 agencies and up to $40 million saved over the next five years.
</ul><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By taking significant action on 25 (or 70 percent) of the targeted agencies, this Congress reversed years of inaction on outmoded programs that had enjoyed uninterrupted growth in their budgets. Of the 11 agencies sheltered from significant cuts or termination, all but one -- the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission, whose funding was tripled -- saw their funding either modestly reduced or frozen at 1995 levels. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But while Congress has done more than its fair share to reduce government waste, the President has opposed many of these efforts by vetoing five of the appropriations bills; a sixth is stalled in the Senate, threatened by a filibuster. Because these six bills contain most of the proposed agency terminations, only about $600 million of the $5.8 billion in potential savings has been signed into law by the President.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to this progress in dealing with the 41 agencies cited in the January Heritage report, considerable success was achieved in dealing with scores of other obsolete programs, many of which were identified in <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/townhall_shop/roll.html"><I>Rolling Back Government: A Budget Plan to Rebuild America</I></a>, the Heritage blueprint for a radical downsizing of the federal government.<sup>3</sup>  In the Cabinet departments reviewed in Rolling Back Government, 251 programs or program offices were shut down or consolidated, and another 56 were cut significantly. In addition, Congress shut down eight programs within the legislative branch. Program terminations and reductions of this magnitude, in addition to being unprecedented, are a key component of Congress's $23 billion overall reduction in discretionary spending from last year's level.<sup>4</sup>4
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is obvious that tremendous progress was made in cutting wasteful, obsolete, and redundant federal programs during the first session of the 104th Congress, but much more can be done. Congress and the President should revisit many of the independent agencies that survived, including those that were substantially reduced, and make additional cuts and terminations as appropriate. Reformers should keep an especially close watch on those agencies that are scheduled for shutdown or consolidation to guard against end runs in Congress and last-minute presidential vetoes designed to keep these unneeded programs in business. 
<P>

<b>THE CRITERIA FOR CLOSURE</b>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When reviewing government programs for possible phaseout and funding reductions, lawmakers in each case should assess the program's value and whether it is truly national in scope. This means asking four questions:
<P>
1) Is the service provided by another government department or agency?
<p>
2) Is the agency amenable to management efficiencies through consolidation?
<p>
3) Can the agency's responsibilities be justified in an era of competing needs and limited resources?
<p>
4) Is the agency's principal focus of regional rather than national interest?
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Examples of the wasteful replication of public services include the many different agencies and offices tasked with nuclear safety. One of these, the Office of Nuclear Waste Negotiation, was allowed to go out of business last year. Among the many similar agencies that remain are the <a href="http://www.nrc.gov/">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a> (the largest and oldest), the newer and much smaller Defense Nuclear Facilities Board, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, and the Presidential Commission on Catastrophic Nuclear Disasters. In addition to these overlapping independent agencies, the Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Performance Assessment, Office of Nuclear Safety Enforcement, Office of Nuclear Safety Policy and Standards, Office of Radiological Oversight, and Division of Transportation and Packaging Safety all perform similar functions. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While one could argue that there is no such thing as too much nuclear safety, this scattershot approach, with independent offices spread throughout Washington, means costly replication.<sup>5</sup>  More troublesome from a safety perspective is the potential for unintentional lapses and gaps in oversight because of divided responsibility, communications difficulties, and excessive overhead at the expense of safety initiatives. Typical of this problem is the recent disclosure that the Department of Energy wasted $59 million on an uncompleted "Waste Management Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement." <sup>6</sup>
<P>

<b>Achieving Efficiency Through Consolidation</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even when the specific responsibilities of independent agencies are decidedly different, their functions may be sufficiently similar to allow for management efficiencies through consolidation. This can reduce costs and allow more federal financial resources to go directly to the intended beneficiaries rather than to administering bureaucrats. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Examples of federal administrative redundancy include the scholarship funds established to honor prominent Americans. The Barry Goldwater Scholarship Foundation and the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental Policy Foundation, while worthy in purpose, are also top-heavy with bureaucratic burdens that diminish their ability to achieve their mandated purpose. According to the President's FY 1996 budget, the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation will spend $1.13 million to provide $2 million in scholarships, and the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation will spend $986,000 to provide just $1,008,000 in fellowships to students. A dollar spent on excessive administrative overhead is a dollar denied a student or scholar. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A better way to honor America's leaders would be to consolidate these scholarship programs within a single foundation or existing agency already involved in making academic grants, such as the National Science Foundation or the Department of Education. This would reduce overhead costs substantially. Given the modest size of each of these programs, it makes no sense to maintain five separate accounting departments, five mailrooms, five travel budgets, five costly executives, five executive assistants, and five versions of all the other services needed to operate a scholarship program. 

<P>
<b>Low-Priority Agencies </b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Other independent agencies perform functions that, while possibly interesting and important to a few, cannot be justified in an era when available government resources are far short of what is needed to satisfy more pressing national goals. If the Department of State and Department of Defense are fulfilling their missions adequately, taxpayers are entitled to ask why additional millions of dollars are spent on the Institute of Peace, the North-South Center, or the Japan-United States Friendship Commission. Apparently many Members of Congress agree, because two of these agencies were subjected to significant cutbacks last year. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Similarly, do the President and Members of Congress really need a Commission of Fine Arts, at a cost of nearly $1 million a year in salaries and administrative expenses, to advise them on matters of architecture, painting, and sculpture?  Apparently they still think so, because the 104th Congress chose to keep it fully funded for another year. Fortunately, the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities were not so lucky; they were subjected to major cuts last year. 

<p>
<b>Agencies of Regional Interest </b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some programs have purely regional benefits and no national impact. Examples are the several independent agencies conducting special programs for specific East Coast river basins, such as the Susquehanna River Basin Commission. These programs may have some significance for specific states or regions, but they provide little direct value beyond that. Congress apparently agrees, because all of these regionally focused agencies are scheduled to shut down or lose their federal financial support this year.
<P>

<center><h2>STATUS OF AGENCIES IN THE HERITAGE REPORT</h2></center>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Below is a brief summary of the 36 agencies identified in the January 1995 Heritage study. In each case, the review indicates what action has been taken, how much money will be saved for taxpayers over the next five years, and whether the White House has signed the necessary legislation into law.
<p>
<center><h3>Agencies Congress Voted to Close Down</h3></center>
<P>
<b>Administrative Conference of the United States
<P>
Purpose:</b> Assists the President, Congress, and federal departments in improving the efficiency, adequacy, and fairness of the administrative procedures used within government and with private citizens.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Given the general agreement within Congress and the executive branch on the need for a fundamental overhaul of the way government does business and serves the public, it is apparent that the Conference has little to show for the millions of taxpayer dollars it has spent in its 30 years of existence. The Commission should be abolished in favor of more comprehensive and more promising efforts being considered in Congress or recommended by the Administration's own National Performance Review.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has passed legislation to terminate the Conference and appropriated $600,000 for 1996 to cover the costs associated with the shutdown. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $9.5 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed the legislation into law.

<p>
<b>Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations
<p>
Purpose:</b> Examines federal, state, and local trends, events, and programs that affect intergovernmental relations and makes recommendations as appropriate.
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Despite its stated purpose, the Commission has never played a serious role in the debate concerning levels of government in the federal system. Key debates and decisions on issues such as revenue sharing, unfunded mandates, interstate commerce, and transport generally have been handled elsewhere as mayors, governors, Congress, and the President work together to resolve problems and develop policy.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has passed legislation to terminate the Conference, and $784,000 has been appropriated to cover termination expenses and final work products.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $4.8 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed the bill into law.

<p>
<b>Commission on National Community Service
<p>
Purpose:</b> Established in 1990 to encourage all citizens, especially young people, to engage in community service. Makes grants to states and other entities to create service opportunities for students and out-of-school youth.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> America has an extensive tradition of volunteer work and charitable giving, most of it oriented toward locally based community service organizations. It is a waste of taxpayer dollars for the federal government to encourage Americans to do what they already are doing in great numbers.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> The Commission was merged last year into the Corporation for National and Community Service, which Congress has scheduled for termination this year. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Approximately $250 million to $300 million, based on FY 1995 spending of $54.4 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> No action is necessary on the Commission, but President Clinton has vetoed proposed termination of the Corporation, as discussed below.

<p>
<b>National Community Service Program
<p>
Purpose:</b> As one of two main components of the Corporation for National and Community Service, this program is supposed to encourage Americans to engage in volunteer work and community service. President Clinton's AmeriCorps is part of this program and exists to pay stipends and other financial benefits to "volunteers."
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> America's extensive tradition of volunteer work does not require federal involvement or financial support.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress voted to terminate the Corporation's National Community Service Program. (See next section for proposed cutbacks in other programs operated by the Corporation.)
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $2.862 billion. 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> The President has vetoed the appropriations bill which included this termination.

<p>
<b>Delaware River Basin Commission
<p>
Purpose:</b> Participates jointly with basin states -- Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania -- in the development of regional water and related resources. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> The benefits of the Commission's activities accrue mostly to the contiguous states in the Delaware River Basin. Therefore, these states should fund the program in its entirety. There is no reason for federal taxpayers to fund costly programs of strictly regional interest and benefit.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress ended federal support for the Commission this year and has provided final payment of $343,000 to facilitate the transition to self-sufficiency.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $4.3 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed this bill into law. 
<p>

<b>FDIC Affordable Housing and Bank Enterprise
<p>
Purpose:</b> Offers select properties in inventory to eligible households and organizations for low-income housing. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> The Enterprise competes directly with the objectives and programs of HUD, as well as with those of numerous state and local programs with a similar purpose. Experience demonstrates that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has had a difficult enough time pursuing its main purpose -- promoting the safety and soundness of banks -- and ought not to involve itself in the difficult task of attempting to house the poor. The Enterprise should be terminated or consolidated with similar housing programs.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress enacted legislation to terminate the program, arguing that "[g]iven the plethora of housing programs already in existence through HUD and other federal housing agencies... the Committee questions the value of yet another program, no matter the merit of its intent." 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $82.1 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has vetoed the appropriations bill which included this termination.

<p>
<b>Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts
<p>
Purpose:</b> Provides Native Americans with an opportunity to obtain post-secondary education in various fields of Indian art and culture. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation:</b> It is unwise for the federal government to be in the business of directly funding studies in one culture in preference to others. Existing student loan and grant programs from other sources can be used to support post-secondary education for eligible students through accredited institutions of learning. The program should be terminated or consolidated with other scholarship funds or related programs.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress provided the Institute with $5.5 million this year, compared with $11.5 million last year, with the understanding that federal funding will be phased out. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $56.6 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which terminated the Institute.

<p>
<b>Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin
<p>
Purpose:</b> Created on behalf of the four contiguous states and the District of Columbia to promote water pollution abatement and control and manage water and land resources in the Potomac River Basin. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Responsibility for the funding and management of this commission should rest entirely with the District and the affected states.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress provided the Commission with a payment of $511,000 as final year funding for the orderly transition to self-sufficiency.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $2.3 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed the bill into law.
<p>

<b>Office of Nuclear Waste Negotiator</b>
<p>
<b>Purpose:</b> To find a state or Indian tribe willing to host a nuclear waste site. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation:</b> As with other independent agencies concerned with nuclear issues, this office should be consolidated with another independent agency, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or with the appropriate division within the Department of Energy or the Environmental Protection Agency.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action: </b>The Office was allowed to expire in early 1995. A number of these agencies are scheduled to self-destruct, and no specific congressional action is required. Indeed, as last year's government shutdowns indicated, most discretionary programs are of this nature.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $1 million per year.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> No action required.

<p>
<b>Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation<P>


Purpose:</b> Performs a variety of real estate development functions, including design, land acquisition, and construction of projects related to the improvement of the Pennsylvania Avenue corridor connecting the White House with the Capitol.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Since its creation in 1972, the Corporation has invested millions of tax dollars in this one-mile stretch of road, turning the once-decrepit strip of deteriorated buildings into one of <I>Scenic America</I>'s ten "Most Scenic Byways."  Although this task was fulfilled years ago, the Corporation continues to receive substantial public funds for commercial real estate development activities best left to the private sector.
<P>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has enacted legislation to terminate the Corporation by April 1, 1996, and has authorized the use of prior year funds to facilitate the shutdown. Real estate development in progress will be transferred to the U.S. General Services Administration. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $245 million. 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill terminating the Corporation. 

<p>
<b>State Justice Institute
<P>
Purpose:</b> Established in 1984 to make grants and undertake activities to improve the administration of justice in the United States.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Continued high crime rates and public disappointment in the behavior of the court system over the past several years suggest that the Institute has not much to show for its costly ten-year effort to improve America's administration of justice.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress appropriated $5 million to provide for the orderly phaseout of direct federal support. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $67.5 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> The President vetoed the appropriations bill which included termination of the Institute.

<p>
<b>Susquehanna River Basin Commission
<p>
Purpose:</b> Participates jointly with affected states in the development of water and related resources in the Susquehanna River Basin. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> As with similar commissions, the responsibility for funding and management should be turned over to the contiguous states.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress enacted legislation to withdraw federal support from the Commission and provided $318,000 to facilitate the transition to self-sufficiency. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $1.3 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed this into law.
<P>

<b>Thomas Jefferson Commemorative Commission</b>
<p>
<b>Purpose:</b> Established to honor the 250th anniversary of Jefferson's birth. The anniversary occurred in 1993.
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Despite the passing of the anniversary three years ago, $31,000 was scheduled to be spent in FY 1995 and another $25,000 in FY 1996 for post-birthday events. Because it has met its stated objective, there is little or no reason for the Commission to exist.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action: </b>The Commission was allowed to expire, and no federal spending is scheduled after this fiscal year. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $500,000.
<P>
<b>White House Action:</b> No action is required to fulfill such a previously scheduled expiration.

<p>

<center><h3>Agencies Congress Voted to Cut Substantially</h3></center>
<P>

<b>Advisory Council on Historic Preservation
<p>
Purpose:</b> Provides independent advice to the President and Congress relating to the national historic preservation program. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Historic preservation, including the development of appropriate policies, should be a local responsibility. The only exception might be for landmarks of national significance, and these cases can be handled by the U.S. National Park Service and its Division of Cultural Resources.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has voted to reduce the Council's FY 1996 funding by 15 percent, down to $2.5 million from last year's $2.94 million, and advises the Council to find ways to be reimbursed by government agencies for which it provides a service. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $2.5 million. 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill that included this funding cut.
<p>


<b>Appalachian Regional Commission</b>
<p>
<b>Purpose:</b> Provides guidance and financial assistance to the 13 Appalachian states for basic facilities and support to promote economic growth in the region. Programs focus on transportation access and on community, business, and human development. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Although it is one of the more costly independent agencies, there is no convincing evidence that the ARC, after more than 30 years of operation, has been effective in creating new jobs or capital investment. In practice, it serves largely as a source of pork-barrel spending for the region's politicians. West Virginia, a focus of much of the Commission's attention, is still poor and becoming poorer relative to the rest of the country. The per capita income of West Virginia's population ranked 43rd in the country in 1980 but fell to 46th by 1994, and its unemployment rate is consistently one of the highest in the country. It is time to try something new for the problems of West Virginia and other Appalachian states -- such as tax cuts, enterprise zones, school choice, and deregulation.
<P>
<b>Congressional Action: </b> Finally recognizing the failure of pork-barrel projects to spur growth, this Congress slashed the Commission's budget by 40 percent, appropriating only $170 million for 1996 compared with $282 million last year. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $568.6 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed the bill into law.
<p>

<b>Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
<p>
Purpose:</b> Advises the President and Secretary of State on arms control, non-proliferation, and disarmament activities and participates in negotiations with other countries. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> As a product of the Cold War, ACDA largely has fulfilled its mission by a series of nuclear, conventional, and chemical weapons agreements. For many years, ACDA has been overshadowed by other U.S. agencies, particularly the State, Energy, and Defense Departments, in its pursuit of disarmament. The Agency is outmoded and duplicative and should be abolished, with arms control issues mandated to other, more appropriate agencies.
<P>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has reduced the Agency's budget by 34 percent, cutting it from $54.4 million last year to $35.7 this year. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $101.5 million. 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> The President has vetoed the appropriations bill which included these cuts.
<p>

<b>Corporation for National and Community Service
<p>
Purpose:</b> Engages Americans of all ages and backgrounds in community-based service focused on the nation's educational, human, public safety, and environmental needs.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Given America's proud tradition of volunteerism and charitable giving, much of it oriented toward locally based community service organizations, it is a waste of federal dollars to encourage Americans to do what they already do in great numbers.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has enacted legislation to terminate the largest of the Corporation's programs, the National Community Service Program, which includes AmeriCorps (see previous section). The House and Senate have yet to agree on spending for the Corporation's Domestic Volunteer Service Programs, which include such programs as VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America); the Senate has passed cuts from 1995 levels of 6 percent, while the House has reduced spending by 14 percent.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $71.5 million (Senate bill) to $154 million (House bill). 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> An earlier version of this bill was vetoed by President Clinton. The appropriations bill in which these cuts were proposed is stalled in Senate.    
<p>

<b>East-West Center
<p>
Purpose:</b> Promotes better relations between the U.S. and the nations of Asia and the Pacific through cooperative programs of study, research, and training. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> The resources and talents of the State Department, which maintains a network of embassies and consulates in Asian and Pacific nations, should be sufficient to maintain good relations with these countries. Deficiencies that remain not likely to be rectified by the cooperative programs of the Center. 
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has cut the Center's budget by more than half (52 percent), reducing this year's spending to $11.75 million from $24.5 million in 1995. The House actually proposed to terminate the Center; the large cut reflects compromise with Senate. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $70.3 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has vetoed the appropriations bill that included this cut.

<P>
<b>Institute of Peace
<p>
Purpose:</b> Conducts and supports research and scholarship in the fields of international peace and conflict resolution. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Although the world remains a dangerous place, responsibility for maintaining and enhancing peace should remain with the State and Defense Departments, in cooperation with Congress and the multilateral organizations to which the United States belongs and contributes. The scholarly endeavors of the Peace Institute replicate, at taxpayer expense, the efforts of academics and private research organizations concerned with international relations.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> A successful Senate filibuster against the appropriations bill that would fund the Institute makes the outcome uncertain; the House voted for a nearly 50 percent cut, while the Senate proposed to maintain funding at last year's level. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $16.1 million assuming House-Senate conferees split the difference and cut the Institute's budget by nearly 25 percent.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> Necessary legislation is stalled in the Senate.
<p>

<b>Legal Services Corporation
<p>
Purpose:</b> Funds private attorneys, nonprofit organizations, and state and local agencies to provide free civil legal assistance to the poor. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Financed in part by federal dollars and tasked with providing legal representation for the poor, Corporation-supported lawyers and grantees frequently have used their positions and resources to pursue political and lobbying activities. These efforts have included such things as legal action against welfare reform, Proposition 187 (California's immigration reform), and state and local tax reductions, to name just a few. Given its history of political activism, and given the substantial funding the legal services system receives from non-federal sources, taxpayer support should be ended and the Corporation privatized.<sup>7</sup>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Corporation serves largely as a source of federal tax dollars for approximately 323 locally based grantees -- such as the Legal Aid Society of Central Texas and the Food Research Action Center -- that do the actual legal work. In addition to receiving taxpayers' money through the Corporation, these grantees in 1993 also received an additional $245 million from other sources, including IOLTA (Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts) funds, state and local grants, and private and nonprofit contributions. Moreover, the legal profession provides significant amounts of pro bono work for needy clients and social issues. A privatized Corporation easily could build on this extensive funding base and work with state, national, and local bar associations to secure and enhance IOLTA and other private or nonprofit funding for grantees and provide a tighter focus for their representational work.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> After years of rapid spending growth, this Congress has achieved what many thought impossible by enacting significant cuts in the Corporation's budget, reducing it from $400 million in 1995 to $278 million this year. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $680.5 million.  
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> The President vetoed the appropriations bill which included this cut.

<p>
<b>Marine Mammal Commission
<p>

Purpose:</b> Coordinates America's marine mammal policy, reviews the status of the marine mammal population, and recommends conservation steps to relevant government departments. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> No other form of non-human life, endangered or otherwise, has its own commission. This costly precedent should be terminated. Existing federal programs, such as NOAA's Coastal Ecosystems Health and Recovering Protected Species programs, are tasked to perform similar responsibilities, as is the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service. 
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress passed legislation that would cut the Commission's budget by 14 percent, from $1.4 million in 1995 to $1.2 million in 1996.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $1.1 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which included these cuts.
<p>

<b>National Capital Arts and Cultural Affairs
<p>
Purpose:</b> Provides payments for general operating support to Washington, D.C., arts and other cultural organizations. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Citizens of Washington, D.C., and visitors to the city are the beneficiaries of major federally supported arts and cultural programs well in excess of what is available in other cities. Washington's culturally rich environment would scarcely notice the loss of this $7 million taxpayer-funded program.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress enacted legislation that would cut the Commission's budget by 20 percent, from $7.5 million last year to $6 million in 1996.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $8.3 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill that included these cuts.
<p>
<b>National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities</b>
<p>
<b>Purpose:</b> Umbrella organization for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and Institute of Museum Services. The NEA provides grants to and contracts with groups, individuals, and state and regional organizations engaged in or concerned with the arts. The NEH funds activities intended to improve the quality of education and teaching in the humanities.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> In recent years, Americans have had good reason to be concerned about efforts to promote government-sanctioned art, from public commissions to approve or reject architectural design, to requirements that some portion of a building's construction budget be devoted to art, to the bureaucratically approved and funded art of the NEA. The NEA should be closed down and American artists encouraged to turn their energies to winning private support for their creative endeavors rather than engaging in political grantsmanship.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Similarly, the NEH recently demonstrated its questionable judgment by producing, among other things, a breathtakingly distorted curriculum for the teaching of American history, thereby confirming the worst fears of those who argued that federal involvement in education would promote propaganda rather than the search for truth. It is time to terminate the NEH before doctrinaire bodies like the National Committee for History Standards further undermine education and the appreciation of American culture.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> After years of escalating spending, Congress finally has made deep cuts in the budgets of the NEA and NEH. These cuts reflect a comprise between the House and Senate, with the House preferring to terminate these programs within the next two years. In the compromise plan, the NEA's budget, including its matching grant program, will be cut 39 percent from $162.3 million in 1995 to $99.4 in 1996; the NEH budget, including matching grants, will be cut by 35 percent, from $172 million in 1995 to $112 million this year, yielding potential five-year savings of $333.2 million and a total of $682.5 million over the next five years for both agencies.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $349.3 million (NEA) and $333.2 million (NEH).
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill that included these cuts.
<p>

<b>National Commission on Libraries and Information Science
<p>
Purpose:</b> Responsible for developing plans to meet the library and information needs of the nation, and for coordinating federal, state, and local government activities to meet these needs. 
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> America's system of libraries -- most of them locally based and supported -- is the envy of the world. Moreover, the rapid technological advances taking place within the information industries promise unprecedented access to a wealth of information at modest cost. Much of this rapid change is driven by the profit-seeking private sector, and there is little need for government involvement, financial support, or expert guidance. The federal government's greatest contribution would be to get out of the way and not try to "coordinate" the explosive innovations in information technology.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Although the House and Senate have yet to agree on a final number, if they choose to split the difference between the two positions, the Commission's spending will be cut by 30 percent, from $901,000 in 1995 to $639,000 in 1996. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> $1.5 million (assuming final funding midway between the levels voted by each chamber)
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> The appropriations bill that includes these changes is stalled in the Senate.
<p>

<b>North-South Center</b>
<p>
<b>Purpose:</b> Promotes better relations between the United States, the nations of Latin America and the Caribbean, and Canada by bringing together scholars and students for cooperative study, training, and research.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> This program should be terminated in favor of long-standing activities of the State Department designed to sustain and improve relations within the Western Hemisphere. Improved commercial links, helped by the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement and the NAFTA, and increased private contacts by business people, academics, journalists, and tourists render the Center unnecessary. 
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress cut the Center's budget in half, saving $2 million this year.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $11 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which included these cuts.

<p>

<center><h3>Agencies That Escaped Significant Cuts</h3></center>

<b>Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad
<p>
Purpose:</b> Encourages the preservation of cemeteries, monuments, and historic buildings associated with the foreign heritage of the United States.
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation: </b>To reduce overhead and administrative cost, this task should be handled through the Foreign Service and cultural attaches in relevant U.S. embassies, using local contractors as appropriate.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress chose to maintain spending at last year's level.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which included the Commission's funding.

<p>
<b>Commission of Fine Arts
<p>

Purpose:</b> Advises the President, Congress, and department heads on matters of architecture, sculpture, painting, and other fine arts, particularly as they relate to the appearance of the nation's capital. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Congress already has its long-standing office of the Architect of the Capitol, whose skills, resources, and capabilities are more than adequate to the task of providing advisory services, either directly or through referral, for Members of Congress, the President, or any Cabinet head needing expert guidance and advice on the fine arts. The Commission does not create art; it reviews and judges the work of others, a role best played by the public at large at no cost to the taxpayer.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress chose to maintain spending at last year's level, despite the fact that the Commission's $834,000 budget is applied only to salaries and administrative expenses.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which included the Commission's funding.

<p>
<b>Commission on Civil Rights
<p>
Purpose:</b> Engages in studies concerning areas in which there may be denials of civil rights, and reports on these matters to the President and Congress. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation:</b> The Commission replicates the civil rights responsibilities of the federal government's many other civil rights offices, as described in the introduction to this study.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has cut the Commission's $9 million budget by only 3 percent and has not consolidated its operations with those of any other federal civil rights offices. 
<P>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill that included funding for the Commission.

<p>
<b>Corporation for Public Broadcasting
<p>
Purpose:</b> Provides grants to qualified public television and radio stations, to be used at their discretion for purposes related to program production and acquisition. The Corporation was established in 1968 to provide additional programming and support to the nation's non-commercial radio and television stations. Public broadcasting now includes nearly 600 radio stations and 340 television stations. This extensive nationwide system receives more than 80 percent of its support from sources other than the federal government, with contributions from subscribers and business accounting for its largest and second-largest sources of income. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> The CPB now provides 14 percent of the Public Broadcasting System's total financial support, the loss of which could be offset by greater reliance on other financial sources, improved management and administrative efficiency, and the elimination of low-priority programming and grant activities. The loss of federal dollars also could be offset by recouping some of the earnings of the many profitable production companies which share the subsidy and by selling commercial air time, particularly in time slots now devoted to CPB/PBS self-promotion and self-justification. Increasingly, CPB/PBS quality and content fall short of that available on the private sector's Arts & Entertainment Network, Discovery Channel, Learning Channel, and History Channel, as well as the growing number of competitors to CNN. These networks demonstrate that quality educational programming can be maintained in a commercial format and without federal financial support.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Unlike most other federal programs, the CPB is funded two years in advance, and this year's appropriation bills deal with FY 1998 funding. Although the House and Senate have yet to agree on a final 1988 spending target for the Corporation, their proposals either do not involve much of a reduction or would maintain current funding: The House proposes an 8 percent cut of $20 million, while the Senate would freeze the budget at the 1996 level of $260 million. Differences will not be resolved until a Senate filibuster against the Labor/HHS appropriations bill is broken.
<p>
<b>Three-Year Savings:</b> As high as $30 million (assuming the House and Senate split the difference); as high as $750 million (if the program is terminated). 
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> Necessary legislation is stalled in the Senate.
<p>

<b>Defense Nuclear Facilities Board<p>

Purpose:</b> Responsible for evaluating the content and implementation of standards related to defense nuclear facilities of the Department of Energy. Also investigates events or practices at defense nuclear facilities that may affect public health adversely. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation: </b>The Board is one of five independent agencies concerned with nuclear safety issues, as described in the introduction to this study. It should be consolidated with one of the other independent bodies concerned with nuclear arms and energy to improve congressional and executive branch oversight at less cost to the budget.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress has cut the Board's budget by only $900,000, just 5 percent less than last year's $17.9 million. 
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> At least $5 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed this into law.

<p>
<b>Japan-United States Friendship Commission</b>
<P>
<b>Purpose:</b> Makes grants to promote scholarly, cultural, and artistic activities between Japan and the United States. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Given the extensive business, cultural, academic, diplomatic, and political relationships between the United States and Japan, there is no shortage of interaction between the citizens and institutions of these two countries. The Friendship Commission's activities are both redundant and a waste of money.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Both houses of Congress have voted to maintain the Commission at $1.2 million, the same level of spending as last year.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has vetoed the appropriations bill that included these cuts.

<p>
<b>Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission
<p>
Purpose:</b> To formulate plans for a memorial to FDR. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Before his death, President Roosevelt requested that any memorial to him be simple, no larger than his desk, and placed near the National Archives. Although this request was fulfilled many years ago, Congress has persisted in trying to erect something grander. It should honor President Roosevelt by adhering to his request.
<P>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Notwithstanding FDR's request, the Memorial Commission is the only one of the 36 independent agencies discussed in this study to receive an increase in its budget -- in this case an increase of more than 200 percent to $147,000.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None; instead, taxpayers face a rise in spending of as much as $500,000 over the next five years if this is sustained.
<P>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the legislation that included this increase.

<p>
<b>National Capital Planning Commission
<p>
Purpose:</b> Central planning agency for the federal government in the national capital. 
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Washington, D.C., is unique among U.S. cities in having a federally funded planning commission to help guide its development. Whatever expertise this commission may bring to bear, however the economic and social environment of Washington still continues to deteriorate. In any case, planning activities should be undertaken by the D.C. government.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress would reduce the Commission's budget by only 9 percent to $5.09 million from last year's $5.65 million. This is in marked contrast to Congress's termination of the similarly mandated Pennsylvania Avenue Redevelopment Commission.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $2.8 million.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill which included these cuts.

<p>
<b>Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation<p>

Purpose:</b> Performs a number of functions intended to reverse neighborhood decline, develop housing strategies, and replicate successful neighborhood preservation strategies.
<P>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Programs of the Corporation duplicate those of HUD, particularly now that HUD has established its Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities program to focus resources more precisely on impoverished neighborhoods.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress voted to maintain last year's funding of $38.7 million despite the Corporation's duplication of HUD's $4 billion Community Development Block Grant program. Congress should revisit the issue and apply to it the same standards it applied to the now-terminated FDIC Affordable Housing Program.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<P>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has vetoed the appropriations bill which included these cuts.
<p>

<b>Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board
<p>
Purpose:</b> To evaluate the technical and scientific validity of the activities of the Department of Energy's nuclear waste disposal program. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination or Consolidation:</b> As with the Defense Nuclear Facilities Board, the responsibilities of this Board should be consolidated with those of another nuclear safety agency or department, as indicated in the introduction to this study.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Congress chose to maintain the status quo by making no change in prior year spending.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> None.
<p>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed this into law.

<p>
<b>Office of Government Ethics
<p>
Purpose:</b> Provides overall direction of executive branch policies designed to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure high ethical standards. 
<p>
<b>Rationale for Termination:</b> Recent significant ethical lapses within the executive branch and Congress suggest that the Office has been less than effective in imposing a higher ethical standard on government officials, notwithstanding the more than $8 million it spent in the last fiscal year. The enhancement of ethical conduct should be internal to each agency, and the monitoring of ethical standards should be the direct responsibility of the inspector general and general counsel of each department and agency. This ineffective Office should be terminated.
<p>
<b>Congressional Action:</b> Despite this office's ineffectiveness, Congress has reduced its budget by only 5 percent to $7.7 million in 1996.
<p>
<b>Five-Year Savings:</b> Estimated at $2.4 million.
<P>
<b>White House Action:</b> President Clinton has signed this into law.

<p>

<b>TERMINATION AND CONSOLIDATION OBJECTIVES FOR THE FY 1997 BUDGET</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While this analysis recommends the abolition of just 41 of the approximately 130 independent agencies, this should not be construed as endorsing the activities of the other agencies or their current levels of federal funding. These 41 agencies were chosen as best representing those that could and should be terminated. Many others should be subjected to close examination, funding reductions, fundamental reform, or abolition according to the criteria outlined in this study. In most cases, agencies excluded from the current list are of a size and significance that require more exhaustive analysis. Among these, the Small Business Administration, General Services Administration, and Federal Communications Commission are just a few of the remaining independent agencies that should be reviewed by Congress for termination, substantial cutbacks, or major reform.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/townhall_shop/roll.html"><I>Rolling Back Government: A Budget Plan to Rebuild America</I></a>, Heritage Foundation analysts systematically reviewed many of the larger independent agencies, as well as the many divisions and offices within the Cabinet agencies. That study made numerous recommendations for program termination, privatization, consolidation, and reform, and many of these recommendations were adopted by the appropriations committees when they proposed the termination of 259 programs in last year's appropriations bills. Many were not, however, and those that were overlooked during last year's attempt at budget reform should be revisited this year as potential candidates for restructuring or elimination.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In preparing to shut down the federal government in November 1995, before President Clinton's veto of the second continuing resolution to keep federal agencies operating, the Clinton Administration made the customary distinction between "essential" employees, who would remain on the job, and "non-essential" employees, who would be furloughed. For the U.S. Department of Education, the Clinton Administration determined that 4,394 of the department's 4,937 employees -- or 89 percent -- were "non-essential" and would be furloughed for the duration of the budget impasse.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unwittingly, the Clinton Administration confirmed what Congress should recognize: America does not need a federal Department of Education. Congress should take the opportunity afforded by the budget process to return to states, local governments, and parents the authority and responsibility for education.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On March 19, 1996, President Clinton submitted a budget to Congress that requested a 7.2 percent increase in FY 1997 discretionary funds for the <a href="http://www.ed.gov">Department of Education</a>.<sup>2</sup>  While the Administration makes certain attempts to realize savings through consolidation and reform of redundant and outdated programs, the proposal reflects an unquestioning commitment to an institution that has failed to prove its value in reaching the President's stated goal of giving "every single American citizen the education that all of us need to compete and win in the new century."  The education establishment has failed to demonstrate any positive correlation between federal education spending and education performance. It is time to rethink the role of the federal government in education, not to spend more money in the hope that programs which have not worked in the past somehow will be made to succeed with increased funding.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Created by Congress in 1979 at the request of President Jimmy Carter, the Department of Education is doing precisely what its severest critics envisioned: usurping local and state control of education by slowly and steadily introducing federal programs, rules, and requirements. Although the department accounts for about six percent of total public funding of education, its influence is out of all proportion to its financial role. Indeed, the Department of Education is inserting itself into almost all aspects of the day-to-day workings of the nation's 15,025 school districts. Bureaucratic, heavy-handed and intrusive, it is a metaphor for many of Washington's most wasteful and meddlesome domestic programs. As Chester E. Finn, Jr., former Assistant Secretary of Education during the Reagan Administration, noted in recent congressional testimony:
<p><blockquote>
	The federal education apparatus illustrates what has gone awry in Washington over the past several decades. The national government has become meddlesome, intrusive and bullying. It now impedes more than it fosters. Much of what it mandates or encourages is misguided. It keeps people from doing what they know is right for their children, communities and states. It substitutes the rules of distant bureaucrats for the on-site knowledge of parents and teachers. And, particularly in the last several years, it has begun to lift from our communities the sense that they are responsible for the renewal and reform of American education and to suggest, instead, that Washington knows best and is taking charge.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Why should the U.S. Department of Education be eliminated?  Its time has come and gone. It is time to restore common sense.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thanks to the Reserve Powers Clause in the Tenth Amendment, all powers not specifically delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states. Education is such a power; a federal role is both gratuitous and intrusive.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is time to restore federalism to its founding principles, and there is no area more fruitful than education. Despite the desperate need for reform, there is no master template--certainly not one originating in Washington--to improve the schools. States and localities are "laboratories of democracy"; reform should originate at these levels, not be imposed from on high.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pedagogy - -the art of teaching and learning -- is quintessentially local in nature. Indeed, it goes on at the classroom and individual level. The closer decision-making is to the student and teacher, the better.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal role is costly as well as intrusive, requiring an expensive and burdensome bureaucracy to manage national programs. Washington should do only those things states and localities cannot do for themselves, such as national data collection and targeted research.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The most alarming aspect of growing federal control of education is not administrative interference, however, but its adverse impact on academic performance, equally the product of sins of omission and commission. The increasing power of special-interest groups, the burgeoning size of school districts, the refusal of the public schools to submit to any market discipline, weakening community bonds, a pervasive anti-intellectualism in schools of education, general permissiveness, family dissolution -- all have played a role. At no time in American history has academic performance been more important. Yet, as the federal role has increased, education performance has declined. While cause and effect are elusive, and the department's supporters assert a variety of causes to explain the decline in student performance, these changes nonetheless occurred during, and as a part of, the federal ascendancy in American education.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<a href="bg1076c1.gif">Chart 1</a> illustrates how SAT scores have declined in the last 25 years as the federal role in education has increased. Since the creation of the department in 1979, scores have stagnated: In 1980, the national average was a combined 890; in 1994, the average was 910. What appears to be a small amount of progress could be attributed to changes in methodology on the SAT, which include a shortened test and permission to use calculators. In terms of graduation rates, the 8 percent of eighth graders who failed to complete high school in 1978 rose to 12 percent in 1992. In other measures of reading, science, and math ability, there has been some measurable improvement. When compared to the scores of other industrialized nations, however, it becomes clear that measuring success against where we were 20 years ago may not be sufficient if we still consistently lag behind other industrialized parts of the world, as <a href="bg1076c2.gif">Chart 2</a> illustrates. The United States spends more money per elementary and secondary school pupil than any other country, with little to show for such an investment (see <a href="bg1076t1.gif">Table 1</a>). How education money is spent is as important as the amount spent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even if the federal role has not been directly responsible for education decline, this is clearly not the time to do more of the same. Taxpayers should realize the obvious: The purpose of a federal role in education is to "federalize" the nation's schools, to make them march to a common drumbeat. And it is succeeding, to the detriment of education. At least since the advent of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, federal involvement in education has been designed to make each state more like the others.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not surprisingly, the descent to the lowest common denominator has been relentless. The inverse relationship between education performance and an increasingly intrusive federal education bureaucracy is so pronounced that it invites the most profound skepticism about any significant federal role in education. It is time for Congress to close down the Department of Education, reassign appropriate federal functions to their proper place in the national government, and return authority to those who really should be responsible for the nation's schools.

<P>
<b>THE ORIGINS OF THE DEPARTMENT</b>
<P>
<b>A Limited Federal Role</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1867, the federal government created a Department of Education to gather and disseminate statistics in order to improve the nation's public schools. The department was modeled after the Department of Agriculture, created in 1862 as a free-standing, sub-Cabinet-level federal agency, and was tasked with promoting the cause of education by publishing statistical reports and comparisons of school effectiveness. A bitter debate surrounded the establishment of the department as a free-standing agency, for although it was tasked only with data gathering and dissemination, many feared that it would grow to challenge state control of public schools. A coalition of Democrats and a wide spectrum of Republicans fought to abolish the department soon after its creation, and a compromise was reached, under which the office was moved to the Department of the Interior in 1868. The office continued to exist, but its influence was tempered by a Congress that allowed only modest increases in funding and personnel. Throughout the following century, amid several name changes and reorganizations, the agency played a carefully limited role in the development of federal education policy, with the Interior, Agriculture, and Labor departments also performing education-related functions.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the Office of Education grew, and so did its mission. In 1947, in the <i>Everson</i> case the U.S. Supreme court set the stage for increased federal involvement in education, establishing a precedent for federal involvement in state and local school policies by limiting public support for religious schooling. Two decades later, President Johnson's War on Poverty sought to improve the quality of and access to education with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. ESEA empowered the U.S. Office of Education to aid schools in low-income areas and strengthen state departments of education.<sup>5</sup>  The office performed analyses of state and local educational trends and gained authority to enforce racial discrimination guidelines. And while the Office of Education did not control curriculum, it supported a number of curriculum reform projects -- "new math" and MACOS (Man, A Course of Study), for example -- that were both intrusive and ineffectual. As the office distributed funds at the local level, it also required evaluations of regulatory compliance. No longer was the Office of Education merely a "statistical secretary" to the nation's schools.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1970s, education groups lobbied heavily for a Cabinet-level Department of Education. The National Education Association had long supported the creation of a Cabinet-level agency but had little support from Congress. President Jimmy Carter, in an effort to keep a campaign pledge, sought its creation soon after his inauguration. Overcoming opponents, supporters of a Cabinet-level department prevailed in 1979 with the Department of Education Organization Act, which passed easily in the Senate (72 to 21) but narrowly in the House (210 to 206).<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. Department of Education was created for the least defensible of reasons: politics. The education establishment desperately wanted its own Cabinet-level department, and creating it helped cement their political ties to liberals in Congress. In turn, a more pronounced federal role would raise the visibility of education and lead to more and more federal involvement in policymaking and funding. With such a dynamic in place, state and local education would become increasingly federalized. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the Department increased the power of education interest groups, however, two decades of test scores show that public education has become progressively weaker and more ineffective. As Chester Finn observes:
<p><blockquote>
	It became clear that the authors want to substitute decisions made in Washington for decisions made by individual households and communities. They create new governance mechanisms and regulatory apparatus at both national and state levels. They use federal funding in a deceptive way that is designed to elicit the very forms of behavior that other parts of the legislation term "voluntary."  They throw obstacles onto such promising reform pathways as school choice and private management of public schools. They transform what has been a national movement into a federal program.<sup>8</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department of Education thus was not, and is not, a child of carefully reasoned policy or pressing national need. It was the product of politics and is an instrument of interest group political power. That is why it behaves as it does. The calculus is straightforward: President Carter made a political promise and kept it. After decades of existence, a cautious and careful professional association -- the National Education Association (NEA) -- became politicized in the 1970s and 1980s. Determined to create a national education presence, the NEA had one overriding agenda: "one-third, one-third, one-third."  By this, the NEA meant that each level of government -- local, state, and federal -- would provide one-third of the total dollars for education.<sup>9</sup>  It also wanted a Department of Education to increase central control of education through an agency that would be influenced by organized teachers and administrators rather than parents. In exchange for the support of the National Education Association for his candidacy, Jimmy Carter and his liberal allies in Congress delivered a Cabinet department.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ironically, the department's severest critics included those who regard themselves as among American education's best friends. The concern at the time is best captured in <i>Washington Post</i> editorials opposing the creation of the department nearly 20 years ago:
<P><blockquote>
	If the House does agree to enshrine an insulated, supergraded federal educational bureaucracy in the Cabinet, the results are likely to be so costly and unhealthy for American education that many representatives, in retrospect, will be embarrassed to admit that they voted "yea."<sup>10</sup>
<p>

	We are not one-time offenders in this business.... [W]e are, in fact, hardened criminals, hopeless recidivists and probably -- why mince words?  -- incorrigibles. We have been fighting the creation of a separate Department of Education since 1953 [and] we remain adamantly opposed to the creation of this new department. We think it is an awful idea and nothing that has been said or that has happened in the last 26 years has given us reason to think otherwise -- including and especially the Carter administration's campaign in favor of it.<sup>11</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reason for such a reaction was that President Carter's proposal was startling even by Washington standards. There simply was no compelling organizational reason to create a Cabinet-level Department of Education, except to usurp state and local power -- a claim not even the most ardent supporter would make in public. It was a simple political payoff, obvious to everyone. Joining the <i>Post</i> in its opposition to the new department was the Committee Against a Separate Department of Education, created by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). Made up of education, research, labor, and civil rights groups from across the country, and including prominent figures such as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY), the committee was afraid that the new department would have a baleful effect on America's long and successful tradition of local control of education. According to Moynihan, the department was a result of a "backroom deal, born out of squalid politics."<sup>12</sup>  Gregory Humphrey, director of legislation for the AFT, likewise declared: 
<P><blockquote>
	 We believe this is a hoax. It will not result in the improvement of education anywhere. [Test scores and literacy measurements] are the things people think of when they want an improvement in education -- not who talks to the President and when, or how many assistant secretaries can dance on the head of a pin.<sup>13</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite this criticism, when President Reagan proposed to abolish the department just two years later, he was barely able to find an author to carry his legislation. The abolition proposal vanished without a trace. Congressional support for a Department of Education was no stronger than when the Department had been created, but just as Congress had little energy or enthusiasm for creating the department, it could not marshal the resolve to dismantle it. The new <i>status quo</i> triumphed. 
<p>

<b>A DEPARTMENT IN SEARCH OF A JUSTIFICATION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The failings of the Department of Education (and the Office of Education before it) have been sins of omission as much as sins of commission. It is not just that Department officials foisted such things as "bilingual education" on an unwilling nation; the department also forfeited tremendous opportunities. Had it been a force for a constructive new federalism, it could have partially justified its existence as a "bully pulpit" for reform and academic excellence (as it was under Secretaries William Bennett and Lamar Alexander). But for most of its 18 years as a Cabinet department, it has been simply a handmaiden of special interests. Not surprisingly, the Department of Education is a department for producers (educators), not customers (parents and children). The problem is organic and institutional, and is not simply a function of lackluster political appointments.

<p>
<b>The National Interest in Education</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To be sure, there is a national interest in education: a compelling national interest in high quality education for all Americans, of all backgrounds and from all regions. But that interest is best served by a vigorous federal system, not by centralization. The states are and should be "laboratories of democracy"; to force them into the same mold does violence both to America's constitutional traditions and to the very nature of education. It misconceives both. If, for example, there were one best system by which to educate everyone, a uniform federal role might have some basis in logic if not in practice. The French (who invented modern bureaucracy) and the Japanese are among those who make such a claim; but among Americans, a uniform federal role, except in a carefully delineated fashion, has always been understood to be bad policy and worse practice. A robust federal system offers unparalleled opportunities to reform and improve education, state by state, community by community. As each state learns more about reform within its own borders, other states are free to learn from its reforms and avoid the pitfalls of the less successful. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The argument for state and local control of education begins with the Constitution and ends with common sense. The Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reserves to the states all powers not specifically delegated to the national government, and education is quintessentially a state and local matter. From the time of the ancient Greeks to the present, education has been understood as a transaction between student and teacher. Everything else -- school districts, school boards, state rules and regulations, the federal role -- should be supportive, designed to assist teacher and student. Yet, as any candid observer must admit, a public school system, like any bureaucracy, tends to become insular and self-serving. The fault is not in teachers, but in the structure within which they must function. Unfortunately, the federal role reinforces this unhappy tendency.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The further control is removed from the classroom, the greater the danger that teachers will be frustrated and students (and their families) shortchanged. Of all social activities (such as health care, criminal justice, housing, transportation, and economic policy), schooling is the least likely to profit from centralized control. Yet that has been precisely the goal of federal involvement. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, adding a federal dimension has not solved lower-level bureaucratic problems within the system -- it has made them worse. Not surprisingly, just as "command-control" economies have failed around the globe, command-control schools are failing. At issue is a deceptively simple administrative principle: decentralization. In the world of business, this means that those who are closest to the workplace should make as many decisions as possible. In the world of public administration, it means the same. Each unit of government should do what it does best -- and only that. Higher units of government should yield as much power as possible to lower units, and must be able to defend -- in terms of efficiency or justice -- whatever functions they retain.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Perhaps most important, the states have grown dramatically in their ability to deal with problems and seize opportunities. Not only have state legislatures become modernized, and state governors increasingly more sophisticated, but most states now have well-organized citizen watchdog groups and state and regional think tanks that provide oversight and policy guidance.<sup>14</sup>
<P>

<b>The Lack of Need for Federal Intervention</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Had the Department of Education been created for compelling policy reasons, had serious problems been successfully addressed, had something "broken" been fixed, or had student performance climbed upward over the past decade and a half, perhaps some federal involvement in education could be defended. But only a weak political defense was advanced at the time, and no intellectually serious defense is being advanced now.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
No government agency should be allowed to continue indefinitely without having to justify itself to the people's representatives. Each one should be required to demonstrate that it is doing something worthwhile -- in other words, to convince Members of Congress that it is worth preserving. Members of Congress should ask themselves three basic questions: Would the U.S. Department of Education survive serious scrutiny if forced to justify itself?  Has it improved American education significantly?  If Congress were starting from scratch, would it create the same bureaucracy that exists today?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal role in education emerged in waves, in response to crises perceived or real. In the modern era -- after the GI Bill, a program to support and reward veterans of World War II -- there were five major waves: first, under President Dwight Eisenhower with aid to higher education, a military/economic response to Sputnik; second, under President Lyndon Johnson with the Great Society; third, under President Richard Nixon with limited federal support for research and development; fourth, under President Gerald Ford with P.L. 94-142, a bill to aid handicapped children that created radical federal intrusions into the classroom by making education a federal civil right; and fifth, under President Jimmy Carter with the decision to upgrade the Office of Education within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) to a separate Cabinet-level department.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Other programs have been added, but with the notable exception of special education, the broad contours of federal education policy were established under the Great Society. The announced reason for this was equity -- racial and economic justice. A long history of state indifference -- and even outright hostility--to the rights of black Americans finally mobilized a powerful constituency for federal intervention in education. Even though education is clearly a state and local function, both in terms of practice and in terms of policy, and as important as local control is, racial justice formed a higher claim, one that must be honored. But just as tough cases make bad law, moral fervor is no guarantee of balanced and effective legislation. As Finn notes,
<p><blockquote>
	There were genuine quantity-and-access problems at the time, and it was legitimate to enlist the national government in their solution. But the world has changed in the three decades since these programs were born and these assumptions fixed in policy. The essential nature of the education problem facing the United States is altogether different today.<sup>15</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Preempting the States.</b> Put bluntly, the task for the Carter Administration and liberals in Congress was to circumvent the Tenth Amendment, which specifically reserves to the states all powers not specifically delegated to the national government. Education is such a power.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The effect of this limitation is quite dramatic. Any federal role in education, insofar as it exists at all, is conditioned on one of two things: either some larger federal role, such as civil rights, or money. In the case of civil rights, the states must bend to federal law. But in all other areas -- curriculum, organization of instruction, homework, discipline policies, testing and measurement, or the hiring and firing of teachers, for example -- the amendment implies that the federal government can do no more than offer states and localities money and specify the terms. In other words, no compliance, no money; states and localities are free to refuse the funds, and Washington is free to withhold them. That is the theory. The reality, however, is that few states or localities refuse federal funds; the temptation of the "money power" has proven to be nearly irresistible.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Embedded in this broader debate is the "Mississippi problem."  Historically, the federal government treated all states equally; a rule for one was a rule for all. At one level, this is a sensible policy response in a federal system -- the equal treatment of equals. But the federal role in education was not motivated by such considerations; it was motivated by the conviction that there were vast disparities among the states that must be remedied. In this context, treating all states equally caused important problems. By default if not design, Mississippi became the benchmark. At the time of the Great Society, Mississippi was the poorest, lowest spending, lowest achieving, most racially segregated state in the nation. As the largest of the federal government's initial forays into education, Mississippi set the bureaucratic pace for everyone else: the lowest common denominator policy. Management by exception was never entertained; there would be one bureaucracy for all. And so it has remained.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
No matter that some states were more sophisticated and enlightened than official Washington, or that Washington bureaucrats had no claim to superior knowledge or virtue; each state would march to the same drummer. The appeal of "free" money proved to be nearly irresistible. State after state accepted official Washington's largess, and few if any appealed to their congressional delegations to change the rules. It was one-way federalism.
<P>

<b>RESTORING THE PROPER FEDERAL ROLE IN EDUCATION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The one irresistible impulse of any bureaucracy is to assume power -- indeed, to usurp power -- to serve its own internal dynamic. Put slightly differently, bureaucracy is designed to institutionalize the suspension of judgment, and bureaucracies do precisely what they are designed to do. They are "one-size-fits-all" institutions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Given the predilections of bureaucracy and the fragility of the education process, what is the compelling reason for a federal Department of Education?  Is Washington more virtuous, more competent, more equitable, more knowledgeable, more capable, more caring, more decisive, or more clever than states and localities?  Make no mistake: That is the issue. Only something of this magnitude justifies federal involvement in education.<sup>18</sup>  By way of illustration, it is clear that there is an overriding federal responsibility to guarantee the constitutional rights of all Americans, in school and out. The same is true of national data collection; Washington is better equipped to collect and display the data than any state or locality -- indeed, than all states and localities. In this case, of course, official Washington is the proxy for all states and localities. At the other end of the scale, however, is the management of classroom instruction, curriculum, and textbook adoption. In the best of circumstances, official Washington is capable of little more than offering advice. To control classroom management in Washington does violence to everything that we know about education; its only justification must be political, not pedagogical. And a political justification is, on its face, indefensible.
<P>

<b>Legislative Initiatives</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Members of the House desiring to eliminate the department generally fall into two camps: those who believe it should be eliminated entirely and those who think it should be merged with the Department of Labor and the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission. The only bill currently under consideration is one that would terminate the department, although there may yet be a merger bill. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.1883:">Back to Basics Education Reform Act</a> (H.R. 1883) sponsored by Representatives Joe Scarborough (R-FL) and Steve Chabot (R-OH), seeks to abolish the Department of Education within one year of enactment. The bill rolls all elementary and postsecondary education programs that are not terminated into two separate block grants to the states that are authorized for four years. These grants would be administered by a new Office of Educational Opportunities (OEO) within the Department of Health and Human Services, which also would run student aid programs, IDEA, and other programs not terminated or transferred elsewhere under the bill. The programs transferred to the new OEO would have their administrative accounts reduced by 30 percent, based on their FY 1995 appropriations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Abolishing the department and returning control of education to parents and to state and local governments would improve education and help to ensure that the federal government does not overregulate and interfere in an area that is fundamentally local in nature.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
H.R. 1883 eliminates major portions of the federal bureaucracy, including Titles I-VII and IX-XIV. A few of the larger programs remain intact. Impact Aid, a program designed to aid local school districts educating children living on military installations, is transferred to the Department of Defense. Indian Education programs are transferred to the Department of the Interior.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
H.R. 1883 is an excellent vehicle with which to accomplish this precisely because it recognizes explicitly that the "principles of federalism embodied in the Constitution of the United States entrust authority over issues of educational policy to the States and the people and a Federal Department of Education is inconsistent with such principles (Sec. 2.1)."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Representative Steve Gunderson (R-WI) belongs to the merger camp but has yet to draft any legislation. Under his proposal, which currently exists only in outline form, the department would be merged with the Department of Labor and the EEOC, with the intent that a more relevant and efficient delivery system be established in order to ensure that America's children have the necessary knowledge and skills to prepare them for the workplace of the 21st century.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This proposal is driven primarily by the need to streamline and save, with the stated end goal being to "prepare our youth for the challenges of the 21st century."  As Representative Gunderson stated in a press release earlier this year, 
<p><blockquote>
	By simply consolidating programs and eliminating duplication, we can stem the immense bureaucratic growth of these agencies and realize some savings in the process.... [I]t is not the function of this proposal to debate the merits of each program. Rather, through broad consolidation and coordination of programs, we can make dramatic cost savings and achieve a better federal education and employment system at the same time.
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unlike the Scarborough bill, which uses an underlying philosophy of the proper role of the federal government in education to determine what programs will be retained and where they will be lodged, Gunderson's focuses on streamlining the delivery of existing services rather than on whether the federal government ought to be involved in them at all. Having the Department of Education emphasize "work force preparation and policy" begs the question. Parents educate their children not only for the work force, but also for life. Even if education is tantamount to "work force preparation," that does not compel a federal role in bringing about that objective.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Official Washington's role should be limited to doing those things states and localities cannot do for themselves and that also serve a larger national purpose. The list is short and does not require a Cabinet-level department to implement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Getting it right.</b> Congress should dismantle federal agencies that do not serve the public interest, and the Department of Education is the most visible example. Conceptually, as Bennett, Alexander, and Finn all have noted:
<P><blockquote>
	The federal government should recognize that education in America is "the constitutional responsibility of the states, the social responsibility of communities, and the moral responsibility of families";<sup>20</sup>
<p>
	"Except when the civil rights of individuals are menaced, the federal government should <i>never</i> impede the capacity of families, communities and states to decide how best to provide education to their children";<sup>21</sup>
<p>
	The bully pulpit is appropriate, but goals and standards must always be truly voluntary; federal funds should not be used as "carrots" or "sticks" in ways that effectively diminish state and local control; and
<P>
	The federal government should "dedicate itself to (a) fostering family responsibility and local control, (b) assisting states to fulfill their responsibilities as they see fit, (c) providing sound statistics, prompt and accurate assessment results and other information, and (d) safeguarding individuals from illegal discrimination."<sup>22</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Doing it right.</b> To send responsibility home where it belongs, to transfer legitimate federal functions to other federal agencies, and to eliminate what is unnecessary is the job for Congress. For example:
<p><ul>
<li> The protection of the civil rights of all Americans should be enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice, as they are enforced in the larger society; a separate Office of Civil Rights in an Education Department is not necessary.
<p>
<li> Data collection, dissemination, analysis, and research should be transferred to a central Office of Data Collection in the Bureau of the Census.
<p>
<li> Aid to poor children in elementary and secondary schools (Title I/Chapter 1) should be made available to them as a transfer payment on their behalf, or as an education voucher. This should be negotiable in any school that satisfies a state's compulsory attendance statutes, without reference to whether the school is public or private, secular or denominational (as is the case in all other industrialized democracies). The administrative responsibility should be transferred to the states as part of an elementary and secondary education block grant administered by the Department of Health and Human Services.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
<li> College financial aid should be moved to the Department of Health and Human Services for the immediate future, and such aid should be merit as well as needs based (as it is in every other industrialized democracy). 
<p>
<li> All remaining funds should be made available as two block grants to the states, that would be gradually phased out. One block grant should be for elementary and secondary education programs and the other for higher education.
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
America's taxpayers no longer believe in major federal solutions to problems that are quintessentially local in nature. Congress can undo the damage and restore education -- lower and higher -- to its rightful place. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Great Society and the cluster of programs that grew up around it describe the contours of the modern federal role in education. They are nothing if not large, ambitious, bureaucratic, and intrusive. While these programs were introduced for a variety of reasons, the most important was the simplest: the conviction that states and localities could neither get it right nor go it alone. Most Americans no longer believe this (if, indeed, they ever did). It is time to restore education to its rightful role and place; federal involvement has been tried and, by and large, found wanting. The principle that should guide us into the next century is simple: Devolve to states and localities the responsibility for education. That is the necessary first step. The results will be both profound and far-reaching: the restoration of federalism and the revitalization of the nation's schools.

<h3>APPENDIX </h3>
<p>
<b>DISMANTLING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When the Department of Education was created, a number of important programs affecting schools were not transferred from other agencies to its control; as a result, interagency coordination remained a problem. For example, Head Start was left in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now Health and Human Services), which also retained control over school lunch programs. The new Cabinet agency in fact consolidated some 25 percent of about 400 federal higher education activities and less than one-third of all educational expenditures then in the federal budget.<sup>24</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the department's limited scope, opponents who feared the growth of a federal presence in education turned out to be correct. At the beginning of the 1980s, the Department of Education had a budget over $14 billion, 7,000 employees, and as many assistant secretaries as its parent agency, HHS. Today, the department has more than doubled its budget (now over $31 billion) and has more than 240 categorical programs -- 100 more than in 1980. The range of its activities will be broadened even further if, as the Clinton Administration has proposed, it succeeds in establishing its own direct lending program. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Continued federal involvement in education is wasteful and inefficient, and involves responsibilities best left to the states and local communities. The following analysis describes each program, identifies its key problems, and presents a series of recommendations for reform.<sup>25</sup>  Reform consists of doing one of the following in each case: (1) sending the program back to the states and local communities through an elementary and secondary education or a higher education block grant; (2) transferring the program to another federal agency that can handle the issue more efficiently; or (3) terminating the program because it has outlived its usefulness or is better handled by some other agency.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
FY 1995 appropriation figures are given for most programs in order to give a sense of the size of each program and the amount of money that would be saved or transferred to block grants.

Enacted in 1994, the Goals 2000: Educate America Act provided funds to states, local districts, and schools to develop comprehensive education reform plans. Under the program, states applied to the federal government for funds to be used for academic standards, model curricula, staff training, and student assessments. Goals 2000 established three new federal boards: the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), the National Skills Board, and the National Education Goals Panel.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The year-old Goals 2000 legislation, President Clinton's most important education program, has been a failure. Instead of "revolutionizing, revitalizing and reforming" America's schools, as President Clinton promised, Goals 2000 actually has slowed the process of change.<sup>26</sup>  It has created suffocating new government bureaucracies, increased federal regulations, and boosted federal spending. Worse still, it threatens to undermine progress to improve American education performance by encouraging schools to ignore academic "outputs" -- the results -- and focus instead on obtaining federal dollars by showing Washington that more money is being spent on "inputs."  The program also threatens the relationship of students and their families to the education process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Goals 2000 has failed America's schools in two fundamentally important ways:
Building Bureaucracies. Under Goals 2000, three new government bureaucracies were created: the National Education Goals Panel, the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), and the National Skills Board. These bureaucracies continue the old, outdated traditions of education "command-and-control" organization that continues to keep control of schools in the hands of education "producers" rather than "consumers."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Federalizing Education.</b> While Goals 2000 pays lip service to local control, the legislation comes dangerously close to mandating a watered-down national curriculum designed in Washington. The federal government's preliminary foray into identifying national history standards met bitter criticism that the standards were diluted and politically correct. Indeed the proposed standards so clearly distorted American history that the Senate rebuffed them by a 99-1 vote on January 18, 1995.<sup>27</sup>  This episode indicates one of the inherent dangers in the Goals 2000 approach. If NESIC's members were appointed, it would have become a <i>de facto</i> national school board whose 19 members would approve or disapprove all state-developed plans to meet goals set by the Education Goals Panel. Continuing attempts to "federalize" state and local education discourages real innovation and inhibits the most important school reform initiative of the decade: the movement toward privatization and school choice.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Continued taxpayer funding for Goals 2000's state and national programs will only strengthen the federal government's power to control local reform efforts, hampering efforts at grass-roots reform. Goals 2000 funding should be terminated and the money sent back to the states in the elementary and secondary education block grant to foster real reform such as school choice, vouchers, and magnet and charter schools.<sup>28</sup>

<b>School-to-Work Program: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriations: $125 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The school-to-work program, funded by the Departments of Education and Labor, was designed to "continue development of comprehensive State and Local school-to-work opportunities systems."  Federal money is to be used as seed money to bring about a more comprehensive national program. The School-to-Work Opportunities Act mandates that this program sunset by the year 2001. In its FY 1997 budget request, the Clinton Administration is asking for $200 million (an increase of $75 million over FY 1995) to expand the number of states receiving full implementation grants to 43 and fund national research, technical assistance, and evolution activities. States use grants to establish partnerships representing education, industry, and labor, and to develop new assessments and accountability procedures for their school-to-work systems. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
School-to-work programs have existed in various forms for some time and are an important part of preparing our nation's youth to lead productive lives. Nevertheless, both the state and national programs should be terminated. The federal government is not implementing a new idea; it is seeking to provide national leadership in developing a "coherent strategy" to help students move into the workforce out of high school. In an era of budget constraints, it is not appropriate for the federal government to take on such a task. Seed money is not necessarily the answer to the problem of developing effective partnerships between businesses and schools, and state-level partnerships with businesses to set up apprenticeship programs to bring non-college-bound students into a technologically advanced work force do not need federal oversight or funding. It is in the interest of private industry to ensure that workers are properly trained and equipped. States should make the implementation of such programs a priority and aggressively seek funding to provide their youth with a work history that enables them to succeed in today's work force.<sup>29</sup>
<p>
<b>II. Education for the Disadvantaged
<P>
Title I: Block Grant and Transfer<br>
1995 Appropriation: $7.2 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Title I (formerly Chapter 1) funding for local education agencies and schools in areas with high rates of poverty provides additional educational assistance to five million low-achieving students. More than $90 billion has been spent on compensatory education since the program was created in 1965. Despite this huge investment, there is no evidence of any positive effect.<sup>30</sup>  Mary Jean LeTendre, Director of Compensatory Education during the Bush Administration, admitted that if Chapter 1's performance were displayed on a heart monitor, "We'd either pull the plug or get out the clappers."<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pre- and post-tests administered to the same groups of students through a Department of Education study show that little progress has been made among Title I students. Comparisons of similar groups of children by grade and poverty show that program participation does not reduce the test score gap for disadvantaged students. Indeed, Chapter 1 student scores declined between the third and fourth grades in all poverty groups.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Chapter 1 instruction typically is offered for 30 minutes a day, five days a week. However, it contributes only about 10 additional minutes of academic instruction to each child's day. The benefit of additional time spent in Chapter 1 instruction too often is diminished by missed class time. During 1991-1992, 70 percent of elementary classroom teachers reported that students missed some academic subject during Chapter 1 reading/language arts instruction. Of this 70 percent, 56 percent indicated that students were missing regular reading/language arts activities during their Chapter 1 reading/language arts instruction.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another significant problem with Chapter 1 is an incentive structure that discourages reaching the very end for which the program was created. Since funds are allocated based on the number of educationally disadvantaged children in a district, as test scores rise so does the risk of losing program money. Having a large population of educationally disadvantaged children ensures funding.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The guiding principle for Title I reform should be reconnecting the program to its true beneficiaries: students, not schools. As it is, Title I commits more than $1,000 to each eligible child; if that money were available as a Title I voucher, it would permit children to select schools that best serve their needs, whether public, private non-sectarian, or private religious. Aid to poor children in elementary and secondary schools should be made available to poor youngsters as a transfer payment on their behalf, or as an education voucher. This should be negotiable in any school that satisfies a state's compulsory attendance statutes, without reference to whether the school is public or private, secular or denominational (as is the case in all other industrialized democracies). The administrative responsibility should be transferred to the states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As with AFDC and other forms of public assistance, Title I programs are best administered at the state level. Each state has different problems and concerns in educating its population and should be given the latitude to determine policy governing the distribution of funds to help the economically disadvantaged. Communities should be able to implement programs that respond to the needs of their children without being burdened with oversight from Washington. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following programs from the Office of  Elementary and Secondary Education's Education for the Disadvantaged should be terminated and the funds returned to the states through an elementary and secondary education block grant administered by the Department of Health and Human Services:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Capital Expenses for Private School Children. 1995 Appropriation: $41.4 million.</b><br> 
Provides assistance for local education agencies that provide "equitable services" for children enrolled in religious schools.
<p>
<li><b>Even Start. 1995 Appropriation: $102 million. </b><br>
Supports family-centered educational programs that involve parents and children.
<p>
<li><b>State Agency programs for Migrant, Neglected, and Delinquent Students. 
1995 Appropriation: $350 million. </b>
Provides services to children who have moved in the last three years and to incarcerated students. 
<p>
<li><b>State School Improvement. 1995 Appropriation: $27.5 million.</b> 
Designed to help states initiate school-based change, holding them accountable for improving the education of the disadvantaged. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following Education for the Disadvantaged programs should be terminated with no transfer of funds to the elementary and secondary education block grant: 
<p>
<li><b>Migrant High School Equivalency Program and College Assistance Migrant Program. 
1995 Appropriation: $10 million.</b> 
The High School Equivalency Program exists to help low-income migrant workers gain high school diplomas or equivalency certificates. The College Assistance Migrant Program provides stipends and tutoring to migrant students in their first year of college. These programs duplicate programs administered by Federal TRIO Student Support Services programs in the Office of Postsecondary Education, and at a much higher per student cost, and therefore should be terminated.
</ul><P>
<b>III. Impact Aid: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $27.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Impact Aid provides basic support to school districts affected by federal activities. The program was established during World War II to relieve the sudden financial pressure on school districts in which enrollment increased sharply because of an influx of relocated military personnel. Impact Aid Part A compensated school districts for educating children whose families lived on federal property. Impact Aid Part B was almost exclusively for children whose parents worked on federal property but did not live there. More than 2,400 school districts received Impact Aid funds. The Impact Aid program was reauthorized and altered in 1994, and the original categories of "A" children, "B" children, Section 3(d)(2)(B), Disaster Assistance, and Construction were replaced with other forms of assistance. Payments were continued on behalf of children living on Indian lands and children living on federal property who have parents in the armed forces. The 1994 reauthorization ended payments for the other categories of previously eligible children, including "B" children.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program has outlived its initial purpose and should be terminated. Impact Aid is based on the erroneous premise that military bases and other federal facilities are a cost borne by local communities. This is curious, since communities as a rule lobby heavily for such facilities and complain about the losses that will result if they are closed. In truth, these facilities confer substantial benefits through job creation and the infusion of what may be millions of federal dollars into the local economy. Since local governments evidently are convinced their economies gain from the presence of federal facilities, there seems to be no reason to provide them with Impact Aid as compensation for them.
<p>
<b>IV. School Improvement Programs: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1.3 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department of Education funds 18 small elementary and secondary programs, many of them designed to address certain perceived needs or as favors to Members of Congress. While many of these School Improvement programs have worthy goals, none can be shown to serve a purpose that cannot be achieved at the state level. All 18 programs should be terminated and a portion of the funds appropriated to the elementary and secondary education block grant proposed at the beginning of this section.
<p>

<b>Eisenhower Professional Development State Grants: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $251 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Eisenhower Professional Development Program provides grants to the states for professional development. This program replaces the Eisenhower Mathematics and Science State Grants, which provided inservice training in mathematics and science. The underlying philosophy of the program is that "Real reform and improvement in elementary and secondary education require a teaching force that is up-to-date in the content areas and skilled in imparting knowledge to diverse populations of students. Only intensive, ongoing professional development will ensure that educators have the knowledge and skills necessary to teach children the challenging State standards."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In its FY 1997 budget request, the Clinton Administration agrees that this program has had "minimal impact on classroom effectiveness," yet still wants to expand it to offer "professional development" in additional subjects. The Administration's request terminates funding for <i>Innovative Education Program Strategies</i> (Title VI) because, as explained the department's FY 1996 budget request, as a block grant it did little to contribute to real education reform since the money was spent primarily on such routine things as equipment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Administration assumes that the past failures of both of these programs can be attributed to their block grant status and the inability of states to bring about reform on their own without large-scale federal control and regulation. However, this is contradicted by current studies that attribute the programs' ineffectiveness to faulty assumptions about student performance. For example, in his exhaustive review of 113 studies that examined the relationship between teacher education levels and student performance, University of Rochester economist Eric Hanushek concluded that only eight showed a statistically significant correlation between teachers' advanced degrees and student performance.<sup>34</sup>  These programs should be terminated not only because professional development is not a federal area, but also because of the overwhelming evidence of their inherent ineffectiveness.
<p>

<b>Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $476 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under this program, the federal government gives grants to the states (1) to improve cooperation between schools and the broader community so that all available resources are brought to bear on drug and violence problems; (2) to fund a broader range of local activities, including before- and after-school "safe haven" programs; (3) to target more resources to communities with the greatest drug and violence problems; and (4) to increase accountability through a greater emphasis on collection and use of outcome data. The national programs fund federal development of model programs, evaluation of state and local safe and drug-free schools programs, cooperative activities with other federal agencies, direct grants to communities with severe drug and violence problems, and campus drug prevention grants to institutions of higher education.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is no evidence that this program has been effective in achieving its goals, as no comprehensive audit has been completed since the program was created. Such an audit would be difficult in any event because little is known about what method works best to prevent and reduce substance abuse. A recent study by the Research Triangle Institute, for example, showed that support groups and community service groups increased in number as federal funding reached the schools, but the results are unclear because it cannot be demonstrated that such groups are the best way to combat drugs and violence.<sup>35</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Money under this program is sent not to areas of specific need, but to 96 percent of the nation's school districts, with many the smaller districts receiving only a few hundred dollars. Moreover, districts that do receive large sums of money are not necessarily spending it wisely. A recent audit of the Fairfax County public schools in Virginia found that the county spent $176,000 of its Safe and Drug Free Schools grant to send hundreds of parents, administrators, teachers, and local business owners to a Maryland resort for meetings described as providing "the background for people to try and intelligently solve problems."<sup>36</sup>  In Montgomery County, Maryland, administering a $548,000 grant eats up more than $200,000.<sup>37</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While safe and drug-free schools are a laudable goal, this federal program does little to achieve that goal and duplicates similar efforts such as the Substance Abuse Block Grant, Title XX, the Preventive Health Block Grant, and programs under the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention. Like education, crime and drug programs are administered best at the local level by individuals who are close to the affected community. States and communities affected by violence and drugs in their schools already are addressing these problems. Federal funding means federal strings that make it more difficult for state and local officials to do their jobs.

<b>Inexpensive Book Distribution: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $10.3 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A nonprofit organization, RIF (Reading is Fundamental), has been contracted by the Department of Education to distribute free and inexpensive books to areas of particular need. The $10.3 million Inexpensive Book Distribution Program, although a worthy concept, could be funded easily at the state level or by private foundations.
<p>

<b>Education Infrastructure: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $35 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program was created under the 1995 Improving America's Schools Act to assist local education agencies in repairing and rebuilding school facilities. The department recommends terminating funding for the $35 million program due to the administrative complexity caused by the specific requirements LEAs must meet in order to receive assistance.
<p>

<b>Arts in Education: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $10.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program seeks to promote competency in the arts by encouraging the integration of art into elementary and secondary curricula. Congress should terminate the Arts in Education Program, which should be funded by private organizations or the states. Most of the money under this program goes to just two organizations: the Very Special Arts Organization and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Very little actually reaches the nation's classrooms.
<P>

<b>Instruction in Civics, Government and the Law: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $4.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This $4.5 million program makes competitive awards for programs that educate the public about the legal system and its underlying philosophical principles. Many of the grantees have been receiving funds since the early 1980s for the same projects and should be able to continue without federal assistance.
<p>
<b>Christa McAuliffe Fellowships: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Scholarships provided by this program fund teacher projects to improve education. Such support is best kept at the state or local level, where the need for recognition of teaching excellence and innovation is more immediate.

<p>
<b>Magnet Schools Assistance: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $111 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Magnet Schools Assistance program makes grants to local education agencies that are under some sort of desegregation plan, either court-ordered or federally approved. Preference is given to agencies proposing a new or significantly revised program and innovative educational programs. Congress should phase out Magnet Schools Assistance. Like charter schools, magnet schools already are well underway in many districts and are funded and controlled best by local and state authorities.
<p>

<b>Education for Homeless Children and Youth: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $28.8 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The objective of this program is to ensure that homeless children have equal access to education, and to run professional development programs to "heighten awareness of the special problems of homeless children and youth."  In essence, this program helps to advocate within state budgeting processes for the allocation of other funds for the homeless population. While this may be a worthy goal, it is hardly a federal responsibility. And because much of this money is used to lobby for additional funds, little is spent on the education of homeless children. Direct services for educating homeless children can be provided better through the elementary and secondary education block grant.
<p>

<b>Women's Educational Equity: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since 1974, this program has sought to promote educational equity through grants to local education agencies, nonprofit organizations, and individuals and through a national publishing center. This program is very small and funds only 32 grants of $100,000 each. The program has existed for 20 years but shows little evidence of success in achieving its objectives. If states find that gender equity is a problem that needs to be addressed, studies can be funded and administered at the state or local level; this is far better than a "one-size-fits-all" solution imposed from above. The federal government has no legitimate role in such subjective matters. 
<p>

<b>Training and Advisory Services: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $21.4 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Training and Advisory Service Program, which supports federal Desegregation Assistance Centers (DACS), should be terminated. Most "desegregation-related" activities in the states, such as busing, have been expensive failures.<sup>38</sup>  Public school desegregation has reached the point where the federal government no longer needs to be involved in such activities.
<P>

<b>Drop-Out Prevention Assistance: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $28 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program has funded local demonstrations of approaches to curtailing high school dropout rates. By law, funding was to end in 1994, but ESEA reauthorization provided for two more years of non-competitive funding of projects that had been supported in previous years. According to the department, the activity thus "evolved into a program of direct, noncompetitive assistance to incumbent grantees" and was no longer a demonstration program. The program no longer merits funding. 
<P>

<b>Ellender Fellowships (Close-Up Foundation): Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
According to an audit requested by Congress, significant increases in federal funding had no impact on the number of fellowships offered by the foundation; fellowships actually decreased as the federal contribution increased. Other organizations in the private sector run government education programs and are able to provide economic assistance to those who are in need. 
<P>

<b>Education for Native Hawaiians: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Native Hawaiians already are eligible to receive services from the Department of Education as long as they meet the criteria applied to all citizens. These programs duplicate those offered under Title I, as well as Special Education and other competitive grants offered by the Department. Since funding for such programs would be available to Hawaii through the elementary and secondary education block grant, separate funding is unnecessary. 
<p>

<b>Foreign Language Assistance: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $10.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Foreign Language Assistance program provides formula grants to local education agencies to encourage and improve instruction of foreign languages in areas where there is a perceived critical national interest. Currently, support is limited to instruction in Chinese, Japanese, and Russian. This program was targeted for termination in the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review because it is "poorly structured to be an appropriate vehicle for the advancement of foreign language education in the schools."  The formula grants to the states are too small to have a significant impact on foreign language instruction.
<p>
<b>Charter Schools: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $20 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Charter Schools Program provides funds to "support planning and initial implementation of charter schools created by teachers, parents, and other members of local communities."  While charter schools certainly are desirable, the states do not need this funding to create them. Congress should terminate the Charter Schools Program and turn the funds over to the elementary and secondary education block grant.

<P>
<b>Technical Assistance for Improving ESEA Programs: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $29.6 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Administration is proposing that funds be provided to complete the phasing in of 15 regional assistance centers to help states, local education agencies, schools, and other recipients of federal funds implement elementary and secondary education programs under ESEA. This is a consolidation of services previously supplied through 48 regional assistance centers. Since the programs these centers are supposed to help administer will be turned over to the states through block grants (Title I programs), terminated (bilingual education), or transferred (Indian education), these centers no longer will be necessary.
<p>
<b>V. Indian Education (IEA): Transfer   <br> 
1995 Appropriation: $82.8 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indian Education programs supplement the efforts of state and local education agencies and Indian tribes by providing additional funding to the Indian population. Local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to develop "comprehensive plans" for the education of Indian children apart from the plans they develop for other children. This program should sent to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, an agency far better equipped to deal effectively with the unique challenges facing the Native American population. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indian Education programs are similar to the Title I programs which serve all disadvantaged children. Special Programs for Indian Children include (1) a broad demonstration program for testing new approaches in such areas as early childhood education, dropout prevention, and public-private partnerships; (2) an educator professional development program to increase the number of qualified Indians involved in the education of Indians and to improve the skills of Indians already teaching; and (3) fellowships for Indians studying medicine, psychology, law, education, business administration, and natural resources. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Special Programs for Indian Adults help Indian adults acquire basic literacy, complete secondary school, and secure the education needed to enter advanced vocational programs. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Both of these programs duplicate many Indian education programs run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs within the Interior Department. Therefore, the entire Indian Education program, including all program funding, should be transferred to that agency.

<b>OFFICE OF BILINGUAL EDUCATION AND MINORITY LANGUAGE AFFAIRS
<P>
Bilingual and Immigrant Education: Phase Out Over Three Years<br>
1995 Appropriation: $206.7 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal government began funding local bilingual education programs in 1967. At that time, Congress made it clear that support should not be limited to any one instructional method; as the legislative report stated, the choice of method should be "left to the discretion and judgments of the local school districts to encourage both varied approaches to the problem and also special solutions for a particular problem of a given school."  This policy was reversed in 1974 when Congress effectively mandated that schools use "transitional bilingual education" (TBE) instructional methods, by which students are taught both in English and in their native language. In 1987, Congress loosened this restriction and allowed local governments to spend 25 percent of their bilingual education funds on "alternative" teaching methods, with 75 percent still required for TBE instruction. The federal programs assist local school districts in "building their capacity to operate high-quality instructional programs for recently-arrived immigrants and other Limited English Proficient (LEP) students."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Against the advice of local officials and many scholars, Washington continues to tie the hands of local school districts by requiring them to spend three-quarters of all their federal bilingual education funds on transitional bilingual education programs. Although federal funding is only about 3 percent of the total spent on bilingual education, the fact that the federal government favors transitional bilingual education over "alternative" teaching methods creates the impression that transitional education is the best way to teach recent immigrants and other Limited English Proficient students.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the federal preference for transitional bilingual education, numerous studies have shown that TBE programs are less effective than intensive English programs. A recent study by the Board of Education of the City of New York showed that 80 percent of students enrolled in special English programs were put in mainstream classes within 2-3 years, compared with only 51 percent of students in bilingual programs. Similar results were found in a READ Institute study of the schools in El Paso, Texas. Students in an English-based program in El Paso enter regular classrooms in 3 or 4 years, whereas bilingual students take 6 to 7 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department of Education itself has concluded that TBE programs, which involve heavy reliance on the pupil's native language, can delay English proficiency for as many as six years after instruction begins.<sup>39</sup>  This is disturbing, given that the primary purpose of these programs is to assist Limited English Proficient students to join the American mainstream as quickly as possible. Yet the bilingual education establishment continues to push TBE, which has proved to be both a source of jobs and a pipeline to the federal Treasury.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although there remains intense debate over which bilingual teaching methods are most effective, a consensus is emerging that local school districts are best able to tailor their programs to meet the needs of their foreign students most effectively. Notes Albert Shanker, President of the American Federation of Teachers: "The fact is that there is no proven method of bilingual education that guarantees English fluency. And I don't think that Uncle Sam, or anybody else ought to be shoving a particular message down anybody's throat."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As this $261 million program is phased out, local school districts should be permitted to use the money to develop the programs they deem most appropriate and effective in teaching English as a second language. This would restore the program to its original mandate of providing short-term federal funding to develop "special solutions" for Limited English Proficient students.<sup>40</sup>

The federal government has an interest both in ensuring that those who are disabled have access to quality education and in helping the states to achieve that goal. Therefore, the following programs would remain intact and be housed in HHS:
<ul><p>
<li> Special Education,

<b>OFFICE OF VOCATIONAL AND ADULT EDUCATION<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1.4 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Vocational Education program funds are used by states to support family literacy, vocational education, and job training, and to help adults complete a secondary education. Grants are allocated to the states according to a formula under which each state receives $250,000, with the remaining funds distributed in proportion to the number of persons age 16 years or older who have not completed a high school education. Basic grants integrate academic and vocational education and are allotted to states according to a formula based on state income, with an adjustment based on state per capita income. Currently, over $1.4 billion is spent on vocational and adult education. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 17 vocational and adult education programs duplicate 154 employment training programs administered by 14 different federal agencies. In an effort to ameliorate this situation, the Clinton Administration rescinded 1995 funding for the Community-Based Organizations and Consumer and Homemaking Education Programs. Under the Clinton Administration's FY 1997 budget proposal, programs administered by the Office of Vocational and Adult Education would be combined and broken down into two sets of programs: state grants and national programs. There would be separate state grant and national programs for vocational and adult education. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following programs would be consolidated under the Clinton-proposed state grants for vocational education:<p><ul>
<li> Tech-Prep Education ($108 million);
<li> Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Vocational Institutions ($2.9 million);
<li> State Councils ($8.8 million); and
<li> Permanent Appropriation (Smith-Hughes Act) ($7.1 million).
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
State Literacy Resource Centers, Workplace Literacy Partnerships, Literacy Training for Homeless Adults, and Literacy Programs for Prisoners are Adult Education programs that fund relatively few programs in only a handful of states. All these activities are best handled by state and local governments, which are closest to those who are being served. These programs would be merged into adult education state grants in the Clinton Administration's FY 1997 budget request. The Administration correctly argues that a single state grant "would permit states to establish their own program objectives based on their own unique needs, and would give states the flexibility to use federal funds for a range of activities... aimed at achieving those objectives." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The research, technical assistance, and data collecting functions for adult and vocational education would comprise the national programs under the Clinton budget request.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Combining these programs into state and national programs makes sense, but not at the same level of funding. Funding for vocational education and adult education should be cut by 50 percent. Vocational education funds should be combined with the elementary and secondary education block grant and adult education funds with the higher education block grant, described below in the section on the Office of Post Secondary Education. Sufficient funds should be appropriated for research, data systems, and grant management at the federal level. The national program should be housed in the Department of Health and Human Services.

<p>
<b>OFFICE OF POST SECONDARY EDUCATION<br>
1995 Appropriation: $13.4 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Programs currently administered by the Office of Post Secondary Education should be transferred to the Office of Education at the Department of Health and Human Services. Programs under Student Financial Assistance should be transferred to HHS, along with certain reforms, cuts, and terminations. Higher education categorical programs should be consolidated into a higher education block grant to be administered by HHS.
<p>
<b>I. Student Financial Assistance  <br>  
1995 Appropriation: $7.6 billion</b>
<p>
<b>Pell Grants: Transfer to HHS<br>
1995 Appropriation: $6.2 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Pell Grant program provides grant aid to low and middle-income undergraduate students. Unlike most other federal scholarship programs, it is the department's most "need-focused" student aid program. This proposal terminates most other merit-based scholarship programs in order to focus resources on need-based grant programs such as this one. Pell Grants should be sent to HHS along with other student financial assistance programs.
<p>
<b>Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants: Block Grant<br>
1995 Appropriation: $583 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The SEOG program, like the Pell Grant program, provides assistance to undergraduate students with financial need. Funds are allocated to institutions, however, based on statutory formula, and institutions match 25 percent. Students with exceptional need and Pell Grant recipients are given priority by the awarding institutions. This need-based program should be terminated and its funds included in the higher education block grant, enabling states to award money to institutions as they see fit.
<p>
<b>State Student Incentive Grants: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $63.4 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The SSIG program provides dollar-for-dollar matching funds as an incentive to the states to set up need-based postsecondary student grant assistance. Since 1972, all 50 states have set up their own undergraduate need-based programs. The original objective of this program therefore has been met, and federal funding is no longer necessary.  (Elimination of this program also was recommended by the Administration's own National Performance Review.)
<p>
<b>Federal Perkins Loans<br> 
1995 Appropriation: $176 million and
<p>
Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL)<br>
1995 Appropriation: $5.1 Billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Students receive federal student loans primarily through three programs: Federal Perkins Loans, Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL), and Federal Direct Loans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Approximately 2,700 participating institutions currently administer Perkins Loans. Borrowers are charged 5 percent interest during principal repayment and no interest during in-school, grace, and deferment periods. The annual maximum amounts a student can borrow under the program are $3,000 for undergraduates and $5,000 for graduate and professional students. The cumulative maximum is $30,000 for combined undergraduate and graduate or professional study. The federal government currently pays $18 million annually to cancel loan obligations of borrowers who go into "public service employment," such as law enforcement, nursing, or teaching in Head Start programs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the FFEL program, a student borrows money at a capped rate from private lending institutions. Banks making FFEL student loans have the loans insured by state and private nonprofit institutions, known as "guarantee agencies."  The federal government, however, reinsures these loans and is ultimately liable for up to 98 percent of defaulted loans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The FFEL program offers four types of loans:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
1) Stafford Loans are subsidized, low-interest loans based on financial need. The federal government pays the interest while the student is in school and during certain grace and deferment periods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
2) Unsubsidized Stafford Loans also are low-interest student loans. However, under this program, the federal government does not pay interest for the student during in-school, grace, and deferment periods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
3) PLUS Loans are available to parents of dependent undergraduate students. The maximum interest rate for PLUS loans is higher than for Stafford or Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, and the federal government does not pay interest for the student during in-school, grace, and deferment periods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
4) Consolidation Loans allow borrowers with multiple student loans who meet certain criteria to combine their obligations and extend their repayment schedules. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
All FFEL loans, except Consolidation Loans, have variable interest rates. The rate is capped at 8.25 percent for Stafford and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans and 9.00 percent for PLUS Loans. Today, these variable rates are tied to the 91-day Treasury bill rate; beginning July 1, 1998, rates will be tied to the government borrowing rate (currently the 10-year Treasury bill rate).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These loan programs should be removed from the jurisdiction of the Department of Education and operated by the Department of Health and Human Services. In addition, the following reforms should be instituted, both to reduce the cost of these programs and to cut defaults:  
<p>
<b>Reform #1: Eliminate the Perkins Loan Program.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Perkins Loan program is relatively small and exists largely to supplement the larger FFEL and Direct Loan programs. It easily could be eliminated or merged into these larger programs, reducing overhead and duplication. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Perkins Loan program also authorizes borrowers to have all or a portion of their loans canceled in exchange for service as a teacher, staff member in a Head Start program, volunteer in the Peace Corps or VISTA, law enforcement or corrections officer, nurse or medical technician, or family service agency employee. Yet there is no shortage of individuals interested in serving in these careers, some of which pay salaries and offer many rewards. There is no need to continue to forgive these loans for all individuals.
<p>
<b>Reform #2: Eliminate in-school interest subsidies.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Students should be required to accrue interest on loans while attending school, with no payment of this accrued interest until after they leave school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Federal student loans are virtually an entitlement for college- or trade school-bound students, with most funds aiding students from middle-income families. The Department of Education estimates that about 30 percent of all college students are receiving subsidized federal loans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Attempts over the past decade to scale back the eligibility for student loans have failed because of strong middle-class support for the program. But the program actually subsidizes members of the middle class with one hand while taking taxes from them with the other. Recipients of the loans, moreover, gain considerably at the expense of Americans who did not go to college. College graduates can expect average lifetime earnings about $600,000 higher than those of non-graduates, and many students who do not need loans borrow up to the hilt to obtain money for non-education purchases at below-market rates. The result: Those who do not graduate end up subsidizing those who do by giving them a passport to higher earnings. Taxpayer subsidies to college students at the very least should expire when they join the work force. Borrowers who have completed or quit college should pay lenders market interest rates on their student loans without further assistance from the government.
<p>
<b>Reform #3: Link loan eligibility to continuous academic achievement.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Student loan eligibility should depend on continuously satisfactory academic progress toward degree completion, with all students required to have a high school diploma before becoming eligible for a loan. Enforcement efforts should be increased to verify that students receiving federal assistance are still in school and working toward a degree, and objective standards, such as the student's retaining at least a C average for the entire academic program, should be introduced.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Taxpayers should not be financing the college education of students who are failing their courses. A publicly funded loan is an honor and privilege, not an entitlement, and students receiving federal loans must be given incentives to study hard and graduate. Students today can obtain loans even without graduating from high school, which merely adds to the probability of default. Moreover, they need only maintain a C average by the end of their second year of study.
<p>
<b>Reform #4: Include home equity in the determination of eligibility and modify the simplified needs test.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Higher Education Act of 1992 eliminated house and farm assets from consideration in determining a family's ability to pay for post-secondary education, thereby making it easier for many students to obtain Stafford loans. The Act specifies formulas by which to calculate a family's need for Stafford loans. The amount the family is expected to contribute is determined by what is essentially a progressive tax formula. In effect, need analysis "taxes" family incomes and assets above amounts assumed to be required for a basic standard of living. The definition of assets excludes house and farm equity for all families, and all assets for applicants with incomes below $50,000.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
House and farm equity should be included in the calculation of assets to determine a family's need for financial aid for post-secondary education. In addition, the threshold below which most families are not asked to report their assets should be lowered to its previous level of $15,000. Families whose houses appreciated during the 1980s are financially better off than they would have been if they had not owned a house then. Moreover, not counting this equity gives families who own a house an advantage over those who do not.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under current law, the needs test is used to determine which students enjoy subsidized interest. Revising the needs test would target subsidies more precisely to those who need them.
<p>
<b>Reform #5: Require lenders to share the risk of guaranteed student loan defaults.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This could be accomplished by reducing the standard federal re-insurance from 98 to 90 percent, except for loans designated lender-of-last-resort, which would continue to receive 100 percent insurance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For example, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), conducted by the Education Department's Planning and Evaluation Service,<sup>41</sup> found that:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Defaulters were four times more likely than non-defaulters to begin their postsecondary education without a high school diploma. Of this group of defaulters, approximately 40 percent had not received a general educational development (GED) certificate.
<p>
<li>Defaulters were more than twice as likely as non-defaulters to have dropped out of their postsecondary program.
<p>
<li>Defaulters were more than twice as likely to be unemployed or underemployed (earning less than $10,000) than non-defaulters at the time repayment was scheduled to begin.
<p>
<li>Defaulters had fewer and smaller loans, which indicates that they attended postsecondary institutions for shorter periods or went to relatively inexpensive institutions. This statistic may be explained in part by the fact that a significantly larger percentage of defaulters attended trade or vocational schools with programs lasting two years or less. On average, 72 percent of private vocational/trade school students receive federal aid as compared to 40 percent of students attending public undergraduate institutions.<sup>42</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If lenders were required to bear part of the costs of loan defaults, they would be more cautious in making loans for institutions with high student default rates. The federal government should cover only 80 percent on defaulted loans. This reform would give lending institutions an incentive to take greater care in scrutinizing institutions and collecting loans.
<p>
<b>Reform #6: Increase the default risk shouldered by loan guaranty agencies.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This could be accomplished by changing the current guaranteed loan program's guaranty agency reinsurance on defaulted loans from 98/88/78 percent, depending on the annual level of defaults, to 95/85/75 percent, except for loans designated lender-of-last-resort, which would continue to receive 100 percent reinsurance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 45 guaranty agencies, which include USA Funds, California Student Assistance Commission, and America Student Assistance, have been too quick to turn defaulted loans over to the Department of Education and the taxpayers. If guaranty agencies were required to bear part of the costs of loan defaults, they would be more diligent in their collection efforts before turning responsibility for a defaulted loan over to the federal government.
<p>

<b>Work-Study: Terminate</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Work-Study program provides grants to participating institutions to pay up to 75 percent of the salaries of needy undergraduate or graduate students working part-time, typically in on-campus jobs. The remaining 25 percent of student earnings is provided by the school or other employer. Funds are allocated to institutions according to a statutory formula, and individual grant amounts are determined at the discretion of institutional financial aid administrators. To the extent feasible, participating institutions are required to place Work-Study students in employment situations that complement their academic studies. They also are required by statute to use at least five percent of their Work-Study allocations to support students working in community service activities. The federal government currently spends $617 million annually on Work-Study.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In most cases, CWS students are employed by colleges -- for example, in food service, administrative offices, and libraries, or as teacher's aides. Thus, the federal government is subsidizing the employment expenditures of these institutions. Expecting taxpayers to defray the labor costs of well-endowed institutions like Harvard University, which receives over $2.9 million in federal work-study grants, reveals just how poorly conceived a program CWS really is. 
<P>

<b>Federal Direct Student Loan Account: Terminate</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Direct Student Loan program, recently renamed the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program, was authorized by Congress in 1992 as a "pilot" program. It was expanded by Congress in 1993, however, from a pilot program to a "transition" program. Now the Administration plans to replace the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, formerly known as the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) program, with the Direct Student Loan program. Under the Direct Loan program, unlike the FFEL program, the federal Treasury borrows money and then lends it directly to schools, which in turn lend it to the students. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The primary impetus for implementing it is cost: Replacing the current system with direct lending is supposed to lead to billions of dollars in savings. All current indications, however, are that it will not produce such savings.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Direct Lending centralizes control of post-secondary education lending in the Department of Education and creates the potential for huge, unconstrained overhead costs. Despite talk of reducing bureaucracy by switching to Direct Lending, the Department of Education is hiring over 500 new employees to administer these programs and anticipates hiring 20,000 contract employees when phase-in is completed. The federal government is funding the rapid expansion of this controversial program through an unencumbered $2.5 billion authorization.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not only does the Direct Student Loan program add to a growing bureaucracy, but it also adds to the national debt. Instead of allowing capital for student loans to be provided by private sources, the federal government now must borrow money to fund those loans. Several noted economists have warned that the Direct Lending program will add billions to the federal debt without saving a dollar. For example, Dr. Rudolph G. Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, cautioned federal lawmakers that they "may be on the verge of making a serious public policy mistake" when Congress was debating the program. Penner predicts in an economic analysis that direct lending may add $70 million to the federal debt by 1998, with financing costs that could erase any theoretical budget savings.<sup>44</sup>  Penner's concerns are supported by two other recently issued reports, one conducted by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) and another by economist Dr. Perry Quick of the accounting firm of Ernst & Young.<sup>45</sup>  All three studies conclude that any alleged savings associated with one direct lending program are highly unlikely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Estimates of the costs of the Direct Lending program change constantly. In 1993 when it was enacted, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the program could save $4.3 billion over five years.<sup>46</sup>  The most recent CBO report, however, takes into account the Credit Reform Act as amended by the 1996 Budget Resolution. The amended Credit Reform Act includes long-term administrative costs, and the CBO now projects that the program will save a mere $115 million over the next seven years. Eliminating the program entirely would save $1.5 billion in outlays over the next seven years.<sup>47</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition, government-run loan programs historically have had higher default rates than programs run by the private sector. A government-run monopoly like direct loans is unlikely to improve on the quality of service in the FFEL program. More important, the Direct Loan program is not subject to provisions terminating the eligibility of schools with high default rates -- which understandably are very enthusiastic about the prospect of direct loans.<sup>48</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because the Direct Lending Program fails to provide the savings it promises, it should be eliminated. Our student lending policies are not perfect, but nationalizing the program is not the answer.
<p>
<b>II. Higher Education Programs
<p>
Federal TRIO Programs<br>
1995 Appropriation: $463 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
TRIO programs provide a variety of outreach and support services to encourage low-income, potential first-generation college students to enter and complete college. These support programs target federal grant recipients and other disadvantaged students, working in tandem with federal grant programs focused on eliminating financial barriers to post-secondary education. Funds from this program should be included in the higher education block grant and sent back to the states in the same manner as Title I funds for elementary and secondary education.
<p>
<b>Aid for Institutional Development (Title III): Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $230 million</b>
]<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under Title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965, there are seven separate programs that support the operations and endowments of a few institutions of higher education. The Clinton Administration is requesting the same funding ($143 million) in FY 1997 for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions, along with a $40 million decrease in Aid for Institutional Development Part A (Strengthening Institutions) as part of a two-year phaseout. The Administration also proposes to eliminate the Endowment Challenge Grant general "endowments" program while preserving the HBCU set-aside portion of the program. The Administration argues that the federal government can support the general improvement of institutions more efficiently by increasing the investment in student aid; tuition revenues from a student receiving financial aid may be used for "developmental" purposes, as well as for endowment-building activities. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is unfair to the large majority of both public and private post-secondary institutions for the federal government to single out a few institutions for substantial amounts of federal aid. Many of the schools receiving this aid are financially secure and do not need special treatment. 
<p>
<b>III. Other Post-Secondary Education Programs</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to Aid for Institutional Development, the Department of Education funds over 29 small post-secondary programs that address a range of issues and activities. Most have achieved their original purposes, either largely or completely, or could be supported more efficiently by other funding sources. In its budget request for FY 1997, the Clinton Administration recognizes the need to eliminate many of these programs because they duplicate other programs, have achieved their purposes, or are supported more appropriately with non-federal funds. However, all of the following small post-secondary programs should be eliminated:
<p>

<b>Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education (FIPSE)<br>
1995 Appropriation: $17.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Funds from this program support projects with competitive grants that "enhance postsecondary education quality and cost effectiveness," according to the department. Current funding covers about 200 new and existing awards. The pursuit of education quality and cost-effectiveness should be the goal of all institutions of higher learning seeking to attract students; the federal government does not need to provide such an incentive. This program also supports exchange programs with European Community and NAFTA countries, activities that are available at the institutional level without federal funding. FIPSE should be terminated, with a portion of its funding transferred to the higher education block grant.
<P>
<b>Native Hawaiian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts Development<br>
1995 Appropriation: $500,000</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program provides support for the preservation of Native Hawaiian and Alaskan Native Art. Such funding is provided more appropriately by state and tribal governments. Moreover, funds are available for this purpose from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<P>
<b>Eisenhower Leadership Program<br>
1995 Appropriation: $4 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program provides grants to institutions of higher learning and nonprofit organizations to develop leadership skills in students. The department, following National Performance Review recommendations, is requesting no additional funds for this program in FY 1997. Activities promoted by these grants already are included in the curricula of post-secondary institutions' education programs. There is no need for federal involvement.
<p>
<b>Minority Teacher Recruitment <br>
1995 Appropriation: $2.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program administers two types of grants: partnership grants to institutions of higher learning to recruit and train minority teachers, and teacher placement grants to help state departments of education develop programs to help train minority students to become teachers. While minority teacher recruitment reflects a valid and current need, this program is too small to have an impact on a national scale. Only 13 small awards were given in 1995. Research should be done at the state level to determine what programs would best serve this interest, as there is little evidence thus far that giving money to these programs brings minority individuals into the profession who would not already have been there. 
<p>
<b>Minority Science Improvement <br>
1995 Appropriation: $5.8 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program grants money to institutions that primarily serve minority communities to encourage advanced study in science. Funds for advanced study are available through student financial assistance; money does not need to go directly to institutions for such purposes. This program should be terminated, with a portion of its funds transferred to the higher education block grant. States are better able to determine for themselves how best to encourage high-quality engineering and science studies at the institutional level.
<p>
<b>Innovative Projects for Community Service<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1.4 million </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program provides grants to nonprofit organizations and higher education institutions to encourage students to participate in community service. While this is a commendable goal, it is neither education-related nor a federal responsibility. In addition, it is too small to have an impact at the national level. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>International Education and Foreign Language Studies<br>
1995 Appropriation: $58.1 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
IEFLS funds graduate and undergraduate foreign language and area studies programs. This program should be terminated with a portion of funds put into the higher education block grant. States would be encouraged to use a portion of this grant to fund language activities.
<P>
<b>Institute for International Public Policy<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Funds from this program support the Institute for International Public Policy of the United Negro College Fund, designed to increase minority representation in the Foreign Service. This program is a direct grant to an institution performing a function outside the federal role in education.
<p>
<b>Cooperative Education<br>
1995 Appropriation: $6.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program funds the demonstration of cooperative education, but over 700 post-secondary institutions currently operate programs combining work experience with academic study without federal support. Federal support is no longer needed. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>Law School Clinical Experience<br>
1995 Appropriation: $14.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program was designed to provide clinical experience to law students that is best provided by non-federal sources such as law schools themselves. In addition, schools already have the incentive to provide clinical experience to attract students since its inclusion in the curriculum is so highly regarded. As recommended by the National Performance Review and the department's FY 1997 proposed budget, this program should be eliminated.
<p>
<b>Urban Community Service<br>
1995 Appropriation: $13.0 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program funds higher education institutions that serve as a resource for urban areas attempting to solve urban social and economic problems. These issues are addressed more appropriately by other federal agencies, however. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial Fine Arts Center<br>
1995 Appropriation: $4 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over $10.2 million in non-competitive federal construction grants has been provided to Bethune-Cookman College to construct this fine arts center. Any additional financing that might be required is available through private sources. This program is therefore unnecessary. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>Academic Facilities<br>
1995 Appropriation: $24.2 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program gives aid to institutions of higher learning for construction, reconstruction, or renovation of academic facilities. These institutions, however, should be responsible for funding their own projects. Providing such funds is not a federal responsibility, and this program should be phased out as soon as previously awarded grant and loan obligations are met. A portion of these funds should be sent back to the states in the higher education block grant.
<p>
<b>Historically Black College and University Capital Financing Program<br>
1995 Appropriation: $300,000</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The HBCU Capital Financing Program provides federal guarantees for private sector bond financing for the repair and construction of facilities at HBCUs. As with Aid for Institutional Development, providing such assistance to a select group of higher learning institutions is not a federal responsibility. Financing of this sort can and should be secured without federal assistance.
<p>
<b>National Early Intervention Scholarships and Partnerships<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3.1 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program was designed to "forge new Federal-State partnerships" aimed at encouraging disadvantaged youth to pursue higher education. The FY 1997 department budget proposes that this program be cut, since the current budget situation precludes adequate funding. While a worthy endeavor, reaching out to disadvantaged youth is best done at the local level. In addition, Pell Grants and other loan programs already encourage this.
<p>
<b>IV. Higher Education Scholarship Programs</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department of Education maintains several merit-based scholarships that do not focus on providing access to higher education for those who are economically disadvantaged. Most are small, categorical programs that are difficult to maintain and have high overhead costs. In addition, over $30 billion is already available to those who need money for higher education. Therefore, each of the following scholarship programs should be terminated:
<p><ul>
<li>National Science Scholarships ($4.4 million);
<li>National Academy of Science, Space and Technology ($2.0 million);
<li>Douglas Teacher Scholarships ($14.6 million);
<li>Olympic Scholarships ($1.0 million);
<li>Teacher Corps ($1.9 million);
<li>Women and Minority Participation in Graduate Education ($5.8 million);
<li>Harris Fellowships ($20.2 million);
<li>Javits Fellowships ($7.8 million);
<li>Byrd Honors Scholarships ($29.1 million);
<li>Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need ($27.3 million); and
<li>Faculty Development Fellowships ($3.7 million).
</ul><p>

<b>School, College, and University Partnerships<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program was created to forge partnerships to foster student readiness for the workforce. It is a relatively small program that duplicates functions of other federal and state-funded job training programs. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.

<p>
<b>Legal Training for the Disadvantaged (CLEO)<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program provides disadvantaged individuals with a basic understanding of our legal system. Non-federal sources now account for 40 percent of this program's total funding; the department believes this would continue even if federal funding was withdrawn, in addition to which aid would continue to be available through student financial assistance programs. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>V. Howard University: Phase out funding<br>
1995 Appropriation: $204.7 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Howard University is a federally chartered black college in Washington, D.C. Despite its federal charter, Howard is a private institution with over 13,500 students. The university's programs are tailored to enhance the opportunities of minorities in professional fields. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1995 Congress appropriated $206 million for Howard University -- over $15,000 per enrolled student. This appropriation was approximately $13 million above both the 1994 funding level and the Clinton Administration's request. Direct appropriations for Howard were first authorized in 1867. In 1988, Congress and the Department of Education directed Howard University to develop a plan for financial self-sufficiency; ten years later, that plan still has not been developed fully, and Howard remains one of the most highly subsidized private universities in the nation. Academic subsidies cover roughly two-thirds of the cost of educating Howard's students, enabling the school to charge less than the average for state-supported public institutions. These students receive still more subsidies through federal student aid programs. Moreover, 20 percent of its student population is made up of foreign students who enjoy a federal subsidy equal to that of their American counterparts, yet come from families who generally have not paid taxes to finance the school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to raising tuition for foreign students, another way for Howard to move toward fiscal independence would be to build up its endowment. The Howard University endowment has increased annually, due both to federal contributions and to private contributions from friends and alumni. The university should increase its efforts to solicit contributions from alumni and friends, as other institutions do. A five-year phaseout would give Howard the time and the incentive to build up its resources and endowment, as it promised Congress it would do ten years ago. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following reforms and phaseouts should take place over the next five years:
<p>
Phase out subsidies for:
<p><ul>
<li>Academic Programs (1995 Appropriation: $158 million);
<li>Endowment Program (1995 Appropriation: $3.5 million); and
<li>Research (1995 Appropriation: $4.6 million).
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Require Howard University to raise tuition for foreign students by at least 50 percent to offset the current federal subsidy toward their education.
<p>

<b>OFFICE OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND IMPROVEMENT<br>
1995 Appropriation: $324 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) is tasked with providing national leadership in the areas of educational research and statistics. Its stated mission is to promote excellence and equity in American education by:
<p><ul>
<li>  Conducting research and demonstration projects funded through grants to help improve education;

<li> Collecting statistics on the status and progress of schools and education throughout the nation; and

<li> Distributing information and providing technical assistance to those working to improve education. 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, OERI has grown into a bloated bureaucracy with many programs that easily could be turned over to the private sector or eliminated altogether.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
OERI was re-authorized under the Educational Research, Development, Dissemination, and Improvement Act of 1994. The Clinton Administration's 1997 funding request would support the research and development programs of five new National Research Institutes, the National Education Dissemination System, the statistics and assessments activities of the National Center for Education Statistics, and the creation of a National Library of Education. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 1994 Act authorized the Assistant Secretary for OERI to support activities to increase the participation of minority researchers and institutions. The law authorized funds for the operation of regional educational laboratories to provide technical assistance, promote education reform, and assist rural education. OERI also operates more than 15 categorical programs with budgets ranging from $800,000 to $83.2 million. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
OERI's budget should be cut in half, and the agency's statistical, research, and assessment functions should be consolidated in the Census Bureau. Library and technology programs should be cut and sent back to the states as part of the elementary/secondary education and higher education block grants. 
<p>
<b>I. Statistics, Research, and Assessment<br>
1995 Appropriation: $32.8 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The statistical functions of OERI, which build knowledge about education, should continue to collect data on education reform and progress. But the Census Bureau performs similar functions in a far less politically charged environment. OERI's essential functions have become increasingly partisan and bureaucratic in recent years. In 1994, H.R. 6 (the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994) alone created several new bureaucracies which operate under OERI, including five new National Research Institutes, a new National Education Dissemination System, and a new National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board. While the federal government should collect and disseminate information, it should not be in the business of setting reform priorities for state and local education agencies. The research, statistics, and assessment functions therefore should be consolidated in the Bureau of the Census.
<p>
<b>II. Improvement Programs</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Many of the small programs operating within OERI were recommended for elimination by the Clinton Administration in its National Performance Review. These functions either can be performed by the private sector, are new programs that are unnecessary or redundant, have outlived their original goals and purposes, or were created to benefit a special interest group. In addition, these small programs either do not need separate funding or receive substantial funding from non-federal sources. They should be eliminated.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration has recommended eliminating the following small programs in its FY 1997 request: 
<p><ul>
<li> 21st Century Community Learning Centers ($750,000), coordinated services projects that provide elementary and secondary school students and their families better access to social, health, and education services.

<li> National Writing Project ($3.2 million), a grant to the National Writing Project, a nonprofit educational organization that offers training programs in the effective teaching of writing. This program has received federal funds for many years and has been amply demonstrated as a strategy for improving the teaching of writing

<li> National Diffusion Network ($11.7 million), a general school improvement program that disseminates activities about programs that work well. 
</ul><p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Several other programs not recommended for termination in the department's budget request, including the Star Schools Program ($25 million) and International Education Exchange ($3 million), can and should be handed over to the states or the private sector. For example, the Star Schools program was enacted in October 1988 to equip small primary and secondary schools in remote areas across the country with classroom instructions via live satellite transmissions. This service is being provided by state institutions and by commercial industry. Private industry also provides help, through donations of computers and laboratory equipment as well as cash assistance, to the very types of disadvantaged schools that the Star Schools program is designed to help. Exxon Corporation, IBM, and General Electric alone have spent millions of dollars on pre-college education to improve student training in computers, mathematics, and the sciences. These private initiatives are far more promising than a federal program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Ready to Learn Television grant ($7 million) goes to Public Broadcasting specifically for the Children's Television Network, the makers of Sesame Street. This program existed without federal funding until 1995.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Fund for the Improvement of Education ($37 million) supports school recognition activities and various research projects. The information gained from research projects funded by this program is intended to benefit all states and aid the cause of reform. School recognition is best administered at the state or local level. With the elementary and secondary education block grant, a state can institute its own recognition activities. The research dissemination activities of this program will be handled by the research, statistics, and assessment offices sent to the Census Bureau.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These remaining programs can be cut because their purposes can be accomplished perfectly well within research and assessment programs: 
<P><ul>
<li>Eisenhower Regional Mathematics and Science Education Consortia ($15 million), which supports grants to operate regional organizations that put together math and science instructional materials and train teachers and administrators in teaching methods and assessment;

<li>Eisenhower Professional Development National Activities ($21.4 million), which funds national activities for teacher skill development in core subject areas; and

<li> Javits Gifted and Talented Education program ($9.5 million), which funds demonstration activities intended to improve the ability of elementary and secondary schools to meet the educational needs of the gifted.
</ul><p>
<b>III. Libraries</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The administration's FY 1997 budget request eliminates all categorical library programs and proposes instead that legislation be enacted to authorize a program of public library assistance state grants. Public libraries, however, should be free of federal involvement and funded at the local level or privately. These programs therefore should be eliminated:
<p><ul>
<li>Public Library Services ($83.2 million);
<li>Public Library Construction ($17.4 million);
<li>Interlibrary cooperation ($18 million);
<li>Library literacy programs ($8 million);
<li>Library Education and Training ($4.9 million), which can be financed through student financial aid; and
<li>Library Research and Demonstrations ($6.5 million). Other funds are available to fund demonstrations and disseminate findings through the Research division of OERI transferred to Census.
</ul><P>
<b>IV. Educational Technology</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department has requested $357 million for educational technology for FY 1997. This is part of a new initiative designed to "leverage substantial new investments in computer equipment, the development of educational software, and the training of teachers in the use of educational technology."  States have demonstrated, however, that they do not need federal involvement to give their students "technology rich" learning environments. Companies such as Microsoft and Apple have forged state partnerships to accomplish this. The money should be given to the states through the elementary and secondary education block grant.

<p>
<b>DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT</b>
<p>
<b>Eliminate all funding for Departmental Management while abolishing the Department of Education.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over $865 million of the Department of Education's $31 billion FY 1995 budget was dedicated to Discretionary Salaries and Expenses ($520 million) and permanent costs ($345 million). Permanent costs include Direct Loan Servicing and Other Costs, Guaranty Agencies and Other Transition Costs, and Federal Payroll Costs: Direct Loans and Transition. The $520 million authorized for salaries and expenses pays the costs of the staff, overhead, contracts, and other activities needed to monitor and administer the over 240 programs operating within the department, including the Office of the Inspector General and the Office for Civil Rights. The Clinton Administration has requested about the same level of funding for FY 1997, $506 million in discretionary authority and $355 in permanent budget authority. The increase in mandatory budget authority is due mainly to the costs of administering the Direct Student Loan program. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
With the abolition of the Department of Education, HHS will take over administration costs of programs housed in that agency.

<p>
<b>Office for Civil Rights</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The primary staff functions of this office are to investigate discrimination complaints, conduct compliance reviews, monitor corrective action plans, and provide technical assistance. It mainly handles disability and equity issues. The functions of this office should be moved to the Department of Justice, which already handles many education-related issues. Civil rights enforcement is more efficient and effective when consolidated in one central office, separate from the potentially conflicting agendas of separate agencies.
