<p>CHAPTER FIVE </p>
<p><font size=5><strong>Goals and Objectives for Preservation</strong></font> </p>
<hr>
<p>A plan is useful only if it is put into action. A vision of a better future is only a dream unless it is accompanied by ongoing 
commitment, strategic focus, and hard work to turn the vision into reality. Therefore the heart of The Preservation Plan for 
Georgia's Heritage is this set of goals and objectives that are designed to guide the Historic Preservation Division in doing its 
part to bring the collective vision for preservation into reality. Many other preservation partners must plan their own set of 
actions in order for the goals for preservation to be fully realized. Some suggestions for these actions are contained in Chapter 
6, A Call to Action. The objectives and planned actions in this chapter are those of the Historic Preservation Division. </p>
<p>GOAL 1: Achieve widespread public awareness and involvement in historic preservation in Georgia. </p>
<p>Annual Objectives </p>
<p>1.1 Increase awareness of DNR management, staff and boards of the value and means of preserving historic and 
archeological resources on state lands and water bottoms, with particular emphasis on the proposed Coastal Zone 
Management program. </p>
<p>1.2 Simplify survey, National Register, tax incentive, grant, and other forms and facilitate their use wherever possible. </p>
<p>1.3 Annually seek input from groups not traditionally involved in preservation - including American Indian, African-American, 
and physically challenged populations - in the development of priorities, funding, criteria, and historic resource programs of 
HPD. </p>
<p>1.4 Annually, through press releases, workshops, state conferences, publications and project assistance, increase the 
understanding that historic preservation is a factor in sustainable development through reuse of existing infrastructure, 
redevelopment of downtowns and intown neighborhoods, recycling of buildings, and reduction of landfills by reducing 
demolition. </p>

<p>CHAPTER SIX </p>
<p><font size=5><strong>A Call for Action </strong></font></p>
<hr>
<p>The preservation of Georgia's historic resources cannot be accomplished by the Historic Preservation Division alone. The 
Division's mission is to promote the preservation and use of Georgia's historic places for a better Georgia. This plan is 
designed to guide the Division in carrying out its mission. Other purposes of the statewide preservation plan include providing 
information about historic resources and preservation to a new audience, and identifying the role others in the preservation 
network play in bringing the preservation vision into reality. Historic preservation organizations, state and community leaders, 
property owners, and preservation volunteers and supporters must develop their own plans for the future. However, these 
plans can be most effective if they are coordinated. The vision and goals in this plan are representative of the views of 
preservationists across Georgia. The vision and goals can become a point of consensus among organizations with different 
missions but similar interests. </p>
<p>This chapter does not attempt to tell others what to do; rather, it points out actions that others can take to address the 
important preservation issues in Georgia's future. </p>
<p>National Action Needed </p>
<p>Goal 1: Achieve widespread public awareness and involvement in historic preservation in Georgia. </p>
<p>Federal agencies and national non-profit preservation organizations must continue to improve information dissemination and 
outreach activities, including use of mass media and new technology to broaden the awareness and support for preservation. </p>
<p>Goal 2: Gather information about all historic resources in Georgia, and make the information accessible for planning, advocacy 
and educational purposes. </p>
<p>Continue federal funding for surveys and National Register nominations. </p>
<p>Assist with the development of Geographic Information Systems and other technological advances to share historic resource 
data. </p>
<p>Continue to develop heritage education curricula using National Register information. </p>
<p>Goal 3: Secure financial and legal tools sufficient to preserve the significant historic resources in Georgia. </p>
<p>Continue appropriations from the Historic Preservation Fund that provide the basic framework for many preservation 
activities using a highly effective public-private and federal-state-local partnership to deliver preservation services. </p>
<p>Enact legislation that would provide financial incentives for the preservation of historic homes and other resources that now 
have few incentives. </p>
<p>Goal 4: Strengthen and expand the coordinated network of all historic preservation organizations throughout the state. </p>
<p>Delegate more preservation decisions to the state and local levels but retain federal agencies' ability to protect national 
preservation interests and to mediate between competing state, local, public and private interests. </p>
<p>Goal 5: Protect and use Georgia's historic places so that they may exist into the future. </p>
<p>Focus more on training, increasing public awareness, and providing the legal framework and financial support for protection, 
rather than on control of preservation decisions. </p>
<p>Find solutions to technical preservation problems such as lead-based paint or successful sustainable development techniques, 
and rapidly distribute the information nationwide. </p>
<p>State Level Action Needed </p>
<p>Goal 1: Achieve widespread public awareness and involvement in historic preservation in Georgia. </p>
<p>Work in partnership with the Historic Preservation Division to more effectively communicate the preservation message to a 
broader audience. </p>
<p>Encourage and actively seek the participation of groups that have not traditionally been members of preservation 
organizations. </p>
<p>Develop partnerships with other organizations with similar goals, such as environmental groups, planning organizations, tourism 
organizations, and local government organizations, to encourage them to become active in preservation. </p>
<p>Goal 2: Gather information about all historic resources in Georgia, and make the information accessible for planning, advocacy 
and educational purposes. </p>
<p>Work cooperatively with the Historic Preservation Division to develop a Geographic Information System for historic 
resources so that data can be shared among state and other agencies, and historic resources can be included in State agency 
planning. </p>
<p>Contribute to the database of historic properties by carrying out studies and developing historic contexts identified as priorities 
by the Historic Preservation Division. </p>
<p>Seek federal and state funding for archeological site evaluation and recording throughout the state. </p>
<p>Goal 3: Secure financial and legal tools sufficient to preserve the significant historic resources in Georgia. </p>
<p>Support efforts to increase the Georgia Heritage 2000 funding to meet existing needs for rehabilitation, surveys and planning, 
and special initiatives. </p>
<p>Participate in national efforts to retain federal preservation law, programs and funding. </p>
<p>Provide ideas and assist in the development of new state and federal legislation that would provide new protection or 
assistance to historic properties. </p>
<p>Goal 4: Strengthen and expand the coordinated network of all historic preservation organizations throughout the state. </p>
<p>Actively participate in the Historic Preservation Division's annual planning and public participation processs. </p>
<p>Establish better communication and coordination techniques with preservation and related organizations. </p>
<p>Assist local governments and organizations to become more effective in preserving historic places, by providing funding, 
training, technical assistance, legislative support, and encouragement. </p>
<p>Goal 5: Protect and use Georgia's historic places so that they may exist into the future. </p>
<p>Join in the expanding efforts to identify the costs of sprawl, the benefits of sustainable development, and the role historic 
preservation plays in defining community character. </p>
<p>Expand the use of easements, charitable donations of property, and other property-owner driven techniques of protecting 
historic places. </p>
<p>Participate in training local governments, preservation commissions, and preservation organizations in the use of preservation 
ordinances, planning, appropriate rehabilitation, and other methods of protecting historic properties at the local level. </p>
<p>Encourage the use of community development funds for rehabilitation of historic properties for affordable housing, community 
centers, and other needed projects. </p>
<p>Encourage State agencies to follow a stewardship policy of using historic buildings and incorporating the protection of historic 
properties into the management plans for State-owned property. </p>
<p>Local Level Action Needed </p>
<p>Goal 1: Achieve widespread public awareness and involvement in historic preservation in Georgia. </p>
<p>Increase efforts to broaden the public's knowledge and appreciation for historic preservation. </p>
<p>Get children involved in learning about and protecting their heritage. </p>
<p>Keep elected and appointed officials informed of preservation projects and activities in your community and make sure they 
know the benefits preservation brings to your community. </p>
<p>Include new groups in local preservation efforts; broaden the definition of who in the community is a preservationist. </p>
<p>Publicly recognize and thank individuals, organizations and businesses that assist preservation efforts. </p>
<p>Team up with other organizations with shared interests. </p>
<p>Use markers or signs to identify historic properties, and market historic places as a destination for tourists, businesses and 
residents. </p>
<p>Goal 2: Gather information about all historic resources in Georgia, and make the information accessible for planning, advocacy 
and educational purposes. </p>
<p>Find out what historic resources exist, and keep the information current. </p>
<p>Share all new historic re-source inventory data with the Historic Preservation Division and the Regional Development Center 
to insure its use in planning. </p>
<p>Actively advocate for improved regional and local planning and sustainable development. </p>
<p>Review the local comprehensive plan to determine if historic resources have been adequately addressed, and if preservation 
goals are integrated into land use, housing, transportation, community facilities, and economic development goals. Be involved 
in updating the plan, and track the progress made in implementing the plan. </p>
<p>Nominate eligible properties to the National Register of Historic Places. </p>
<p>Advocate the inclusion in surveys and in planning processes any special resource types, such as archeological sites, American 
Indian historic resources, Civil War battlefields, African-American resources, or resources from the recent past. </p>
<p>Goal 3: Secure financial and legal tools sufficient to preserve the significant historic resources in Georgia. </p>
<p>Consider accepting delegated authority from the Historic Preservation Division for certain preservation decisions and 
programs. </p>
<p>Learn more about and promote the use of easements as an effective way to protect historic resources while providing 
economic benefits to the property owner. </p>
<p>Consider designating conservation districts as a way to preserve community character. </p>
<p>Develop local financial incentives for preservation, such as facade grants, land trusts or revolving funds. </p>
<p>Actively support statewide and national efforts to maintain the national and state preservation programs and funding on which 
local preservation efforts depend. </p>
<p>Support efforts to adequately fund the Regional Historic Preservation Planning program to provide statewide coverage and 
full-time services. </p>
<p>Join preservation advocacy organizations. </p>
<p>Goal 4: Strengthen and expand the coordinated network of all historic preservation organizations throughout the state. </p>
<p>Attend the annual statewide historic preservation conference, and bring a new member of the network with you. </p>
<p>Join preservation advocacy organizations. </p>
<p>Actively take part in the Historic Preservation Division's annual public participation opportunities for inclusion in its planning 
process. </p>
<p>Incorporate preservation into the mission of other organizations with similar interests. </p>
<p>Goal 5: Protect and use Georgia's historic places so that they may exist into the future. </p>
<p>Pass a historic preservation ordinance, establish a preservation commission, and apply to become a Certified Local 
Government. </p>
<p>Insure that local preservation commissions receive regular training, to more effectively protect local historic resources. </p>
<p>Join the Georgia Alliance and the National Alliance of Preservation Commissions. </p>
<p>Use available funds such as CDBG, ISTEA, Local Development Fund grants, and others to rehabilitate historic properties to 
meet community needs. </p>
<p>Learn how Section 106 and the Georgia Environmental Policy Act can help protect local interests and historic resources, then 
get involved in these processes. </p>
<p>Disseminate information on good preservation practices for historic property protection, restoration and rehabilitation. </p>
<p>Conclusion </p>
<p>Decisions to preserve or not preserve historic places are made at all levels of government. Policies made at one level of 
government affect the actions of another level of government. Private organizations can do certain things that public agencies 
cannot. Public agencies can provide certain services and assistance and enforce laws and policies that the private sector 
cannot. Preservationists in all spheres of influence depend on the cooperation of others to accomplish their goals. The same is 
true in Georgia. By agreeing to work in concert with one another to achieve the vision and goals of the state historic 
preservation plan, the effect of our efforts will be multiplied. Historic places thereby will have a better chance of surviving into 
the future.</p>

<p>CHAPTER SEVEN </p>
<p><font size=5><strong>The Planning Process</strong></font></p>
<hr>
<p>An effective historic preservation plan must do many things. It must represent the considered views of those who will 
implement it and those who will be affected by its implementation. It must consolidate the myriad issues now confronting 
historic preservation and anticipate how those issues will play out in the future. The plan must be strategic by focusing on the 
highest priorities, effectively addressing threats and taking advantage of opportunities. It must be practical, yet present a vision 
and goals that push us beyond current practices and ways of thinking. Of equal importance to the preparation and publication 
of a planning document is the planning process from which the document was created, and the ongoing planning process that 
results in implementation of the plan. Implementation of a statewide plan would be impossible unless its goals were shared by 
many in the preservation constituency throughout the state. </p>
<p>This Plan was developed as a successor to A Vision for the Future: The Georgia Historic Preservation Plan, published in 
1989. Preparation and implementation of a statewide comprehensive plan for historic preservation is required by the National 
Park Service for a State Historic Preservation Office's continuation in the national historic preservation program. The Historic 
Preservation Division is also required to produce an &quot;action plan&quot; to implement the DNR Strategic Plan, which was adopted in 
late 1995. This plan fulfills both requirements. </p>
<p>Public Participation Phase I </p>
<p>The planning process began in earnest in November, 1994 when the Historic Preservation Division distributed a questionnaire 
to seek the comments, concerns and priorities of the general public and preservation constituencies. Although less than 100 
responses were received, the questionnaires that were returned represented a broad spectrum of organizations, areas of the 
state, professional disciplines, volunteer activities, and perspectives. The Division also made three presentations to the Georgia 
National Register Review Board at progressive stages in the process, to present findings and get feedback from the Division's 
advisory board. </p>
<p>In January and February of 1995, a series of six Planning Forums was held in Decatur, Dalton, Savannah, Fitzgerald, 
Columbus, and Washington. The Forums were widely advertised through the print media and personal invitations, and were 
attended by 411 people from many communities and organizations. The Forums were structured to provide information to the 
audience, then to elicit through discussion, written responses, and voting, specific views on historic resources, preservation 
programs, threats to resources, opportunities for preservation, services from the Historic Preservation Division, and goals for 
this Plan. The Forums were lively, well-attended, and productive. They brought into focus the widely varying viewpoints on 
preservation and historic places, and the widely varying needs for preservation services throughout Georgia. </p>
<p>Following the Planning Forums, a Preservation Roundtable session was held at the Statewide Historic Preservation 
Conference in February, to present the top preservation goals that emerged from the Forums, and to ask the participants to 
suggest high priority objectives to help reach each of the goals. </p>
<p>In-depth interviews were then conducted during the spring with a selected group of Georgia's preservation leaders, bringing 
the first phase of public input to a close. </p>
<p>Data Collection and Analysis </p>
<p>After public comments were analyzed, they were presented to the Historic Preservation Division staff at a planning retreat. 
The public comments, other findings from data analysis, special reports on preservation topics, and the study of local 
comprehensive plans formed the basis for staff input into the Division's mission statement and the Plan's goals and objectives. 
Data on historic resources, historic contexts, and distinctive aspects of Georgia history that were covered in depth in the first 
statewide historic preservation plan, A Vision for the Future, were reviewed and updated, but remain valid. This data formed 
the basis for the summary information on historic resources and for the historic resource based goals and objectives in this 
Plan. </p>
<p>Plan Development </p>
<p>The written plan was developed throughout the summer and fall of 1995, based on the public input, historic resource data, 
and trends analysis that had been completed earlier. Highlights from this analysis were shared with the Georgia National 
Register Review Board, Georgians for Preservation Action, and selected preservation leaders for reaction as the Plan 
developed. The Department of Natural Resources Strategic Plan, which was in development at the same time, helped shape 
the Georgia Historic Preservation Plan. </p>
<p>Public Participation Phase II </p>
<p>The draft Plan was reviewed by a panel of readers selected to represent a broad cross-section of opinions, regions, 
professional expertise, and areas of interest in preservation. Comments and feedback from these thirty-seven readers were 
used in revising the Plan. </p>
<p>Plan Implementation </p>
<p>The Georgia Historic Preservation Plan is designed to be put into practice, not sit on a shelf. Therefore an annual Action Plan 
will be developed by the Historic Preservation Division. The Action Plan will include specific actions that HPD will undertake 
in order to achieve the goals and objectives of the Plan. Accountability for the actions is insured by input from the public and 
the Georgia National Register Review Board and by assignment of each action to an HPD staff member. In addition, the 
Georgia Historic Preservation Plan and the annual Action Plan will be widely distributed to interest groups and the public to 
encourage them to work in partnership to achieve the goals and the vision for preservation in Georgia. HPD will seek public 
input each year as it evaluates the Historic Preservation Plan and prepares the Action Plan. </p>
<p>Revising the Plan </p>
<p>The Georgia Historic Preservation Plan is designed to guide HPD's historic preservation programs, policies, and services 
through the year 2000. The effectiveness of the Plan will be continuously monitored, and the annual Action Plan will allow for 
adjustments each year. The overall Plan will be thoroughly re-evaluated in the year 2000 to determine its validity for the future. </p>

<p>CHAPTER EIGHT </p>
<p><font size=5><strong>In Conclusion</strong></font> </p>
<hr>
<p>How shall we look ahead and shape Georgia's future? By first looking back. Grady Clay, radio commentator, veteran 
observer of cities and author of Real Places, says, &quot;figuring out how your place came to be is the first step to knowing what to 
do next....Keeping a running, truthful account of how places get shaped, shifted, thwarted, and aborted is one of the most 
important jobs in your city and mine.&quot; This is what historic preservation does. In faithfully preserving historic places we tell the 
true story of how our communities and state became the places they are today. Georgia's historic places provide our identity 
as Georgians. As the state continues to change at an ever-increasing pace, we need links with our past to provide a sense of 
self and of place. Preservation of historic resources provides economic benefits that cannot be duplicated by new 
development. Preservation encourages more sensible development patterns that make our communities more livable. Our 
vision for Georgia in the new century must include our historic resources. </p>
<p>The historic places that make Georgia special will not preserve themselves. If they are to survive in the face of rapid change, 
we must plan ahead and work together to ensure their survival. The task will not be easy, for preservation takes the long view 
in a society that looks for the quick fix. Preservation is a decision for quality of life, when most decisions are based only on the 
short-term bottom line. Preservation requires cooperation among many partners when the trend is toward separation and 
competition. But we must succeed. </p>
<p>What is the alternative? A Georgia where communities have disappeared into nameless, repetitive areas of endless sprawl, 
devoid of character. A Georgia whose major cities have lost their center to suburbanization. A Georgia whose children lose 
hope in the future because they have no sense of the accomplishments of their past. </p>
<p>Each community leader, preservation organization, historic property owner, preservation supporter, elected official, and 
Georgia citizen has a stake in the future of Georgia, and each of us has a vital role to play in preserving our heritage for the 
future. </p>
<p>The Historic Preservation Division will strive to fulfill its mission to promote the preservation and use of historic places for a 
better Georgia. The Division will do all it can to turn the new vision into reality. Whether this vision will one day come about 
will be determined by a thousand individual decisions. The choices we make and our commitment to the vision for 
preservation will decide Georgia's future. The future is now. Will we accept the challenge? </p>

<p>Historic Preservation Element of the Local Comprehensive Plan </p>
<p>The Georgia Planning Act of 1989 created the framework for
local comprehensive planning in Georgia. The Act requires
inclusion of a historic preservation element along with land use,
transportation, housing, economic development, recreation and
other elements. For preservation to be effective, it must be
fully incorporated into a community's planning and decision
making process. </p>
<p>The Department of Natural Resources' Historic Preservation
Division provides survey and planning asssistance to communities
throughout Georgia. HPD compiles historic property survey data
statewide and disseminates it through the Regional Development
Centers. Technical assistance and state and federal funding are
available to assist Georgia communities in surveying historic
properties. Approximately ten new community surveys are completed
each year. Limited federal funding is available for planning,
National Register evaluation and registration, local government
programs, archeological research and information/education
activities. HPD staff and RDC Historic Preservation Planners can
provide assistance with planning and any other preservation
activities. </p>
<p>Model Community Preservation Plan </p>
<p>I. Identification of Local Historic Properties </p>
<p>A. Preliminary area analysis B. Outline of local developmental
history C. Statement of unique or distinctive aspects of local
prehistory, history and historic properties D. Field survey of
historic properties (optional) </p>
<p>II. Evaluation of Current Trends and Influences on Historic
Preservation </p>
<p>A. Analysis of population, economic, land use, housing,
transportation, and other change in the community B. Analysis of
opportunities for preservation C. Analysis of threats to
preserving local historic properties </p>
<p>III. Community Consensus on Goals and Priorities for
Preservation of Historic Properties (Include: elected officials,
community leaders, preservation organizations, special interest
groups, historic neighborhoods, business leaders, major
institutions, and civic organizations) </p>
<p>IV. Identification of Tools, Strategies, and Actions Needed to
Achieve Community Goals </p>
<p>A. Public awareness B. Field survey of historic properties, if
needed C. Evaluation and designation D. Legal and regulatory
protection E. Financial incentives F. Community development,
downtown or neighborhood revitaliza- tion programs </p>
<p>V. Action Plan and Implementation </p>
<p>These five steps outline the process any community should
follow in developing a comprehensive historic preservation plan.
The process incorporates the three federal standards for
preservation planning. The Department of Natural Resources'
Historic Preservation Division provides survey and planning
assistance to communities throughout Georgia. Technical
assistance and limited funding are available for developing local
preservation plans, conducting surveys, National Register
evaluation and registration, developing protection strategies,
and information and education activities. </p>

</p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><br>
<font size="3">A new century looms before us. Already we begin
taking stock. What was the twentieth century<br>
about? What did we accomplish? What did it mean? How did we fail
and how did we triumph? <br>
Already we begin looking ahead. How will we shape the
twenty-first century? How will it shape<br>
us? Will it be more of the same, or will we make new and better
choices? We prepare to witness<br>
the end of an amazing era; yet we also anticipate the beginning
of something new. <br>
<br>
As we head toward 2000 and beyond, it is time to create a new
vision. A vision of community, of<br>
shared experiences and shared heritage. A vision of a sustainable
society rather than a throwaway<br>
one. A vision that blends what we treasure from our past
accomplishments and experiences with<br>
what we create from new ideas.<br>
<br>
Georgia ends the twentieth century as one of the fastest growing
and changing states in the union. <br>
We have grown so fast that we have not taken the opportunity to
stop and assess, to adjust our<br>
course, to decide if our choices have been best. Now is that
time. <br>
<br>
New plans are underway in Georgia for the future of our
communities, for new direction in state<br>
government, for new transportation systems, for the Atlanta
region to the year 2020, for coastal<br>
management, for economic development and for many other aspects
of Georgia. Planning for our<br>
future must include planning for the continuation and protection
of our heritage -- our historic<br>
places and cultural patterns that tell the story of who we have
been and who we are becoming.<br>
<br>
New Vision: The Preservation Plan for Georgia's Heritage is the
plan for the state historic<br>
preservation program administered by the Historic Preservation
Division of the Georgia<br>
Department of Natural Resources. It covers the final chapter of
the twentieth century, specifically<br>
the years 1996 through 2000. Yet it is more about the advent of
the new century than the end of<br>
the current one, for the future is now. The choices we make now
will limit the options and create<br>
the opportunities we will have when the new century arrives. <br>
<br>
This plan presents a new vision that is shared by many. It sets
goals that are designed to turn the<br>
vision into reality. It identifies actions that will help keep
open the options, remove the barriers,<br>
and create the opportunities that will allow Georgians to
preserve their historic places for a better<br>
future. The plan is intended to guide the direction and
activities of the Historic Preservation<br>
Division. Because it also represents the views and priorities of
preservationists throughout<br>
Georgia who participated in its development, New Vision: The
Preservation Plan for Georgia's<br>
Heritage can provide common direction for all organizations and
individuals who support the<br>
preservation of our historic places. <br>
<br>
How will Georgia grow and change in the new century? How will our
neighborhoods and our<br>
communities meet our needs and reflect our values? How will we
tell our story of who we are as<br>
Georgians? Historic preservation can provide some of the answers
to these vital questions. The<br>
Historic Preservation Division has adopted this plan as a
statement of policy direction and as a<br>
commitment to action for the protection and use of Georgia's
valuable historic resources. We<br>
invite the reader to join us in working together to turn the new
vision into reality for the<br>
betterment of Georgia. </font><font size="4"><br>

<em>Theme for 1997 Conference </em></p>
<p>The 1997 historic preservation conference, jointly sponsored
by the Historic Preservation Division and the Georgia Trust for
Historic Preservation will be held Sunday through Wednesday,
November 2 - 7, 1997, at the Classic Center in Athens. The state
conference will be held in conjunction with the southeastern
State Historic Preservation Offices annual meeting, which is
being held in Georgia for the first time since 1986. </p>
<p>The theme of the conference is A Celebration of Southern
Places. The keynote speaker will be Dr. Bill Ferris, director of
the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of
Mississippi in Oxford, and editor of The Southern Register, the
Center&#146;s quarterly newsletter, which celebrates the South
through a study of its history, culture, and arts.Dr.
Ferris&#146; keynote has been underwritten by the Athens-based
rock group R.E.M. Long-time supporters of preservation, R.E.M. is
the first sponsor of the 1997 conference. As in past years, HPD
and the Georgia Trust will be soliciting additional sponsorships
for <br>
underwriting conference expenses. </p>
<p>The goal of the 1997 conference will be to highlight the
unique qualities of southern heritage and resources, and to
celebrate the many people, places, and traditions that make up
the culture of the South. The conference program will also be a
vehicle for teaching, and will introduce ideas, concepts and
techniques in preservation practices that are on the cutting edge
of preservation activity. </p>
<p>If you are interested in a conference sponsorship, or if you
have program ideas, contact Carole Moore, conference coordinator,
at 404-651-5268. </p>

</font>Ken Thomas has been appointed to the Board of the Center
for the Study of Georgia History. </p>
<p>Pratt Cassity and Lisa Vogel of the Office of Preservation
Services have co-authored an article for Historic Preservation
Forum, the 1996 summer issue. The article &#147;The Buck Stops .
. . Where?&#148; discusses use of local historic preservation
regulations in the Harry S. Truman Heritage District in
Independence, Missouri. Historic preservation guidelines for <br>
the district were first designated by the City Council in 1974. </p>
<p>Michael Miller recently participated in an affordable housing
workshop sponsored by the National Park Service. The workshop
brought together professionals from a number of state offices
which had successfully used the tax act program in promoting
affordable housing projects. Each discussed their state&#146;s
projects, and the way in which the Secretary <br>
of the Interior&#146;s Standards for Rehabilitation were
implemented in successful and unsuccessful projects. The NPS hope
to use this information in future Interpreting the Standards
Bulletins. </p>

<hr>
<p>After a year in Georgia as your State Historic Preservation Officer, I look back on these past months with both pride and 
gratitude. The Historic Preservation Division has accomplished a great deal in this time. These accomplishments are due to the 
efforts of an experienced, dedicated staff, and we all owe them our thanks. This staff represents individuals who care about 
the work they are doing and take pride in a job well done. I owe them my thanks as well, for all of the time and effort taken to 
advise and assist me as I traveled throughout this impressive state, learning about all the significant resources Georgia has to 
offer. Following are some of the noteworthy highlights of SFY 1995 (July 1, 1994 June 30, 1995): </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Move to the Healey Building</em> - The elevation of the office to Division level status and the subsequent 
move from cramped quarters to the historic setting of the National Register- listed Healey Building brought 
SFY 1995 to a glorious close. We are proud to have our workplace reflect our beliefs in the value of 
continuing to use our grand old buildings, and we will continue to take the opportunity to showcase the 
benefits of rehabilitation and reuse. After seven months in this location, we have begun to settle in, but the 
efforts of the staff space designers, the packers, the movers and the furniture buyers will not soon be 
forgotten. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Flood Assistance Effort - </em>The disaster of the great flood of the summer of 1994 presented HPD with 
many challenges. It was imperative that we provide effective service to our constituents impacted by the flood, 
and, in turn, the opportunity came about to introduce preservation to a broader public through financial and 
technical support. More than 100 rehabilitation projects are being accomplished with the federal funds 
allocated to this office for disaster relief. The benefits of this work expands far beyond any individual projects 
as a greater awareness of the long-term benefits of preservation changes the face of south Georgia 
communities. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Olympian Efforts</em> to maintain the record-breaking rate of review for Olympic-related Section 106 and 
federal and state tax projects have involved planning and technical services staff. Specific 106 projects this 
year in Atlanta have resulted in the creation of a major Memorandum of Agreement for Techwood Homes 
and a major Preservation Agreement for Summerhill that could change the way the City deals with the review 
process in the future. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Reduction of the National Register Backlog</em> - In spite of overwhelming workload increases and a significant 
loss of staff, the National Register unit has reduced the overall backlog of nominations by over 70%. This is a 
tremendous achievement. </p>
<p><em>Improvements in Section 106 Delivery</em> - I am especially proud of the execution of a Preservation 
Agreement with the South Georgia RDC, which will be the model for how the review process can work in the 
future. By involving regional and local agencies more directly in the review and decision-making process, 
critical decisions can be made more quickly and efficiently on a local level. Assisting CLGs This year we 
instituted a new grant system based on the &quot;building blocks plan&quot; to guide skill building for CLGs. This should 
help insure that CLG communities accomplish all the major steps in setting up their local programs and should 
help local decision-making. </p>
<p><em>Working with RDC Preservation Planners</em> - This year we instituted a new contracting system to specify 
mutually agreed upon work items. This insures that preservation planners' time can be focused on specific 
preservation activities, and it standardizes work required from all RDCs. </p>
<p><em>Doubled the Appropriation of the Heritage 2000 Grant Program </em>- This extremely well-received state 
grant program was initiated just two years ago to assist in funding the rehabilitation of historic buildings. The 
level of funding increased from $135,000 the first year to $270,000 the second year, and the number of 
projects almost doubled as well. A total of 32 projects have been funded in only two years; but requests for 
funding far exceed the amount of money available. </p>
<p><em>Educational Programming</em> - Expanded and Improved Frequent requests that we get from the public involve 
the need for more information on HPD programs. We are moving in that direction as quickly as we can with 
plans for a new quarterly newsletter, Preservation Georgia, a revised monthly F.Y.I., and an across the board 
increase in the number of workshops we offer both for the general public and for the preservation 
professional. </p>
<p><em>Archeology Summit</em> - Through recent attempts to identify major issues with professional and amateur 
archeologists, HPD is working to shift budget priorities in order to establish an Archeological Unit within the 
Division. This unit would integrate the functions of the State Archaeologist and current staff archaeologists into 
one office. </p>

<p>&#160;<font size="3"><strong>SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE GEORGIA
STATE HISTORIC PRESERVATION OFFICE </strong></font></p>
<hr>
<p>The Historic Preservation Division of the Georgia Department
of Natural Resources serves as the State Historic Preservation
Office in Georgia. Working in partnership with the U.S.
Department of the Interior and local communities, the Historic
Preservation Division carries out the mandates of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and works to
preserve the historical, architectural and archaeological
resources of Georgia. Through its Management and Information
Unit, Survey and National Register Unit, Technial Services Unit,
and Planning and Local Assistance Unit, the Historic Preservation
Division provides the following services in Georgia: </p>
<p>Identification and Evaluation of Significant Properties. The
Historic Preservation Division is charged with the responsibility
of funding and/or carrying out surveys to locate cultural
resources. Resources are identified through county-wide and
site-specific surveys or through local ctizens. The division is
also responsible for nominating eligible properties to the <a
href="http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/nr.html">National Register of
Historic Places</a>. By recognizing significant cultural
properties, the National Register program serves as a planning
tool to aid federal and state agencies, as well as local
governments and citizens. The identification of significant
properties encourages the development of projects which considers
the importance of these properties and allows for their continued
preservation and/or resue. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cr.nps.gov/pad/taxact.html">Federal and
State Tax Incentive Programs for Preservation</a>. The Tax Reform
Act of 1986 provides a 20% Investment Tax Credit for the
sensitive rehabilitation of income-producing historic properties,
and the Tax Treatment Extension Act of 1980 provides a tax
deduction for owners of both income-producing structures and
owner-occupied residence who have contributed a preservation
easement on their building to a qualified non-profit
organization. The Historic Preservation Division provides
professional opinion on a property's eligibility for these
programs, assists applicants by reviewing applications for tax
certification to determine whether work undertaken meets the
Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, and
forwards applications to the National Park Service with the State
Historic Preservation Officer's recommendations. The office also
administers a matching grant-in-aid program for survey and
planning projects with funding provided by the U.S. Department of
the Interior, and maintains information on other sources of
funding available for preservation projects. </p>
<p>Preservation Review and Community Planning Assistance. The
Historic Preservation Division is responsible for reviewing and
commenting on federally-funded, licensed and permitted projects
to insure that significant cultural resources are identified and
considered, and works with state agencies with similar reviews
required under the Georgia Environmental Policy Act (GEPA). The
Division also assists local communities with planning for the
protection of significant properties by providing information on
a variety of preservation planning tools, such as historic
district zoning, legislation, and preservation components of
community comprehensive plans. In addition, the office works with
many of the state's Regional Development Centers (RDCs) by
providing funding for preservation planning assistance through
the services of Regional Preservation Planners. </p>
<p>Technical Assistance and Information. Through the services of
a professional architectural staff, the Historic Preservation
Division offers assistance and direction for the development of
sound preservation projects and programs in Georgia. The Division
serves as an informational clearinghouse directing inquiries for
assistance to available resources and developing publications,
programs, and workshops to address topics of interest to
preservationists throughout the state. </p>
<p>Archaeological Services. The Office of the State Archaeologist
provides advice and assistance to the Historic Preservation
Division in carrying out the responsibilities of the Georgia
Antiquities Act which encourages the identification,
documentation, and protection of archaeological sites in Georgia,
especially those on sate-owned lands. Currently, services are
provided under contract with West Georgia College, located in
Carrollton, Georgia.</p>

<p>Georgia will be a better place tomorrow than it is today, providing quality communities in which to live, work, learn and 
recreate. Historic places will be widely valued as irreplaceable resources that contribute to our heritage, our economy, our 
neighborhoods, and our sense of who we are as Georgians. Communities and the State will plan for growth and change that 
respects and includes our historic places. Communities will possess the knowledge, the legal and financial tools, and the 
authority to decide how preservation and new development will relate to one another. There will still be distinctions between 
city and suburbs, developing areas and countryside. All Georgians will possess a greater understanding and appreciation of 
our shared heritage in all its variations. People and organizations throughout Georgia will work in partnership to preserve and 
use historic places. Georgia's communities, economy, environment and people will be better because of the preservation of 
historic resources.</p>

<p><a name="goals"><font size=4><em><u>GOALS FOR PRESERVATION IN GEORGIA </u></em></font></a></p>
<p>1. Achieve widespread public awareness and involvement in historic preservation in Georgia.<br>
2. Gather information about all historic resources in Georgia, and make the information accessible for planning, advocacy and 
educational purposes. <br>
3. Secure financial and legal tools sufficient to preserve the significant historic resources in Georgia. <br>
4. Strengthen and expand the coordinated network of historic preservation organizations throughout the state. <br>
5. Protect and use Georgia's historic places so that they may exist into the future.</p>

A Vision for Historic Preservation in Georgia<br>
<br>
Georgia will be a better place tomorrow than it is today, providing quality communities in which<br>
to live, work, learn and recreate. Historic places will be widely valued as irreplaceable resources<br>
that contribute to our heritage, our economy, our neighborhoods, and our sense of who we are as<br>
Georgians. Communities and the State will plan for growth and change that respects and includes<br>
our historic places. Communities will possess the knowledge, the legal and financial tools, and<br>
the authority to decide how preservation and new development will relate to one another. There<br>
will still be distinctions between city and suburbs, developing areas and countryside. All<br>
Georgians will possess a greater understanding and appreciation of our shared heritage in all its<br>
variations. People and organizations throughout Georgia will work in partnership to preserve and<br>
use historic places. Georgia's communities, economy, environment and people will be better<br>
because of the preservation of historic resources.<br>
<br>
<em><strong><u>MISSION STATEMENT</u></strong></em><br>
<br>
The Historic Preservation Division's mission is to promote the preservation and use of historic<br>
places for a better Georgia.<br>
<br>
<em><strong><u>GOALS FOR PRESERVATION IN GEORGIA</u></strong></em><br>
<br>
1. Achieve widespread public awareness and involvement in historic preservation in Georgia.<br>
<br>
2. Gather information about all historic resources in Georgia, and make the information<br>
accessible for planning, advocacy and educational purposes.<br>
<br>
3. Secure financial and legal tools sufficient to preserve the significant historic resources in<br>
Georgia.<br>
<br>
4. Strengthen and expand the coordinated network of historic preservation organizations<br>
throughout the state.<br>
<br>
5. Protect and use Georgia's historic places so that they may exist into the future.<br>
<br>
These five goals represent the consensus of preservationists and other community and state<br>
leaders who helped create this plan. These goals will guide the Historic Preservation Division's<br>
actions, funding priorities, and policies through the year 2000. They are listed in order of priority<br>
and in the order in which preservation activity must take place--at the statewide level and at the<br>
local level--for historic places to truly be protected, preserved, used and appreciated. This plan is<br>
directed toward accomplishing the five goals, in order to make the Vision a reality in Georgia's<br>
future.<br>

<p>CHAPTER TWO<br>
<br>
<font size=4><em><strong><u>Historic Resources in Georgia</u></strong></em></font><br>
</p>
<hr>
<p><br>
Georgia was founded in 1733 as one of the thirteen original American colonies. For the next<br>
two-and-a-half centuries, its history was shaped largely by the activities and interactions of three<br>
peoples: Euro-Americans intent on creating a &quot;New World&quot; in America, African-Americans<br>
largely caught up in the creation of this new world, and American Indians who ultimately were<br>
dispossessed of it. For two centuries prior to English colonization, the Spanish with their African<br>
servants and slaves explored and settled what would later become Georgia. This<br>
African-European presence was itself preceded by thousands of years of American Indian<br>
occupation. <br>
<br>
The 10,000-year history of what we now know as Georgia has left its mark all across the state. <br>
Not only in metropolitan areas, where the signs of development are everywhere, but also in the<br>
most remote mountain valleys, along apparently undeveloped rivers and streams, across vast<br>
stretches of field and forest, deep in seemingly inaccessible swamps, and along coastal marshes<br>
and islands--there is hardly an acre of land in Georgia untouched by the past. <br>
<br>
The evidence of history takes the form of buildings and structures, historic and archeological sites,<br>
historic landscapes and traditional cultural properties, and historic districts. These are Georgia's<br>
historic properties. They provide a window into our past, and a foundation on which to build a<br>
vision for our future. Preserving these historic properties is what historic preservation is all<br>
about.<br>
<br>
An Overview of Georgia's Historic Properties<br>
<br>
Buildings<br>
<br>
For many people, buildings are the most familiar type of historic property in Georgia. Certainly<br>
the most obvious, they dominate Georgia's listings in the National Register of Historic Places. <br>
Usually categorized by function, Georgia's historic buildings include a wide variety of houses,<br>
stores and offices, factories and mills, outbuildings on farms and plantations, and community<br>
landmarks.<br>
<br>
Houses are the most prevalent type of historic building in Georgia. They make up approximately<br>
70% of all the Georgia listings in the National Register and nearly 80% of all surveyed properties. <br>
Most historic houses in Georgia are one-story high with wood frames and siding. Others are built<br>
of brick; a few are constructed of stone. The single-family detached house is the most common<br>
house form in the state, although apartment buildings are found in most larger communities and<br>
rowhouses highlight Savannah. <br>
<br>
Approximately one-third of Georgia's historic housing is located in the state's cities and larger<br>
towns; another third is found in smaller towns; and the remaining third is dispersed throughout the<br>
countryside. Three-quarters of all the extant historic houses in Georgia were built between 1890<br>
and World War II. As important as individual buildings, houses with their landscaped yards and<br>
associated domestic archeological resources form a special category of historic property known as<br>
&quot;Georgia's Living Places.&quot; In rural areas, historic houses serve as the centerpieces of farms and<br>
plantations; in communities, houses grouped together form historic neighborhoods.<br>
<br>
Commercial buildings including stores and offices constitute only about 5% of Georgia's historic<br>
buildings, but they are the second most numerous type of historic building in Georgia. <br>
Commercial buildings tend to be concentrated in communities, often forming a cohesive business<br>
district or &quot;downtown,&quot; although some like the country store are found in sparsely settled rural<br>
areas and others like the corner store are situated in residential neighborhoods. In addition to the<br>
country and corner stores, common Georgia examples include the small-town &quot;storefront&quot;<br>
building, the larger city business block, and the urban skyscraper. <br>
<br>
Brick is a common building material, although wood is used in some rural and small-town<br>
commercial buildings; big-city buildings employ steel and concrete. Most extant historic<br>
commercial buildings in Georgia date from the late 19th through the early 20th centuries.<br>
<br>
Industrial buildings in Georgia are not numerous, constituting only about 1% of all surveyed<br>
buildings, yet they represent some of the largest and most economically important historic<br>
buildings in the state. Georgia's industrial buildings include factories, mills, warehouses, gins, and<br>
multi-purpose lofts. They usually are located in or adjacent to communities, often along rivers or<br>
railroads, sometimes grouped in industrial areas or districts. <br>
<br>
A distinct form of self-contained community, the mill village, grew up around some industrial<br>
buildings, usually late 19th or early 20th century textile mills. In contrast, rural grist mills with<br>
their characteristic dams and millponds are located near sources of waterpower, often in isolated<br>
areas. Most rural mills are constructed of wood with heavy mortised-and-tenoned wood frames,<br>
although a few are built of brick or stone. <br>
<br>
Most of the larger urban factories are constructed of brick with &quot;slow burning&quot; heavy timber<br>
frames. Twentieth-century industrial buildings often were constructed with steel or concrete<br>
frames and concrete and brick walls, for durability and to make them relatively fireproof.<br>
<br>
Agricultural buildings are representative of the major role played by agriculture throughout<br>
Georgia's history. Historically, agriculture dominated land use across the state. Agricultural<br>
buildings are found in most rural areas, usually in complexes, along with other structures and<br>
landscape features comprising farmsteads or plantations. The typical historic Georgia farm<br>
consists of a late 19th or early 20th century farmhouse, half a dozen outbuildings, a yard, and<br>
agricultural land. <br>
Approximately 10% of all surveyed houses in the state are associated with farms. Associated<br>
historic agricultural buildings typically include tenant farmhouses, barns, cotton gins, mills, and<br>
offices, although the complete list of Georgia's agricultural outbuildings is seemingly endless.<br>
<br>
Community landmark buildings are a small but diverse group of historic buildings housing<br>
community institutions such as local governments, religious groups, civic organizations, hospitals,<br>
and schools. Although they account for only about 5% of all surveyed buildings, community<br>
landmarks are prominent due to their large size, architectural treatment, and strategic location. <br>
They are focal points, literally and figuratively, for their communities. Common examples include<br>
courthouses, city halls, post offices, churches, lodges and clubhouses, libraries, jails, depots,<br>
theaters, and community centers.<br>
<br>
Structures<br>
<br>
Structures are defined as &quot;functional constructions made usually for purposes other than creating<br>
shelter.&quot; In other words, structures are not primarily places in which to live or work, although<br>
they may be occupied for short periods of time or used in work or other activities. Many<br>
structures resemble buildings and are differentiated from them only by function; other kinds of<br>
structures are fundamentally different than buildings. Many structures are physically or<br>
functionally related to buildings and are sometimes considered subsidiary to them; some are found<br>
in complexes while others stand alone.<br>
<br>
Common kinds of historic structures in Georgia include wells, water towers, agricultural<br>
outbuildings such as corn cribs or implement sheds, military fortifications, bridges, and railroads<br>
(rail beds). Other familiar although less numerous structures include lighthouses, tunnels, dams,<br>
and locomotives. Less familiar types of structures include mines and quarries.<br>
<br>
Structured Environments<br>
<br>
Another kind of historic structure, less commonly recognized, is what might be called a structured<br>
environment: the large-scale, two-dimensional plans or patterns that underlie and shape historic<br>
development. Historic structured environments are found all across Georgia, in cities, towns, and<br>
rural areas. They include city plans, courthouse squares, the layout of parks, gardens, cemeteries,<br>
and yards, agricultural field patterns, and land-lot lines.<br>
<br>
Sites<br>
<br>
A site is defined as &quot;the location of a significant event ... occupation, or activity, or a building or<br>
structure, whether standing, ruined, or vanished, where the location itself possesses historic,<br>
cultural, or archeological value ....&quot; There are several distinct types of sites in Georgia.<br>
<br>
Archeological sites, both historic and prehistoric, are the most numerous if not the most familiar<br>
type of historic property in Georgia. More than 25,000 archeological sites are recorded in the<br>
Georgia Archeological Site File. Approximately 2,000 newly discovered sites are added each<br>
year, yet only a small fraction of the state has been surveyed methodically for archeological<br>
resources.<br>
<br>
A wide variety of archeological sites exists in Georgia. Some sites are complex &quot;stratified&quot; sites,<br>
with various layers representing different periods of occupation and use. Other complex sites are<br>
&quot;multi-component&quot; locations of prehistoric villages. Less complex sites may represent a single<br>
activity or use, such as hunting or fishing, manufacturing or quarrying, or camping. Archeological<br>
sites in Georgia usually contain artifacts made from stone, bone, ceramic, metal, wood, paper, and<br>
glass, even fabric, food remains, and plant matter. Major river valleys, ridge lines, and the Fall<br>
Line have yielded the greatest numbers of archeological sites. A less well-known type of<br>
archeological site, the underwater site, is found on river bottoms, in coastal marshes, and off the<br>
coast on the continental shelf. <br>
<br>
Prehistoric Indians built monumental architecture, in the form of earthen and stone mounds<br>
scattered over the Georgia landscape, since the beginning of the Christian era. They were most<br>
pronounced in the period 1250-1500 A.D. Many still stand.<br>
<br>
Prehistoric archeological sites in Georgia include earthen mounds and platforms, shell middens in<br>
the form of piles and rings, rock quarries, fishing weirs, rock piles, scattered stone chips, and<br>
concentrations of broken pottery. Examples of historic archeological sites include Revolutionary<br>
and Civil War trenches and earthworks, industrial sites, subsurface evidence of former landscape<br>
features, buildings, and structures such as the former Cherokee Nation capitol at New Echota,<br>
and refuse dumps. Underwater archeological sites include submerged ships, piers and wharfs,<br>
building foundations, trash dumps, river crossings, and evidence of former waterfront activities. <br>
Graves also can be considered as archeological sites, although state and federal laws protecting<br>
burial sites severely restrict their archeological investigation.<br>
<br>
Historic sites are places where a significant event or activity took place but where there were no<br>
buildings or structures associated with the event or activity or where the associated buildings or<br>
structures no longer exist. Historic sites are important primarily for the events or activities which<br>
took place there, although significant archeological resources also may be present at the site. <br>
<br>
Historic sites may be characterized by distinctive natural features, like a mountain or cave or tree,<br>
or they may simply be the place where something important happened, like an open field. Good<br>
examples of historic sites in Georgia are the Jeff Davis Capture Site in Irwin County and the<br>
Bloody Marsh battle site in Glynn County. Historic sites are often marked by historic markers or<br>
plaques.<br>
<br>
Traditional cultural properties are a newly recognized type of historic site. This type may be a<br>
distinctive natural place (such as a mountaintop) or historic environment (such as an ethnic<br>
neighborhood), or it may be simply a spatial location, a place, having pronounced historic cultural<br>
value to a living racial, ethnic, or cultural group today. Historical associations with such<br>
properties may be demonstrated through historical documentation, but more likely through<br>
traditional uses or practices, oral history, or common cultural knowledge. Because traditional<br>
cultural properties may be significant for metaphysical reasons, they may be especially difficult to<br>
detect by &quot;outsiders.&quot; Although no traditional cultural properties have been officially recognized<br>
in Georgia, several have been tentatively identified.<br>
<br>
Landscapes<br>
<br>
Landscapes are a special type of historic property combining elements of &quot;sites&quot; and &quot;structures&quot;<br>
and often including buildings as well. Most historic landscapes also contain archeological<br>
resources. Historic landscapes often are overlooked, taken for granted, or misunderstood as<br>
&quot;natural&quot; resources.<br>
<br>
Georgia contains a variety of historic landscapes. They range from small formal gardens to vast<br>
expanses of agricultural countryside and planted woodlands. Typical examples are courthouse<br>
squares (often the largest public landscape space in a community), city parks, streetscapes in<br>
neighborhoods with their street trees and sidewalks, and cemeteries. A well-documented type of<br>
historic landscape in Georgia is the yard; nine major forms of historic domestic landscaping have<br>
been identified through the Georgia's Living Places project.<br>
<br>
Historic Districts<br>
<br>
Historic districts are another special type of historic resource. Defined as &quot;a significant<br>
concentration, linkage, or continuity of sites, buildings, structures, or objects united historically or<br>
aesthetically by plan or physical development,&quot; a historic district contains a combination of the<br>
other types of historic properties--buildings, structures, sites, landscapes, structured<br>
environments--where the overall grouping, the ensemble, takes on an identity and significance<br>
greater than the individual components. <br>
<br>
Historic districts make up about 25% of Georgia's National Register listings, yet they include<br>
more than 95% of all the historic properties listed in the National Register. Because they contain<br>
such a variety of historic properties, in their historic spatial relationships, historic districts best<br>
represent what our historic environments really were like.<br>
<br>
The most common type of historic district in Georgia is the residential neighborhood. Second in<br>
frequency is the downtown central business district. Other important but less numerous types of<br>
historic districts include industrial and warehousing areas, school campuses, military installations,<br>
parks, and waterfronts. Georgia has several extensive archeological districts containing<br>
historically and geographically related sites, such as the Etowah Valley district, and several vast<br>
rural historic districts containing multiple farms, rural communities, and historic rural landscapes,<br>
such as McLemore Cove and the Sautee-Nacoochee Valleys.<br>
<br>
How Many Are There?<br>
<br>
It is estimated that there are about 71,500 historic buildings in Georgia at the present time. Field<br>
survey information on over 26,000 buildings has been entered into the Historic Preservation<br>
Division's computerized database. Previously unsurveyed buildings are being added to the<br>
inventory at the rate of about 5,000 per year.<br>
<br>
Nobody knows exactly how many archeological sites exist in Georgia; because they are mostly<br>
underground (or under water), they are difficult to locate without expert field investigation. At<br>
the present time, more than 25,000 archeological sites have been identified and recorded in the<br>
University of Georgia's Archeological Site File, yet only a small percentage of the state's land area<br>
has been systematically searched for archeological sites. Newly discovered archeological sites are<br>
being reported at the rate of nearly 2,000 per year.<br>
<br>
Why do these numbers keep changing?<br>
<br>
The number of known and estimated historic properties in Georgia changes frequently, with good<br>
reason. On the one hand, known historic properties are lost due to demolition, remodeling, or<br>
destruction every year. A historic building may burn to the ground, or an archeological site may<br>
be bulldozed for a new shopping center. On the other hand, with the passage of time, properties<br>
that formerly were not old enough to be considered historic come of age, so to speak, and the<br>
expanding scope of history and archeology encompass properties not previously recognized as<br>
historic. In addition, continuing and improved field surveys identify more historic properties<br>
every year, and provide a better basis for estimating the total number of historic properties in the<br>
state. So, while the number of historic properties in Georgia at any given point in time is finite, it<br>
will change over time.<br>
<br>
Why are more historic properties being identified?<br>
<br>
The process of identifying and evaluating historic properties lies at the very heart of historic<br>
preservation. By its very nature, it is a continuing, neverending process. Just as time marches on,<br>
so does history, and historic preservation with it. <br>
<br>
The study of history and the practice of archeology, both of which underlie historic preservation,<br>
are dynamic. Both are constantly expanding. For example, historians are now studying what is<br>
called the &quot;recent past&quot;--the period from World War II through the 1960s--while archeologists are<br>
pushing back the dates of human occupation in Georgia to 10,000 years and more. Historians<br>
continue to expand on the achievements of Georgia's African-Americans with special interest in<br>
the 1960s Civil Rights movement, while archeologists and ethnologists are beginning to document<br>
American Indian traditional cultural properties overlooked in previous surveys. If we were to try<br>
to limit our universe of historic properties to only those previously recognized by historians and<br>
archeologists, we would be undermining the very basis of the historic preservation movement.<br>
<br>
Continuing and improving field surveys are identifying more historic properties than ever before<br>
all across the state. For example, a recently completed county survey identified 20 times the<br>
number of historic properties recorded in a 1970s survey of the county. By restricting the number<br>
of historic properties to those previously surveyed, we would be denying the obvious fact that<br>
many more historic properties exist.<br>
<br>
An expanding historic preservation constituency is bringing with it a broader view of historic<br>
properties. For example, increased participation by African-Americans has encouraged the<br>
broader recognition of African-American historic properties from the earliest days of exploration<br>
and settlement to the mid-20th-century Civil Rights movement. Interest on the part of American<br>
Indian groups has led to a heightened sensitivity to many types of prehistoric sites, particularly<br>
burials and traditional cultural properties. The important role played by women in historic<br>
preservation has resulted in new interest in women's history and associated historic properties. If<br>
we were to limit historic properties to those that we know now, many new interest groups would<br>
find their heritage excluded from the historic preservation movement. As more cultural and<br>
interest groups discover their heritage, their desire to preserve the historic places associated with<br>
that heritage grows.<br>
<br>
In short: to limit our universe of historic properties to what is currently known would artificially<br>
constrain historic preservation and directly controvert the intent of the National Historic<br>
Preservation Act which is to preserve properties which represent the &quot;broad patterns&quot; of<br>
American history as we best understand it.<br>
<br>
How many historic properties have been lost?<br>
<br>
No one knows how many archeological sites have been destroyed over the years. But every time<br>
ground-disturbing activity takes place, there is the potential for additional loss.<br>
<br>
It is clear, however, that the vast majority of all the historic buildings and structures that ever<br>
existed in Georgia already have been lost. In just the last 50 years, nearly three-quarters of the<br>
buildings and structures that existed prior to World War II have been lost through destruction or<br>
remodeling. And in some counties, more than one-quarter of the surveyed historic properties that<br>
existed twenty years ago are now gone.<br>
<br>
What kinds of buildings have been lost? Whose heritage has vanished? No detailed study has<br>
been done, but it appears that the greatest losses have been vernacular buildings, modest houses,<br>
tenant farm houses which once dotted every 40 acres or so, many utilitarian structures like mule<br>
barns, liveries, and warehouses, and many homes associated with African-Americans in cities,<br>
towns, and rural areas. Yet virtually every community has lost its share of local landmark<br>
buildings as well--stylish houses, sometimes whole streets of them, grand old hotels, business<br>
blocks, railroad depots, even courthouses.<br>
<br>
What Makes All These Properties &quot;Historic?&quot;<br>
<br>
To be considered &quot;historic,&quot; a property must have three essential attributes: sufficient age, a<br>
relatively high degree of integrity, and significance in history.<br>
<br>
Age<br>
<br>
A historic property must be old enough to be considered &quot;historic.&quot; Historic properties are, by<br>
definition, old, not new. Generally speaking, this means that a property must be at least 50 years<br>
old, although this is just a general rule, not an absolute requirement. Another way of looking at it<br>
is that a property must be old enough to be understood for the role it played in the community,<br>
state or nation so that its place in history is clear.<br>
<br>
Integrity<br>
<br>
In addition to having sufficient age, a property must also have retained what is called its<br>
&quot;integrity&quot; to be considered historic. For a building, structure, landscape feature, historic site, or<br>
historic district, this means that the property must be relatively unchanged. Its essential<br>
character-defining features must still be present. For an archeological site, integrity means that<br>
the site must be relatively undisturbed, with its patterns and layers of artifacts and other<br>
archeological evidence relatively intact. For a traditional cultural property, integrity means that<br>
the site must be recognizable to today's affiliated cultural group, documentable through tradition,<br>
and still used or revered in some way.<br>
<br>
Significance<br>
<br>
Finally, a property must be significant to be considered historic. Significance is generally defined<br>
in three ways: through direct association with individuals, events, activities, or developments that<br>
were important in the past--that shaped our history, or that reflect important aspects of our<br>
history; by embodying the distinctive physical and spatial characteristics of an architectural style<br>
or type of building, structure, landscape, or planned environment, or a method of construction, or<br>
by embodying high artistic values or fine craftsmanship; or by having the potential to yield<br>
information important to our understanding of the past through archeological, architectural, or<br>
other physical investigation and analysis.<br>
<br>
Who Decides What is Historic?<br>
<br>
Each of us may have our own personal opinions about what is historic and what is not. Similarly,<br>
different social and cultural groups of people may have different definitions of &quot;historic.&quot; Other<br>
interest groups in our society may look at historic properties in entirely different ways, or may not<br>
value them at all. An important part of historic preservation is the establishment of public<br>
processes through which consensus can be reached as to what is historic and what is not. Once<br>
this consensus has been reached, it becomes public preservation policy. There are several<br>
established ways in Georgia of publicly determining whether properties are historic and worthy of<br>
being preserved.<br>
<br>
National Register of Historic Places<br>
<br>
One of the most important ways in which we determine which of our properties are historic and<br>
which are not is the National Register of Historic Places. Ever since its creation by Congress<br>
through the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the National Register has been one of the<br>
foundations of historic preservation in Georgia and across the country. It provides uniform<br>
standards, a public process, and a national perspective for determining the significance and<br>
preservation worthiness of properties. Although the criteria for determining National Register<br>
eligibility are essentially unchanged since 1966, their interpretation and application to properties<br>
are continuously clarified and updated through published guidance and bulletins. Listing in the<br>
National Register, or determining National Register eligibility, is one of the clearest statements of<br>
public policy about what is historic and worthy of being preserved.<br>
<br>
At the present time there are more than 1,600 official Georgia listings in the National Register<br>
representing more than 38,000 historic properties in the state. Historic properties in Georgia are<br>
being added to the National Register at the rate of approximately 45 listings representing some<br>
1,750 historic properties per year. Georgia ranks about 10th in the nation in the number of<br>
National Register-listed properties.<br>
<br>
Georgia Register of Historic Places<br>
<br>
Established in 1989, the Georgia Register of Historic Places is our state's companion to the<br>
National Register of Historic Places. Modeled closely after the National Register, the Georgia<br>
Register is Georgia's official statewide list of historic properties worthy of being preserved. <br>
Properties listed in the National Register are automatically listed in the Georgia Register.<br>
<br>
Local Designations<br>
<br>
Another important way of determining the significance and preservation worthiness of properties<br>
in Georgia is through local landmark or historic district designation. Under the provisions of the<br>
Georgia Historic Preservation Act of 1980, local governments can pass historic preservation<br>
ordinances which specify procedures for designating historic properties in their jurisdictions. <br>
Local designation provides some level of protection for those properties. Designations may vary<br>
from community to community, reflecting local conditions, needs, goals, and prerogatives. At the<br>
present time, approximately 80 local governments in Georgia have enacted historic preservation<br>
ordinances and appointed preservation commissions.<br>
<br>
Planning<br>
<br>
Yet another way that local communities can define their historic properties is through local<br>
comprehensive plans. As required by the Georgia Planning Act of 1989, local comprehensive<br>
plans must include consideration of historic properties. While this consideration can vary widely<br>
from community to community, and while these plans do not have the force of local designations<br>
under a preservation ordinance, local comprehensive plans can provide an opportunity for<br>
communities to express an opinion about what is locally considered historic and worthy of being<br>
preserved. Other land use planning tools, including zoning ordinances, sign and tree ordinances,<br>
and others can be used to delineate and designate historic places. <br>
<br>
Historical Markers<br>
<br>
The state historical marker program, administered by the Department of Natural Resources, uses<br>
unique criteria and procedures to identify properties of statewide significance. The oldest of the<br>
many ways in which historic properties are identified in Georgia, the marker program dates back<br>
to the early 1950s. Through the marker program, former as well as extant historic properties are<br>
officially recognized. Currently there are nearly 2,000 state historical markers in Georgia. They<br>
are accompanied by uncounted numbers of local and regional historical markers.<br>
<br>
Exactly How Are Properties Determined to be Historic?<br>
<br>
Although there are several different ways of determining whether properties are historic, all of<br>
these processes share certain essential steps. These common steps constitute a fundamental<br>
historic preservation routine, or methodology. <br>
<br>
The first step consists of gathering information about a specific property --the facts, so to<br>
speak--including a physical description and historical documentation. <br>
<br>
The second step involves putting the individual property in its place in history, seeing how it &quot;fits&quot;<br>
into the larger scheme of things, historically speaking. Useful ways of doing this include<br>
comparing and contrasting it to similar properties, to historically related properties, or to other<br>
properties in the same vicinity (see Appendix B for more information). Another useful way is to<br>
determine how the property relates to the &quot;distinctive aspects&quot; of Georgia's history (see sidebar).<br>
<br>
The third step consists of applying criteria for evaluation to the property and what is known about<br>
it--a yardstick for measuring its significance--such as the National Register of Historic Places<br>
&quot;Criteria for Evaluation&quot; or the designation standards found in a local historic preservation<br>
ordinance. Each step of the process involves public input and participation along with appropriate<br>
professional involvement. Taken together, these three steps constitute the basic methodology for<br>
determining the significance of properties.<br>
<br>
Why Preserve Historic Properties?<br>
<br>
Above and beyond their historical significance, why are Georgia's historic properties valuable<br>
resources? Why should they be preserved? The answers are many, and varied.<br>
<br>
Historic properties are tangible evidence of our history. They bring history to life in ways that no<br>
written or even audio-visual materials can do. In doing so, they help us better understand who we<br>
are today, as individuals and as a people, and how things got to be the way they are.<br>
<br>
Historic properties also contribute to a sense of place. They make one place different from<br>
another and make each community unique. They reinforce the lessons of history while<br>
strengthening our identity. They provide a framework for new development; they add variety to<br>
our everyday surroundings.<br>
<br>
Historic properties also represent an enormous investment of time, money, energy, and<br>
materials--resources which, like all other nonrenewable resources, should be used wisely and<br>
conserved. Additionally, historic properties can continue in productive service in everyday life,<br>
either for the use for which they were originally intended, or adapted to new or upgraded uses.<br>
<br>
Historic properties enrich the quality of our lives by presenting for our benefit a variety of<br>
architectural styles, construction materials, and craftsmanship which appears nowhere else in our<br>
physical environment.<br>
<br>
And historic properties literally embody knowledge--about ourselves and our past, as well as<br>
themselves--which can be recovered for the benefit of all through careful archeological or<br>
architectural investigation and conservation.<br>

<font size=5><strong>Georgia Now and in the Future</strong></font><br>
</p>
<hr>
<p><br>
As we approach the end of the twentieth century, historic preservation continues to become a<br>
more integral part of the social, economic, and political landscape in the nation as well as in<br>
Georgia. The preservation of historic properties has become one of many quality of life issues<br>
facing our state. Historic resources are affected by many kinds of development, societal and<br>
financial trends. In planning for preservation, it is essential to examine the major trends occurring<br>
in the state and in communities and how those trends affect Georgia's historic resources. <br>
Many Georgians are concerned about the proliferation of unplanned growth that is resulting in<br>
urban sprawl and unsightly development. They look to historic preservation as one method to<br>
help maintain viable communities and improve the quality of life.<br>
<br>
It is important to understand changes that are affecting the state as a whole so that preservation<br>
programs in Georgia can be designed to respond in the most effective manner. In this way,<br>
historic places will more likely help shape Georgia's future.<br>
<br>
Fast-Changing Population <br>
<br>
Statewide Trends<br>
<br>
Population change is transforming Georgia. The major population trends facing Georgia are the<br>
rapid growth taking place in the suburban areas of the state, especially within 100 miles of<br>
Atlanta, and the continued decrease within large cities and rural areas. These diverse directions<br>
in population affect economic activity, existing and planned infrastructure, governmental policies,<br>
and land use decisions, which in turn affect historic resources.<br>
<br>
Georgia is currently the tenth most populated--and one of the fastest growing--states in the<br>
nation, estimated in 1995 to have a population of almost 7.2 million. The 1980s was the first<br>
decade in history that Georgia experienced more population increase from net migration than<br>
from natural increase. Throughout the 1990s and into the new century, Georgia will continue to<br>
grow.<br>
<br>
The age makeup of Georgia is also changing. For the first time, Georgia is in the top ten<br>
nationally in states attracting new elderly residents. Between 1985 and 1990, 44,475 people<br>
sixty-five and older moved into Georgia and more retirees decided to leave Florida for Georgia<br>
than those who went the other way. Notwithstanding the growing elderly population, Georgia's<br>
population is young, with a median age of 31.8 years. The high population of young people can<br>
be directly attributed to the favorable job market created by Georgia's expanding economy. <br>
<br>
Georgia ranks fifth in African-American population nationally, with 1.8 million persons<br>
comprising 27% of the state's population. <br>
<br>
Between 1980 and 1990, 43 Georgia counties lost population, 77 grew at less than the state<br>
average, and 40 grew faster than the state average. By combining these population trends with<br>
urban and rural characteristics, the state can be subdivided into four major population areas. Four<br>
distinct &quot;Georgias&quot; emerge from this classification: suburban, urban, growing rural and declining<br>
rural counties.<br>
<br>
Suburban Georgia<br>
<br>
Riding the crest of population growth is the metropolitan Atlanta area, especially the suburban<br>
and exurban portions within 100 miles of the central city. More than 66% of the total population<br>
of Georgia lives in the Atlanta region. Georgia has three of the top ten fastest growing counties<br>
in the United States. Two of these, Henry and Paulding counties, lie within the metro Atlanta<br>
area. The population of the 14-county metro Atlanta region grew nearly 70% from 1970 to 1990,<br>
exceeding the state growth rate by 25%. During the same time period, Cobb and Gwinnett<br>
counties each increased by more than 250,000 residents, while Fayette County added 50,000 new<br>
residents, growing at an astonishing rate of 550%. Eight of the counties in the region grew at<br>
rates in excess of 200%.<br>
<br>
Urban Georgia<br>
<br>
The population of Georgia's cities as a percentage of the total state population is steadily<br>
decreasing. In 1960, 54% of the state's citizens lived in cities. In 1992, only 39% lived within<br>
city boundaries. Many Georgia cities are becoming a workplace for the middle class, but a home <br>
predominantly to the very wealthy or to minorities and the poor. Growth in the suburbs often<br>
comes at the expense of urbanized areas. Every major Georgia central city is experiencing a<br>
middle-class population decline. <br>
<br>
Rural Areas of Growth<br>
<br>
The rural growth areas of Georgia tend to be located in the northern portion of the state or along<br>
the coast. These counties either possess scenic beauty, and thus attract tourists and retirees, are<br>
located near a military base, or are regional economic centers.<br>
<br>
Rural Areas of Decline<br>
<br>
Rural areas declining in population face the most uncertain future. These areas, concentrated in<br>
the southern half of the state, are characterized by long-term population loss, lack of employment<br>
opportunities and continued high levels of outmigration of working age people, leaving behind a<br>
large number of young and older residents. <br>
<br>
Effects of Population Trends<br>
<br>
The effects of changing population on the historic resources of Georgia vary depending upon the<br>
area of the state. Areas of suburban growth create different concerns and opportunities for<br>
historic property than do areas of rural or urban decline.<br>
<br>
The rapid growth being experienced on the suburban fringe of metropolitan areas creates<br>
widespread change in the landscape and pressure on existing infrastructure and historic resources. <br>
Similar pressures exist in the rural growth areas of the north Georgia mountains and along the<br>
Atlantic coast. In areas of strip developments, residential subdivisions and suburban sprawl,<br>
infrastructure must expand to satisfy a growing population's need for clean water, sewers, roads,<br>
and utilities. These changes often come at the expense of open space, historic landscapes, historic<br>
buildings and archeological sites. <br>
<br>
Anticipating and reacting to rapid growth requires time, effort and planning. Only one-third of<br>
Georgia's 159 counties have enacted any kind of zoning ordinance, although this is slowly<br>
changing. The potential for uncontrolled sprawl is greatest when the local community has not<br>
planned for growth, and has no land use controls in place. In this case,developers often make<br>
more of the decisions about the future of a community than the residents or elected officials. <br>
Georgia has mandated that local governments must produce a comprehensive plan, including an<br>
existing and future land use map, under the Georgia Planning Act of 1989. A required<br>
component of these plans is a section on historic resources and how the community intends to<br>
incorporate these resources into future development.<br>
<br>
Comprehensive planning is a good first step for communities to think about what type of future<br>
they want. Often, however, the plans are not implemented and are not incorporated into local<br>
land use regulations. It is important for local governments to realize that planning is not in<br>
conflict with growth, but is a way to preserve those aspects of a community that are important to<br>
its quality of life, while guiding the growth that will occur. Comprehensive land use planning and<br>
regulation can be an effective tool to achieve growth management and historic preservation goals.<br>
<br>
One method by which planning can promote growth while maintaining a community's character<br>
and quality of life is through a concept called &quot;sustainability.&quot; This approach to community<br>
planning emphasizes long-term planning, rather than meeting only immediate needs, and the<br>
exploration of creative approaches to accomplish change. Sustainable development techniques<br>
include the acknowledgement that factors such as land use, environmental concerns, housing and<br>
transportation systems are overlapping issues that require an integrated strategy, not isolated<br>
solutions. The goal of sustainable development is to create communities of enduring value and<br>
long-term viability. A component of sustainable development is &quot;neo-traditional design,&quot; that is,<br>
using traditional (historic) development patterns in the creation of new urban and suburban<br>
communities. <br>
<br>
The growing interest in sustainable communities among both environmentalists and<br>
preservationists will provide opportunities for conservation and preservation organizations to<br>
work together more in the future. The rapid sprawl that characterizes Georgia's fast-paced<br>
growth adversely affects both natural and historic resources and may become the top issue for<br>
preservationists and conservationists as we approach the year 2000.<br>
<br>
The urban areas of Georgia face some of the same development pressures, especially on their<br>
edges, but they have a much higher concentration of historic resources within their central<br>
business districts and intown neighborhoods. Decaying and outdated infrastructure, underutilized<br>
buildings, vacant lots and a perception of crime and neglect are often seen as roadblocks to<br>
preservation. Here, the threats to historic resources often come from deferred maintenance,<br>
abandonment, disinvestment, or new development at any cost. The prosperity of the suburbs at<br>
the expense of the central city is a shortsighted approach to regional social and economic success. <br>
A strong central city and intown neighborhoods can serve as a solid foundation for sustained,<br>
long-term vitality. Historic preservation can be an effective tool to facilitate the revitalization of<br>
our urban areas. <br>
<br>
Housing rehabilitation programs can provide affordable homes to inner-city residents. <br>
Preservation can also lure middle income residents back into the city. The residential rebirth of<br>
cities is the single most important factor in their revitalization. Facade rehabilitation programs can<br>
act as an incentive for owners of commercial property to improve their buildings, and can work in<br>
conjunction with the federal Investment Tax Credit to provide a stimulus for the revitalization of<br>
commercial areas. <br>
<br>
Rural areas experiencing population decline are perhaps at greatest risk. With little economic<br>
activity, the historic resources in these smaller communities face neglect, high vacancy rates and<br>
abandonment. If any interest is shown in these buildings, it is often for their salvage potential, or<br>
for relocation. In addition, archeological sites in rural areas are threatened by looters, taking<br>
advantage of the growing market for artifacts.<br>
<br>
With a declining population and few employment opportunities for residents in these rural areas,<br>
job creation is a major priority. Many rural communities in Georgia have used historic<br>
preservation as a basis for community and economic revitalization. Using the Main Street<br>
approach of using the existing downtown infrastructure and historic building stock, these<br>
communities have brought businesses, promotions, residents and a sense of community pride back<br>
to declining business districts.<br>
<br>
Historic buildings are sometimes erroneously associated with a community's decline while new<br>
buildings seem to symbolize economic revitalization. The underpinning for any efforts to use<br>
historic preservation is education. Residents need to be made aware that historic resources are<br>
what helps to make their community a special place. They need to know what makes these<br>
buildings, sites and places historically significant, worthy of preservation, and important for the<br>
community's future. <br>
<br>
The large percentage of black Georgians will have an increasing impact on preservation. Interest<br>
in the historic African-American resources of Georgia is increasing at the same time those<br>
resources are rapidly disappearing. More information about the importance of black history and<br>
the places associated with it needs to be made available to a widespread audience. Awareness of<br>
the importance of historic preservation and support for it statewide by the African-American<br>
community will be a significant factor in the ultimate success of preservation in Georgia.<br>
<br>
Housing Trends<br>
<br>
According to 1990 census data, Georgia contains 2.6 million total housing units. Of this total,<br>
10.3% or 271,000 units are vacant. It is estimated that almost 382,000 units or 14.3% of the total<br>
were constructed before 1950.<br>
<br>
The number of persons per household has declined in Georgia by almost 52%, from 4.4 persons in<br>
1930, to 2.6 in 1990. Although household size has decreased, the number of households has<br>
increased dramatically. The population grew by 18.6% in the 1980s, but the number of<br>
households grew by 26.4%. Of all households, 54% contain either one or two persons, and only<br>
10% contain five or more persons.<br>
<br>
Homelessness, housing for people with special needs, and affordability of housing are problems<br>
the state and communities will continue to confront. Historic resources can play a larger role in<br>
providing solutions. Historic hotels and warehouses are being converted to Single Room<br>
Occupancy housing or halfway houses for the homeless, people with AIDS, and the elderly. <br>
Intown historic neighborhoods offer the best chance for creating affordable neighborhoods<br>
through rehabilitation. <br>
<br>
The retention or increase of middle and upper income residents in the central or intown<br>
neighborhoods in order to create viable communities is a growing issue in Georgia's cities. <br>
Recycling of intown historic neighborhoods contributes to downtown revitalization -- by creating<br>
24-hour downtowns -- and to sustainable development for more viable downtowns and intown<br>
neighborhoods.<br>
<br>
Effects of Housing Trends<br>
<br>
The creation of additional housing units increases pressure on the state's historic resources<br>
through the demolition of historic buildings and the destruction of archeological sites. Yet<br>
historic buildings offer exceptional opportunities for creative solutions to many of Georgia's<br>
housing needs.<br>
<br>
Economic Trends<br>
<br>
Economic activity in Georgia has rebounded since the recession of the early 1990s. More new<br>
jobs have been created in Georgia over the past four years than in all but two other states. In<br>
1994, one out of every nine jobs created in the nation was created in Georgia and the 1990 per<br>
capita income of the state was 91% of the national average, up 6% from 1980. In 1994 alone,<br>
132 new manufacturing plants were announced in Georgia, representing a 176% increase in the<br>
value of such investments over 1993. Even without Olympic related construction, which has<br>
accounted for much of the activity, Georgia has enjoyed significant economic growth over the last<br>
ten years. <br>
<br>
From 1984 to 1990, Georgia's total personal income increased by 60.9%, while the national<br>
average grew by only 50.4%. Two factors are primarily responsible for this increase. First, the<br>
growth is related to large numbers of well educated, new residents with high incomes. Second,<br>
Georgia enjoys a diversified economy comprised of manufacturing, agribusiness, the defense<br>
industry, services and tourism. This diversity has enabled the state to weather economic<br>
recessions better than other areas of the country. In the future, Georgia will continue changing<br>
from a manufacturing and natural resource based economy to an information and service-retail<br>
driven one that will require a better educated and highly skilled work force. <br>
<br>
Agriculture<br>
<br>
Agriculture remains the number one economic activity in Georgia. The forestry and timber<br>
industry is the leading agricultural activity, but there has been a significant and long-term decline<br>
both in the total number of farms and in the proportion of the state's land in farms over the last 40<br>
years. The total number of farms has decreased steadily from about 200,000 in 1950 to just over<br>
40,000 in 1992. Likewise, the proportion of the state in farmland has gone from almost 70% in<br>
1950 to 27% in 1992. Through mechanization and higher yields per acre, fewer farmers can<br>
produce more. Land has become valuable in growth areas for residential and commercial<br>
development, tempting farmers to sell their land.<br>
<br>
Effects of Economic Trends<br>
<br>
The effects of economic trends on historic resources closely parallel those of population. With<br>
strong economies in north Georgia, portions of the mountains and along the coast, development<br>
threatens the preservation of historic places. Development changes the landscape in profound and<br>
permanent ways. Construction of new roads, utilities, infrastructure and buildings results in loss<br>
of open space, historic structures, and archeological sites which are gone forever. Creative<br>
planning efforts need to be undertaken to allow for sustainable growth, while at the same time<br>
integrating existing historic and cultural resources. <br>
<br>
The vibrant economy of north Georgia and the coast also presents an opportunity for the<br>
preservation of historic areas. New businesses can be located in historic commercial districts,<br>
unused mill complexes or historic school buildings no longer needed for education. Declining<br>
inner-city neighborhoods can be revitalized with new residents living in historic homes or<br>
compatible infill construction. Developers need to be made aware of the advantages of using<br>
historic buildings for their projects. Information about the cost/benefit ratio of rehabilitating<br>
historic buildings, the available tax benefits, and positive economic effects of preservation on a<br>
community need to be communicated to decision makers and developers.<br>
<br>
The rehabilitation of historic structures is competitive with the cost of comparable new<br>
construction, especially when the available incentives are used for preservation, and when the full<br>
costs of demolition, land development and infrastructure are included in the cost of new<br>
construction. A new building will often be a structure of much lower quality and have a shorter<br>
life expectancy than a rehabilitated historic building. High quality new construction, comparable<br>
to the historic building, will generally cost more. Too often, the cost of rehabilitation is compared<br>
to new construction costs merely on a per-square-foot basis. Such an approach is misleading<br>
because it fails to factor in the savings offered by rehabilitation since demolition, infrastructure<br>
and land preparation costs are often not required for preservation.<br>
<br>
Within the urban core of Georgia's major cities, and in declining rural areas, historic resources are<br>
not threatened with development, but with disinvestment. Underused commercial storefronts,<br>
unused upper floors of downtown buildings, and declining residential neighborhoods are threats to<br>
the future of historic resources of these communities. The utilization of existing infrastructure<br>
and buildings in these areas can be a less costly use of available economic development capital<br>
than the more expensive process of land acquisition, demolition, new construction and the<br>
extension of costly infrastructure and services. Use of existing structures by the private sector<br>
and government can help bring economic vitality back to depressed inner cities and rural<br>
communities.<br>
<br>
Governmental Change<br>
<br>
Since the passage of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the federal government has<br>
provided support for preservation through educational programs, technical assistance, tax<br>
incentives and funding. This support has been critical to preservation efforts throughout Georgia. <br>
Since 1980, however, the financial support received in Georgia from federal sources has been<br>
tenuous. Given the current political climate at the federal level, the trend of uncertain and<br>
probably declining federal appropriations is expected to continue. State government has helped to<br>
respond to the fast growing interest in preservation and the need for technical and financial<br>
assistance in an environment of diminishing federal support. However, state government is also<br>
undergoing cuts, privatization and reorganization. How such change will affect preservation<br>
programs and funding is unclear.<br>
<br>
The major trend in government at all levels is a public perception that there is too much<br>
government, that government is too intrusive. All government activities are coming under<br>
increased scrutiny. The government's role in historic preservation will be questioned.<br>
<br>
Federal Government Influence<br>
<br>
Although its financial support is decreasing, the federal government maintains support for historic<br>
preservation in several ways. Through the investment tax credit and the low-income tax credit<br>
programs, the Internal Revenue Service allows investors to receive a tax credit on the<br>
rehabilitation of historic commercial property and the creation of low-income housing. The<br>
National Park Service provides appropriations for state preservation programs, administers the<br>
National Register of Historic Places, and distributes technical information about preservation<br>
issues. Congress has recently created a National Center for Preservation Technology and<br>
Training to assist in that effort. <br>
<br>
The Department of Housing and Urban Development, through its Community Development<br>
Block Grant, HOME and HOPE programs, provides millions of dollars in funding to Georgia that<br>
can be used for the rehabilitation of substandard historic housing units. The Federal Highway<br>
Administration, through the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA),<br>
has allowed federal transportation dollars to be used by the Georgia Department of<br>
Transportation for transportation enhancements that can include the acquisition and rehabilitation<br>
of historic properties and the enhancement of historic sites and districts. <br>
<br>
The Department of Defense has instituted the Legacy Program, designed to preserve historic<br>
resources located on military bases. The U.S.D.A. Forest Service has actively surveyed, managed<br>
and interpreted the extensive array of historic and archeological resources on its lands in Georgia<br>
for twenty years. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation continues to work with all<br>
federal agencies to insure that they meet their responsibilities under Section 106 of the National<br>
Historic Preservation Act to take historic resources into account in their programs and activities.<br>
<br>
Effects of Federal Involvement<br>
<br>
These programs represent a broadening, if not deepening commitment on behalf of the federal<br>
government, to create effective and meaningful stewardship of federally-owned historic property,<br>
as well as conscientious use of federal funds that affect historic resources. <br>
<br>
State Government Influence<br>
<br>
State government support for historic preservation has increased as federal support has<br>
declined. In July 1994, Governor Zell Miller elevated the Historic Preservation Section to<br>
Division status within the Department of Natural Resources. Along with this rise in position in<br>
state government, the Governor recommended and the General Assembly enacted the Heritage<br>
2000 grant program. $270,000 was made available in the form of grants in state fiscal year (SFY)<br>
1996. These grants are designed to provide funds to Georgia communities to rehabilitate their<br>
historic properties. <br>
<br>
State funding continues to support the Regional Historic Preservation Planning Program within 13<br>
of the state's 17 Regional Development Centers, with an allocation of $243,000 for SFY 1996. <br>
An annual $25,000 allocation is provided to the Division for inventory of historic resources. In<br>
addition, State monies are used to support the Georgia Main Street Program, housed in the<br>
Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism. State funds also allow the Historic Preservation<br>
Division to contract with the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation to carry out the Main Street<br>
Design Assistance Program throughout Georgia. The University of Georgia also receives an<br>
allocation through HPD to provide preservation assistance to local governments through the<br>
Office of Preservation Services. In 1993, the Historic Preservation Division completed a<br>
inventory of all State-owned historic resources as a precursor to future development of a<br>
comprehensive State-owned historic building stewardship program.<br>
<br>
The Department of Community Affairs (DCA) has also assisted communities with numerous<br>
preservation projects through its Local Development Fund, the administration of the Community<br>
Development Block Grant program to non-entitlement communities, and special appropriations.<br>
<br>
In 1989, the General Assembly passed legislation to create an ad valorem tax freeze for owners<br>
rehabilitating historic residential and commercial property. Also in 1989, the State passed the<br>
Georgia Planning Act, mandating that all Georgia communities prepare a comprehensive plan,<br>
including a section acknowledging and planning for the future of historic resources. <br>
<br>
Additional legislation passed by the General Assembly includes the Georgia Environmental Policy<br>
Act of 1991 (GEPA), requiring that historic resources be taken into account for State funded<br>
projects. In 1995, Georgia passed legislation to allow for Judicial In Rem Tax Foreclosure,<br>
facilitating the process by which local governments and nonprofit entities can take tax delinquent<br>
property and make it available for affordable housing and neighborhood redevelopment.<br>
<br>
The Georgia Civil War Commission and the Georgia State Capitol Commission were created by<br>
the General Assembly in 1993, to oversee and promote the preservation of these important and<br>
unique historic resources. In 1995, the Legislature created by resolution the Georgia Future<br>
Communities Commission to examine and make recommendations concerning the governmental,<br>
social, and economic issues confronting local governments.<br>
<br>
Effects of State Involvement<br>
<br>
State initiatives are creating a heightened awareness of the importance of historic resources and<br>
the active preservation of them. New State preservation commissions will generate increased<br>
attention to certain historic resources, as well as a need for close coordination among preservation<br>
partners. Downsizing of government, however, will cause all State agencies, including the<br>
Historic Preservation Division, to re-evaluate priorities and provide services in new ways.<br>
<br>
Transportation Trends<br>
<br>
Georgia is a state that is highly dependent upon its system of interstate highways, expressways,<br>
arterials and collector roads. The Georgia Department of Transportation has aggressively<br>
invested in construction of new roads and bridges, maintenance, rehabilitation and restoration<br>
programs. The road network includes 110,000 miles of public roads, with 18,000 miles classified<br>
as a part of the State Highway System. With the construction of new highways and the expansion<br>
of existing ones, the growth of the state transportation system will have a significant effect on the<br>
historic resources of Georgia.<br>
<br>
Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act<br>
<br>
The passage of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) by Congress in<br>
1991 signaled the end of the Interstate era and the beginning of a new approach to transportation<br>
programs. ISTEA set out a new national transportation policy, shifting program emphasis from a<br>
single focus of building highways and bridges, to the creation and management of an integrated,<br>
multimodal transportation network. <br>
<br>
Implementation of this new policy and the eligibility for federal funding is based on compliance<br>
with new planning requirements that include public involvement and an emphasis on local needs to<br>
formulate a Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP, a three-year action plan) and<br>
the Statewide Transportation Plan (a twenty-year policy document identifying projects for the<br>
STIP). In response to these requirements the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT)<br>
created the Transportation 2000 Commission, a broad coalition of interested parties, which<br>
developed a new statewide transportation plan. In surveys conducted as part of the Commission's<br>
planning process, 97% of those polled agreed that public involvement in transportation program<br>
decisions should be a continuous process and 83% felt that we must resolve or prevent the<br>
harmful effects of transportation on the natural and built environment. <br>
<br>
The new federal transportation act is having several effects on the preservation of Georgia's<br>
historic resources. The flexible funding provisions of ISTEA allow states to spend money not<br>
only on highways, but on mass transit and commuter rail systems. The Act also requires Georgia<br>
to spend at least 10% of its allocated surface transportation funds on enhancement activities<br>
which can include acquisition and rehabilitation of historic property, preservation and alternative<br>
use of abandoned railway corridors, and acquisition of easements on scenic areas or historic sites. <br>
State transportation plans must include other public policy concerns, and allow for flexible design<br>
standards for projects that affect areas of historic or scenic value.<br>
<br>
Roads and Bridges <br>
<br>
The expansion and maintenance of Georgia's system of highways and bridges continues to be the<br>
single most important element of Georgia's intermodal transportation system. The Georgia DOT's<br>
Developmental Highway System results in the widening of two-lane rural routes to four lanes and<br>
the continuation of these routes into and through many small communities. The proposed Outer<br>
Perimeter around Atlanta would affect fully one-fourth of the state through impacts to traffic, land<br>
use, air and water quality, and community economies. These &quot;improvements&quot; may encourage<br>
sprawl and occur at the expense of archeological resources, rural historic resources, historic<br>
bridges, downtown buildings or the loss of the small town, pedestrian character of communities in<br>
their path. On the other hand, improved roads sometimes allow the communities affected to<br>
recruit new industrial and commercial development and assist tourists and other motorists to more<br>
easily visit their shops and historic places. <br>
<br>
Approximately 1300 bridges still in operation on the public road system in Georgia were built<br>
prior to 1940. Many of the bridges considered eligible for the National Register of Historic<br>
Places have been determined &quot;functionally obsolete,&quot; not meeting current design and safety<br>
standards. These bridges require widening or reconstruction which can result in loss of historic<br>
character.<br>
<br>
It is important that as part of the ISTEA planning process and Section 106 review, communities<br>
make their concerns and objectives known, insuring that the designs for new or widened roads<br>
and replacement bridges take into account issues of historic resources and quality of life.<br>
<br>
Intermodal Transportation<br>
<br>
Public transportation is currently available to nearly 4 million Georgians (67% of the population),<br>
but the majority of use is concentrated in the urban and suburban areas. Survey results from the<br>
Transportation 2000 process show that 75% of those questioned would like to see improvements<br>
in the state's public transit systems. The further development of a statewide intermodal public<br>
transportation system including commuter rail, buses, and rail passenger service can minimize<br>
environmental concerns, reduce sprawl, and serve as an economic development tool. This<br>
approach could reduce the adverse impact of roads on historic resources as well as improve<br>
access to historic communities. <br>
<br>
Railroads<br>
<br>
According to the Georgia Transportation 2000 Commission, people throughout the state<br>
expressed overwhelming support for all types of rail improvements. Results of the GDOT survey<br>
indicate that 81% questioned would like to see improvements to passenger and commuter rail<br>
facilities and over 80% would be willing to pay increased fees, tolls or fares to support the cost of<br>
such improvements. <br>
Rail corridor preservation is another element of the rail improvement program. Preservation of<br>
abandoned rail corridors is critical to protect the rights of way, bridges and depots for future<br>
transportation use, and in the short term they can be utilized for walking paths, bike trails or<br>
greenways. Most of Georgia's rail corridors are historic as significant engineered structures. <br>
Many rail corridors include other historic buildings and structures, such as depots and water<br>
towers. The value of rail corridor protection is especially important in urban areas where the<br>
pressure to develop these areas is most acute. As rail lines continue to be abandoned by the<br>
railroads, and commuter rail perhaps becomes a reality in Georgia, more attention needs to be<br>
paid by the railroads to the preservation of these significant historic resources. <br>
<br>
Airports and Port Facilities<br>
<br>
As Georgia grows, the need for new or expanded ports and airports will also grow. The<br>
construction of new airports and port facilities and expansion of existing ones can have an adverse<br>
effect on historic resources. Construction can affect historic buildings and archeological sites in<br>
the impacted area. Dredging for port access along the coast can destroy underwater archeological<br>
resources or alter currents, leading to coastal erosion. The creation of new airport facilities can<br>
create increased noise and air pollution and an increase in local traffic. When planning these types<br>
of facilities, it is important to look at the possible effects on historic resources early in the<br>
planning process in order to minimize or mitigate them. <br>
<br>
Transportation 2000 Goals<br>
<br>
The goals that emerged from the Transportation 2000 process provide a clear indication of the<br>
attitudes of Georgians toward transportation and historic preservation. These goals include:<br>
preserving the unique character of Georgia's developing small cities and rural areas; supporting a<br>
demonstration program that integrates transportation planning into the community planning<br>
process; providing transportation design that is integrated with architectural and planning design;<br>
providing for the rehabilitation and adaptive use of existing historic buildings and structures; and<br>
encouraging community planning that recognizes the uniqueness and diversity of Georgia's cities<br>
and neighborhoods. <br>
<br>
Effects of Transportation Trends<br>
<br>
Evolving public attitudes, new federal legislation, the development of comprehensive plans in<br>
accordance with the Georgia Planning Act, increasing interest in preservation of historic places<br>
and community character, and increasing public participation in transportation policy will<br>
eventually bring about change in the planning and design of Georgia's transportation system.<br>
<br>
Tourism Trends<br>
<br>
Tourism in Georgia is very big business. After agriculture, tourism ranks as the second largest<br>
industry in the state. The Georgia Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism estimates that in<br>
1994, 39.47 million visitors came to Georgia, spending $12.3 billion, a 25% increase in tourist<br>
expenditures since 1989. The resultant impact of this wave of tourism is 387,659 jobs statewide, <br>
$1.13 billion in State government revenue and $658 million in revenue to local governments. <br>
Much of this tourist activity takes place in Georgia's historic downtowns, at historic sites, or in<br>
historic rural areas, bringing both the opportunity to educate visitors about our historic resources,<br>
and to raise concern over the continued welfare of these resources.<br>
<br>
With the Olympic Games in Atlanta in the summer of 1996, the city and state will be propelled<br>
onto the international stage, with residual effects that could last for years to come. The last<br>
Olympic city, Barcelona, experienced a 43% increase in tourism the year after the games. The<br>
exposure of the Olympics will help to illustrate the diversity of Georgia. The promotion of and<br>
visitation to historic districts and sites will play a major role in visitors' experience of the state. <br>
<br>
Tourism studies show that the profile of the typical tourist is changing. People today take several<br>
short vacations and weekend trips rather than one long vacation each year. They tend to visit<br>
places closer to home. Growing segments of the tourism market are retired people and<br>
professionals with considerable disposable incomes. The African-American tourism market is also<br>
growing rapidly in Georgia.<br>
<br>
Travelers are becoming more interested in looking for experiences off the interstate highways,<br>
traveling on two and four lane secondary roads. Taking advantage of this interest, communities<br>
have worked together to promote a critical mass of attractions such as the Antebellum Trail<br>
through central Georgia. By marketing historic districts, house museums, and landscapes, along<br>
with other attractions, communities can enhance their appeal to tourists. For this to happen,<br>
however, the historic resources must exist, be in good physical shape, be accessible to the public,<br>
and be interpreted accurately. <br>
<br>
For an effective statewide heritage tourism strategy, Georgia must develop better regional and<br>
state heritage tourism marketing strategies, and also improve its &quot;resource base&quot; (i.e. buildings,<br>
sites, etc.). There must be something there and worthwhile for tourism professionals to market. <br>
<br>
Historic properties already play a large role in the tourism economies of Savannah, Atlanta,<br>
coastal Georgia, Macon, Augusta, Columbus and the Georgia mountains. In addition, many<br>
smaller communities in Georgia are capitalizing on their historic appeal and Main Street affiliation,<br>
providing a quality experience for the traveler. <br>
<br>
There has recently been an increase in visitation of sites important to African-American history. <br>
Communities such as Savannah, Augusta, Macon and Atlanta have created walking and driving<br>
tours of historic African-American sites, helping to interpret this important aspect of Georgia's<br>
history. American Indian sites, such as New Echota and Etowah Mounds, continue to attract<br>
tourists. The Department of Natural Resources has taken the lead in managing and interpreting<br>
these sites as part of the state parks and historic sites system.<br>
<br>
Other popular tourist destinations in Georgia are the state's Civil War battlefields and sites. The<br>
National Park Service manages several of these sites such as Andersonville National Historic Site,<br>
Chickamauga National Military Park and Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park. State<br>
and local governments in Georgia are active in preserving, protecting and marketing some lesser<br>
known Civil War sites. Bringing the tourism potential of these sites to fruition can have a<br>
significant effect on local economies. The challenge is to be able to capitalize on these resources,<br>
while at the same time preserving and protecting the sites, vistas and open space that accurately<br>
convey the historic experience.<br>
<br>
Effects of Tourism Trends<br>
<br>
The preservation and promotion of historic sites, &quot;heritage tourism,&quot; is a major component of<br>
tourism activity in Georgia. Up to 38% of visitors surveyed at Georgia Welcome Centers planned<br>
to visit historic or cultural sites during their stay. This percentage would grow significantly if<br>
Georgia were marketed more aggressively as a place to experience history. Currently, only a few<br>
areas are marketed that way, and heritage tourism is a much larger part of those areas' tourism<br>
industry. The popularity of heritage tourism can have a positive effect on the preservation of<br>
historic districts and sites by bringing economic benefits to their communities. In addition, the<br>
attention can raise awareness among local citizens to the importance of the long-term preservation<br>
of their historic resources. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, heavy visitation to a historic site can result in deterioration if not carefully<br>
managed. Wear and tear, parking, insensitive adjacent development and inappropriate<br>
maintenance and repair can have detrimental effects on the integrity of historic property. As<br>
heritage tourism grows, it will become increasingly important for managers of historic sites and<br>
areas to be educated in the appropriate preservation techniques and methods necessary to<br>
maintain, interpret and protect these fragile resources. <br>
<br>
Historic Preservation Trends<br>
<br>
Historic preservation as a profession has broadened its scope in recent years and become more<br>
accepted as a discipline. This has led to the acceptance of professional and technical standards as<br>
well as the use of more sophisticated tools to accomplish preservation goals. <br>
<br>
Education<br>
<br>
Four universities and colleges in Georgia currently offer advanced degree programs in the<br>
preservation field. Historic preservation degrees are offered by Armstrong State College,<br>
Georgia State University, The Savannah College of Art and Design, and the University of<br>
Georgia. Formal training in the documentation, evaluation and protection of historic places can<br>
only increase the effectiveness of preservation programs and projects. Graduates of these<br>
educational programs have helped to raise the level of professional expertise in preservation and<br>
have brought an awareness of the preservation ethic to other fields such as architecture, landscape<br>
architecture, planning, archeology, anthropology, law, and real estate development. More<br>
information about preservation needs to be provided to students pursuing degrees in these and<br>
other fields.<br>
<br>
Even with the commitment by the higher education institutions in the state to the preservation<br>
field, much more education and training needs to be done. Public officials, especially local and<br>
State representatives need to be better informed about the benefits of historic preservation to their<br>
communities and the state. Workshops explaining historic preservation and its potential benefits<br>
need to be made available to developers, planners, government leaders, architects, and other<br>
professionals affecting historic resources. Owners of historic buildings and archeological sites<br>
need to be educated as to the importance of these places and the appropriate techniques to insure<br>
their preservation. <br>
<br>
Most importantly, historic preservation needs to be taught on a widespread basis to school<br>
children throughout the state. Heritage education should include an awareness of historic<br>
buildings, districts and archeological sites as a tangible link to the history of the community, state<br>
and nation. The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation has sought to assist K through 12<br>
teachers in making better use of their community's historic and cultural resources as a regular part<br>
of the school curriculum. <br>
<br>
Those individuals involved directly in preservation projects such as contractors, craftspeople,<br>
architects and designers need to know not only the skills of their profession, but the overall goals<br>
of a restoration or rehabilitation project and to understand more about the philosophy that<br>
underlies decisions. <br>
<br>
Information about current preservation techniques, materials and methods need to be available to<br>
those individuals making decisions about and directly affecting historic property. <br>
<br>
Technology<br>
<br>
Recent technological advances have also made archeological investigation less expensive and<br>
more accurate. Remote sensing devices have dropped in price and become more powerful,<br>
allowing investigators to locate and map sites without ground disturbance. Unfortunately, the<br>
widespread availability of this type of sophisticated equipment allows looters to locate and<br>
damage these sites as well. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is also being used much more<br>
frequently to assist with rehabilitation decisions for historic buildings and districts.<br>
<br>
The use of sophisticated mapping techniques such as Geographic Information Systems and Global<br>
Positioning Systems is assisting preservationists with architectural and archeological surveys. <br>
This helps local planning agencies take historic sites into consideration when making land use<br>
decisions. GIS is perhaps the single most important technological improvement revolutionizing<br>
how survey data is stored, manipulated, and made available to others. GIS can speed up decision<br>
making, especially in planning and in Section 106 review, more than any other program<br>
improvement. Historic resource data is, unfortunately, not yet available in GIS format in Georgia<br>
except in a few regional or local planning agencies. <br>
<br>
Current technology can also be used as an effective means of public education. Videotapes and<br>
interactive video conferencing can be low-cost alternatives to visiting individuals and communities<br>
in a state as large and diverse as Georgia. Use of the Internet, the Worldwide Web, image<br>
processing, and other relatively new technologies is just beginning to be used in the preservation<br>
field, but will certainly increase and revolutionize how preservation communication, training and<br>
assistance is done.<br>
<br>
Computer technology is being increasingly used as an information management tool for historic<br>
resource survey data, as well as tracking programs and review projects within state and federal<br>
offices. <br>
<br>
Partnerships<br>
<br>
For preservation to be most effective, there must be a link between the private, public and<br>
nonprofit sectors working toward common preservation goals. Groups such as local historical<br>
societies, museums and preservation commissions need to work closely with the Historic<br>
Preservation Division, the university preservation programs, and statewide organizations like the<br>
Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation, and on the national level with the National Park Service<br>
and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In addition, these organizations need to find<br>
common ground with organizations that advocate similar goals such as the Trust for Public Land,<br>
the Georgia Conservancy, the Georgia Municipal Association, the Society for Georgia<br>
Archeology, and others.<br>
<br>
Preservationists need to continue to bring their message to nontraditional forums that affect<br>
historic resources. Bankers, state and local officials and planners, educators, realtors and<br>
developers should continue to be informed about the uses and benefits of historic preservation.<br>
<br>
Conclusions<br>
<br>
Georgia is evolving into a very different place than it was fifty, or even twenty, years ago. <br>
Preservation will be more difficult in the future in the face of such change. Yet Georgians will<br>
become more ardent supporters of preservation as a means of retaining the best of our past as we<br>
shape a new future.<br>
<br>
With the rapid increase in population in some areas of the state, preservationists need to<br>
emphasize the education of new residents as well as decision makers to the economic benefits of<br>
preservation and to its use as an effective tool for growth management.<br>
<br>
In areas of little growth, information needs to be distributed that explains how historic resources<br>
can help stimulate economic development through the use of existing infrastructure, downtown<br>
revitalization and the potential for tourism. <br>
<br>
Preservation will be enhanced by the use of new technologies. Computer technology can<br>
accelerate the documentation, identification and location of historic resources, as well as<br>
information management. Public awareness of historic preservation and heritage education can be<br>
enhanced by using new methods of interactive communication.<br>
<br>
<br>
With improved and greater amounts of information about the significance and location of historic<br>
resources, communities can be better informed and take historic places into account when<br>
planning for future growth and land use. New and better development models need to be created<br>
for communities, which emphasize sustainability and reuse of existing historic resources and<br>
infrastructure. Preservation is an important tool that can help citizens and agencies identify and<br>
preserve those aspects of their communities important to their quality of life.<br>
<br>
Preservationists, whether working on the local, regional, state or national level cannot succeed<br>
without assistance from diverse groups and individuals with similar, interconnected goals. <br>
Establishing partnerships and relationships with like-minded organizations will strengthen the<br>
effectiveness of historic preservation, increase its constituency, and continue to solidify its<br>
widespread use and acceptance. <br>

<p>CHAPTER FOUR </p>
<p><font size=5><strong>Historic Preservation and How It Works</strong></font> </p>
<hr>
<p>Historic preservation is the process of identifying places, sites and resources that have survived from our past; evaluating the 
meaning and value they have for us now; and keeping, using and caring for those significant places, sites and resources so they 
will survive into the future. The preamble of the National Historic Preservation Act, passed by Congress in 1966, best 
expresses the value of historic preservation: &quot;The spirit and direction of the nation are founded upon and reflected in its historic 
heritage; the historical and cultural foundations of the nation should be preserved as a living part of our community life and 
development in order to give a sense of orientation to the American people.&quot; </p>
<p>The preservation process is accomplished in a variety of ways. It may involve survey, evaluation and designation, legal 
protection, planning, archeological research and investigation, rehabilitation, interpretation, acquisition and/or adaptive reuse. </p>
<p>There is a growing desire to preserve Georgia's heritage and historic places as the state continues to change. The preservation 
constituency includes historic property owners and activists, planners and developers, elected officials and professionals, 
African-Americans and American Indians, archeologists and architects, Civil War enthusiasts and Civil Rights activists, 
non-profit organizations and government agencies, academic institutions, environmentalists and downtown business owners, 
farmers and suburban dwellers, open space advocates and economic development specialists, children in classrooms and 
graduate students, the poor in need of housing and museum curators interpreting our history. They support historic 
preservation for different reasons; they see its value from different perspectives. Yet they are all preservationists. </p>
<p>Preservation is no longer just one thing, it is an ever-widening sphere of influence. It includes tourism, economic development, 
open space protection, heritage education, rehabilitation of historic buildings, community conservation, affordable housing, 
neotraditional planning, sustainable development, downtown revitalization, cultural celebration, archeology, design and 
craftsmanship. The challenge for the Historic Preservation Division is to meet the needs and provide services to a diverse 
constituency at a time when the demand for preservation is growing, historic places are disappearing, and the resources to 
meet demands are shrinking. The answer to this challenge lies in strategic planning and forming new partnerships. In the new 
century, preservation will be done by non-preservationists who incorporate the protection and use of historic resources into 
their own goals and activities. </p>
<p>Georgia boasts a strong and well-organized historic preservation network. Preservation of historic places began at the local 
level and continues to occur primarily at the local level through the commitment and actions of local people and organizations. 
Support, training, technical assistance, funding and direction are provided at the state level, with reliance on the federal 
infrastructure of laws, guidelines, criteria and funding. The decision to preserve historic resources is usually made at the local 
level, either by property owners, preservation activists, local organizations, or local government. People at the local level then 
call on statewide agencies, universities, or organizations for help, or they use funds, incentives, or programs offered at the state 
level. Projects are carried out according to federal standards, often using federal dollars or incentives, or relying on federal 
laws and regulations. </p>
<p>Partnerships between different groups --each with unique abilities and resources--have been at the foundation of the 
preservation movement. Such partnerships will be even more important as we move toward the new century. It will not be 
possible for one organization, one level of government, or one group of people to fully represent all of the increasingly 
complex interests in preservation. Each group and organization will find it possible to accomplish their own preservation goals 
only by working in partnership with others. </p>
<p>Preservation at the Local Level </p>
<p>Historic preservation at the local level takes many forms. It ranges from individual preservation of a local landmark, such as a 
county courthouse, to the revitalization of a historic neighborhood or downtown. It could take the form of a preservation 
component in a comprehensive plan or the passage by city council of a historic preservation ordinance and the appointment of 
a preservation commission. All these activities are initiated within the local community, but can be encouraged and assisted by 
regional and state organizations. </p>
<p>Local Historic Preservation Planning </p>
<p>With the passage of the Georgia Planning Act of 1989, communities all over the state have had the opportunity to examine 
where they are, evaluate what they have, and determine where they want to go. The identification and evaluation of historic 
resources is a required component of this planning process. By integrating historic preservation into the overall comprehensive 
planning process, local governments are being asked to consider the relationship between preservation and other aspects of 
community life. Historic preservation should be considered as communities plan for economic development, determine future 
land use, formulate a housing strategy or plan transportation improvements. </p>
<p>The basis of any preservation planning process should be an inventory and evaluation of existing historic resources (see 
Appendix A). From information gathered from comprehensive plans submitted for State review from around Georgia, it is 
evident that some communities do not have adequate inventories on which to base their evaluation. Although a &quot;windshield 
survey&quot; may be a helpful first step in gaining a broad, general impression of what and where a community's historic resources 
are, a detailed survey is needed for serious planning and preservation efforts. The Historic Preservation Division provides 
funding for comprehensive, standardized surveys. Unfortunately, since 1988 only about 24% of the state has been surveyed 
using this program due to the small amount of funds available. A recent analysis of comprehensive plans concluded that almost 
40% do not contain an adequate inventory of existing historic resources. Without a good inventory as a basis for evaluation it 
is difficult for communities to arrive at meaningful goals and implementation strategies relating to their historic resources. Given 
the low funding level available to the Division for historic resource surveys, local governments and preservation organizations 
need to find additional sources of funds for this activity which is the foundation of all preservation efforts. </p>
<p>Analysis of the historic resources component of comprehensive plans revealed that communities with Main Street programs, 
Certified Local Governments, and those that relied on a historic preservation planner at the Regional Development Center 
produced the best historic resource sections of comprehensive plans. This suggests that when trained preservation 
professionals or volunteers are active at the local level, historic resources receive more serious consideration. </p>
<p>Local Historic Preservation Commissions </p>
<p>The number of historic preservation commissions has increased rapidly over the past twenty years. In 1976 there were 492 
historic preservation commissions across the country. By 1993, that number had increased to 1,863. From 1981 to 1992 the 
number of commissions grew by over 200%. The majority of these commissions represent small and mid-sized communities. 
Nationwide, 64% of local preservation commissions function in communities of less than 50,000, and of these, one-third have 
populations under 10,000. The number of commissions in small towns continues to grow. </p>
<p>In Georgia the increase is even more dramatic. Georgia had only seven historic preservation commissions in 1976, but by 
1995 the number had grown to 74, following the passage of the Georgia Historic Preservation Act of 1980. From 1981 
through 1994, the number of commissions grew almost 500%. Along with this phenomenal growth has come increased need 
for training, information and funding. Nationwide and in Georgia, 87% of local preservation commissions receive technical 
assistance and information from the State Historic Preservation Office. </p>
<p>Whatever the motivation, communities are adopting preservation ordinances in Georgia at the rate of about 8 per year. People 
living in historic areas in Georgia are seeking and implementing this type of local regulation and protection. </p>
<p>A 1992 study by the Athens Observer illustrates one of the reasons why communities and neighborhoods are opting for local 
designation. The study looked at the average increase in fair market value for 15 streets or neighborhoods in Athens from 
1986 through 1992. Four of the 15 were in locally designated historic districts, while the other eleven were not. Research 
showed that in the eleven non-designated areas, property values increased by about 30%, but in the four designated historic 
areas the value jumped 130%. A similar study in Macon also found that property values increased significantly more in 
neighborhoods designated as local historic districts than in comparable non-designated neighborhoods. </p>
<p>In addition to enhancing property values, local historic district designation can help attract private investment to downtown 
areas, improve the livability of residential neighborhoods, utilize existing infrastructure, and empower local residents to help 
make decisions about how their community will change and grow. </p>
<p>Certified Local Governments </p>
<p>In 1995, 44 Georgia communities participated in the Certified Local Government (CLG) Program. These communities have 
chosen to enter into a &quot;preservation partnership&quot; with the Historic Preservation Division and the National Park Service. By 
passing a historic preservation ordinance and establishing a local commission that complies with the Georgia Historic 
Preservation Act, these communities have made a commitment to actively protect their historic resources. This partnership 
establishes a relationship between the local government and the state and federal agencies providing historic preservation 
services. CLGs benefit by receiving technical assistance and they are eligible for federal grant funds from the Historic 
Preservation Division. </p>
<p>CLG participation as a percentage of total preservation commissions is significantly higher in Georgia than the national 
average. In Georgia almost 60% of commissions are CLGs while nationwide only 48% of commissions are. </p>
<p>Other Local Preservation Efforts </p>
<p>Non-profit preservation organizations lead local preservation efforts in all of Georgia's major cities. Their functions and 
services vary from one town to another, but all are leaders in advocating for preservation. Main Street programs that promote 
downtown revitalization through economic restructuring, organization, design and preservation, and promotion are bringing 
historic downtowns back to life in 35 cities. Local heritage museums house archival collections and genealogical resources, 
and present exhibits on local history and culture. Countless individuals become active in local issues to protect historic 
resources. Owners of historic property continue to protect and rehabilitate their historic properties, sometimes without even 
realizing that they are the backbone of the historic preservation movement. </p>
<p>Needs at the Local Level </p>
<p>The most requested assistance from the local level is funding for the preservation of specific structures within communities. 
Rehabilitation projects can be expensive, and local governments and non-profit organizations often do not have the means to 
carry out these projects without help. In addition, communities and individuals need technical assistance on current 
preservation techniques, materials and design. </p>
<p>Local governments need more funding to undertake and update comprehensive historic resource surveys to better understand 
their historic resources and how to plan for their future. Historic resource inventories can also serve to educate the community 
and local officials about the location and significance of historic places. </p>
<p>Communities also want assistance with enactment of historic preservation ordinances and creation of historic preservation 
commissions. Those communities that already have commissions are in need of more training for commission members. In a 
recent National Alliance of Preservation Commissions survey, 35% of Georgia's commissions stated that they have had no 
training in the last two years. Few commissions have funds to send their members to training; of the commissions responding, 
79% said they have no budget at all. Local and State officials also need education in the economic, aesthetic and legal aspects 
of historic preservation. </p>
<p>Local governments and commissions need more and flexible tools to implement historic preservation programs. For example, 
many communities outside of Georgia have enacted &quot;Conservation Districts&quot; that allow communities to shape change in areas 
that are special assets but that do not yet qualify as historic. Financial incentives tied to local designation or a tax credit for 
residential rehabilitation would act to stimulate the preservation of resources. </p>
<p>Regional Historic Preservation </p>
<p>Many historic preservation activities span municipal boundaries. Local governments must often work together on a regional 
level to accomplish their preservation goals. In addition, especially in rural areas of the state, local expertise on historic 
preservation is not available. Georgia has in place a network of Regional Development Centers (RDCs) which provide 
planning assistance throughout the state. Since 1978, Regional Preservation Planners have been on staff at most of the RDCs 
to assist local governments, groups and individuals with historic preservation activities. Currently, fourteen of the seventeen 
RDCs employ a Regional Preservation Planner. </p>
<p>This program has been extremely effective in bringing the programs of the Historic Preservation Division and other 
preservation related activities to regional and local constituents. With the passage of the Georgia Planning Act of 1989, the 
state has mandated that all communities create a comprehensive plan. Since RDCs produce many of these plans, the Regional 
Preservation Planners have had the opportunity to integrate the preservation of historic resources into the planning process. </p>
<p>The size of Georgia and the large and growing number of requests for assistance make it virtually impossible for the Historic 
Preservation Division to provide all the assistance, visit all the projects, prepare all the plans, and respond to all the requests 
for help in Georgia. Support for continuation and expansion to all areas of the state of the Regional Preservation Planning 
Program is essential for the future of preservation. </p>
<p>Statewide Preservation Network </p>
<p>One of the hallmarks of preservation in Georgia is the strong statewide network and coordination among the various 
preservation interests throughout the state. Georgia is recognized nationally for the strength, size and accomplishments of its 
many preservation organizations, including the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation, the Historic Preservation Division, the 
Georgia Alliance of Preservation Commissions, Georgians for Preservation Action, UGA's Office of Preservation Services, 
the Georgia Civil War Commission, the African-American Historic Preservation Network, the Society for Georgia 
Archeology, and the four colleges and universities that offer degrees in historic preservation, among others. With so many 
preservation leaders in Georgia's preservation movement, the challenge becomes coordinating efforts so that all preservation 
organizations communicate one preservation message, avoid duplicating services or activities, and work toward shared goals. </p>
<p>Public funding for preservation activities and projects is provided primarily by the Historic Preservation Division. The Division 
passes a large portion of its state and federal appropriations through to state and local government agencies, non-profit 
organizations, and others in the form of grants and contracts for projects. The Georgia Civil War Commission assists with 
funding for battlefield acquisition and other preservation projects related to Civil War resources. </p>
<p>The majority of preservation services are provided by the Historic Preservation Division, the Georgia Trust, and the Office of 
Preservation Services at the University of Georgia, with much help and cooperation from many others. The Historic 
Preservation Division provides a full range of services, including survey, National and Georgia Register of Historic Places 
nominations, planning assistance, environmental review, funding, information and education services, tax incentives, 
architectural technical assistance, archeology technical assistance, training, advocacy, assistance with local government 
preservation activities and ordinances. The Georgia Trust administers house museums and offers services ranging from 
heritage education, Main Street design assistance, and a statewide revolving fund, to advocacy, scholarships and awards, and 
information and education. The Office of Preservation Services provides hands-on assistance and training to local 
governments, information and education services, community planning and design assistance, and advocacy. Many other 
agencies and organizations provide additional preservation assistance and services. </p>
<p>Advocacy on preservation issues is coordinated by Georgians for Preservation Action and the Georgia Trust. Georgians for 
Preservation Action (GaPA) is a grassroots alliance coordinated by the Georgia Trust that brings together all of the major 
preservation groups, all regions of the state, and diverse perspectives to develop a coordinated approach for advocating the 
protection of historic places and support for preservation programs and funding in Georgia and at the national level. The 
Georgia Trust effectively represents its 9,300 members through advocacy activities at the local, state and national levels. </p>
<p>Historic preservation policy of the State of Georgia is carried out primarily by the Historic Preservation Division. The Division 
implements or monitors laws and regulations pertaining to historic resources, proposes or comments on new legislation that 
would promote preservation goals, prepares the historic preservation plan for Georgia, and provides advice on preservation 
policy to the Governor, the Commissioner of Natural Resources, and other agencies. The Division carries out its duties and 
administers its programs uder legislative authority of federal and state law. </p>
<p>Georgia is fortunate to have so many strong and successful statewide preservation leaders. As the preservation constituency 
continues to broaden; as preservation issues become more complex; as the emphasis for preservation continues to shift to the 
local level; as funding and programs that support preservation shrink; and as change continues to transform Georgia, statewide 
organizations and agencies must double their efforts to coordinate and support one another to provide the most effective 
preservation program possible. </p>
<p>Federal and National Preservation Support </p>
<p>The federal government provides the foundation upon which many local and state historic preservation activities are built. The 
National Historic Preservation Act, passed in 1966 and amended in 1980 and 1992, defined national policy on historic 
preservation, established the National Register of Historic Places, created the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and 
created the system of State Historic Preservation Offices through which preservation funds and services are provided. 
Sections 106 and 110 of the Act establish the responsibility of all federal agencies to inventory, designate, and protect historic 
properties which they own, and to take historic resources into account in federally funded, licensed and permitted activities. </p>
<p>The National Park Service (NPS) administers the Historic Preservation Fund, from which annual appropriations are made to 
support the mandated activities of State Historic Preservation Offices. The NPS also administers the National Register of 
Historic Places, and many other programs and activities essential to preservation. The National Register criteria and the 
Secretary of the Interior's Standards have become the benchmarks by which historic resources and preservation activities are 
measured. The NPS also develops preservation technical information and distributes it nationwide. </p>
<p>The National Trust for Historic Preservation is the national non-profit historic preservation organization that was chartered by 
Congress in 1949. The National Trust operates house museums, provides funding for preservation projects, advocates for 
preservation, provides information, provides membership services, and works in cooperation with state and local 
organizations to help preserve historic places. Its regional offices are especially helpful in providing technical assistance and 
funding for preservation projects. </p>
<p>Other national organizations, including the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, Preservation Action, 
the Society for American Archeology, and many more, work to promote the preservation and protection of historic places. </p>
<p>Conclusion </p>
<p>The historic preservation network is growing. As the network grows, it becomes more complex, with more issues to cover 
and more points of view to consider. Yet this network of organizations, agencies, and individuals has developed into an 
effective and committed movement working to shape the future of communities in Georgia and throughout the nation. </p>

<p>CHAPTER FIVE </p>
<p><font size=5><strong>Goals and Objectives for Preservation</strong></font> </p>
<hr>
<p>A plan is useful only if it is put into action. A vision of a better future is only a dream unless it is accompanied by ongoing 
commitment, strategic focus, and hard work to turn the vision into reality. Therefore the heart of The Preservation Plan for 
Georgia's Heritage is this set of goals and objectives that are designed to guide the Historic Preservation Division in doing its 
part to bring the collective vision for preservation into reality. Many other preservation partners must plan their own set of 
actions in order for the goals for preservation to be fully realized. Some suggestions for these actions are contained in Chapter 
6, A Call to Action. The objectives and planned actions in this chapter are those of the Historic Preservation Division. </p>

<p>CHAPTER SIX </p>
<p><font size=5><strong>A Call for Action </strong></font></p>
<hr>
<p>The preservation of Georgia's historic resources cannot be accomplished by the Historic Preservation Division alone. The 
Division's mission is to promote the preservation and use of Georgia's historic places for a better Georgia. This plan is 
designed to guide the Division in carrying out its mission. Other purposes of the statewide preservation plan include providing 
information about historic resources and preservation to a new audience, and identifying the role others in the preservation 
network play in bringing the preservation vision into reality. Historic preservation organizations, state and community leaders, 
property owners, and preservation volunteers and supporters must develop their own plans for the future. However, these 
plans can be most effective if they are coordinated. The vision and goals in this plan are representative of the views of 
preservationists across Georgia. The vision and goals can become a point of consensus among organizations with different 
missions but similar interests. </p>
<p>This chapter does not attempt to tell others what to do; rather, it points out actions that others can take to address the 
important preservation issues in Georgia's future. </p>
<p>National Action Needed </p>
<p>Goal 1: Achieve widespread public awareness and involvement in historic preservation in Georgia. </p>
<p>Federal agencies and national non-profit preservation organizations must continue to improve information dissemination and 
outreach activities, including use of mass media and new technology to broaden the awareness and support for preservation. </p>
<p>Goal 2: Gather information about all historic resources in Georgia, and make the information accessible for planning, advocacy 
and educational purposes. </p>
<p>Continue federal funding for surveys and National Register nominations. </p>
<p>Assist with the development of Geographic Information Systems and other technological advances to share historic resource 
data. </p>
<p>Continue to develop heritage education curricula using National Register information. </p>
<p>Goal 3: Secure financial and legal tools sufficient to preserve the significant historic resources in Georgia. </p>
<p>Continue appropriations from the Historic Preservation Fund that provide the basic framework for many preservation 
activities using a highly effective public-private and federal-state-local partnership to deliver preservation services. </p>
<p>Enact legislation that would provide financial incentives for the preservation of historic homes and other resources that now 
have few incentives. </p>
<p>Goal 4: Strengthen and expand the coordinated network of all historic preservation organizations throughout the state. </p>
<p>Delegate more preservation decisions to the state and local levels but retain federal agencies' ability to protect national 
preservation interests and to mediate between competing state, local, public and private interests. </p>
<p>Goal 5: Protect and use Georgia's historic places so that they may exist into the future. </p>
<p>Focus more on training, increasing public awareness, and providing the legal framework and financial support for protection, 
rather than on control of preservation decisions. </p>
<p>Find solutions to technical preservation problems such as lead-based paint or successful sustainable development techniques, 
and rapidly distribute the information nationwide. </p>
<p>State Level Action Needed </p>
<p>Goal 1: Achieve widespread public awareness and involvement in historic preservation in Georgia. </p>
<p>Work in partnership with the Historic Preservation Division to more effectively communicate the preservation message to a 
broader audience. </p>
<p>Encourage and actively seek the participation of groups that have not traditionally been members of preservation 
organizations. </p>
<p>Develop partnerships with other organizations with similar goals, such as environmental groups, planning organizations, tourism 
organizations, and local government organizations, to encourage them to become active in preservation. </p>
<p>Goal 2: Gather information about all historic resources in Georgia, and make the information accessible for planning, advocacy 
and educational purposes. </p>
<p>Work cooperatively with the Historic Preservation Division to develop a Geographic Information System for historic 
resources so that data can be shared among state and other agencies, and historic resources can be included in State agency 
planning. </p>
<p>Contribute to the database of historic properties by carrying out studies and developing historic contexts identified as priorities 
by the Historic Preservation Division. </p>
<p>Seek federal and state funding for archeological site evaluation and recording throughout the state. </p>
<p>Goal 3: Secure financial and legal tools sufficient to preserve the significant historic resources in Georgia. </p>
<p>Support efforts to increase the Georgia Heritage 2000 funding to meet existing needs for rehabilitation, surveys and planning, 
and special initiatives. </p>
<p>Participate in national efforts to retain federal preservation law, programs and funding. </p>
<p>Provide ideas and assist in the development of new state and federal legislation that would provide new protection or 
assistance to historic properties. </p>
<p>Goal 4: Strengthen and expand the coordinated network of all historic preservation organizations throughout the state. </p>
<p>Actively participate in the Historic Preservation Division's annual planning and public participation processs. </p>
<p>Establish better communication and coordination techniques with preservation and related organizations. </p>
<p>Assist local governments and organizations to become more effective in preserving historic places, by providing funding, 
training, technical assistance, legislative support, and encouragement. </p>
<p>Goal 5: Protect and use Georgia's historic places so that they may exist into the future. </p>
<p>Join in the expanding efforts to identify the costs of sprawl, the benefits of sustainable development, and the role historic 
preservation plays in defining community character. </p>
<p>Expand the use of easements, charitable donations of property, and other property-owner driven techniques of protecting 
historic places. </p>
<p>Participate in training local governments, preservation commissions, and preservation organizations in the use of preservation 
ordinances, planning, appropriate rehabilitation, and other methods of protecting historic properties at the local level. </p>
<p>Encourage the use of community development funds for rehabilitation of historic properties for affordable housing, community 
centers, and other needed projects. </p>

<p>Local Level Action Needed </p>
<p>Goal 1: Achieve widespread public awareness and involvement in historic preservation in Georgia. </p>
<p>Increase efforts to broaden the public's knowledge and appreciation for historic preservation. </p>
<p>Get children involved in learning about and protecting their heritage. </p>
<p>Keep elected and appointed officials informed of preservation projects and activities in your community and make sure they

and educational purposes. </p>
<p>Find out what historic resources exist, and keep the information current. </p>
<p>Share all new historic re-source inventory data with the Historic Preservation Division and the Regional Development Center 
to insure its use in planning. </p>
<p>Actively advocate for improved regional and local planning and sustainable development. </p>
<p>Review the local comprehensive plan to determine if historic resources have been adequately addressed, and if preservation 
goals are integrated into land use, housing, transportation, community facilities, and economic development goals. Be involved 
in updating the plan, and track the progress made in implementing the plan. </p>
<p>Nominate eligible properties to the National Register of Historic Places. </p>

get involved in these processes. </p>
<p>Disseminate information on good preservation practices for historic property protection, restoration and rehabilitation. </p>
<p>Conclusion </p>
<p>Decisions to preserve or not preserve historic places are made at all levels of government. Policies made at one level of 
government affect the actions of another level of government. Private organizations can do certain things that public agencies 
cannot. Public agencies can provide certain services and assistance and enforce laws and policies that the private sector 
cannot. Preservationists in all spheres of influence depend on the cooperation of others to accomplish their goals. The same is 
true in Georgia. By agreeing to work in concert with one another to achieve the vision and goals of the state historic 
preservation plan, the effect of our efforts will be multiplied. Historic places thereby will have a better chance of surviving into 
the future.</p>

<p>CHAPTER SEVEN </p>
<p><font size=5><strong>The Planning Process</strong></font></p>
<hr>
<p>An effective historic preservation plan must do many things. It must represent the considered views of those who will 
implement it and those who will be affected by its implementation. It must consolidate the myriad issues now confronting 
historic preservation and anticipate how those issues will play out in the future. The plan must be strategic by focusing on the 
highest priorities, effectively addressing threats and taking advantage of opportunities. It must be practical, yet present a vision 
and goals that push us beyond current practices and ways of thinking. Of equal importance to the preparation and publication 
of a planning document is the planning process from which the document was created, and the ongoing planning process that 
results in implementation of the plan. Implementation of a statewide plan would be impossible unless its goals were shared by 
many in the preservation constituency throughout the state. </p>
<p>This Plan was developed as a successor to A Vision for the Future: The Georgia Historic Preservation Plan, published in 
1989. Preparation and implementation of a statewide comprehensive plan for historic preservation is required by the National 
Park Service for a State Historic Preservation Office's continuation in the national historic preservation program. The Historic 
Preservation Division is also required to produce an &quot;action plan&quot; to implement the DNR Strategic Plan, which was adopted in 
late 1995. This plan fulfills both requirements. </p>
<p>Public Participation Phase I </p>
<p>The planning process began in earnest in November, 1994 when the Historic Preservation Division distributed a questionnaire 
to seek the comments, concerns and priorities of the general public and preservation constituencies. Although less than 100 
responses were received, the questionnaires that were returned represented a broad spectrum of organizations, areas of the 
state, professional disciplines, volunteer activities, and perspectives. The Division also made three presentations to the Georgia 
National Register Review Board at progressive stages in the process, to present findings and get feedback from the Division's 
advisory board. </p>
<p>In January and February of 1995, a series of six Planning Forums was held in Decatur, Dalton, Savannah, Fitzgerald, 
Columbus, and Washington. The Forums were widely advertised through the print media and personal invitations, and were 
attended by 411 people from many communities and organizations. The Forums were structured to provide information to the 
audience, then to elicit through discussion, written responses, and voting, specific views on historic resources, preservation 
programs, threats to resources, opportunities for preservation, services from the Historic Preservation Division, and goals for 
this Plan. The Forums were lively, well-attended, and productive. They brought into focus the widely varying viewpoints on 
preservation and historic places, and the widely varying needs for preservation services throughout Georgia. </p>
<p>Following the Planning Forums, a Preservation Roundtable session was held at the Statewide Historic Preservation 
Conference in February, to present the top preservation goals that emerged from the Forums, and to ask the participants to 
suggest high priority objectives to help reach each of the goals. </p>
<p>In-depth interviews were then conducted during the spring with a selected group of Georgia's preservation leaders, bringing 
the first phase of public input to a close. </p>
<p>Data Collection and Analysis </p>
<p>After public comments were analyzed, they were presented to the Historic Preservation Division staff at a planning retreat. 
The public comments, other findings from data analysis, special reports on preservation topics, and the study of local 
comprehensive plans formed the basis for staff input into the Division's mission statement and the Plan's goals and objectives. 
Data on historic resources, historic contexts, and distinctive aspects of Georgia history that were covered in depth in the first 
statewide historic preservation plan, A Vision for the Future, were reviewed and updated, but remain valid. This data formed 
the basis for the summary information on historic resources and for the historic resource based goals and objectives in this 
Plan. </p>
<p>Plan Development </p>
<p>The written plan was developed throughout the summer and fall of 1995, based on the public input, historic resource data, 
and trends analysis that had been completed earlier. Highlights from this analysis were shared with the Georgia National 
Register Review Board, Georgians for Preservation Action, and selected preservation leaders for reaction as the Plan 
developed. The Department of Natural Resources Strategic Plan, which was in development at the same time, helped shape 
the Georgia Historic Preservation Plan. </p>
<p>Public Participation Phase II </p>
<p>The draft Plan was reviewed by a panel of readers selected to represent a broad cross-section of opinions, regions, 
professional expertise, and areas of interest in preservation. Comments and feedback from these thirty-seven readers were 
used in revising the Plan. </p>
<p>Plan Implementation </p>
<p>The Georgia Historic Preservation Plan is designed to be put into practice, not sit on a shelf. Therefore an annual Action Plan 
will be developed by the Historic Preservation Division. The Action Plan will include specific actions that HPD will undertake 
in order to achieve the goals and objectives of the Plan. Accountability for the actions is insured by input from the public and 
the Georgia National Register Review Board and by assignment of each action to an HPD staff member. In addition, the 
Georgia Historic Preservation Plan and the annual Action Plan will be widely distributed to interest groups and the public to 
encourage them to work in partnership to achieve the goals and the vision for preservation in Georgia. HPD will seek public 
input each year as it evaluates the Historic Preservation Plan and prepares the Action Plan. </p>
<p>Revising the Plan </p>
<p>The Georgia Historic Preservation Plan is designed to guide HPD's historic preservation programs, policies, and services 
through the year 2000. The effectiveness of the Plan will be continuously monitored, and the annual Action Plan will allow for 
adjustments each year. The overall Plan will be thoroughly re-evaluated in the year 2000 to determine its validity for the future. </p>

<p>CHAPTER EIGHT </p>
<p><font size=5><strong>In Conclusion</strong></font> </p>
<hr>
<p>How shall we look ahead and shape Georgia's future? By first looking back. Grady Clay, radio commentator, veteran 
observer of cities and author of Real Places, says, &quot;figuring out how your place came to be is the first step to knowing what to 
do next....Keeping a running, truthful account of how places get shaped, shifted, thwarted, and aborted is one of the most 
important jobs in your city and mine.&quot; This is what historic preservation does. In faithfully preserving historic places we tell the 
true story of how our communities and state became the places they are today. Georgia's historic places provide our identity 
as Georgians. As the state continues to change at an ever-increasing pace, we need links with our past to provide a sense of 
self and of place. Preservation of historic resources provides economic benefits that cannot be duplicated by new 
development. Preservation encourages more sensible development patterns that make our communities more livable. Our 
vision for Georgia in the new century must include our historic resources. </p>
<p>The historic places that make Georgia special will not preserve themselves. If they are to survive in the face of rapid change, 
we must plan ahead and work together to ensure their survival. The task will not be easy, for preservation takes the long view 
in a society that looks for the quick fix. Preservation is a decision for quality of life, when most decisions are based only on the 
short-term bottom line. Preservation requires cooperation among many partners when the trend is toward separation and 
competition. But we must succeed. </p>
<p>What is the alternative? A Georgia where communities have disappeared into nameless, repetitive areas of endless sprawl, 
devoid of character. A Georgia whose major cities have lost their center to suburbanization. A Georgia whose children lose 
hope in the future because they have no sense of the accomplishments of their past. </p>
<p>Each community leader, preservation organization, historic property owner, preservation supporter, elected official, and 
Georgia citizen has a stake in the future of Georgia, and each of us has a vital role to play in preserving our heritage for the 
future. </p>
<p>The Historic Preservation Division will strive to fulfill its mission to promote the preservation and use of historic places for a 
better Georgia. The Division will do all it can to turn the new vision into reality. Whether this vision will one day come about 
will be determined by a thousand individual decisions. The choices we make and our commitment to the vision for 
preservation will decide Georgia's future. The future is now. Will we accept the challenge? </p>

<hr>
<p>Historic Preservation Element of the Local Comprehensive Plan </p>
<p>The Georgia Planning Act of 1989 created the framework for
local comprehensive planning in Georgia. The Act requires
inclusion of a historic preservation element along with land use,
transportation, housing, economic development, recreation and
other elements. For preservation to be effective, it must be
fully incorporated into a community's planning and decision
making process. </p>
<p>The Department of Natural Resources' Historic Preservation
Division provides survey and planning asssistance to communities
throughout Georgia. HPD compiles historic property survey data
statewide and disseminates it through the Regional Development
Centers. Technical assistance and state and federal funding are
available to assist Georgia communities in surveying historic
properties. Approximately ten new community surveys are completed
each year. Limited federal funding is available for planning,
National Register evaluation and registration, local government
programs, archeological research and information/education
activities. HPD staff and RDC Historic Preservation Planners can
provide assistance with planning and any other preservation
activities. </p>
<p>Model Community Preservation Plan </p>
<p>I. Identification of Local Historic Properties </p>
<p>A. Preliminary area analysis B. Outline of local developmental
history C. Statement of unique or distinctive aspects of local
prehistory, history and historic properties D. Field survey of
historic properties (optional) </p>
<p>II. Evaluation of Current Trends and Influences on Historic
Preservation </p>
<p>A. Analysis of population, economic, land use, housing,
transportation, and other change in the community B. Analysis of
opportunities for preservation C. Analysis of threats to
preserving local historic properties </p>
<p>III. Community Consensus on Goals and Priorities for
Preservation of Historic Properties (Include: elected officials,
community leaders, preservation organizations, special interest
groups, historic neighborhoods, business leaders, major
institutions, and civic organizations) </p>
<p>IV. Identification of Tools, Strategies, and Actions Needed to
Achieve Community Goals </p>
<p>A. Public awareness B. Field survey of historic properties, if
needed C. Evaluation and designation D. Legal and regulatory
protection E. Financial incentives F. Community development,
downtown or neighborhood revitaliza- tion programs </p>
<p>V. Action Plan and Implementation </p>
<p>These five steps outline the process any community should
follow in developing a comprehensive historic preservation plan.
The process incorporates the three federal standards for
preservation planning. The Department of Natural Resources'
Historic Preservation Division provides survey and planning
assistance to communities throughout Georgia. Technical
assistance and limited funding are available for developing local
preservation plans, conducting surveys, National Register
evaluation and registration, developing protection strategies,
and information and education activities. </p>

<h3>Give Wildlife A Chance!</h3>
<p>It would be difficult to picture our state without songbirds or wildflowers to brighten our days, without wild 
places to revive our spirits, without eagles to show us how to slip the bonds of earth. Georgia&#146;s wildlife resources and their 
habitats enrich our lives daily.<br>
Nongame refers to all species of wildlife (both animals and plants) that are not legally harvested. In Georgia, there are 930 
species of wild animals, of which only 55 are game, and more than 3600 species of native wild plants. Combined, these 
species make up more than 98 percent of all wildlife in our state.<br>
Headquartered in Monroe County on the Rum Creek Wildlife Management Area, the Nongame-Endangered Wildlife 
Program conducts management projects benefiting nongame wildlife as well as programs educating the public about these 
species and their needs. Although a number of projects are directed at managing state- and federally-listed endangered 
species, a primary mission of the Program is to implement management practices which will ensure the survival of all species.<br>
The success of our efforts depends on you. Look with eyes that see the world around you! Note the colorful disguise of the 
butterfly, the magnificent flight of the falcon ... the graceful bow of the pitcher plant. Do a self-study of Georgia&#146;s wildlife. You 
can begin by getting to know more about the Nongame Program on the pages that follow!</p>

<h2><img src="http://www.dnr.state.ga.us/images/wrd.gif" align=left hspace=0 width=100 height=100>Georgia Natural Heritage Program Home Page</h2>
<p>Famous eighteenth and nineteenth century pioneer naturalists such as the Bartrams and the LeContes were 
among the first to describe the natural beauty of Georgia. These early explorers noted the diversity of habitats 
found here, and discovered plants and animals never before known such as the showy Franklinia tree, the 
hairy fever-tree (Pinckneya pubens), and LeConte's sparrow. Since then, amateur and professional naturalists alike have 
extolled the physical and biological diversity of this state.</p>
<p>Five distinct physiographic provinces are represented in Georgia-the Cumberland Plateau, the Ridge and Valley, the Blue 
Ridge, the Piedmont, and the Coastal Plain. These physiographic provinces differ with respect to geology, soils, and vegetation 
types; in addition, each province has associations of plants and animals unique to Georgia or the southeastern U.S. Examples 
of these natural habitats with high numbers of rare species include granite outcrops, cedar glades, pine savannas, pitcher plant 
bogs, and sandhills.</p>
<p>Full restoration of highly-disturbed ecosystems is impossible. Therefore, in order to conserve the natural diversity of our state, 
we must protect viable, representative examples of relatively undisturbed habitats and species assemblages. The recreational, 
aesthetic, and cultural values of our remaining wild areas, their usefulness for research and education, and their unknown 
resource potential will all be lost to future generations without careful protection efforts. The ultimate success of these 
protective endeavors depends upon an accurate assessment of natural diversity based on documented occurrences of plants, 
animals, and biological communities, as well as an understanding of the ecological processes that support this diversity. These 
are the goals of the Georgia Natural Heritage Program.</p>
<p>The Georgia Natural Heritage Program (GNHP) was established in 1986, through a cooperative agreement between the 
Georgia Department of Natural Resources and The Nature Conservancy. The Nature Conservancy, a private non-profit 
conservation organization has established programs similar to GNHP in all 50 states and within several other agencies and 
countries. The GNHP is now funded entirely by state and federal monies, and is a unit of the Wildlife Resources Division, of 
the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.</p>

<h3>A Balanced Information System</h3>
<p>Establishing Priorities<br>
The Georgia Natural Heritage Program focuses first on identifying &quot;elements&quot; of special concern in Georgia. These &quot;elements&quot; 
are plant species, animal species, or natural community types which are especially rare or threatened. Elements are given 
global and state ranks of rarity based on biological and geographical factors. Distributions of the highest-ranked, rarest 
elements are investigated first.<br>
Information from scientific literature, museum and herbarium collections, knowledgeable individuals, and scientific research 
organizations is utilized extensively to document occurrences of particular elements within the state. Field surveys are then 
conducted to verify these occurrences. The biological inventory thus represents a continuous, ongoing process whose product, 
a detailed atlas of Georgia's natural diversity, is constantly updated and revised.</p>
<h3>Cataloging Information</h3>
<p>The GNHP information system consists of a group of related, centralized databases. In order to maximize the accuracy, 
accessibility, and usefulness of the biological inventory information, it is maintained in three different forms.</p>
<p>1. Manual files - Reprints, field survey reports, location records and other pertinent documents are kept for each element.</p>
<p>2. Map files - Element occurrences and boundaries of managed areas are marked on detailed U.S. Geologic Survey 
topographic maps.</p>
<p>3. Computer files - Information from the manual and map files is coded and entered into a computerized database for rapid 
cross-referencing and retrieval of records. Much of this information has been incorporated into a geographic information 
system (GIS).</p>
<p>The GNHP has catalogued information on over 4,800 element occurrences of rare species or natural communities in the state. 
Over 150 federal, state, or private properties that provide some level of protection to these resources have been mapped and 
catalogued. GNHP is currently developing a GIS database of all state-owned lands managed by the Wildlife Resources 
Division. This effort includes field surveys for rare plant species of concern and natural communities on Division properties.</p>
<p>In 1992 the GNHP completed development of a digital landcover database for the entire state, derived from LANDSAT 
satellite imagery from the years 1988 through 1990. Fifteen landcover classes were developed including six classes of 
wetlands. Digital files and 1:24,000 scale maps have been distributed through the Georgia Department of Community Affairs 
to Regional Development Centers and local governments. A wall map depicting the landcover of Georgia and a summary of 
landcover statistics are available through the Georgia Geological Survey. Digital landcover data are available through the 
Georgia GIS Clearinghouse within the University System.</p>
<h3>Using the Information System</h3>
<p>The Georgia Natural Heritage Program makes possible a more objective identification and evaluation of important natural 
areas within the state. Inventory data can be used to locate areas in greatest need of protection, and to rank these lands for 
various protection methods, including fee simple acquisition. Protection may also be accomplished by easement, conservation 
agreement or land registry. Information from the GNHP databases has been used in Georgia's Preservation 2000 and River 
Care 2000 land acquisition programs. In addition, it has supported protection efforts for rare species and natural communities 
by other agencies and conservation organizations. Information derived from the GNHP is also useful in a number of related 
activities, including:</p>
<p>Environmental review - Planners can use GNHP data to help evaluate the environmental impacts of various routing and siting 
options for development projects.</p>
<p>Natural resources development - Developers can direct projects to the least sensitive lands, avoiding areas with rare or 
threatened elements.</p>
<p>Research and education - Scientists and educators can be made aware of unique research sites; as the GNHP databases 
grow, geographical ranges of species and community types within the state will be estimated with greater accuracy.</p>
<h3>How You Can Provide Assistance</h3>
<p>The Georgia Natural Heritage Program relies on information gathered from a variety of sources to develop and sustain its 
effectiveness. You may be able to help provide such information. Do you know the location of an exemplary or relatively 
undisturbed natural community? Do you have site information for a particular endangered species? If so, please contact the 
Georgia Natural Heritage Program. The information you provide will be verified and incorporated into the database as 
appropriate.</p>
<p>A knowledgeable and active citizenry is the key to protecting our environment. The people of Georgia are the guardians of 
their own natural heritage and everyone's support is needed to ensure that this outstanding natural diversity is preserved for 
future generations.</p>
<h3>Requesting Information for Sites</h3>
<p>All site specific information requests should be by letter with accompanying map(s). The letter should contain a brief 
description of the project, as well as an explanation of the information request.</p>
<p>The location of small to medium sites should be indicated on a photocopy of a USGS 7.5 minute (1:24,000 scale) quadrangle 
map. Larger sites should be indicated on photocopies of county road maps and state highway maps. Use a yellow highlighter 
to outline the location of the site. Do not forget to include the name of the map on the photocopy.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, you will be sent a list containing all tracked elements in our databases on or within 3 miles of the 
project site. The approximate distance and direction from the site will be included. We will also include lists useful for 
determining potential occurrences of elements in the vicinity of the site.</p>
<p>Please allow two or three weeks for processing of site information requests.</p>
<h3>Requesting the Location of Elements</h3>
<p>Location information of elements is available on diskette in dBase III format for DOS. Precision is to USGS 7.5 minute quad 
and also contains the county of occurrence. More precise locations of elements are available by special arrangement. The 
location of some elements is sensitive and not available at high precision.</p>
<h3>Protected Plant Book</h3>
<p>The Protected Plants of Georgia is a 246 page document available in hardcopy by written request to the Georgia Natural 
Heritage Program at no cost. The book is an information manual on plant species designated by the State of Georgia as 
endangered, threatened, rare, or unusual. Periodic updates are issued. It is designed for all levels of interest, including students, 
educators, amateur botanists, professional biologists, and environmental consultants. The text includes an overview of the 
Wildflower Preservation Act of 1973, and a copy of the official rules promulgated by authority of the Act. Suggestions for 
devising and using lists of potential occurrences, management considerations, and 103 species accounts that include legal 
status, synonymy, range, illustrations, descriptions, habitat, special identification features, management recommendations, 
remarks, and selected references are found. The book also contains occurrence lists for 159 counties and five physiographic 
provinces, cross-references, glossary, and special forms. Order by mail takes approximately 10 days for delivery.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>What can P</strong><sup><strong>2</strong></sup><strong>AD
do for you?</strong></p>
<p>P&#178;AD offers businesses, industries, and local and state
government agencies technical assistance in developing and
implementing pollution prevention programs. Technical assistance
is given in response to phone inquires, electronic
communications, mail, workshops, seminars, and on-site visits.
Assistance is free, confidential, and non-regulatory in nature. </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD's <a href="bio.htm">technical staff</a> can
assist you with many aspects of pollution prevention, including,
but not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>reduction of waste</li>
    <li>reuse of waste</li>
    <li>recycling of waste</li>
    <li>equipment or technology modifications</li>
    <li>reformulation or redesign of products</li>
    <li>substitution of raw materials</li>
    <li>housekeeping and maintenance</li>
    <li>training and inventory control</li>
</ul>
<p>All requests for information and services can be directed to
our information manager, Jancie Hatcher:</p>
<ul>
    <li>phone - (404) 651-5120 or 1-800-685-2443</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>P</strong><sup><strong>2</strong></sup><strong>AD
maintains confidentiality of proprietary information and client
reports.</strong></p>

Center</a></h4>

<h3><a name="Information Center">Information Center</a> </h3>
<p>The P<sup>2</sup>AD Information Center (Center) is the point
of entry for technical assistance. Answers may be in the form of
mailed publications, suggestions from staff, and referrals for
voluntary on-site assessments. </p>
<p>The Information Center, serviced by a technical staff person,
contains a library of more than 2,700 documents, journal
articles, and books pertaining to pollution prevention,
recycling, and household hazardous waste. These are used to
answer inquiries about specific pollution prevention problems.
All documents have been abstracted and catalogued in a database.
In addition to books and reports, the Center maintains more than
50 current periodical subscriptions and a collection of more than
70 videos. </p>
<p>P&#178;AD also maintains a database of pollution prevention
equipment vendors. New vendor files are added to the database at
a rate of approximately 20 every month. Currently the database
contains information on more than 200 companies and 64
consultants. </p>
<p>In addition to in-house resources, the Center has access to a
wide variety of outside knowledge. The staff routinely accesses
the holdings at the Georgia Tech and Georgia State University
libraries. P&#178;AD uses the services of the Waste Reduction
Resource Center (WRRC), a regional source for pollution
prevention information funded by EPA and the Tennessee Valley
Authority. Lastly, the staff uses the Internet (World Wide Web,
gopher sites, etc.) and electronic mailing lists to research
specific information for clients. When confronted with a
challenging situation, P&#178;AD's technical staff can pose
questions to the country's experts who may have a possible
solution or can provide contacts to furnish needed information. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="On-site Assessments">On-site Assessments</a> </h3>
<p>A visit to your facility by P<sup>2</sup>AD's engineers can
provide new insight into improving efficiency and reducing waste
for your operation. </p>
<p>In working with small companies, a P&#178;AD technical staff
person performs an assessment to identify waste generating
processes and waste streams. For larger companies, P&#178;AD acts
as a facilitator to guide company managers in a self-assessment
of their waste streams. The Georgia Tech Economic Development
Institute assists P&#178;AD staff in performing assessments as
needed. All information is confidential. </p>
<p>After an assessment is made, a written report or fact sheet is
provided to the company management offering options for pollution
prevention, estimated waste reduction, and cost savings. Report
recommendations may contain several or all of the following:
redesign of production methods, non-hazardous substitutes for
hazardous materials, advice on good operating and housekeeping
practices, strategies to reduce energy and pollutant loadings for
publicly owned treatment works, and cost benefit analysis and
payback period for pollution prevention initiatives. </p>
<p>Six months after the report is delivered, P&#178;AD conducts a
follow-up discussion with clients to learn whether the company
has implemented any of the suggestions presented and whether more
information is required. A company is not required to implement
any or all of the recommendations. Their involvement is strictly
voluntary. </p>
<p>To date, a wide variety of assessments have been performed at
companies ranging in size from less than ten to more than 25,000
employees. An assessment report varies, depending on the size and
complexity of the company's business or manufacturing processes.
Assessments have been completed for businesses in many different
sectors including auto parts and maintenance, pulp and paper,
textiles, metal fabrication, and chemical manufacturing. In
addition, the Division currently has established on-going
relationships with several large companies based in Georgia. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Employee Training Sessions">Employee Training
Sessions</a> </h3>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD provides pollution prevention training on-site
for a company's personnel. In these sessions, a cross section of
the company's employees (i.e., environmental, financial,
purchasing, upper management, line workers) can be trained
together. P<sup>2</sup>AD staff teach team building, how to do a
self-assessment on waste reduction, full cost accounting of
waste, recognizing waste reduction opportunities, and financial
analysis of pollution prevention initiatives. The objective of
on-site training is to provide information and knowledge about
pollution prevention that will be retained and used by the
company in the future. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Seminars and Workshops">Seminars and Workshops</a></h3>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD sponsors seminars and workshops throughout the
state on various pollution prevention and waste reduction topics.
Topics may be industry specific or general pollution prevention
information. Some examples of workshops conducted by P<sup>2</sup>AD
include solvent substitution; pollution prevention for the
aircraft, aerospace, and airline industry; and storm water and
pollution prevention for trucking facilities.</p>

<h2 align="center">Pollution Prevention Partners</h2>
<h2 align="center">Recognition Program</h2>
<hr>
<p>Pollution Prevention Partners (P&#179;) is a three level
certification program that recognizes and rewards continuous
pollution prevention performance and environmental improvement by
Georgia industries. Companies that qualify for the P&#179;
program demonstrate to their customers, employees, and community
a commitment to preventing pollution and waste, increasing
efficiency, and improving the environment. The P&#179; program is
administered by the Pollution Prevention Assistance Division
(P&#178;AD) of the Department of Natural Resources. </p>
<p>The Entry Level recognizes facilities or plants that
demonstrate a commitment to developing a successful pollution
prevention program. Facilities that apply for the Entry Level are
eligible for a free, on-site pollution prevention assessment and
assistance in qualifying for the program from P&#178;AD.
Facilities that qualify for the Entry Level are eligible for
recognition in P&#178;AD publications and will receive a
certificate. </p>
<p>The Achievement Level recognizes facilities or plants that
have established a pollution prevention program and are making
progress toward meeting reduction goals. Facilities that apply
for the Achievement Level are eligible for a free,
non-regulatory, on-site pollution prevention assessment and
assistance in qualifying for the program from P&#178;AD.
Facilities that qualify for and maintain the Achievement Level
will receive public recognition in P&#178;AD publications, a
plaque and up to a 10% reduction in hazardous waste trust fund
and Toxic Release Inventory fees paid to the Georgia
Environmental Protection Division (EPD) for one year. Facilities
that continue to show progress toward meeting pollution
prevention goals may receive up to a 10% reduction in fees in
each of two additional years. The savings from these fees must be
allocated to pollution prevention activities at the facility. <b>(The
ability of EPD to reduce fees is contingent upon approval by the
Georgia General Assembly and the Governor in 1997)</b> </p>
<p>The Model Level recognizes facilities or plants that are
industry leaders in pollution prevention. Model Level facilities
incorporate pollution prevention into daily business activities,
and have made substantial progress toward meeting pollution
prevention reduction goals. Facilities that apply for the Model
Level are eligible for a free, non-regulatory, on-site pollution
prevention assessment and assistance in qualifying for the
program from P&#178;AD. Facilities that qualify for and maintain
the Model Level will receive public recognition in P&#178;AD
publications, a plaque, a flag and up to a 25% reduction in
hazardous waste trust fund and Toxic Release Inventory fees paid
to EPD for one year. Facilities that continue to show progress
toward meeting pollution prevention goals may receive up to a 25%
reduction in each of two additional years. The savings from the
fees must be allocated to pollution prevention activities at the
facility. <b>(The ability of EPD to reduce fees is contingent
upon approval by the Georgia General Assembly and the Governor in
1997)</b> </p>
<p>Pollution prevention is defined by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) as &#147;the use of materials, processes,
and practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants
or wastes at the source.&#148; Examples of pollution prevention
activities include inventory management/purchasing procedures,
source reduction, process modifications, housekeeping/good
operating practices, material substitutions, redesign of product,
pollution prevention education/outreach, and in-process
recycling. Disposal, off site recycling or reprocessing of wastes
is not pollution prevention. </p>

<h3><a name="Manufacturing Sector">Manufacturing Sector</a> </h3>
<p><a name="Toxic"><strong>Toxic and Hazardous Waste</strong></a> </p>
<p>The Georgia manufacturing industry (Standard Industrial
Classification Codes 2000 to 3900) consists of more than 10,000
companies. Approximately 600 companies reported waste releases in
1994, with a total of 31,000 tons of toxic pollutants emitted to
the air, land, and waters of Georgia. Six manufacturing sectors
which release the most significant toxic chemicals were
identified from information contained in the Toxic Release
Inventory (TRI) report and the biennial hazardous waste report.
These high priority manufacturing sectors include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Pulp and Paper Products (SIC 26) </li>
    <li>Chemical and Allied Products (SIC 28) </li>
    <li>Transportation Equipment (SIC 37) </li>
    <li>Rubber and Plastic Products (SIC 30) </li>
    <li>Fabricated Metal Products (SIC 34) </li>
    <li>Printing and Publishing (SIC 27) </li>
</ul>
<p>A staff engineer was assigned to each sector to determine the
manufacturing processes used by these industries and to research
and develop pollution prevention expertise and solutions which
could be applied across the sectors. The information gained
through comprehensive technical literature reviews, extensive
telephone surveys, and conducting follow up on-site assessments
at numerous businesses within the sector is being used to prepare
sector-specific information and workshops. These outreach tools
are targeted to overcome key pollution prevention impediments
identified through the sector assessment process. </p>
<p><a name="Solid Waste"><strong>Solid Waste</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that
non-hazardous, industrial process waste constituted over 57% of
the total solid waste generated in the United States in 1985.
About 39% consisted of special wastes (e.g. fly ash, mining
wastes), 2% was regulated hazardous waste, and about 2% was
municipal solid waste (MSW). MSW is generally thought of as
household waste; however, under the EPA definition commercial,
institutional, and industrial wastes (other than process waste)
can also be considered MSW. </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD has refocused some of its resources to address
the issue of non-hazardous, industrial solid waste reduction. The
approach will rely on existing activities, programs and
partnerships to develop and provide for solid waste reduction
options to Georgia manufacturers. </p>
<p>As a means to develop more effective reduction strategies, the
Environmental Protection Division, the Department of Community
Affairs, and P<sup>2</sup>AD launched a cooperative effort to
characterize the solid waste being disposed across Georgia.
On-site surveys have been conducted at 131 state landfills. A
goal of the survey was to obtain a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the
mix of residential, commercial, and industrial solid waste
disposed at each specific landfill. With 80 percent of the
surveys completed, preliminary data indicate about 22% of the
solid waste being disposed at landfills is from industrial
sources. The principal industrial waste streams observed were
textiles, construction and demolition debris, wastewater sludges,
wood wastes, food processing wastes, auto salvage wastes, and
waste from the manufactured housing industry. </p>
<p>A large amount of non-hazardous industrial waste is also being
disposed on-site at 43 private industry landfills in Georgia.
Little information is currently available from EPD files
concerning the character of the waste; however, a shift to
off-site disposal of this industrial waste could severely affect
municipal solid waste disposal capacity. Although EPD is
responsible for monitoring these landfills, P<sup>2</sup>AD is
available to assist companies wishing to reduce their waste
streams. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="C &amp; I Sector">Commercial and Institutional
Sector</a> </h3>
<p>As part of restructuring the solid waste responsibilities in
the state, P<sup>2</sup>AD is assuming the lead state role for
commercial and institutional solid waste reduction. Commercial
sectors include office buildings, retail, and service
establishments. Institutions include school, libraries,
hospitals, and prisons. According to Department of Labor
statistics, there were about 180,500 commercial businesses in
Georgia in 1995. As indicated above, P<sup>2</sup>AD, DCA, and
EPD conducted on-site surveys of 131 landfill sites across the
state to gather characterization information. The preliminary
data indicates that approximately 33% of the estimated 9 million
tons of waste disposed in Georgia's municipal landfills is from
commercial and institutional sources. The estimation does not
take into account the waste disposed of in those commercial
landfills which keep their disposal types and quantities
proprietary. </p>
<p>Using the survey results and supplemental information, P<sup>2</sup>AD
will seek to identify specific commercial solid waste streams in
order to develop waste reduction strategies and market
development opportunities. Both the waste types and quantities
disposed are important factors in this effort. It is likely that
the commercial and institutional solid waste program will use the
six basic strategies established by P<sup>2</sup>AD in addressing
waste streams for the manufacturing sector. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Agricultural Sector">Agricultural Sector</a> </h3>
<p>Agriculture is a leading industry in Georgia contributing more
than $38 billion annually to Georgia's $180 billion economic
output. Agriculture, including the production, processing,
packaging, and transporting of farm products, employs
approximately one in six Georgians and almost half the state's
manufacturing jobs are in agribusiness. Georgia's top ten farm
commodities include commercial broilers, peanuts, cattle, eggs,
vegetables, dairy products, cotton, hogs, nursery/greenhouse, and
tobacco. Besides these commodities, the production and
distribution of farm inputs and machinery contribute an
additional $1.5 billion and employ about 15,000 people. </p>
<p>As one of the largest industries in Georgia, agricultural
production has significant potential for environmental
degradation. Contamination from agricultural practices is
estimated to contribute approximately 65% of all non-point source
pollution. Animals produced in Georgia generate an estimated 22
million tons of manure each year. In addition, yearly crop
production in Georgia uses approximately 1.67 million tons of
commercial fertilizers. Many of these nutrients, if not managed
and used properly, can degrade both the surface and ground water.
The $156 million worth of pesticides used in agricultural crop
production can also pose significant risk to environmental
resources. Agriculture also uses significant amounts of fuel,
oil, and energy, contributes millions of tons of sediment from
soil erosion, and can create many air quality concerns including
odor and dust generation. </p>
<p>The diversity of agricultural industries presents many
obstacles to the adoption of pollution prevention technologies. P<sup>2</sup>AD
recognized this need and allocated a budget to establish an
agricultural pollution prevention program in cooperation with The
University of Georgia's Biological and Agricultural Engineering
Department. The goal of the Georgia Agricultural Pollution
Prevention Program is to encourage the agricultural community to
actively practice voluntary pollution prevention with a
commitment to reducing emissions, waste, and the use of energy,
water, and dangerous materials to the greatest extent practical. </p>
<p>This program also functions using both responsive and
proactive approaches. The program supplies technical assistance
and information on pollution prevention practices to any farmer
or industry that requests it. This includes requests for
technical assistance in site selection or facility layouts,
information on new technologies or pollution prevention
strategies, and individual site assessments. On-site pollution
prevention assessments for production farms or processing
facilities are available by program staff. The agricultural
program also proactively seeks voluntary involvement and
educational opportunities. Areas where more research or
educational efforts are needed have been identified, and the
program serves as a catalyst for initiating and conducting these
types of projects. Additionally, specific elements of the program
are focused on enhancing the understanding and enlisting the
support of various agricultural organizations and agribusinesses
in promoting pollution prevention practices. </p>
<p>The Agricultural Pollution Prevention Program has accomplished
many objectives since its inception in late 1994. An initial
project was the development of two position papers that focused
on identifying the opportunities and impediments for pollution
prevention in agricultural crop production and livestock
production. These papers will serve to focus the program on
priority issues. The program has also been actively providing
technical assistance to the agricultural community. Some examples
include the development of nine publications, five news articles,
and a quarterly newsletter, responses to over 80 requests for
technical assistance resulting in over 30 site visits,
participation in 11 different training sessions for a variety of
audiences, and presentations at more than 30 conferences or
exhibitions with more than 240,000 potential contacts.
Additionally, the program is active in several applied research
projects and has developed working relationships with much of the
agricultural community leadership. </p>
<p><a name="Horticultural"><strong>Pollution Prevention Program
for the Horticultural (Green) Industry</strong></a></p>
<p>P&#178;AD has awarded two applied research grants to the
University of Georgia's agricultural experimental station in
Griffin for a horticultural demonstration project. This grant
money will be used to support the development of a 65 acre tract
of land to become The Georgia Station Research and Education
Garden. The Garden will be developed with input from the
horticultural industry and directed towards industry, gardener,
and homeowner needs with emphasis on interpretation of ongoing
research. The goals of the Garden include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Develop innovative programs that interpret research for
        the horticultural industry, homeowners, professional
        educators, gardeners and students. </li>
    <li>Develop the Garden as a stimulating location for
        educational and professional opportunities. </li>
    <li>Establish positive community relationships and facilitate
        community involvement in Garden programs. </li>
    <li>Develop a state-of-the-art research and educational
        facility with a secure funding base for Garden programs. </li>
</ul>
<p>A team of scientists has formed a working group to solve
problems for the ornamental plant industry, especially those
prevalent in the humid southeast. Areas of research will include
the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Create environmentally sound management practices. </li>
    <li>Maximize plant quality and/or adaptability for the needs
        of the end users.</li>
    <li>Improve technical and economic efficiency of commercial
        ornamental plant production and marketing. </li>
    <li>Communicate research-based recommendations to the green
        industry. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Public Sector">Public Sector</a> </h3>
<p>To broaden the Division's services to include the general
public, P<sup>2</sup>AD's mission has been expanded to address
the issues of household hazardous waste, used automotive fluids,
and radon. </p>
<p><a name="HHW"><strong>Household Hazardous Waste</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Household hazardous waste (HHW) is a product which is
discarded from a home or a similar source that is either
ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic. Examples of common
household hazardous wastes are oil-based paint, batteries,
cleaners, and pesticides. It is estimated that 1.6 million tons
of municipal solid waste disposed of per year is household
hazardous waste, or between 0.3 - 0.5% of the total municipal
solid waste stream. The numbers vary depending on the region and
the season. The number of household hazardous waste collection
programs in the U.S. has increased from 2 in 1980 to 1,648 in
1994. Based on a statewide household hazardous waste survey to
determine the storage and disposal habits of Georgians, the
majority of Georgians stated that they disposed of unwanted
household hazardous products in their trash. Most polled
indicated that the reason that they had leftover hazardous
products in their home was that they had bought too much. The
demographic information from the survey is being used to target
specific audiences that mismanage or improperly dispose of
household hazardous waste. </p>
<p>A common approach to handling HHW in many communities is
collection at recycling or drop off facilities. The high cost of
sponsoring an event and the low participation rates are two
negative aspects of collection which make this approach suspect
as a practical and economically feasible method. P<sup>2</sup>AD
is taking an innovative approach to addressing the issues
associated with improper management of household hazardous waste.
In keeping with P<sup>2</sup>AD's founding philosophy of
prevention, P<sup>2</sup>AD is focused on prevention and proper
management of household hazardous waste. The concept is simple.
Collection does not solve the problem of improper management of
household hazardous waste or encourage alternative management
methods (i.e. reuse or recycling), but only acts as a
afterthought or control mechanism to correct the mismanagement or
inefficient use of hazardous household products. Prevention
reduces or eliminates waste, thereby diminishing the need for
collection. </p>
<p>A Household Hazardous Waste Work Group was convened in January
1995 to study household hazardous waste issues and make
recommendation to the Division's Director about the feasibility
of a state-sponsored program which would reduce household
hazardous waste generation in Georgia. The recommendations were: </p>
<ol>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should serve as the lead state agency for
        HHW prevention and management. </li>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop guidelines for conducting
        HHW prevention and management programs. </li>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote pollution prevention of
        HHW through various public education programs. </li>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should fund several pilot household
        hazardous waste collection programs in the state, as
        funds are available.</li>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote collection of various
        problem HHW items. </li>
</ol>
<p>The Division's HHW activities up to the present are based on
the first three recommendations offered by the HHW Work Group.
The Division is using the work group's recommendations as
guidance to develop the format of the household hazardous waste
prevention and management (HHWP&amp;M) program. </p>
<p>It is P<sup>2</sup>AD's intention to work through local
governments to educate and inform the citizens in the state about
household hazardous waste issues. The Division is working with
UGA's Vinson Institute of Government in developing a
&quot;Household Hazardous Waste: Best Management Practices&quot;
handbook. The handbook is designed for use by local governments
to assist officials in answering citizen's inquiries about
household hazardous waste. Another handbook will be developed to
provide guidance to local governments on developing household
hazardous waste programs. In addition to the materials developed
for local governments, the Division will develop materials to
educate the public about the prevention and proper management of
household hazardous waste. </p>
<p><a name="Auto"><strong>Automotive Fluids</strong></a> </p>
<p>Over 200 million gallons of used motor oil are generated
annually by the 45 million Americans who change their own motor
oil in their cars and trucks, better known as the
do-it-yourselfers (DIYs). In 1991, DIY used oil amounted to about
15 percent of the total oil generated by all sources, but 50
percent of all the used oil that was improperly disposed of
originated from DIYs. Improper disposal of just one gallon of oil
can make one million gallons of water undrinkable. Oil and
antifreeze are also toxic to animals and marine life. Handling of
used automotive fluids by DIYs is largely unmonitored and
unregulated. However, as of 1995, 30 states and the District of
Columbia had some type of state-sponsored used oil program that
addressed the DIY population. </p>
<p>It is estimated that about 19 million gallons of passenger car
motor oil are sold in Georgia annually. Much of this oil is
purchased by DIYs. About 5.5 million oil filters are also bought
by DIYs each year in Georgia. Based on national statistics, as
much as five million gallons of used oil may be improperly
disposed of in Georgia annually. Spent filters may also be a
significant waste stream, as national statistics indicate that
approximately 90 percent of used filters are thrown into the
trash rather than being recycled. In Georgia, the state's role in
promoting recycling programs for automotive fluids and filters
has been limited. </p>
<p>In a discussion with EPD concerning household hazardous waste,
EPD requested that P<sup>2</sup>AD take on the responsibility for
the used automotive fluids program. An Automotive Fluids Work
Group was convened in late 1995 by P<sup>2</sup>AD to provide
recommendations for creating a voluntary, state-sponsored program
that would encourage the proper recovery of consumer-generated
used automotive fluids and oil filters. A statewide household
hazardous waste survey conducted by the Division in 1995
indicated that only 49% of Georgians who change their own oil
take the used oil to a collection point for recycling. The
recommendations of the work group are shown below, and are also
contained in the actions detailed later in this plan. The
recommendations were: </p>
<ol>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should &quot;benchmark&quot; all existing
        DIY collection locations within the state, and identify
        areas of inadequate collection capacity. </li>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should advertise the location of DIY
        collection sites to the public. </li>
    <li>If deemed necessary by the director, P<sup>2</sup>AD
        should sponsor legislation to put a fee on oil to fund
        the used automotive fluids program. </li>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should determine if incentives for
        participation in the used automotive fluids program are
        needed for retailers and/or the public. </li>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should establish a comprehensive
        education program to promote collection of used
        DIY-generated automotive fluids and filters in Georgia. </li>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should attempt to clarify problems with
        legislation and regulations that hinder proper management
        of used automotive fluids. </li>
</ol>
<p>An unknown quantity of antifreeze is sold to DIYs in Georgia.
However, the HHW survey mentioned above indicated that 47% of
people who service their own cars changed their antifreeze. The
most common methods of disposal for used antifreeze were to pour
it on the ground or put it in the trash. </p>
<p>Currently, used automotive fluid collection points in Georgia
are mainly located at businesses and local governments that
volunteer to collect these fluids and filters, and they are not
required to report the amounts collected or recycled. P<sup>2</sup>AD
has &quot;benchmarked&quot; the existing DIY collection
locations, and has prepared a comprehensive listing of locations
for recycling of oil, filters, and antifreeze. </p>
<p><a name="Radon"><strong>Radon</strong></a> </p>
<p>According to the Surgeon General, radon is the second leading
cause of lung cancer in the United States. Furthermore, the U.S.
Congress' long-term goal for radon is to have the indoor radon
levels be no higher than levels outside. A survey conducted by
EPA during Winter 1988/1989 concluded that 15% of the homes in
North Georgia revealed concentrations of radon greater than 4
picocuries per liter (pCi/L). Less than 10% of the homes tested
in the rest of the state had measurements greater than 4pCi/L.
One county had several schools with all of the classrooms' radon
levels greater than 4pCi/L. </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD will serve as the lead state agency for radon.
The Division assumed the responsibility from the Department of
Human Resources under the written approval of the Governor. The
mission of the Division's radon program is to inform the public
about the health risks associated with radon, to increase
awareness about and encourage testing for radon, and to support
local government efforts to address radon issues in their
communities. </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD will work closely with all agencies and
organizations that are either involved or interested in providing
radon programs. P<sup>2</sup>AD will coordinate with the
Association County Commissioners of Georgia (ACCG) to solicit
local government support for radon programs, develop and
disseminate information to local governments, and provide
technical assistance to local governments on radon-related
issues. P<sup>2</sup>AD will also provide financial assistance to
local governments in the form of a matching grant. </p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) have combined to sponsor an innovative,
cost-sharing program to promote National Industrial
Competitiveness through Energy, Environment, and Economics. The
grant program, known as NICE<sup>3</sup>, provides funding to
state/industry partnerships for projects that develop and
demonstrate advances in energy efficiency and clean production
technologies. Since 1991, NICE<sup>3</sup> has sponsored 26
projects, totaling $7.8 million of DOE funding. </p>
<p>Industry applicants must submit project proposals through a
state energy, pollution prevention, or business development
office. P&#178;AD is an administrator for the program in Georgia
and chooses projects by evaluating them with the criteria
provided. Funds are awarded to state/industry partnerships that
can match DOE/EPA federal funds dollar for dollar. Awardees
receive a one-time grant of up to $400,000 for the proposed
project. After the initial funding, the awardee is expected to
commercialize the process or technology. P&#178;AD has partnered

<p><a name="Locgov"><strong>P</strong><sup><strong>2</strong></sup><strong>AD
and Local Government Pollution Prevention Programs</strong></a></p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD is currently undertaking outreach efforts to
inform local governments about the role of the Division and its
services. The Division is involved in ongoing relationships with
the Georgia Municipal Association (GMA) and the Association of
County Commissioners in Georgia (ACCG), and will promote the
creation of local government pollution prevention programs to
these groups' members. P<sup>2</sup>AD will work with interested
local governments to evaluate the feasibility of establishing
programs that encourage a pollution prevention ethic in local
industries, businesses, and within their own county or city
organizations. </p>
<p>The Division also seeks to encourage actions by local
governments such as the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Promoting the services of P<sup>2</sup>AD to industries
        and businesses in the local government's area</li>
    <li>Becoming participants in regional pollution prevention
        networking groups to be established statewide in 1997 </li>
    <li>Providing local recognition for businesses and industries
        in their area that are successfully pursuing pollution
        prevention activities</li>
    <li>Serving as a distribution point for educational materials
        aimed at local consumers and civic groups on topics such
        as used oil recycling and household hazardous waste
        prevention and management issues </li>
</ul>
<p>Why Local Government Pollution Prevention? </p>
<p>Local government pollution prevention programs can provide
individual assistance to local industries that augments
assistance provided by state programs such as P<sup>2</sup>AD.
Local government programs can also serve as a catalyst for
pollution prevention activities in the city or county's own
waste-generating operations. Since relationships already exist in
a community between government agencies and businesses,
industries may feel more comfortable requesting assistance from a
local government program. Local government agencies are more
cognizant of a company's culture and specific issues which may
affect a company's decision to implement a suggested alternative.
Individuals within the local government may also be more familiar
with local regulations and permitting requirements which play an
important role in deciding if a pollution prevention alternative
is feasible from a regulatory standpoint. </p>
<p>Local government programs which promote pollution prevention
represent a win-win situation for industries and the community.
By forming partnerships with businesses to encourage pollution
prevention in daily practices, local governments protect their
own community's resources while increasing the competitiveness of
the local employers. For more information on how to start a local
government pollution prevention program, contact Jancie Hatcher
at (404) 651-5120 or 1-800-685-2443.</p>

<h3><strong>Mission Statement</strong> </h3>
<p>The mission of the Pollution Prevention Assistance Division
(P&#178;AD) is to develop programs and activities to facilitate
reduction of pollution at the source, and instill a pollution
prevention ethic which is consistent with the protection of human
health and the environment. </p>
<hr>
<h3>History of P&#178;AD </h3>
<p>In the 1980's, the prevailing philosophy dictated that
hazardous waste be managed through treatment and disposal methods
using pollution control technology. Accordingly, the Georgia
Hazardous Waste Management Authority (Authority) proposed to
build a hazardous waste management facility, including an
incinerator, to manage the state's hazardous waste. </p>
<p>There was significant opposition to this plan. Therefore, in
1991, the Authority restructured and expanded its mission to
include the development of programs to facilitate the reduction
of hazardous waste at the source through various voluntary
measures. With these programs in place, the Authority
subsequently determined that a state-sponsored hazardous waste
management facility was not economically viable or needed in
Georgia at this time. As a result, it was decided that the
Authority go dormant and pollution prevention continue as a state
sponsored program. Every two years the Division is required by
law to determine whether Georgia produces enough hazardous waste
to warrant revisiting the need for a state sponsored facility. To
date, a need has not been established. </p>
<p>The Georgia Pollution Prevention Assistance Division was
created by the Georgia General Assembly as a non-regulatory
Division of the Department of Natural Resources to begin
operation October 1, 1993. The Division was designated by
Governor Miller as a &quot;One Stop Shop&quot; for Georgia
businesses interested in voluntarily finding ways to reduce their
generation of solid and hazardous waste; emissions; and releases
of pollutants into the air, water, and land. To accomplish this
goal, P&#178;AD has developed a variety of innovative <a
href="can_do.htm">technical assistance</a> programs including,
but not limited to, planning, information center, workshops,
on-site pollution prevention assessments, and training. These
activities are designed not only to provide technical assistance
to companies, but also to guide them in developing pollution
prevention programs tailored to their specific needs. </p>
<hr>
<h3>P&#178;AD Staff </h3>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD's staff consists of 15 full-time personnel and
three contract personnel who bring a broad range of experience
and expertise to P&#178;AD's activities and programs. Many of the
staff have worked for state and local government, industry,
private consultants, and environmental organizations. The staff
has expertise in management of solid and hazardous waste, water
quality, recycling, industrial processing and design,
manufacturing, energy, agriculture and public relations. They
include environmental, mechanical, chemical, and agricultural
engineers; chemists; biologists; a lawyer; a public relations
expert, and policy analysts. </p>
<hr>
<h3>Core Strategies</h3>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD offers a variety of <a href="programs.htm">programs</a>
to assist Georgia's citizens, businesses, government, and the
general public in improving by preventing waste. The Division's
clients generally fall within four groups: the manufacturing
sector, the commercial and institutional sector, the agricultural
sector, and the public sector. Five core strategies represent
basic approaches employed by P<sup>2</sup>AD in conducting its
daily operation and assistance activities. They range from
ensuring public and business input into Division programs to
promoting technology transfer through outreach. The basic core
strategies of P<sup>2</sup>AD include: </p>
<p><strong>Actively Seek Public Input</strong> </p>
<p>To instill the pollution prevention ethic and reduce pollution
at the source, P<sup>2</sup>AD must develop programs which are
embraced by the public and private sectors. This is accomplished
when the these sectors participate meaningfully in the formation
and implementation of pollution prevention policies and programs.
P<sup>2</sup>AD routinely uses four public involvement approaches
to gather input into its planning process. These techniques are:
surveys, focus groups, work groups, and public comment. </p>
<p><strong>Operate a Responsive Technical Assistance Program</strong> </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD's pollution prevention program seeks voluntary
participation from businesses and others that generate waste. The
technical assistance is non-regulatory and is provided at no
charge to the client. The main elements of the technical
assistance program include an information center, telephone
technical assistance, and on-site pollution prevention
assessments. </p>
<p><strong>Proactively Identify Organizations in Need of
Assistance</strong> </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD is responsive to requests for assistance by
all businesses and other organizations. However, this approach
will not ensure that needed information and support is requested
by the most significant waste generators. These groups may not be
aware of technical assistance provided by P<sup>2</sup>AD. To
reach this array of potential clients, P<sup>2</sup>AD identifies
technical assistance needs of generators whose waste may have an
adverse effect on the public health, the environment, or may
strain the existing environmental management infrastructure. P<sup>2</sup>AD
seeks voluntary participation in its non-regulatory pollution
prevention programs by motivating businesses through tangible
technical and financial incentives and recognition for continuous
improvements. </p>
<p><strong>Unlock the Pollution Prevention Potential of
Businesses and Others </strong></p>
<p>To ensure the continuous implementation of pollution
prevention, it is important that organizations consider pollution
prevention in their daily business planning. This means that the
budgeting, purchasing, and other financial decision makers must
consider the true costs of managing wastes in addition to other
environmental management decisions. P<sup>2</sup>AD offers a
variety of services to assist businesses in making sound
decisions based on a comprehensive evaluation of their
environmental management issues. Some of these services include
on-site facilitation, assistance in understanding true waste
management costs, environmental decision-making tools, and
recognition for internalizing the pollution prevention ethic. </p>
<p><strong>Maximize Use of Existing Resources</strong> </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD uses existing resources through innovative <a
href="partners.htm">public-private partnerships</a> with the
university system; federal, state, and local government agencies;
industry and trade associations; and non-profit organizations to
enhance the spread of pollution prevention throughout the state.
Two existing technical assistance partnerships are focused
primarily on addressing the pollution prevention needs of the
industrial and the agricultural sectors. Several research
partnerships with major industrial clients are underway to
provide process improvements for Georgia's carpet and paper
industries. </p>
<p>The Georgia Environmental Partnership (GEP) teams P<sup>2</sup>AD,
the Georgia Institute of Technology's Economic Development
Institute (EDI), and the University of Georgia's (UGA) Department
of Biological and Agricultural Engineering to coordinate the
delivery of environmental solutions to Georgia business through a
regionally-based technical assistance network. GEP also works
closely with the Southeastern Environmental Resources Alliance
(SERA) to facilitate the transfer of Department of Energy (DOE)
and Department of Defense (DOD) technologies to the private
sector for commercial application to pressing environmental
problems. </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD also teams again with the UGA's Department of
Biological and Agricultural Engineering and the Cooperative
Extension Service to promote pollution prevention practices to
agribusiness and the individual farmer using outreach,
environmental assessments through Farm*A*Syst, and applied
research. </p>
<p><strong>Promote Education and Information Exchange Through
Outreach</strong> </p>
<p>Outreach is regarded as a key strategy for making the public
and private sectors aware of pollution prevention issues and
informing them of the programs and assistance which is available
to them in addressing these issues. This typically involves
developing, distributing, and presenting information to local
extension services, Chambers of Commerce, or local governments;
publishing newsletters; developing waste reduction guidance
documents; and participating in public and industry sponsored
workshops and seminars. </p>
<p>From October 1, 1993 through September 30, 1996, P<sup>2</sup>AD
staff have responded to over 750 technical assistance requests,
made presentations at over 200 events, and expanded the mailing
list of the Division's quarterly newsletter, <a

organizations and individuals. </p>

<h3>P<sup>2</sup>AD Partners with EDI </h3>
<p>As many of you know, P<sup>2</sup>AD is committed to
partnership as one way to help the Division reach the broadest
possible audience for our services in Georgia. We are pleased to
announce a new partnership with Georgia Tech's Economic
Development Institute (EDI). EDI is a technical assistance
organization with a mission of helping businesses and communities
in the areas of new enterprise development, management and
environmental assistance, and economic development. EDI provides
services through a network of eighteen regional offices
throughout Georgia. Offices are located in Dalton, Rome,
Gainesville, Cartersville, Carrollton, Athens, Augusta, Macon,
Warner Robins, Columbus, Dublin, Savannah, Albany, Douglas,
Brunswick, and several locations in metro Atlanta. Engineers in
many of EDI's field offices will receive pollution prevention
training from P<sup>2</sup>AD staff. We intend that this training
will result in a &quot;multiplier&quot; effect throughout the
state, with many more assistance providers raising awareness of
potential pollution prevention opportunities in industry. </p>
<p>We at P<sup>2</sup>AD are very excited about this partnership
for a number of reasons. First, this partnership, consistent with
the Division's guiding philosophies, leverages existing state
resources in order to better execute our mission. Whenever
possible, the Division seeks to use resources already in place,
rather than &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot;. Secondly, use of
EDI staff to help provide pollution prevention services is a good
example of the privatization approach to government. Instead of
building up a large state bureaucracy in Atlanta, P<sup>2</sup>AD
prefers to join with other organizations to deliver our programs.
Also, EDI is a group with strong local ties to Georgia
businesses, and EDI is known and trusted by the small business
community. Because of their relationship with Georgia business
and industry, EDI is a natural extension of the Division's
capability to reach small businesses, as well as the medium and
large sized firms in the state. Finally, EDI can provide to our
clients a broader range of environmental technical assistance,
including items (such as compliance assistance) that are outside
the legislative mandate of P<sup>2</sup>AD. We are looking
forward to a long and fruitful partnership with the Economic
Development Institute. </p>
<h3>Update on Other Partnerships </h3>
<p>In addition to our new association with Georgia Tech's EDI, we
also have several other currently active partnerships. The
Division's two Department of Energy National Industrial
Competitiveness through Energy, Environment, and Economics
(NICE3) projects in the carpet and pulp &amp; paper industries
involve a whole host of private and public partners in Georgia.
The carpet dyebath reuse project is now in its second year and
final technical tests prior to full in-plant demonstration are
now being conducted by Shaw Industries. Similarly, the lime mud
regeneration project being conducted by Altex Technologies began
pilot scale testing in June which will conclude later in the
summer. Successful completion of these projects and the resulting
technology transfer will allow P<sup>2</sup>AD to provide new
pollution prevention options for the textile and pulp &amp; paper
industries in Georgia. These projects are also demonstrating the
value of strong partnerships between the public and private
sectors in order to reach mutually desirable goals in waste
reduction. </p>
<p>On page 4 of this newsletter, you will read in detail about
another partnership in which P<sup>2</sup>AD has joined forces
with the University of Georgia's Agricultural Experiment Station
in Griffin. Funds from the Division helped the station establish
its <a href="garden.htm">Research and Education Garden</a>. The
Garden, in turn, also benefited from partnerships with various
local groups in Griffin. </p>
<p>Thanks to all of the organizations involved in the above
activities. P<sup>2</sup>AD looks forward to a long, productive
association with each of you! </p>
<h3>Pollution Prevention Software </h3>
<p>Thanks for your favorable response to our new pollution
prevention informational software. If you do not have a copy and
would like to obtain one, please give the office a call at (404)
651-5120 or 800-685-2443 or send us e-mail at <a
href="mailto:p2ad@ix.netcom.com">p2ad@ix.netcom.com</a>. Also, we
will be surveying some of you who received the software. If you
are contacted, please take a moment to help us evaluate the
effectiveness of the software disk.</p>

<h2 align="center">Fabricated Metal Products Sector Assessment
Near Completion Wood Products and Pulp &amp; Paper Now Available </h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by Mike Garruto, P.E., Pollution
Prevention Engineer</strong> </p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring/Summer 1996]</p>
<hr>
<p>The Winter 1996 issue of From the Source highlighted P<sup>2</sup>AD's
in-depth sector assessments of the wood products and pulp and
paper industries in Georgia. These reports are now available upon
request by calling Jancie Hatcher, P<sup>2</sup>AD's information
manager, at 404/651-5120 or 800/685-2443. Currently, the
fabricated metal products, printing industry, and rubber and
plastic products sector assessment reports are also nearing
completion. </p>
<p>As in the pulp and paper and wood products industries,
fabricated metal products (Standard Industrial Classification
3400 - 3499) companies are a significant contributor of toxic
emissions in Georgia. The sector report will identify common
processes that contribute to these wastestreams, successful
pollution prevention solutions undertaken in Georgia, technical
assistance resources that companies have used to help them
minimize waste, and impediments to pollution prevention. </p>
<p>According to the 1994 Georgia Manufacturing Directory, there
are over 800 fabricated metal products manufacturers with
approximately 28,000 employees in Georgia. Furthermore, the
economic and environmental impact on the state is even greater
when you consider that many companies in other SIC codes perform
metal fabrication tasks. Related sectors include the following: </p>
<p>SIC 2500, Furniture and Fixtures SIC 3500, Industrial and
Commercial Machinery and Computer Equipment SIC 3600, Electronic
and Other Electrical Equipment and Components SIC 3700,
Transportation Equipment SIC 3800, Measuring, Analyzing, and
Controlling Instruments SIC 3900, Miscellaneous Manufacturing
Industries </p>
<p>Within SIC 3400, Georgia companies fabricate metal cans and
containers, structural products, metal forgings and stampings,
hand tools, valves, and pipe among other items. Many also perform
coating, engraving, or allied services. The typical metal
fabrication plant is small with over 80% of the plants having 50
employees or less. Fabricated metal products plants are located
throughout the State with approximately one-third of the
companies located in the metropolitan Atlanta counties of Fulton,
DeKalb, Gwinnett, and Cobb. </p>
<p>In order to determine key issues within the sector, P<sup>2</sup>AD
researched existing pollution prevention literature and
compliance data. In addition, almost 10% of the fabricators were
surveyed in order to compare experiential data with the findings
outlined in relevant publications. From these sources, P<sup>2</sup>AD
was able to determine several key pollution prevention issues.
The following concerns were identified: </p>
<p>Waste generation from coatings application Waste generation
from surface preparation and cleaning Waste generation from metal
shaping processes Waste generation from metal plating operations
Lack of technical resources at facilities </p>
<p>For the first four issues, P<sup>2</sup>AD was able to
identify the types of waste generated, characteristics of the
processes generating these wastes, proven pollution prevention
options, and examples of companies in Georgia that have
successfully implemented at least one of the options. </p>
<p>Our research also indicated that companies with over 60
employees are two to three times more likely than others to have
undertaken certain pollution prevention measures including the
following: </p>
<p>Spill and leak prevention programs Process equipment changes
Process optimization Alternative product designs </p>
<p>In addition, small metal fabricators are less likely to
generate hazardous waste as many of them perform only assembly or
metal shaping functions and may not have painting or cleaning and
degreasing operations. This data is valuable to P<sup>2</sup>AD
in our efforts to ensure that our technical assistance is
structured to meet the needs of our clientele. </p>
<p>The paper concludes with a list of manufacturers' technical
and organizational needs that may prevent them from implementing
successful pollution prevention programs and initiatives.
Suggestions are made to effectively address these barriers to
pollution prevention. Like the wood products and pulp and paper
reports, the metal fabrication sector document will be reviewed
internally and by industry peers. It is anticipated that the
report will be available to the public this summer through P<sup>2</sup>AD's
information center. </p>

<h2 align="center">Southwire Holds Second Annual Pollution
Prevention Awards &amp; Workshop </h2>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring/Summer 1996]</p>
<hr>
<p>On Thursday, April 18th, Southwire Company held a pollution
prevention workshop and awards day to help increase the awareness
of pollution prevention and recognize employee efforts during the
past year. &quot;Our Pollution Prevention effort is critical to
expanding our business domestically and globally. We are
committed to a strategy of eliminating pollution and waste from
our manufacturing operations,&quot; said Win Hill, Director
Corporate Environmental Management. &quot;Each year we meet to
share our successes and recognize those who demonstrate
excellence in this effort.&quot; </p>
<p>The morning session was highlighted by presentations from
Steve Avary of Zep Manufacturing, and Tony Knick and Frank
Hollowell of Synthetic Industries, who shared their pollution
prevention / waste minimization success stories. Other
presentation topics were about waste cost accounting and ISO
14000 international environmental management standards. In the
afternoon, six Southwire facilities discussed their pollution
prevention implementation processes and results achieved to date.
Southwire established a corporate waste minimization / pollution
prevention program in 1994. The Southwire facilities then
implemented the program through the use of employee Corrective
Action Teams (CAT). For 1995, 15 Southwire facilities submitted
waste minimization reports to be evaluated for the awards day.
Criteria used to judge the reports included evidence of employee
involvement, wastestream assessment, evaluation of pollution
prevention options, technology transfer, and measurable results. </p>
<p>The six facilities selected as finalists were: Carrollton
Utility Products Plant and Carrollton Building Wire Plant,
Carrollton, Georgia; NSA, Hawesville, Kentucky; Southwire Company
Starkville Plant, Starkville, Mississippi; Southwire Specialty
Products, Osceola, Arkansas; and Southwire Machinery Division,
Carrollton, Georgia. After the six facility presentations,
Southwire presented 1995 CEO awards for pollution prevention.
Carrollton Building Wire Plant and NSA were selected for
Achievement Awards. The Excellence Award went to the Southwire
Machinery Division for their outstanding achievement in pollution
prevention. </p>
<p>Seventy Southwire managers representing all U.S. manufacturing
operations attended. Representatives from the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and the Georgia Environmental Protection
Division (EPD) were also in attendance. &quot;Today shows how
important recognition and awards are to inspiring employees to do
their best,&quot; said Bob Kerr, P<sup>2</sup>AD Director.
&quot;The effort extended by the Southwire plants and the results
obtained far exceeded the value of the awards. Congratulations to
all the participants for their outstanding efforts.&quot; </p>

<h2 align="center">Georgia Station Research and Education Garden
- Interpreting &quot;Green&quot; Research for the Horticultural
Industry and the Public </h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by S. Kristine Braman Associate
Professor Department of Entomology University of Georgia </strong></p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring/Summer 1996]</p>
<hr>
<p>The Georgia Station Research and Education Garden is part of
the Georgia Experiment Station. The Experiment Station has for a
century been one of the premier agricultural research centers in
the South. As one of three main campuses of the University of
Georgia Agricultural Experiment Station system (locations in
Athens, Griffin, and Tifton), it has made notable contributions
both to the applied and basic sciences. The station has ongoing
programs in agricultural economics, biological and agricultural
engineering, crop and soil sciences, entomology, horticulture,
plant pathology, and food science and technology. </p>
<p>The Garden is being developed to provide a forum for the
education of several audiences about the impact of ongoing
research programs of the University's College of Agricultural and
Environmental Sciences. The research and educational programs in
the Garden will be developed with input from the horticultural
industry and directed towards industry, gardener, professional
educator, and homeowner needs with emphasis on the interpretation
of ongoing research. The Garden consists of a gently rolling,
65-acre tract, located off Ellis Road in Griffin, Georgia, 40
miles south of Atlanta. The Garden site has excellent public
visibility and is easily accessible to clientele in central and
north Georgia. </p>
<p>The Concept Plan for the Garden retains the natural topography
as well as most of the existing vegetation. A 15-year old
Virginia pine seed orchard will be retained. The main entrance to
the Garden has been placed on Ellis Road (see map). Historical
trees from the Heritage Collection will line the drive and
research plots for pest management in hollies, turf, and
wildflowers along with various wildflower mixes will be visible.
A collection of native azalea species and other plant materials
in the ornamental plant breeding program can be viewed from the
drive. </p>
<p>Landscape management plots designed to reduce risks from urban
pesticide use have been included in the shaded plots.
Installation and management of these plots have been supported by
the Pollution Prevention Assistance Division of the Department of
Natural Resources. This project evolved from ongoing research
assessing the range of pest resistance in woody ornamentals and
turfgrasses and the effect of cultural conditions on insect pest
problems. This project includes the use of pest-resistant or
pest-susceptible plant materials grown with very limited use of
pesticides as compared to the use of pest-susceptible plant
materials grown under traditional chemical pest management. We
are also currently evaluating the influence of sun vs. shade as a
landscape management variable on plant quality and pest
susceptibility under reduced input management. Future studies in
this 10-year project will include the impact of other landscape
management practices, such as mulch, irrigation, and
fertilization on pest management. </p>
<p>At the highest point in the Garden, a visitors center with
meeting facilities for 150 people is planned. A wide variety of
educational opportunities will be accommodated in this facility
including meetings hosted by members of related professional
associations. A greenhouse range will enhance research and
educational opportunities offered in the Garden. The greenhouse
range will include the following: a polyethylene-covered house
comparable to those used by Georgia growers; a subdivided house
for pollution prevention research with runoff collection
facilities for each subunit; and an automated, subdivided house
for biological control research. </p>
<p>Demonstration plots will be planted near the visitors center.
Some of these will be former research plots dedicated to
demonstration of research results; others will be cultivar
collections (iris, daylily) or theme gardens (butterfly garden,
medicinal plant) prepared and maintained by volunteers from local
plant societies or Master Gardeners. A demonstration of lawn turf
cultivars will also be included. The Historic Garden, containing
a demonstration of new cultivar releases from the Georgia
Agricultural Experiment Stations, will be easily accessible from
the visitors center. </p>
<p>The Research and Education Garden is a good example of a
partnership among a variety of public and private groups. The
Georgia Station was able to take existing state and university
resources, and then leverage these resources to enable a number
of outstanding contributions from the private sector. </p>
<p>As mentioned above, initial funds from P<sup>2</sup>AD
supported initial research efforts and garden development.
Several Georgia trade associations then made substantial
contributions to the Garden. The Georgia Commercial Flower
Growers Association has assisted in development and purchase of
the first greenhouse for the Garden. The Georgia Irrigation
Association designed an irrigation plan for the demonstration
area and will provide materials for installation of the
irrigation mechanism. The Georgia Turfgrass Association and the
Georgia Sod Producers Association have donated sod for erosion
control research on the banks of the irrigation pond in the
Garden. Wholesale members of the Georgia Green Industry
Association have donated approximately 150 trees for planting in
the Garden, and Snapper, Inc. Of McDonough has provided about a
dozen pieces of lawn maintenance equipment. </p>
<p>Additionally, local contributions to the Garden have enabled
some exciting additions to the Garden. The Flint River Iris
Society is donating and installing the iris plants for the
demonstration plots, as well as making a monetary donation.
Similarly, the Flint River Daylily Society is donating and
installing day lilies for the Garden. Monetary donations have
also been received from the United Bank in Griffin, the Griffin
Federation of Garden Clubs, and the Redbud District Garden Clubs.
The detailed landscape design for the demonstration area was
donated by Master Gardeners Davie Biagi and Carolyn Fjeran.
Together, all of the contributors have provided a dynamic start
for the development of the Garden. </p>

<h2 align="center">Industry Recognition Program to Launch in
September </h2>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring/Summer 1996]</p>
<hr>
<p>P&#178;AD's <a href="p3intro.htm">Pollution Prevention
Partners (P&#179;) program</a> is expected to begin taking
applications from Georgia industry in September. The program is a
three level certification program that recognizes and rewards
continuous pollution prevention performance and improvement by
Georgia industries. Companies that qualify for the P&#179;
program demonstrate to their customers, employees, and community
a commitment to preventing pollution and waste, increasing
efficiency, and improving the environment. </p>
<p>&quot;We view the recognition program as an excellent
incentive for companies to reduce all of their waste
streams,&quot; said Harold Reheis, director of the Georgia
Environmental Protection Division. </p>
<p>&quot;The P&#179; program will recognize companies that are
doing a good job in reducing waste and encourage other companies
to start a pollution prevention program,&quot; said G. Robert
Kerr, director of the Pollution Prevention Assistance Division. </p>
<p>Companies that qualify for the P&#179; program and eligible
for public recognition and other incentives. Among the proposed
incentives is a reduction in certain fees paid to the Georgia
Environmental Protection Division. The fee portion of the program
must be approved by the Governor and General Assembly in 1997. As
companies improve their pollution prevention performance, the
level of recognition and value of the incentives increase.
Companies may qualify for three levels of recognition -- Entry,
Achievement and Model. </p>
<p>The <a href="entintro.htm">Entry Level</a> recognizes
facilities or plants that demonstrate a commitment to developing
a successful pollution prevention program. To qualify, facilities
must develop a pollution prevention plan with numeric reduction
goals. Facilities that qualify for the Entry Level are eligible
for recognition in P&#178;AD publications and will receive a
certificate. Entry Level Partners may apply for advancement to
the Achievement Level after one year. </p>
<p>The <a href="achintro.htm">Achievement Level</a> recognizes
facilities or plants that have established a pollution prevention
program and are making progress toward meeting reduction goals.
Facilities that qualify for and maintain the Achievement Level
will receive public recognition and up to a 10% reduction in
hazardous waste trust fund and Toxic Release Inventory fees paid
to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) for one
year. Facilities that continue to show progress toward meeting
pollution prevention goals may receive up to a 10% reduction in
fees in each of two additional years. The savings from these fees
must be allocated to pollution prevention activities at the
facility </p>
<p>The <a href="modintro.htm">Model Level</a> recognizes
facilities or plants that are industry leaders in pollution
prevention. Model Level facilities incorporate pollution
prevention into daily business activities, and have made
substantial progress toward meeting pollution prevention
reduction goals. Facilities that qualify for and maintain the
Model Level will receive public recognition and up to a 25%
reduction in hazardous waste trust fund and Toxic Release
Inventory fees paid to EPD for one year. Facilities that continue
to show progress toward meeting pollution prevention goals may
receive up to a 25% reduction in fees in each of two additional
years. The savings from the fees must be allocated to pollution
prevention activities at the facility. </p>
<p>The program will undergo a public comment period from June 15
to July 15. Applications will be available through P&#178;AD on
September 15. </p>

<hr>
<p>In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed an executive order
titled &quot;Federal Actions to Address Environmental justice in
Minority Populations and Low-income Populations&quot;. According
to Robert Bullard of Clark Atlanta University, an expert in the
field of environmental justice, one effective way to improve the
health and safety of neighbors living in industrialized areas is
through an industry commitment to pollution prevention. In
Georgia, the City of Atlanta, Clark Atlanta University, and the
Pollution Prevention Assistance Division (P<sup>2</sup>AD) have
teamed up to develop and implement the Neighborhood Environmental
Partnership to improve the quality of life in low income minority
neighborhoods in industrialized areas of Atlanta. </p>
<p>Through this partnership, a pilot study will be established in
Atlanta to encourage local industries to implement pollution
prevention into their operations and to provide a vehicle for
community outreach. This will be accomplished by contacting
company managers through the mail and by phone to inform them
about the project. Workshops will be held for interested
businesses on pollution prevention and outreach techniques.
Likewise the communities within the pilot area will be contacted
to participate in the outreach component of the study. </p>
<p>This concept is not new. For example, the chemical industry
has learned that a poor public image can negatively impact
business. As a result, the Responsible Care program was
instituted by the Chemical Manufacturers Association to address
environmental concerns. The program has six codes which a company
must fulfill in order to participate in the Association.
Pollution prevention and community awareness are two of the six
codes. This program has significantly improved the image of
chemical manufacturers. The textile industry has developed a
similar program. Closer to home, P<sup>2</sup>AD has incorporated
community outreach into its three level certification program
which recognizes companies for pollution prevention initiatives.
In order to achieve the highest level, a company must do
community outreach. More and more companies are opting to
&quot;go green&quot; because it improves their image, the bottom
line, and the surrounding environment. </p>
<p>For more information about the Neighborhood Environmental
Partnership, please contact Susan Varlamoff at (404) 657-5208, or
Marilyn Johnson, City of Atlanta, at (404) 330-6755.</p>

<hr>
<p>This issue of Pollution Solutions is focused on household
hazardous waste. The City of Alpharetta began accepting
batteries, lamps, and ballasts from residents in January 1996. To
date, the Alpharetta 2-4-8 Household Hazardous Waste Collection
and Recycling program has collected 3,564 household batteries, 47
fluorescent tubes, and 7 ballasts from over 200 people. The
average person drops off 21 batteries. One participant drove over
40 miles one-way to drop off batteries. The next step is to move
towards a daily collection so that the program can better respond
to the citizen's needs. </p>
<p>The collection is open one Saturday a month for the citizens
of Alpharetta. Residents outside the city may bring their items
to the collection for a small fee. For more information, please
contact Dee West at (770) 410-5835. </p>

<p><a name="Introduction "><strong>Introduction</strong> </a></p>
<p>The purpose of this report is to identify the specific causes
of waste generation, and cost-effective solutions that will
reduce waste in the pulp and paper industry in Georgia. The
benefits of reducing waste are reduced pollution and decreased
operating cost to the business. Releases of high-priority toxic
chemicals are the primary focus of this report but other
significant solid and liquid wastes will be included. Barriers
exist that limit the implementation of pollution prevention
projects and technologies. Barriers and strategies to overcome
them will also be discussed in this report. </p>
<p><a name="Methodology"><strong>Methodology</strong></a> </p>
<p>Review of trade and environmental publications indicated that
the processes responsible for Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)
releases in this sector are primarily Kraft pulping and bleaching
of pulp. Businesses that use these processes were identified by
reviewing 1993 TRI reports and the Georgia Manufacturing
Directory. There are relatively few pulp and paper mills in
Georgia. Telephone interviews were conducted of Kraft pulp mills
and paper mills in the state. Visits were made to six mills;
various processes related to Kraft pulping, bleaching, and
recycling were reviewed. The interviews and plant visits were
conducted to collect information on the various types of
equipment and chemistries used in the mills. Water usage, pulp
production, and information on various other wastes were
collected. Mill environmental and production staffs were also
questioned about programs at their facilities to reduce waste and
evaluate new technologies available to the pulp and paper
industry. The results of this study are presented in this
document. </p>
<p><a name="Summary"><strong>Summary</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The following key issues were identified as a result of this
study through contacts with Georgia pulp mill personnel, mill
tours, interviews with paper industry experts, and review of
various trade and environmental publications. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Lack of Facility Pollution Prevention Programs </li>
    <li>Water Use Reduction and Reuse </li>
    <li>Lime Mud Waste Reduction </li>
    <li>Energy Conservation and Recovery </li>
    <li>Alternatives to Chlorine Bleaching </li>
    <li>Log Yard Waste Reduction</li>
</ul>
<p>The Georgia Pollution Prevention Assistance Division (P<sup>2</sup>AD)
will assist Georgia pulp and paper manufacturers in addressing
these key issues by developing various programs. P<sup>2</sup>AD
will work with existing technical and business organizations to
provide training, publication of fact sheets and case studies,
and conduct applied research demonstration projects in order to
address critical pollution prevention issues. </p>

<h3><a name="Profile"><strong>Profile of the Pulp and Paper
Manufacturing Sector in Georgia</strong></a> </h3>
<p>Georgia pulp manufacturers produce pulp, bleached pulp, or
specialty pulp for the food and pharmaceutical industry. Many of
these companies also produce finished paper, paperboard, or
linerboard. Twenty-four companies are listed in the Georgia
Manufacturers Directory within SIC code 26 that are predominately
involved in cellulose pulp manufacturing. Approximately 13,000
people work for these manufacturers. A list of these businesses
is provided below in Table 1 with a description of the primary
products and number of employees. </p>

<p>Of the 24 manufacturers in Georgia, thirteen are large
manufacturers of pulp only, pulp and paper, or pulp and
linerboard. These manufacturers produce virgin pulp and form a
finished paper product. The pulp may be either bleached or
unbleached. Four Georgia mills produce bleached virgin pulp. Pulp
is also sold to paper manufacturers that make paper, filter
paper, or other specialty paper from pulp. There are
approximately 100 companies in Georgia that are primarily paper,
paperboard, or paper products manufacturers that do not
manufacture pulp. These companies are not the focus of this
study. </p>
<p>Another manufacturing group repulps old corrugated cardboard,
linerboard, newsprint, and other waste paper. There are at least
nine mills producing recycled pulp in Georgia. Recycling mills
manufacture pulp for sale to other industries or manufacture a
finished paper product. Some recycling mills deink printed stock
using floatation or continuous deinking. Bleaching is done
primarily with peroxide and less with sodium hypochlorite by
recyclers. At least one company recycles newsprint and other
paper in a dry repulping process to make insulation, animal
bedding, and reseeding material used on highway right of ways. </p>
<p>Paper mills need a source of water and a receiving body to
dispose of wastewater. Paper mills are generally located near a
river to provide a means of disposal for the often tremendous
wastewater stream generated by the mill. A secondary reason is to
provide water for mill usage since a number of mills use wells as
the primary source of mill supply water. Cooling water is also
needed and is usually supplied from surface water. All Georgia
mills have wastewater treatment plants except some of the small
specialty product mills, and dispose of wastewater directly to a
river after treatment. At least one mill disposes of wastewater
to a municipal treatment system. Several mills also purchase
water from a city or other source of treated water. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Processes"><strong>Pulp and Paper Industrial
Processes</strong></a><strong> </strong></h3>
<p>In order to understand the pulp and paper industry, a general
description of the pulping and paper making process is needed.
Each of the companies uses some or all of these processes. </p>
<p><strong>Wood Yard Operations</strong> </p>
<p>Wood is delivered to a pulp mill either as logs or chips. Logs
are delivered with the bark attached to prevent loss of moisture
and other degradation. Logs are handled in the yard by cranes or
log trucks. They are loaded onto a conveyor or log flume where
they are carried to a debarker and chipper. Chips are screened to
remove over and undersized chips, and then stored in the yard
awaiting digestion. The majority of the Georgia virgin pulp mills
have wood yards. A growing trend is to eliminate wood yards and
receive chipped wood only. Several mills receive only wood chips
or are planning wood yard closure in the near future. </p>
<p><strong>Water Treatment </strong></p>
<p>Pulp mills generally require a large amount of water in
processing to remove lignin and bleaching byproducts. Water is
generally obtained from rivers or wells. From 5,000 to 40,000
gallons of water is required to produce one ton of dry pulp in
Georgia's virgin pulp mills. This water is treated prior to use
to remove suspended solids and other contaminants. </p>
<p><strong>Digestion </strong></p>
<p>Chips are heated by steam and white liquor is added. The
liquor impregnated chips then enter the digester where they are
heated to cooking temperature. Spent cooking liquor or black
liquor is removed from the brownstock after cooking. In batch
digesters, the brownstock is blown from the bottom of the
digester vessel prior to washing. In a continuous digester,
washing takes place inside the digester to remove liquor and cool
the pulp. In either case, brownstock is washed to remove the
majority of spent liquor. It is also screened to remove
undigested knots. The majority of the 13 pulp mills use the Kraft
process. One mill uses the thermo-mechanical pulping process. </p>
<p><strong>Washing</strong> </p>
<p>Pulp washing takes place after each major process. The purpose
of washing is to remove undesirable elements from the pulp
stream. Black liquor, fines, lignin, and bleach byproducts are
removed after each processing step. Washer efficiency can be
measured by the cleanliness of the pulp and the amount of water
used to achieve that level of cleanliness. There are a number of
different types of washers available. Vacuum drum brownstock
washers (six-stage or three-stage) were the industry standards up
to the 1970s. At least six Georgia mills currently use vacuum
drum washers. Pressure brownstock washers represent a later
washing technology with at least one mill using this technology.
Diffusion brownstock washers are currently the industry
standards, but diffusion washers are also being improved upon.
Diffusion washers are used by at least three mills. At least two
pulp mills in Georgia use Chemi washers, which are the most
efficient washers available currently. Each improvement
represents cleaner pulp with a water usage reduction. </p>
<p><strong>Refining</strong> </p>
<p>Pulp passes through slots in rotating plates to separate the
cellulose clumps into fibers and condition the fibers for paper
making. Essentially, the fibers are cut to a uniform length
during refining which reduces strength. The fibers are also
conditioned by refining which improves bonding and strength of
the finished paper product. </p>
<p><strong>Oxygen Delignification</strong> </p>
<p>Some mills have installed an oxygen stage to further remove
lignin from the brownstock as a prebleaching step. Reduced lignin
content produces a whiter pulp. Oxygen and white liquor are added
to the brownstock in a heated reactor where additional
delignification takes place. Lignin compounds freed as a result
of oxygen delignification are removed in washing and extraction
stages. At least two Georgia mills use oxygen delignification.
Oxygen delignification reduces the amount of chlorine or other
bleaching chemicals required to whiten the pulp in the bleach
stage. </p>
<p><strong>Extended Delignification </strong></p>
<p>Various extended delignification techniques are used to remove
more lignin prior to bleaching. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and heat
act to break complex bonds in the lignin to make them soluble in
water or volatile. NaOH and heat also break bonds in the
cellulose reducing strength and yield. Extended delignification
techniques cook the wood chips at lower temperature for longer
periods of time to remove lignin with reduced damage to the
cellulose. Several techniques are in use to control temperature
and liquor chemistry in the digester. At least four mills in
Georgia use extended delignification. Extended delignification
reduces the amount of bleaching chemicals required in the
bleaching stage to produce the same pulp whiteness. </p>
<p><strong>Bleaching </strong></p>
<p>Bleaching usually takes place in a multistage process. The
purpose of bleaching is to remove lignin without damaging the
cellulose. One process is the DED process; D represents chlorine
dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>) and E represents extraction. In this
process, brownstock is mixed with ClO<sub>2</sub> in the D1
reactor which further reacts with lignin in the pulp. Washing
follows to remove the chlorinated lignin compounds from the pulp.
NaOH is added to the pulp stream in the E tower and is followed
by washing in a press. Extraction neutralizes the pulp and
improves subsequent washing. The D2 tower is the last stage of
bleaching where ClO<sub>2</sub> provides the final whitening of
the pulp. If preceded by oxygen delignification, the process is
abbreviated ODED. Chlorine (C), peroxide (P), oxygen (O), sodium
hypochlorite (H), and ozone (Z) are other chemicals that can be
used in various configurations. For example, ODEoD would consist
of: </p>
<p align="center"><em>oxygen reactor &gt; ClO</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em>
reactor &gt; extraction with oxygen added (EO) &gt; ClO</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em>
reactor</em> </p>
<p>The final stage of bleaching is often used to whiten or
lighten remaining lignin. Eight Georgia mills bleach pulp in some
manner, four of which are virgin pulp mills. </p>
<p><strong>Paper Making</strong> </p>
<p>The pulp is then transported to the paper machine where a pulp
mat is formed on a screen. Water is removed from the sheet by a
combination of vacuum, heat, and pressure applied through
rollers. The finished paper can be made in a variety of weights
and is rolled onto large rollers for shipment to other processing
plants. Paper is sometimes coated on the paper machine with
kaolin to provide a white surface or has a binder added to
increase wet strength. Some binders contain formaldehyde; many
companies have replaced these with nonformaldehyde binders. Other
coatings and binders contain ammonia or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA).
Approximately 17 mills in Georgia produce paper, paperboard, or
similar products. </p>
<p><strong>Power Boiler </strong></p>
<p>Energy in the form of heat and steam is generated by burning
waste wood from the log yard or fossil fuels. In addition to
steam, electricity is also often generated on-site at pulp mills.
Pulp and paper mills require a large amount of energy to operate. </p>
<p><strong>Liquor Recovery Cycle</strong> </p>
<p>NaOH and sodium sulfide (Na<sub>2</sub>S) are the primary
pulping chemicals. NaOH reacts with lignin in the wood to release
the cellulose fiber. Na<sub>2</sub>S buffers the reaction to keep
the solution caustic, and aids in the removal of digested lignin
by increasing its solubility. Spent cooking liquor, or black
liquor contains various organic and sulfur compounds in addition
to the reactive pulping components of NaOH and Na<sub>2</sub>S.
The black liquor is removed from the pulp at various locations
after the delignification process and concentrated in an
evaporator. The concentrated liquor, or strong black liquor is
combusted in a furnace along with sodium sulfate (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)
to recover Na<sub>2</sub>S, and sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>)
in the form of ash. This ash is mixed with water and lime (CaO).
The resultant reaction forms green liquor and replenishes the
original pulping chemicals NaOH and Na<sub>2</sub>S; calcium
carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>). CaCO<sub>3</sub> is precipitated
from the green liquor in a clarifier and converted back to CaO in
a lime kiln. After removal of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, the green liquor
becomes white liquor. The recovery cycle consists of a liquor
evaporator, recovery boiler, clarifier, and lime kiln. </p>
<p><strong>Wastewater Treatment</strong> </p>
<p>Wastewater gathered from various mill processes is treated
prior to discharge to reduce biological oxygen demand (BOD),
chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total suspended solids (TSS).
Wastewater typically passes through a primary clarifier to remove
the bulk of the cellulose fibers lost during processing and other
solids. Wastewater then passes through aeration ponds to further
reduce BOD and COD. Nutrients in the form of ammonium nitrate or
ammonia are often added to encourage microbe activity. Wastewater
is then discharged directly to a river or tidal river. Wastewater
volumes are very large ranging up to 40,000,000 gallons per day
with relatively low contaminant concentrations. In addition to
BOD, COD, and TSS, color and chlorinated compounds such as dioxin
have been of great concern to pulp mills. Aeration and
clarification do not significantly reduce color or chlorinated
compounds. </p>
<p><strong>Waste Paper Recycling</strong> </p>
<p>Another segment of the industry repulps cardboard or newsprint
into recycled paper or paperboard. Recycled material is repulped
by adding water, sodium hydroxide, and heat. The pulp is then
made into a finished paper product on a paper machine in the same
manner as a virgin paper mill. Deinking and bleaching are also
done at some recycle mills. Floatation is one common method of
deinking. Peroxide is commonly used in the bleaching process.
Approximately nine Georgia mills are involved in repulping waste
paper products. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Characteristics">Waste Stream and Generation
Characteristics of Georgia Pulp and Paper Manufacturers</a> </h3>
<p>Wastes are generated by the industrial processes used by
Georgia pulp and paper manufacturers. Almost all of the wastes
generated are derived from unusable portions of the tree such as
bark and lignin. Additional wastes are generated from power
generation or from the chemicals used in pulping, bleaching, and
chemical recovery. Energy is also a waste stream. Water entering
the mill is heated for process use. Thermal energy is emitted to
the environment from numerous sources. </p>
<p>The usable portion of a tree is cellulose from which paper is
made. Other materials such as turpentine are byproducts which
have a market value. Most other components are released to the
environment as solid waste, liquids, gasses, or energy derived
from combustion. </p>
<p><strong>Toxic Wastes</strong> </p>
<p>Toxic wastes reported on the 1993 TRI totaled more than 18.8
million pounds of which 16.4 million pounds were released to the
air. TRI releases for 1993 are shown in Figure 2. Of the 26
chemicals reported, methanol was released in the largest quantity
at approximately 9.3 million pounds. Methanol is generated from
pulping at the rate of 12 to 20 pounds per ton of production in
the Kraft process. Bleaching can increase that amount up to 25
pounds. Thermo-mechanical pulping also releases methanol, but in
much lower quantities at about 0.5 pounds per ton of pulp.
Methanol and other organics (MEK, acetone, etc.) are released
primarily from process vents, but are also found in wastewater
and the recovery furnace stack. Wastewater leaving the mill can
contain large amounts of the methanal; biological destruction of
methanol is estimated to be in excess of 99% in wastewater
treatment plants. Non-contact recovery boilers available since
the 1970s reduce methanol stack releases to near zero. Newer and
modernized facilities collect and combust process vent gasses in
the recovery boiler, lime kiln, or power boiler furnaces reducing
methanol and sulfur releases. Older facilities still have
uncontrolled process vents releasing significant amounts of
methanol. </p>
<p>Noncondensable gasses are usually burned in the lime kiln or
recovery boiler. Mills have traditionally avoided burning
noncondensable gasses in the recovery boiler due to an increased
risk of an explosion. Some mills have lime kilns which cannot
meet the capacity required to burn all noncondensable gasses, or
have significant downtime due to mechanical failures. The result
is increased emissions of sulfur and organics when the kilns are
used to combust noncondensable gasses. Burning noncondensable
gasses in the kiln also decreases the lime recovery capacity,
thus increasing solid waste in the form of disposed lime mud. A
few mills have begun to burn noncondensable gasses in recovery
furnaces to take advantage of their greater capacity. </p>
<p>Sulfuric and hydrochloric acids are also released by pulp
mills. These materials are combustion byproducts from coal-fired
boiler operations. Sulfuric acid is also used in paper making and
other mill processes to adjust pH. Zinc is another material
reported that is nonpulp related. Zinc is contained in ash from
burning tires as a boiler fuel. Tire burning for energy recovery
is a popular tire recycling or disposal method. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>FIGURE 2 - 1993 GEORGIA TRI RELEASES BY
PULP AND PAPER MANUFACTURERS IN POUNDS</strong></p>
<p align="center"><img src="pulp1.gif" width="447" height="280"></p>
<p>Chlorinated compounds such as chloroform are emitted from
wastewater and bleach plant process vents. Chloroform is
primarily associated with the use of sodium hypochlorite and
chlorine bleaching. Mills generally have replaced both of these
materials to some degree. Hypochlorite use is discontinuing.
Chlorine is being replaced either partially or fully by chlorine
dioxide. Ozone is also used in place of chlorine on a limited
basis in other states. For these reasons, chloroform emissions
have decreased. Dioxin is another chlorine related pollutant.
Dioxin levels in effluent from mills that have switched to 100%
chlorine dioxide are usually below detectable levels. Chlorine
dioxide has replaced chlorine completely, 100% substitution, in
three Georgia mills. Several other mills have replaced 20% to 30%
of the chlorine used for bleaching with chlorine dioxide. </p>
<p>Chromium and dichloromethane are two chemicals reported from
Georgia mills on the 1993 TRI. These are nonpulp related and are
due to specific situations that occurred at particular mills. </p>
<p><strong>Solid Waste</strong> </p>
<p>Solid waste generation by pulp and paper manufacturers varies
between 0.01 and 0.26 tons of waste per ton of product (TPT). The
wide diversity is due to several factors. Lime mud and wood yard
debris can be large solid waste streams. The sources of these
wastes are log handling and insufficient capacity lime kilns.
Some mills have sufficient lime kiln capacity and thus produce
small amounts of waste. Other mills have reduced wood yard waste
by purchasing wood chips and eliminating log storage. Other solid
wastes typical in pulp mills are wastewater treatment sludge and
digester knots. Sludge and knots are reused in some mills and
disposed of in others. </p>
<p>Solid waste is usually disposed of in on-site landfills; some
mills use municipal or private landfills. Disposal costs are
often very high, exceeding $2 million annually in some mills
whether on-site or off-site. Some municipal landfills used by
pulp mills have closed. As on-site landfills reach capacity,
several mills are considering building new landfills. New
landfills can cost $10 to $20 million to open and are not an
attractive option to most pulp mills. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Wood Yard Waste </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Wood yard waste generation by Georgia pulp and paper
manufacturers varies between 0.02 and 0.06 TPT. Oversized logs,
wood debris, decayed wood, sand, soil, and bark are typical
wastes. Wood waste can be burned in power boilers if soil and
sand are removed. Much of this material is landfilled, or used in
the landfill as cover material. Wood chips that are burned for
energy are still considered waste by most mills if originally
intended for pulping. Several mills indicated that wood yard
waste was the largest solid waste stream from their facilities. </p>
<p>Chip making also generates some wood waste. Knots and
undersized chips are removed from the chip screen. These
materials, along with bark, are usually used as fuel. Clean,
palm-sized bark chunks have a high market value as a landscaping
material. Some mills sell bark for landscaping. Sawmills and
other bark sources that traditionally sold this material to pulp
mills for fuel have diverted the landscaping suitable bark to
other markets. The smaller, dirtier bark is sold to mills for
fuel use. Soil and other debris in this bark must be removed
prior to burning or after as increased ash volume, thus creating
additional waste. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sludge </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Various mill sludges are also disposed of as solid waste but
are derived from wastewater treatment systems. Primary and
secondary clarifier sludges consist of dirt, debris, and
cellulose. This material is intentionally rejected due to being
out of specification or accidentally due to inherent
inefficiencies in the pulp washing systems. At each washing or
refining stage, some usable pulp is lost even after passing
though save-alls. Deinking sludges are generated from recycling
plants and consist of inks, clays, soils, and some cellulose
fiber. Mills sometimes dry and burn the sludges for energy
recovery and volume reduction. Deinking sludge will have
approximately 50% of the energy value of bark. Sludges are
sometimes applied to forest or farm land partially as a disposal
method and partially to recover nutrients. Sludge generation is
reported to be 0.02 to 0.06 TPT. Some pulp mills indicated that
improvements have been made in reducing the amount of cellulose
inadvertently sent to wastewater treatment. As the cellulose
content in sludge is reduced, sludge volume decreases. The sludge
generated is then less useful for traditional recycling options
such as reuse in ceiling tile manufacture or as fuel. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ash</strong><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>Ash is generated due to combustion. Coal, bark, wood, tires,
and sludge are burned producing varying amounts of ash due in
part to the amount of noncombustibles in the materials. Ash is
disposed of in landfills or has some limited reuse. Wood and bark
ash are sometimes used agriculturally for their liming potential.
Ash generation rates are approximately 0.04 TPT from Georgia pulp
mills. Ashes from different fuels will have varying metal
content. Ash from burning tires will contain zinc. Some pulp
mills in Georgia burn only wood and bark; other mills primarily
burn some mixture of coal, wood, fuel oil, or natural gas. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lime Mud </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Lime mud is also disposed of as a solid waste. Pulp mills have
lime kilns for regenerating lime mud from the liquor recovery
process. Often lime kiln capacity does not meet mill requirement,
thus requiring disposal of lime mud and purchase of fresh lime.
Waste lime mud generation is only related to kiln capacity, not
production. Waste lime mud generation of up to 200 tons per day
is reported. Other lime related wastes are green liquor dregs and
slaker grits in relatively low volumes. Burning of noncondensable
gasses in lime kilns can also increase the volume of grits and
dregs generated. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Undigested Knots</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Knots generated in the digester and are resin-loaded pieces of
wood that are not fully digestible due to poor impregnation with
cooking liquor and high lignin content. This material is
separated from digested pulp in various screening operations.
Some mills mechanically break the knots down and reintroduce them
to the digester or pulp stream. Other mills dispose of knots as a
solid waste or burn for energy recovery. Undigested knots also
contain black liquor and are a source of air emissions. </p>
<p><strong>Wastewater</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Process Wastewater </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Water is the largest raw material input in the pulp and paper
industry. Georgia integrated brownstock mills will use 5,000 to
12,000 gallons per ton of production. Bleached pulp mills in
Georgia have water usages ranging from 13,000 to 25,000 gallons
per ton; approximately 50% is used in the bleaching process.
Specialty pulp mills can approach 40,000 gallons per ton. Recycle
mills also use a considerable amount of water. The lowest water
usage noted during this study was 810 gallons per ton at
Sweetwater Paper Board, a corrugated recycling mill located in
Austell, Georgia. The highest usage was over 17,000 gallons per
ton in a recycling mill with deinking processes and bleaching. </p>
<p>Wastewater as previously discussed can contain methanol,
chlorinated compounds, cellulose, and other materials. Wastewater
removes undesirable material from the process and carries them to
a treatment system to partially concentrate and remove,
stabilize, or destroy those materials that could damage the
environment prior to releasing the water. Wastewater is generated
in every washing stage, as well as in the woodyard and chemical
generation. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Storm Water </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Storm water may be affected by chipping dust that escapes as
fugitive releases from the chipper or chip piles. Bark, debarking
dust, and other woody debris are lost around the edges of
woodyards. This material was obviously present on the ground
around some manufacturing plants visited. Storm water
contamination with wood dust is not likely to cause long term
problems such as ground water contamination, but can prompt
complaints from neighbors, block storm drains, and foul standing
water. Storm water runoff is often captured and treated. Wood
yard areas and areas where pulp or pulping chemicals are spilled
do contribute to storm water pollution and increased treatment
costs. Mills typically collect and treat storm water from outside
production and storage areas. Increased BOD is the primary storm
water pollutant. </p>
<p><strong>Hazardous Waste</strong> </p>
<p>Hazardous waste is generated by pulp mills but not in large
quantities. Maintenance wastes from degreasing and painting are
typical waste sources. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Barriers ">Pollution Prevention Barriers </a></h3>
<p><strong>Economic Barriers</strong> </p>
<p>The greatest barrier to pollution prevention in the pulp and
paper industry is economic. A pulp mill is a large scale, mostly
in-line production process composed of large and expensive
devices. In-line production means that all of the product passes
through each process component. If one piece fails, then the
entire mill ceases to function. There are exceptions. Older mills
tend to have many batch digesters while newer and upgraded mills
use one or two continuous digesters. Process change becomes
riskier as mills move more to in-line production. </p>
<p>A large integrated pulp mill producing 2,000 tons per day of
product will cost almost $1 billion to construct if built today.
Recovery boilers can cost up to $100 million for new
installations. In addition to expensive equipment, the product is
very expensive. Virgin bleached pulp prices have been in excess
of $1,000 per ton. Upgrades to a pulp mill could require many
weeks of construction. A single week of downtime could cost $14
million in lost sales. For these reasons, changes in technology
are not implemented until the risk of failure is very low and
economic payback high. </p>
<p>Newer pulping technologies are definitely more efficient that
older technologies. Due to the cost of equipment and upgrades, it
is difficult to justify major changes or replacement of entire
systems until the working life of existing equipment has been
reached. </p>
<p><strong>Technological Barriers</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Kraft Pulping</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>The Kraft process is the leading pulping technology in
Georgia. Mechanical pulping is used at one mill. Kraft pulping in
many ways has remained unchanged; wood, water, energy, NaOH, and
Na<sub>2</sub>S are the traditional process inputs. Wastes
generated are methanol and other various organic chemicals, solid
waste, wastewater, sulfur compounds, and waste heat. Reduction in
pollution has resulted primarily from pollution control measures
such as combustion of vented gasses and scrubbing combustion
stack gasses. Equipment modification to improve boiler combustion
efficiency has also reduced emissions. Pollution prevention
techniques have resulted in improved recovery of NaOH and Na<sub>2</sub>S,
reduced water usage, and reduced energy usage. Even with these
improvements, the Kraft pulping process will continue to produce
organic waste. Environmental pollution reduction from the Kraft
process will continue to be primarily capture and control since
there are few if any methods available for eliminating pollution
at the source. Use of catalysts and enzymes in pulping represents
the first new technology changes in many years. Catalysts are
discussed later in the report under Alternatives to Chlorine
Bleaching. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bleaching and Pulp Washing</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, pulp washing and bleaching are continuing
to change to reduce waste. Economic barriers and some technical
barriers still exist in implementing pollution prevention
technologies in bleaching and pulp washing, but there appears to
be a steady evolution of these processes to reduce waste and
cost. </p>
<p>Technological evolution in bleaching is evident by reviewing
the existing bleaching technologies in 1995 compared to 1970.
Bleaching began almost exclusively using chlorine and sodium
hypochlorite. Due initially to dioxin concerns in the 1980s,
alternatives to chlorine were researched and implemented.
Chlorine dioxide has now either totally or partially replaced
elemental chlorine and sodium hypochlorite. Oxygen and peroxide
are also now used in bleaching and prebleaching stages. In
addition, various methods to improve delignification in the
pulping stage have been developed which reduce the dependence
upon chlorine in bleaching. </p>
<p><strong>Organizational Barriers</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lack of Pollution Prevention Programs</strong><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>The typical pulp or paper mill in Georgia does not have a
program in place to evaluate wastes and develop methods of
reducing. The primary focus of pulp mill personnel is to keep the
mill in production by meeting quality, production, and
environmental regulatory mandates. Mill personnel are extremely
busy; tasks beyond the normal scope of work are commonly handled
by using consultants. Pulp and paper mills use external
consultants for environmental and design services. Through
organizations such as the Technical Association of the Pulp and
Paper Industry (TAPPI), the National Council of the Paper
Industry for Air and Stream Improvement (NCASI), the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other pulp and paper
trade associations, technologies that improve environmental
performance are well known to both mill personnel and
consultants. For this reason, new mills are constructed with
leading edge technologies; many older mills have also upgraded.
Several pulp and paper manufacturers have corporate programs to
reduce waste. In general, these programs are designed to identify
and evaluate those leading edge technologies. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lack of Waste Accounting</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the more mundane aspects of waste minimization and
pollution prevention are overlooked. Mills have various means of
accounting for waste generation, but these methods mostly focus
on major waste steams. Ash generation, sludge generation, solid
waste generation, and overall water usage are known. Specific
sources of waste and water usage are unknown. Georgia pulp mills
generally account for waste generation and cost as overhead. Most
mills have not attempted to trace waste generation back to
individual processes. In some of the mills, water usage was only
known as a total volume. Flows to individual processes, and waste
materials contributed to the wastewater stream by individual
processes are unknown. Approximately 50% of the Georgia pulp
mills have formal pollution prevent plans to evaluate waste and
implement waste minimization methods. Even the mills with formal
pollution prevention programs tend to look toward the
technological solutions and not the simpler methods such as
materials management. The simpler methods often require a
significant investment of time to develop and implement, but can
have very large financial returns. </p>
<p>Air emissions by pulp and paper mills are calculated using
emission factors or they are measured. Emissions factors provide
an estimate of the amount of a chemical emitted per ton of pulp
production. Emission factors are based on the type of equipment
used to produce pulp. For example, the emissions factor for
estimating methanol emissions from a batch digester and blow tank
will be greater than the emissions factor for a continuous
digester on a per ton basis. NCASI, EPA, and other organizations
publish emissions factors. Emissions calculated by using
emissions factors may be higher or lower than measured values
depending upon a number of factors. The general state of repair
of equipment can also affect emissions; additional emissions due
to failures may not be calculated when using emissions factors
according to some mill personnel. In one facility, the pulp
washer appeared to have some seal damage in an access door
emitting steam, liquid, and odor. Other mills had darkly colored
liquid streams escaping from pulp washers and storage areas. In
every case, the liquid was collected in sewers for treatment at
the mill's treatment plant. Air emissions from these failures may
not be estimated by using emission factors according to some pulp
mill personnel. The use of emission factors does not seem to
provide an incentive for repair of relatively minor system leaks
such as these. Measurement of emissions may not provide an
incentive either since emissions from leaks or failures would be
only measured if sensors were located in close proximity or were
intentionally measured. Leaks from equipment in disrepair do
increase operating cost and actual emissions. Preventive
maintenance and leak repair should be included in all pulp mill
procedures. Mills that have few leaks, few spills, and maintain a
high level of housekeeping may release fewer air emissions than
mills that do not maintain equipment or housekeeping as well.
However, reported emissions for the two situations may be the
same based on stack measurements or emissions factors. </p>

offers the use of a 20 ton per day pulp mill for research of
ozone, chlorine free, enzyme assisted, and other bleaching and
deinking technologies. </p>
<p><strong>Corporate and Facility Pollution Prevention Programs </strong></p>
<p>Several of the Georgia mills use their corporate engineering
and technical resources to reduce waste. Other plants have mill
personnel who measure and characterize waste streams with the
goal of reducing waste. Whether using corporate or plant
personnel, some mills actively track waste generation to the
source and seek ways to reduce. A case study is attached in
Appendix I describing Weyerhaeuser's approach to waste
minimization. Tenneco, Weyerhaeuser, Georgia-Pacific, Fort
Howard, Southeast, Federal, Gilman, and Rayonier are some of the
major pulp and paper manufacturers in Georgia with waste
minimization programs. In each case, the specific goals and
methods may be very different depending upon the organization. </p>

<h3><a name="Key">Key Pollution Prevention Issues</a> </h3>
<p>The following key issues were identified through contacts with
Georgia pulp mill personnel, mill tours, interviews with paper
industry experts, and review of various trade and environmental
publications. </p>

    <li>Lack of Facility Pollution Prevention Programs </li>
    <li>Water Use Reduction and Reuse </li>

</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Facility"><strong>Lack of Facility Pollution
Prevention Programs</strong></a><strong> </strong></h3>
<p>A number of mills do have formal pollution prevention plans
while others do not. Some of the mills are part of wider
corporate pollution prevention plans. The goals and methods used
are different for each program. Regardless of goals and methods
used, the plans should all include waste audits that track waste
streams back to the source and estimate total costs associated
with the waste streams. Once costs are known, specific projects
can be identified that can be justified for their cost reduction
potential. Discussions with plant and corporate personnel
indicated that many of the plans do not include this basic
requirement. </p>
<p>Some of the plans were directed toward long-term technology
goals such as zero discharge of wastewater or total chlorine free
bleaching. These goals are necessary, but may be realized in 10
or more years. All current paper making technologies will not be
replaced with long-term technology changes. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Water"><strong>Water Use Reduction and Reuse</strong></a> </h3>
<p>Water is used by all pulp, paper, and recycling mills in
significant quantity. There are a number of processes which use
water and generate waste water, but the primary uses are pulp
washing following digestion and bleaching, and deinking and
washing in recycling mills. Since most water used by a pulp mill
is heated prior to use, reducing water usage can very
significantly reduce energy usage. Energy costs and savings are
often the most significant aspects of water usage reduction
programs. </p>
<p><strong>Brownstock Washing </strong></p>
<p>Pulp washing is usually done in either of four washing
systems, vacuum drum, pressure, diffusion, or Chemi. A brief
description of each is provided below. Washing is done to remove
cooking chemicals and to remove lignin breakdown byproducts as a
prerequisite to pulp drying, bleaching, and paper making. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vacuum Drum Washing</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Vacuum drum washers usually consist of three to six
counter-flow stages. Each stage consists of a rotating screen
drum which has a partial vacuum applied to the interior. The drum
sits in a tank where pulp is diluted with wash water. The vacuum
draws a pulp mat against the surface and wash water through the
mat. The drum rotation advances the washed pulp mat to the next
dilution tank. Wash water discharged from this wash stage is sent
to the previous washing stage. At least six Georgia mills use
vacuum drum washers. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pressure Washing</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Pressure washing is similar to vacuum drum, but differs by
spraying water under pressure through the pulp mat as the drum
rotates. At least one mill in Georgia uses pressure washing. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Diffusion Washing </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Diffusion washing is a counterflow process that takes place in
one or more stages. Pulp flow is upward and is carried on a
perforated plate; water flow is downward through a series of
baffles. This method offers a high degree of cleaning with low
water use. At least three mills use diffusion washers in Georgia. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chemi or Belt Washing</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>A Chemi or belt washer is perhaps the simplest washing system
design and offers reduced water usage with excellent cleaning.
Belt washing is a counter flow process where pulp enters the
washer area on a wire belt. Washing takes place under a series of
showers. Clean water enters on the opposite end from the pulp and
is sprayed vertically through the pulp. The used wash water is
then collected and reapplied to the dirtier pulp by the next
washing head countercurrent to the direction that the pulp moves.
This process is continued through at least seven stages until the
wash water is saturated with liquor after washing immediately
incoming pulp. The wash water is then sent to the recovery
process. Two mills in Georgia are known to use Chemi washers.
Reduced dilution of the liquor recovered from washing will result
in reduced energy usage in the recovery process. </p>
<p>The effluent from brownstock washing contains black liquor
that must be recovered in addition to varying amounts of water.
Diffusion washing and belt washing can reduce the amount of water
used per ton of pulp in brownstock washing by 50% or more
according to published data. However, the mills in Georgia do not
show order of magnitude reductions when using the newer washing
technologies. Comparison between mills is difficult due to
product mixes of virgin and recycled pulp; mills that have
replaced vacuum drum washing with diffusion or belt washing
report that improved cleanliness or water reductions were
achieved with the new technology, but exact figures were not
available. Improved cleanliness is important in reducing
bleaching load. </p>
<p><strong>Costs of Pulp Washing With a Chemi Washer</strong> </p>
<p>Although several mills in Georgia have upgraded pulp washing,
specific information on cost and water usage was not available.
In the EPA's document, Pollution Prevention Technologies for the
Bleached Kraft Segment of the U.S. Pulp and Paper Industry, the
following estimate was provided. </p>

        <td width="50%">Payback Period</td>
        <td width="20%">4.25 to 4.9 years</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>Due to the long payback period, replacement of vacuum drum
washers with a Chemi washer is more feasible in a new
installation or when a new washer is required to replace a vacuum
drum washer that has reached the end of its service life. The
installation cost does include all support facilities such as a
building to house the unit and piping. The actual replacement
cost would be less if support facilities were already existing.
Also, the operating cost reduction does not include savings in
the bleaching stage. Improved washing will result in less lignin
in the pulp thus reducing bleaching requirements. </p>
<p><strong>Bleach Mill Effluent Reduction</strong> </p>
<p>Washing of brownstock prior to bleaching allows the recovery
of wash effluent in the recovery boiler. Once the pulp has gone
through a chlorination stage, recovery is not practical due to
corrosiveness. Improved washing and increased delignification
prior to bleaching decreases bleaching load and reduces the load
placed on wastewater treatment. Bleach mill effluent reductions
can then best be achieved prior to any chlorination stage.
Improved delignification can allow bleached pulp mills to
eliminate certain bleaching and extraction stages while achieving
the same level of brightness. Elimination of a bleaching stage
can reduce water usage by 2,500 gallons per ton of pulp
production. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bleach Mill Effluent Recycling</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Several mills and corporate organizations are exploring reuse
or are reusing bleach mill effluent in previous bleaching stages.
Bleach mill effluent accounts for approximately 50% of a bleached
Kraft mill's water usage with effluent streams from each stage of
bleaching. Recycling water to previous stages could reduce water
usage by 60% depending upon the bleaching configuration.
Wastewater from bleaching and pulping will contain methanol,
other organics, and chlorinated compounds. Reuse in uncontrolled
areas could increase air emissions. Typically, a mill will
recycle white water from the paper machine back through the
various bleaching stages in a counter-current process. </p>
<p><strong>Other Water Use Reduction Opportunities</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Process Pump Seals</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Seal water used in various pumps has been eliminated by
replacing with mechanical face and lip seals in several
facilities around the state. Seal water flows are typically not
very high, but are continuous and can add up to large volumes
over time. Replacing water seals with mechanical seals usually
increases energy consumption due to friction. Seal water can also
be collected and reused for other processes but may contain
contaminants from the chemical passing through the pump. </p>
<p>Seals are also a source of air emissions, water pollution, and
raw material loss due to leakage of the material being pumped
through the seal. Chemical pump seals are being investigated by
some mills for replacement with sealless and magnetically coupled
pumps. An example of a sealless pump is a diastolic tube pump.
Magnetically coupled pumps transmit power from the motor to the
pump with a magnetic field. Traditionally, both designs are
better suited for low torque applications. In either case,
sealless pumps are not new technology and should work well in the
pulp industry. </p>
<p>Union Camp in Savannah has replaced water lubricated seals
with mechanical seals. According to an article published in the
November 1995 issue of &quot;Pulp and Paper,&quot; replacement of
braided packing seals with a self-lubricating compound has
reduced water usage and equipment failure. The compound used is a
&quot;colloidal mixture of lubricants amalgamated with Aragraphe
fibers&quot; manufactured by Tom-Pac of Montreal, Canada. The
sealing compound also allows leaks to be repaired by injecting
more compound into the seal. Replacement of water lubricated
seals also reduces the potential of bearing and gearbox
contamination with water, and seal water contamination with oil
or other materials. Union Camp points out that 95% of the seal
replacement projects have been successful. The benefits of this
waterless sealing compound to Union Camp have been: </p>
<ul>
    <li>reduced water usage</li>
    <li>reduced equipment damage</li>
    <li>reduced water contamination</li>
    <li>reduced maintenance time</li>
</ul>
<p>Vacuum pumps are used to supply vacuum to vacuum drum pulp
washers and other mill equipment. Vacuum pumps are typically
liquid ring pumps which use water for sealing and cooling. Water
usage is continuous and can be high depending upon the size of
the pump. Liquid ring vacuum pumps represent the common
technology used in hospitals and other facilities needing large
vacuum volumes. In resent years, oil-free and oil-flooded rotary
screw pumps have been used in some cases to replace liquid ring
pumps to reduce water usage in hospitals. This technology may be
useful in the paper industry to replace liquid ring vacuum pumps.
Water discharged from liquid ring pumps should be suitable for
reuse in any number of mill applications, but may contain some
process contaminants. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>White Water Recycling</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Paper machines can generate significant amounts of wastewater.
One mill generated 3,000 gallons per ton of paper. White water is
typically clean, but may contain some contaminants such as fiber,
lignin compounds, and various organics. Some of Georgia's pulp
mills are recycling paper machine water back to bleaching or
pulping operations. Where bleaching does not exist, white water
from the paper machine can be reused or partially reused directly
in pulp washing or in the wet end of the paper machine. One
Georgia mill recycling corrugated material reuses all white water
after clarification. The sludge that settles during clarification
is also reintroduced into the process. The company, Sweetwater
Paper discharges approximately 810 gallons per ton of pulp
produced. </p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
    <tr>
        <td width="100%">
        <p align="center"><strong>Case Study -- Recycling of
        White Water at Sweetwater Paper</strong> </p>
        <p align="left">Sweetwater Paper produces wallboard
        backing made from recycled paper. The paper is not
        deinked. Waste paper is repulped; new backing board is
        then made on a paper machine. Water removed from the
        board during sheet forming and drying is sent to a
        wastewater treatment plant where it undergoes
        clarification and pH adjustment. The majority of the
        water is then recycled with a small discharge of 180
        gallons per minute. Sweetwater manufactures approximately
        320 tons per day of wallboard backing. </p>
        <p align="left">Calcium sulphate is the most problematic
        component in the recycled water stream. Calcium sulphate
        is brought into the plant as a component of the waste
        paper. If the concentration becomes too great, calcium
        sulphate crystals can form within the plumbing system
        resulting in blockage. Sweetwater maintains solubility by
        adjusting pH and limited water discharge to prevent
        crystallization. Sweetwater discharges 810 gallons per
        ton of product, which is two to four times lower than is
        expected for this type of mill. In addition to recycling
        water, clarifier sludge is added back to the process. The
        only solid waste generated is from foreign materials such
        as plastic strapping present in the incoming waste paper. </p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="Chlorine  "><strong>Alternatives to Chlorine
Bleaching</strong> </a></h3>
<p><strong>Waste Generation </strong></p>
<p>Wastes of greatest concern from bleaching are chloroform and
dioxins. Elemental chlorine and sodium hypochlorite are the two
bleaching chemicals most associated with chloroform and dioxin
formation. For this reason, most mills have eliminated sodium
hypochlorite and replaced chlorine to some degree. Of the six
virgin bleached Kraft pulp mills in Georgia, three have replaced
elemental chlorine with chlorine dioxide. The other three have
substituted varying amounts of chlorine dioxide. </p>
<p>Bleaching, as previously discussed, is a multistage process.
Historically, bleaching was considered a separate process from
digestion and began with a chlorine stage. Currently, with
elemental chlorine use in decline, it is more difficult to define
where digestion or delignification ends and bleaching begins.
Some of the pollution prevention options discussed below perhaps
are closer to delignification than bleaching in historical terms.
In either case, the basic purpose of bleaching is to further
selectively delignify pulp. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chlorine Dioxide Substitution</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Georgia pulp mills have proven that 100% chlorine dioxide
replacement for elemental chlorine is technically and
economically feasible. Mills nationally have reported pulp
quality improvements by switching to chlorine dioxide. Some mills
using less than 100% chlorine dioxide report that increases in
substitution rate are not economically feasible. The lack of
economic feasibility seems to be related to equipment costs as
opposed to chlorine dioxide cost. Replacement or upgrade of
washers, bleach tower materials, and chlorine dioxide generators
were all mentioned as needed prior to increasing substitution
rates at these mills. Full substitution can also cause reduced
pulp yield and reduced brightness according to some published
data. </p>
<p>Chlorine dioxide costs more than elemental chlorine. Even with
chlorine dioxides greater reactivity, chlorine dioxide can cost
more than eight times as much as elemental chlorine according to
EPA documents. It is estimated by the EPA that the total cost of
generating one pound of chlorine dioxide is approximately $0.50.
The cost of an equivalent amount of chlorine is $0.06. In a 1,000
ton per day mill operating at 11% substitution, an increase to
50% substitution would cost $5 million initially with an increase
in operating costs of $1.9 million annually or $5.40 per ton.
Increasing to 100% substitution would cost $15.9 million
initially with an increase in operating cost of $7.1 million
annually or $20.30 per ton. Considering that pulp prices can
approach $1,000 per ton, 100% substitution represents an increase
in operating cost of about 2%. These estimates are based on
general averages and not one particular mill. </p>
<p>Reducing dependence on chlorine bleach can best be achieved
prior to bleaching. Bleaching is basically an extended chemical
delignification process. Chlorine is used to selectively
delignify pulp without causing the damage to cellulose that
traditional pulp digestion causes. The key to reducing chlorine
use is to find methods which delignify further prior to the
bleaching stage. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Chip Uniformity</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Uniform, thin chips achieve a greater degree of
delignification in standard or modified cooking processes by
allowing the chip charge to reach a predictable amount of
digestion using a specific chemical and thermal mix. Various
methods are available and include improved screening and
rechipping of oversized chips. This is a lower cost option for
improved delignification with or without bleaching. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Extended Delignification </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A number of methods exist for improving delignification
without extensive cellulose degradation. At least four mills in
Georgia use extended delignification techniques. These techniques
are primarily applicable to continuous digesters. New digesters
can cost upwards of $15 million. Some Kamyr digesters, which are
the most common type, can be refitted at costs reported in the $1
million range. Batch digesters can also be refitted in some
cases. Reduced operating cost by refitting results in payback
periods of approximately 18 months according to EPA documents.
The cost savings are reported to be in steam and reduction in
bleach chemical usage. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Oxygen Delignification </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Oxygen delignification requires the addition of a reaction
tower between the brownstock washers and bleach plant. Oxygen and
sodium hydroxide is added to brownstock. Reduction of bleaching
chemistry by 50% can be achieved in the bleaching process if
preceded by oxygen delignification. Washing follows oxygen
delignification; effluent can be recovered or discharged. At
least two Georgia mills use oxygen delignification. Cost of
building a new oxygen delignification tower can be in the $10 to
$30 million range, but may be offset by reducing bleaching needs.
Operating costs have been estimated to decrease by up to $3.70
per ton for softwood and to increase by up to $6.65 per ton for
hardwood based on studies conducted in Sweden and published by
the EPA. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ozone Delignification and Bleaching</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Ozone delignification is not used by any Georgia mills; only
one full-scale mill operates within the U.S. Ozone
delignification is similar to oxygen delignification. The Union
Camp mill in Franklin, Virginia, began operation in 1992 with an
OZEoD extended delignification and bleaching process at 1,000
tons per day of bleached kraft production. The overall
installation cost was $113 million. Operating costs of the OZEoD
delignification and bleaching process are reported to be about
50% less when compared to the more conventional CEDED or DEDED
process. D represents chlorine dioxide, E represents extraction,
O represents oxygen, and Z represents ozone. There is one pilot
mill in Georgia capable of ozone delignification and bleaching.
The mill is operated by the University of Georgia for the use of
the school and industrial customers for research. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Alternative Chemicals Used in Bleaching</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Chlorine and chlorine dioxide are the only bleaching chemicals
used in Georgia by virgin Kraft pulp mills. Oxygen and peroxide
are used to augment sodium hydroxide extraction. Oxygen and
peroxide act to delignify in the extraction stage essentially
replacing chlorine in later stages. Sodium hydrosulfite is used
by one mill in a bleaching operation producing newsprint. No
Georgia mills use ozone in bleaching, although ozone bleaching is
used in a pilot mill in South Carolina and a full-scale mill in
Virginia. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Enzyme Bleaching</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Enzymes are used by wood eating insects and bacteria to break
lignin bonds or to delignify pulp. Xylanase is an enzyme family
related to the chemicals secreted by such bacteria; it appears to
be useful in pulp bleaching, extended delignification, and
deinking. Mills nationally have used this chemical in trial runs;
results indicate that up to 50% reductions in chlorine
requirements can be achieved without damage to the cellulose.
Application of xylanase appears to be simple. Following
brownstock washing, xylanase is applied to the pulp as it enters
the high density storage tank. Xylanase works in the high density
storage tank and requires between 30 and 180 minutes of reaction
time. A washing stage follows the xylanase treatment. No Georgia
mills report using xylanase, but it appears to be a low cost
method of achieving significant results. Other enzymes such as
mannanase are being investigated. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Catalyst Improved Delignification </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Anthraquinone </p>
<p>Anthraquinone is a pulping reaction catalyst which was found
to increase the speed of pulping, increase yield, and reduce
pulping chemical usage by up to 10%. Anthraquinone is one of the
few new technological discoveries in the Kraft pulping field. Due
to cost, anthraquinone has not been used extensively in the U.S.
except in testing. Approximately 100 mills worldwide use
anthraquinone. Although developed as a pulping pollution
prevention technology, it may have greater use and be more cost
effective if used as an aid to extended delignification. The cost
of anthraquinone is expected to drop in the near future due to
patent expiration. Renewed interest may develop as a result.
Anthraquinone has been estimated to increase pulping costs by
approximately $5.00 per ton, but with increased yields of 0.75%
and reduced recovery boiler loading. An increase yield of 0.75%
represents an increase in production of 7.5 tons per day in a
1,000 tons per day mill. </p>
<p>Polysulfide </p>
<p>Polysulfide is another catalyst mentioned in trade magazines
applicable in pulping. Yield increase of 1.5% are possible with
improvements in strength. It is possible to use both
anthraquinone and polysulfide together. TAPPI publications report
that yield increases of approximately 2.5% are possible. </p>

<h3><a name="Log"><strong>Log Yard Waste Reduction</strong></a> </h3>
<p><strong>Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<p>Log yard waste is for some mills the largest solid waste
stream. Mills with on-site landfills will often use some of this
material as landfill cover, but there is often more waste than
needed for this purpose. Log yard wastes are typically bark and
woodchips mixed with soil, oversized logs and undersized limbs,
metal-containing logs, and mold damaged chips. Energy usage in
the form of fuel for log handling trucks is another raw material
input. In addition to pulp mills, saw mills, plywood plants, and
similar facilities will have log or wood yards and use some of
the processes described below. </p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Log Yard Operations</strong> </p>
<p>The purpose of a log yard is to receive incoming logs and
chips, debark logs, chip logs, and store bark and chips. Logs,
chips, and bark are delivered by truck and rail. These materials
are stored in stacks or piles. Logs are handled either by
rail-mounted cranes or large wheeled log trucks. Logs and chips
are stored by using some inventory management program to reduce
weathering and spoiling. </p>
<p><strong>Specific Causes of Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bark and Chip Contamination</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Bark and wood chips that become mixed with soil cannot be used
for fuel or pulping. Both materials fall from the margins of
piles and become soiled. Additional bark falls from logs prior to
debarking as a result of handling. All log yards are outside
facilities. Some are partially or completely paved. Others are
completely unpaved. Soil that becomes mixed with chips and bark
comes from exposed soil in the log yard. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Over-sized Logs</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Oversized logs are logs that are too large to be debarked or
chipped by mill equipment. The material is delivered to mill log
yards by truck and rail. Delivery of oversized logs is caused by
a lack of incoming material inspection. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Metal-containing Logs</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Metal-containing logs have nails or wire imbedded in the logs.
The metal may not be visible, but is detected electronically on
the chipper or debarking decks. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Woody Debris and Soil</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Undersized limbs and other debris such as soil and sand are
delivered attached to logs or trapped between logs. Soil and sand
is also delivered with bark and wood chips that are manufactured
offsite. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Decay</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Various molds damage logs and chips. The length of time stored
as well as weather conditions contribute to mold growth. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Poor Log Yard Layout </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Fuel usage can be significant. In one logyard that was handled
entirely by log trucks, an estimate of the miles traveled
annually by log trucks totaled 17,000 miles. The distance driven
contributes to fuel usage and maintenance costs. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Log Yard Delivery Specifications</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Oversized and undersized log disposal in landfills can be
reduced to near zero. Publishing of log size standards and
rigidly enforcing delivery standards will prevent delivery of
oversized logs. Incoming inspection of logs can prevent delivery
and disposal. Oversized logs that are delivered can be cut to
smaller size so as to fit in existing equipment or sold to
specialty lumber companies and mills that can accept larger logs. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purchase of Additional Chipping Equipment</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Undersized logs can be debarked and chipped. Debarkers are
advertised in trade magazines that can handle small and irregular
shapes. Once debarked, undersized logs can be chipped. Several
mills have purchased mobile chippers to handle this material. </p>
<p>Metal-containing logs were traditionally landfilled. Some
mills cut the metal-containing area from logs. The
metal-containing portion is landfilled; the metal-free portion is
debarked and chipped. There are chippers that can chip
metal-containing logs without damage. Metal, which is most often
steel, is magnetically separated. This material can then be used
a boiler fuel or chips for particleboard manufacture. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Paving and Improving Log Yards </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Paving log yards seem to be the best practice for reducing
soil contamination. Bark and chips that do fall onto the ground
will be less likely to become contaminated. Paved areas also
allow bark and chips to be collected for use. Maintenance costs
will probably decline for log yard trucks, debarkers, and
chipping equipment by preventing soil contamination. Log flumes
will also have reduced soil loading. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chip and Bark Cleaning</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Wood chips and bark that has become contaminated with soil can
be cleaned in vibratory screening systems. Several mills are
considering screening systems. The bark and chips would be used
as fuel after screening. Soil and fines can be used as landfill
cover or other soil use. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Log Yard Layout </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Fuel and truck maintenance costs can be reduced by designing
log yards to reduced distance driven. Time and material flow
studies are commonly conducted in manufacturing plants to reduce
fork truck travel and travel time. The same techniques and
benefits could be realized in log yards. </p>

<h3><a name="Lime"><strong>Lime Mud Waste Reduction</strong></a><strong> </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<p>Lime mud waste is directly related to lack of lime kiln
capacity. Some mills dispose of up to 200 tons per day. Lime mud
disposed of must be replaced by purchasing calcium oxide.
Disposal and purchase increase operating cost and fill landfills.
There is some offsite reuse of lime mud, but the majority is
disposed in landfills or storage lagoons. </p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Lime Kilns</strong> </p>
<p>Lime kilns are typically long rotating tubes where combustion
gasses and calcium carbonate pass through changing calcium
carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. Heat loss is great
since insulation is difficult to apply to the rotating housing.
Downtime is one reported additional problem. For various reasons
such as mechanical failure, kilns are often offline. Since pulp
mills operate continuously, lime mud produced during kiln
downtime is often landfilled. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Install Second or Larger Lime Kiln</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some mills have increase kiln capacity by adding second kilns.
In some cases, Georgia mills have reclaimed tons of lime mud
stored in treatment lagoons after adding kiln capacity. Kilns are
high cost devices. The economics of installing a new kiln are not
known. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vertical Kilns</strong><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>Vertical lime kilns can offer reduced down-time, improved
energy efficiency, and larger kiln capacity in a smaller
footprint area. Vertical kilns have not traditionally been used
due to some manufacturing limitations. A NICE3 grant was awarded
to Altex Incorporated to develop a vertical lime kiln; the pilot
plant tests are targeted to Weyerhaeuser's Flint River Plant in
Oglethorpe, Georgia. More information is contained in Appendix
II. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Energy"><strong>Energy Conservation and Recovery</strong></a><strong> </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<p>Energy is heavily used by the pulp and paper industry. Most
mills generate steam and electricity by burning black liquor,
coal, wood, and natural gas. Coal combustion is responsible for
much of the sulphuric acid and sulphur dioxide emissions reported
on the TRI. Additional expense to pulp mills in treating exhaust
stack emissions is also incurred. Ash is also a significant solid
waste stream and disposal problem when burning coal or wood
waste. </p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Energy Generation in Georgia Mills </strong></p>
<p>Mills typically burn wood both as an energy source and
disposal method to reduce volume. Mills that cannot meet their
energy needs from wood waste and black liquor combustion purchase
additional fuel in the form of wood, coal, bark, fuel oil, and
natural gas. Some mills have chosen to only burn wood since it is
a low sulphur fuel source. Many mills generate excess electricity
to sell back to utility companies or participate in the
utilities' power grid load management program. This can be a good
source of revenue for some mills. The majority of energy is used
to generate steam to heat water, processes, or generate
electricity. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options </strong></p>
<p>Sulphur emissions and ash generation can be reduced by burning
less fuel. Less fuel will be burned if the energy demand of the
mill is reduced, and energy value of the fuel is maximized. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Water Usage Reduction</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Since water is generally heated prior to use in mill
operations, water usage reduction will reduce energy costs. If a
heated water flow at 180 F is reduced 100 gallons per minute, the
annual water reduction is 50,400,000 gallons. The energy
reduction assuming 65 F ambient is 46,368,000,000 BTU. Assuming
that water costs $2 per 1,000 gallons, water costs will reduce
$100,800. Energy costs will reduce $289,336 assuming an energy
cost of $6.24 per million BTU. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Thermal Energy Recovery</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Energy demand can be lowered in pulp and paper mills by
capturing and reusing waste heat. Energy lost through cooling
towers, exhaust stacks, wastewater, and product can all be
recovered for reuse. Heat recovery and utilization opportunities
vary at each mill depending upon the mill age and layout. One
mill in Georgia has identified several recovery opportunities. In
this one mill specific example, recovery of heat from wastewater
by installing liquid-to-liquid heat exchangers to heat incoming
process water was estimated to cost approximately $1 million for
installation with a payback of less than two years. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Efficiency</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Energy requirements can be lowered by using more efficient
equipment such as high efficiency electric motors or by
redesigning processes. For example, energy required for drying
can be reduced by decreasing water content of pulp before drying. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Recommendations for Reducing
Energy Usage</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Conduct Energy Audits</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>A complete energy assessment should be conducted at each
facility to identify opportunities. Oglethorpe Power and Georgia
Power, the primary suppliers of electricity in Georgia, both will
conduct very thorough audits complete with recommendations and
cost / benefit estimates. The Energy Analysis and Diagnostic
Center (EADC) of Georgia Tech's Economic Development Institute
also performs advanced energy audits. EADC can be contacted by
calling (404) 894-3844. Some of the common opportunities
identified through audits are: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Replacing cooling towers with heat exchanger loops to
        heat supply water. </li>
    <li>Recovery of steam condensate. </li>
    <li>Recovery of &quot;low grade&quot; heat from hoods, vents,
        and waste water. </li>
</ul>
<p>Specific recommendations will vary at each mill location. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Fuel Storage </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The energy value of wood chips can be increased by decreasing
moisture content. Moisture content will increase in chips stored
in piles outdoors. Placing a cover over chip and bark fuel piles
is one method of reducing moisture, increasing energy value, and
decreasing decay. Mills will sometimes store pulp chips in silos;
this would be a good storage method for fuel as well. Turning
chip piles is another method of decreasing decay and moisture
content. Energy values can increase 10% or more by decreasing
moisture content, with a resulting 10% reduction of ash, fuel
demand, and some air emissions. </p>

<h3><a name="Needs">Pollution Prevention Assistance Needs of the
Georgia Pulp and Paper Manufacturing Sector</a> </h3>
<p><strong>Organizational Needs</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Education on the value of pollution prevention
        programs that provide for audits, waste cost accounting,
        and implementation of projects.</strong><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>This information may allow mills to upgrade existing outdated
technologies by proving or disproving cost effectiveness for
specific projects. Opportunities that are not obvious to mill
personnel can be identified by conducting audits. </p>
<p><strong>Technical Needs </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Information on leading industry and standard pulp
        and paper technologies. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mills are generally aware of the major technologies used by
the pulp industry. Specific information on the benefits of
specific technologies is still needed. Several mills indicated
that leading technologies such as belt washers and pressure
washers had been installed, but provided less than expected
performance. Technologies used by other industries for
maintenance cleaning and coating, or water filtration may be of
use to pulp and paper mills in replacing processes. Several
requests for this type of information were made by mill staff
during research for this paper. </p>
<p><strong>Technology Research Needs</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Research</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Basic research needs of the pulp and paper industry are being
met by various trade and educational institutions. Research
currently focuses on enzyme and catalytic augmentation of current
processes. Additional research involving zero-effluent mill
design is ongoing. Some industry experts predict that the next
century will bring totally biologic and enzymic pulping and
bleaching which will reduce energy and chemical use. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Applied Research</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Of greater interest to pulp and paper mills is bringing
current laboratory technology to the pulp mill. Enzymes,
catalysts, alternative bleaching, water reuse technology, and
advances in lime calcining are areas of applied research
interest. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Approaches">Approaches to Meeting Assistance Needs
of Georgia Pulp and Paper Manufacturers</a> </h3>
<p>The following section discusses how P<sup>2</sup>AD will meet
the pollution prevention needs of Georgia mills. </p>
<p><strong>Meeting Organizational Needs</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Provide Pollution Prevention Training </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Organization needs are primarily education and training of
mill management and production staff on the pollution prevention
techniques. The ultimate goal is to have each mill conduct
pollution prevention assessment, evaluate results, and implement
cost-effective solutions. Several Georgia mills and corporate
organizations do have working pollution prevention plans in
place. </p>
<p>Two roles that Georgia P<sup>2</sup>AD (in conjunction with
Georgia Tech, UGA, IPST, Herty Foundation, etc.) can play in pulp
and paper mill pollution prevention planning are to improve
awareness among mill personnel and to facilitate communication
between different pulp mills. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Facilitate Exchange of Information Between
        Manufacturers</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Facilitation can occur by identifying successful pollution
prevention programs in pulp mills and educating other mills of
success and opportunities identified. Publicizing successes
through published information and providing public forums for
information exchange are the methods that P<sup>2</sup>AD and its
partners can use. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Provide Experienced-based Training to Georgia
        Mills</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Teaching and training mill personnel by offering industry wide
and mill specific workshops are the suggested approaches for
providing general pollution prevention training. Specific
training on pollution prevention techniques applicable to a
particular mill process is also needed. In order to meet these
needs, P<sup>2</sup>AD and its partners must develop greater
expertise in pulp and paper mill processes. P<sup>2</sup>AD will
gain the needed expertise by participating in training offers
extended by some of Georgia's paper mills. Additional expertise
will be gained by conducting assessments with mill personnel at
Georgia facilities. Contacts made during the research for this
paper will likely lead to assessment opportunities. Training can
take place by attending courses and seminars offered by TAPPI and
other pulp and paper organizations. </p>
<p><strong>Meeting Technical Needs</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Publish Fact Sheets and Case Studies on New and
        Standard Technologies</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Technical needs are primarily information on new technologies
as well as information on industry standard technologies for
reducing waste and cost. Fact sheets providing general
information on new technologies can be developed and can include
enzyme, catalytic, and ozone processes. Case studies of
implementation of mill standard technologies can be developed
also and can include continuous digestion, belt washing,
diffusion washing, extended delignification, oxygen
delignification, and other mill processes. This information can
also be presented in public forums at technology conferences.
Cost reduction is perhaps the key issue when presenting case
studies. </p>
<p><strong>Meeting Research Needs </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Existing Research Resources </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD can aid in meeting applied research needs by
encouraging the use of existing state resources such as IPST,
Herty Foundation, and the research pulp mill at the University of
Georgia. The NICE3 project with Weyerhaeuser and Altex is one
such applied research project. Results of this project and other
paper industry related projects will be provided to Georgia mills
through fact sheets and workshops. P<sup>2</sup>AD will
investigate state and national resources for pilot studies in
pulping, bleaching, and paper making. This information can be
distributed through fact sheets and workshops. </p>
<p>Any new or existing basic research needs can be identified
though mill and corporate contact. P<sup>2</sup>AD will attempt
to find existing research programs addressing a particular need.
If research is not ongoing, contacts can be made at various
educational and industry organizations to determine a course of
action. This may include finding researchers with appropriate
expertise, additional industries interesting in funding research,
and other financial assistance sources. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Conclusion">Summary and Conclusion </a></h3>
<p>The purpose of this study is to identify the pollution
prevention needs of the Georgia pulp and paper industry. This
information will be used to develop programs within P<sup>2</sup>AD
or through partners to address industry needs. Some of the needs
and methods of meeting needs are listed below. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Significant opportunity does exist within Georgia pulp
        and paper manufacturers to reduce waste. Waste reduction
        has been accomplished at several mills by implementing
        pollution prevention programs to identify opportunities
        and implement cost-effective solutions. P<sup>2</sup>AD
        can provide the greatest assistance by facilitating the
        development of programs in all mills. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Georgia mills need information to replace existing
        processes with more efficient technology. P<sup>2</sup>AD
        can assist by developing case studies for various mill
        standard and cutting edge technologies. Mills can also
        benefit by learning of technologies used by other
        manufacturing sectors to reduce waste from maintenance
        and other non-process related operations. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Applied research is needed to industrialized new
        technologies. P<sup>2</sup>AD can educate mills on
        various applied research projects and resources in
        Georgia and nationally. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>New basic research needs probably exist concerning such
        issues as enzyme use. These issues will be identified
        through discussions with mill, corporate, trade, and
        research organizations. P<sup>2</sup>AD can assist in
        matching research needs with the appropriate technical
        and financial resources. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD will continue to seek educational
        resources for P<sup>2</sup>AD and partner organization
        staff with the goal of becoming well informed on pulp and
        paper mill industrial practices. P<sup>2</sup>AD cannot
        provide adequate assistance to Georgia mills without
        achieving a high level of expertise in pulp and paper
        technologies. </li>

<h3 align="center"><a name="APPENDIX I">APPENDIX I</a> </h3>
<p align="center"><strong>AN APPROACH TO SOLID WASTE MINIMIZATION
IN THE PAPER INDUSTRY </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Manfred K. Buder, Solid Waste
Minimization Project Manager Weyerhaeuser Company - Tacoma,
Washington</strong> </p>
<p>Since the late 1980s the paper industry has written numerous
success stories in the reduction of the solid waste it generates
and disposes. According to a survey by NCASI (National Council
for Air and Stream Improvement), in 1989, the industry generated
over 13 million tons of process wastes, nearly all of which were
land filled. Most of this waste consists of effluent treatment
solids (&quot;sludge&quot;), boiler ash, lime wastes, and wood
debris. In recent years the industry has made inroads in shifting
much of these residuals to useful alternative practices, such as
energy recovery and land application. </p>
<p>Weyerhaeuser Company ascribes to an integrated approach for
managing the solid wastes from its manufacturing facilities. This
means the coordination of a &quot;full tool kit&quot; of waste
management options and their implementation across all of
Weyerhaeuser's facilities. A key part of this strategy is to make
progress in reducing the generation of and finding beneficial
uses for these solid residual streams. There are five key drivers
for the company's waste minimization effort: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Environmental protection and tightening regulations </li>
    <li>Stakeholder expectations </li>
    <li>Company policy to conserve resources and minimize waste </li>
    <li>Landfill depletion and high replacement costs </li>
    <li>Economic benefits: avoided disposal cost and material
        recovery credits. </li>
</ul>
<p>Accordingly, Weyerhaeuser's mills in Georgia have made and are
continuing endeavors to minimize their solid waste streams. The
Flint River pulp mill recycles scrap metal, office paper, and
aluminum cans. The mill has also made significant strides to
reduce fiber loss, thereby not only conserving raw materials, but
also decreasing the quantity of primary effluent treatment sludge
that needs to be dewatered and hauled to the landfill. Our
composite panels mill at Adel provides another example of solid
waste minimization. Instead of land filling its sanderdust waste,
the mill sells it to a Florida utility company that uses it for
fuel. Per unit of product, our sawmill at Barnesville landfills
less of its manufacturing wastes that any other Weyerhaeuser
sawmill. This is largely because of the mill's resolve to recycle
these residuals as raw materials for particleboard manufacture
(at Adel), for use by horticultural and landscaping companies, as
a fuel (both internally and at Flint River), and for other
beneficial uses. The Barnesville sawmill has also undertaken
pollution prevention measures to reduce its generation of log
yard waste to a level that is unmatched by similar mills within
the company. </p>
<p>In support of this companywide effort, a technical team from
the Corporate R&amp;D group has been charged with providing
assistance to Weyerhaeuser's pulp, paper, paperboard, and wood
products mills to minimize solid waste generation and disposal.
This Solid Waste Minimization (SWMin) Team works with the mills
and with sister entities at the corporate offices to obtain data,
evaluate solid waste reduction opportunities at mills, develop
mill SWMin plans, and stay abreast of pertinent technologies. At
the heart of the program for the past several years have been the
SWMin studies conducted at Weyerhaeuser manufacturing facilities.
The SWMin Team with the help of mill staff, obtains data on
recurring, non-hazardous solid waste streams, and assists the
mills in identifying and capturing significant waste reduction
and utilization opportunities. Since the onset of the decade,
SWMin studies have been completed for nearly all of the company's
thirteen pulp, paper, and paperboard manufacturing sites. In the
last couple of years Weyerhaeuser's SWMin Team has been busy
working with various wood products facilities. </p>
<p>SWMin is a seven-step process. The first step is the planning
and coordination of the study with the mill. Second, the SWMin
Team, typically two engineers and two technicians, conduct a
week-long onsite survey to identify waste steams and their
sources/destinations, glean facts and data, take samples, and
obtain ideas and other input from mill staff. In the third step,
the solid waste streams are screened down to a manageable number
of key streams for which various short- and long-term
minimization alternatives are identified. Three screening
criteria are used: annual disposal cost, annual recovered value
of the stream, and associated environmental issues. Also, at this
point in the process the SWMin Team surveys potential uses and
users for selected residual streams as a reality check against
some of the utilization alternatives being considered. In Step 4,
the most promising combinations of waste streams and minimization
alternatives are further developed and evaluated based on roughly
estimated life-cycle economics. The &quot;top&quot; economic
opportunities are ranked by their net present values and reported
to the mill. These opportunities are reviewed and revised, as
appropriate, with mill staff in the fifth step of the SWMin
process. The purpose of this step is to select a reduction
target, finalize the SWMin project roster, and develop a
five-year SWMin plan. Step 6 is the implementation of this plan
and Step 7 is the documentation of SWMin progress against the
plan. The SWMin Team is available to the mills for technical
support during the implementation and documentation phases. Of
course, since costs, markets, production, and other things do
change over time, it will be necessary to loop back and revisit
some earlier steps in the process from time to time. </p>
<p>Typically, 50 to 100 solid waste streams, some of them very
small on a relative scale, are identified at each company pulp
and paper mill. Most of these wastes end up being land filled,
usually onsite. Others are burned, typically in the power boiler,
or land applied. Secondary effluent treatment solids are
impounded in lagoons for the most part, since few company mills
use activated sludge treatment systems. Small, but growing,
quantities of the mills' solid residuals are recycled. </p>
<p>The largest solid waste categories being generated by the
mills are various woodwastes, boiler ash, effluent treatment
sludges (primary and secondary), recausticizing wastes (dregs,
grits, lime, etc.), and general mill trash. Minimization of these
types of streams is certainly challenging. As examples, the SWMin
team and Weyerhaeuser mills have evaluated, and in many cases
implemented, the following SWMin approaches: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Woodyard debris: (1) debris separation into hog fuel,
        rocks, and fines (soil supplement); and (2) woodyard
        paving.</li>
    <li>Boiler ash: (1) boiler upgrade to improve combustion
        efficiency, (2) flyash screening and char reinjection,
        and (3) ash utilization as a soil supplement or
        construction material. </li>
    <li>Primary sludge: (1) avoiding mixture of ash, line, and
        other separable streams flowing into the primary effluent
        treatment system, (2) spill and leak control, and (3)
        recovery of fiber for internal or external use, or for
        energy recovery as a fuel.</li>
    <li>Grits and dregs: (1) purchased lime quality control, and
        (2) washing and land application. </li>
</ul>
<p>Although there are similarities among mills, the SWMin Team
found the mills to be at different stages of waste management
along the hierarchy of alternatives (i.e., from disposal up
through recycling and source reduction). However, significant
opportunities exist for cost effective improvement at each
facility surveyed. One result of these studies has been to make
the mills more aware of the solid wastes they generate, must
manage, and can minimize through examination of the projected
economic benefit. The risk mitigation &quot;stick&quot; and
opportunity &quot;carrot&quot; are significant enough to
encourage the mills to place higher priority on tracking their
solid wastes and planning for their future reduction. It is
interesting to note that those Weyerhaeuser mills that have made
the greatest effort to improve and have realized the associated
benefits tend to be the strongest advocates for further SWMin
progress. </p>

<h3 align="center"><strong>An Analysis of Pollution Prevention
Opportunities and Impediments in the Wood Products Manufacturing
Sector in Georgia</strong> </h3>
<p><a name="Intro"><strong>Introduction</strong></a> </p>
<p>The purpose of this report is to identify the specific causes
of waste generation, and cost-effective solutions that will
reduce waste in the wood products industry in Georgia. The
benefits of reducing waste are reduced pollution and decreased
operating cost to the business. Releases of high-priority toxic
chemicals are the primary focus of this report, but other
significant solid and liquid wastes will be included. Barriers
exist that limit the implementation of pollution prevention
projects and technologies. Barriers, and strategies to overcome
them will also be discussed in this report. </p>
<p><a name="Methodology"><strong>Methodology</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Review of trade and environmental publications indicated that
the processes responsible for the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)
releases are wood finishing and use of glues to bond wood
together. Businesses that are likely to use these processes were
identified by using the Georgia Manufacturing Directory. Not all
wood products manufacturers were the focus of this study. Only
those manufacturers were included in this study that: </p>
<ul>
    <li>use common processes that could release toxic materials
        to the environment and/or </li>
    <li>employ a large workforce in Georgia and/or </li>
    <li>there were a large number of similar manufacturers in
        Georgia </li>
</ul>
<p>This approach was taken to identify problems and solutions
that are most significant in Georgia. Georgia wood products
manufacturers that met these requirements were surveyed to
identify specific processes, waste reduction activities, sources
of waste reduction information, and barriers to pollution
prevention encountered by these businesses. The survey, selection
of manufacturers to participate in the survey, and survey results
were prepared by Georgia State University, School of Urban
Studies. The response rate for the survey was 15.7% or 97 of the
619 total manufacturers. Some companies that responded to the
survey were visited to observe how processes were used and to
gather information about waste problems other than toxic or
hazardous waste. Plant visits were made to nine wood products
manufacturers. Quantitative information was gathered on the
various chemicals and raw materials used and disposed. The
results of this study are presented in this document. </p>
<p><a name="Summary"><strong>Summary</strong></a> </p>
<p>The following key issues were identified as a result of this
study through the survey, contacts with Georgia wood products
facility personnel, facility tours, interviews with industry
experts, and review of various trade and environmental
publications. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Lack of Facility Pollution Prevention Programs </li>
    <li>Lack of Engineering Resources </li>
    <li>Waste Generation from Spray Application of Coatings </li>
    <li>VOC Emissions from Solvent-based Coatings </li>
    <li>VOC Emissions from Solvent-based Contact Adhesives </li>
    <li>VOC Emissions from Solvent-based Construction Adhesives </li>
    <li>Solid Waste Generation </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>---VOC ---Volatile Organic Compound</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Georgia Pollution Prevention Assistance Division (P<sup>2</sup>AD)
will assist Georgia wood products manufacturers in addressing
these key issues by developing various programs. The approach
that P<sup>2</sup>AD will take is to identify existing resources
that address organizational, technical, and research needs.
Georgia wood products manufacturers can benefit from developing
facility pollution prevention programs. Few wood products
manufacturers have pollution prevention programs; those that have
programs demonstrate significant waste reduction. P<sup>2</sup>AD
can assist manufacturers by contacting them through vendors,
trade organizations, or business organizations to provide
information on up-to-date technologies and the benefits of
pollution prevention planning. Demonstration projects showing the
applicability of new technologies such as water-based coating in
the wood products industry can also be an effective information
transfer tool. </p>

<p>Wood products manufacturers all make different products using
similar processes. Industrial processes will be discussed later
in this report. Even though processes are similar, the
manufacturers are a very size diverse group ranging from 1 to 900
employees located in 90 counties throughout the state. There are
several geographic clusters of manufacturers. </p>
<p>Georgia wood products manufacturers employ approximately
20,000 workers in 619 facilities. More than half, 355 of these
companies employ less than 10 workers. Companies employing more
than 10 but less than 100 workers number 207. There are only 57
companies with more than 100 employees. The only exception is in
the plywood, particleboard, and prefabricated construction
industries; these companies tend to be larger often employing
more than 100 workers. </p>
<p><strong>Metropolitan Atlanta</strong> is home to 166
manufacturers employing 3,600 people. The majority build cabinets
or millwork representing about 60% of the companies. Another 15%
build displays and showrooms for the retail and convention
industry. The majority of businesses near Atlanta are small firms
with less than 25 employees. Only five companies have more than
100 employees. The large companies employ 1,600 and primarily
manufacture millwork and furniture. The largest wood products
manufacturer in metro Atlanta employs approximately 800 workers. </p>
<p><strong>Southeast Georgia</strong> wood products manufacturers
within the target SIC codes number 75, employing approximately
4,000 people. As in the Atlanta area, most of the companies are
small, but there are a number of larger manufacturers. Fourteen
large manufacturers with at least 100 employees have a total
workforce of 3,100. Seven of the large companies manufacture
mobile homes. Others produce furniture, cabinets, and plywood.
Companies with fewer than 100 employees in this region are
involved mostly in the manufacture of cabinets (50%). Other
products are millwork, veneer, paneling, modular construction,
and roof trusses. </p>
<p><strong>Southwest Georgia</strong> wood products manufacturers
employ approximately 4,300 workers in 81 manufacturing
facilities. There are 18 companies with more than 100 employees,
employing a total of 3,100 workers. Mobile homes and
preconstructed buildings are the primary business of eight large
manufacturers. Manufacture of plywood and particleboard is the
main concern of five of the largest companies. There are 63 wood
products manufacturers with fewer than 100 employees in southwest
Georgia. Smaller manufacturers are involved primarily with the
manufacture of cabinets, millwork, and furniture. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Processes">Wood Products Industrial Processes</a> </h3>
<p>The wood products industry in Georgia consists of
manufacturers that shape, form, finish, or construct with wood.
Examples are prefabricated house builders, furniture
manufacturers, cabinet makers, and plywood manufacturers. Table 2
lists the common processes that are responsible for generation of
the majority of toxic chemical waste. The percentages in the row
beside each process represent a general estimate of the number of
companies that use these processes by SIC code based on survey
results and only represent approximate usage by these industries.
The majority of those surveyed use more than one process.
Printing and paint stripping were the least common processes
used, reported by about 3%. The most common processes reported
are listed below. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Assembly by 80% </li>
    <li>Use of glues and adhesives by 77% </li>
    <li>Spray application by 47% </li>
    <li>Staining by 45% </li>
    <li>Laminating by 42% </li>
    <li>Painting or coating by 42% </li>

<p>Plant visits to wood products manufacturers indicated the
wastes reported in the TRI and LQG reports are common byproducts
of the wood products industry. The difference between the
companies that provide TRI and LQG reports and those that do not
is size. Smaller companies typically use the same processes and
the same chemicals, but fall below reporting limits. It is
improper to assume that waste generation is then actually ten
times more than reported on the TRI based on the number of
employees. However, it is reasonable to assume that releases of
TRI-listed chemicals are greater than reported due to the fact
that most of the companies fall below threshold amounts for
reporting yet still use similar processes and chemicals as the
larger manufacturers. </p>
<p><strong>Toxic Releases</strong> </p>
<p>The specific chemicals reported released by these industries
are shown in Figure 1 as reported in the 1993 TRI. Formaldehyde
and phenol releases are found mostly within SIC 2493 and 2435
which manufacture plywood and particle board. These materials are
components of the glues and resins used in manufacturing. The
majority of other chemicals are paint-related solvents released
by SIC codes 2511, 2521, and 2431. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>FIGURE 1 - 1993 TRI RELEASES BY THE
GEORGIA WOOD PRODUCTS MANUFACTURING SECTOR (Pounds)</strong></p>
<p align="center"><img src="wood1.gif" width="412" height="265"></p>
<p><strong>Non-Toxic Solvents</strong> </p>
<p>Non-toxic solvents such as mineral spirits are not reported on
the TRI, but are used in coating and gluing operations. They are
significant as volatile organic compounds (VOC) that are
photoreactive and contribute to ground level ozone pollution. The
toxic chemical releases shown in Table 3 are mostly VOCs and also
contribute to ground level ozone pollution. Exact amounts of VOC
releases are unknown from the wood products industry. From
sealing, staining, and coating operations, total VOC emissions
including TRI reportable chemicals ranged from 0.03 to 0.05
pounds per square foot of coated surface with at least 200,000
square feet coated per year. This figure is based on two
facilities where estimations were possible. This information is
summarized in Tables 4 and 5. Additional VOCs are released from
the wood itself in situations where wood is chipped or
significant wood dust is formed, and is in the range of 0.5
pounds per ton of wood. A large amount of wood has to be chipped
before emissions are significant. </p>

<p><strong>Hazardous Waste</strong> </p>
<p>Reported hazardous waste is primarily generated from cleaning
paint guns and related equipment. Rags and wipes used to apply
stain are also disposed of as hazardous waste and reported by
LQGs. Many smaller businesses also generate and dispose of these
wastes as hazardous, but fall below reporting quantities. Rags
from applying solvent-based stain are sometimes disposed of as
solid, nonhazardous waste by manufacturers. Hazardous waste
generation by nonreporting companies could not be estimated since
records were often not maintained. </p>
<p><strong>Particulate Emissions </strong></p>
<p>Dust or particulate emissions to the air from sanding or
sawing operations will become significant under Title V air
quality regulations. Some wood products manufacturers who are not
currently regulated will become Major Sources due to particulate
emissions. Many of these manufacturers are not well informed on
environmental regulations and do not have the in-house technical
skills to handle regulatory matters. </p>
<p><strong>Storm Water</strong> </p>
<p>Storm water may be affected by sawdust and sanding dust that
escapes as fugitive releases or from dust collection systems.
This material was obviously present on the ground around some
wood products manufacturers visited. Storm water contamination
with wood dust is not likely to cause long term problems such as
ground water contamination, but can prompt complaints from
neighbors, block storm drains, and foul standing water. </p>
<p><strong>Solid Waste</strong> </p>
<p>Sawdust, short offcuts, knots, and sanding dust create a very
costly disposal problem for large and small industries. Much of
this material is disposed of in landfills. The companies visited
with 50 to 150 employees generated between 80 and 180 cubic yards
of solid waste per week. Disposal costs ranged from $1,500 to
$5,500 per month. Depending upon the business, the nature of
solid waste changed. Furniture manufacturers, cabinet
manufacturers, and similar businesses tended to generate sawdust
and offcuts of varying sizes as the largest portion of solid
waste. Prefabricated housing manufacturers generate wood waste
also, but a greater percentage consists of packaging waste and
nonwood building materials such as gypsum, foam panels, and paper
products. </p>

<h3><a name="P2">Pollution Prevention in the Wood Products
Industry Barriers, Sources of Assistance, and Waste Reduction

prevention barriers, and sources of pollution prevention
assistance. Table 6 reports barriers to pollution prevention
identified by the survey. Table 7 lists the sources of assistance
and information provided to companies about waste reduction.

<ul>
    <li>Two-thirds identified barriers to waste reduction. </li>

        and insufficient capital were the most common barriers. </li>
    <li>The only specific regulatory barrier identified was
        related to hazardous waste management. </li>
</ul>
<p>Small and large companies may see an economic advantage by
allowing rags that are wet with solvent to air dry to avoid
having to dispose of them as hazardous waste. If the rags are
properly stored in air-tight containers to prevent air emissions,
the company must ship them off-site as hazardous waste at $100 to
more than $500 per drum. The solvent is then recovered or
properly disposed. By allowing them to dry, air emissions are
increased, but disposal cost is minimized. Companies that are
doing a good job in handling solvent-wet rags are thus penalized. </p>

<p>It is important to note that approximately two-thirds of the
responding companies reported having received no assistance in
reducing waste and two-thirds reported significant barriers to
pollution prevention. The most common sources of assistance were
sources that have easy access to manufacturers. Vendors and
corporate experts typically know their products well, but may be
unable to inform companies of other available technologies used
by other industries. External organizations can help a company
overcome barriers by identifying sources of waste and methods to
reduce waste and cost. Government programs, university programs,
and trade associations can provide this type of information at
little or no cost. Consultants can provide this information plus
more detailed design for a fee. Trade organizations exist for the
benefit of industry and offer a wide range of services from
information on laws that apply to their industry to new and
innovative technologies. Since many wood products manufacturers
are comfortable working with vendors, providing vendors with
pollution prevention information may be one way of assisting
these manufacturers. The benefit to the vendors would be enhanced
service to their wood products customers. </p>
<p>Companies that have received help from external sources
identified two major impediments to pollution prevention. Those
are lack of economic feasibility (53%) and limited in-house
expertise (46%). Those that had received help from vendors and
corporate resources only evenly identified all barriers
identified in Table 6 equally at approximately 20%. Manufacturers
that have received no assistance also reported the barriers
listed in Table 6 equally. This would tend to indicate that some
of the concerns of reducing product integrity, technology
limitations, and regulatory noncompliance can be reduced if
companies use external assistance sources. There may be other
explanations as well. The concern of limited in-house expertise
is demonstrated clearly in the majority of the companies visited
by the lack of engineering resources. </p>

<p><strong>Waste Reduction Methods</strong> </p>
<p>The methods used to reduce waste are listed in Table 8. Almost
all companies reported minimizing waste in some manner. Plant
visits did not identify any unique inventory control, energy
conservation, or external recycling methods. Energy conservation
primarily consisted of turning off equipment when not in use or
using natural lighting. Larger facilities with boilers did
recover steam condensate and cleaned boilers to improve energy
efficiency. The most common method was reported to be inventory
control. External recycling of waste primarily consisted of
recycling steel packing material, cardboard, and aluminum cans,
but not process wood waste which is often the largest waste
stream. Several companies did recycle wood on-site by burning for
energy recovery in wood-fired boilers. External recycling markets
do exist for wood waste. The most unique waste reduction activity
noted was substituting plywood for hardwood in a furniture
framing operation to reduce waste. This is discussed later in
this document under Solid Waste Reduction. </p>
<p>Visits also indicated that very few of these manufacturers
have formal waste reduction programs in their facilities. While
very interested in reducing cost and waste, few companies
evaluate waste reduction opportunities using organized methods.
Most companies can be characterized as having an informal
approach to pollution prevention. These companies react to
problems and vendor suggestions, but seldom actively assess waste
reduction opportunities in their facilities. In general, the only
companies having formal plans are hazardous waste LQGs that are
required by law in Georgia to have a hazardous waste reduction
plan. The companies visited that are LQGs report either reduction
or attempted reduction of hazardous waste. </p>

        Planning at Basset Furniture</strong></p>
        <p>Bassett Furniture in Dublin, Georgia, produces high
        quality bedroom furniture. The process consists of
        shaping and assembly of hardwood components. Sealant,
        stain, and a clearcoat are applied. Some surfaces are
        inadvertently scratched during handling and processing.
        Scratches are repaired by removing the scratched finish
        with acetone. The surface is then refinished. This
        process generates hazardous waste from stripping the
        finish. Bassett Furniture has implemented a formal
        hazardous waste reduction plan. Their goal is to reduce
        disposal and generation of hazardous waste. Teams of
        Bassett employees evaluate the causes of hazardous waste
        generation and look for ways to reduce. As a result of
        this process, methods were found to reduce scratching of
        the furniture, thus eliminating the need to strip and
        refinish furniture. Basset teams also found ways to reuse
        solvent from coating line flushing. Instead of being
        disposed of as a hazardous waste, the cleaning solvent is
        directly used to thin coatings of the same color to their
        required consistency. Hazardous waste, disposal cost,
        rework labor, and raw material purchases have all been
        reduced. To date, hazardous waste has been reduced by
        60%. Bassett Furniture attributes this success not to the
        technology used, but to implementing a formal waste
        reduction plan.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="Facility ">Lack of Facility Pollution Prevention
Programs</a> </h3>
<p>Very few Georgia wood products manufacturers have formal
pollution prevention programs. In general, only hazardous waste
large quantity generators have pollution prevention plans.
Without planning or having a means of evaluating waste
generation, basic problems go unrecognized. The facilities that
did evaluate waste generation and cost have reduced waste. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Engineering ">Lack of Engineering Resources</a> </h3>
<p>Very few Georgia wood products manufacturers have an
engineering staff to handle product, process, and environmental
issues. Larger manufacturers do have such resources or contract
with outside firms. The lack of engineering resources may be an
impediment in bringing new technologies to the production
process. Also, environmental compliance may be impaired without
engineering resources. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Spray">Waste Generation from Spray Application of
Coatings</a> </h3>
<p><strong>Industrial Users of Spray Application of Coatings</strong> </p>
<p>Spray application of coatings is used by manufacturers that
finish wood surfaces with paint, sealant, stain, and lacquer.
Based on survey results, spray coating methods are used by
manufacturers of finished furniture, cabinets, prefabricated
construction, and millwork. As many as 300 Georgia manufacturers
spray coat wood products, but not all do so as a primary process.
Furniture manufacturers may coat 100% of their production while a
company that builds manufactured housing spray applies coating
very infrequently. </p>
<p><strong>Waste Generation </strong></p>
<p>Wastes generated from a spray coating process are commonly
solvents released to the air during painting or as the coating
dries. Solvents are also used in cleaning painting equipment
which releases solvents to the air and generates hazardous waste.
Solvents released to the air from painting and cleanup include
xylene, toluene, MEK, methanol, MiBK, naphtha, mineral spirits,
and alcohols. </p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Spray Application Processes</strong> </p>
<p>Appearance is the reason that spray application of coatings is
used to finish wood products. All manufacturers visited achieved
very good appearance of their finished wood products while using
manual spray application methods of coating. Automation of
coating application is apparently rare in the wood products
industry. </p>
<p>Furniture and other wood surfaces are coated with sealants,
stains, clearcoats, or lacquers applied in a paint booth. Paint
booth operators typically use a spray gun to apply coating on a
production line where a number of identical finished wood
products are coated in sequence. The number of painting stations
varied in plants visited from 30 paint guns to one. Even though
appearance is universally very good, spray techniques used by the
paint booth operators are consistently very poor from a waste
reduction aspect. </p>
<p><strong>Equipment</strong> </p>
<p>The most common paint spray guns used are either conventional
high pressure (HP) or high volume, low pressure (HVLP) guns. HP
guns spray a number of different coatings very well, but are not
as efficient as HVLP guns. Transfer efficiency (TE) is a term
used in painting to describe coating efficiency. A TE of 40%
means that 40% of the paint sprayed sticks to the workpiece
surface and 60% is lost as overspray. </p>
<p>Characteristics of Conventional High Pressure Systems: </p>
<ul>
    <li>TE is up to 40% if used properly. </li>
    <li>Cost ranges from $50 to $300 per gun. </li>
    <li>Spray applies a wide range of materials well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Characteristics of High Volume-Low Pressure Systems: </p>
<ul>
    <li>TE is 65% if used properly. </li>
    <li>Cost ranges from $200 to $700. </li>
    <li>HVLP guns require more consistent coatings. </li>
    <li>Very thick coatings may not atomize properly. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Train Operators to Use Correct Spray Techniques</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Spray techniques are the most important aspect of minimizing
waste from spray coating. High efficiency equipment will provide
low TE if poor application techniques are used. Some companies
reported that switching from HP to HVLP guns provided no
reduction in coating usage. When the process was observed, poor
techniques were consistently used by spray operators. Poor
techniques can reduce the TE to less than 20% regardless of the
type of gun and increase operating cost by 50% or more. Proper
spray techniques include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Triggering the spray gun only when pointed at the
        workpiece </li>
    <li>Maintaining the gun nozzle at the correct distance from
        the workpiece </li>
    <li>Moving the gun parallel to the surface at a consistent
        speed with a 50% pattern overlap </li>
    <li>Using the proper spray pattern for the width of the
        workpiece </li>
    <li>Using the manufacturers recommended system settings for
        pressure and coating consistency </li>
</ul>

        <p>Ethan Allen has a training program for spray operators

        The training consists of three stages:</p>
        <p>1 - Operators are video taped while performing their
        job (it is important to communicate the purpose of the
        taping to the operators before video taping starts so
        that there are no misunderstandings).</p>
        <p>2 - The operators in groups of three along with their
        supervisors and technical personnel, review the tapes in
        one hour sessions in order to identify ways to improve.
        Instruction on spray techniques is provided during the
        session and follow-up is provided during production on
        the manufacturing floor.</p>
        <p>3 - The operators are taped again and given a chance
        to compare the tapes and observe the improvements.</p>
        <p>The training is conducted twice a year and equipment
        and coating suppliers provide technical assistance. The
        company projects saving $50,000 to $70,000 annually as a
        result of 8 - 10% savings in material usage. Wastes and
        VOC emissions are also reduced.</p>

    <li><strong>For Non-critical Coatings, Use Other Methods
        Besides Spray Application</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Non-critical surfaces, areas where surface protection is more
important than appearance can be roller or brush coated. TE for
direct application methods can approach 100%. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Wiping Stains Can be Applied With a Sponge,
        Brush, Rag, or Roller Instead of Sprayed</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Traditionally, stains were applied directly. Stains are
designed to soak into wood and usually require a top coat such as
varnish to improve appearance and durability. Spraying may offer
no appearance advantage in operations where wiping follows
spraying. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Consider Alternative Spray Methods </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Airless guns can provide high transfer efficiency when
applying thick materials. Some companies can reduce thinning of
coating as well by using airless spray guns. High TE (40% to 65%)
can reduce the volume of coating used. The results are lower
operating cost, reduced energy cost since compressed air is not
required, reduced environmental release of solvents, and reduced
worker exposure. Spray methods are also available that use
liquefied carbon dioxide to replace solvents. </p>
<p>Airless spray systems often using heated coating are sometimes
used by wood finishers. These systems offer high transfer
efficiency and high quality appearance. Transfer efficiency is
estimated to be at least as high as HVLP systems. The following
case study compares two wood finishing shops each sealing,
staining, and applying clear topcoats to wood. One shop uses HVLP
guns and the other uses an airless heat assisted system. </p>

        <p align="center"><strong>Case Study -- Airless Spray
        Guns Applying Heated Coating in a Cabinet Shop</strong></p>
        <p>A cabinet manufacturer in the metro Atlanta area uses
        an airless spray system to apply lacquers and top coats.
        The system uses a high pressure pump to supply coating to
        the paint gun at up to 3,000 pounds per square inch. The
        coating is also heated to reduce viscosity. Coating
        atomization takes place through an orifice in the gun
        nozzle without the use of compressed air. The coated
        cabinet components are then air dried. The coating does
        not require excessive thinning or use of solvent to
        overcome quality problems. A total of 330 gallons lacquer
        thinner are used for equipment cleaning and some
        thinning. The average VOC content of all coating sprayed
        is 5.4 pounds per gallon including thinning and clean-up
        solvent.</p>
        <p>The total amount of coating spray applied is 1,150
        gallons coating 270,000 square feet, or each gallon coats
        235 square feet. In another wood finishing shop using
        HVLP spray guns applying similar coatings, 3,441 gallons
        are applied coating 350,000 square feet or each gallon
        coats only 102 square feet. Coating application using
        airless spray guns reduces coating usage by approximately
        56% or 1,497 gallons annually. Assuming an average cost
        of $10 per gallon for the coatings, estimated savings are
        $14,970. VOC usage for the shop using HVLP guns was 0.05
        pounds per square feet of coated surface compared to 0.03
        pounds per square feet for the shop using airless guns, a
        decrease of 40%. HVLP guns do have good transfer
        efficiency; some of the difference between these two
        finishing shops is probably due to the expertise of
        painters applying the coatings.</p>

<h3><a name="Coatings">VOC Emissions from Solvent-based Coatings</a> </h3>
<p><strong>Industrial Users of Solvent-based Coatings for Wood
Finishing </strong></p>
<p>Manufacturers of finished furniture, cabinets, and millwork
are the primary users of solvent-based coatings. From a user
perspective, solvent in solvent-based coatings allows quick
drying time, and reduced viscosity for better atomization in a
paint spray gun. Both of these features allow for increased
productivity and easy, high-quality application not requiring
highly skilled painters. </p>
<p><strong>Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<p>Waste generated from using solvent-based coatings are commonly
solvents released to the air during painting or as the coating
dries. Solvents are also used in cleaning painting equipment
which releases solvents to the air and generates hazardous waste.
Solvents released to the air from painting and cleanup include
xylene, toluene, MEK, methanol, MiBK, naphtha, mineral spirits,
and alcohols. </p>
<p><strong>Common Characteristics </strong></p>
<p>Most manufacturers air-dry coated products; solvent-based
coatings are well suited for air drying since they are mostly
solvent by weight. Most coatings are less than 35% solids.
Solvent-based coatings include sealants, stains, and lacquer. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Opportunities</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Water-based or High-solids Coatings</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Two common methods to reduce solvent usage are to use
water-based or high-solids coatings. Characteristics of
high-solids and water-based coatings are listed below. </p>
<p>High-solids Coatings: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Greater than 35% solids. </li>
    <li>Reduce solvent emissions. </li>
    <li>Increased coverage per gallon. </li>
    <li>Have increased viscosity.</li>

<p>Using high-solids coatings is a cost-effective method to
reduce solvent usage, emissions, and worker exposure. Heating the

        <p align="center"><strong>Water-based Topcoat Replaces
        Solvent-based Topcoat</strong></p>
        <p>Geiger Brickel, a manufacturer of high-quality office
        furniture has switched from solvent-based top coats on
        vertical surfaces to water-based clear top coats.
        Vertical surfaces are coated using manual spray methods
        and conventional high pressure spray guns. The coated
        surfaces are then dried in forced air ovens. The result
        is a decrease in solvent emissions by 25 tons per year.
        Furniture tops are still coated with solvent-based top
        coat due to improved durability. The greatest challenge
        in switching to water-based lacquer was finding the
        correct formulation. Geiger worked closely with a vendor
        to develop a coating to meet strict quality requirements.
        This project was partially funded under a grant from P<sup>2</sup>AD.</p>
        <p>The clear top coat previously used on vertical
        surfaces was a two-part urethane coating with a VOC
        content of 5.9 pounds per gallon. The new water-based top
        coat is also a two-part urethane coating with an
        isocyanate catalyst. The cost of the water-based topcoat
        is approximately 50% more per gallon than the
        solvent-based top coat. Overall, significant cost
        reductions were realized considering the water-based
        coating has proven in application to provide two to three
        times more coverage than the solvent-coating. On a per
        gallon basis, the water-based coating contains 0.32
        pounds per gallon instead of 5.9. On the basis of
        coverage, the water-based top coat contains 0.5 pounds
        per 1,000 square feet compared to 30 pounds per 1,000
        square feet for the solvent-based coating. The benefits
        of converting to a water-based coating for Geiger Brickel
        are reduced VOC emissions by approximately 25 tons
        annually, and reduced cost of coating by approximately
        40%.</p>
        <p>Some aspects of this project increased operating
        costs. Additional forced drying capacity was required
        increasing energy costs. Steel paint containers and cups
        were replaced with more costly stainless steel. Total
        costs including research, testing, and rework were
        approximately $302,000. Rework due to early test failures
        was the largest portion totaling $200,000.</p>
        <p>From a performance perspective, the water-based
        coating is comparable to the solvent-based coating. The
        following chart lists some important parameters.</p>

<h3><a name="Adhesives ">VOC Emissions from Solvent-based Contact
Adhesives </a></h3>
<p><strong>Industrial Users of Contact Adhesives </strong></p>
<p>Contact adhesives are used by cabinet and furniture
manufacturers to bond melamine surfaces to particleboard
subsurfaces to provide durable kitchen countertops and work
surfaces. </p>
<p><strong>Waste Generation </strong></p>
<p>Solvent emissions to air are the most common waste stream.
Solvents can represent over 80% of the adhesive by weight, and
are commonly hexane, MEK, and toluene which are hazardous air
pollutants. Toluene is another common adhesive solvent. Depending
upon the application method, cleanup of equipment can generate
hazardous waste, but in small quantities. </p>
<p><strong>Common Characteristics of Contact Adhesive Laminating</strong> </p>
<p>The melamine surface is purchased in rectangular sheets to
match countertop widths. This material is also cut in thin strips
and bonded to the countertop edges. A complete coating of
adhesive is applied to both surfaces and allowed to partially
dry. The glued surfaces are then placed face to face and air
bubbles are rolled from beneath the laminate. The same contact
adhesive is used to provide bonding to both the wide surface
(representing 10 to 20 square feet) and the narrow edge
(representing only 20 square inches). Failure of either surface
can occur, but it occurs more commonly on the narrow edge since a
small air bubble or delamination represents a much greater
percentage of the bonded surface. </p>
<p>The contact adhesive in common use is pink or red in color,
and available as solvent-based or water-based. The solvent-based
adhesive is approximately 85% solvent containing MEK, toluene,
acetone, and hexane. Some of the water-based adhesives contained
the chlorinated solvents methylene chloride or
1,1,1-trichloroethylene, but overall contained less solvent.. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Apply Adhesive with a Roller or Brush to Reduce
        Adhesive Usage</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Two methods of applying adhesive, application with either a
disposable paint roller or high-pressure spray paint gun were
noted during plant visits to wood products manufacturers. Spray
application of adhesive can result in wasting 60% of the adhesive
due to bounce-back. The adhesive bounces off of the surface and
falls to the floor. A comparison is provided below. </p>
<p>Application with high-pressure spray gun: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Transfer efficiency is less than 35%. </li>
    <li>Heavy build-up of overspray on floor and booth.</li>
    <li>Even application to surface is simple. </li>
    <li>60% increase in adhesive cost due to overspray loss.</li>
    <li>Increased energy cost due to compressed air usage.</li>
    <li>Periodic gun cleaning is required. </li>
</ul>
<p>Application with a disposable paint roller:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Transfer efficiency is very high, resulting in decreased
        cost. </li>
    <li>No overspray, reduced facility cleaning.</li>
    <li>Decreased worker exposure to air emissions. </li>
    <li>No use of compressed air, decreased energy costs.</li>
    <li>Little clean-up is required. </li>
    <li>Roller cover is disposed after use each day. </li>
    <li>Used roller cover could be hazardous waste. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Switch to Water-based Adhesive</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Companies that have switched to or are investigating
water-based contact adhesive are doing so for environmental and
safety reasons. A major concern is performance. One company that
uses solvent-based adhesive reported that water-based adhesives
failed on narrow edge laminates during testing, but they were
testing other water-based adhesives for better performance.
Another company had totally switched to water-based adhesives and
reported no significant increase in failures. Drying time for
water-based adhesives is greater than solvent-based. Water-based
adhesives do contain a lesser amount of solvents, but still
contain solvents that are considered toxic or hazardous. </p>
<p>There are a large number of different formulations available
from many manufacturers. Selecting an adhesive that works in a
particular situation requires evaluation considering safety,
environmental, and functional aspects. If an adhesive meets
functional requirements such as strength and ease of application,
the adhesive can be compared on a waste reduction basis.
Adhesives can be evaluated as follows: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Total solvent or VOC content - goal is lowest. </li>
    <li>Total amount of toxic materials - goal is lowest. </li>
    <li>Flash point - goal is highest. </li>
    <li>Coverage per gallon - goal is highest.</li>
    <li>Cost per square foot of coverage - goal is lowest. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other technologies are available and can be evaluated on a
similar basis. Some companies report using hot-melt glue and
white polyvinyl acetate (PVA) thermal cure glues for melamine and
wood laminates instead of contact adhesive. </p>
<p><strong>Other Pollution Prevention Options</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li>It is not necessary to use the same adhesive on wide and
        narrow surfaces. A high-strength solvent-based adhesive
        may be required on a narrow edge, while a water-based
        adhesive may perform well on the wider surface. A 10
        square foot surface bonded with a low strength glue
        capable of withstanding a force of 2 pounds per square
        inch has a total resistance to force of 2,880 pounds. A
        high strength glue may not be needed. On a narrow edge
        with 10 square inches of area, the low-strength glue will
        provide a resistance of only 20 pounds; a higher strength
        glue is probably needed. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Evaluate other technologies such as hot-melt and PVA
        glues.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Evaluate mechanical fastening techniques such as nails,
        pins, screws, and specialty brackets. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Construction ">VOC Emissions from Solvent-based
Construction Adhesives</a> </h3>
<p><strong>Industrial Uses of Construction Adhesives</strong> </p>
<p>Construction adhesives are used to bond wood to other
construction materials such as drywall, foam panels, or metal.
Use of these adhesives are common in the mobile home,
prefabricated construction, and home building industries. </p>
<p><strong>Waste Generation </strong></p>
<p>In the mobile home industry, 90 to 100 pounds of construction
adhesive can be used to build a 1,500 square foot double-wide
construction. This material is usually supplied in 29 ounce tubes
used in caulk guns. Building a single mobile home can generate
over 50 empty tubes which would fill a 55 gallon drum. Tubes are
often disposed of as solid waste, but are probably hazardous if
they still contain adhesive. </p>
<p>There are a number of types of construction adhesives
available and often contain solvents such as acetone, hexane, and
toluene. These solvents are released to the air as the adhesive
dries; some are hazardous air pollutants. </p>
<p><strong>Common Characteristics</strong> </p>
<p>Construction adhesives are usually supplied in a tube and
applied with a caulk gun. The adhesives are very viscous to
prevent running. They are usually used in situations where
additional fastening methods are used. The adhesive is applied
and a nail or screw is used to force the two surfaces together.
They provide strength, flexibility, sealing, and bonding to a
wide variety of materials. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Switch to a Water-based Construction Adhesive</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Water-based and solvent-based adhesives are available from a
number of different manufacturers. PVA products are available
that contain little or no solvent at a comparable cost to the
more common solvent-based adhesives. Vendors report that these
materials work as well as the solvent-based adhesives, but are
not used by most customers. Construction adhesives only need to
be viscous and dry to a moderate strength since they are usually
used in conjunction with nails or screws. Water-based, latex, or
PVA construction adhesives should be as easy to use as
solvent-based, and provide the same performance. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purchase the Adhesive in Bulk</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Construction adhesives are available in different packages
such as cans, tubes, drums, and totes. Purchasing the material in
drums or totes will require the purchase of a pump or other
distribution equipment, but will eliminate disposal of empty,
potentially hazardous tubes if the containers are returned to the
vendor for refill. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Solid Waste ">Solid Waste Generation</a> </h3>
<p><strong>Processes Generating Solid Waste</strong> </p>
<p>All wood products manufacturers produce some wood waste.
Sanding wood will produce sander dust. Sawing, milling, and
turning will produce sawdust and chips. Trimming boards will
produce short offcuts. Knots and other flaws are often removed
producing additional offcuts. These materials are often disposed
of in landfills or burned for energy recovery. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sawdust, Sander Dust, and Machining Dust</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few basic methods of reducing type of waste.
Purchasing wood dimensionally close to the needed size will
reduce the number of cuts and the amount of material removed by
sanding or milling. Reduced material removal will reduce saw,
sander, and machining dust. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Offcuts </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Short and damaged boards are common wastes that are disposed.
Purchasing material with fewer flaws and of consistent width and
length will reduce waste. Reusing offcuts and damaged material to
manufacture other products can reduce waste sent to landfills.
Offcuts can also be recycled by sending waste material to other
manufacturers to be used as a fuel or raw material. Several
methods are listed below that are used by wood products
manufacturers to reduce waste. </p>
<p>Cuts are planned to obtain the most usable material from each
board. Offcuts are used to make nailer blocks, spacers, and
braces, sometimes replacing purchased steel products. Scrap solid
wood is joined with PVA glues in a heated press to form butcher
block surfaces. Short boards are end joined with finger joints to
form boards of usable length. Composites such as plywood or
particle board are substituted for solid wood products to reduce
scrap caused by knots, splitting, and other flaws. </p>

        <p>Gailey Manufacturing of Americus, Georgia,
        manufactures upholstered furniture with wood and metal
        frame construction. Hardwood was used to assemble the
        majority of the upholstered frames. Strength is critical
        in building high quality furniture; flaws such as cracks
        were removed from hardwood board before use. As much as
        40% of all hardwood was scrapped due to defects. Some of
        this scrapped material was still usable to construct
        butcher block surfaces after the defect was removed; the
        remaining wood was disposed of in the county landfill at
        the rate of 80 cubic yard per month costing $4,320
        annually. </p>
        <p>Plywood could achieve and exceed the strength
        requirements. Plywood costs significantly more than the
        hardwood used per board foot, and special cutting
        equipment requiring a large investment would be needed
        for cutting to the correct shape. Evaluating the process
        using tests indicated that the raw material scrap rate
        would be reduced to 2% from 40%, reducing waste volume
        and the amount of material purchased. Gailey made the
        switch to plywood. Overall operating cost of this process
        is now reduced by 50% with decreased wood waste. Disposal
        costs will reduce to approximately $180 annually. </p>

    <li><strong>Waste Wood Recyclers </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are alternatives to disposal in a landfill. Some wood
products manufacturers, saw mills, lumber yard, and drying kiln
operators burn wood as a fuel. Some saw mill operators will
return ship sawdust from their customers after delivering lumber.
Some pulp mills will accept wood waste. Particleboard and
paneling manufacturers can also use this material to manufacture
these products. </p>
<p>Kiln operations found at lumber yards, furniture
manufacturers, and saw mills need wood waste for fuel. Paneling
and particleboard manufacturers can use wood waste for fuel and
raw material. Boiler operations found at pulp, paper, and other
forest product mills often purchase wood waste for fuel. </p>
<p>The keys to finding and keeping a recycler include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Treat wood for recycling as a valuable product, not
        waste. </li>
    <li>Wood must be kept clean, dry, and unmixed with waste. </li>
    <li>Do not mix reconstituted woods (particleboard, plywood,
        strandboard, paneling) with solid wood. </li>
    <li>Do not mix pine with hardwood unless your recycler knows
        and can accept the material. </li>
    <li>Do not mix sawdust with large pieces of wood unless your

total number. The existence of a program was most common among
hazardous waste LQGs since a plan is required by Georgia
environmental regulations. Most of the manufacturers contacted
were interested in reducing waste and cost, but did not have an
active pollution prevention program. Some primary needs of wood
product manufacturers are to implement a pollution prevention
program and to be educated on the benefits of such a program. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Few Georgia wood products manufacturers have an
        engineering or technical staff. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of Georgia wood products manufacturers are small
businesses that are primarily focused on production of a
particular product. Companies with engineering resources are
primarily those with more than 100 employees, or build complex
designs such as prefabricated and trailer mounted housing. New
technologies that benefit the businesses from an engineering
perspective are discovered by the small businesses through
vendors. Trade shows where vendors show and demonstrate new
products were mentioned by several wood products manufacturers as
a primary resource for finding new technologies. Access to
engineering resources is a primary need of small wood products
manufacturers to better evaluate and identify beneficial
technologies. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Most Georgia wood products manufacturers are
        unaware of the various state, federal, and university
        technical assistance programs that can aid in waste
        reduction. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Fewer than 12% of the businesses that responded to the survey
had used either university or government programs to assist in
minimizing waste. Most companies contacted were unaware of the
existence of such programs. Most federal, state, and university
programs can provide information at no cost to the business. Wood
product manufacturers need to be informed of the existence of
technical assistance programs. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Few Georgia wood products manufacturers are
        active with trade associations. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of trade associations available to wood
products manufacturers. There are 73 wood product associations
listed in the National Trade and Professional Associations 1995
directory. Manufactured housing businesses are involved with the
Georgia Manufactured Housing Association. Large particleboard,
plywood, and veneer manufacturers tend to be members of various
trade organizations. In general, the small manufacturer is not a
member of any trade organization. There are only 4 companies in
Georgia that are member of the National Furniture Manufacturers
Association. The Hardwood Plywood and Veneer Association has
approximately 8 members in Georgia. Several companies contacted
indicated that they were active with the local Chamber of
Commerce. Wood products manufacturers could benefit from becoming
active members of trade organizations by taking advantage of the
technical, educational, and regulatory programs offered by the
associations. </p>
<p><strong>Technical Needs </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Waste reduction could be realized in solvent
        emissions by some relatively simple methods that would
        result in significant cost reduction. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There is an overall lack of awareness of new technologies in
the Georgia wood products industry. This is caused by several
factors such as a lack of engineering resources, little or no
activity within trade organizations, and the lack of either
formal or informal waste reduction programs. Some simple
solutions to these technology gaps are listed below. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Training of employees who spray apply coatings.</li>
    <li>Education on various spray application technologies such
        as HVLP, airless, electrostatic, etc. </li>
    <li>Education on alternative coatings - UV cure, high-solids,
        water-based.</li>
    <li>Education on alternative low-VOC glues and adhesives.</li>
    <li>Education on how to use existing waste recyclers.</li>
    <li>Education on environmental compliance including Title V.</li>
    <li>Education on automation of assembly and coating
        processes.</li>
    <li>Education on alternative engineering materials </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technology Research Needs </strong></p>
<p>The previous pages addressed common technologies that have
potential waste reduction opportunities encountered in the wood
products industry. The information presented provides a statement
of the type of technology used, the level of expertise at which
it is used, and ways to reduce waste. Not all processes and
technologies used by wood product manufacturers are discussed.
Some of the common processes are universally done well and have
very few health or environmental concerns. Research may be needed
to reduce emissions from urea and phenol resins, and to further
industrialize water-based coatings for wood products. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Alternatives to Urea and Phenol Formaldehyde
        Resins</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Urea formaldehyde resins are used to manufacture particleboard
and similar materials by bonding wood fibers together. Urea
formaldehyde resins will make up less than 5% of the weight of
the finished wood; the majority of the finished board consists of
wood. These resins do release formaldehyde from processing.
Phenol formaldehyde resins are used to manufacture strandboard
and plywood. The 1993 TRI reported releases from these industries
in Georgia of 167,078 pounds of formaldehyde and 154,780 pounds
of methanol. Methanol is also a component of urea formaldehyde
resins. Phenol emissions in Georgia from these industries were
20,396. Phenol formaldehyde resins seem to contain less methanol,
but are dark in color. The dark color of phenol formaldehyde is
unsuitable for most particle board due to appearance, but is used
internally in plywood manufacture. </p>
<p>There are some companies using various isocyanate resins as an
alternative to either urea or phenol formaldehyde. Isocyanate
resins are an alternative, but typically have a cost disadvantage
when compared to urea or phenol formaldehyde. Isocyanates are
also considered a worker exposure hazard and are reportable on
the TRI. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Alternatives to Solvent-based Coatings </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Water-based clearcoats do exist that can replace solvent-based
materials for high-quality furniture finishing. Current feedback
from industries using water-based clear-coats indicate that they
are slightly less durable. Companies that have switched to
water-based clear-coats have had to absorb large costs associated
with research and equipment investment. Additional research is
needed to further industrialize water-based and other low VOC
coatings that have the high durability of current solvent-based
materials. These materials may exist in other industries. Basic
research and or demonstration projects are needed to make low VOC
technologies available to the small wood products manufacturer.
Some of the water-based coatings in current use also contain
isocyanates. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Meeting">Meeting the Pollution Prevention Needs of
the Wood Products Manufacturing Sector</a> </h3>
<p><strong>Meeting Organizational Needs</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Provide Pollution Prevention Training</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Small and large wood products manufacturers will benefit from
education and training of plant management and production staff
on pollution prevention techniques. The ultimate goal is to have
each company conduct pollution prevention assessments, evaluate
results, and implement cost effective solutions. </p>
<p>Due to the large number of manufacturers, one-on-on training
with each company is not practical. Training could be partially
accomplished by conducting workshops in the Atlanta area, and one
or more workshops in each of the other Georgia regions.
Participation of the Chamber of Commerce and various trade
organizations in training activities would enhance the process.
Fact sheets will also be developed for wood products
manufacturers. P<sup>2</sup>AD will develop fact sheets and
design workshop programs as part of existing conferences or as
stand alone presentations. Education and training of vendors that
work with the wood products industry on pollution prevention and
assistance resources are other ways of reaching wood products
manufacturers with beneficial information. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Identify Engineering Resources for Process Design
        and Environmental Services </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Engineering resources are available for small businesses
through EDI's network of regional offices. Georgia Tech Research
Institute (GTRI) also provides engineering services though
regional offices. Services may include information on equipment
selection, manufacturing, and environmental compliance. In order
to take advantage of these services, P<sup>2</sup>AD will provide
descriptions of these and other services available to wood
products manufacturers. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Identify Educational Resources to Provide
        Environmental Regulatory Training </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Identify and Encourage Development of Wood
        Products Trade Organizations </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The above items will require additional research to identify
resources and design programs to meet these needs. </p>
<p><strong>Meeting Technical Needs </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide training on new and standard coating technologies
        and equipment </li>
    <li>Provide training resources for coating and adhesive
        application </li>
    <li>Provide education on alternative coatings and adhesives </li>
</ul>
<p>This information can be distributed in booklet form and
through workshops. P<sup>2</sup>AD will first develop written
information for distribution to wood products manufacturers.
There are several good documents previously published that can
serve as models or that can be distributed without further
editing. Any workshops developed for wood products manufacturers
will include this information. </p>
<p><strong>Meeting Research Needs </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Several trade organizations are active with particleboard
        and plywood manufacturers. These organizations may be
        interesting in supporting research in alternative resins
        and application systems. Applied research projects may be
        necessary to take advantage of previously completed
        research. P<sup>2</sup>AD should seek industrial partners
        in developing research programs. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Applied research or demonstration projects will be
        identified to help bring new coating technologies to wood
        products manufacturers. P<sup>2</sup>AD should seek
        industrial partners for completion of demonstration
        projects. Information gained will be distributed through
        fact sheets and workshops </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Conclusion">Summary and Conclusion </a></h3>
<p>The purpose of this study is to identify the pollution
prevention needs of the Georgia wood products industry. This
information will be used to develop programs within P<sup>2</sup>AD
to address industry needs. A summary of the needs and methods of
meeting needs are listed below. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Significant opportunity does exist within Georgia wood
        products manufacturers to reduce waste. Waste reduction
        has been accomplished at several wood products
        manufacturers by assessing waste generation and
        implementing solutions. P<sup>2</sup>AD can provide the
        greatest assistance by facilitating the development of
        programs in all mills through its technical outreach
        program. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Georgia wood products manufacturers need information to
        replace outdated processes with more efficient
        technologies. P<sup>2</sup>AD can assist by developing
        case studies and fact sheets describing more efficient
        technologies and equipment. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Applied research is needed to industrialized new
        technologies. To a lesser extent, basic research is
        needed. P<sup>2</sup>AD can educate wood products
        manufacturers on various research projects that have
        taken place nationally. Public -- Private partnerships
        should be formed to demonstrated new technologies that
        will reduce pollution. </li>

<h2 align="center">No-Clean Technology </h2>
<p align="center"><strong>By Paul Crumpler, Pollution Prevention
Engineer</strong> </p>
<hr>
<p>You will not find no-clean technology listed in the Yellow
Pages. This is because there is no specific cleaning product to
buy, and vendors sell products. No-clean methods generally
require procedural or design changes that eliminate the need to
clean products during production, and production equipment
between production runs. </p>
<p>An example of converting to a no-clean method is to eliminate
degreasing of a steel component manufactured in a lathe prior to
painting. The degreasing step could be deleted by replacing or
eliminating the use of cooling oil in the machining process. In
this example, the cooling oil could be eliminated by some
combination of a reduction of the machining rate, use of ceramic
or carbide tool inserts, cooling with water only followed by
drying, cooling with air or other compressed gas, or cooling with
a fluid that is compatible with the paint. </p>
<p>Another example is to eliminate cleaning in mixing vats
between production runs by using dedicated mixing vats for each
product or product family. This would require the purchase of
additional mixing vats, but the purchase may have a significant
payback when waste costs are factored into the economic
justification. Waste costs include lost raw material costs, lost
profit on sales of the product, treatment costs, and disposal
costs. </p>
<h3>Assessing The Necessary Level of Cleanliness </h3>
<p>Degreasing in a vapor degreaser followed by shot blasting will
usually provide a steel component with a very clean surface
appropriate for painting. This is an expensive method to assure
cleanliness. The component may have already been clean enough for
painting prior to degreasing or blasting. Vapor degreasing cleans
a dirty component just as well and for the same cost as a clean
component. Excessive cleaning usually cannot be found by
inspection or by function. The only evidence of over cleaning is
in increased waste generation and increased cost. Before
specifying a specific cleaning process, the level of allowable
contamination should be known for the component. </p>
<p>Experiments can be designed to determine the level of
cleanliness required; cleanliness inspection methods can also be
devised. In the above example of a steel component manufactured
on a lathe prior to painting, paint adhesion could be compared
between several parts that were degreased and several that were
not degreased. If adhesion levels do not vary between the two
groups, degreasing is not necessary and can be eliminated. If
adhesion does vary but only in specific locations on the
component, it is important to determine the cause. Contamination
such as cooling oil generally would cause paint to not adhere
consistently over the component. Fingerprints left by workers
during part handling commonly cause spotty paint adhesion.
Instead of degreasing, lathe or paint booth operators may need to
wear gloves. A cleaning and adhesion problem in one manufacturing
plant was found to be hand cream used by several machine
operators. Hand washing, not parts washing, solved the problem.
Components with varying levels of contamination can be painted to
determine the maximum contamination level and type of
contamination that causes paint adhesion or other quality
problems. This information should be communicated to machine
operators or vendors in the form of cleanliness specifications.
If the cleanliness specifications can be achieved without
cleaning, reduced waste and cost can be achieved. Another method
to achieve required paint adhesion without cleaning may be to
switch to a different type of paint. Paint vendors may be able to
supply paint that will provide the required performance without
or with reduced surface cleaning. </p>
<h3>Production Scheduling </h3>
<p>Production scheduling may reduce or eliminate the need to
clean processing equipment between production runs. Production
runs should usually be scheduled so that residues left in
processing equipment from the previous process do not interfere
with the subsequent process. Processes such as painting,
printing, or dyeing should be run with products that use the
exact same colors and chemistries over the course of a day or
shift to reduce cleaning to only the end of the shift. If color
or chemistry changes are needed, colors should be run so that
each production change will result in a darker color used. Run
colors from white to black. Also, run compatible chemistries
together. Avoid changes such as from water-based to oil-based
back to water-based. Rescheduling to run the two oil-based
chemistries back to back could eliminate one cleaning process. Be
aware of temperature changes; processes that run at the same
temperatures should be run consecutively to conserve energy. </p>
<p>Use of dedicated mixing vats was discussed previously as a
method to reduce waste and save money. Assume that a manufacturer
mixes a number of different cleaning agents. When designing the
mixing process, the number of mixing vats will need to be
determined. The manufacturer can determine the most efficient
production schedule and optimize the number of dedicated mixing
vats needed by comparing chemistries and determining which ones
are compatible. Using one mixing vat and cleaning between each
production run may be a waste of resources; using a dedicated
tank for each product may also be a waste of resources. Each of
the product chemistries should be analyzed and grouped for
chemical compatibility. This information can be used to determine
the most efficient production schedule that will minimize cleanup
wastes in the minimum number of dedicated vats. </p>
<h3>Component Design </h3>
<p>Production cleaning should be considered during product
design. Blind holes should be avoided. Holes that are drilled and
tapped into a component should be drilled completely through
where the design allows. Not only are through holes easier to
drill and tap, through holes are easier to clean. Blind holes are
traps for machining residues. Hand wiping and most other cleaning
methods are not effective in removing residues from blind holes.
Typically, blind holes will hold liquid and machining chips.
Machining chips left in internal oil passages will probably not
cause painting or other processing problems. However, residual
machining chips and cooling oil left in internal passages and
other blind holes are among the leading causes of machine failure
in new assemblies. </p>
<p>Alternative materials may be a solution to cleaning. Steel
components may need to be machined, degreased, and painted in
order to meet functional and appearance specifications. Replacing
steel with a colored plastic may eliminate cleaning and painting.
An example can be found on most office desktops. Traditionally,
staple gun exteriors were made of formed steel components that
were painted either beige or black. Today, most staple gun
exteriors are formed of injection molded plastic of the correct
color, thus eliminating the need to form, clean, or paint. </p>
<h3>Production Equipment Design </h3>
<p>Production equipment can also be designed to reduce the need
to clean. Guards should be placed around processes to catch drips
and splatters that would have to be cleaned from the floor.
Funnels and guides can be added to equipment to allow operators
to add dry or wet chemicals without spillage. Internal passages
can be designed so that production chemicals drain into the
process instead of becoming trapped inside the equipment.
Internal passages and external piping should be designed to be as
short as possible to reduce the amount of surface area that may
need to be cleaned between production runs. Drip trays, pans, and
drain boards can be designed as part of equipment to channel
spills back into the process. </p>
<p>Paint spray or glue application guns used to apply two-part
chemicals are often designed so that mixing of the resin and
hardener takes place only in the gun tip. Resin and hardener are
fed to the application gun tip in two tubes instead of being
mixed in a pressure tank or gun cup. This allows the gun tip to
be removed and cleaned at the end of the shift instead of
flushing the hoses and pressure tank. In addition to eliminating
the need to clean a large amount of equipment, this method
reduces the amount of glue or paint wasted to only that very
small volume in the gun tip. A very simple example of this
process is the two-part epoxy syringe packages available in
retail stores. </p>
<p>Non-stick surfaces, such as Teflon or polyethylene, can be
added to production equipment to aid in removal of residues.
Powder coating paint booths typically have very smooth plastic
interior surfaces to prevent the powder from adhering. When
cleanup is required, it can usually be achieved with vacuuming.
Scraper and automated knives in the plastics industry are often
coated with Teflon to prevent adhesion of the resins to the
knives. Paint booths are often coated with paper or strippable
chemical coatings to eliminate the need of using harsh stripping
chemicals during paint cleanup. A very simple example of a
strippable coating is applying a light coating of hydraulic oil
to paint roll coating processing equipment exteriors to prevent
paint splatters from sticking. When dry, the paint falls to the
floor and can be swept into a dust bin. </p>
<h3>Process Water </h3>
<p>No-clean methods also apply to process chemicals such as
water. Typically, water is used one time for rinsing or cooling
prior to disposal. Often, single use of water is a serious waste
of money and natural resources. Rinse water is often clean enough
to reuse many times for rinsing or for cleaning bath makeup
water. Water usage can be reduced by up to 80% in rinse tanks by
using counter flow techniques. In counter flow rinsing or
washing, water flows from one rinse tank to the next opposite of
the direction that the components being washed are moving. In
this way, the dirtiest part comes in contact with the dirtiest
water first. After getting the most out of water for washing or
rinsing, contaminants can be filtered from the water and the
water reused. Some plating and anodizing processors have reduced
or eliminated wastewater discharges by combining water
conservation methods such as counter flow rinsing and filtration.
Common Sense Methods </p>
<p>No-clean methods can be summed up as common sense methods. If
a component is not dirty and it is prevented from becoming
contaminated, then it does not need to be cleaned. Processes and
components should be designed to eliminate or reduce the need in
order to clean to reduce cost and pollution.</p>
<h3>No-clean Check List </h3>
<p>Before cleaning, evaluate the item to be cleaned to determine
the nature of the contamination. Determine what will happen if
contaminants are not removed. Eliminate cleaning if the
contaminants are compatible with the process. If contaminants are
detrimental to the next process or will damage the component,
determine the source of the contamination and correct instead of
cleaning. If detrimental contaminants are residues or chemicals
from a previous process, determine if there are substitute
chemicals available that will not harm the process. Adjust
production schedules so that residues left on production
machinery and products are compatible with next process. If
detrimental contaminants are residues from a previous process,
determine if that process can be eliminated. If contaminants are
detrimental to the next process, determine if the next process
can be altered or eliminated so that contaminants are compatible.
Determine just how clean components need to be in order to
function. Publish cleanliness specifications for each component
or process; do not specify a particular cleaning process.
Evaluate current product design to determine if alternate designs
and materials can meet functional requirements with reduced waste
without cleaning. Remember that no-clean methods also apply to
process chemicals such as water. Use and reuse water efficiently.
Avoid spills and cleanup by installing guards, drip trays, and
proper material handling devices on production equipment. Reduce
the need to clean by using non-stick surfaces and strippable
coatings on production equipment.</p>

<p align="center"><b>MISSION STATEMENT</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Automotive Fluids Work Group</b></p>
<p>Unlike the majority of consumer liquids, in most applications
automotive fluids are not used up and therefore create a disposal
problem for people who perform self-maintenance of their
vehicles. Used oil, leaking oil filters, antifreeze, and other
automotive fluids generated by do-it-yourselfers (DIYs) can be
viewed as being both a potentially harmful threat to Georgia's
natural ecosystems and residents and as a valuable resource that
can be recovered for beneficial reuse in Georgia. </p>
<p>It is estimated that about 19 million gallons of passenger car
motor oil are sold in Georgia annually. Much of this oil is
purchased by DIYs. It is estimated that more than 5.5 million oil
filters are also bought by DIYs each year. Based on national
statistics, as much as five million gallons of used oil may be
improperly disposed of in Georgia annually. There are few places
in Georgia where consumers can take used oil, oil filters,
antifreeze, and other automotive fluids for proper disposal. </p>
<p>The mission of the Automotive Fluids Work Group is to provide
the Director of P<sup>2</sup>AD, by no later than February 28,
1996, recommendations for creating a voluntary, state-sponsored
program that will result in the proper recovery of
consumer-generated used automotive fluids and oil filters.
Recommendations shall identify types of collection sites and
methods, potential sources of program funding, and incentives for
industry and consumers. Recommendations made by the work group
are non-binding. </p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The Automotive Fluids Work Group was created by the Director
of the Pollution Prevention Assistance Division of the Georgia
Department of Natural Resources to recommend guidelines for a
state-sponsored automotive fluids management program. The work
group was made up of citizens representing a cross section of
government, trade associations, automotive fluid recyclers, and
environmental groups. The work group members are: Davis Morgan,
Chair; Ric Cobb, Rick Glendye, Larry Hart/Randy Brillhart, Della
Ridley, Kelley Coty, Carl Ferrans, Jack Kowall, Rick Cothran,
Olin Ivey, Wesley Woolf, and Bernie Deck/Paul Dickison/Steve
Grimshaw. The work group acts in an advisory capacity to the
Director. </p>
<p>The work group's mission was to provide to the Director
recommendations on the creation of a voluntary, state-sponsored
program which will result in proper recovery of
consumer-generated used automotive fluids and oil filters in
Georgia. The work group was provided with a comprehensive
research report which contained detailed information about
automotive fluids and filter management techniques, and state
programs for do-it-yourselfers (DIYs). The work group was then
asked to recommend components of a DIY management program for
Georgia, including types and methods of collection, funding, and
incentives. </p>
<p>To accomplish its mission, the work group met twice. The first
session was devoted to a series of short, informational
presentations by industry experts on various aspects of
automotive fluids management. The work group also brainstormed a
list of major issues to discuss at the next meeting. The second
meeting of the work group was a facilitated session during which
the group narrowed the issues, identified major categories, and
made specific recommendations to P<sup>2</sup>AD's Director. </p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>March 18, 1996</strong></p>
<p>A general recommendation of the work group is that any type of
DIY automotive fluids management program developed by the
Division should be voluntary. No one industry or retail group,
such as service stations, should be singled out to perform
collection of DIY-generated fluids. Rather, any responsible
entity that is interested in participating in the program should
be allowed to do so. The Division should advocate recycling and
collection programs by local governments, retailers, and
non-profits. </p>
<p>The Automotive Fluids Work Group recommends the following, in
no particular order, to be components of the DIY automotive
fluids management program developed by the Division. </p>
<p><em>Category # 1 - Collection of Automotive Fluids and Filters
generated by DIYs</em></p>
<p>The Division should &quot;benchmark&quot; all existing DIY
collection locations and automotive fluid markets within the
state in order to identify areas that may now be under-served by
consumer collection programs or have inadequate capacity for
proper handling of the fluids. Collection should, above all other
things, be convenient to the consumer. Collection locations could
include, but are not limited to, the following: various retailers
such as quick lube shops and full service stations, oil jobbers,
private firms, sites sponsored by local governments or
non-profits, and anyone who sells oil. Collection sites should be
manned. The Division should advertise the location of DIY
collection sites in some way. The Division should also encourage
DIY used automotive fluid collection as part of other existing
recycling programs. </p>
<p><em>Category # 2 - Laws and Legislation</em></p>
<p>The work group states that existing laws affecting used
automotive fluids and filters should be enforced by the proper
authorities, particularly in the case of DIYs. Consumers should
be given some sense of their own liability for improper disposal.
Additionally, the group recommends that P<sup>2</sup>AD should
sponsor legislation to promote antifreeze recycling within
Georgia. If legislation is deemed necessary by the Director to
enable proper management of DIY-generated used oil and other
automotive fluids, model language developed by the American
Petroleum Institute could be used as a starting point for
drafting legislation. </p>
<p><em>Category # 3 - Funding of an Automotive Fluids Management
Program </em></p>
<p>A large amount of funding may not be necessary, as collection
of DIY-generated used automotive fluids is already taking place
in Georgia. However, the work group, in general, supports the
idea of some type of fee on oil to fund a DIY automotive fluids
management program. Any fee collected should be reasonable, not
concentrated on the retailer, and have low administrative costs.
Possible funding sources identified by the work group include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Fee only on small amounts of oil sold (i.e. quarts) </li>
    <li>Fee on oil from first transaction (i.e. entry into the
        state) </li>
    <li>Redirection of state funds from existing programs or
        trust funds</li>
    <li>Combination of user fees and state government money </li>
    <li>Fee on other automotive fluids in addition to oil</li>
    <li>Small fee on yearly vehicle registrations or drivers'
        license renewals </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Category # 4 - Liability</em> </p>
<p>Concerns about liability issues regarding collection of
consumer-generated automotive fluids are problematic. P<sup>2</sup>AD
should attempt to address and clarify legislation and regulation
pertaining to automotive fluids to resolve liability issues. The
work group recommended that some measure be taken to limit
liability for collectors, such as the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Trust fund to ensure limited liability in case of a
        contaminated load of fluids </li>
    <li>Legislative reduction in liability for collectors who
        meet acceptable standards</li>
    <li>More consistent enforcement of fire codes by local
        jurisdictions </li>
    <li>Better education of retail-level collectors </li>
    <li>Production of a guidebook that clearly states regulations
        affecting a used oil collection site </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Category # 5 - Incentives</em> </p>
<p>The work group agrees that at least some retailers now collect
used automotive fluids from DIYs and in the future will continue
to do DIY collection with no additional incentives. Such
retailers now offer collection of used automotive fluids because
it is a good public relations vehicle for their company, and/or
because it increases customer traffic and purchasing in their
stores. Similarly, P<sup>2</sup>AD should determine if incentives
are necessary for the general public to encourage participation. </p>
<p>Incentives identified by the work group for the collectors
include the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Pay collectors an amount per gallon of automotive fluids
        collected, or some percentage rebate of any fee collected
        at the retail level </li>
    <li>Awards program for collectors tied to good business
        practices </li>
    <li>State promotion and advertising for collectors </li>
    <li>Provide money to collectors to purchase a tank so DIY oil
        can be segregated</li>
    <li>Provide money to collection sites based on participation
        rates</li>
    <li>Give money to local governments to purchase collection
        tanks and set up local education programs</li>
    <li>Limitation of liability and/or reduction of regulation,
        as discussed in Category # 4 </li>
</ul>
<p>Incentives identified by the work group for consumers and DIYs
include the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Finder's fee for DIYs who bring in automotive fluids and
        filters to be recycled </li>
    <li>Coupons for money off at local businesses and restaurants</li>
    <li>Giveaway of small amount of oil or discount on purchase
        of oil when DIY brings a certain amount of used oil in
        for collection</li>
    <li>Having convenient collection sites </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Category # 6 - Education</em> </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should establish a comprehensive education
program to promote collection of used DIY-generated automotive
fluids and filters in the state. The Division should consider
education of consumers, DIYs, retailers, and collectors. However,
education efforts should not take place until there are
sufficient disposal options available. Possible components of an
education program in Georgia are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Simple brochure to educate DIYs about proper disposal of
        used automotive fluids and where they are collected</li>
    <li>Training program in each county </li>
    <li>Video</li>
    <li>1-800 hotline number </li>
    <li>List information in appropriate publications </li>
    <li>Distribute educational information through elementary or
        high schools </li>
    <li>Develop appropriate public service announcements,
        handouts, and posters </li>
    <li>Get a high profile spokesperson (i.e. race car driver) to
        promote proper disposal of automotive fluids </li>
    <li>Privatize or at least partner with private industry to
        promote automotive fluid recycling </li>
    <li>Require signage in all automotive sale areas indicating
        the nearest location for collection of used fluids</li>
    <li>Require labels on automotive fluid containers to have
        information about the state's program</li>
    <li>Adopt an official symbol to denote collection locations
        state-wide</li>
    <li>Give out educational flyers with car tag renewals, at
        auto emission inspection facilities, at point of oil
        sale, at car dealers and car repair shops, or in utility
        bills </li>
    <li>Solicit oil companies to include information about proper
        disposal in their advertising </li>
    <li>Disseminate information about proper disposal during
        driver's education training</li>

<p align="center"><strong>MISSION STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Household Hazardous Waste Work Group</strong></p>
<p>Approximately 2.4 million households in Georgia generate more
than 5.1 million tons of solid waste each year, most of which is
disposed in solid waste landfills. Approximately 0.3 - 0.5
percent of that waste may be hazardous to human health or the
environment (EPA, Proceedings of the 4th National Conference on
Household Hazardous Waste Management, February 1990). In
addition, an unknown quantity of household hazardous waste is
improperly disposed of by pouring into storm drains, dumping on
the ground, etc. A mission of the Pollution Prevention Assistance
Division (P<sup>2</sup>AD) of the Georgia Department of Natural
Resources is to instill within the public a pollution prevention
ethic which is consistent with the protection of human health and
the environment. While hazardous waste generated by households is
exempt from environmental regulations in Georgia, the issue of
how best to properly manage household hazardous products and
reduce waste is of growing concern. Household hazardous wastes of
concern are unused or contaminated consumer products such as
paints, stains, and varnishes; cleaners; pesticides, fungicides,
and herbicides; solvents; used motor oil and other automotive
fluids; and, spent household batteries.</p>
<p>The mission of the Household Hazardous Waste Work Group is to
provide the Director of P<sup>2</sup>AD with recommendations on
the feasibility of a state-sponsored program which will result in
a reduction in household hazardous waste generation in Georgia.
If it recommends that a state-sponsored program should be
established, the Work Group shall propose a list of programs and
activities. Recommendations should include the approximate cost
of implementation. Recommendations made by the work group are
non-binding. To accomplish its mission, the Work Group should
review household hazardous waste reduction and management
programs in other states, evaluate the body of literature on the
subject, and solicit public opinion and comment.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The Household Hazardous Waste Work Group was created by the
Director of the Pollution Prevention Assistance Division of the
Georgia Department of Natural Resources to recommend guidelines
for a state-sponsored Household Hazardous Waste Prevention and
Management (HHWPM) program. The work group acted in an advisory
capacity to the Director.</p>
<p>The work group's mission was to provide to the Director
recommendations on the feasibility of a state-sponsored program
which will result in a reduction in household hazardous waste
(HHW) generation in the state. The work group was asked to review
HHW reduction and management programs in other states and to
evaluate the body of literature on the subject. The work group
was also to recommend a list of actions and activities that could
potentially constitute the development of a state HHWPM program.</p>
<p>To accomplish its mission, the work group was divided into
three smaller study groups. The Issues &amp; Priorities group
focused on the issues of liability, effect of regulations, and
possible funding sources for a state-sponsored HHWPM program. The
Residuals Management group discussed management strategy for HHW
once it enters the waste stream, while the Source Reduction group
focused on education programs for consumers to reduce the amount
of household hazardous products (HHP) entering the waste stream.
These three study groups met a total of nine times over a three
month period. Additionally, the total work group met three times,
and the chair and study group chairs met twice as a small group. </p>
<p>The work group was made up of 15 citizens representing a cross
section of government, trade associations, and environmental
groups. The work group members were Thea Powell, Chair; Rick
Foote, Vice-Chair; Don Cargill, Lynn Cobb, Ric Cobb, Rick
Cothran, Mark Eisen, Steve Emmons, Olin Ivey, Linda Jones, Kathy
Kuzava, Carol Monell, Reuben Sherrill, Susan Varlamoff, and Dee
West.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>September 22, 1995</strong></p>
<p>An overarching recommendation of the work group is that the
Pollution Prevention Assistance Division should be given
responsibility to serve as the lead organization in the state for
household hazardous waste (HHW) matters. The Division should
serve as a state-wide information clearinghouse and coordination
center for HHW, although it should not directly operate HHW
programs. The Division's programs should clearly emphasize the
difference between household hazardous products (HHP) and HHW.
Once the consumer no longer has a need for the product, then it
becomes a waste. Additionally, the Division should adopt the EPA
definition of household hazardous waste, as follows: HHW is A.
generated by individuals on the premises of a residence for
individuals and composed primarily of materials found in the
wastes generated by consumers in their homes, and B. Listed as
hazardous waste in 40 CFR, Parts 261.33 (e) or (f), or hazardous
by characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity,
and/or extraction procedure toxicity.</p>
<p>The HHW Work Group recommends the following, in no particular
order, to be components of the HHW program developed by the
Division.</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 1 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote
legislation to establish a HHW prevention and management program
in Georgia.</h4>
<p>Item # 1 </p>
<p>The Division should promote legislation that will create a
fund to provide financial support to local governments and other
groups in the state who wish to sponsor HHWPM programs. The
funding sources could be any one or a combination of the
following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>landfill tipping fees</li>
    <li>percentage of waste facility receipts </li>
    <li>hazardous waste generator fees</li>
    <li>local government surcharge, i.e. surcharge on water/sewer
        bills</li>
    <li>local government revenue surcharge on selected household
        hazardous products </li>
    <li>donated services.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Division should establish written criteria for grant funds
in support of HHWPM programs. These criteria should encourage the
creation of public/private partnerships, and allow for funds to
be used for stand alone education programs or comprehensive
education/collection programs.</p>
<p>Item # 2</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote legislation that would
encourage inclusion of questions regarding proper HHW
disposal/recycling practices on various types of licensing
renewals in Georgia. For example, a question about used motor oil
recycling could be included on drivers' license renewal forms.</p>
<p>Item # 3</p>
<p>The Division should conduct further investigation into other
state or federal laws regarding labeling of hazardous household
products. The work group agrees that manufacturers are more
likely to respond to a &quot;carrot&quot; rather than a
&quot;stick&quot; approach. Therefore, P<sup>2</sup>AD should
monitor developments regarding labeling laws, and should work
with other states and the EPA Labeling Task Force to encourage
appropriate labeling legislation.</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 2 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop
guidelines for conducting Household Hazardous Waste Prevention
and Management programs.</h4>
<p>These guidelines could be in the form of a document designed
as a comprehensive guidebook for distribution to any organization
interested in sponsoring HHWPM educational and/or collection
programs. The guidebook should recognize that public, private,
and non-profit organizations are capable of sponsoring HHWPM
programs; however, special consideration should be given to
programs that are sponsored or co-sponsored by private entities.</p>
<p>The guidebook should provide, but not be limited to the
following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Approved list of technical and education resources about
        household hazardous products and waste</li>
    <li>Liability issues for consideration before implementation</li>
    <li>Priority listing of HHW based on toxicity and economics
        of collection</li>
    <li>Guidelines and recommendations for various HHWPM programs
        - i.e., implementing an education program, and holding a
        materials exchange in conjunction with a collection
        event.</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff should be trained as a resource to work with
organizations as they use the guidebook to establish HHWPM
programs.</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 3 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote pollution
prevention of HHW through education of the public with a variety
of programs.</h4>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop targeted educational materials
through a variety of media, including: TV public service
announcements; radio spots; newspaper ads; distribution of
materials through the local Clean &amp; Beautiful chapters,
Cooperative Extension Service, and other applicable networks;
fact sheets; press releases; and/or flyers. All materials should
emphasize source reduction as the preferred management option for
HHW. Educational materials designed for teachers to incorporate
into their existing curricula should also be developed.</p>
<p>Consumer-oriented materials should educate buyers on the
environmental effects of HHP and the importance of purchasing
only the quantity needed. If disposal is required then emphasis
is placed on the most environmentally appropriate method. The
Division should be involved in educating the manufacturer,
consumer, and retailer about life-cycle analysis of products.
Additionally, the Division should do more study and have more
dialog with target audiences regarding life-cycle analysis and
other issues regarding HHW that are heavily affected by
manufacturers' attitudes and business pressures, such as
labeling, packaging, etc.</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 4 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should (as funds are
available) fund several pilot HHW collection programs in the
state.</h4>
<p>The work group agreed that collection is an important part of
HHW management, but it is desirable to gather some limited data
on collection in Georgia prior to making any decisions regarding
funding for a full-scale collection program. Division-approved
pilot programs should be located in several different areas of
the state, with an emphasis on events that can provide
information to the state regarding the feasibility of varying
types of collection events (urban vs. rural areas, types of
materials collected, etc.).</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 5 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should create and/or
promote collection for certain HHW items.</h4>
<p>Item #1</p>
<p>Citizens should be encouraged to follow the waste management
hierarchy: Purchase only what is needed, and use up all of the
product to avoid the need for recycling or disposal. Collection
and disposal of HHW items should be limited to those items that
cannot be donated, recycled, recovered, or safely disposed of in
a municipal landfill or down the drain. These items include
banned pesticides, oil-based paints and paints containing heavy
metals, wood preservatives, dioxins, and pool chemicals.</p>
<p>Item #2</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote and support private sector
efforts by retailers, manufacturers, and other stakeholders for
proper recycling or energy recovery of certain items, such as
motor oil, antifreeze, brake fluid, oil filters, latex paint,
solvents, paint thinners, strippers, non-alkaline household
batteries, fluorescent light bulbs, and thermometers. As these
private sector efforts will be impacted by EPA's Universal Waste
Rule, the Division should be involved in the planning process for
state authorization of that Rule.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>MISSION STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Recognition Criteria Work Group </strong></p>
<p>The Pollution Prevention Assistance Division (P<sup>2</sup>AD)
of the Department of Natural Resources was created to develop
programs and activities which encourage Georgia industries to
implement sound pollution prevention programs. P<sup>2</sup>AD's
legislation establishes that participation by industry in the
Division's programs and activities is to be voluntary, and that
proprietary information and reports developed for industry will
remain confidential.</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD has learned that industry considers many
pollution control and other regulations to be a disincentive to
voluntary pollution prevention, and that awards and recognition
are incentives.</p>
<p>The mission of the Recognition Criteria Work Group (RCWG) is
to develop and recommend to the Director of P<sup>2</sup>AD
pollution prevention recognition criteria. Specifically, the work
group is to: 1) develop criteria by which a company would be
judged to have achieved a level of excellence in the development
and implementation of pollution prevention programs which would
qualify the company for a &quot;Certificate of Excellence&quot;;
2) develop criteria by which a company would be judged to have
achieved a greater level of excellence which would qualify the
company for a &quot;Governor's Award&quot;; and 3) develop both
performance criteria for rating a pollution prevention program
and a process through which the Director can request that EPA
and/or EPD reduce regulatory monitoring and reporting
requirements of a company which can verify, by independent
review, achievement of the required level of performance in
pollution prevention. </p>
<p>The above criteria can be qualitative and/or quantitative, the
same or different for each mission objective.</p>
<p>The work group is requested to review current literature on
OSHA and EPA recognition programs, work of the National Academy
of Standards, and other states' programs. The work group is
further requested to solicit and consider public input. The first
task to be completed by the work group is a work plan and
schedule.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee Thomas of Georgia Pacific, Inc. is to serve as chair
of the RCWG. Peter Bonacum, Roy Bowen, Steve O'Day, Elizabeth
Brock, Win Hill, Bob Woodall, Laurie Fowler, David Word, Rep.
Denny Dobbs, Carol Foley, Pete Howard, Bruce Miller, and Wesley
Wolff are to serve as members.</p>
<p>The work group is created by the Director of P<sup>2</sup>AD,
and is advisory to the Director. The work group is to dissolve
upon completion of its mission.</p>
<p>Bill Wells, P<sup>2</sup>AD's Public Information Director,
will serve as principal staff support to the work group and as
liaison for the Director. </p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The Recognition Criteria Work Group was created by the
Director of the Pollution Prevention Assistance Division of the
Department of Natural Resources to recommend guidelines for a
state-sponsored pollution prevention recognition program. The
work group acts in an advisory capacity to the Director.</p>
<p>The work group's mission was to recommend criteria by which a
company would be judged to have achieved a level of excellence in
the development and implementation of pollution prevention
programs. The work group was to recommend criteria by which a
company could qualify for a &quot;Governor's Award.&quot; The
work group was also to recommend a process by which the Director
can request that EPD reduce regulatory monitoring and reporting
requirements of those companies which have achieved a required
level of performance in pollution prevention and maintained
compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations.</p>
<p>To accomplish its mission, the work group held three meetings.
The members reviewed pollution prevention recognition programs in
other states, recognition programs of federal agencies, existing
pollution prevention/environmental reporting requirements in
Georgia, and components of a successful pollution prevention
program.</p>
<p>The work group was made up of 14 citizens representing a cross
section of industry, government and environmental groups. The
work group members are Lee Thomas, Chairman; Peter Bonacum, Roy
Bowen, Elizabeth Brock, Rep. Denny Dobbs, Laurie Fowler, Carol
Foley, Win Hill, Pete Howard, Bruce Miller, Steve O'Day, Wesley
Wolff, Bob Woodall and David Word.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
<p>The Recognition Criteria Work Group recommends that the
Pollution Prevention Assistance Division establish a program for
recognizing and rewarding exemplary efforts in the area of
pollution prevention. The underlying objective of the program
should be to encourage pollution prevention in Georgia industries
by recognizing companies that successfully practice pollution
prevention. The recognition program should foster a common agenda
of preventing pollution and waste, increasing efficiency and
improving the environment.</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should work with the Georgia Legislature and
environmental regulators to create meaningful incentives for
companies which practice pollution prevention. However,
incentives would not lessen or interfere with environmental laws
or rules.</p>
<p>The recognition program should not be overburdensome. Whenever
possible, P<sup>2</sup>AD should use existing required
environmental reports as a basis for determining those eligible
for recognition. A company's environmental compliance history
should be considered during the recognition evaluation process.
The program should be at the facility level.</p>
<p>These recommendations should be used as a guide as P<sup>2</sup>AD
develops the requirements of the recognition program. P<sup>2</sup>AD
should continue to involve the public in the development of the
program. In order for the recognition program to become
successful and achieve its objective of encouraging pollution
prevention, it must be embraced by industry, government and the
general public.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>CATEGORIES OF AWARDS</strong></p>
<p>The Recognition Criteria Work Group recommends the formation
of two categories of recognition: a certification program and the
Governor's Award. The certification program should recognize and
reward continuous performance and improvement. It should have
three levels of recognition based on performance and
accomplishment and be measured against criteria developed by P<sup>2</sup>AD.
The three levels in order of increased achievement are: entry,
achievement, and model. Each level would have its own specific
criteria defined by P<sup>2</sup>AD.</p>
<p>At every stage of certification, P<sup>2</sup>AD should, in
consultation with EPD, develop criteria which would establish
that the applicant company is in environmental compliance. A
company must participate in the certification program to be
eligible to participate in the Governor's Award program. The
Governor's Award program recognizes outstanding pollution
prevention projects by a company, individual, organization,
academia, or a government agency. Unlike the certification
program, the Governor's Award should be competitive.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>CERTIFICATION PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p>The certification program is comprised of three levels. Each
level is based on a company's level of commitment to, and
achievement in the area of pollution prevention. The first level
is the Entry Level. In order to be recognized as an Entry Level
participant, a company must meet certain criteria that
demonstrate their interest in, and commitment to, developing a
pollution prevention program. These criteria include the
following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An employee awareness program </li>
    <li>A clear understanding of pollution prevention </li>
    <li>Management and employee commitment </li>
    <li>Established pollution prevention goals </li>
</ul>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop a mechanism which would allow
it to determine if an applicant meets the above criteria and is
in compliance with all federal, state and local environmental
laws and regulations. Certification in the Entry Level program
would be renewable annually based on sustained performance.</p>
<p>The Achievement Level is the second level in the certification
program. The Achievement Level is designed to recognize companies
that have implemented a pollution prevention program. Companies
which obtain the Achievement Level incorporate pollution
prevention into their business activities and can demonstrate
commitment on the part of management to encourage pollution
prevention practices outside the company. A company must have
participated in the Entry Level for at least one year to be
eligible to apply for the Achievement Level. The criteria for the
Achievement Level includes the following in addition to the
criteria for the Entry Level:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Documented reductions of emissions and waste through
        pollution prevention. </li>
    <li>Accounting for all costs and benefits of the company's
        pollution prevention program. </li>
    <li>Reduced and/or more efficient use of resources. </li>
    <li>A community involvement/outreach program. </li>
</ul>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop a mechanism which will allow it
to determine if an applicant meets the above criteria and is in
compliance with all federal, state and local environmental laws
and regulations. Certification in the Achievement Level program
would be renewable annually based on sustained performance.</p>
<p>The Model Level, the third level of the certification program,
is the highest level of achievement. Companies in this category
are considered best-in-class facilities that have exemplary
pollution prevention programs and are recognized as industry
leaders and environmental stewards within their community. To
these companies pollution prevention is not just a commitment but
a practice which is incorporated into all business decisions.
Model Level participants not only instill the pollution
prevention ethic in their employees and vendors, but encourage
others in the community or their industry to incorporate
pollution prevention practices into their daily activities. After
two years at the Achievement Level, a company is eligible to
apply for the Model Level. In addition to meeting the criteria of
the Entry Level and Achievement Level, Model Level candidates
must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Foster a pollution prevention ethic that extends outside
        the boundaries of the company or facility. </li>
    <li>Employ practices that prevent the transfer of pollution
        to other facilities. </li>
    <li>Serve as a witness for pollution prevention practices to
        peers and the public. </li>
    <li>Assist other companies through pollution prevention
        technology transfer. </li>
    <li>Demonstrate a commitment to pollution prevention in
        product development and purchasing decisions. </li>
</ul>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop a mechanism which will allow it
to determine if an applicant meets the above criteria and is in
compliance with all federal, state and local environmental laws
and regulations. Certification in the Model program would be
renewable annually based on sustained performance.</p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Application Process</u></strong></p>
<p>Applications for the certification program should be accepted
year round. After receiving the application, the staff should
determine if the company meets the established criteria. Upon
approval, the company's compliance history should be reviewed.
Companies which have favorable compliance histories will receive
a letter announcing their acceptance in the certification
program. </p>
<p>Any company not wishing to continue to participate in the
program may withdraw. </p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Qualifications</u></strong></p>
<p>The certification program is open to any company that is
located in Georgia. A company or organization interested in
participating should submit an application. A company or
organization could be nominated by another party. Pollution
prevention projects and programs should address all media types
(i.e., air, solid waste, water). </p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Forms of Recognition</u></strong></p>
<p>Companies that achieve certification should be publicly
recognized. P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop a method for informing
the public of the certified company's achievement. Companies that
reach the Achievement Level or Model Level should be eligible for
some type of regulatory and/or financial incentives in the form
of reduced fees, expedited permitting or reduced reporting or
inspections. P<sup>2</sup>AD should consult with EPD to develop
regulatory incentives. If necessary, P<sup>2</sup>AD and EPD
should propose legislation to provide for regulatory incentives.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>GOVERNOR'S AWARD PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p>The Governor's Award for pollution prevention should recognize
special and significant pollution prevention achievements of
companies and organizations in Georgia.</p>
<p>The Governor's Award unlike the certification recognition
program should be an annual competitive award given to a company,
individual, or organization that has demonstrated excellence in
pollution prevention. A company should have participated in the
certification program at some level to be eligible for the annual
Governor's Award. This criteria would not apply to individuals,
academia, non-profit organizations or government. The award
should be presented in three categories. These categories should
be small and medium business, large business, and community
(private/individual/organization/government). There should be no
limits on the number of honorable mention certificates presented.</p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Application Process</u></strong></p>
<p>The application process for the Governor's Award should be
similar to that of the certification recognition program. The
first step should be a screening of all applicants to eliminate
those which are not eligible. P<sup>2</sup>AD should also review
the applicant's compliance history where applicable. Qualified
applications should be judged by a panel of judges including
industry peers and representatives from relevant state agencies
and universities. </p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Qualifications</u></strong></p>
<p>All eligible projects should have occurred during the calendar
year; or in the case of ongoing programs, new activities should
have occurred during the calendar year. Prior recipients are
eligible to compete for the Governor's Award the following year,
although the project must differ from the previous entry. Only
those companies who participate in the certification program
should be eligible for the Governor's Award. This would not apply
to individuals, academia, non-profit organizations or government.</p>
<p>Reductions that are the result of a process being eliminated
or transferred to another facility out of state should not
qualify as pollution prevention activities.</p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Forms of Recognition</u></strong></p>
<p>The principal award in the Governor's Award program should be
public recognition. The award should be presented to the company
by the Governor at an annual event.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b>Pollution Prevention Partners</b></h2>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Entry Level Certification</strong></h2>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Application and Selection Process </strong></h3>
<p>To apply for the Entry Level, facilities must complete the
P&#179; Entry Level application and return it to P&#178;AD.
P&#178;AD is available, at no charge, to assist facilities in
qualifying. The forms will be reviewed at local offices of the
Georgia Tech Economic Development Institute (EDI). An EDI
representative may visit the facility to verify information. The
facility must have no outstanding environmental compliance issues
or violations with the Georgia Environmental Protection Division
(EPD). P&#178;AD will certify the facility's acceptance into the
P&#179; program at the Entry Level and provide notification.
Facilities that fail to qualify for the program will be notified
of the reason, and offered assistance in qualifying.
Certification is granted when the facility meets all Entry Level
criteria and upon approval of the application by P&#178;AD.
Certification is for one year from the date it is granted. To
assure that certification does not lapse, facilities wishing to
be recertified the following year must submit an application no
less than 30 days prior to the expiration date of the
certificate. Facilities wishing to move to a higher level may
apply at any time. </p>
<hr>
<h3><b>Qualifications</b> </h3>
<p>To qualify as an Achievement Level Pollution Prevention
Partner a facility must meet the following general requirements: </p>
<p>1. The facility must be located in Georgia. </p>
<p>2. The facility must have no outstanding compliance issues or
violations with the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. </p>
<p>3. Facilities must have pollution prevention plans with
numeric goals for reductions through pollution prevention and a
time line for achieving those goals. P&#178;AD must approve the
facility&#146;s reduction goals. <b>(P&#178;AD is available to
assist companies in developing pollution prevention plans)</b> </p>
<p>4. Only those programs and activities that meet the definition
of pollution prevention will be considered.</p>
<p>(Pollution prevention is defined by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) as &#147;the use of materials, processes,
and practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants
or wastes at the source.&#148; Examples of pollution prevention
activities include inventory management/purchasing procedures,
source reduction, process modifications, housekeeping/good
operating practices, material substitutions, redesign of product,
pollution prevention education/outreach, and in-process
recycling. Disposal, off site recycling or reprocessing of wastes
is not pollution prevention.)</p>
<p>5. Certified facilities must agree to allow P<sup>2</sup>AD
the opportunity to publish non-proprietary information about
their pollution prevention program. </p>
<p>To be recognized as an Entry Level Pollution Prevention
Partner, facilities must meet certain criteria that demonstrate
their interest in and commitment to establishing a formal,
facility-wide pollution prevention program. The requirements are:</p>
<p><b><u>Pollution prevention plan</u></b></p>
<p>The facility must establish a pollution prevention plan that
contains goals for reducing waste and emissions through pollution
prevention. The reduction goals will be used as criteria for
advancement in the program. P<sup>2</sup>AD must approve the
facility's reduction goals. (P<sup>2</sup>AD has model plans and
a sample Entry Level application available. P<sup>2</sup>AD is
available to assist companies in developing pollution prevention
plans.) </p>
<p><b><u>Management commitment</u></b><u> </u></p>
<p>Applicants must demonstrate management commitment to the
pollution prevention program by having the highest ranking
company officer at the facility sign the pollution prevention
plan. </p>
<p><b><u>Employee commitment</u></b><u> </u></p>
<p>Applicants must demonstrate employee commitment by creating
one or more pollution prevention teams of employees to develop
strategies for the program.</p>
<p><b><u>Employee awareness program</u></b></p>
<p>Applicants must notify employees of the facility's pollution
prevention program and motivate employees to participate. </p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Rules/Guidelines </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>Facilities must reapply yearly and show progress
            toward goals. </li>
        <li>Facilities that fail to qualify may resubmit an
            application at any time. </li>
        <li>Applications for the P&#179; program are accepted
            year round. </li>
        <li>Facilities wishing to withdraw from the program may
            do so by letter or by not reapplying the following
            year. All rewards and recognition associated with the
            company's participation in the program will be
            terminated at such time. </li>
        <li>A facility may participate at the Entry Level for no
            more than three consecutive years.</li>

<h3><strong>Section 2.0 - Pollution Prevention Plan</strong></h3>
<p>You may attach an existing plan, or use the following form
(Sections 2-4) as your plan. Existing plans must include all of
the elements requested below.</p>
<p><strong>2.1 Provide the facility's written pollution
prevention policy statement that indicates management's and
employees' commitment to preventing pollution and waste at the
source.</strong></p>
<p>This is the facility's statement indicating a commitment by
management and employees to preventing pollution at the source.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Provide a brief description of the facility's
operations. </strong>(If available, provide a process flow
diagram)</p>
<p>Describe what product(s) is made at the facility and what
processes are used to make the product(s).</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Waste stream identification, facility production
and reduction goals.</strong></p>
<p>The following chart is designed to help establish a baseline
year for measuring reductions. Identify the waste streams that
your facility generates and establish production for the baseline
year. Not all facilities generate waste in each category.
Establish reduction goals, by percentage, for the following year
and for the long-term. The projected year for achieving the
long-term goals must be included.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 Facility waste stream and reduction goals chart.</strong></p>
<p>At top of the table, enter a baseline year (1995 or earlier).
For each type of waste (hazardous, wastewater, air emissions, and
solid waste), enter the following information:</p>
<p><em>Column 1</em> - No entry necessary.</p>
<p><em>Column 2</em> - Enter the source(s) of each type of waste
generated. If no waste of the type listed in column 1 is
generated, enter None and go to next row. Example sources include
painting and cleaning operations, materials past expiration date
for hazardous wastes, potable water or process water for
wastewater sources, boiler or paint booth for air emissions, and
pallets, scrap steel, office paper for solid waste sources. </p>
<p><em>Column 3</em> - Enter the total amount of waste generated
in the baseline year for each category of waste. Use units of
pounds for hazardous waste and air emissions, gallons for
wastewater, and tons for total solid waste.</p>
<p><em>Column 4 </em>- Enter baseline year production in specific
units. Product quantities or dollar values are preferred. Example
units include automobiles, linear feet of pipe, number of
employees, annual sales, gallons of cleaning chemicals. Beyond
the entry level, production numbers will be used to normalize
waste reduction percentages based on production levels.</p>
<p><em>Column 5</em> - For each category of waste, enter your
reduction goal for calendar year 1996 versus your waste
generation in the baseline year. </p>
<p>1996 Reduction goal = (1996 waste generation/Baseline year
waste generation)x 100 (%) </p>
<p><em>Column 6</em> - For each category of waste, enter your
long term reduction goal versus your waste generation in the
baseline year. Also enter the year that you propose achieving
this goal by.</p>
<p>LT Reduction goal = (LT waste generation/Baseline year waste
generation)x 100 (%) </p>
<p>Your long term reduction goal will be used as a metric in
applying for Achievement Level and Model Level Certification in
the Pollution Prevention Partners program. </p>
<p>For each type of waste, enter a short description of potential
methods for minimizing wastes through pollution prevention.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b>Pollution Prevention Partners</b></h2>
<h2 align="center"><b>Achievement Level Certification</b> </h2>
<hr>
<h3><b>Application and Selection Process</b> </h3>
<p>To apply for the Achievement Level, facilities must complete
the P&#179; Achievement Level application and return it to
P&#178;AD. <b>P&#178;AD is available, at no charge, to assist
facilities in qualifying.</b> The forms will be reviewed at local
offices of the Georgia Tech Economic Development Institute (EDI).
An EDI representative may visit the facility to verify
information. </p>
<p>To be eligible for a reduction in fees, the facility must have
no outstanding environmental compliance issues or violations, and
be approved by EPD. After being notified that a facility has
applied for acceptance in the P&#179; program, each EPD Branch
will check the applicant&#146;s files. If the applicant has no
files or no violations documented during the previous 12 months,
the applicant will be certified as eligible for the P&#179;
program. If the applicant had a violation, the Branch will
determine if it was resolved expeditiously. If so, the
application will be certified. If the violation is unresolved or
if the applicant was resistant in resolving, the application will
not be certified. </p>
<p>P&#178;AD will certify the facility&#146;s acceptance into the
P&#179; program at the Achievement Level and provide
notification. Facilities that fail to qualify for Achievement
Level status will be notified of the reason, and offered
assistance in qualifying. </p>
<p>Certification is granted when the facility meets all
Achievement Level criteria, EPD file review and upon approval of
the application by P&#178;AD. Certification is for one year from
the date it is granted. To assure that certification does not
lapse, facilities wishing to be recertified the following year
must submit an application no less than 30 days prior to the
expiration date of the certificate. Facilities wishing to move to
a higher level may apply at any time. </p>
<hr>
<h3><b>Qualifications</b> </h3>
<p>To qualify as an Achievement Level Pollution Prevention
Partner a facility must meet the following general requirements: </p>
<p>1. The facility must be located in Georgia. </p>
<p>2. The facility must have no outstanding compliance issues or
violations with the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. </p>
<p>3. Facilities must have pollution prevention plans with
numeric goals for reductions through pollution prevention and a
time line for achieving those goals. P&#178;AD must approve the
facility&#146;s reduction goals. <b>(P&#178;AD is available to
assist companies in developing pollution prevention plans)</b> </p>
<p>4. Only those programs and activities that meet the definition
of pollution prevention will be considered. </p>
<p>(Pollution prevention is defined by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) as &#147;the use of materials, processes,
and practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants
or wastes at the source.&#148; Examples of pollution prevention
activities include inventory management/purchasing procedures,
source reduction, process modifications, housekeeping/good
operating practices, material substitutions, redesign of product,
pollution prevention education/outreach, and in-process
recycling. Disposal, off site recycling or reprocessing of wastes
is not pollution prevention.)</p>
<p>5. Certified facilities must agree to allow P<sup>2</sup>AD
the opportunity to publish non-proprietary information about
their pollution prevention program. </p>
<p>To be recognized as an Achievement Level Pollution Prevention
Partner, a facility must meet criteria that demonstrate a
pollution prevention program is in place and achieving
reductions. The requirements are: </p>
<p><b><u>Pollution prevention reductions</u></b><u> </u></p>
<p>The facility must have in place a pollution prevention plan
with stated reduction goals (goals must be approved by
P&#178;AD). The facility must achieve 25 percent of reduction
goals from the baseline year stated in its pollution prevention
plan. Facilities must demonstrate reductions in all categories of
waste generated at the facility. (E.g., Facilities with four
categories of waste must show reductions in each category - solid
waste, hazardous waste, air emissions and wastewater/water usage.
Facilities with three categories of waste must show reductions in
each category.) Reductions achieved only through pollution
prevention, as defined above, will qualify. Facilities must
report cost savings, if any, related to reductions. </p>
<p><b><u>Management commitment</u></b><u> </u></p>
<p>The facility&#146;s pollution prevention plan must be fully
developed and available in written form. The pollution prevention
plan must be incorporated in whole, in part or by reference into
the facility&#146;s business plan or plan of operation. </p>
<p><b><u>Outreach</u></b><u> </u></p>
<p>Applicants must inform citizens in the surrounding community
of the facility&#146;s pollution prevention program and encourage
pollution prevention in the community. <b>(P&#178;AD has model
Outreach plans available)</b> </p>
<hr>
<h3><b>Rules/Guidelines</b> </h3>
<p>1. Facilities must reapply yearly and show progress toward
reduction goals. </p>
<p>2. Facilities that fail to qualify may resubmit an
application. </p>
<p>3. Applications for the P&#179; program are accepted year
round. </p>
<p>4. Facilities wishing to withdraw from the program may do so
by letter or by not reapplying the following year. All rewards
and recognition associated with the company&#146;s participation
in the program will be terminated at such time. </p>
<p>5. Facilities may apply for Achievement Level status if they
have been an Entry Level Pollution Prevention Partner for at
least one year. Facilities may also apply for the Achievement
Level if they have met Entry Level criteria for at least one
year. </p>
<p>6. Facilities must meet Entry Level criteria in addition to
Achievement Level criteria. </p>
<p>7. Applications must be certified by a Professional Engineer. </p>
<p>8. Facilities receiving a reduction in fees must sign a
statement acknowledging that those funds have been, or will be,
applied to the facility&#146;s pollution prevention activities. </p>
<p>9. To qualify for a reduction in fees, Large Quantity
Generators of hazardous waste must demonstrate a reduction in
hazardous waste generation. </p>
<p>10. To qualify for a reduction in fees, facilities with
reported releases defined in Section 313 of SARA Title III must
demonstrate a reduction in reported releases. </p>
<p>11. Facilities applying for a reduction in fees for the second
year must achieve 30 percent of overall reduction goals. </p>
<p>12. Facilities applying for a reduction in fees for the third
year must achieve 35 percent of overall reduction goals. </p>
<p>13. A facility may participate at the Achievement Level for no
more than five consecutive years. </p>
<p>14. Applicants must inform citizens in the surrounding
community that the facility has applied to be a Pollution
Prevention Partner. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b>Pollution Prevention Partners</b></h2>
<h2 align="center"><b>Model Level Certification</b> </h2>
<hr>
<h3><b>Application and Selection Process</b> </h3>
<p>To apply for the Model Level, facilities must complete the
P&#179; Model Level application and return it to P&#178;AD.<b>
P&#178;AD is available, at no charge, to assist facilities in
qualifying.</b> The forms will be reviewed at local offices of
the Georgia Tech Economic Development Institute (EDI). An EDI
representative may visit the facility to verify information. </p>
<p>To be eligible for a reduction in fees, the facility must have
no outstanding environmental compliance issues or violations, and
be approved by EPD. After being notified that a facility has
applied for acceptance in the P&#179; program, each EPD Branch
will check the applicant&#146;s files. If the applicant has no
files or no violations documented during the previous 12 months,
the applicant will be certified as eligible for the P&#179;
program. If the applicant had a violation, the Branch will
determine if it was resolved expeditiously. If so, the
application will be certified. If the violation is unresolved or
if the applicant was resistant in resolving, the application will
not be certified. </p>
<p>P&#178;AD will certify the facility&#146;s acceptance into the
P&#179; program at the Model Level and provide notification.
Facilities that fail to qualify for Model Level status will be
notified of the reason, and offered assistance in qualifying. </p>
<p>Certification is granted when the facility meets all Model
Level criteria, EPD file review and upon approval of the
application by P&#178;AD. Certification is for one year from the
date it is granted. To assure that certification does not lapse,
facilities wishing to be recertified the following year must
submit an application no less than 30 days prior to the
expiration date of the certificate. Facilities wishing to move to
a higher level may apply at any time. </p>
<hr>
<h3><b>Qualifications</b> </h3>
<p>To qualify as a Model Level Pollution Prevention Partner a
facility must meet the following general requirements: </p>
<p>1. The facility must be located in Georgia. </p>
<p>2. The facility must have no outstanding compliance issues or
violations with the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. </p>
<p>3. Facilities must have pollution prevention plans with
numeric goals for reductions through pollution prevention and a
time line for achieving those goals. P&#178;AD must approve the
facility&#146;s reduction goals. <b>(P&#178;AD is available to
assist companies in developing pollution prevention plans)</b> </p>
<p>4. Only those programs and activities that meet the definition
of pollution prevention will be considered. </p>
<p>(Pollution prevention is defined by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) as &#147;the use of materials, processes,
and practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants
or wastes at the source.&#148; Examples of pollution prevention
activities include inventory management/purchasing procedures,
source reduction, process modifications, housekeeping/good
operating practices, material substitutions, redesign of product,
pollution prevention education/outreach, and in-process
recycling. Disposal, off site recycling or reprocessing of wastes
is not pollution prevention.)</p>
<p>5. Certified facilities must agree to allow P<sup>2</sup>AD
the opportunity to publish non-proprietary information about
their pollution prevention program. </p>
<p>To be recognized as a Model Level Pollution Prevention
Partner, facilities must meet Entry Level and Achievement Level
requirements and the following additional criteria: </p>
<p><b><u>Pollution prevention reductions</u></b><u> </u></p>
<p>The facility must have in place a pollution prevention plan
with stated reduction goals (goals must be approved by
P&#178;AD). The facility must achieve 50 percent of overall
reduction goals from the baseline year as stated in its pollution
prevention plan. Facilities must demonstrate reductions in all
categories of waste generated at the facility and improved
efficiencies in the use of utilities and water. (E.g., Facilities
with four categories of waste must show reductions in each
category - solid waste, hazardous waste, air emissions and waste
water. Facilities with three categories of waste must show
reductions in each category.) Reductions achieved only through
pollution prevention, as defined above, will qualify. Facilities
must also report cost savings, if any, related to reductions. </p>
<p><b><u>External pollution prevention practices</u></b><u> </u></p>
<p>The facility must show how it is promoting pollution
prevention to its clients and vendors. The facility must show
that its efforts to prevent pollution do not cause the transfer
of pollution to other facilities. The facility must show that it
is promoting pollution prevention in its industry. </p>
<p><b><u>Purchasing and Product Development</u></b> </p>
<p>The facility must show that it has incorporated pollution
prevention in its purchasing practices, and, if applicable, in
the development of new products. </p>
<hr>
<h3><b>Rules/Guidelines</b> </h3>
<p>1. Facilities must reapply yearly and show progress toward
reduction goals. </p>
<p>2. Facilities that fail to qualify may resubmit an
application. </p>
<p>3. Applications for the P&#179; program are accepted year
round. </p>
<p>4. Facilities wishing to withdraw from the program may do so
by letter or by not reapplying the following year. All rewards
and recognition associated with the company&#146;s participation
in the program will be terminated at such time. </p>
<p>5. Facilities may apply for Model Level status if they have
been an Achievement Level Pollution Prevention Partner for at
least two years. Facilities may also apply for this level if they
have met Achievement Level criteria for at least two years. </p>
<p>6. Facilities must meet Entry Level and Achievement Level
criteria in addition to Model Level criteria. </p>
<p>7. Applications must be certified by a Professional Engineer. </p>
<p>8. Facilities receiving a reduction in fees must sign a
statement acknowledging that those funds have been, or will be,
applied to pollution prevention activities. </p>
<p>9. To qualify for a reduction in fees, Large Quantity
Generators of hazardous waste must demonstrate a reduction in
hazardous waste generation. </p>
<p>10. To qualify for a reduction in fees, facilities with
reported releases defined in Section 313 of SARA Title III must
demonstrate a reduction in reported releases. </p>
<p>11. Facilities applying for a reduction in fees for the second
year must achieve 60 percent of overall reduction goals. </p>
<p>12. Facilities applying for a reduction in fees for the third
year must achieve 70 percent of overall reduction goals. </p>
<p>13. Facilities may participate at the Model Level status
indefinitely. </p>
<p>14. Applicants must inform citizens in the surrounding
community that the facility has applied to be a Pollution
Prevention Partner. </p>

<hr>
<p>As P<sup>2</sup>AD continues to expand and refine the
technical assistance programs of the Division, our discussions
with those of you in industry have been quite helpful as we plan
future programs. Thanks to all of you who have called, stopped by
our booth at a recent exposition, or (better yet) used our
services! These many conversations, coupled with the data we
obtained from the industry survey conducted for us by Georgia
State University last summer, have shown us that businesses want
technical information and training focused on specific topics of
interest to them, as opposed to general pollution prevention
topics. Additionally, our recent industrial sector prioritization
and analysis efforts (as profiled in the last newsletter) have
identified solvent usage as a key issue for a variety of
businesses in the state. In response to this issue, as well as
the need for very focused training information, and the impending
deadlines imposed by the Montreal Protocol, the Division will be
sponsoring a solvent alternatives conference in Atlanta on June
29th. The conference is being planned in cooperation with the
Georgia Tech Research Institute; more specific information and a
registration form can be found elsewhere in this newsletter.</p>
<p>The June 29th conference also builds on some earlier workshops
conducted by the Division, specifically the January 1994 Solvent
Substitution Conference and the October 1994 Airline/Aircraft
Conference. I encourage those of you who attended these past
conferences to make plans to attend on June 29th; new information
will be presented, additional vendors will be represented, and
there will be ample opportunity to network with your peers. For
those of you who haven't attended our conferences or workshops in
the past, please consider attending this one and learning more
about P<sup>2</sup>AD and solvent alternatives.</p>
<p>This issue of From the Source is also an attempt to provide
our readers with technical information focused on one specific
subject area--in this case, solvent usage and alternatives.
Please let us know what you think about having the newsletter
focus on aspects of a particular issue. You may address any
comments to Jancie Hatcher at (404) 651-5120 or 1-800-685-2443.</p>

<h4>Industry Helping Industry</h4>
<p>What do a printer and a military base have in common? Plenty -
Both are located in Georgia; both use solvents; both have a
strong commitment to preventing pollution; and both use rags.</p>
<p>When I envisioned the direction of this Division, industry
helping industry was certainly one desirable goal. Not only have
companies in this state shared their case studies at workshops,
but also in direct consultation efforts, for example, Williams
Printing Co. opened its door to share their ideas and success
story on a one-to-one basis.</p>
<p>Robins Air Force Base (AFB), in their continual commitment to
pollution prevention, decided to investigate rag disposal
alternatives using the resources and expertise of P<sup>2</sup>AD.
Thanks to the willingness of Williams, Robins AFB was able to see
first-hand how to use a centrifuge to recover solvent from rags
as an alternative to their current rag disposal method. Williams
clearly demonstrated the benefits of using a centrifuge to
recover solvents, even though Robins AFB generates several
thousand more pounds of rags contaminated with solvent than
Williams. During the visit, engineers at Williams discussed both
the problems and costs associated with implementing the new
system, as well as the environmental and financial benefits of
recovering the solvents and reusing the rags. The staff at Robins
took the opportunity to ask questions about the design of the
system, so that they could determine the feasibility of
implementing a similar process. </p>
<p>This is an example of what I hope will grow into a network of
industries in this state that are willing to share information,
thereby enhancing the profitability, productivity, and pollution
prevention activities of all involved. P<sup>2</sup>AD is
available to facilitate other similar exchanges in the future.</p>
<h4>A Note of Thanks</h4>
<p>As you read on the front page, the Recognition Criteria Work
Group has created a draft report of their recommendation to
develop a Recognition Program. Once the staff has formalized the
program, it will be one of the best in the country, going well
beyond the typical recognition program to one that rewards the
high achievements of companies that participate. I am excited
about the possibilities that this type of program could create in
our state; acting as a catalyst to encourage pollution prevention
practices among Georgia businesses.</p>
<p>And finally I would like to express my appreciation to the
fifteen members who participated in the Work Group and developed
these exceptional recommendations upon which the foundation of
the recognition program will be built. The members include: Lee
Thomas, Chairman, Peter Bonacum, Roy Bowen, Elizabeth Brock,
Representative Denny Dobbs, Carol Foley, Laurie Fowler, Win Hill,
Pete Howard, Bruce Miller, Steve O'Day, Wesley Wolff, Bob
Woodall, and David Word.&#160;</p>

<h3><b>SERA Partnership Formed</b></h3>
<p>From the very beginning of P<sup>2</sup>AD's operation, the
Division has leveraged outside resources whenever possible to
accomplish its mission. This approach has used innovative
public-private partnerships with the university system, trade
associations, and federal and state agencies to maximize the
effectiveness of our pollution prevention efforts in Georgia. In
fact, maximizing the use of existing resources is one of the
Division's core strategies, and P<sup>2</sup>AD's goal is to
continue to acquire appropriate partners in both the public and
private sectors. In furtherance of this goal, I am pleased to
announce our partnership on behalf of the State of Georgia with
the Southeastern Environmental Resources Alliance (SERA). SERA is
a non-profit organization set up to provide environmental
information, technical assistance, and other related services to
small and medium-sized businesses in Georgia and South Carolina.
SERA will also be involved in technology transfer of waste
management technologies from the Savannah River Site. We are
excited about this partnership for a number of reasons, but
particularly because it will enhance our ability to provide
technical assistance to industries and businesses in the state.
We will be including more details in the newsletter as the
specifics of this partnership develop. For now, see the <a
href="Sera.htm">article</a> on the front page for some initial
information about SERA.</p>
<h3><b>Trucking Best Management Practices Workshop Held</b></h3>
<p>In October P<sup>2</sup>AD, in cooperation with the Georgia
Motor Trucking Association (GMTA) and the American Trucking
Association (ATA), sponsored a very successful one-day workshop
at Clayton State College. The workshop reviewed stormwater best
management practices and pollution prevention techniques
applicable to trucking and fleet maintenance operations. P<sup>2</sup>AD
is very appreciative of the excellent work that ATA and GMTA
performed in conducting this workshop. We particularly want to
thank Karen Medlin of ATA for her efforts in coordinating the
day's activities. See the <a href="Truck.htm">article</a> on the
next page for details of the workshop and a special free video
offer.</p>
<h3><b>Automotive Fluids Work Group to be Formed</b></h3>
<p>As many of you are aware, during 1995 P<sup>2</sup>AD
sponsored a work group that made recommendations to me regarding
a state-sponsored household hazardous waste (HHW) program (see <a
href="Hhwnews.htm">article</a> on page 1 of this newsletter). One
of these recommendations is that the Division should encourage
private sector collection of certain household hazardous wastes.
Automotive fluids (such as oil and antifreeze) are one category
of HHW for which private collection and management of the wastes
are widely available. P<sup>2</sup>AD is currently forming an
Automotive Fluids Work Group to take a closer look at this
particular area of concern. The work group will be composed of
representatives from environmental organizations, trade
associations, recyclers of automotive products, and government.
This work group will serve for a limited period of time and will
provide the Division with specific recommendations for prevention
and management of auto-related wastes. If you have input for this
work group to consider, or you would like more information about
the work group, please contact Bill Wells of my staff at (404)
651-5120 or 800-685-2443.</p>

<h2 align="center">How Clean is Clean?</h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by Paul Crumpler, Pollution Prevention
Engineer</strong></p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>Frying pans, cars, the Empire State Building, surgical
instruments, machined aluminum light poles, and Rottweilers all
have two things in common. All get dirty and somebody wants to
clean them, whether they need it or not. The keys to cleaning are
knowing the nature of the item to be cleaned, the nature of the
soil to be removed, the number of items to be cleaned, and what
will be done with the item after it is cleaned. When these items
are known, an appropriate cleaning method can be chosen.
Sometimes the choice is not to clean, as in the case of the
Rottweiler. Some essential items to remember are that a perfectly
clean part will cost more to produce, cost more to maintain
cleanliness, generate more waste during cleaning, and often
functions no better (and sometimes worse) than a part cleaned to
a less lofty standard. Perfectly clean is also perfectly
impossible to achieve. </p>
<h3>The Importance of Specs</h3>
<p>Specifications are often left to the imagination when
cleanliness is required. &quot;Oxygen clean,&quot; &quot;free of
oil and grease,&quot; and &quot;remove all chips, oil, dirt,
etc.&quot; are typical notes placed on engineering drawings.
Besides being unmeasurable, they are often added by rote as part
of standard drawing notes. Pass / fail criteria are much better
ways of specifying cleanliness. For example, a critical area of
the part in question could be examined under magnification with a
ten by ten millimeter (mm) field broken into 100, one millimeter
squares. A maximum number of machining chips could be specified;
for example, the part will be acceptable if no more than three
machining chips are visible within the grid, with the largest
chip no larger than 0.5 mm in any direction. The presence of oil,
dust, or unidentified foreign material could also be specified in
a similar manner. Other pass/ fail tests could be devised of
varying sophistication; the importance of specifications is to
insure that the part is suitable for use. </p>
<p>Functional specifications can also be applied indirectly.
Cleanliness of painted parts can be specified in terms of paint
adhesion. If a specific level of adhesion is specified for the
part, the level of cleanliness of the part must be such that
paint adhesion will not suffer. A common paint adhesion test is
the scratch test. A painted surface is cut with a razor blade;
adhesive tape is placed over the scratch and then pulled off. The
amount of paint adhering to the tape is used as the pass / fail
criteria of the paint. But it is also a direct functional test of
the cleanliness of the part. Fingerprints, oils, or other
materials that could cause the paint to not adhere to the part
must be removed sufficiently prior to painting in order for the
coating to pass the test. It should be noted that manufacturers
have found that some items require no cleaning prior to painting.
Certain casting techniques, oil-free machining, and proper
selection of paint can allow parts to be used without any type of
cleaning prior to painting. An important aspect of no-clean
methods is prevention; if parts do not get dirty then they do not
need cleaning.</p>
<p>Cleaning is the removal of offending soils from an item
without destroying the item. Offending soils are any substances
that prevent the item from functioning as intended.
Unfortunately, there are many types of offending soils and
offended parts that need to be cleaned. The most common cleaning
application is cleaning prior to painting; this generally
consists of removing oils, greases, waxes, silicon, and mill
scale from metal surfaces to improve paint adhesion and
appearance. Maintenance cleaning jobs are also very common;
maintenance cleaning is typically removal of process materials to
prevent cross contamination of products, allow inspection and
replacement of worn parts, or removal of a buildup of materials
that may interfere with the function of the equipment. Regardless
of the reason for cleaning, common methods are usually some
combination of mechanical, aqueous, or solvent cleaning methods.
When selecting a cleaning method, chose a method that will
generate minimal waste. The amount of waste generated by the
cleaning process is a critical consideration. This is compounded
if either the cleaning media or the materials cleaned contain
hazardous materials. </p>
<h3>Blast Cleaning</h3>
<p>Old paint is often removed from machinery using sand blasting.
If the old paint contains lead, then it is likely that the spent
sand will be considered a hazardous waste. Sand blasting
generates very large volumes of spent sand; disposal costs of
hazardous waste from sand blasting can very high. A blasting
media that often generates less waste is steel shot. Steel shot
can be collected and reused many times for blasting; sand can be
reused very few times due to fracturing of the sand as it strikes
a surface. Even though steel shot and steel shot blasting
equipment is considerably more expensive when compared to sand,
steel shot blasting is much more economical for removal of
potentially hazardous coatings. In addition to sand and shot
blasting, there are many other types of abrasives and blasting
systems available ranging from air knives to carbon dioxide. Each
system is useful for a particular situation.</p>
<h3>Aqueous Cleaning Methods</h3>
<p>Another common cleaning method is aqueous cleaning. Water is
the primary ingredient in aqueous cleaning systems enhanced by
various detergents, acids, bases, heat, agitation, and abrasives.
Aqueous cleaning can be used on almost any type of material from
electronics to precision bearing assemblies. Instead of causing
corrosion, rust inhibitors can be applied to metallic parts while
cleaning in water-based solutions. Metal parts are often
degreased and pretreated prior to painting using spray wash
aqueous systems. Spray wash systems range from small,
self-contained cabinet systems, such as a common dishwasher, for
single part or batch cleaning, to large continuous processing
systems with numerous washing, rinsing, and drying stages.
Aqueous dip tanks are sometimes used to clean parts; dip tanks
are often enhanced using ultrasonic vibrations to improve the
solvency of the water and detergent. Dip tanks are also commonly
used for hand cleaning of parts using any combination of brushes,
rags, and scrapers. Vibratory and tumble cleaners use abrasive
media to remove burrs and radius corners of metal parts while
cleaning. Ceramic, metallic, and plastic abrasives of various
sizes and properties can be added to vibratory and tumble
cleaners. Rock polishers used by hobbyists are examples of tumble
cleaning. Water is not free and water treatment can be extremely
expensive. Detergents, phosphates, oils, and metals are
introduced into wastewater and rinse water from aqueous cleaning
systems. These chemicals are regulated as preset discharge limits
by the EPA and local publicly owned wastewater treatment systems.
Fines and surcharges will be imposed if the discharge limits
cannot be met. When considering an aqueous system, minimize water
use and contamination. Discuss plans with the administrator of
the local POTW (Publicly Owned Treatment Works). Choose cleaning
chemicals carefully. Many companies have installed expensive
aqueous cleaning systems to avoid the use of solvents only to
find that wastewater problems are equally as severe. Semi-aqueous
Cleaning Solvents are sometimes added to water to improve
cleaning or reduce cost in semi-aqueous cleaning. N-methyl
pyrrolidone (NMP) can be added to water or it can be used alone.
NMP is often reduced with water for cleaning jobs that do not
require the full strength solvent; cost can be reduced in this
manner. Depending on the particular solvent used, semi-aqueous
cleaning can be accomplished using the same methods as aqueous
cleaning. Flashpoint, air emissions, worker exposure, waste
treatment, and disposal are considerations when choosing a
semi-aqueous method. </p>
<h3>Solvent Cleaning</h3>
<p>Solvents are used either in pure form or blends of several
solvents to remove coatings or degrease components prior to some
other processing step. Solvents became the preferred choice for
cleaning chemicals in many industries due to their effectiveness
as cleaning agents and fast drying time. Solvents are used in
hand wiping, dip tanks, spray washing, laundry dry cleaning, and
vapor degreasers. As in aqueous cleaning, cleaning can be
enhanced by agitation, ultrasonic vibration, and heat. MEK
(methyl ethyl ketone), toluene, xylene, Freons,
1,1,1-trichloroethane, and perchloroethylene are some
traditionally used cleaning solvents that are very good at
degreasing and have a wide range of solvency. They are also
either toxic or ozone depleting chemicals and heavily regulated.
For these reasons, many companies are seeking other methods of
cleaning such as aqueous or blasting methods. Often, less
hazardous solvents can be substituted; mineral spirits or NMP can
be substituted for MEK in some cleaning applications. Most
solvents are sources of air pollution; their use is often
restricted and regulated even when nontoxic or nonhazardous
solvents are used. Solvents that are very toxic, have a low
flashpoint, or are ozone depleting should be avoided. </p>
<p>Once solvents become too laden with soils to clean, they can
either be disposed of off-site or recovered by filtration or
distillation. Filtration techniques can remove solid and
dissimilar liquid contaminants, leaving the solvent suitable for
some extended reuse. Distillation units can be purchased to
remove almost all contamination; distilled solvents can often be
reused as virgin solvent either for product formulation or
cleaning. After their use has been minimized, distillation and
filtration are good ways to reduce disposal and operating cost. </p>
<h3>Where to Get More Information</h3>
<p>Table 1 lists some common cleaning methods and chemicals,
their uses, and waste generating potential. These methods and
others are described in a software package entitled SAGE or
Solvent Alternatives Guide. SAGE is an interactive computer
program designed to provide alternatives to solvent cleaning
after asking specific questions about the current cleaning
processes and materials. Options are ranked numerically according
to their potential for successfully fulfilling the specific
cleaning needs. Detailed descriptions of the cleaning
technologies will be provided by SAGE in addition to vendor
information. SAGE can be obtained via modem from the
Environmental Protection Agency's Technology Transfer Network
(TTN) bulletin board at (919) 541-5472 or through the Internet. P<sup>2</sup>AD
can also provide a diskette with the program upon request;
contact Jan Bunn at (404) 651-5120 or (800) 685-2443 in Georgia
to request a free diskette. More detailed information can be
obtained by attending the Solvent Alternatives Workshop on June
15, 1995 in Atlanta. The one-day workshop will be held on the
Georgia Tech campus, and will provided detailed descriptions of
many industrial cleaning methods. Workshop attendees will have a
good opportunity to ask the experts about their particular
cleaning needs. P<sup>2</sup>AD also has an e-mail address, send
questions, comments, or information requests to <a

<h2 align="center">NICE<sup>3</sup> Grants</h2>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>As many of you are aware, P<sup>2</sup>AD currently has two
grants from the Department of Energy's (DOE) National Industrial
Competitiveness through Energy, Environment, and Economics (NICE<sup>3</sup>)
program. One of these projects is investigating the automated
reuse of dyebaths in carpet manufacturing. Shaw Industries in
Dalton will be the demonstration site for this grant. Our other
current project is developing an advanced mineral calcining
process, which will improve lime recovery in the pulp and paper
industry. The next phase of this project will be a
commercial-scale demonstration at the Weyerhaeuser Corporation
plant in Oglethorpe.</p>
<p>The Division's past success in the NICE<sup>3</sup> program
can be attributed in part to our thorough and lengthy review of
all proposals submitted for funding. Additionally, our past
experiences have taught us that a period of several months will
be necessary to produce the final proposal documents for
submission to DOE. Therefore, we strongly recommend that anyone
who wishes to apply for the NICE<sup>3</sup> 1996 program submit
an abstract for P<sup>2</sup>AD's consideration on or before
August 2, 1995. This will enable us to have sufficient time to
work with the projects prior to DOE's two-page abstract deadline
of October 2, 1995. Note that this does not preclude applicants
from working with other eligible state agencies in submitting a
proposal past this recommended deadline ; the August 2 date
applies only if you are seeking to submit an application through
P<sup>2</sup>AD. See the description below for more details.</p>
<h3>NICE<sup>3</sup> Grant Solicitation</h3>
<p>The Georgia Pollution Prevention Assistance Division is
pleased to solicit abstracts from parties with innovative
pollution prevention projects who are interested in applying for
the 1996 round of NICE<sup>3</sup> grants from the Department of
Energy. The timeline for the 1996 Solicitation is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>August 2, 1995 - Recommended submission date for project
        abstract to P<sup>2</sup>AD </li>
    <li>October 2, 1995 - Deadline for submission of two-page
        abstract to DOE</li>
    <li>January 16, 1996 - Deadline for application package
        submission to DOE</li>
    <li>April 22, 1996 - Awards announcement </li>
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Reducing Waste from Solvent Sink Parts Washers</h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by Paul Crumpler, Pollution Prevention
Engineer </strong></p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>So you have 14 solvent sink parts washers. They clean well,
but waste management is a problem. The sink company replaces the
solvent every four weeks and now you just found out that you are
a hazardous waste Large Quantity Generator. What can you do?
Fortunately, there are several steps that can be taken to reduce
waste and save money. </p>
<p>How dirty is the solvent in the sink? If the solvent is still
cleaning your parts well, do not change the solvent. There is no
rule that says solvent must be changed out every four weeks. Only
replace the solvent when it no longer cleans. Run some tests and
see how long the solvent will last. Some sinks may be used more
than others. Periodically moving sinks from light to heavy wash
loading areas will extend the solvent life by sharing the
cleaning load between all sinks. </p>
<p>Is there a filter on the solvent sink? Many newer solvent
sinks will filter solids from the solvent as the pump
recirculates the solvent. Instead of replacing the solvent, some
companies have found that only the filter needs to be replaced to
keep the solvent sink working. If the solvent sink is leased, the
supply company can often replace existing sinks with filter type
sinks. If your company owns the sinks, consider purchasing new
sinks with filters or refitting the sinks with filters.</p>
<p>Use the solvent sinks in stages. If solvent sinks are used in
pairs, the solvent will last longer. One sink is the first stage
washer; very dirty parts are washed here. The second sink is the
final washer. The solvent in the first stage will become very
dirty, but even dirty solvent will remove heavy grease and grime.
The final wash sink will stay clean; the clean solvent will
remove any grime left on the part after it has passed through the
first stage. When the solvent in the final washer gets too dirty
for final cleaning, it can be replaced with clean solvent. The
dirty solvent removed from the final washer is used to replace
the solvent in the first stage sink. Only the very dirty solvent
from the first stage sink is shipped offsite as waste. This type
of cleaning is called two-stage washing; this process can reduce
solvent usage and waste generation significantly. </p>
<p>Finally, why use solvent? There are a number of cleaning
solutions that can replace solvents such as mineral spirits. Many
of these chemicals are not hazardous. Using nonhazardous
solutions may be your solution to reducing hazardous waste,
providing a safer workplace, and saving money.</p>

<h2 align="center">GEORGIA'S 1993 TRI DATA</h2>
<h3 align="center">GEORGIA MANUFACTURERS PASS THE 50% MARK IN
TOXIC CHEMICAL RELEASE REDUCTION </h3>
<p align="center"><strong>by Bill Vondersmith, Pollution
Prevention Engineer</strong></p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>Annual Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) reporting is required
under section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community
Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) of 1986. EPCRA requires manufacturers
in Standard Industrial Classifications 20 through 39 with 10 or
more employees that manufacture, process, or use a listed toxic
chemical above specific threshold quantities to report multimedia
releases and off-site transfers to the state and EPA.</p>
<p>The 674 Georgia manufacturers submitting TRI reports for 1993
represent an increase of five percent over the 1992 reporting
while realizing an eleven percent decrease in emissions. Part of
the decrease can be attributed to the 947 source reduction
activities instituted by one-third of the manufacturers. The
majority of the activities reported dealt with operation and
maintenance, process modifications, and spill prevention (see
Figure 1).</p>
<p>&gt;From 1988 to 1993 Georgia companies have achieved an
overall reduction in TRI total releases of 55.6 percent (see
Figure 2). The total releases shown in Figure 2 are made up of
categories which include fugitive and stack air emissions, waste
water discharges, land disposal, waste water discharges to
Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW), and waste transferred off
site for disposal or recycling (see Figure 3). Releases in all of
the categories have decreased over the last four years with the
exception of land disposal which showed an increase. This
increase only represents six tenths of one percent of the 1993
total releases.</p>
<p>The largest reduction in actual pounds released occurred in
the stack air category where 1993 releases were 20.6 million
pounds less than the 1990 releases. Stack air currently
represents over fifty-five percent of the total annual releases.
Together stack and fugitive air emissions account for seventy
four-percent of the 1993 releases. Analysis of trends in the
release of some common solvents (such as benzene, methyl ethyl
ketone, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane) shows that solvent usage in
the state has declined. </p>
<p>Increased TRI reporting and total releases are anticipated
over the next two years due to the EPA adding 32 chemicals in
1994 and 286 in 1995 to the TRI list. These chemicals, while
previously regulated under other environmental laws, have not in
the past had their releases quantified. Expansion of the TRI
chemical list is expected to generate additional interest in
pollution prevention activities presenting new opportunities to
reduce pollutants entering the environment. Not only will this
reduce pollution, but in many cases companies will save money
implementing methods that reduce waste streams requiring costly
treatment and/or disposal.</p>
<p>The TRI data presented in this article was taken from
Georgia's Toxic Release Inventory Report, 1993 published by the
Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection
Division. Copies of this report may be obtained by calling (404)
656-6905.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b>Industrial Solid Waste Reduction Makes
$$$$$ and Sense</b> </h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by Susan Varlamoff, Outreach
Coordinator</strong></p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Fall 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>In just three years, McDonald's has implemented nearly 100
initiatives to reduce waste, recycle, and buy recycled products
in its 9,400 restaurants across the country. Together, these
initiatives have eliminated 7,500 tons of packaging annually,
saving the company $5 million dollars. Georgia-Pacific has worked
equally hard to get the most from every tree that comes into its
plant and mills. More than 200 waste minimization projects that
involve source reduction, improvements in processes and products,
and increased reuse, recovery, and recycling have resulted in $80
million in annualized savings.</p>
<p>While companies save on tipping fees by reducing and reusing
waste, recyclers are reaping near record high profits across the
country. According to a <i>New York Times</i> article on June 27,
1995, executives of garbage giant, Browning-Ferris Industries,
are cheering the good news as they bankroll increased revenues
for their stockholders by collecting and selling waste paper,
aluminum, glass, cardboard, and various other recyclables from
households and industry. (See inset for current market prices.)</p>
<p>However, before company managers empty their dumpsters
searching for materials to sell, it is more cost effective to
reduce or eliminate waste before recycling residuals. Any income
obtained from recycling cannot possibly offset the purchase price
of the original products. Typically, it costs 50 cents per pound
to buy steel while recycling revenues amount to only 2 cents a
pound. The most cost effective way to deal with solid waste is to
follow the waste management hierarchy:</p>
<pre>                          R E D U C E
                                
                           R E U S E
                                
			 R E C Y C L E</pre>
<p>During the first two years of P<sup>2</sup>AD's existence, the
technical staff has provided assistance to several hundred
companies ranging from a small auto body shop to Georgia-Pacific
Corp. On-site assessments have been done for a wide variety of
manufacturers. P<sup>2</sup>AD is currently focusing significant
resources in the following industry sectors: Pulp and Paper
Products, Chemical and Allied Products, Transportation Equipment,
Rubber and Plastic Products, Fabricated Metal Products, and
Printing and Publishing. </p>
<p>One pollution problem that P<sup>2</sup>AD found in common for
every company in every sector was solid waste. In fact,
industrial solid waste comprises the majority (57%) of the solid
waste stream produced in the United States (see graphic below).
Some companies, like pulp and paper mills, spend over 1 million
dollars each year for the removal of solid waste. In most cases,
a considerable amount of the solid waste produced by a company
can be reduced, reused in its processes, or recycled. </p>
<p>Generally, industrial solid waste can be classified as either
process waste or packaging waste. Waste can be caused by anything
from uncontrollable process inefficiencies to design limitations,
low raw material quality, inefficient plant layout, poor
housekeeping, and maintenance or operational neglect. It is
important to evaluate the nature of the waste and make the
necessary changes to reduce it.</p>
<h3><b>Process Waste</b></h3>
<p>If there are significant amounts of product in the dumpster,
there may be a process problem. Evaluating processes and altering
them to minimize the amount of waste produced will most likely
save money in the long term. In-house reuse of process wastes is
becoming a more familiar practice. Some printing companies have
&quot;closed the loop&quot; by recycling all their waste products
back into their operations.</p>
<h3><b>Packaging Waste</b></h3>
<p>Packaging waste, one example of the &quot;low hanging
fruit&quot; of waste minimization, is the easiest area in which
to begin reduction. A good way to reduce packaging waste at a
facility is to work with suppliers. Encourage them to take back
whatever packaging they sent or redesign packaging to minimize
material used. Some materials are sold in returnable totes.
Another way to reduce packaging is to work with customers.
Reducing packaging and shipping wastes will reduce both
production and disposal costs. Finally, whatever cannot be
reduced or reused should be recycled if possible. It is important
to speak with brokers and end users to be sure their quality
requirements can be met for a specific material. The Georgia
Department of Community Affairs (404-656-3851) can provide you
with their 1994 Recycling Markets Directory for Georgia.</p>

<h3 align="left">Industrial Solid Waste by Industry Sector</h3>
<h4><b>Pulp and Paper Products</b></h4>
<p>Solid waste is probably the most significant waste from pulp
and paper manufacturers in terms of disposal cost and volume.
Often, wood chips become contaminated with dirt or sand when they
fall from conveyors, rendering them unusable to make paper or as
a fuel. Bark that falls from logs waiting to be processed
similarly cannot be used as a fuel if contaminated with sand and
dirt. Oversized and undersized logs and limbs that cannot be
processed by mill equipment are also landfilled. The Mill Residue
and By-products Consortium is an industry-wide effort to identify
reuse opportunities for mill waste. Members include
representatives of many of the southeastern pulp and paper mills.
Contact Dr. Larry Morris at (706) 542-8356 for more information.</p>
<h4><b>Chemical and Allied Products</b></h4>
<p>Chemical manufacturers normally receive chemicals in metal and
plastic drums. These drums can be recycled throughout Georgia. It
might be worthwhile to request vendors to take back empty drums
also. Packaging waste in this industry includes wooden pallets
and plastic wrap. Wooden pallets can be recycled or sent back and
plastic wrap should be minimized.</p>
<h4><b>Transportation Equipment</b></h4>
<p>Packaging waste in the form of wooden pallets and cardboard is
a significant solid waste in this sector, and it can be recycled.
Also, paint cans are abundant solid wastes in this industry. The
paint must be used completely or left to dry out. Then the steel
can, in most cases, can be recycled. (In cases where great
amounts of paint are used, it is important to check with a
compliance officer at the Environmental Protection Division to
learn whether air drying is permitted.)</p>
<h4><b>Rubber and Plastic Products</b></h4>
<p>Those industries that produce liquid raw rubber for use in
manufacturing carpet backing and other rubber products generate
large quantities of sludge from wastewater treatment. The
technology exists to reclaim the rubber for reuse, but an
economically feasible system has not yet been developed to
perform this function. </p>
<p>More than 120 companies now reclaim and recycle used plastics
in Georgia. It is important to sort according to type and avoid
contamination to obtain the best market price. </p>
<h4><b>Fabricated Metals</b></h4>
<p>Steel scrap comprises a great amount of the waste produced by
this industry. To reduce the waste, the steel can be ordered in
widths that match the parts produced. Scrap should be reused for
other projects when possible. When several metals are used in one
operation, scrap should be segregated by type and recycled. Metal
shavings are often contaminated with oil during processing. Chip
wringers can be purchased to wring out the oil for reuse and make
the metal saleable.</p>
<p>Packaging waste consists of pallets, crating, drums, and
cardboard - all of which can be returned or recycled. For
companies with substantial amounts of cardboard, a baler should
be considered because the price of baled cardboard is
substantially higher than unbaled.</p>
<h4><b>Printing and Publishing</b></h4>
<p>A medium size printing company can easily fill a 40 cubic yard
dumpster per day with process waste. Trim, start-up strips, end
strips, or non-conforming product generated by companies that
print newspapers, flyers, cereal boxes, and snack food bags are
common solid waste, much of which is sent to the landfill. It is
possible to recycle much of this material. It is also possible to
reduce much of this waste by altering processes.</p>
<p>As disposal costs increase, discarded waste from one industry
for reuse by another is becoming more common. For this reason,
waste exchanges have been set up around the country. A waste
exchange is a service which promotes the use of one company's
waste for another's raw material. It publishes lists of wanted
and available materials/wastes, amount and form of waste, and
general geographic location. Waste exchanges can result in
savings to the donor through reduced disposal costs, and to the
recipient through reduced raw material charges. The following
exchanges will handle material for companies located in the
Southeast:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Southeast Waste Exchange - Charlotte, NC (704) 547-2767</li>
    <li>Southern Waste Information Exchange - Tallahassee, FL
        1-800-441-7949</li>
    <li>National Materials Exchange Network - Spokane, WA (509)
        466-1532</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest challenge to reducing waste is the ability of a
company to sustain a commitment to a program. However, in the
long run, solid waste reduction in industry will save money,
improve efficiency, and preserve natural resources and landfill
space. It's obviously a win-win situation for both industry and
the environment and worth pursuing.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b>Stormwater and Pollution Prevention
Conference for Truckers</b></h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by Paul Crumpler</strong></p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Fall 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>The American Trucking Association (ATA) and the Georgia Motor
Trucking Association (GMTA) hosted a workshop on stormwater and
pollution prevention for trucking facilities. About 30 Georgia
truck maintenance facility operators learned about stormwater
pollution prevention best management practices and how to file a
mandatory Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan. Minimizing
process wastewater discharges and general pollution prevention
topics for trucking facilities were also discussed. Each person
attending the conference also received a video cassette entitled
&quot;Developing Stormwater Best Management Practices.&quot;</p>
<p>A stormwater permit and a formal Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan are required for most motor trucking facilities
by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD). William
Salter of EPD discussed how to obtain a permit. The date for
obtaining a stormwater permit has passed for existing facilities.
If a company has not yet obtained a permit, EPD should be
contacted now to begin the permitting process. Mr. Salter can be
reached at 404-656-4887. A major requirement for obtaining a
storm water permit is to create a Stormwater Pollution Prevention
Plan or SWP3. SWP3s use best management practices for materials
and facilities to prevent stormwater from becoming contaminated.</p>
<p>Steve Hensly of the ATA and Michael Stieferman of Radian
Corporation presented discussions of advanced best management
practices or BMPs to reduce stormwater contamination. Stormwater
can become contaminated when rain mixes with oil, fuel, grease,
antifreeze, metals, and many other truck-related chemicals. BMPs
are developed to reduce the chance that stormwater will become
contaminated. The key is prevention. If oil and other truck
fluids are not spilled and they are stored away from rain, then
stormwater pollution is reduced. Storing oil containers indoors
is a BMP to reduce pollution. Another BMP is to build a cover
over fueling islands. Curbs can also be built around covered
fueling islands to prevent water from flowing through areas where
spills are likely. A critical BMP is to remove or cover storm
drains in areas where spills are likely. Most BMPs are very
simple. Placing catch pans under trucks leaking oil and not
sweeping oil absorbent into a storm drain are very simple
examples. Training employees to use these simple methods can
reduce pollution, save time, and save dollars.</p>
<p>BMPs can be developed for each location or process in a
facility. Fueling areas, maintenance areas, materials storage
rooms, and waste storage areas can all be sources of waste and
pollution. A team of employees should locate critical areas on a
map or plan of the trucking facility. Chemicals and other
materials stored or used should be listed; those that are exposed
to rain or water flow should be identified. Records should also
be reviewed to learn of past spills; inspections should be done
to learn of current leaks and spills. From this information, BMPs
can be developed that are unique for the facility. Worksheets and
instruction for developing BMPs and a Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan were provided to those attending the conference.</p>
<p>Paul Crumpler of P<sup>2</sup>AD provided a discussion of
process water pollution prevention practices. A number of
trucking facilities wash trucks or engine components. If washing
is done outside, the wash water eventually reaches a storm drain
or septic drain field. Water from truck washing is process
wastewater. Process wastewater should never be allowed to flow
into storm drains or septic drain fields. Process wastewater can
be minimized by using simple methods; attaching spring-loaded
hose nozzles to hoses used for truck washing will prevent the
hoses from being left running when not in use. High pressure
spray units can also be used to wash trucks; they use about half
as much water as a garden hose and provide better cleaning. Wash
water should be disposed of in a municipal sewer system. If a
facility is not connected to a sewer system, wash water can be
collected and recycled. Water recycling systems are becoming more
popular; facilities ranging from small self-serve carwashes to
large fleet operations have installed recycling systems. Contact
Paul Crumpler at 404-651-5120 or 800-685-2443 for more
information on water use minimization and recycling.</p>
<p>Karen Medlin of the ATA discussed pollution prevention for
trucking operations and the effects of BMPs on selling property.
Using good pollution prevention techniques and avoiding soil and
groundwater contamination by employing BMPs can help prevent
problems in selling property and obtaining financing on land
where trucking facilities are located. Pollution prevention can
reduce cost today by reducing waste and loss of raw materials.
Pollution prevention can also help maintain the value of
property. When property is sold, most purchasers or banks will
require a review of the land's previous uses, conduct site
inspections, and review environmental records of businesses
previously located on the property. The reviews will attempt to
find evidence of site contamination such as from spills, leaking
or hidden underground storage tanks, and septic systems misused
for process wastewater. </p>
<p>Ms. Medlin provides information on pollution prevention topics
for the trucking industry. She can be contacted at the American
Trucking Association at 703-838-1786. The video and information
package (including stormwater planning worksheets) can be ordered
from the ATA. Also, a limited number of videos are available by
contacting Jan Bunn at P<sup>2</sup>AD. The Georgia Motor
Trucking Association can also provide information on
environmental issues and other topics of interest to the trucking
industry. The GMTA can be contacted at 404-876-4313. We encourage
all trucking facilities to take advantage of these excellent
resources. </p>

<h2 align="center">Get Ready ... ISO 14000 is Just Around the
Corner</h2>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Summer 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>As the world economies have become more integrated, business
standards have continued to shift from a national to an
international focus. Regardless of the industry, there needs to
be a basis for the fair exchange of goods and services despite
the cultural, regulatory, and currency differences between
countries. The International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) has been a driving force behind this movement. You may have
noticed that ISO does not correspond with the organization's full
name. &quot;ISO&quot; is actually not an acronym, but derived
from the Greek word &quot;isos&quot;, meaning equal. ISO is a
global federation of standards organizations representing nearly
100 countries whose mission is to facilitate the exchange of
goods and services on a global level. ISO became the leader in
the arena of international standardization with the development
of the now familiar quality standards ISO 9000.</p>
<h3>Why international environmental management standards?</h3>
<p>There are many forces that have contributed to the movement
for common worldwide environmental management standards. Global
environmental problems, regulatory differences between nationals,
trade agreements, multi-national companies, and consumer demand
for environmental friendly products are just a few. Consumer
demand for environmentally friendly products in Europe and more
restrictive product laws in some European countries have in some
cases amounted to non-tariff trade barriers. U.S. participation
in the development of international standards will help to insure
that these European markets remain open to our exports. Depending
upon who's doing the estimating, the environmental regulatory
burden on the U.S. gross national product is anywhere from 3% to
8%. This places U.S. companies at a tremendous disadvantage when
competing against products from countries without such regulatory
burdens. This is fueling the current political trend towards
deregulation in the U.S. For industry, the adoption of
market-driven environmental management standards is an
opportunity to justify deregulation and level the international
playing field.</p>
<h3>Who is drafting the standards?</h3>
<p>ISO 14000 standards are being developed by the ISO Technical
Committee 207. There are 35 countries, including the United
States, who are members of this committee. The U.S. delegation is
being overseen by the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI). Representing the U.S. on the committees and work groups
are a host of professionals from industry, consulting,
government, and academia. The process of developing a standard
begins with each country formulating a national position. Next, a
working group creates a draft document. After approval at the
sub-committee level, a Committee Draft (CD) is circulated for
comment and then ballot. A Draft International Standard (DIS) is
then issued for final commenting. If you desire to know more
about the ISO process, contact ANSI at 212-642-4900.</p>
<h3>What are the standards?</h3>
<p>There are five primary standards in ISO 14000. Three of the
standards, Environmental Management Systems (EMS), Environmental
Auditing (EA), and Environmental Performance Evaluation (EPE),
are management related, and the Environmental Labeling and
Life-Cycle Assessment standards are product related. The EMS
Standard consists of specifications for policy, planning,
implementation, corrective action, and management review for an
environmental management program. The EA Standards are guidelines
for audit procedures and auditor qualifications. The EPE Standard
provides direction in the evaluation of systems and determination
of performance.</p>
<p>The Environmental Labeling Standard is intended to harmonize
legal and cultural differences between countries in product
labeling. Issues addressed are third party certification/seal
programs and manufacturer self-declarations. Exactly what
information is to be contained in ecolabels has been an area of
significant debate. As a result, this standard has not progressed
as far through the process. The Life-Cycle Assessment Standard
specifies the use of life-cycle tools in product evaluation to
improve environmental performance. A life-cycle assessment is a
study of the impact on the environment resulting from the
production and use of a product from the extraction of raw
materials to the final disposal of waste. Some concerns at issue
in the development of ISO 14000 include the cost of
implementation, non-recognition by regulating agencies,
application to under-developed countries, trade barriers, and
disclosure of audit information during certification. Committee
Drafts (CD) may be obtained from ANSI (212-642-4900) or ASTM
(215-299-5487). The Draft International Standards (DIS) that were
approved at the Oslo meeting in June should be available by
August.</p>

<h3>Will ISO 14000 affect me?</h3>
<p>How do I know if my company needs ISO 14000 certification? Ask
yourself these three questions: Does my facility export products?
Does it supply foreign companies operating in the U.S.? Does it
supply other manufacturers who in turn export products? If you
answer yes to any of these questions, chances are you will be
hearing a lot more about ISO 14000 in the future.</p>
<h3>What can be done now?</h3>
<p>Although there will not be any finalized standards until next
year, beginning to prepare now will give you a head start for ISO
certification. The first standards to be completed will be EMS
and environmental auditing. These standards are the furthest
along in the process and are the least likely to change.
Preparing for the EMS Standard can be done without extensive
effort, and may translate into immediate benefits. The EPE, LCA,
and labeling standards are further from reaching a finalized
form.</p>
<p>Most heavily regulated industries in the U.S. should be well
prepared for the EMS Standard. The EMS Standard can be viewed as
a blueprint for an environmental management program or as a means
of bench marking an established program. To achieve EMS
certification you will need to have an environmental policy,
identify environmental aspects related to the operation, show
regulatory compliance, have objectives and targets that address
all environmental aspects in a manner consistent with the
environmental policy, define responsibilities, and provide
appropriate training. Procedures need to be established for
maintaining communication, documenting activities, maintaining
operational control, monitoring and measuring key aspects and
activities, taking corrective and preventive action, and
maintaining records. Finally, the system must be audited
periodically with managerial review of the system to ensure
continual improvement.</p>
<p>From a marketing standpoint, benefits associated with an
effective EMS include meeting the customer's environmental
expectations and certification criteria, enhanced image and
product recognition, and access to more markets. In the
manufacturing operations, an EMS will provide better cost
control, more efficient management of resources, and reduce
potential liabilities. Liability limitation will also lower
insurance costs. An EMS can improve access to capital by
demonstrating due diligence and satisfying investor criteria.
Externally, an EMS can improve industry-government relations,
expedite permitting processes, and help maintain good public
relations.</p>

<h2 align="center">Partner Approach to Resource Management</h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by Tony Knick, Department Manager,
Synthetic Industries, Inc.</strong></p>
<p align="center">[Summer 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>Synthetic Industries (SI) is taking resource management
seriously. Our company is making a commitment to be an
environmentally responsible manufacturing firm by managing our
resources for maximum efficiency and minimum waste. Recently, we
have taken yet another step towards protecting the environment.
Working in a partnership with the Georgia Pollution Prevention
Assistance Division (P2AD), SI formed a program called
S.I.E.R.R.A., which stands for Synthetic Industries Environmental
Resource Reduction Action. The S.I.E.R.R.A. program will carry on
the past recycling and waste minimization efforts at SI, and
contribute to the continuous improvement efforts of the Synthetic
Quality Mission (SQM).</p>
<p>The Chickamauga facility, which was recently ISO 9002
certified, has been selected as the pilot location for the
S.I.E.R.R.A. program. As part of S.I.E.R.R.A., eight employee
teams have been formed to focus on reducing and reusing materials
ranging from office paper and cardboard to lubricants and
packaging products. The teams collectively utilize the talents of
personnel from operations, maintenance, management, engineering,
accounting, and purchasing. Over forty employees are actively
participating in the program. Our corporate plan is to build the
S.I.E.R.R.A. program at Chickamauga, and then implement it at all
SI locations.</p>
<p>A primary goal of the program is to reduce the amount of solid
waste sent to the local landfill 50% by 1996. During the course
of 1994, solid waste contributions to the landfill have been
reduced by 22% over the previous year. This reduction was
achieved through activities such as collecting and chopping bale
wire, enabling 633,720 lbs. of metal that was previously
unrecovered to be recycled. With the aid of outside recycling
partners, we are helping turn more than 10 million pounds of
polypropylene waste each year into such useful items as picnic
tables, benches, automotive parts, plastic lumber, plastic
pallets and, appropriately enough trash cans. In addition to
recycling efforts, SI continually seeks to use the most
environmentally friendly items available, including the use of
aluminum tubes instead of paper tubes in several different
applications. The aluminum tubes have a longer service life and
are easily recycled at the end of their useful life.</p>
<p>While the paper/plastics, wood, cardboard, and metals teams
are continuing to seek opportunities to reduce solid waste, the
process water and gas/air teams are working to conserve water and
energy resources. The vendor service team is exploring
cooperative waste minimization opportunities with suppliers and
customers. The approach taken by the teams is to identify wastes,
determine quantities and costs of the wastes, investigate
alternatives that reduce the waste, and use financial analysis to
chose the best solution. At SI, the more we examine our daily
processes, the more ways we find to reduce waste!</p>

<p>In the last issue, we asked how you reduced or eliminated
cleaning prior to painting. The following is a list of
suggestions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Improve housekeeping. Keep paint area free of
        contamination. Avoid handling of parts by employees prior
        to painting. </li>
    <li>Determine if cleaning is necessary. In some cases, the
        substrate is clean enough to paint without additional
        cleaning. </li>
    <li>Avoid using materials with protective coatings that must
        be removed prior to painting, such as preservatives used
        to protect products while in storage (i.e., oils, grease,
        and silicone). Vendors often ship materials with
        protective coatings. Work with these vendors to reduce
        the use of such coatings. In some instances, materials
        that require painting can be replaced with color-matched
        injection molding.</li>

<p>In the last issue, we asked how you replaced 1,1, 1-
trichloroethane in your cleaning operations. The following is a
list of the responses that we received.</p>
<ul>
    <li>One company kept the contamination out of their process
        by improving their housekeeping, thereby eliminating the
        need to clean. </li>
    <li>Southwire Machinery Division (SMD) in Carrollton replaced
        1,1,1 with an alkaline cleaner that is applied using a
        heated pressure washer system. </li>
    <li>Additional replacements include terpene blends and
        water-based cleaning systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is not one drop-in replacement that will work for every
cleaning operation. Disadvantages associated with using an
alkaline solution as well as the other alternatives may exist .
For more information about solvent substitution or how to choose
the best replacement, contact P2AD's Information Manager, Jancie
Hatcher at (404) 651-5120 or 800-685-2443.</p>

<h2 align="center">Paint, Cleaners, and Batteries, Oh My!</h2>
<p align="center"><b>by Stephanie Siniard, Pollution Prevention
Specialist</b></p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Fall 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>How do I dispose of leftover paint? Can I put pesticides in my
trash? These are questions that P<sup>2</sup>AD will be grappling
with in the next couple of months as the Division develops a
household hazardous waste (HHW) program as part of our mission.</p>
<p>Presently, P<sup>2</sup>AD is proactively pursuing activities
focused on household hazardous waste management and prevention.
These activities include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The formation of a Household Hazardous Waste Work Group</li>
    <li>Conducting a statewide HHW survey</li>
    <li>Developing educational material, including a series of
        brochures and handouts </li>
</ol>
<p>As first discussed in the Winter 1994/95 issue of From the
Source, the Division created the HHW Work Group in January of
this year. The mission of this work group was to provide the
Director of P<sup>2</sup>AD with recommendations on the
feasibility of a state-sponsored program which would reduce
household hazardous waste generation in Georgia. The workgroup
was comprised of 15 citizens representing government, trade
associations, retailers, and environmental groups.</p>
<p>The workgroup developed recommendations which were available
for public comment until August 7, 1995. The highlights of the <a
href="Hhw.htm">Final Report</a> (September 22, 1995) include the
following five recommendations in no particular order:</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should serve as the lead state agency for HHW
prevention and management. P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop
guidelines for conducting HHW prevention and management programs.
P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote pollution prevention of HHW
through various public education programs, such as incorporating
HHW educational materials into existing school curricula. P<sup>2</sup>AD
should (as funds are available) fund several pilot household
hazardous waste collection programs in the state. These projects
would hopefully provide information to the state regarding the
feasibility of various types of collection events. P<sup>2</sup>AD
should create and/or promote collection for certain HHW items.
(Recommendations made by the workgroup are non-binding.)</p>
<p>The second activity focused on household hazardous waste is a
statewide survey. P<sup>2</sup>AD and the Georgia Environmental
Protection Division (EPD) are working with Georgia State
University's Applied Research Center to develop the survey. The
purpose of the survey is to 1) determine the public's perception
and level of knowledge about household hazardous waste and 2)
gain a better understanding of current disposal practices and
homeowners' interest in a community household hazardous waste
program in Georgia. The survey will also serve as an evaluation
tool to design a program and act as a baseline to measure the
projects' success. The results of this survey should be available
by late December.</p>
<p>Finally, P<sup>2</sup>AD is in the process of developing a
series of technical and educational material, including brochures
for local governments and the general public. Since the mission
of P<sup>2</sup>AD focuses on pollution prevention, materials
will follow the waste management hierarchy of prevention, reuse,
recycle, and proper disposal or treatment, and will focus on
eliminating improper disposal of household hazardous waste.</p>
<hr>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD's Information Center contains numerous
articles on household hazardous waste including educational
materials, brochures, case studies, and publicity paraphernalia.
To learn more about household hazardous waste or for a complete
list of the resources available on the subject, contact Stephanie
Siniard at (404) 651-5120 or 800-685-2443.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b>What Can P</b><sup><b>2</b></sup><b>AD's
Information Center Do For Me?</b></h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by Jancie Hatcher, Information Manager</strong></p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Fall 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the common questions asked of P<sup>2</sup>AD's staff
is &quot;What services can you provide to me and my
business?&quot;. This article is the first in a series which will
answer that question. The focus of this issue's article is on the
Information Center (Center).</p>
<p>The Center strives to be your one-stop source in Georgia for
pollution prevention and source reduction information. One phone
call (404-651-5120 in the Atlanta calling area or 1-800-685-2443
from outside the metro area) will connect you to the Center.
Jancie Hatcher or another staff member will talk with you and get
an understanding for the type of pollution prevention information
you and your business need and want. In addition to providing the
types of information described below, the staff may also refer
you to one of P<sup>2</sup>AD's engineers for consultation or
on-site assistance. If you have Internet access, the Information
Center can be reached through e-mail at: <a
href="mailto:p2ad@ix.netcom.com"><i>p2ad@ix.netcom.com</i>.</a></p>
<p>After you have initially contacted P<sup>2</sup>AD, a wide
variety of resources from the Center are available to you. The
Center includes a library with over 2300 documents, journal
articles, and books pertaining to pollution prevention,
recycling, and household hazardous waste. All documents have been
abstracted and catalogued in a database to allow easy searching
for specific topics. The staff can provide you with a
bibliography of library holdings for your area of interest.
Single copies of most materials or referrals to other sources of
documents (such as EPA's Pollution Prevention Information
Clearinghouse) are also available free of charge. Although
materials do not circulate as in a traditional library, all
materials are available for public access and use during normal
business hours.</p>
<p>In addition to books and reports, the Center also maintains
over 40 current periodical subscriptions. Journals which contain
general environmental topics include Environment Today,
Environmental Solutions, and EPA Environmental Policy Alert.
Topical journals include Industrial Paint &amp; Powder, Pulp
&amp; Paper, and Precision Cleaning, and publications of regional
interest include Georgia Environmental News, Georgia
Environmental Law Letter, and the Atlanta Business Chronicle.
Pertinent pollution prevention articles from these journals are
also listed in the library's database for quick access.</p>
<p>A third part of the Center's collection consists of over 50
videos. There are videos available on such topics as parts
cleaning, solvent alternatives, corporate pollution prevention
programs, and vehicle maintenance. A public viewing area at P<sup>2</sup>AD's
offices is open during normal business hours.</p>
<p>In addition to its in-house resources, the Center also has
access to a wide variety of outside knowledge. The staff
routinely accesses the holdings at the Georgia Tech and Georgia
State University libraries. P<sup>2</sup>AD also uses the
services of the Waste Reduction Resource Center (WRRC), a
regional source for pollution prevention information funded by
EPA and the Tennessee Valley Authority. P<sup>2</sup>AD keeps a
current listing of WRRC's library holdings on computer for easy
identification of pertinent documents they may have that the
Center does not. P<sup>2</sup>AD's staff also use the Internet
(World Wide Web, gopher sites, etc.) to research specific client
needs.</p>
<p>Clearly, the P<sup>2</sup>AD Information Center has a lot of
reference material that could be useful in integrating pollution
prevention into YOUR business! The staff works hard at answering
your pollution prevention questions in a timely manner. We invite
you to try out the Information Center for yourself, and we look
forward to serving you.</p>

<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Fall 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>Environmental management costs have become a significant
portion of the total operating budget for many companies. In
order to remain competitive, companies must find cost-effective
ways to identify and resolve environmental issues affecting their
operations. There is a new weapon available to help companies in
the fight to control these costs.</p>
<p>The Southeastern Environmental Resources Alliance (SERA) is a
non-profit organization created to provide information, technical
assistance, and implementation services to small and medium-sized
companies. SERA was established as a joint effort by the U.S.
Department of Energy, Westinghouse Savannah River Company, and
the states of South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>SERA clients in Georgia will have access to the technical
assistance services available through several existing
organizations. Georgia Tech's Economic Development Institute
(EDI) will provide on-site assessments focusing on energy
efficiency, environmental compliance, and basic pollution
prevention issues. P<sup>2</sup>AD will provide assistance to
SERA clients to resolve complex pollution prevention problems.
The University of Georgia's Department of Biological and
Agricultural Engineering will serve as the primary provider of
technical assistance to small and medium-sized companies in the
areas of pulp and paper, textiles, and food processing.</p>
<p>In addition to providing on-site technical assistance, SERA
will participate in industrial trade shows and conduct industry
specific workshops. Through these events, SERA will seek to bring
the latest information on cost-saving waste management measures
to companies throughout Georgia. SERA will also serve as a
mechanism for transferring advanced environmental and waste
management technologies developed at the Savannah River Site to
industrial facilities in Georgia and South Carolina.</p>
<p>The goal of SERA is to use technical assistance and technology
transfer to improve the competitive position of companies that
otherwise would not have access to such services. For more
information on the resources available through SERA, please
contact Ms. Jancie Hatcher, P<sup>2</sup>AD information manager,
at (404) 651-5120 or 800-685-2443.</p>

<h2 align="center">P<sup>2</sup>AD to Recognize Industry P<sup>2</sup>
Leaders</h2>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Summer 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>An advisory working group has recommended that P<sup>2</sup>AD
establish a program that recognizes and rewards companies that
excel at pollution prevention. The Recognition Criteria Work
Group was created by P<sup>2</sup>AD Director G. Robert Kerr to
recommend guidelines for a state-sponsored pollution prevention
recognition program. </p>
<p>The work group recommended the formation of two categories of
recognition: a certification program and the Governor's Award.
The certification program would be a non-competitive,
multi-tiered program that recognizes continuous performance and
improvement. The three levels in order of increased achievement
would be: entry, achievement, and model. The Governor's Award
program would recognize outstanding pollution prevention projects
by a company, individual, organization, academia, or a government
agency. Unlike the certification program, the Governor's Award
would be competitive. A company's environmental compliance
history would be considered in each recognition category.</p>
<p>The work group recommended that companies that achieve
certification should be publicly recognized. Companies that reach
the achievement or model level should be eligible for some type
of regulatory relief and/or financial incentives in the form of
reduced fees, expedited permitting, or reduced reporting or
inspections. The principal award in the Governor's Award program
should be primarily public recognition.</p>
<p>&quot;The underlying objective of the program should be to
encourage pollution prevention in Georgia industries by
recognizing companies that are good at it,&quot; said Work Group
Chairman Lee Thomas of Georgia Pacific.</p>
<p>&quot;The staff of P<sup>2</sup>AD will now use the
recommendations and continue to work with the public to develop
the recognition program,&quot; said P<sup>2</sup>AD Director Bob
Kerr.</p>
<p>The work group was made up of 14 citizens representing a cross
section of industry, government, and environmental groups. The
work group members are Lee Thomas, chairman; Peter Bonacum, Roy
Bowen, Elizabeth Brock, Rep. Denny Dobbs, Laurie Fowler, Carol
Foley, Win Hill, Pete Howard, Bruce Miller, Steve O'Day, Wesley
Wolff, Bob Woodall, and David Word.</p>

<h2 align="center">P2AD, Pollution Prevention, and the Internet</h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by Mike Garruto, P.E., Pollution
Prevention Engineer</strong></p>
<p align="center">[Summer 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>P2AD has found the Internet to be an extremely useful and cost
effective work tool, particularly the electronic mail (e-mail)
and World Wide Web (WWW) features. As most of you may not use the
Internet yet, I will provide some reasons why you may want to
explore it. There is a wealth of information available, including
resources on the topics of pollution prevention and waste
minimization. Unlike the past, using the Internet is now a simple
process with user friendly software and typical monthly
connection charges of $15 to $30. Of course, a fairly up-to-date
computer and modem are also requirements while local phone call
access to the Internet service provider helps keep costs down.</p>
<p>An Internet account will quickly pay for itself if you use the
e-mail feature to eliminate many overnight carrier charges and to
reduce long distance phone bills due to reduced fax machine use.
Text, spreadsheets, CAD drawings, graphics, and sound files can
be sent locally, nationwide, or around the globe to one person or
several almost instantaneously using Internet e-mail. </p>
<p>Please note that P2AD's e-mail address is <a
href="mailto:p2ad@ix.netcom.com">p2ad@ix.netcom.com</a>, and we
will be responsive to requests for information and services
through our e-mail in addition to the more traditional phone
contacts and personal meetings. One benefit of e-mail has been
the ability to increase our knowledge base by taking part in an
electronic mailing list comprised of P2 technical assistance
programs throughout the country. When confronted with a
challenging situation, P2AD's technical staff can pose questions
to experts throughout the country who may be aware of possible
solutions or previous research in the area.</p>
<p>One feature that is driving the explosive growth in Internet
use is the World Wide Web. The WWW basically provides access to
multimedia files provided by other Web users. Information
accessed may be supplied by government agencies, educational
institutions, private companies, not-for-profit groups, and
individuals. With the click of a mouse button, users can move
from one Web location to another throughout the world.</p>
<p>Recently P2AD, in conjunction with the Department of
Administrative Services, established a presence on the World Wide
Web at <bold>http://www.dnr.state.ga.us/P2AD/</bold>. It is our intent to
continually improve this online service to make it as useful as
possible to the public. Therefore, we welcome any and all
questions, comments, and suggestions.</p>
<p>Our Internet Web pages have several highlights. First, our
home page includes an introduction to P2AD. A home page typically
has graphics like the front cover of a book, an abstract about
the individual or organization, and a menu similar to a table of
contents. A second feature is the online availability of our
newsletter, &quot;From the Source.&quot; In addition, P2AD
provides the public with easy access to draft reports of work
group recommendations covering topics that affect how P2AD can
best serve its mission. Announcements for upcoming seminars,
society meetings, conventions, and training opportunities are
also accessible. Finally, P2AD is providing a page of
&quot;pointers,&quot; known as hypertext links, to other
pollution prevention and environmentally related servers. This
page can serve as an excellent starting point for research on a
variety of topics. To give you an idea of the type of information
available from these servers, I am providing a small sample of
worthwhile sites. If you already have Internet access, consider
using our home page as a timesaving means of linking to these
servers. If you have no idea what the Internet and World Wide Web
are all about, just talk to one of the millions of users to help
you get started. For those who have no interest in the Internet,
P2AD will still be able to utilize the Internet's resources to
help you by using it to communicate with experts and to research
specific topics related to your concerns. When you do visit our
web pages, please e-mail us with your suggestions or favorite
sites!</p>

<p><a name="Introduction "><strong>Introduction</strong> </a></p>
<p>The purpose of this report is to identify the specific causes
of waste generation, and cost-effective solutions that will
reduce waste in the pulp and paper industry in Georgia. The
benefits of reducing waste are reduced pollution and decreased
operating cost to the business. Releases of high-priority toxic
chemicals are the primary focus of this report but other
significant solid and liquid wastes will be included. Barriers
exist that limit the implementation of pollution prevention
projects and technologies. Barriers and strategies to overcome
them will also be discussed in this report. </p>
<p><a name="Methodology"><strong>Methodology</strong></a> </p>
<p>Review of trade and environmental publications indicated that
the processes responsible for Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)
releases in this sector are primarily Kraft pulping and bleaching
of pulp. Businesses that use these processes were identified by
reviewing 1993 TRI reports and the Georgia Manufacturing
Directory. There are relatively few pulp and paper mills in
Georgia. Telephone interviews were conducted of Kraft pulp mills
and paper mills in the state. Visits were made to six mills;
various processes related to Kraft pulping, bleaching, and
recycling were reviewed. The interviews and plant visits were
conducted to collect information on the various types of
equipment and chemistries used in the mills. Water usage, pulp
production, and information on various other wastes were
collected. Mill environmental and production staffs were also
questioned about programs at their facilities to reduce waste and
evaluate new technologies available to the pulp and paper
industry. The results of this study are presented in this
document. </p>
<p><a name="Summary"><strong>Summary</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The following key issues were identified as a result of this
study through contacts with Georgia pulp mill personnel, mill
tours, interviews with paper industry experts, and review of
various trade and environmental publications. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Lack of Facility Pollution Prevention Programs </li>
    <li>Water Use Reduction and Reuse </li>
    <li>Lime Mud Waste Reduction </li>
    <li>Energy Conservation and Recovery </li>
    <li>Alternatives to Chlorine Bleaching </li>
    <li>Log Yard Waste Reduction</li>
</ul>
<p>The Georgia Pollution Prevention Assistance Division (P<sup>2</sup>AD)
will assist Georgia pulp and paper manufacturers in addressing
these key issues by developing various programs. P<sup>2</sup>AD
will work with existing technical and business organizations to
provide training, publication of fact sheets and case studies,
and conduct applied research demonstration projects in order to
address critical pollution prevention issues. </p>

<h3><a name="Profile"><strong>Profile of the Pulp and Paper
Manufacturing Sector in Georgia</strong></a> </h3>
<p>Georgia pulp manufacturers produce pulp, bleached pulp, or
specialty pulp for the food and pharmaceutical industry. Many of
these companies also produce finished paper, paperboard, or
linerboard. Twenty-four companies are listed in the Georgia
Manufacturers Directory within SIC code 26 that are predominately
involved in cellulose pulp manufacturing. Approximately 13,000
people work for these manufacturers. A list of these businesses
is provided below in Table 1 with a description of the primary
products and number of employees. </p>

</table>
<p>Of the 24 manufacturers in Georgia, thirteen are large
manufacturers of pulp only, pulp and paper, or pulp and
linerboard. These manufacturers produce virgin pulp and form a
finished paper product. The pulp may be either bleached or
unbleached. Four Georgia mills produce bleached virgin pulp. Pulp
is also sold to paper manufacturers that make paper, filter
paper, or other specialty paper from pulp. There are
approximately 100 companies in Georgia that are primarily paper,
paperboard, or paper products manufacturers that do not
manufacture pulp. These companies are not the focus of this
study. </p>
<p>Another manufacturing group repulps old corrugated cardboard,
linerboard, newsprint, and other waste paper. There are at least
nine mills producing recycled pulp in Georgia. Recycling mills
manufacture pulp for sale to other industries or manufacture a
finished paper product. Some recycling mills deink printed stock
using floatation or continuous deinking. Bleaching is done
primarily with peroxide and less with sodium hypochlorite by
recyclers. At least one company recycles newsprint and other
paper in a dry repulping process to make insulation, animal
bedding, and reseeding material used on highway right of ways. </p>
<p>Paper mills need a source of water and a receiving body to
dispose of wastewater. Paper mills are generally located near a
river to provide a means of disposal for the often tremendous
wastewater stream generated by the mill. A secondary reason is to
provide water for mill usage since a number of mills use wells as
the primary source of mill supply water. Cooling water is also
needed and is usually supplied from surface water. All Georgia
mills have wastewater treatment plants except some of the small
specialty product mills, and dispose of wastewater directly to a
river after treatment. At least one mill disposes of wastewater
to a municipal treatment system. Several mills also purchase
water from a city or other source of treated water. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Processes"><strong>Pulp and Paper Industrial
Processes</strong></a><strong> </strong></h3>
<p>In order to understand the pulp and paper industry, a general
description of the pulping and paper making process is needed.
Each of the companies uses some or all of these processes. </p>
<p><strong>Wood Yard Operations</strong> </p>
<p>Wood is delivered to a pulp mill either as logs or chips. Logs
are delivered with the bark attached to prevent loss of moisture
and other degradation. Logs are handled in the yard by cranes or
log trucks. They are loaded onto a conveyor or log flume where
they are carried to a debarker and chipper. Chips are screened to
remove over and undersized chips, and then stored in the yard
awaiting digestion. The majority of the Georgia virgin pulp mills
have wood yards. A growing trend is to eliminate wood yards and
receive chipped wood only. Several mills receive only wood chips
or are planning wood yard closure in the near future. </p>
<p><strong>Water Treatment </strong></p>
<p>Pulp mills generally require a large amount of water in
processing to remove lignin and bleaching byproducts. Water is
generally obtained from rivers or wells. From 5,000 to 40,000
gallons of water is required to produce one ton of dry pulp in
Georgia's virgin pulp mills. This water is treated prior to use
to remove suspended solids and other contaminants. </p>
<p><strong>Digestion </strong></p>
<p>Chips are heated by steam and white liquor is added. The
liquor impregnated chips then enter the digester where they are
heated to cooking temperature. Spent cooking liquor or black
liquor is removed from the brownstock after cooking. In batch
digesters, the brownstock is blown from the bottom of the
digester vessel prior to washing. In a continuous digester,
washing takes place inside the digester to remove liquor and cool
the pulp. In either case, brownstock is washed to remove the
majority of spent liquor. It is also screened to remove
undigested knots. The majority of the 13 pulp mills use the Kraft
process. One mill uses the thermo-mechanical pulping process. </p>
<p><strong>Washing</strong> </p>
<p>Pulp washing takes place after each major process. The purpose
of washing is to remove undesirable elements from the pulp
stream. Black liquor, fines, lignin, and bleach byproducts are
removed after each processing step. Washer efficiency can be
measured by the cleanliness of the pulp and the amount of water
used to achieve that level of cleanliness. There are a number of
different types of washers available. Vacuum drum brownstock
washers (six-stage or three-stage) were the industry standards up
to the 1970s. At least six Georgia mills currently use vacuum
drum washers. Pressure brownstock washers represent a later
washing technology with at least one mill using this technology.
Diffusion brownstock washers are currently the industry
standards, but diffusion washers are also being improved upon.
Diffusion washers are used by at least three mills. At least two
pulp mills in Georgia use Chemi washers, which are the most
efficient washers available currently. Each improvement
represents cleaner pulp with a water usage reduction. </p>
<p><strong>Refining</strong> </p>
<p>Pulp passes through slots in rotating plates to separate the
cellulose clumps into fibers and condition the fibers for paper
making. Essentially, the fibers are cut to a uniform length
during refining which reduces strength. The fibers are also
conditioned by refining which improves bonding and strength of
the finished paper product. </p>
<p><strong>Oxygen Delignification</strong> </p>
<p>Some mills have installed an oxygen stage to further remove
lignin from the brownstock as a prebleaching step. Reduced lignin
content produces a whiter pulp. Oxygen and white liquor are added
to the brownstock in a heated reactor where additional
delignification takes place. Lignin compounds freed as a result
of oxygen delignification are removed in washing and extraction
stages. At least two Georgia mills use oxygen delignification.
Oxygen delignification reduces the amount of chlorine or other
bleaching chemicals required to whiten the pulp in the bleach
stage. </p>
<p><strong>Extended Delignification </strong></p>
<p>Various extended delignification techniques are used to remove
more lignin prior to bleaching. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and heat
act to break complex bonds in the lignin to make them soluble in
water or volatile. NaOH and heat also break bonds in the
cellulose reducing strength and yield. Extended delignification
techniques cook the wood chips at lower temperature for longer
periods of time to remove lignin with reduced damage to the
cellulose. Several techniques are in use to control temperature
and liquor chemistry in the digester. At least four mills in
Georgia use extended delignification. Extended delignification
reduces the amount of bleaching chemicals required in the
bleaching stage to produce the same pulp whiteness. </p>
<p><strong>Bleaching </strong></p>
<p>Bleaching usually takes place in a multistage process. The
purpose of bleaching is to remove lignin without damaging the
cellulose. One process is the DED process; D represents chlorine
dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>) and E represents extraction. In this
process, brownstock is mixed with ClO<sub>2</sub> in the D1
reactor which further reacts with lignin in the pulp. Washing
follows to remove the chlorinated lignin compounds from the pulp.
NaOH is added to the pulp stream in the E tower and is followed
by washing in a press. Extraction neutralizes the pulp and
improves subsequent washing. The D2 tower is the last stage of
bleaching where ClO<sub>2</sub> provides the final whitening of
the pulp. If preceded by oxygen delignification, the process is
abbreviated ODED. Chlorine (C), peroxide (P), oxygen (O), sodium
hypochlorite (H), and ozone (Z) are other chemicals that can be
used in various configurations. For example, ODEoD would consist
of: </p>
<p align="center"><em>oxygen reactor &gt; ClO</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em>
reactor &gt; extraction with oxygen added (EO) &gt; ClO</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em>
reactor</em> </p>
<p>The final stage of bleaching is often used to whiten or
lighten remaining lignin. Eight Georgia mills bleach pulp in some
manner, four of which are virgin pulp mills. </p>
<p><strong>Paper Making</strong> </p>
<p>The pulp is then transported to the paper machine where a pulp
mat is formed on a screen. Water is removed from the sheet by a
combination of vacuum, heat, and pressure applied through
rollers. The finished paper can be made in a variety of weights
and is rolled onto large rollers for shipment to other processing
plants. Paper is sometimes coated on the paper machine with
kaolin to provide a white surface or has a binder added to
increase wet strength. Some binders contain formaldehyde; many
companies have replaced these with nonformaldehyde binders. Other
coatings and binders contain ammonia or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA).
Approximately 17 mills in Georgia produce paper, paperboard, or
similar products. </p>
<p><strong>Power Boiler </strong></p>
<p>Energy in the form of heat and steam is generated by burning
waste wood from the log yard or fossil fuels. In addition to
steam, electricity is also often generated on-site at pulp mills.
Pulp and paper mills require a large amount of energy to operate. </p>
<p><strong>Liquor Recovery Cycle</strong> </p>
<p>NaOH and sodium sulfide (Na<sub>2</sub>S) are the primary
pulping chemicals. NaOH reacts with lignin in the wood to release
the cellulose fiber. Na<sub>2</sub>S buffers the reaction to keep
the solution caustic, and aids in the removal of digested lignin
by increasing its solubility. Spent cooking liquor, or black
liquor contains various organic and sulfur compounds in addition
to the reactive pulping components of NaOH and Na<sub>2</sub>S.
The black liquor is removed from the pulp at various locations
after the delignification process and concentrated in an
evaporator. The concentrated liquor, or strong black liquor is
combusted in a furnace along with sodium sulfate (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)
to recover Na<sub>2</sub>S, and sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>)
in the form of ash. This ash is mixed with water and lime (CaO).
The resultant reaction forms green liquor and replenishes the
original pulping chemicals NaOH and Na<sub>2</sub>S; calcium
carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>). CaCO<sub>3</sub> is precipitated
from the green liquor in a clarifier and converted back to CaO in
a lime kiln. After removal of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, the green liquor
becomes white liquor. The recovery cycle consists of a liquor
evaporator, recovery boiler, clarifier, and lime kiln. </p>
<p><strong>Wastewater Treatment</strong> </p>
<p>Wastewater gathered from various mill processes is treated
prior to discharge to reduce biological oxygen demand (BOD),
chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total suspended solids (TSS).
Wastewater typically passes through a primary clarifier to remove
the bulk of the cellulose fibers lost during processing and other
solids. Wastewater then passes through aeration ponds to further
reduce BOD and COD. Nutrients in the form of ammonium nitrate or
ammonia are often added to encourage microbe activity. Wastewater
is then discharged directly to a river or tidal river. Wastewater
volumes are very large ranging up to 40,000,000 gallons per day
with relatively low contaminant concentrations. In addition to
BOD, COD, and TSS, color and chlorinated compounds such as dioxin
have been of great concern to pulp mills. Aeration and
clarification do not significantly reduce color or chlorinated
compounds. </p>
<p><strong>Waste Paper Recycling</strong> </p>
<p>Another segment of the industry repulps cardboard or newsprint
into recycled paper or paperboard. Recycled material is repulped
by adding water, sodium hydroxide, and heat. The pulp is then
made into a finished paper product on a paper machine in the same
manner as a virgin paper mill. Deinking and bleaching are also
done at some recycle mills. Floatation is one common method of
deinking. Peroxide is commonly used in the bleaching process.
Approximately nine Georgia mills are involved in repulping waste
paper products. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Characteristics">Waste Stream and Generation
Characteristics of Georgia Pulp and Paper Manufacturers</a> </h3>
<p>Wastes are generated by the industrial processes used by
Georgia pulp and paper manufacturers. Almost all of the wastes
generated are derived from unusable portions of the tree such as
bark and lignin. Additional wastes are generated from power
generation or from the chemicals used in pulping, bleaching, and
chemical recovery. Energy is also a waste stream. Water entering
the mill is heated for process use. Thermal energy is emitted to
the environment from numerous sources. </p>
<p>The usable portion of a tree is cellulose from which paper is
made. Other materials such as turpentine are byproducts which
have a market value. Most other components are released to the
environment as solid waste, liquids, gasses, or energy derived
from combustion. </p>
<p><strong>Toxic Wastes</strong> </p>
<p>Toxic wastes reported on the 1993 TRI totaled more than 18.8
million pounds of which 16.4 million pounds were released to the
air. TRI releases for 1993 are shown in Figure 2. Of the 26
chemicals reported, methanol was released in the largest quantity
at approximately 9.3 million pounds. Methanol is generated from
pulping at the rate of 12 to 20 pounds per ton of production in
the Kraft process. Bleaching can increase that amount up to 25
pounds. Thermo-mechanical pulping also releases methanol, but in
much lower quantities at about 0.5 pounds per ton of pulp.
Methanol and other organics (MEK, acetone, etc.) are released
primarily from process vents, but are also found in wastewater
and the recovery furnace stack. Wastewater leaving the mill can
contain large amounts of the methanal; biological destruction of
methanol is estimated to be in excess of 99% in wastewater
treatment plants. Non-contact recovery boilers available since
the 1970s reduce methanol stack releases to near zero. Newer and
modernized facilities collect and combust process vent gasses in
the recovery boiler, lime kiln, or power boiler furnaces reducing
methanol and sulfur releases. Older facilities still have
uncontrolled process vents releasing significant amounts of
methanol. </p>
<p>Noncondensable gasses are usually burned in the lime kiln or
recovery boiler. Mills have traditionally avoided burning
noncondensable gasses in the recovery boiler due to an increased
risk of an explosion. Some mills have lime kilns which cannot
meet the capacity required to burn all noncondensable gasses, or
have significant downtime due to mechanical failures. The result
is increased emissions of sulfur and organics when the kilns are
used to combust noncondensable gasses. Burning noncondensable
gasses in the kiln also decreases the lime recovery capacity,
thus increasing solid waste in the form of disposed lime mud. A
few mills have begun to burn noncondensable gasses in recovery
furnaces to take advantage of their greater capacity. </p>
<p>Sulfuric and hydrochloric acids are also released by pulp
mills. These materials are combustion byproducts from coal-fired
boiler operations. Sulfuric acid is also used in paper making and
other mill processes to adjust pH. Zinc is another material
reported that is nonpulp related. Zinc is contained in ash from
burning tires as a boiler fuel. Tire burning for energy recovery
is a popular tire recycling or disposal method. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>FIGURE 2 - 1993 GEORGIA TRI RELEASES BY
PULP AND PAPER MANUFACTURERS IN POUNDS</strong></p>
<p align="center"><img src="pulp1.gif" width="447" height="280"></p>
<p>Chlorinated compounds such as chloroform are emitted from
wastewater and bleach plant process vents. Chloroform is
primarily associated with the use of sodium hypochlorite and
chlorine bleaching. Mills generally have replaced both of these
materials to some degree. Hypochlorite use is discontinuing.
Chlorine is being replaced either partially or fully by chlorine
dioxide. Ozone is also used in place of chlorine on a limited
basis in other states. For these reasons, chloroform emissions
have decreased. Dioxin is another chlorine related pollutant.
Dioxin levels in effluent from mills that have switched to 100%
chlorine dioxide are usually below detectable levels. Chlorine
dioxide has replaced chlorine completely, 100% substitution, in
three Georgia mills. Several other mills have replaced 20% to 30%
of the chlorine used for bleaching with chlorine dioxide. </p>
<p>Chromium and dichloromethane are two chemicals reported from
Georgia mills on the 1993 TRI. These are nonpulp related and are
due to specific situations that occurred at particular mills. </p>
<p><strong>Solid Waste</strong> </p>
<p>Solid waste generation by pulp and paper manufacturers varies
between 0.01 and 0.26 tons of waste per ton of product (TPT). The
wide diversity is due to several factors. Lime mud and wood yard
debris can be large solid waste streams. The sources of these
wastes are log handling and insufficient capacity lime kilns.
Some mills have sufficient lime kiln capacity and thus produce
small amounts of waste. Other mills have reduced wood yard waste
by purchasing wood chips and eliminating log storage. Other solid
wastes typical in pulp mills are wastewater treatment sludge and
digester knots. Sludge and knots are reused in some mills and
disposed of in others. </p>
<p>Solid waste is usually disposed of in on-site landfills; some
mills use municipal or private landfills. Disposal costs are
often very high, exceeding $2 million annually in some mills
whether on-site or off-site. Some municipal landfills used by
pulp mills have closed. As on-site landfills reach capacity,
several mills are considering building new landfills. New
landfills can cost $10 to $20 million to open and are not an
attractive option to most pulp mills. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Wood Yard Waste </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Wood yard waste generation by Georgia pulp and paper
manufacturers varies between 0.02 and 0.06 TPT. Oversized logs,
wood debris, decayed wood, sand, soil, and bark are typical
wastes. Wood waste can be burned in power boilers if soil and
sand are removed. Much of this material is landfilled, or used in
the landfill as cover material. Wood chips that are burned for
energy are still considered waste by most mills if originally
intended for pulping. Several mills indicated that wood yard
waste was the largest solid waste stream from their facilities. </p>
<p>Chip making also generates some wood waste. Knots and
undersized chips are removed from the chip screen. These
materials, along with bark, are usually used as fuel. Clean,
palm-sized bark chunks have a high market value as a landscaping
material. Some mills sell bark for landscaping. Sawmills and
other bark sources that traditionally sold this material to pulp
mills for fuel have diverted the landscaping suitable bark to
other markets. The smaller, dirtier bark is sold to mills for
fuel use. Soil and other debris in this bark must be removed
prior to burning or after as increased ash volume, thus creating
additional waste. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sludge </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Various mill sludges are also disposed of as solid waste but
are derived from wastewater treatment systems. Primary and
secondary clarifier sludges consist of dirt, debris, and
cellulose. This material is intentionally rejected due to being
out of specification or accidentally due to inherent
inefficiencies in the pulp washing systems. At each washing or
refining stage, some usable pulp is lost even after passing
though save-alls. Deinking sludges are generated from recycling
plants and consist of inks, clays, soils, and some cellulose
fiber. Mills sometimes dry and burn the sludges for energy
recovery and volume reduction. Deinking sludge will have
approximately 50% of the energy value of bark. Sludges are
sometimes applied to forest or farm land partially as a disposal
method and partially to recover nutrients. Sludge generation is
reported to be 0.02 to 0.06 TPT. Some pulp mills indicated that
improvements have been made in reducing the amount of cellulose
inadvertently sent to wastewater treatment. As the cellulose
content in sludge is reduced, sludge volume decreases. The sludge
generated is then less useful for traditional recycling options
such as reuse in ceiling tile manufacture or as fuel. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ash</strong><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>Ash is generated due to combustion. Coal, bark, wood, tires,
and sludge are burned producing varying amounts of ash due in
part to the amount of noncombustibles in the materials. Ash is
disposed of in landfills or has some limited reuse. Wood and bark
ash are sometimes used agriculturally for their liming potential.
Ash generation rates are approximately 0.04 TPT from Georgia pulp
mills. Ashes from different fuels will have varying metal
content. Ash from burning tires will contain zinc. Some pulp
mills in Georgia burn only wood and bark; other mills primarily
burn some mixture of coal, wood, fuel oil, or natural gas. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lime Mud </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Lime mud is also disposed of as a solid waste. Pulp mills have
lime kilns for regenerating lime mud from the liquor recovery
process. Often lime kiln capacity does not meet mill requirement,
thus requiring disposal of lime mud and purchase of fresh lime.
Waste lime mud generation is only related to kiln capacity, not
production. Waste lime mud generation of up to 200 tons per day
is reported. Other lime related wastes are green liquor dregs and
slaker grits in relatively low volumes. Burning of noncondensable
gasses in lime kilns can also increase the volume of grits and
dregs generated. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Undigested Knots</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Knots generated in the digester and are resin-loaded pieces of
wood that are not fully digestible due to poor impregnation with
cooking liquor and high lignin content. This material is
separated from digested pulp in various screening operations.
Some mills mechanically break the knots down and reintroduce them
to the digester or pulp stream. Other mills dispose of knots as a
solid waste or burn for energy recovery. Undigested knots also
contain black liquor and are a source of air emissions. </p>
<p><strong>Wastewater</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Process Wastewater </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Water is the largest raw material input in the pulp and paper
industry. Georgia integrated brownstock mills will use 5,000 to
12,000 gallons per ton of production. Bleached pulp mills in
Georgia have water usages ranging from 13,000 to 25,000 gallons
per ton; approximately 50% is used in the bleaching process.
Specialty pulp mills can approach 40,000 gallons per ton. Recycle
mills also use a considerable amount of water. The lowest water
usage noted during this study was 810 gallons per ton at
Sweetwater Paper Board, a corrugated recycling mill located in
Austell, Georgia. The highest usage was over 17,000 gallons per
ton in a recycling mill with deinking processes and bleaching. </p>
<p>Wastewater as previously discussed can contain methanol,
chlorinated compounds, cellulose, and other materials. Wastewater
removes undesirable material from the process and carries them to
a treatment system to partially concentrate and remove,
stabilize, or destroy those materials that could damage the
environment prior to releasing the water. Wastewater is generated
in every washing stage, as well as in the woodyard and chemical
generation. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Storm Water </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Storm water may be affected by chipping dust that escapes as
fugitive releases from the chipper or chip piles. Bark, debarking
dust, and other woody debris are lost around the edges of
woodyards. This material was obviously present on the ground
around some manufacturing plants visited. Storm water
contamination with wood dust is not likely to cause long term
problems such as ground water contamination, but can prompt
complaints from neighbors, block storm drains, and foul standing
water. Storm water runoff is often captured and treated. Wood
yard areas and areas where pulp or pulping chemicals are spilled
do contribute to storm water pollution and increased treatment
costs. Mills typically collect and treat storm water from outside
production and storage areas. Increased BOD is the primary storm
water pollutant. </p>
<p><strong>Hazardous Waste</strong> </p>
<p>Hazardous waste is generated by pulp mills but not in large
quantities. Maintenance wastes from degreasing and painting are
typical waste sources. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Barriers ">Pollution Prevention Barriers </a></h3>
<p><strong>Economic Barriers</strong> </p>
<p>The greatest barrier to pollution prevention in the pulp and
paper industry is economic. A pulp mill is a large scale, mostly
in-line production process composed of large and expensive
devices. In-line production means that all of the product passes
through each process component. If one piece fails, then the
entire mill ceases to function. There are exceptions. Older mills
tend to have many batch digesters while newer and upgraded mills
use one or two continuous digesters. Process change becomes
riskier as mills move more to in-line production. </p>
<p>A large integrated pulp mill producing 2,000 tons per day of
product will cost almost $1 billion to construct if built today.
Recovery boilers can cost up to $100 million for new
installations. In addition to expensive equipment, the product is
very expensive. Virgin bleached pulp prices have been in excess
of $1,000 per ton. Upgrades to a pulp mill could require many
weeks of construction. A single week of downtime could cost $14
million in lost sales. For these reasons, changes in technology
are not implemented until the risk of failure is very low and
economic payback high. </p>
<p>Newer pulping technologies are definitely more efficient that
older technologies. Due to the cost of equipment and upgrades, it
is difficult to justify major changes or replacement of entire
systems until the working life of existing equipment has been
reached. </p>
<p><strong>Technological Barriers</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Kraft Pulping</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>The Kraft process is the leading pulping technology in
Georgia. Mechanical pulping is used at one mill. Kraft pulping in
many ways has remained unchanged; wood, water, energy, NaOH, and
Na<sub>2</sub>S are the traditional process inputs. Wastes
generated are methanol and other various organic chemicals, solid
waste, wastewater, sulfur compounds, and waste heat. Reduction in
pollution has resulted primarily from pollution control measures
such as combustion of vented gasses and scrubbing combustion
stack gasses. Equipment modification to improve boiler combustion
efficiency has also reduced emissions. Pollution prevention
techniques have resulted in improved recovery of NaOH and Na<sub>2</sub>S,
reduced water usage, and reduced energy usage. Even with these
improvements, the Kraft pulping process will continue to produce
organic waste. Environmental pollution reduction from the Kraft
process will continue to be primarily capture and control since
there are few if any methods available for eliminating pollution
at the source. Use of catalysts and enzymes in pulping represents
the first new technology changes in many years. Catalysts are
discussed later in the report under Alternatives to Chlorine
Bleaching. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bleaching and Pulp Washing</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, pulp washing and bleaching are continuing
to change to reduce waste. Economic barriers and some technical
barriers still exist in implementing pollution prevention
technologies in bleaching and pulp washing, but there appears to
be a steady evolution of these processes to reduce waste and
cost. </p>
<p>Technological evolution in bleaching is evident by reviewing
the existing bleaching technologies in 1995 compared to 1970.
Bleaching began almost exclusively using chlorine and sodium
hypochlorite. Due initially to dioxin concerns in the 1980s,
alternatives to chlorine were researched and implemented.
Chlorine dioxide has now either totally or partially replaced
elemental chlorine and sodium hypochlorite. Oxygen and peroxide
are also now used in bleaching and prebleaching stages. In
addition, various methods to improve delignification in the
pulping stage have been developed which reduce the dependence
upon chlorine in bleaching. </p>
<p><strong>Organizational Barriers</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lack of Pollution Prevention Programs</strong><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>The typical pulp or paper mill in Georgia does not have a
program in place to evaluate wastes and develop methods of
reducing. The primary focus of pulp mill personnel is to keep the
mill in production by meeting quality, production, and
environmental regulatory mandates. Mill personnel are extremely
busy; tasks beyond the normal scope of work are commonly handled
by using consultants. Pulp and paper mills use external
consultants for environmental and design services. Through
organizations such as the Technical Association of the Pulp and
Paper Industry (TAPPI), the National Council of the Paper
Industry for Air and Stream Improvement (NCASI), the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other pulp and paper
trade associations, technologies that improve environmental
performance are well known to both mill personnel and
consultants. For this reason, new mills are constructed with
leading edge technologies; many older mills have also upgraded.
Several pulp and paper manufacturers have corporate programs to
reduce waste. In general, these programs are designed to identify
and evaluate those leading edge technologies. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lack of Waste Accounting</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the more mundane aspects of waste minimization and
pollution prevention are overlooked. Mills have various means of
accounting for waste generation, but these methods mostly focus
on major waste steams. Ash generation, sludge generation, solid
waste generation, and overall water usage are known. Specific
sources of waste and water usage are unknown. Georgia pulp mills
generally account for waste generation and cost as overhead. Most
mills have not attempted to trace waste generation back to
individual processes. In some of the mills, water usage was only
known as a total volume. Flows to individual processes, and waste
materials contributed to the wastewater stream by individual
processes are unknown. Approximately 50% of the Georgia pulp
mills have formal pollution prevent plans to evaluate waste and
implement waste minimization methods. Even the mills with formal
pollution prevention programs tend to look toward the
technological solutions and not the simpler methods such as
materials management. The simpler methods often require a
significant investment of time to develop and implement, but can
have very large financial returns. </p>
<p>Air emissions by pulp and paper mills are calculated using
emission factors or they are measured. Emissions factors provide
an estimate of the amount of a chemical emitted per ton of pulp
production. Emission factors are based on the type of equipment
used to produce pulp. For example, the emissions factor for
estimating methanol emissions from a batch digester and blow tank
will be greater than the emissions factor for a continuous
digester on a per ton basis. NCASI, EPA, and other organizations
publish emissions factors. Emissions calculated by using
emissions factors may be higher or lower than measured values
depending upon a number of factors. The general state of repair
of equipment can also affect emissions; additional emissions due
to failures may not be calculated when using emissions factors
according to some mill personnel. In one facility, the pulp
washer appeared to have some seal damage in an access door
emitting steam, liquid, and odor. Other mills had darkly colored
liquid streams escaping from pulp washers and storage areas. In
every case, the liquid was collected in sewers for treatment at
the mill's treatment plant. Air emissions from these failures may
not be estimated by using emission factors according to some pulp
mill personnel. The use of emission factors does not seem to
provide an incentive for repair of relatively minor system leaks
such as these. Measurement of emissions may not provide an
incentive either since emissions from leaks or failures would be
only measured if sensors were located in close proximity or were
intentionally measured. Leaks from equipment in disrepair do
increase operating cost and actual emissions. Preventive
maintenance and leak repair should be included in all pulp mill
procedures. Mills that have few leaks, few spills, and maintain a
high level of housekeeping may release fewer air emissions than
mills that do not maintain equipment or housekeeping as well.
However, reported emissions for the two situations may be the
same based on stack measurements or emissions factors. </p>

offers the use of a 20 ton per day pulp mill for research of
ozone, chlorine free, enzyme assisted, and other bleaching and
deinking technologies. </p>
<p><strong>Corporate and Facility Pollution Prevention Programs </strong></p>
<p>Several of the Georgia mills use their corporate engineering
and technical resources to reduce waste. Other plants have mill
personnel who measure and characterize waste streams with the
goal of reducing waste. Whether using corporate or plant
personnel, some mills actively track waste generation to the
source and seek ways to reduce. A case study is attached in
Appendix I describing Weyerhaeuser's approach to waste
minimization. Tenneco, Weyerhaeuser, Georgia-Pacific, Fort
Howard, Southeast, Federal, Gilman, and Rayonier are some of the
major pulp and paper manufacturers in Georgia with waste
minimization programs. In each case, the specific goals and
methods may be very different depending upon the organization. </p>

<h3><a name="Key">Key Pollution Prevention Issues</a> </h3>

publications. </p>

</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Facility"><strong>Lack of Facility Pollution
Prevention Programs</strong></a><strong> </strong></h3>
<p>A number of mills do have formal pollution prevention plans
while others do not. Some of the mills are part of wider
corporate pollution prevention plans. The goals and methods used
are different for each program. Regardless of goals and methods
used, the plans should all include waste audits that track waste
streams back to the source and estimate total costs associated
with the waste streams. Once costs are known, specific projects
can be identified that can be justified for their cost reduction
potential. Discussions with plant and corporate personnel
indicated that many of the plans do not include this basic
requirement. </p>
<p>Some of the plans were directed toward long-term technology
goals such as zero discharge of wastewater or total chlorine free
bleaching. These goals are necessary, but may be realized in 10
or more years. All current paper making technologies will not be
replaced with long-term technology changes. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Water"><strong>Water Use Reduction and Reuse</strong></a> </h3>
<p>Water is used by all pulp, paper, and recycling mills in
significant quantity. There are a number of processes which use
water and generate waste water, but the primary uses are pulp
washing following digestion and bleaching, and deinking and
washing in recycling mills. Since most water used by a pulp mill
is heated prior to use, reducing water usage can very
significantly reduce energy usage. Energy costs and savings are
often the most significant aspects of water usage reduction
programs. </p>
<p><strong>Brownstock Washing </strong></p>
<p>Pulp washing is usually done in either of four washing
systems, vacuum drum, pressure, diffusion, or Chemi. A brief
description of each is provided below. Washing is done to remove
cooking chemicals and to remove lignin breakdown byproducts as a
prerequisite to pulp drying, bleaching, and paper making. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vacuum Drum Washing</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Vacuum drum washers usually consist of three to six
counter-flow stages. Each stage consists of a rotating screen
drum which has a partial vacuum applied to the interior. The drum
sits in a tank where pulp is diluted with wash water. The vacuum
draws a pulp mat against the surface and wash water through the
mat. The drum rotation advances the washed pulp mat to the next
dilution tank. Wash water discharged from this wash stage is sent
to the previous washing stage. At least six Georgia mills use
vacuum drum washers. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pressure Washing</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Pressure washing is similar to vacuum drum, but differs by
spraying water under pressure through the pulp mat as the drum
rotates. At least one mill in Georgia uses pressure washing. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Diffusion Washing </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Diffusion washing is a counterflow process that takes place in
one or more stages. Pulp flow is upward and is carried on a
perforated plate; water flow is downward through a series of
baffles. This method offers a high degree of cleaning with low
water use. At least three mills use diffusion washers in Georgia. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chemi or Belt Washing</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>A Chemi or belt washer is perhaps the simplest washing system
design and offers reduced water usage with excellent cleaning.
Belt washing is a counter flow process where pulp enters the
washer area on a wire belt. Washing takes place under a series of
showers. Clean water enters on the opposite end from the pulp and
is sprayed vertically through the pulp. The used wash water is
then collected and reapplied to the dirtier pulp by the next
washing head countercurrent to the direction that the pulp moves.
This process is continued through at least seven stages until the
wash water is saturated with liquor after washing immediately
incoming pulp. The wash water is then sent to the recovery
process. Two mills in Georgia are known to use Chemi washers.
Reduced dilution of the liquor recovered from washing will result
in reduced energy usage in the recovery process. </p>
<p>The effluent from brownstock washing contains black liquor
that must be recovered in addition to varying amounts of water.
Diffusion washing and belt washing can reduce the amount of water
used per ton of pulp in brownstock washing by 50% or more
according to published data. However, the mills in Georgia do not
show order of magnitude reductions when using the newer washing
technologies. Comparison between mills is difficult due to
product mixes of virgin and recycled pulp; mills that have
replaced vacuum drum washing with diffusion or belt washing
report that improved cleanliness or water reductions were
achieved with the new technology, but exact figures were not
available. Improved cleanliness is important in reducing
bleaching load. </p>
<p><strong>Costs of Pulp Washing With a Chemi Washer</strong> </p>
<p>Although several mills in Georgia have upgraded pulp washing,
specific information on cost and water usage was not available.
In the EPA's document, Pollution Prevention Technologies for the
Bleached Kraft Segment of the U.S. Pulp and Paper Industry, the
following estimate was provided. </p>

        <td width="50%">Payback Period</td>
        <td width="20%">4.25 to 4.9 years</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>Due to the long payback period, replacement of vacuum drum
washers with a Chemi washer is more feasible in a new
installation or when a new washer is required to replace a vacuum
drum washer that has reached the end of its service life. The
installation cost does include all support facilities such as a
building to house the unit and piping. The actual replacement
cost would be less if support facilities were already existing.
Also, the operating cost reduction does not include savings in
the bleaching stage. Improved washing will result in less lignin
in the pulp thus reducing bleaching requirements. </p>
<p><strong>Bleach Mill Effluent Reduction</strong> </p>
<p>Washing of brownstock prior to bleaching allows the recovery
of wash effluent in the recovery boiler. Once the pulp has gone
through a chlorination stage, recovery is not practical due to
corrosiveness. Improved washing and increased delignification
prior to bleaching decreases bleaching load and reduces the load
placed on wastewater treatment. Bleach mill effluent reductions
can then best be achieved prior to any chlorination stage.
Improved delignification can allow bleached pulp mills to
eliminate certain bleaching and extraction stages while achieving
the same level of brightness. Elimination of a bleaching stage
can reduce water usage by 2,500 gallons per ton of pulp
production. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bleach Mill Effluent Recycling</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Several mills and corporate organizations are exploring reuse
or are reusing bleach mill effluent in previous bleaching stages.
Bleach mill effluent accounts for approximately 50% of a bleached
Kraft mill's water usage with effluent streams from each stage of
bleaching. Recycling water to previous stages could reduce water
usage by 60% depending upon the bleaching configuration.
Wastewater from bleaching and pulping will contain methanol,
other organics, and chlorinated compounds. Reuse in uncontrolled
areas could increase air emissions. Typically, a mill will
recycle white water from the paper machine back through the
various bleaching stages in a counter-current process. </p>
<p><strong>Other Water Use Reduction Opportunities</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Process Pump Seals</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Seal water used in various pumps has been eliminated by
replacing with mechanical face and lip seals in several
facilities around the state. Seal water flows are typically not
very high, but are continuous and can add up to large volumes
over time. Replacing water seals with mechanical seals usually
increases energy consumption due to friction. Seal water can also
be collected and reused for other processes but may contain
contaminants from the chemical passing through the pump. </p>
<p>Seals are also a source of air emissions, water pollution, and
raw material loss due to leakage of the material being pumped
through the seal. Chemical pump seals are being investigated by
some mills for replacement with sealless and magnetically coupled
pumps. An example of a sealless pump is a diastolic tube pump.
Magnetically coupled pumps transmit power from the motor to the
pump with a magnetic field. Traditionally, both designs are
better suited for low torque applications. In either case,
sealless pumps are not new technology and should work well in the
pulp industry. </p>
<p>Union Camp in Savannah has replaced water lubricated seals
with mechanical seals. According to an article published in the
November 1995 issue of &quot;Pulp and Paper,&quot; replacement of
braided packing seals with a self-lubricating compound has
reduced water usage and equipment failure. The compound used is a
&quot;colloidal mixture of lubricants amalgamated with Aragraphe
fibers&quot; manufactured by Tom-Pac of Montreal, Canada. The
sealing compound also allows leaks to be repaired by injecting
more compound into the seal. Replacement of water lubricated
seals also reduces the potential of bearing and gearbox
contamination with water, and seal water contamination with oil
or other materials. Union Camp points out that 95% of the seal
replacement projects have been successful. The benefits of this
waterless sealing compound to Union Camp have been: </p>
<ul>
    <li>reduced water usage</li>
    <li>reduced equipment damage</li>
    <li>reduced water contamination</li>
    <li>reduced maintenance time</li>
</ul>
<p>Vacuum pumps are used to supply vacuum to vacuum drum pulp
washers and other mill equipment. Vacuum pumps are typically
liquid ring pumps which use water for sealing and cooling. Water
usage is continuous and can be high depending upon the size of
the pump. Liquid ring vacuum pumps represent the common
technology used in hospitals and other facilities needing large
vacuum volumes. In resent years, oil-free and oil-flooded rotary
screw pumps have been used in some cases to replace liquid ring
pumps to reduce water usage in hospitals. This technology may be
useful in the paper industry to replace liquid ring vacuum pumps.
Water discharged from liquid ring pumps should be suitable for
reuse in any number of mill applications, but may contain some
process contaminants. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>White Water Recycling</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Paper machines can generate significant amounts of wastewater.
One mill generated 3,000 gallons per ton of paper. White water is
typically clean, but may contain some contaminants such as fiber,
lignin compounds, and various organics. Some of Georgia's pulp
mills are recycling paper machine water back to bleaching or
pulping operations. Where bleaching does not exist, white water
from the paper machine can be reused or partially reused directly
in pulp washing or in the wet end of the paper machine. One
Georgia mill recycling corrugated material reuses all white water
after clarification. The sludge that settles during clarification
is also reintroduced into the process. The company, Sweetwater
Paper discharges approximately 810 gallons per ton of pulp
produced. </p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
    <tr>
        <td width="100%">
        <p align="center"><strong>Case Study -- Recycling of
        White Water at Sweetwater Paper</strong> </p>
        <p align="left">Sweetwater Paper produces wallboard
        backing made from recycled paper. The paper is not
        deinked. Waste paper is repulped; new backing board is
        then made on a paper machine. Water removed from the
        board during sheet forming and drying is sent to a
        wastewater treatment plant where it undergoes
        clarification and pH adjustment. The majority of the
        water is then recycled with a small discharge of 180
        gallons per minute. Sweetwater manufactures approximately
        320 tons per day of wallboard backing. </p>
        <p align="left">Calcium sulphate is the most problematic
        component in the recycled water stream. Calcium sulphate
        is brought into the plant as a component of the waste
        paper. If the concentration becomes too great, calcium
        sulphate crystals can form within the plumbing system
        resulting in blockage. Sweetwater maintains solubility by
        adjusting pH and limited water discharge to prevent
        crystallization. Sweetwater discharges 810 gallons per
        ton of product, which is two to four times lower than is
        expected for this type of mill. In addition to recycling
        water, clarifier sludge is added back to the process. The
        only solid waste generated is from foreign materials such
        as plastic strapping present in the incoming waste paper. </p>

<h3><a name="Chlorine  "><strong>Alternatives to Chlorine
Bleaching</strong> </a></h3>
<p><strong>Waste Generation </strong></p>
<p>Wastes of greatest concern from bleaching are chloroform and
dioxins. Elemental chlorine and sodium hypochlorite are the two
bleaching chemicals most associated with chloroform and dioxin
formation. For this reason, most mills have eliminated sodium
hypochlorite and replaced chlorine to some degree. Of the six
virgin bleached Kraft pulp mills in Georgia, three have replaced
elemental chlorine with chlorine dioxide. The other three have
substituted varying amounts of chlorine dioxide. </p>
<p>Bleaching, as previously discussed, is a multistage process.
Historically, bleaching was considered a separate process from
digestion and began with a chlorine stage. Currently, with
elemental chlorine use in decline, it is more difficult to define
where digestion or delignification ends and bleaching begins.
Some of the pollution prevention options discussed below perhaps
are closer to delignification than bleaching in historical terms.
In either case, the basic purpose of bleaching is to further
selectively delignify pulp. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chlorine Dioxide Substitution</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Georgia pulp mills have proven that 100% chlorine dioxide
replacement for elemental chlorine is technically and
economically feasible. Mills nationally have reported pulp
quality improvements by switching to chlorine dioxide. Some mills
using less than 100% chlorine dioxide report that increases in
substitution rate are not economically feasible. The lack of
economic feasibility seems to be related to equipment costs as
opposed to chlorine dioxide cost. Replacement or upgrade of
washers, bleach tower materials, and chlorine dioxide generators
were all mentioned as needed prior to increasing substitution
rates at these mills. Full substitution can also cause reduced
pulp yield and reduced brightness according to some published
data. </p>
<p>Chlorine dioxide costs more than elemental chlorine. Even with
chlorine dioxides greater reactivity, chlorine dioxide can cost
more than eight times as much as elemental chlorine according to
EPA documents. It is estimated by the EPA that the total cost of
generating one pound of chlorine dioxide is approximately $0.50.
The cost of an equivalent amount of chlorine is $0.06. In a 1,000
ton per day mill operating at 11% substitution, an increase to
50% substitution would cost $5 million initially with an increase
in operating costs of $1.9 million annually or $5.40 per ton.
Increasing to 100% substitution would cost $15.9 million
initially with an increase in operating cost of $7.1 million
annually or $20.30 per ton. Considering that pulp prices can
approach $1,000 per ton, 100% substitution represents an increase
in operating cost of about 2%. These estimates are based on
general averages and not one particular mill. </p>
<p>Reducing dependence on chlorine bleach can best be achieved
prior to bleaching. Bleaching is basically an extended chemical
delignification process. Chlorine is used to selectively
delignify pulp without causing the damage to cellulose that
traditional pulp digestion causes. The key to reducing chlorine
use is to find methods which delignify further prior to the
bleaching stage. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Chip Uniformity</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Uniform, thin chips achieve a greater degree of
delignification in standard or modified cooking processes by
allowing the chip charge to reach a predictable amount of
digestion using a specific chemical and thermal mix. Various
methods are available and include improved screening and
rechipping of oversized chips. This is a lower cost option for
improved delignification with or without bleaching. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Extended Delignification </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A number of methods exist for improving delignification
without extensive cellulose degradation. At least four mills in
Georgia use extended delignification techniques. These techniques
are primarily applicable to continuous digesters. New digesters
can cost upwards of $15 million. Some Kamyr digesters, which are
the most common type, can be refitted at costs reported in the $1
million range. Batch digesters can also be refitted in some
cases. Reduced operating cost by refitting results in payback
periods of approximately 18 months according to EPA documents.
The cost savings are reported to be in steam and reduction in
bleach chemical usage. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Oxygen Delignification </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Oxygen delignification requires the addition of a reaction
tower between the brownstock washers and bleach plant. Oxygen and
sodium hydroxide is added to brownstock. Reduction of bleaching
chemistry by 50% can be achieved in the bleaching process if
preceded by oxygen delignification. Washing follows oxygen
delignification; effluent can be recovered or discharged. At
least two Georgia mills use oxygen delignification. Cost of
building a new oxygen delignification tower can be in the $10 to
$30 million range, but may be offset by reducing bleaching needs.
Operating costs have been estimated to decrease by up to $3.70
per ton for softwood and to increase by up to $6.65 per ton for
hardwood based on studies conducted in Sweden and published by
the EPA. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ozone Delignification and Bleaching</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Ozone delignification is not used by any Georgia mills; only
one full-scale mill operates within the U.S. Ozone
delignification is similar to oxygen delignification. The Union
Camp mill in Franklin, Virginia, began operation in 1992 with an
OZEoD extended delignification and bleaching process at 1,000
tons per day of bleached kraft production. The overall
installation cost was $113 million. Operating costs of the OZEoD
delignification and bleaching process are reported to be about
50% less when compared to the more conventional CEDED or DEDED
process. D represents chlorine dioxide, E represents extraction,
O represents oxygen, and Z represents ozone. There is one pilot
mill in Georgia capable of ozone delignification and bleaching.
The mill is operated by the University of Georgia for the use of
the school and industrial customers for research. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Alternative Chemicals Used in Bleaching</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Chlorine and chlorine dioxide are the only bleaching chemicals
used in Georgia by virgin Kraft pulp mills. Oxygen and peroxide
are used to augment sodium hydroxide extraction. Oxygen and
peroxide act to delignify in the extraction stage essentially
replacing chlorine in later stages. Sodium hydrosulfite is used
by one mill in a bleaching operation producing newsprint. No
Georgia mills use ozone in bleaching, although ozone bleaching is
used in a pilot mill in South Carolina and a full-scale mill in
Virginia. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Enzyme Bleaching</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Enzymes are used by wood eating insects and bacteria to break
lignin bonds or to delignify pulp. Xylanase is an enzyme family
related to the chemicals secreted by such bacteria; it appears to
be useful in pulp bleaching, extended delignification, and
deinking. Mills nationally have used this chemical in trial runs;
results indicate that up to 50% reductions in chlorine
requirements can be achieved without damage to the cellulose.
Application of xylanase appears to be simple. Following
brownstock washing, xylanase is applied to the pulp as it enters
the high density storage tank. Xylanase works in the high density
storage tank and requires between 30 and 180 minutes of reaction
time. A washing stage follows the xylanase treatment. No Georgia
mills report using xylanase, but it appears to be a low cost
method of achieving significant results. Other enzymes such as
mannanase are being investigated. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Catalyst Improved Delignification </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Anthraquinone </p>
<p>Anthraquinone is a pulping reaction catalyst which was found
to increase the speed of pulping, increase yield, and reduce
pulping chemical usage by up to 10%. Anthraquinone is one of the
few new technological discoveries in the Kraft pulping field. Due
to cost, anthraquinone has not been used extensively in the U.S.
except in testing. Approximately 100 mills worldwide use
anthraquinone. Although developed as a pulping pollution
prevention technology, it may have greater use and be more cost
effective if used as an aid to extended delignification. The cost
of anthraquinone is expected to drop in the near future due to
patent expiration. Renewed interest may develop as a result.
Anthraquinone has been estimated to increase pulping costs by
approximately $5.00 per ton, but with increased yields of 0.75%
and reduced recovery boiler loading. An increase yield of 0.75%
represents an increase in production of 7.5 tons per day in a
1,000 tons per day mill. </p>
<p>Polysulfide </p>
<p>Polysulfide is another catalyst mentioned in trade magazines
applicable in pulping. Yield increase of 1.5% are possible with
improvements in strength. It is possible to use both
anthraquinone and polysulfide together. TAPPI publications report
that yield increases of approximately 2.5% are possible. </p>

<h3><a name="Log"><strong>Log Yard Waste Reduction</strong></a> </h3>
<p><strong>Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<p>Log yard waste is for some mills the largest solid waste
stream. Mills with on-site landfills will often use some of this
material as landfill cover, but there is often more waste than
needed for this purpose. Log yard wastes are typically bark and
woodchips mixed with soil, oversized logs and undersized limbs,
metal-containing logs, and mold damaged chips. Energy usage in
the form of fuel for log handling trucks is another raw material
input. In addition to pulp mills, saw mills, plywood plants, and
similar facilities will have log or wood yards and use some of
the processes described below. </p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Log Yard Operations</strong> </p>
<p>The purpose of a log yard is to receive incoming logs and
chips, debark logs, chip logs, and store bark and chips. Logs,
chips, and bark are delivered by truck and rail. These materials
are stored in stacks or piles. Logs are handled either by
rail-mounted cranes or large wheeled log trucks. Logs and chips
are stored by using some inventory management program to reduce
weathering and spoiling. </p>
<p><strong>Specific Causes of Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bark and Chip Contamination</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Bark and wood chips that become mixed with soil cannot be used
for fuel or pulping. Both materials fall from the margins of
piles and become soiled. Additional bark falls from logs prior to
debarking as a result of handling. All log yards are outside
facilities. Some are partially or completely paved. Others are
completely unpaved. Soil that becomes mixed with chips and bark
comes from exposed soil in the log yard. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Over-sized Logs</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Oversized logs are logs that are too large to be debarked or
chipped by mill equipment. The material is delivered to mill log
yards by truck and rail. Delivery of oversized logs is caused by
a lack of incoming material inspection. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Metal-containing Logs</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Metal-containing logs have nails or wire imbedded in the logs.
The metal may not be visible, but is detected electronically on
the chipper or debarking decks. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Woody Debris and Soil</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Undersized limbs and other debris such as soil and sand are
delivered attached to logs or trapped between logs. Soil and sand
is also delivered with bark and wood chips that are manufactured
offsite. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Decay</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Various molds damage logs and chips. The length of time stored
as well as weather conditions contribute to mold growth. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Poor Log Yard Layout </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Fuel usage can be significant. In one logyard that was handled
entirely by log trucks, an estimate of the miles traveled
annually by log trucks totaled 17,000 miles. The distance driven
contributes to fuel usage and maintenance costs. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Log Yard Delivery Specifications</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Oversized and undersized log disposal in landfills can be
reduced to near zero. Publishing of log size standards and
rigidly enforcing delivery standards will prevent delivery of
oversized logs. Incoming inspection of logs can prevent delivery
and disposal. Oversized logs that are delivered can be cut to
smaller size so as to fit in existing equipment or sold to
specialty lumber companies and mills that can accept larger logs. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purchase of Additional Chipping Equipment</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Undersized logs can be debarked and chipped. Debarkers are
advertised in trade magazines that can handle small and irregular
shapes. Once debarked, undersized logs can be chipped. Several
mills have purchased mobile chippers to handle this material. </p>
<p>Metal-containing logs were traditionally landfilled. Some
mills cut the metal-containing area from logs. The
metal-containing portion is landfilled; the metal-free portion is
debarked and chipped. There are chippers that can chip
metal-containing logs without damage. Metal, which is most often
steel, is magnetically separated. This material can then be used
a boiler fuel or chips for particleboard manufacture. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Paving and Improving Log Yards </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Paving log yards seem to be the best practice for reducing
soil contamination. Bark and chips that do fall onto the ground
will be less likely to become contaminated. Paved areas also
allow bark and chips to be collected for use. Maintenance costs
will probably decline for log yard trucks, debarkers, and
chipping equipment by preventing soil contamination. Log flumes
will also have reduced soil loading. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chip and Bark Cleaning</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Wood chips and bark that has become contaminated with soil can
be cleaned in vibratory screening systems. Several mills are
considering screening systems. The bark and chips would be used
as fuel after screening. Soil and fines can be used as landfill
cover or other soil use. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Log Yard Layout </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Fuel and truck maintenance costs can be reduced by designing
log yards to reduced distance driven. Time and material flow
studies are commonly conducted in manufacturing plants to reduce
fork truck travel and travel time. The same techniques and
benefits could be realized in log yards. </p>

<h3><a name="Lime"><strong>Lime Mud Waste Reduction</strong></a><strong> </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<p>Lime mud waste is directly related to lack of lime kiln
capacity. Some mills dispose of up to 200 tons per day. Lime mud
disposed of must be replaced by purchasing calcium oxide.
Disposal and purchase increase operating cost and fill landfills.
There is some offsite reuse of lime mud, but the majority is
disposed in landfills or storage lagoons. </p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Lime Kilns</strong> </p>
<p>Lime kilns are typically long rotating tubes where combustion
gasses and calcium carbonate pass through changing calcium
carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. Heat loss is great
since insulation is difficult to apply to the rotating housing.
Downtime is one reported additional problem. For various reasons
such as mechanical failure, kilns are often offline. Since pulp
mills operate continuously, lime mud produced during kiln
downtime is often landfilled. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Install Second or Larger Lime Kiln</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some mills have increase kiln capacity by adding second kilns.
In some cases, Georgia mills have reclaimed tons of lime mud
stored in treatment lagoons after adding kiln capacity. Kilns are
high cost devices. The economics of installing a new kiln are not
known. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vertical Kilns</strong><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>Vertical lime kilns can offer reduced down-time, improved
energy efficiency, and larger kiln capacity in a smaller
footprint area. Vertical kilns have not traditionally been used
due to some manufacturing limitations. A NICE3 grant was awarded
to Altex Incorporated to develop a vertical lime kiln; the pilot
plant tests are targeted to Weyerhaeuser's Flint River Plant in
Oglethorpe, Georgia. More information is contained in Appendix
II. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Energy"><strong>Energy Conservation and Recovery</strong></a><strong> </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<p>Energy is heavily used by the pulp and paper industry. Most
mills generate steam and electricity by burning black liquor,
coal, wood, and natural gas. Coal combustion is responsible for
much of the sulphuric acid and sulphur dioxide emissions reported
on the TRI. Additional expense to pulp mills in treating exhaust
stack emissions is also incurred. Ash is also a significant solid
waste stream and disposal problem when burning coal or wood
waste. </p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Energy Generation in Georgia Mills </strong></p>
<p>Mills typically burn wood both as an energy source and
disposal method to reduce volume. Mills that cannot meet their
energy needs from wood waste and black liquor combustion purchase
additional fuel in the form of wood, coal, bark, fuel oil, and
natural gas. Some mills have chosen to only burn wood since it is
a low sulphur fuel source. Many mills generate excess electricity
to sell back to utility companies or participate in the
utilities' power grid load management program. This can be a good
source of revenue for some mills. The majority of energy is used
to generate steam to heat water, processes, or generate
electricity. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options </strong></p>
<p>Sulphur emissions and ash generation can be reduced by burning
less fuel. Less fuel will be burned if the energy demand of the
mill is reduced, and energy value of the fuel is maximized. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Water Usage Reduction</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Since water is generally heated prior to use in mill
operations, water usage reduction will reduce energy costs. If a
heated water flow at 180 F is reduced 100 gallons per minute, the
annual water reduction is 50,400,000 gallons. The energy
reduction assuming 65 F ambient is 46,368,000,000 BTU. Assuming
that water costs $2 per 1,000 gallons, water costs will reduce
$100,800. Energy costs will reduce $289,336 assuming an energy
cost of $6.24 per million BTU. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Thermal Energy Recovery</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Energy demand can be lowered in pulp and paper mills by
capturing and reusing waste heat. Energy lost through cooling
towers, exhaust stacks, wastewater, and product can all be
recovered for reuse. Heat recovery and utilization opportunities
vary at each mill depending upon the mill age and layout. One
mill in Georgia has identified several recovery opportunities. In
this one mill specific example, recovery of heat from wastewater
by installing liquid-to-liquid heat exchangers to heat incoming
process water was estimated to cost approximately $1 million for
installation with a payback of less than two years. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Efficiency</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Energy requirements can be lowered by using more efficient
equipment such as high efficiency electric motors or by
redesigning processes. For example, energy required for drying
can be reduced by decreasing water content of pulp before drying. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Recommendations for Reducing
Energy Usage</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Conduct Energy Audits</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>A complete energy assessment should be conducted at each
facility to identify opportunities. Oglethorpe Power and Georgia
Power, the primary suppliers of electricity in Georgia, both will
conduct very thorough audits complete with recommendations and
cost / benefit estimates. The Energy Analysis and Diagnostic
Center (EADC) of Georgia Tech's Economic Development Institute
also performs advanced energy audits. EADC can be contacted by
calling (404) 894-3844. Some of the common opportunities
identified through audits are: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Replacing cooling towers with heat exchanger loops to
        heat supply water. </li>
    <li>Recovery of steam condensate. </li>
    <li>Recovery of &quot;low grade&quot; heat from hoods, vents,
        and waste water. </li>
</ul>
<p>Specific recommendations will vary at each mill location. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Fuel Storage </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The energy value of wood chips can be increased by decreasing
moisture content. Moisture content will increase in chips stored
in piles outdoors. Placing a cover over chip and bark fuel piles
is one method of reducing moisture, increasing energy value, and
decreasing decay. Mills will sometimes store pulp chips in silos;
this would be a good storage method for fuel as well. Turning
chip piles is another method of decreasing decay and moisture
content. Energy values can increase 10% or more by decreasing
moisture content, with a resulting 10% reduction of ash, fuel
demand, and some air emissions. </p>

<h3><a name="Needs">Pollution Prevention Assistance Needs of the
Georgia Pulp and Paper Manufacturing Sector</a> </h3>
<p><strong>Organizational Needs</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Education on the value of pollution prevention
        programs that provide for audits, waste cost accounting,
        and implementation of projects.</strong><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>This information may allow mills to upgrade existing outdated
technologies by proving or disproving cost effectiveness for
specific projects. Opportunities that are not obvious to mill
personnel can be identified by conducting audits. </p>
<p><strong>Technical Needs </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Information on leading industry and standard pulp
        and paper technologies. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mills are generally aware of the major technologies used by
the pulp industry. Specific information on the benefits of
specific technologies is still needed. Several mills indicated
that leading technologies such as belt washers and pressure
washers had been installed, but provided less than expected
performance. Technologies used by other industries for
maintenance cleaning and coating, or water filtration may be of
use to pulp and paper mills in replacing processes. Several
requests for this type of information were made by mill staff
during research for this paper. </p>
<p><strong>Technology Research Needs</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Research</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Basic research needs of the pulp and paper industry are being
met by various trade and educational institutions. Research
currently focuses on enzyme and catalytic augmentation of current
processes. Additional research involving zero-effluent mill
design is ongoing. Some industry experts predict that the next
century will bring totally biologic and enzymic pulping and
bleaching which will reduce energy and chemical use. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Applied Research</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Of greater interest to pulp and paper mills is bringing
current laboratory technology to the pulp mill. Enzymes,
catalysts, alternative bleaching, water reuse technology, and
advances in lime calcining are areas of applied research
interest. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Approaches">Approaches to Meeting Assistance Needs
of Georgia Pulp and Paper Manufacturers</a> </h3>
<p>The following section discusses how P<sup>2</sup>AD will meet
the pollution prevention needs of Georgia mills. </p>
<p><strong>Meeting Organizational Needs</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Provide Pollution Prevention Training </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Organization needs are primarily education and training of
mill management and production staff on the pollution prevention
techniques. The ultimate goal is to have each mill conduct
pollution prevention assessment, evaluate results, and implement
cost-effective solutions. Several Georgia mills and corporate
organizations do have working pollution prevention plans in
place. </p>
<p>Two roles that Georgia P<sup>2</sup>AD (in conjunction with
Georgia Tech, UGA, IPST, Herty Foundation, etc.) can play in pulp
and paper mill pollution prevention planning are to improve
awareness among mill personnel and to facilitate communication
between different pulp mills. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Facilitate Exchange of Information Between
        Manufacturers</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Facilitation can occur by identifying successful pollution
prevention programs in pulp mills and educating other mills of
success and opportunities identified. Publicizing successes
through published information and providing public forums for
information exchange are the methods that P<sup>2</sup>AD and its
partners can use. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Provide Experienced-based Training to Georgia
        Mills</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Teaching and training mill personnel by offering industry wide
and mill specific workshops are the suggested approaches for
providing general pollution prevention training. Specific
training on pollution prevention techniques applicable to a
particular mill process is also needed. In order to meet these
needs, P<sup>2</sup>AD and its partners must develop greater
expertise in pulp and paper mill processes. P<sup>2</sup>AD will
gain the needed expertise by participating in training offers
extended by some of Georgia's paper mills. Additional expertise
will be gained by conducting assessments with mill personnel at
Georgia facilities. Contacts made during the research for this
paper will likely lead to assessment opportunities. Training can
take place by attending courses and seminars offered by TAPPI and
other pulp and paper organizations. </p>
<p><strong>Meeting Technical Needs</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Publish Fact Sheets and Case Studies on New and
        Standard Technologies</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Technical needs are primarily information on new technologies
as well as information on industry standard technologies for
reducing waste and cost. Fact sheets providing general
information on new technologies can be developed and can include
enzyme, catalytic, and ozone processes. Case studies of
implementation of mill standard technologies can be developed
also and can include continuous digestion, belt washing,
diffusion washing, extended delignification, oxygen
delignification, and other mill processes. This information can
also be presented in public forums at technology conferences.
Cost reduction is perhaps the key issue when presenting case
studies. </p>
<p><strong>Meeting Research Needs </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Existing Research Resources </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD can aid in meeting applied research needs by
encouraging the use of existing state resources such as IPST,
Herty Foundation, and the research pulp mill at the University of
Georgia. The NICE3 project with Weyerhaeuser and Altex is one
such applied research project. Results of this project and other
paper industry related projects will be provided to Georgia mills
through fact sheets and workshops. P<sup>2</sup>AD will
investigate state and national resources for pilot studies in
pulping, bleaching, and paper making. This information can be
distributed through fact sheets and workshops. </p>
<p>Any new or existing basic research needs can be identified
though mill and corporate contact. P<sup>2</sup>AD will attempt
to find existing research programs addressing a particular need.
If research is not ongoing, contacts can be made at various
educational and industry organizations to determine a course of
action. This may include finding researchers with appropriate
expertise, additional industries interesting in funding research,
and other financial assistance sources. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Conclusion">Summary and Conclusion </a></h3>
<p>The purpose of this study is to identify the pollution
prevention needs of the Georgia pulp and paper industry. This
information will be used to develop programs within P<sup>2</sup>AD
or through partners to address industry needs. Some of the needs
and methods of meeting needs are listed below. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Significant opportunity does exist within Georgia pulp
        and paper manufacturers to reduce waste. Waste reduction
        has been accomplished at several mills by implementing
        pollution prevention programs to identify opportunities
        and implement cost-effective solutions. P<sup>2</sup>AD
        can provide the greatest assistance by facilitating the
        development of programs in all mills. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Georgia mills need information to replace existing
        processes with more efficient technology. P<sup>2</sup>AD
        can assist by developing case studies for various mill
        standard and cutting edge technologies. Mills can also
        benefit by learning of technologies used by other
        manufacturing sectors to reduce waste from maintenance
        and other non-process related operations. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Applied research is needed to industrialized new
        technologies. P<sup>2</sup>AD can educate mills on
        various applied research projects and resources in
        Georgia and nationally. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>New basic research needs probably exist concerning such
        issues as enzyme use. These issues will be identified
        through discussions with mill, corporate, trade, and
        research organizations. P<sup>2</sup>AD can assist in
        matching research needs with the appropriate technical
        and financial resources. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD will continue to seek educational
        resources for P<sup>2</sup>AD and partner organization
        staff with the goal of becoming well informed on pulp and
        paper mill industrial practices. P<sup>2</sup>AD cannot
        provide adequate assistance to Georgia mills without
        achieving a high level of expertise in pulp and paper
        technologies. </li>

<h3 align="center"><a name="APPENDIX I">APPENDIX I</a> </h3>
<p align="center"><strong>AN APPROACH TO SOLID WASTE MINIMIZATION
IN THE PAPER INDUSTRY </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Manfred K. Buder, Solid Waste
Minimization Project Manager Weyerhaeuser Company - Tacoma,
Washington</strong> </p>
<p>Since the late 1980s the paper industry has written numerous
success stories in the reduction of the solid waste it generates
and disposes. According to a survey by NCASI (National Council
for Air and Stream Improvement), in 1989, the industry generated
over 13 million tons of process wastes, nearly all of which were
land filled. Most of this waste consists of effluent treatment
solids (&quot;sludge&quot;), boiler ash, lime wastes, and wood
debris. In recent years the industry has made inroads in shifting
much of these residuals to useful alternative practices, such as
energy recovery and land application. </p>
<p>Weyerhaeuser Company ascribes to an integrated approach for
managing the solid wastes from its manufacturing facilities. This
means the coordination of a &quot;full tool kit&quot; of waste
management options and their implementation across all of
Weyerhaeuser's facilities. A key part of this strategy is to make
progress in reducing the generation of and finding beneficial
uses for these solid residual streams. There are five key drivers
for the company's waste minimization effort: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Environmental protection and tightening regulations </li>
    <li>Stakeholder expectations </li>
    <li>Company policy to conserve resources and minimize waste </li>
    <li>Landfill depletion and high replacement costs </li>
    <li>Economic benefits: avoided disposal cost and material
        recovery credits. </li>
</ul>
<p>Accordingly, Weyerhaeuser's mills in Georgia have made and are
continuing endeavors to minimize their solid waste streams. The
Flint River pulp mill recycles scrap metal, office paper, and
aluminum cans. The mill has also made significant strides to
reduce fiber loss, thereby not only conserving raw materials, but
also decreasing the quantity of primary effluent treatment sludge
that needs to be dewatered and hauled to the landfill. Our
composite panels mill at Adel provides another example of solid
waste minimization. Instead of land filling its sanderdust waste,
the mill sells it to a Florida utility company that uses it for
fuel. Per unit of product, our sawmill at Barnesville landfills
less of its manufacturing wastes that any other Weyerhaeuser
sawmill. This is largely because of the mill's resolve to recycle
these residuals as raw materials for particleboard manufacture
(at Adel), for use by horticultural and landscaping companies, as
a fuel (both internally and at Flint River), and for other
beneficial uses. The Barnesville sawmill has also undertaken
pollution prevention measures to reduce its generation of log
yard waste to a level that is unmatched by similar mills within
the company. </p>
<p>In support of this companywide effort, a technical team from
the Corporate R&amp;D group has been charged with providing
assistance to Weyerhaeuser's pulp, paper, paperboard, and wood
products mills to minimize solid waste generation and disposal.
This Solid Waste Minimization (SWMin) Team works with the mills
and with sister entities at the corporate offices to obtain data,
evaluate solid waste reduction opportunities at mills, develop
mill SWMin plans, and stay abreast of pertinent technologies. At
the heart of the program for the past several years have been the
SWMin studies conducted at Weyerhaeuser manufacturing facilities.
The SWMin Team with the help of mill staff, obtains data on
recurring, non-hazardous solid waste streams, and assists the
mills in identifying and capturing significant waste reduction
and utilization opportunities. Since the onset of the decade,
SWMin studies have been completed for nearly all of the company's
thirteen pulp, paper, and paperboard manufacturing sites. In the
last couple of years Weyerhaeuser's SWMin Team has been busy
working with various wood products facilities. </p>
<p>SWMin is a seven-step process. The first step is the planning
and coordination of the study with the mill. Second, the SWMin
Team, typically two engineers and two technicians, conduct a
week-long onsite survey to identify waste steams and their
sources/destinations, glean facts and data, take samples, and
obtain ideas and other input from mill staff. In the third step,
the solid waste streams are screened down to a manageable number
of key streams for which various short- and long-term
minimization alternatives are identified. Three screening
criteria are used: annual disposal cost, annual recovered value
of the stream, and associated environmental issues. Also, at this
point in the process the SWMin Team surveys potential uses and
users for selected residual streams as a reality check against
some of the utilization alternatives being considered. In Step 4,
the most promising combinations of waste streams and minimization
alternatives are further developed and evaluated based on roughly
estimated life-cycle economics. The &quot;top&quot; economic
opportunities are ranked by their net present values and reported
to the mill. These opportunities are reviewed and revised, as
appropriate, with mill staff in the fifth step of the SWMin
process. The purpose of this step is to select a reduction
target, finalize the SWMin project roster, and develop a
five-year SWMin plan. Step 6 is the implementation of this plan
and Step 7 is the documentation of SWMin progress against the
plan. The SWMin Team is available to the mills for technical
support during the implementation and documentation phases. Of
course, since costs, markets, production, and other things do
change over time, it will be necessary to loop back and revisit
some earlier steps in the process from time to time. </p>
<p>Typically, 50 to 100 solid waste streams, some of them very
small on a relative scale, are identified at each company pulp
and paper mill. Most of these wastes end up being land filled,
usually onsite. Others are burned, typically in the power boiler,
or land applied. Secondary effluent treatment solids are
impounded in lagoons for the most part, since few company mills
use activated sludge treatment systems. Small, but growing,
quantities of the mills' solid residuals are recycled. </p>
<p>The largest solid waste categories being generated by the
mills are various woodwastes, boiler ash, effluent treatment
sludges (primary and secondary), recausticizing wastes (dregs,
grits, lime, etc.), and general mill trash. Minimization of these
types of streams is certainly challenging. As examples, the SWMin
team and Weyerhaeuser mills have evaluated, and in many cases
implemented, the following SWMin approaches: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Woodyard debris: (1) debris separation into hog fuel,
        rocks, and fines (soil supplement); and (2) woodyard
        paving.</li>
    <li>Boiler ash: (1) boiler upgrade to improve combustion
        efficiency, (2) flyash screening and char reinjection,
        and (3) ash utilization as a soil supplement or
        construction material. </li>
    <li>Primary sludge: (1) avoiding mixture of ash, line, and
        other separable streams flowing into the primary effluent
        treatment system, (2) spill and leak control, and (3)
        recovery of fiber for internal or external use, or for
        energy recovery as a fuel.</li>
    <li>Grits and dregs: (1) purchased lime quality control, and
        (2) washing and land application. </li>
</ul>
<p>Although there are similarities among mills, the SWMin Team
found the mills to be at different stages of waste management
along the hierarchy of alternatives (i.e., from disposal up
through recycling and source reduction). However, significant
opportunities exist for cost effective improvement at each
facility surveyed. One result of these studies has been to make
the mills more aware of the solid wastes they generate, must
manage, and can minimize through examination of the projected
economic benefit. The risk mitigation &quot;stick&quot; and
opportunity &quot;carrot&quot; are significant enough to
encourage the mills to place higher priority on tracking their
solid wastes and planning for their future reduction. It is
interesting to note that those Weyerhaeuser mills that have made
the greatest effort to improve and have realized the associated
benefits tend to be the strongest advocates for further SWMin
progress. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>MISSION STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Household Hazardous Waste Work Group</strong></p>
<p>Approximately 2.4 million households in Georgia generate more
than 5.1 million tons of solid waste each year, most of which is
disposed in solid waste landfills. Approximately 0.3 - 0.5
percent of that waste may be hazardous to human health or the
environment (EPA, Proceedings of the 4th National Conference on
Household Hazardous Waste Management, February 1990). In
addition, an unknown quantity of household hazardous waste is
improperly disposed of by pouring into storm drains, dumping on
the ground, etc. A mission of the Pollution Prevention Assistance
Division (P<sup>2</sup>AD) of the Georgia Department of Natural
Resources is to instill within the public a pollution prevention
ethic which is consistent with the protection of human health and
the environment. While hazardous waste generated by households is
exempt from environmental regulations in Georgia, the issue of
how best to properly manage household hazardous products and
reduce waste is of growing concern. Household hazardous wastes of
concern are unused or contaminated consumer products such as
paints, stains, and varnishes; cleaners; pesticides, fungicides,
and herbicides; solvents; used motor oil and other automotive
fluids; and, spent household batteries.</p>
<p>The mission of the Household Hazardous Waste Work Group is to
provide the Director of P<sup>2</sup>AD with recommendations on
the feasibility of a state-sponsored program which will result in
a reduction in household hazardous waste generation in Georgia.
If it recommends that a state-sponsored program should be
established, the Work Group shall propose a list of programs and
activities. Recommendations should include the approximate cost
of implementation. Recommendations made by the work group are
non-binding. To accomplish its mission, the Work Group should
review household hazardous waste reduction and management
programs in other states, evaluate the body of literature on the
subject, and solicit public opinion and comment.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The Household Hazardous Waste Work Group was created by the
Director of the Pollution Prevention Assistance Division of the
Georgia Department of Natural Resources to recommend guidelines
for a state-sponsored Household Hazardous Waste Prevention and
Management (HHWPM) program. The work group acted in an advisory
capacity to the Director.</p>
<p>The work group's mission was to provide to the Director
recommendations on the feasibility of a state-sponsored program
which will result in a reduction in household hazardous waste
(HHW) generation in the state. The work group was asked to review
HHW reduction and management programs in other states and to
evaluate the body of literature on the subject. The work group
was also to recommend a list of actions and activities that could
potentially constitute the development of a state HHWPM program.</p>
<p>To accomplish its mission, the work group was divided into
three smaller study groups. The Issues &amp; Priorities group
focused on the issues of liability, effect of regulations, and
possible funding sources for a state-sponsored HHWPM program. The
Residuals Management group discussed management strategy for HHW
once it enters the waste stream, while the Source Reduction group
focused on education programs for consumers to reduce the amount
of household hazardous products (HHP) entering the waste stream.
These three study groups met a total of nine times over a three
month period. Additionally, the total work group met three times,
and the chair and study group chairs met twice as a small group. </p>
<p>The work group was made up of 15 citizens representing a cross
section of government, trade associations, and environmental
groups. The work group members were Thea Powell, Chair; Rick
Foote, Vice-Chair; Don Cargill, Lynn Cobb, Ric Cobb, Rick
Cothran, Mark Eisen, Steve Emmons, Olin Ivey, Linda Jones, Kathy
Kuzava, Carol Monell, Reuben Sherrill, Susan Varlamoff, and Dee
West.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>September 22, 1995</strong></p>
<p>An overarching recommendation of the work group is that the
Pollution Prevention Assistance Division should be given
responsibility to serve as the lead organization in the state for
household hazardous waste (HHW) matters. The Division should
serve as a state-wide information clearinghouse and coordination
center for HHW, although it should not directly operate HHW
programs. The Division's programs should clearly emphasize the
difference between household hazardous products (HHP) and HHW.
Once the consumer no longer has a need for the product, then it
becomes a waste. Additionally, the Division should adopt the EPA
definition of household hazardous waste, as follows: HHW is A.
generated by individuals on the premises of a residence for
individuals and composed primarily of materials found in the
wastes generated by consumers in their homes, and B. Listed as
hazardous waste in 40 CFR, Parts 261.33 (e) or (f), or hazardous
by characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity,
and/or extraction procedure toxicity.</p>
<p>The HHW Work Group recommends the following, in no particular
order, to be components of the HHW program developed by the
Division.</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 1 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote
legislation to establish a HHW prevention and management program
in Georgia.</h4>
<p>Item # 1 </p>
<p>The Division should promote legislation that will create a
fund to provide financial support to local governments and other
groups in the state who wish to sponsor HHWPM programs. The
funding sources could be any one or a combination of the
following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>landfill tipping fees</li>
    <li>percentage of waste facility receipts </li>
    <li>hazardous waste generator fees</li>
    <li>local government surcharge, i.e. surcharge on water/sewer
        bills</li>
    <li>local government revenue surcharge on selected household
        hazardous products </li>
    <li>donated services.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Division should establish written criteria for grant funds
in support of HHWPM programs. These criteria should encourage the
creation of public/private partnerships, and allow for funds to
be used for stand alone education programs or comprehensive
education/collection programs.</p>
<p>Item # 2</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote legislation that would
encourage inclusion of questions regarding proper HHW
disposal/recycling practices on various types of licensing
renewals in Georgia. For example, a question about used motor oil
recycling could be included on drivers' license renewal forms.</p>
<p>Item # 3</p>
<p>The Division should conduct further investigation into other
state or federal laws regarding labeling of hazardous household
products. The work group agrees that manufacturers are more
likely to respond to a &quot;carrot&quot; rather than a
&quot;stick&quot; approach. Therefore, P<sup>2</sup>AD should
monitor developments regarding labeling laws, and should work
with other states and the EPA Labeling Task Force to encourage
appropriate labeling legislation.</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 2 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop
guidelines for conducting Household Hazardous Waste Prevention
and Management programs.</h4>
<p>These guidelines could be in the form of a document designed
as a comprehensive guidebook for distribution to any organization
interested in sponsoring HHWPM educational and/or collection
programs. The guidebook should recognize that public, private,
and non-profit organizations are capable of sponsoring HHWPM
programs; however, special consideration should be given to
programs that are sponsored or co-sponsored by private entities.</p>
<p>The guidebook should provide, but not be limited to the
following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Approved list of technical and education resources about
        household hazardous products and waste</li>
    <li>Liability issues for consideration before implementation</li>
    <li>Priority listing of HHW based on toxicity and economics
        of collection</li>
    <li>Guidelines and recommendations for various HHWPM programs
        - i.e., implementing an education program, and holding a
        materials exchange in conjunction with a collection
        event.</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff should be trained as a resource to work with
organizations as they use the guidebook to establish HHWPM
programs.</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 3 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote pollution
prevention of HHW through education of the public with a variety
of programs.</h4>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop targeted educational materials
through a variety of media, including: TV public service
announcements; radio spots; newspaper ads; distribution of
materials through the local Clean &amp; Beautiful chapters,
Cooperative Extension Service, and other applicable networks;
fact sheets; press releases; and/or flyers. All materials should
emphasize source reduction as the preferred management option for
HHW. Educational materials designed for teachers to incorporate
into their existing curricula should also be developed.</p>
<p>Consumer-oriented materials should educate buyers on the
environmental effects of HHP and the importance of purchasing
only the quantity needed. If disposal is required then emphasis
is placed on the most environmentally appropriate method. The
Division should be involved in educating the manufacturer,
consumer, and retailer about life-cycle analysis of products.
Additionally, the Division should do more study and have more
dialog with target audiences regarding life-cycle analysis and
other issues regarding HHW that are heavily affected by
manufacturers' attitudes and business pressures, such as
labeling, packaging, etc.</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 4 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should (as funds are
available) fund several pilot HHW collection programs in the
state.</h4>
<p>The work group agreed that collection is an important part of
HHW management, but it is desirable to gather some limited data
on collection in Georgia prior to making any decisions regarding
funding for a full-scale collection program. Division-approved
pilot programs should be located in several different areas of
the state, with an emphasis on events that can provide
information to the state regarding the feasibility of varying
types of collection events (urban vs. rural areas, types of
materials collected, etc.).</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 5 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should create and/or
promote collection for certain HHW items.</h4>
<p>Item #1</p>
<p>Citizens should be encouraged to follow the waste management
hierarchy: Purchase only what is needed, and use up all of the
product to avoid the need for recycling or disposal. Collection
and disposal of HHW items should be limited to those items that
cannot be donated, recycled, recovered, or safely disposed of in
a municipal landfill or down the drain. These items include
banned pesticides, oil-based paints and paints containing heavy
metals, wood preservatives, dioxins, and pool chemicals.</p>
<p>Item #2</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote and support private sector
efforts by retailers, manufacturers, and other stakeholders for
proper recycling or energy recovery of certain items, such as
motor oil, antifreeze, brake fluid, oil filters, latex paint,
solvents, paint thinners, strippers, non-alkaline household
batteries, fluorescent light bulbs, and thermometers. As these
private sector efforts will be impacted by EPA's Universal Waste
Rule, the Division should be involved in the planning process for
state authorization of that Rule.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>MISSION STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Recognition Criteria Work Group </strong></p>
<p>The Pollution Prevention Assistance Division (P<sup>2</sup>AD)
of the Department of Natural Resources was created to develop
programs and activities which encourage Georgia industries to
implement sound pollution prevention programs. P<sup>2</sup>AD's
legislation establishes that participation by industry in the
Division's programs and activities is to be voluntary, and that
proprietary information and reports developed for industry will
remain confidential.</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD has learned that industry considers many
pollution control and other regulations to be a disincentive to
voluntary pollution prevention, and that awards and recognition
are incentives.</p>
<p>The mission of the Recognition Criteria Work Group (RCWG) is
to develop and recommend to the Director of P<sup>2</sup>AD
pollution prevention recognition criteria. Specifically, the work
group is to: 1) develop criteria by which a company would be
judged to have achieved a level of excellence in the development
and implementation of pollution prevention programs which would
qualify the company for a &quot;Certificate of Excellence&quot;;
2) develop criteria by which a company would be judged to have
achieved a greater level of excellence which would qualify the
company for a &quot;Governor's Award&quot;; and 3) develop both
performance criteria for rating a pollution prevention program
and a process through which the Director can request that EPA
and/or EPD reduce regulatory monitoring and reporting
requirements of a company which can verify, by independent
review, achievement of the required level of performance in
pollution prevention. </p>
<p>The above criteria can be qualitative and/or quantitative, the
same or different for each mission objective.</p>
<p>The work group is requested to review current literature on
OSHA and EPA recognition programs, work of the National Academy
of Standards, and other states' programs. The work group is
further requested to solicit and consider public input. The first
task to be completed by the work group is a work plan and
schedule.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee Thomas of Georgia Pacific, Inc. is to serve as chair
of the RCWG. Peter Bonacum, Roy Bowen, Steve O'Day, Elizabeth
Brock, Win Hill, Bob Woodall, Laurie Fowler, David Word, Rep.
Denny Dobbs, Carol Foley, Pete Howard, Bruce Miller, and Wesley
Wolff are to serve as members.</p>
<p>The work group is created by the Director of P<sup>2</sup>AD,
and is advisory to the Director. The work group is to dissolve
upon completion of its mission.</p>
<p>Bill Wells, P<sup>2</sup>AD's Public Information Director,
will serve as principal staff support to the work group and as
liaison for the Director. </p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The Recognition Criteria Work Group was created by the
Director of the Pollution Prevention Assistance Division of the
Department of Natural Resources to recommend guidelines for a
state-sponsored pollution prevention recognition program. The
work group acts in an advisory capacity to the Director.</p>
<p>The work group's mission was to recommend criteria by which a
company would be judged to have achieved a level of excellence in
the development and implementation of pollution prevention
programs. The work group was to recommend criteria by which a
company could qualify for a &quot;Governor's Award.&quot; The
work group was also to recommend a process by which the Director
can request that EPD reduce regulatory monitoring and reporting
requirements of those companies which have achieved a required
level of performance in pollution prevention and maintained
compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations.</p>
<p>To accomplish its mission, the work group held three meetings.
The members reviewed pollution prevention recognition programs in
other states, recognition programs of federal agencies, existing
pollution prevention/environmental reporting requirements in
Georgia, and components of a successful pollution prevention
program.</p>
<p>The work group was made up of 14 citizens representing a cross
section of industry, government and environmental groups. The
work group members are Lee Thomas, Chairman; Peter Bonacum, Roy
Bowen, Elizabeth Brock, Rep. Denny Dobbs, Laurie Fowler, Carol
Foley, Win Hill, Pete Howard, Bruce Miller, Steve O'Day, Wesley
Wolff, Bob Woodall and David Word.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
<p>The Recognition Criteria Work Group recommends that the
Pollution Prevention Assistance Division establish a program for
recognizing and rewarding exemplary efforts in the area of
pollution prevention. The underlying objective of the program
should be to encourage pollution prevention in Georgia industries
by recognizing companies that successfully practice pollution
prevention. The recognition program should foster a common agenda
of preventing pollution and waste, increasing efficiency and
improving the environment.</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should work with the Georgia Legislature and
environmental regulators to create meaningful incentives for
companies which practice pollution prevention. However,
incentives would not lessen or interfere with environmental laws
or rules.</p>
<p>The recognition program should not be overburdensome. Whenever
possible, P<sup>2</sup>AD should use existing required
environmental reports as a basis for determining those eligible
for recognition. A company's environmental compliance history
should be considered during the recognition evaluation process.
The program should be at the facility level.</p>
<p>These recommendations should be used as a guide as P<sup>2</sup>AD
develops the requirements of the recognition program. P<sup>2</sup>AD
should continue to involve the public in the development of the
program. In order for the recognition program to become
successful and achieve its objective of encouraging pollution
prevention, it must be embraced by industry, government and the
general public.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>CATEGORIES OF AWARDS</strong></p>
<p>The Recognition Criteria Work Group recommends the formation
of two categories of recognition: a certification program and the
Governor's Award. The certification program should recognize and
reward continuous performance and improvement. It should have
three levels of recognition based on performance and
accomplishment and be measured against criteria developed by P<sup>2</sup>AD.
The three levels in order of increased achievement are: entry,
achievement, and model. Each level would have its own specific
criteria defined by P<sup>2</sup>AD.</p>
<p>At every stage of certification, P<sup>2</sup>AD should, in
consultation with EPD, develop criteria which would establish
that the applicant company is in environmental compliance. A
company must participate in the certification program to be
eligible to participate in the Governor's Award program. The
Governor's Award program recognizes outstanding pollution
prevention projects by a company, individual, organization,
academia, or a government agency. Unlike the certification
program, the Governor's Award should be competitive.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>CERTIFICATION PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p>The certification program is comprised of three levels. Each
level is based on a company's level of commitment to, and
achievement in the area of pollution prevention. The first level
is the Entry Level. In order to be recognized as an Entry Level
participant, a company must meet certain criteria that
demonstrate their interest in, and commitment to, developing a
pollution prevention program. These criteria include the
following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An employee awareness program </li>
    <li>A clear understanding of pollution prevention </li>
    <li>Management and employee commitment </li>
    <li>Established pollution prevention goals </li>
</ul>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop a mechanism which would allow
it to determine if an applicant meets the above criteria and is
in compliance with all federal, state and local environmental
laws and regulations. Certification in the Entry Level program
would be renewable annually based on sustained performance.</p>
<p>The Achievement Level is the second level in the certification
program. The Achievement Level is designed to recognize companies
that have implemented a pollution prevention program. Companies
which obtain the Achievement Level incorporate pollution
prevention into their business activities and can demonstrate
commitment on the part of management to encourage pollution
prevention practices outside the company. A company must have
participated in the Entry Level for at least one year to be
eligible to apply for the Achievement Level. The criteria for the
Achievement Level includes the following in addition to the
criteria for the Entry Level:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Documented reductions of emissions and waste through
        pollution prevention. </li>
    <li>Accounting for all costs and benefits of the company's
        pollution prevention program. </li>
    <li>Reduced and/or more efficient use of resources. </li>
    <li>A community involvement/outreach program. </li>
</ul>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop a mechanism which will allow it
to determine if an applicant meets the above criteria and is in
compliance with all federal, state and local environmental laws
and regulations. Certification in the Achievement Level program
would be renewable annually based on sustained performance.</p>
<p>The Model Level, the third level of the certification program,
is the highest level of achievement. Companies in this category
are considered best-in-class facilities that have exemplary
pollution prevention programs and are recognized as industry
leaders and environmental stewards within their community. To
these companies pollution prevention is not just a commitment but
a practice which is incorporated into all business decisions.
Model Level participants not only instill the pollution
prevention ethic in their employees and vendors, but encourage
others in the community or their industry to incorporate
pollution prevention practices into their daily activities. After
two years at the Achievement Level, a company is eligible to
apply for the Model Level. In addition to meeting the criteria of
the Entry Level and Achievement Level, Model Level candidates
must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Foster a pollution prevention ethic that extends outside
        the boundaries of the company or facility. </li>
    <li>Employ practices that prevent the transfer of pollution
        to other facilities. </li>
    <li>Serve as a witness for pollution prevention practices to
        peers and the public. </li>
    <li>Assist other companies through pollution prevention
        technology transfer. </li>
    <li>Demonstrate a commitment to pollution prevention in
        product development and purchasing decisions. </li>
</ul>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop a mechanism which will allow it
to determine if an applicant meets the above criteria and is in
compliance with all federal, state and local environmental laws
and regulations. Certification in the Model program would be
renewable annually based on sustained performance.</p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Application Process</u></strong></p>
<p>Applications for the certification program should be accepted
year round. After receiving the application, the staff should
determine if the company meets the established criteria. Upon
approval, the company's compliance history should be reviewed.
Companies which have favorable compliance histories will receive
a letter announcing their acceptance in the certification
program. </p>
<p>Any company not wishing to continue to participate in the
program may withdraw. </p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Qualifications</u></strong></p>
<p>The certification program is open to any company that is
located in Georgia. A company or organization interested in
participating should submit an application. A company or
organization could be nominated by another party. Pollution
prevention projects and programs should address all media types
(i.e., air, solid waste, water). </p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Forms of Recognition</u></strong></p>
<p>Companies that achieve certification should be publicly
recognized. P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop a method for informing
the public of the certified company's achievement. Companies that
reach the Achievement Level or Model Level should be eligible for
some type of regulatory and/or financial incentives in the form
of reduced fees, expedited permitting or reduced reporting or
inspections. P<sup>2</sup>AD should consult with EPD to develop
regulatory incentives. If necessary, P<sup>2</sup>AD and EPD
should propose legislation to provide for regulatory incentives.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>GOVERNOR'S AWARD PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p>The Governor's Award for pollution prevention should recognize
special and significant pollution prevention achievements of
companies and organizations in Georgia.</p>
<p>The Governor's Award unlike the certification recognition
program should be an annual competitive award given to a company,
individual, or organization that has demonstrated excellence in
pollution prevention. A company should have participated in the
certification program at some level to be eligible for the annual
Governor's Award. This criteria would not apply to individuals,
academia, non-profit organizations or government. The award
should be presented in three categories. These categories should
be small and medium business, large business, and community
(private/individual/organization/government). There should be no
limits on the number of honorable mention certificates presented.</p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Application Process</u></strong></p>
<p>The application process for the Governor's Award should be
similar to that of the certification recognition program. The
first step should be a screening of all applicants to eliminate
those which are not eligible. P<sup>2</sup>AD should also review
the applicant's compliance history where applicable. Qualified
applications should be judged by a panel of judges including
industry peers and representatives from relevant state agencies
and universities. </p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Qualifications</u></strong></p>
<p>All eligible projects should have occurred during the calendar
year; or in the case of ongoing programs, new activities should
have occurred during the calendar year. Prior recipients are
eligible to compete for the Governor's Award the following year,
although the project must differ from the previous entry. Only
those companies who participate in the certification program
should be eligible for the Governor's Award. This would not apply
to individuals, academia, non-profit organizations or government.</p>
<p>Reductions that are the result of a process being eliminated
or transferred to another facility out of state should not
qualify as pollution prevention activities.</p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Forms of Recognition</u></strong></p>
<p>The principal award in the Governor's Award program should be
public recognition. The award should be presented to the company
by the Governor at an annual event.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>What can P</strong><sup><strong>2</strong></sup><strong>AD
do for you?</strong></p>
<p>P&#178;AD offers businesses, industries, and local and state
government agencies technical assistance in developing and
implementing pollution prevention programs. Technical assistance
is given in response to phone inquires, electronic
communications, mail, workshops, seminars, and on-site visits.
Assistance is free, confidential, and non-regulatory in nature. </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD's <a href="bio.htm">technical staff</a> can
assist you with many aspects of pollution prevention, including,
but not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>reduction of waste</li>
    <li>reuse of waste</li>
    <li>recycling of waste</li>
    <li>equipment or technology modifications</li>
    <li>reformulation or redesign of products</li>
    <li>substitution of raw materials</li>
    <li>housekeeping and maintenance</li>
    <li>training and inventory control</li>
</ul>
<p>All requests for information and services can be directed to
our information manager, Jancie Hatcher:</p>
<ul>
    <li>phone - (404) 651-5120 or 1-800-685-2443</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>P</strong><sup><strong>2</strong></sup><strong>AD
maintains confidentiality of proprietary information and client
reports.</strong></p>

Center</a></h4>

<h3><a name="Information Center">Information Center</a> </h3>
<p>The P<sup>2</sup>AD Information Center (Center) is the point
of entry for technical assistance. Answers may be in the form of
mailed publications, suggestions from staff, and referrals for
voluntary on-site assessments. </p>
<p>The Information Center, serviced by a technical staff person,
contains a library of more than 2,700 documents, journal
articles, and books pertaining to pollution prevention,
recycling, and household hazardous waste. These are used to
answer inquiries about specific pollution prevention problems.
All documents have been abstracted and catalogued in a database.
In addition to books and reports, the Center maintains more than
50 current periodical subscriptions and a collection of more than
70 videos. </p>
<p>P&#178;AD also maintains a database of pollution prevention
equipment vendors. New vendor files are added to the database at
a rate of approximately 20 every month. Currently the database
contains information on more than 200 companies and 64
consultants. </p>
<p>In addition to in-house resources, the Center has access to a
wide variety of outside knowledge. The staff routinely accesses
the holdings at the Georgia Tech and Georgia State University
libraries. P&#178;AD uses the services of the Waste Reduction
Resource Center (WRRC), a regional source for pollution
prevention information funded by EPA and the Tennessee Valley
Authority. Lastly, the staff uses the Internet (World Wide Web,
gopher sites, etc.) and electronic mailing lists to research
specific information for clients. When confronted with a
challenging situation, P&#178;AD's technical staff can pose
questions to the country's experts who may have a possible
solution or can provide contacts to furnish needed information. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="On-site Assessments">On-site Assessments</a> </h3>
<p>A visit to your facility by P<sup>2</sup>AD's engineers can
provide new insight into improving efficiency and reducing waste
for your operation. </p>
<p>In working with small companies, a P&#178;AD technical staff
person performs an assessment to identify waste generating
processes and waste streams. For larger companies, P&#178;AD acts
as a facilitator to guide company managers in a self-assessment
of their waste streams. The Georgia Tech Economic Development
Institute assists P&#178;AD staff in performing assessments as
needed. All information is confidential. </p>
<p>After an assessment is made, a written report or fact sheet is
provided to the company management offering options for pollution
prevention, estimated waste reduction, and cost savings. Report
recommendations may contain several or all of the following:
redesign of production methods, non-hazardous substitutes for
hazardous materials, advice on good operating and housekeeping
practices, strategies to reduce energy and pollutant loadings for
publicly owned treatment works, and cost benefit analysis and
payback period for pollution prevention initiatives. </p>
<p>Six months after the report is delivered, P&#178;AD conducts a
follow-up discussion with clients to learn whether the company
has implemented any of the suggestions presented and whether more
information is required. A company is not required to implement
any or all of the recommendations. Their involvement is strictly
voluntary. </p>
<p>To date, a wide variety of assessments have been performed at
companies ranging in size from less than ten to more than 25,000
employees. An assessment report varies, depending on the size and
complexity of the company's business or manufacturing processes.
Assessments have been completed for businesses in many different
sectors including auto parts and maintenance, pulp and paper,
textiles, metal fabrication, and chemical manufacturing. In
addition, the Division currently has established on-going
relationships with several large companies based in Georgia. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Employee Training Sessions">Employee Training
Sessions</a> </h3>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD provides pollution prevention training on-site
for a company's personnel. In these sessions, a cross section of
the company's employees (i.e., environmental, financial,
purchasing, upper management, line workers) can be trained
together. P<sup>2</sup>AD staff teach team building, how to do a
self-assessment on waste reduction, full cost accounting of
waste, recognizing waste reduction opportunities, and financial
analysis of pollution prevention initiatives. The objective of
on-site training is to provide information and knowledge about
pollution prevention that will be retained and used by the
company in the future. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Seminars and Workshops">Seminars and Workshops</a></h3>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD sponsors seminars and workshops throughout the
state on various pollution prevention and waste reduction topics.
Topics may be industry specific or general pollution prevention
information. Some examples of workshops conducted by P<sup>2</sup>AD
include solvent substitution; pollution prevention for the
aircraft, aerospace, and airline industry; and storm water and
pollution prevention for trucking facilities.</p>

<h2 align="center">Recognition Program</h2>
<hr>
<p>Pollution Prevention Partners (P&#179;) is a three level
certification program that recognizes and rewards continuous
pollution prevention performance and environmental improvement by
Georgia industries. Companies that qualify for the P&#179;
program demonstrate to their customers, employees, and community
a commitment to preventing pollution and waste, increasing
efficiency, and improving the environment. The P&#179; program is
administered by the Pollution Prevention Assistance Division
(P&#178;AD) of the Department of Natural Resources. </p>
<p>The Entry Level recognizes facilities or plants that
demonstrate a commitment to developing a successful pollution
prevention program. Facilities that apply for the Entry Level are
eligible for a free, on-site pollution prevention assessment and
assistance in qualifying for the program from P&#178;AD.
Facilities that qualify for the Entry Level are eligible for
recognition in P&#178;AD publications and will receive a
certificate. </p>
<p>The Achievement Level recognizes facilities or plants that
have established a pollution prevention program and are making
progress toward meeting reduction goals. Facilities that apply
for the Achievement Level are eligible for a free,
non-regulatory, on-site pollution prevention assessment and
assistance in qualifying for the program from P&#178;AD.
Facilities that qualify for and maintain the Achievement Level
will receive public recognition in P&#178;AD publications, a
plaque and up to a 10% reduction in hazardous waste trust fund
and Toxic Release Inventory fees paid to the Georgia
Environmental Protection Division (EPD) for one year. Facilities
that continue to show progress toward meeting pollution
prevention goals may receive up to a 10% reduction in fees in
each of two additional years. The savings from these fees must be
allocated to pollution prevention activities at the facility. <b>(The
ability of EPD to reduce fees is contingent upon approval by the
Georgia General Assembly and the Governor in 1997)</b> </p>
<p>The Model Level recognizes facilities or plants that are
industry leaders in pollution prevention. Model Level facilities
incorporate pollution prevention into daily business activities,
and have made substantial progress toward meeting pollution
prevention reduction goals. Facilities that apply for the Model
Level are eligible for a free, non-regulatory, on-site pollution
prevention assessment and assistance in qualifying for the
program from P&#178;AD. Facilities that qualify for and maintain
the Model Level will receive public recognition in P&#178;AD
publications, a plaque, a flag and up to a 25% reduction in
hazardous waste trust fund and Toxic Release Inventory fees paid
to EPD for one year. Facilities that continue to show progress
toward meeting pollution prevention goals may receive up to a 25%
reduction in each of two additional years. The savings from the
fees must be allocated to pollution prevention activities at the
facility. <b>(The ability of EPD to reduce fees is contingent
upon approval by the Georgia General Assembly and the Governor in
1997)</b> </p>
<p>Pollution prevention is defined by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) as &#147;the use of materials, processes,
and practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants
or wastes at the source.&#148; Examples of pollution prevention
activities include inventory management/purchasing procedures,
source reduction, process modifications, housekeeping/good
operating practices, material substitutions, redesign of product,
pollution prevention education/outreach, and in-process
recycling. Disposal, off site recycling or reprocessing of wastes
is not pollution prevention. </p>

<h3><a name="Manufacturing Sector">Manufacturing Sector</a> </h3>
<p><a name="Toxic"><strong>Toxic and Hazardous Waste</strong></a> </p>
<p>The Georgia manufacturing industry (Standard Industrial
Classification Codes 2000 to 3900) consists of more than 10,000
companies. Approximately 600 companies reported waste releases in
1994, with a total of 31,000 tons of toxic pollutants emitted to
the air, land, and waters of Georgia. Six manufacturing sectors
which release the most significant toxic chemicals were
identified from information contained in the Toxic Release
Inventory (TRI) report and the biennial hazardous waste report.
These high priority manufacturing sectors include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Pulp and Paper Products (SIC 26) </li>
    <li>Chemical and Allied Products (SIC 28) </li>
    <li>Transportation Equipment (SIC 37) </li>
    <li>Rubber and Plastic Products (SIC 30) </li>
    <li>Fabricated Metal Products (SIC 34) </li>
    <li>Printing and Publishing (SIC 27) </li>
</ul>
<p>A staff engineer was assigned to each sector to determine the
manufacturing processes used by these industries and to research
and develop pollution prevention expertise and solutions which
could be applied across the sectors. The information gained
through comprehensive technical literature reviews, extensive
telephone surveys, and conducting follow up on-site assessments
at numerous businesses within the sector is being used to prepare
sector-specific information and workshops. These outreach tools
are targeted to overcome key pollution prevention impediments
identified through the sector assessment process. </p>
<p><a name="Solid Waste"><strong>Solid Waste</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that
non-hazardous, industrial process waste constituted over 57% of
the total solid waste generated in the United States in 1985.
About 39% consisted of special wastes (e.g. fly ash, mining
wastes), 2% was regulated hazardous waste, and about 2% was
municipal solid waste (MSW). MSW is generally thought of as
household waste; however, under the EPA definition commercial,
institutional, and industrial wastes (other than process waste)
can also be considered MSW. </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD has refocused some of its resources to address
the issue of non-hazardous, industrial solid waste reduction. The
approach will rely on existing activities, programs and
partnerships to develop and provide for solid waste reduction
options to Georgia manufacturers. </p>
<p>As a means to develop more effective reduction strategies, the
Environmental Protection Division, the Department of Community
Affairs, and P<sup>2</sup>AD launched a cooperative effort to
characterize the solid waste being disposed across Georgia.
On-site surveys have been conducted at 131 state landfills. A
goal of the survey was to obtain a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the
mix of residential, commercial, and industrial solid waste
disposed at each specific landfill. With 80 percent of the
surveys completed, preliminary data indicate about 22% of the
solid waste being disposed at landfills is from industrial
sources. The principal industrial waste streams observed were
textiles, construction and demolition debris, wastewater sludges,
wood wastes, food processing wastes, auto salvage wastes, and
waste from the manufactured housing industry. </p>
<p>A large amount of non-hazardous industrial waste is also being
disposed on-site at 43 private industry landfills in Georgia.
Little information is currently available from EPD files
concerning the character of the waste; however, a shift to
off-site disposal of this industrial waste could severely affect
municipal solid waste disposal capacity. Although EPD is
responsible for monitoring these landfills, P<sup>2</sup>AD is
available to assist companies wishing to reduce their waste
streams. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="C &amp; I Sector">Commercial and Institutional
Sector</a> </h3>
<p>As part of restructuring the solid waste responsibilities in
the state, P<sup>2</sup>AD is assuming the lead state role for
commercial and institutional solid waste reduction. Commercial
sectors include office buildings, retail, and service
establishments. Institutions include school, libraries,
hospitals, and prisons. According to Department of Labor
statistics, there were about 180,500 commercial businesses in
Georgia in 1995. As indicated above, P<sup>2</sup>AD, DCA, and
EPD conducted on-site surveys of 131 landfill sites across the
state to gather characterization information. The preliminary
data indicates that approximately 33% of the estimated 9 million
tons of waste disposed in Georgia's municipal landfills is from
commercial and institutional sources. The estimation does not
take into account the waste disposed of in those commercial
landfills which keep their disposal types and quantities
proprietary. </p>
<p>Using the survey results and supplemental information, P<sup>2</sup>AD
will seek to identify specific commercial solid waste streams in
order to develop waste reduction strategies and market
development opportunities. Both the waste types and quantities
disposed are important factors in this effort. It is likely that
the commercial and institutional solid waste program will use the
six basic strategies established by P<sup>2</sup>AD in addressing
waste streams for the manufacturing sector. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Agricultural Sector">Agricultural Sector</a> </h3>
<p>Agriculture is a leading industry in Georgia contributing more
than $38 billion annually to Georgia's $180 billion economic
output. Agriculture, including the production, processing,
packaging, and transporting of farm products, employs
approximately one in six Georgians and almost half the state's
manufacturing jobs are in agribusiness. Georgia's top ten farm
commodities include commercial broilers, peanuts, cattle, eggs,
vegetables, dairy products, cotton, hogs, nursery/greenhouse, and
tobacco. Besides these commodities, the production and
distribution of farm inputs and machinery contribute an
additional $1.5 billion and employ about 15,000 people. </p>
<p>As one of the largest industries in Georgia, agricultural
production has significant potential for environmental
degradation. Contamination from agricultural practices is
estimated to contribute approximately 65% of all non-point source
pollution. Animals produced in Georgia generate an estimated 22
million tons of manure each year. In addition, yearly crop
production in Georgia uses approximately 1.67 million tons of
commercial fertilizers. Many of these nutrients, if not managed
and used properly, can degrade both the surface and ground water.
The $156 million worth of pesticides used in agricultural crop
production can also pose significant risk to environmental
resources. Agriculture also uses significant amounts of fuel,
oil, and energy, contributes millions of tons of sediment from
soil erosion, and can create many air quality concerns including
odor and dust generation. </p>
<p>The diversity of agricultural industries presents many
obstacles to the adoption of pollution prevention technologies. P<sup>2</sup>AD
recognized this need and allocated a budget to establish an
agricultural pollution prevention program in cooperation with The
University of Georgia's Biological and Agricultural Engineering
Department. The goal of the Georgia Agricultural Pollution
Prevention Program is to encourage the agricultural community to
actively practice voluntary pollution prevention with a
commitment to reducing emissions, waste, and the use of energy,
water, and dangerous materials to the greatest extent practical. </p>
<p>This program also functions using both responsive and
proactive approaches. The program supplies technical assistance
and information on pollution prevention practices to any farmer
or industry that requests it. This includes requests for
technical assistance in site selection or facility layouts,
information on new technologies or pollution prevention
strategies, and individual site assessments. On-site pollution
prevention assessments for production farms or processing
facilities are available by program staff. The agricultural
program also proactively seeks voluntary involvement and
educational opportunities. Areas where more research or
educational efforts are needed have been identified, and the
program serves as a catalyst for initiating and conducting these
types of projects. Additionally, specific elements of the program
are focused on enhancing the understanding and enlisting the
support of various agricultural organizations and agribusinesses
in promoting pollution prevention practices. </p>
<p>The Agricultural Pollution Prevention Program has accomplished
many objectives since its inception in late 1994. An initial
project was the development of two position papers that focused
on identifying the opportunities and impediments for pollution
prevention in agricultural crop production and livestock
production. These papers will serve to focus the program on
priority issues. The program has also been actively providing
technical assistance to the agricultural community. Some examples
include the development of nine publications, five news articles,
and a quarterly newsletter, responses to over 80 requests for
technical assistance resulting in over 30 site visits,
participation in 11 different training sessions for a variety of
audiences, and presentations at more than 30 conferences or
exhibitions with more than 240,000 potential contacts.
Additionally, the program is active in several applied research
projects and has developed working relationships with much of the
agricultural community leadership. </p>
<p><a name="Horticultural"><strong>Pollution Prevention Program
for the Horticultural (Green) Industry</strong></a></p>
<p>P&#178;AD has awarded two applied research grants to the
University of Georgia's agricultural experimental station in
Griffin for a horticultural demonstration project. This grant
money will be used to support the development of a 65 acre tract
of land to become The Georgia Station Research and Education
Garden. The Garden will be developed with input from the
horticultural industry and directed towards industry, gardener,
and homeowner needs with emphasis on interpretation of ongoing
research. The goals of the Garden include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Develop innovative programs that interpret research for
        the horticultural industry, homeowners, professional
        educators, gardeners and students. </li>
    <li>Develop the Garden as a stimulating location for
        educational and professional opportunities. </li>
    <li>Establish positive community relationships and facilitate
        community involvement in Garden programs. </li>
    <li>Develop a state-of-the-art research and educational
        facility with a secure funding base for Garden programs. </li>
</ul>
<p>A team of scientists has formed a working group to solve
problems for the ornamental plant industry, especially those
prevalent in the humid southeast. Areas of research will include
the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Create environmentally sound management practices. </li>
    <li>Maximize plant quality and/or adaptability for the needs
        of the end users.</li>
    <li>Improve technical and economic efficiency of commercial
        ornamental plant production and marketing. </li>
    <li>Communicate research-based recommendations to the green
        industry. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Public Sector">Public Sector</a> </h3>
<p>To broaden the Division's services to include the general
public, P<sup>2</sup>AD's mission has been expanded to address
the issues of household hazardous waste, used automotive fluids,
and radon. </p>
<p><a name="HHW"><strong>Household Hazardous Waste</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Household hazardous waste (HHW) is a product which is
discarded from a home or a similar source that is either
ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic. Examples of common
household hazardous wastes are oil-based paint, batteries,
cleaners, and pesticides. It is estimated that 1.6 million tons
of municipal solid waste disposed of per year is household
hazardous waste, or between 0.3 - 0.5% of the total municipal
solid waste stream. The numbers vary depending on the region and
the season. The number of household hazardous waste collection
programs in the U.S. has increased from 2 in 1980 to 1,648 in
1994. Based on a statewide household hazardous waste survey to
determine the storage and disposal habits of Georgians, the
majority of Georgians stated that they disposed of unwanted
household hazardous products in their trash. Most polled
indicated that the reason that they had leftover hazardous
products in their home was that they had bought too much. The
demographic information from the survey is being used to target
specific audiences that mismanage or improperly dispose of
household hazardous waste. </p>
<p>A common approach to handling HHW in many communities is
collection at recycling or drop off facilities. The high cost of
sponsoring an event and the low participation rates are two
negative aspects of collection which make this approach suspect
as a practical and economically feasible method. P<sup>2</sup>AD
is taking an innovative approach to addressing the issues
associated with improper management of household hazardous waste.
In keeping with P<sup>2</sup>AD's founding philosophy of
prevention, P<sup>2</sup>AD is focused on prevention and proper
management of household hazardous waste. The concept is simple.
Collection does not solve the problem of improper management of
household hazardous waste or encourage alternative management
methods (i.e. reuse or recycling), but only acts as a
afterthought or control mechanism to correct the mismanagement or
inefficient use of hazardous household products. Prevention
reduces or eliminates waste, thereby diminishing the need for
collection. </p>
<p>A Household Hazardous Waste Work Group was convened in January
1995 to study household hazardous waste issues and make
recommendation to the Division's Director about the feasibility
of a state-sponsored program which would reduce household
hazardous waste generation in Georgia. The recommendations were: </p>
<ol>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should serve as the lead state agency for
        HHW prevention and management. </li>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop guidelines for conducting
        HHW prevention and management programs. </li>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote pollution prevention of
        HHW through various public education programs. </li>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should fund several pilot household
        hazardous waste collection programs in the state, as
        funds are available.</li>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote collection of various
        problem HHW items. </li>
</ol>
<p>The Division's HHW activities up to the present are based on
the first three recommendations offered by the HHW Work Group.
The Division is using the work group's recommendations as
guidance to develop the format of the household hazardous waste
prevention and management (HHWP&amp;M) program. </p>
<p>It is P<sup>2</sup>AD's intention to work through local
governments to educate and inform the citizens in the state about
household hazardous waste issues. The Division is working with
UGA's Vinson Institute of Government in developing a
&quot;Household Hazardous Waste: Best Management Practices&quot;
handbook. The handbook is designed for use by local governments
to assist officials in answering citizen's inquiries about
household hazardous waste. Another handbook will be developed to
provide guidance to local governments on developing household
hazardous waste programs. In addition to the materials developed
for local governments, the Division will develop materials to
educate the public about the prevention and proper management of
household hazardous waste. </p>
<p><a name="Auto"><strong>Automotive Fluids</strong></a> </p>
<p>Over 200 million gallons of used motor oil are generated
annually by the 45 million Americans who change their own motor
oil in their cars and trucks, better known as the
do-it-yourselfers (DIYs). In 1991, DIY used oil amounted to about
15 percent of the total oil generated by all sources, but 50
percent of all the used oil that was improperly disposed of
originated from DIYs. Improper disposal of just one gallon of oil
can make one million gallons of water undrinkable. Oil and
antifreeze are also toxic to animals and marine life. Handling of
used automotive fluids by DIYs is largely unmonitored and
unregulated. However, as of 1995, 30 states and the District of
Columbia had some type of state-sponsored used oil program that
addressed the DIY population. </p>
<p>It is estimated that about 19 million gallons of passenger car
motor oil are sold in Georgia annually. Much of this oil is
purchased by DIYs. About 5.5 million oil filters are also bought
by DIYs each year in Georgia. Based on national statistics, as
much as five million gallons of used oil may be improperly
disposed of in Georgia annually. Spent filters may also be a
significant waste stream, as national statistics indicate that
approximately 90 percent of used filters are thrown into the
trash rather than being recycled. In Georgia, the state's role in
promoting recycling programs for automotive fluids and filters
has been limited. </p>
<p>In a discussion with EPD concerning household hazardous waste,
EPD requested that P<sup>2</sup>AD take on the responsibility for
the used automotive fluids program. An Automotive Fluids Work
Group was convened in late 1995 by P<sup>2</sup>AD to provide
recommendations for creating a voluntary, state-sponsored program
that would encourage the proper recovery of consumer-generated
used automotive fluids and oil filters. A statewide household
hazardous waste survey conducted by the Division in 1995
indicated that only 49% of Georgians who change their own oil
take the used oil to a collection point for recycling. The
recommendations of the work group are shown below, and are also
contained in the actions detailed later in this plan. The
recommendations were: </p>
<ol>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should &quot;benchmark&quot; all existing
        DIY collection locations within the state, and identify
        areas of inadequate collection capacity. </li>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should advertise the location of DIY
        collection sites to the public. </li>
    <li>If deemed necessary by the director, P<sup>2</sup>AD
        should sponsor legislation to put a fee on oil to fund
        the used automotive fluids program. </li>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should determine if incentives for
        participation in the used automotive fluids program are
        needed for retailers and/or the public. </li>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should establish a comprehensive
        education program to promote collection of used
        DIY-generated automotive fluids and filters in Georgia. </li>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD should attempt to clarify problems with
        legislation and regulations that hinder proper management
        of used automotive fluids. </li>
</ol>
<p>An unknown quantity of antifreeze is sold to DIYs in Georgia.
However, the HHW survey mentioned above indicated that 47% of
people who service their own cars changed their antifreeze. The
most common methods of disposal for used antifreeze were to pour
it on the ground or put it in the trash. </p>
<p>Currently, used automotive fluid collection points in Georgia
are mainly located at businesses and local governments that
volunteer to collect these fluids and filters, and they are not
required to report the amounts collected or recycled. P<sup>2</sup>AD
has &quot;benchmarked&quot; the existing DIY collection
locations, and has prepared a comprehensive listing of locations
for recycling of oil, filters, and antifreeze. </p>
<p><a name="Radon"><strong>Radon</strong></a> </p>
<p>According to the Surgeon General, radon is the second leading
cause of lung cancer in the United States. Furthermore, the U.S.
Congress' long-term goal for radon is to have the indoor radon
levels be no higher than levels outside. A survey conducted by
EPA during Winter 1988/1989 concluded that 15% of the homes in
North Georgia revealed concentrations of radon greater than 4
picocuries per liter (pCi/L). Less than 10% of the homes tested
in the rest of the state had measurements greater than 4pCi/L.
One county had several schools with all of the classrooms' radon
levels greater than 4pCi/L. </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD will serve as the lead state agency for radon.
The Division assumed the responsibility from the Department of
Human Resources under the written approval of the Governor. The
mission of the Division's radon program is to inform the public
about the health risks associated with radon, to increase
awareness about and encourage testing for radon, and to support
local government efforts to address radon issues in their
communities. </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD will work closely with all agencies and
organizations that are either involved or interested in providing
radon programs. P<sup>2</sup>AD will coordinate with the
Association County Commissioners of Georgia (ACCG) to solicit
local government support for radon programs, develop and
disseminate information to local governments, and provide
technical assistance to local governments on radon-related
issues. P<sup>2</sup>AD will also provide financial assistance to
local governments in the form of a matching grant. </p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) have combined to sponsor an innovative,
cost-sharing program to promote National Industrial
Competitiveness through Energy, Environment, and Economics. The
grant program, known as NICE<sup>3</sup>, provides funding to
state/industry partnerships for projects that develop and
demonstrate advances in energy efficiency and clean production
technologies. Since 1991, NICE<sup>3</sup> has sponsored 26
projects, totaling $7.8 million of DOE funding. </p>
<p>Industry applicants must submit project proposals through a
state energy, pollution prevention, or business development
office. P&#178;AD is an administrator for the program in Georgia
and chooses projects by evaluating them with the criteria
provided. Funds are awarded to state/industry partnerships that
can match DOE/EPA federal funds dollar for dollar. Awardees
receive a one-time grant of up to $400,000 for the proposed
project. After the initial funding, the awardee is expected to
commercialize the process or technology. P&#178;AD has partnered
with the companies listed below on two NICE<sup>3</sup> projects: </p>

<p><a name="Locgov"><strong>P</strong><sup><strong>2</strong></sup><strong>AD
and Local Government Pollution Prevention Programs</strong></a></p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD is currently undertaking outreach efforts to
inform local governments about the role of the Division and its
services. The Division is involved in ongoing relationships with
the Georgia Municipal Association (GMA) and the Association of
County Commissioners in Georgia (ACCG), and will promote the
creation of local government pollution prevention programs to
these groups' members. P<sup>2</sup>AD will work with interested
local governments to evaluate the feasibility of establishing
programs that encourage a pollution prevention ethic in local
industries, businesses, and within their own county or city
organizations. </p>
<p>The Division also seeks to encourage actions by local
governments such as the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Promoting the services of P<sup>2</sup>AD to industries
        and businesses in the local government's area</li>
    <li>Becoming participants in regional pollution prevention
        networking groups to be established statewide in 1997 </li>
    <li>Providing local recognition for businesses and industries
        in their area that are successfully pursuing pollution
        prevention activities</li>
    <li>Serving as a distribution point for educational materials
        aimed at local consumers and civic groups on topics such
        as used oil recycling and household hazardous waste
        prevention and management issues </li>
</ul>
<p>Why Local Government Pollution Prevention? </p>
<p>Local government pollution prevention programs can provide
individual assistance to local industries that augments
assistance provided by state programs such as P<sup>2</sup>AD.
Local government programs can also serve as a catalyst for
pollution prevention activities in the city or county's own
waste-generating operations. Since relationships already exist in
a community between government agencies and businesses,
industries may feel more comfortable requesting assistance from a
local government program. Local government agencies are more
cognizant of a company's culture and specific issues which may
affect a company's decision to implement a suggested alternative.
Individuals within the local government may also be more familiar
with local regulations and permitting requirements which play an
important role in deciding if a pollution prevention alternative
is feasible from a regulatory standpoint. </p>
<p>Local government programs which promote pollution prevention
represent a win-win situation for industries and the community.
By forming partnerships with businesses to encourage pollution
prevention in daily practices, local governments protect their
own community's resources while increasing the competitiveness of
the local employers. For more information on how to start a local
government pollution prevention program, contact Jancie Hatcher
at (404) 651-5120 or 1-800-685-2443.</p>

<h3><strong>Mission Statement</strong> </h3>
<p>The mission of the Pollution Prevention Assistance Division
(P&#178;AD) is to develop programs and activities to facilitate
reduction of pollution at the source, and instill a pollution
prevention ethic which is consistent with the protection of human
health and the environment. </p>
<hr>
<h3>History of P&#178;AD </h3>
<p>In the 1980's, the prevailing philosophy dictated that
hazardous waste be managed through treatment and disposal methods
using pollution control technology. Accordingly, the Georgia
Hazardous Waste Management Authority (Authority) proposed to
build a hazardous waste management facility, including an
incinerator, to manage the state's hazardous waste. </p>
<p>There was significant opposition to this plan. Therefore, in
1991, the Authority restructured and expanded its mission to
include the development of programs to facilitate the reduction
of hazardous waste at the source through various voluntary
measures. With these programs in place, the Authority
subsequently determined that a state-sponsored hazardous waste
management facility was not economically viable or needed in
Georgia at this time. As a result, it was decided that the
Authority go dormant and pollution prevention continue as a state
sponsored program. Every two years the Division is required by
law to determine whether Georgia produces enough hazardous waste
to warrant revisiting the need for a state sponsored facility. To
date, a need has not been established. </p>
<p>The Georgia Pollution Prevention Assistance Division was
created by the Georgia General Assembly as a non-regulatory
Division of the Department of Natural Resources to begin
operation October 1, 1993. The Division was designated by
Governor Miller as a &quot;One Stop Shop&quot; for Georgia
businesses interested in voluntarily finding ways to reduce their
generation of solid and hazardous waste; emissions; and releases
of pollutants into the air, water, and land. To accomplish this
goal, P&#178;AD has developed a variety of innovative <a
href="can_do.htm">technical assistance</a> programs including,
but not limited to, planning, information center, workshops,
on-site pollution prevention assessments, and training. These
activities are designed not only to provide technical assistance
to companies, but also to guide them in developing pollution
prevention programs tailored to their specific needs. </p>
<hr>
<h3>P&#178;AD Staff </h3>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD's staff consists of 15 full-time personnel and
three contract personnel who bring a broad range of experience
and expertise to P&#178;AD's activities and programs. Many of the
staff have worked for state and local government, industry,
private consultants, and environmental organizations. The staff
has expertise in management of solid and hazardous waste, water
quality, recycling, industrial processing and design,
manufacturing, energy, agriculture and public relations. They
include environmental, mechanical, chemical, and agricultural
engineers; chemists; biologists; a lawyer; a public relations
expert, and policy analysts. </p>
<hr>
<h3>Core Strategies</h3>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD offers a variety of <a href="programs.htm">programs</a>
to assist Georgia's citizens, businesses, government, and the
general public in improving by preventing waste. The Division's
clients generally fall within four groups: the manufacturing
sector, the commercial and institutional sector, the agricultural
sector, and the public sector. Five core strategies represent
basic approaches employed by P<sup>2</sup>AD in conducting its
daily operation and assistance activities. They range from
ensuring public and business input into Division programs to
promoting technology transfer through outreach. The basic core
strategies of P<sup>2</sup>AD include: </p>
<p><strong>Actively Seek Public Input</strong> </p>
<p>To instill the pollution prevention ethic and reduce pollution
at the source, P<sup>2</sup>AD must develop programs which are
embraced by the public and private sectors. This is accomplished
when the these sectors participate meaningfully in the formation
and implementation of pollution prevention policies and programs.
P<sup>2</sup>AD routinely uses four public involvement approaches
to gather input into its planning process. These techniques are:
surveys, focus groups, work groups, and public comment. </p>
<p><strong>Operate a Responsive Technical Assistance Program</strong> </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD's pollution prevention program seeks voluntary
participation from businesses and others that generate waste. The
technical assistance is non-regulatory and is provided at no
charge to the client. The main elements of the technical
assistance program include an information center, telephone
technical assistance, and on-site pollution prevention
assessments. </p>
<p><strong>Proactively Identify Organizations in Need of
Assistance</strong> </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD is responsive to requests for assistance by
all businesses and other organizations. However, this approach
will not ensure that needed information and support is requested
by the most significant waste generators. These groups may not be
aware of technical assistance provided by P<sup>2</sup>AD. To
reach this array of potential clients, P<sup>2</sup>AD identifies
technical assistance needs of generators whose waste may have an
adverse effect on the public health, the environment, or may
strain the existing environmental management infrastructure. P<sup>2</sup>AD
seeks voluntary participation in its non-regulatory pollution
prevention programs by motivating businesses through tangible
technical and financial incentives and recognition for continuous
improvements. </p>
<p><strong>Unlock the Pollution Prevention Potential of
Businesses and Others </strong></p>
<p>To ensure the continuous implementation of pollution
prevention, it is important that organizations consider pollution
prevention in their daily business planning. This means that the
budgeting, purchasing, and other financial decision makers must
consider the true costs of managing wastes in addition to other
environmental management decisions. P<sup>2</sup>AD offers a
variety of services to assist businesses in making sound
decisions based on a comprehensive evaluation of their
environmental management issues. Some of these services include
on-site facilitation, assistance in understanding true waste
management costs, environmental decision-making tools, and
recognition for internalizing the pollution prevention ethic. </p>
<p><strong>Maximize Use of Existing Resources</strong> </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD uses existing resources through innovative <a
href="partners.htm">public-private partnerships</a> with the
university system; federal, state, and local government agencies;
industry and trade associations; and non-profit organizations to
enhance the spread of pollution prevention throughout the state.
Two existing technical assistance partnerships are focused
primarily on addressing the pollution prevention needs of the
industrial and the agricultural sectors. Several research
partnerships with major industrial clients are underway to
provide process improvements for Georgia's carpet and paper
industries. </p>
<p>The Georgia Environmental Partnership (GEP) teams P<sup>2</sup>AD,
the Georgia Institute of Technology's Economic Development
Institute (EDI), and the University of Georgia's (UGA) Department
of Biological and Agricultural Engineering to coordinate the
delivery of environmental solutions to Georgia business through a
regionally-based technical assistance network. GEP also works
closely with the Southeastern Environmental Resources Alliance
(SERA) to facilitate the transfer of Department of Energy (DOE)
and Department of Defense (DOD) technologies to the private
sector for commercial application to pressing environmental
problems. </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD also teams again with the UGA's Department of
Biological and Agricultural Engineering and the Cooperative
Extension Service to promote pollution prevention practices to
agribusiness and the individual farmer using outreach,
environmental assessments through Farm*A*Syst, and applied
research. </p>
<p><strong>Promote Education and Information Exchange Through
Outreach</strong> </p>
<p>Outreach is regarded as a key strategy for making the public
and private sectors aware of pollution prevention issues and
informing them of the programs and assistance which is available
to them in addressing these issues. This typically involves
developing, distributing, and presenting information to local
extension services, Chambers of Commerce, or local governments;
publishing newsletters; developing waste reduction guidance
documents; and participating in public and industry sponsored
workshops and seminars. </p>
<p>From October 1, 1993 through September 30, 1996, P<sup>2</sup>AD
staff have responded to over 750 technical assistance requests,
made presentations at over 200 events, and expanded the mailing
list of the Division's quarterly newsletter, <a
href="newnews.htm"><em>From the Source</em></a>, to over 5,700
organizations and individuals. </p>

<h3>P<sup>2</sup>AD Partners with EDI </h3>
<p>As many of you know, P<sup>2</sup>AD is committed to
partnership as one way to help the Division reach the broadest
possible audience for our services in Georgia. We are pleased to
announce a new partnership with Georgia Tech's Economic
Development Institute (EDI). EDI is a technical assistance
organization with a mission of helping businesses and communities
in the areas of new enterprise development, management and
environmental assistance, and economic development. EDI provides
services through a network of eighteen regional offices
throughout Georgia. Offices are located in Dalton, Rome,
Gainesville, Cartersville, Carrollton, Athens, Augusta, Macon,
Warner Robins, Columbus, Dublin, Savannah, Albany, Douglas,
Brunswick, and several locations in metro Atlanta. Engineers in
many of EDI's field offices will receive pollution prevention
training from P<sup>2</sup>AD staff. We intend that this training
will result in a &quot;multiplier&quot; effect throughout the
state, with many more assistance providers raising awareness of
potential pollution prevention opportunities in industry. </p>
<p>We at P<sup>2</sup>AD are very excited about this partnership
for a number of reasons. First, this partnership, consistent with
the Division's guiding philosophies, leverages existing state
resources in order to better execute our mission. Whenever
possible, the Division seeks to use resources already in place,
rather than &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot;. Secondly, use of
EDI staff to help provide pollution prevention services is a good
example of the privatization approach to government. Instead of
building up a large state bureaucracy in Atlanta, P<sup>2</sup>AD
prefers to join with other organizations to deliver our programs.
Also, EDI is a group with strong local ties to Georgia
businesses, and EDI is known and trusted by the small business
community. Because of their relationship with Georgia business
and industry, EDI is a natural extension of the Division's
capability to reach small businesses, as well as the medium and
large sized firms in the state. Finally, EDI can provide to our
clients a broader range of environmental technical assistance,
including items (such as compliance assistance) that are outside
the legislative mandate of P<sup>2</sup>AD. We are looking
forward to a long and fruitful partnership with the Economic
Development Institute. </p>
<h3>Update on Other Partnerships </h3>
<p>In addition to our new association with Georgia Tech's EDI, we
also have several other currently active partnerships. The
Division's two Department of Energy National Industrial
Competitiveness through Energy, Environment, and Economics
(NICE3) projects in the carpet and pulp &amp; paper industries
involve a whole host of private and public partners in Georgia.
The carpet dyebath reuse project is now in its second year and
final technical tests prior to full in-plant demonstration are
now being conducted by Shaw Industries. Similarly, the lime mud
regeneration project being conducted by Altex Technologies began
pilot scale testing in June which will conclude later in the
summer. Successful completion of these projects and the resulting
technology transfer will allow P<sup>2</sup>AD to provide new
pollution prevention options for the textile and pulp &amp; paper
industries in Georgia. These projects are also demonstrating the
value of strong partnerships between the public and private
sectors in order to reach mutually desirable goals in waste
reduction. </p>
<p>On page 4 of this newsletter, you will read in detail about
another partnership in which P<sup>2</sup>AD has joined forces
with the University of Georgia's Agricultural Experiment Station
in Griffin. Funds from the Division helped the station establish
its <a href="garden.htm">Research and Education Garden</a>. The
Garden, in turn, also benefited from partnerships with various
local groups in Griffin. </p>
<p>Thanks to all of the organizations involved in the above
activities. P<sup>2</sup>AD looks forward to a long, productive
association with each of you! </p>
<h3>Pollution Prevention Software </h3>
<p>Thanks for your favorable response to our new pollution
prevention informational software. If you do not have a copy and
would like to obtain one, please give the office a call at (404)
651-5120 or 800-685-2443 or send us e-mail at <a
href="mailto:p2ad@ix.netcom.com">p2ad@ix.netcom.com</a>. Also, we
will be surveying some of you who received the software. If you
are contacted, please take a moment to help us evaluate the
effectiveness of the software disk.</p>

<h2 align="center">Fabricated Metal Products Sector Assessment
Near Completion Wood Products and Pulp &amp; Paper Now Available </h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by Mike Garruto, P.E., Pollution
Prevention Engineer</strong> </p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring/Summer 1996]</p>
<hr>
<p>The Winter 1996 issue of From the Source highlighted P<sup>2</sup>AD's
in-depth sector assessments of the wood products and pulp and
paper industries in Georgia. These reports are now available upon
request by calling Jancie Hatcher, P<sup>2</sup>AD's information
manager, at 404/651-5120 or 800/685-2443. Currently, the
fabricated metal products, printing industry, and rubber and
plastic products sector assessment reports are also nearing
completion. </p>
<p>As in the pulp and paper and wood products industries,
fabricated metal products (Standard Industrial Classification
3400 - 3499) companies are a significant contributor of toxic
emissions in Georgia. The sector report will identify common
processes that contribute to these wastestreams, successful
pollution prevention solutions undertaken in Georgia, technical
assistance resources that companies have used to help them
minimize waste, and impediments to pollution prevention. </p>
<p>According to the 1994 Georgia Manufacturing Directory, there
are over 800 fabricated metal products manufacturers with
approximately 28,000 employees in Georgia. Furthermore, the
economic and environmental impact on the state is even greater
when you consider that many companies in other SIC codes perform
metal fabrication tasks. Related sectors include the following: </p>
<p>SIC 2500, Furniture and Fixtures SIC 3500, Industrial and
Commercial Machinery and Computer Equipment SIC 3600, Electronic
and Other Electrical Equipment and Components SIC 3700,
Transportation Equipment SIC 3800, Measuring, Analyzing, and
Controlling Instruments SIC 3900, Miscellaneous Manufacturing
Industries </p>
<p>Within SIC 3400, Georgia companies fabricate metal cans and
containers, structural products, metal forgings and stampings,
hand tools, valves, and pipe among other items. Many also perform
coating, engraving, or allied services. The typical metal
fabrication plant is small with over 80% of the plants having 50
employees or less. Fabricated metal products plants are located
throughout the State with approximately one-third of the
companies located in the metropolitan Atlanta counties of Fulton,
DeKalb, Gwinnett, and Cobb. </p>
<p>In order to determine key issues within the sector, P<sup>2</sup>AD
researched existing pollution prevention literature and
compliance data. In addition, almost 10% of the fabricators were
surveyed in order to compare experiential data with the findings
outlined in relevant publications. From these sources, P<sup>2</sup>AD
was able to determine several key pollution prevention issues.
The following concerns were identified: </p>
<p>Waste generation from coatings application Waste generation
from surface preparation and cleaning Waste generation from metal
shaping processes Waste generation from metal plating operations
Lack of technical resources at facilities </p>
<p>For the first four issues, P<sup>2</sup>AD was able to
identify the types of waste generated, characteristics of the
processes generating these wastes, proven pollution prevention
options, and examples of companies in Georgia that have
successfully implemented at least one of the options. </p>
<p>Our research also indicated that companies with over 60
employees are two to three times more likely than others to have
undertaken certain pollution prevention measures including the
following: </p>
<p>Spill and leak prevention programs Process equipment changes
Process optimization Alternative product designs </p>
<p>In addition, small metal fabricators are less likely to
generate hazardous waste as many of them perform only assembly or
metal shaping functions and may not have painting or cleaning and
degreasing operations. This data is valuable to P<sup>2</sup>AD
in our efforts to ensure that our technical assistance is
structured to meet the needs of our clientele. </p>
<p>The paper concludes with a list of manufacturers' technical
and organizational needs that may prevent them from implementing
successful pollution prevention programs and initiatives.
Suggestions are made to effectively address these barriers to
pollution prevention. Like the wood products and pulp and paper
reports, the metal fabrication sector document will be reviewed
internally and by industry peers. It is anticipated that the
report will be available to the public this summer through P<sup>2</sup>AD's
information center. </p>

<h2 align="center">Southwire Holds Second Annual Pollution
Prevention Awards &amp; Workshop </h2>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring/Summer 1996]</p>
<hr>
<p>On Thursday, April 18th, Southwire Company held a pollution
prevention workshop and awards day to help increase the awareness
of pollution prevention and recognize employee efforts during the
past year. &quot;Our Pollution Prevention effort is critical to
expanding our business domestically and globally. We are
committed to a strategy of eliminating pollution and waste from
our manufacturing operations,&quot; said Win Hill, Director
Corporate Environmental Management. &quot;Each year we meet to
share our successes and recognize those who demonstrate
excellence in this effort.&quot; </p>
<p>The morning session was highlighted by presentations from
Steve Avary of Zep Manufacturing, and Tony Knick and Frank
Hollowell of Synthetic Industries, who shared their pollution
prevention / waste minimization success stories. Other
presentation topics were about waste cost accounting and ISO
14000 international environmental management standards. In the
afternoon, six Southwire facilities discussed their pollution
prevention implementation processes and results achieved to date.
Southwire established a corporate waste minimization / pollution
prevention program in 1994. The Southwire facilities then
implemented the program through the use of employee Corrective
Action Teams (CAT). For 1995, 15 Southwire facilities submitted
waste minimization reports to be evaluated for the awards day.
Criteria used to judge the reports included evidence of employee
involvement, wastestream assessment, evaluation of pollution
prevention options, technology transfer, and measurable results. </p>
<p>The six facilities selected as finalists were: Carrollton
Utility Products Plant and Carrollton Building Wire Plant,
Carrollton, Georgia; NSA, Hawesville, Kentucky; Southwire Company
Starkville Plant, Starkville, Mississippi; Southwire Specialty
Products, Osceola, Arkansas; and Southwire Machinery Division,
Carrollton, Georgia. After the six facility presentations,
Southwire presented 1995 CEO awards for pollution prevention.
Carrollton Building Wire Plant and NSA were selected for
Achievement Awards. The Excellence Award went to the Southwire
Machinery Division for their outstanding achievement in pollution
prevention. </p>
<p>Seventy Southwire managers representing all U.S. manufacturing
operations attended. Representatives from the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and the Georgia Environmental Protection
Division (EPD) were also in attendance. &quot;Today shows how
important recognition and awards are to inspiring employees to do
their best,&quot; said Bob Kerr, P<sup>2</sup>AD Director.
&quot;The effort extended by the Southwire plants and the results
obtained far exceeded the value of the awards. Congratulations to
all the participants for their outstanding efforts.&quot; </p>

<h2 align="center">Georgia Station Research and Education Garden
- Interpreting &quot;Green&quot; Research for the Horticultural
Industry and the Public </h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by S. Kristine Braman Associate
Professor Department of Entomology University of Georgia </strong></p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring/Summer 1996]</p>
<hr>
<p>The Georgia Station Research and Education Garden is part of
the Georgia Experiment Station. The Experiment Station has for a
century been one of the premier agricultural research centers in
the South. As one of three main campuses of the University of
Georgia Agricultural Experiment Station system (locations in
Athens, Griffin, and Tifton), it has made notable contributions
both to the applied and basic sciences. The station has ongoing
programs in agricultural economics, biological and agricultural
engineering, crop and soil sciences, entomology, horticulture,
plant pathology, and food science and technology. </p>
<p>The Garden is being developed to provide a forum for the
education of several audiences about the impact of ongoing
research programs of the University's College of Agricultural and
Environmental Sciences. The research and educational programs in
the Garden will be developed with input from the horticultural
industry and directed towards industry, gardener, professional
educator, and homeowner needs with emphasis on the interpretation
of ongoing research. The Garden consists of a gently rolling,
65-acre tract, located off Ellis Road in Griffin, Georgia, 40
miles south of Atlanta. The Garden site has excellent public
visibility and is easily accessible to clientele in central and
north Georgia. </p>
<p>The Concept Plan for the Garden retains the natural topography
as well as most of the existing vegetation. A 15-year old
Virginia pine seed orchard will be retained. The main entrance to
the Garden has been placed on Ellis Road (see map). Historical
trees from the Heritage Collection will line the drive and
research plots for pest management in hollies, turf, and
wildflowers along with various wildflower mixes will be visible.
A collection of native azalea species and other plant materials
in the ornamental plant breeding program can be viewed from the
drive. </p>
<p>Landscape management plots designed to reduce risks from urban
pesticide use have been included in the shaded plots.
Installation and management of these plots have been supported by
the Pollution Prevention Assistance Division of the Department of
Natural Resources. This project evolved from ongoing research
assessing the range of pest resistance in woody ornamentals and
turfgrasses and the effect of cultural conditions on insect pest
problems. This project includes the use of pest-resistant or
pest-susceptible plant materials grown with very limited use of
pesticides as compared to the use of pest-susceptible plant
materials grown under traditional chemical pest management. We
are also currently evaluating the influence of sun vs. shade as a
landscape management variable on plant quality and pest
susceptibility under reduced input management. Future studies in
this 10-year project will include the impact of other landscape
management practices, such as mulch, irrigation, and
fertilization on pest management. </p>
<p>At the highest point in the Garden, a visitors center with
meeting facilities for 150 people is planned. A wide variety of
educational opportunities will be accommodated in this facility
including meetings hosted by members of related professional
associations. A greenhouse range will enhance research and
educational opportunities offered in the Garden. The greenhouse
range will include the following: a polyethylene-covered house
comparable to those used by Georgia growers; a subdivided house
for pollution prevention research with runoff collection
facilities for each subunit; and an automated, subdivided house
for biological control research. </p>
<p>Demonstration plots will be planted near the visitors center.
Some of these will be former research plots dedicated to
demonstration of research results; others will be cultivar
collections (iris, daylily) or theme gardens (butterfly garden,
medicinal plant) prepared and maintained by volunteers from local
plant societies or Master Gardeners. A demonstration of lawn turf
cultivars will also be included. The Historic Garden, containing
a demonstration of new cultivar releases from the Georgia
Agricultural Experiment Stations, will be easily accessible from
the visitors center. </p>
<p>The Research and Education Garden is a good example of a
partnership among a variety of public and private groups. The
Georgia Station was able to take existing state and university
resources, and then leverage these resources to enable a number
of outstanding contributions from the private sector. </p>
<p>As mentioned above, initial funds from P<sup>2</sup>AD
supported initial research efforts and garden development.
Several Georgia trade associations then made substantial
contributions to the Garden. The Georgia Commercial Flower
Growers Association has assisted in development and purchase of
the first greenhouse for the Garden. The Georgia Irrigation
Association designed an irrigation plan for the demonstration
area and will provide materials for installation of the
irrigation mechanism. The Georgia Turfgrass Association and the
Georgia Sod Producers Association have donated sod for erosion
control research on the banks of the irrigation pond in the
Garden. Wholesale members of the Georgia Green Industry
Association have donated approximately 150 trees for planting in
the Garden, and Snapper, Inc. Of McDonough has provided about a
dozen pieces of lawn maintenance equipment. </p>
<p>Additionally, local contributions to the Garden have enabled
some exciting additions to the Garden. The Flint River Iris
Society is donating and installing the iris plants for the
demonstration plots, as well as making a monetary donation.
Similarly, the Flint River Daylily Society is donating and
installing day lilies for the Garden. Monetary donations have
also been received from the United Bank in Griffin, the Griffin
Federation of Garden Clubs, and the Redbud District Garden Clubs.
The detailed landscape design for the demonstration area was
donated by Master Gardeners Davie Biagi and Carolyn Fjeran.
Together, all of the contributors have provided a dynamic start
for the development of the Garden. </p>

<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring/Summer 1996]</p>
<hr>
<p>If you are a non-governmental professional working in the
field of pollution prevention, the National Pollution Prevention
Roundtable wants to include you as a contact in a new directory.
The directory, called P<sup>2</sup> Experts, will provide a quick
and easy way to locate individuals with specific P<sup>2</sup>
expertise, industrial experience, or process knowledge. It will
also provide an opportunity for individuals to promote their P<sup>2</sup>
skills, cultivate business connections, and establish government
contacts. </p>
<p>Sponsored by the Roundtable, P<sup>2</sup> Experts is being
developed under a grant from the U.S. EPA and being managed by
the Northeast Waste Management Officials' Association (NEWMOA).
Except for the time it takes to fill out a questionnaire, P<sup>2</sup>
Experts costs nothing to join. If you want to participate,

<h2 align="center">Industry Recognition Program to Launch in
September </h2>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring/Summer 1996]</p>
<hr>
<p>P&#178;AD's <a href="p3intro.htm">Pollution Prevention
Partners (P&#179;) program</a> is expected to begin taking
applications from Georgia industry in September. The program is a
three level certification program that recognizes and rewards
continuous pollution prevention performance and improvement by
Georgia industries. Companies that qualify for the P&#179;
program demonstrate to their customers, employees, and community
a commitment to preventing pollution and waste, increasing
efficiency, and improving the environment. </p>
<p>&quot;We view the recognition program as an excellent
incentive for companies to reduce all of their waste
streams,&quot; said Harold Reheis, director of the Georgia
Environmental Protection Division. </p>
<p>&quot;The P&#179; program will recognize companies that are
doing a good job in reducing waste and encourage other companies
to start a pollution prevention program,&quot; said G. Robert
Kerr, director of the Pollution Prevention Assistance Division. </p>
<p>Companies that qualify for the P&#179; program and eligible
for public recognition and other incentives. Among the proposed
incentives is a reduction in certain fees paid to the Georgia
Environmental Protection Division. The fee portion of the program
must be approved by the Governor and General Assembly in 1997. As
companies improve their pollution prevention performance, the
level of recognition and value of the incentives increase.
Companies may qualify for three levels of recognition -- Entry,
Achievement and Model. </p>
<p>The <a href="entintro.htm">Entry Level</a> recognizes
facilities or plants that demonstrate a commitment to developing
a successful pollution prevention program. To qualify, facilities
must develop a pollution prevention plan with numeric reduction
goals. Facilities that qualify for the Entry Level are eligible
for recognition in P&#178;AD publications and will receive a
certificate. Entry Level Partners may apply for advancement to
the Achievement Level after one year. </p>
<p>The <a href="achintro.htm">Achievement Level</a> recognizes
facilities or plants that have established a pollution prevention
program and are making progress toward meeting reduction goals.
Facilities that qualify for and maintain the Achievement Level
will receive public recognition and up to a 10% reduction in
hazardous waste trust fund and Toxic Release Inventory fees paid
to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) for one
year. Facilities that continue to show progress toward meeting
pollution prevention goals may receive up to a 10% reduction in
fees in each of two additional years. The savings from these fees
must be allocated to pollution prevention activities at the
facility </p>
<p>The <a href="modintro.htm">Model Level</a> recognizes
facilities or plants that are industry leaders in pollution
prevention. Model Level facilities incorporate pollution
prevention into daily business activities, and have made
substantial progress toward meeting pollution prevention
reduction goals. Facilities that qualify for and maintain the
Model Level will receive public recognition and up to a 25%
reduction in hazardous waste trust fund and Toxic Release
Inventory fees paid to EPD for one year. Facilities that continue
to show progress toward meeting pollution prevention goals may
receive up to a 25% reduction in fees in each of two additional
years. The savings from the fees must be allocated to pollution
prevention activities at the facility. </p>
<p>The program will undergo a public comment period from June 15
to July 15. Applications will be available through P&#178;AD on
September 15. </p>

<h2 align="center">Neighborhood Environmental Partnership </h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by Susan Varlamoff, Outreach
Coordinator</strong> </p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring/Summer 1996]</p>
<hr>
<p>In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed an executive order
titled &quot;Federal Actions to Address Environmental justice in
Minority Populations and Low-income Populations&quot;. According
to Robert Bullard of Clark Atlanta University, an expert in the
field of environmental justice, one effective way to improve the
health and safety of neighbors living in industrialized areas is
through an industry commitment to pollution prevention. In
Georgia, the City of Atlanta, Clark Atlanta University, and the
Pollution Prevention Assistance Division (P<sup>2</sup>AD) have
teamed up to develop and implement the Neighborhood Environmental
Partnership to improve the quality of life in low income minority
neighborhoods in industrialized areas of Atlanta. </p>
<p>Through this partnership, a pilot study will be established in
Atlanta to encourage local industries to implement pollution
prevention into their operations and to provide a vehicle for
community outreach. This will be accomplished by contacting
company managers through the mail and by phone to inform them
about the project. Workshops will be held for interested
businesses on pollution prevention and outreach techniques.
Likewise the communities within the pilot area will be contacted
to participate in the outreach component of the study. </p>
<p>This concept is not new. For example, the chemical industry
has learned that a poor public image can negatively impact
business. As a result, the Responsible Care program was
instituted by the Chemical Manufacturers Association to address
environmental concerns. The program has six codes which a company
must fulfill in order to participate in the Association.
Pollution prevention and community awareness are two of the six
codes. This program has significantly improved the image of
chemical manufacturers. The textile industry has developed a
similar program. Closer to home, P<sup>2</sup>AD has incorporated
community outreach into its three level certification program
which recognizes companies for pollution prevention initiatives.
In order to achieve the highest level, a company must do
community outreach. More and more companies are opting to
&quot;go green&quot; because it improves their image, the bottom
line, and the surrounding environment. </p>
<p>For more information about the Neighborhood Environmental
Partnership, please contact Susan Varlamoff at (404) 657-5208, or
Marilyn Johnson, City of Atlanta, at (404) 330-6755.</p>

<hr>
<p>This issue of Pollution Solutions is focused on household
hazardous waste. The City of Alpharetta began accepting
batteries, lamps, and ballasts from residents in January 1996. To
date, the Alpharetta 2-4-8 Household Hazardous Waste Collection
and Recycling program has collected 3,564 household batteries, 47
fluorescent tubes, and 7 ballasts from over 200 people. The
average person drops off 21 batteries. One participant drove over
40 miles one-way to drop off batteries. The next step is to move
towards a daily collection so that the program can better respond
to the citizen's needs. </p>
<p>The collection is open one Saturday a month for the citizens
of Alpharetta. Residents outside the city may bring their items
to the collection for a small fee. For more information, please
contact Dee West at (770) 410-5835. </p>

<p><a name="Introduction "><strong>Introduction</strong> </a></p>
<p>The purpose of this report is to identify the specific causes
of waste generation, and cost-effective solutions that will
reduce waste in the pulp and paper industry in Georgia. The
benefits of reducing waste are reduced pollution and decreased
operating cost to the business. Releases of high-priority toxic
chemicals are the primary focus of this report but other
significant solid and liquid wastes will be included. Barriers
exist that limit the implementation of pollution prevention
projects and technologies. Barriers and strategies to overcome
them will also be discussed in this report. </p>
<p><a name="Methodology"><strong>Methodology</strong></a> </p>
<p>Review of trade and environmental publications indicated that
the processes responsible for Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)
releases in this sector are primarily Kraft pulping and bleaching
of pulp. Businesses that use these processes were identified by
reviewing 1993 TRI reports and the Georgia Manufacturing
Directory. There are relatively few pulp and paper mills in
Georgia. Telephone interviews were conducted of Kraft pulp mills
and paper mills in the state. Visits were made to six mills;
various processes related to Kraft pulping, bleaching, and
recycling were reviewed. The interviews and plant visits were
conducted to collect information on the various types of
equipment and chemistries used in the mills. Water usage, pulp
production, and information on various other wastes were
collected. Mill environmental and production staffs were also
questioned about programs at their facilities to reduce waste and
evaluate new technologies available to the pulp and paper
industry. The results of this study are presented in this
document. </p>
<p><a name="Summary"><strong>Summary</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The following key issues were identified as a result of this
study through contacts with Georgia pulp mill personnel, mill
tours, interviews with paper industry experts, and review of
various trade and environmental publications. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Lack of Facility Pollution Prevention Programs </li>
    <li>Water Use Reduction and Reuse </li>
    <li>Lime Mud Waste Reduction </li>
    <li>Energy Conservation and Recovery </li>
    <li>Alternatives to Chlorine Bleaching </li>
    <li>Log Yard Waste Reduction</li>
</ul>
<p>The Georgia Pollution Prevention Assistance Division (P<sup>2</sup>AD)
will assist Georgia pulp and paper manufacturers in addressing
these key issues by developing various programs. P<sup>2</sup>AD
will work with existing technical and business organizations to
provide training, publication of fact sheets and case studies,
and conduct applied research demonstration projects in order to
address critical pollution prevention issues. </p>

<h3><a name="Profile"><strong>Profile of the Pulp and Paper
Manufacturing Sector in Georgia</strong></a> </h3>
<p>Georgia pulp manufacturers produce pulp, bleached pulp, or
specialty pulp for the food and pharmaceutical industry. Many of
these companies also produce finished paper, paperboard, or
linerboard. Twenty-four companies are listed in the Georgia
Manufacturers Directory within SIC code 26 that are predominately
involved in cellulose pulp manufacturing. Approximately 13,000
people work for these manufacturers. A list of these businesses
is provided below in Table 1 with a description of the primary
products and number of employees. </p>

</table>
<p>Of the 24 manufacturers in Georgia, thirteen are large
manufacturers of pulp only, pulp and paper, or pulp and
linerboard. These manufacturers produce virgin pulp and form a
finished paper product. The pulp may be either bleached or
unbleached. Four Georgia mills produce bleached virgin pulp. Pulp
is also sold to paper manufacturers that make paper, filter
paper, or other specialty paper from pulp. There are
approximately 100 companies in Georgia that are primarily paper,
paperboard, or paper products manufacturers that do not
manufacture pulp. These companies are not the focus of this
study. </p>
<p>Another manufacturing group repulps old corrugated cardboard,
linerboard, newsprint, and other waste paper. There are at least
nine mills producing recycled pulp in Georgia. Recycling mills
manufacture pulp for sale to other industries or manufacture a
finished paper product. Some recycling mills deink printed stock
using floatation or continuous deinking. Bleaching is done
primarily with peroxide and less with sodium hypochlorite by
recyclers. At least one company recycles newsprint and other
paper in a dry repulping process to make insulation, animal
bedding, and reseeding material used on highway right of ways. </p>
<p>Paper mills need a source of water and a receiving body to
dispose of wastewater. Paper mills are generally located near a
river to provide a means of disposal for the often tremendous
wastewater stream generated by the mill. A secondary reason is to
provide water for mill usage since a number of mills use wells as
the primary source of mill supply water. Cooling water is also
needed and is usually supplied from surface water. All Georgia
mills have wastewater treatment plants except some of the small
specialty product mills, and dispose of wastewater directly to a
river after treatment. At least one mill disposes of wastewater
to a municipal treatment system. Several mills also purchase
water from a city or other source of treated water. </p>

<h3><a name="Processes"><strong>Pulp and Paper Industrial
Processes</strong></a><strong> </strong></h3>
<p>In order to understand the pulp and paper industry, a general
description of the pulping and paper making process is needed.
Each of the companies uses some or all of these processes. </p>
<p><strong>Wood Yard Operations</strong> </p>
<p>Wood is delivered to a pulp mill either as logs or chips. Logs
are delivered with the bark attached to prevent loss of moisture
and other degradation. Logs are handled in the yard by cranes or
log trucks. They are loaded onto a conveyor or log flume where
they are carried to a debarker and chipper. Chips are screened to
remove over and undersized chips, and then stored in the yard
awaiting digestion. The majority of the Georgia virgin pulp mills
have wood yards. A growing trend is to eliminate wood yards and
receive chipped wood only. Several mills receive only wood chips
or are planning wood yard closure in the near future. </p>
<p><strong>Water Treatment </strong></p>
<p>Pulp mills generally require a large amount of water in
processing to remove lignin and bleaching byproducts. Water is
generally obtained from rivers or wells. From 5,000 to 40,000
gallons of water is required to produce one ton of dry pulp in
Georgia's virgin pulp mills. This water is treated prior to use
to remove suspended solids and other contaminants. </p>
<p><strong>Digestion </strong></p>
<p>Chips are heated by steam and white liquor is added. The
liquor impregnated chips then enter the digester where they are
heated to cooking temperature. Spent cooking liquor or black
liquor is removed from the brownstock after cooking. In batch
digesters, the brownstock is blown from the bottom of the
digester vessel prior to washing. In a continuous digester,
washing takes place inside the digester to remove liquor and cool
the pulp. In either case, brownstock is washed to remove the
majority of spent liquor. It is also screened to remove
undigested knots. The majority of the 13 pulp mills use the Kraft
process. One mill uses the thermo-mechanical pulping process. </p>
<p><strong>Washing</strong> </p>
<p>Pulp washing takes place after each major process. The purpose
of washing is to remove undesirable elements from the pulp
stream. Black liquor, fines, lignin, and bleach byproducts are
removed after each processing step. Washer efficiency can be
measured by the cleanliness of the pulp and the amount of water
used to achieve that level of cleanliness. There are a number of
different types of washers available. Vacuum drum brownstock
washers (six-stage or three-stage) were the industry standards up
to the 1970s. At least six Georgia mills currently use vacuum
drum washers. Pressure brownstock washers represent a later
washing technology with at least one mill using this technology.
Diffusion brownstock washers are currently the industry
standards, but diffusion washers are also being improved upon.
Diffusion washers are used by at least three mills. At least two
pulp mills in Georgia use Chemi washers, which are the most
efficient washers available currently. Each improvement
represents cleaner pulp with a water usage reduction. </p>
<p><strong>Refining</strong> </p>
<p>Pulp passes through slots in rotating plates to separate the
cellulose clumps into fibers and condition the fibers for paper
making. Essentially, the fibers are cut to a uniform length
during refining which reduces strength. The fibers are also
conditioned by refining which improves bonding and strength of
the finished paper product. </p>
<p><strong>Oxygen Delignification</strong> </p>
<p>Some mills have installed an oxygen stage to further remove
lignin from the brownstock as a prebleaching step. Reduced lignin
content produces a whiter pulp. Oxygen and white liquor are added
to the brownstock in a heated reactor where additional
delignification takes place. Lignin compounds freed as a result
of oxygen delignification are removed in washing and extraction
stages. At least two Georgia mills use oxygen delignification.
Oxygen delignification reduces the amount of chlorine or other
bleaching chemicals required to whiten the pulp in the bleach
stage. </p>
<p><strong>Extended Delignification </strong></p>
<p>Various extended delignification techniques are used to remove
more lignin prior to bleaching. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and heat
act to break complex bonds in the lignin to make them soluble in
water or volatile. NaOH and heat also break bonds in the
cellulose reducing strength and yield. Extended delignification
techniques cook the wood chips at lower temperature for longer
periods of time to remove lignin with reduced damage to the
cellulose. Several techniques are in use to control temperature
and liquor chemistry in the digester. At least four mills in
Georgia use extended delignification. Extended delignification
reduces the amount of bleaching chemicals required in the
bleaching stage to produce the same pulp whiteness. </p>
<p><strong>Bleaching </strong></p>
<p>Bleaching usually takes place in a multistage process. The
purpose of bleaching is to remove lignin without damaging the
cellulose. One process is the DED process; D represents chlorine
dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>) and E represents extraction. In this
process, brownstock is mixed with ClO<sub>2</sub> in the D1
reactor which further reacts with lignin in the pulp. Washing
follows to remove the chlorinated lignin compounds from the pulp.
NaOH is added to the pulp stream in the E tower and is followed
by washing in a press. Extraction neutralizes the pulp and
improves subsequent washing. The D2 tower is the last stage of
bleaching where ClO<sub>2</sub> provides the final whitening of
the pulp. If preceded by oxygen delignification, the process is
abbreviated ODED. Chlorine (C), peroxide (P), oxygen (O), sodium
hypochlorite (H), and ozone (Z) are other chemicals that can be
used in various configurations. For example, ODEoD would consist
of: </p>
<p align="center"><em>oxygen reactor &gt; ClO</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em>
reactor &gt; extraction with oxygen added (EO) &gt; ClO</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em>
reactor</em> </p>
<p>The final stage of bleaching is often used to whiten or
lighten remaining lignin. Eight Georgia mills bleach pulp in some
manner, four of which are virgin pulp mills. </p>
<p><strong>Paper Making</strong> </p>
<p>The pulp is then transported to the paper machine where a pulp
mat is formed on a screen. Water is removed from the sheet by a
combination of vacuum, heat, and pressure applied through
rollers. The finished paper can be made in a variety of weights
and is rolled onto large rollers for shipment to other processing
plants. Paper is sometimes coated on the paper machine with
kaolin to provide a white surface or has a binder added to
increase wet strength. Some binders contain formaldehyde; many
companies have replaced these with nonformaldehyde binders. Other
coatings and binders contain ammonia or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA).
Approximately 17 mills in Georgia produce paper, paperboard, or
similar products. </p>
<p><strong>Power Boiler </strong></p>
<p>Energy in the form of heat and steam is generated by burning
waste wood from the log yard or fossil fuels. In addition to
steam, electricity is also often generated on-site at pulp mills.
Pulp and paper mills require a large amount of energy to operate. </p>
<p><strong>Liquor Recovery Cycle</strong> </p>
<p>NaOH and sodium sulfide (Na<sub>2</sub>S) are the primary
pulping chemicals. NaOH reacts with lignin in the wood to release
the cellulose fiber. Na<sub>2</sub>S buffers the reaction to keep
the solution caustic, and aids in the removal of digested lignin
by increasing its solubility. Spent cooking liquor, or black
liquor contains various organic and sulfur compounds in addition
to the reactive pulping components of NaOH and Na<sub>2</sub>S.
The black liquor is removed from the pulp at various locations
after the delignification process and concentrated in an
evaporator. The concentrated liquor, or strong black liquor is
combusted in a furnace along with sodium sulfate (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)
to recover Na<sub>2</sub>S, and sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>)
in the form of ash. This ash is mixed with water and lime (CaO).
The resultant reaction forms green liquor and replenishes the
original pulping chemicals NaOH and Na<sub>2</sub>S; calcium
carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>). CaCO<sub>3</sub> is precipitated
from the green liquor in a clarifier and converted back to CaO in
a lime kiln. After removal of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, the green liquor
becomes white liquor. The recovery cycle consists of a liquor
evaporator, recovery boiler, clarifier, and lime kiln. </p>
<p><strong>Wastewater Treatment</strong> </p>
<p>Wastewater gathered from various mill processes is treated
prior to discharge to reduce biological oxygen demand (BOD),
chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total suspended solids (TSS).
Wastewater typically passes through a primary clarifier to remove
the bulk of the cellulose fibers lost during processing and other
solids. Wastewater then passes through aeration ponds to further
reduce BOD and COD. Nutrients in the form of ammonium nitrate or
ammonia are often added to encourage microbe activity. Wastewater
is then discharged directly to a river or tidal river. Wastewater
volumes are very large ranging up to 40,000,000 gallons per day
with relatively low contaminant concentrations. In addition to
BOD, COD, and TSS, color and chlorinated compounds such as dioxin
have been of great concern to pulp mills. Aeration and
clarification do not significantly reduce color or chlorinated
compounds. </p>
<p><strong>Waste Paper Recycling</strong> </p>
<p>Another segment of the industry repulps cardboard or newsprint
into recycled paper or paperboard. Recycled material is repulped
by adding water, sodium hydroxide, and heat. The pulp is then
made into a finished paper product on a paper machine in the same
manner as a virgin paper mill. Deinking and bleaching are also
done at some recycle mills. Floatation is one common method of
deinking. Peroxide is commonly used in the bleaching process.
Approximately nine Georgia mills are involved in repulping waste
paper products. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Characteristics">Waste Stream and Generation
Characteristics of Georgia Pulp and Paper Manufacturers</a> </h3>
<p>Wastes are generated by the industrial processes used by
Georgia pulp and paper manufacturers. Almost all of the wastes
generated are derived from unusable portions of the tree such as
bark and lignin. Additional wastes are generated from power
generation or from the chemicals used in pulping, bleaching, and
chemical recovery. Energy is also a waste stream. Water entering
the mill is heated for process use. Thermal energy is emitted to
the environment from numerous sources. </p>
<p>The usable portion of a tree is cellulose from which paper is
made. Other materials such as turpentine are byproducts which
have a market value. Most other components are released to the
environment as solid waste, liquids, gasses, or energy derived
from combustion. </p>
<p><strong>Toxic Wastes</strong> </p>
<p>Toxic wastes reported on the 1993 TRI totaled more than 18.8
million pounds of which 16.4 million pounds were released to the
air. TRI releases for 1993 are shown in Figure 2. Of the 26
chemicals reported, methanol was released in the largest quantity
at approximately 9.3 million pounds. Methanol is generated from
pulping at the rate of 12 to 20 pounds per ton of production in
the Kraft process. Bleaching can increase that amount up to 25
pounds. Thermo-mechanical pulping also releases methanol, but in
much lower quantities at about 0.5 pounds per ton of pulp.
Methanol and other organics (MEK, acetone, etc.) are released
primarily from process vents, but are also found in wastewater
and the recovery furnace stack. Wastewater leaving the mill can
contain large amounts of the methanal; biological destruction of
methanol is estimated to be in excess of 99% in wastewater
treatment plants. Non-contact recovery boilers available since
the 1970s reduce methanol stack releases to near zero. Newer and
modernized facilities collect and combust process vent gasses in
the recovery boiler, lime kiln, or power boiler furnaces reducing
methanol and sulfur releases. Older facilities still have
uncontrolled process vents releasing significant amounts of
methanol. </p>
<p>Noncondensable gasses are usually burned in the lime kiln or
recovery boiler. Mills have traditionally avoided burning
noncondensable gasses in the recovery boiler due to an increased
risk of an explosion. Some mills have lime kilns which cannot
meet the capacity required to burn all noncondensable gasses, or
have significant downtime due to mechanical failures. The result
is increased emissions of sulfur and organics when the kilns are
used to combust noncondensable gasses. Burning noncondensable
gasses in the kiln also decreases the lime recovery capacity,
thus increasing solid waste in the form of disposed lime mud. A
few mills have begun to burn noncondensable gasses in recovery
furnaces to take advantage of their greater capacity. </p>
<p>Sulfuric and hydrochloric acids are also released by pulp
mills. These materials are combustion byproducts from coal-fired
boiler operations. Sulfuric acid is also used in paper making and
other mill processes to adjust pH. Zinc is another material
reported that is nonpulp related. Zinc is contained in ash from
burning tires as a boiler fuel. Tire burning for energy recovery
is a popular tire recycling or disposal method. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>FIGURE 2 - 1993 GEORGIA TRI RELEASES BY
PULP AND PAPER MANUFACTURERS IN POUNDS</strong></p>
<p align="center"><img src="pulp1.gif" width="447" height="280"></p>
<p>Chlorinated compounds such as chloroform are emitted from
wastewater and bleach plant process vents. Chloroform is
primarily associated with the use of sodium hypochlorite and
chlorine bleaching. Mills generally have replaced both of these
materials to some degree. Hypochlorite use is discontinuing.
Chlorine is being replaced either partially or fully by chlorine
dioxide. Ozone is also used in place of chlorine on a limited
basis in other states. For these reasons, chloroform emissions
have decreased. Dioxin is another chlorine related pollutant.
Dioxin levels in effluent from mills that have switched to 100%
chlorine dioxide are usually below detectable levels. Chlorine
dioxide has replaced chlorine completely, 100% substitution, in
three Georgia mills. Several other mills have replaced 20% to 30%
of the chlorine used for bleaching with chlorine dioxide. </p>
<p>Chromium and dichloromethane are two chemicals reported from
Georgia mills on the 1993 TRI. These are nonpulp related and are
due to specific situations that occurred at particular mills. </p>
<p><strong>Solid Waste</strong> </p>
<p>Solid waste generation by pulp and paper manufacturers varies
between 0.01 and 0.26 tons of waste per ton of product (TPT). The
wide diversity is due to several factors. Lime mud and wood yard
debris can be large solid waste streams. The sources of these
wastes are log handling and insufficient capacity lime kilns.
Some mills have sufficient lime kiln capacity and thus produce
small amounts of waste. Other mills have reduced wood yard waste
by purchasing wood chips and eliminating log storage. Other solid
wastes typical in pulp mills are wastewater treatment sludge and
digester knots. Sludge and knots are reused in some mills and
disposed of in others. </p>
<p>Solid waste is usually disposed of in on-site landfills; some
mills use municipal or private landfills. Disposal costs are
often very high, exceeding $2 million annually in some mills
whether on-site or off-site. Some municipal landfills used by
pulp mills have closed. As on-site landfills reach capacity,
several mills are considering building new landfills. New
landfills can cost $10 to $20 million to open and are not an
attractive option to most pulp mills. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Wood Yard Waste </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Wood yard waste generation by Georgia pulp and paper
manufacturers varies between 0.02 and 0.06 TPT. Oversized logs,
wood debris, decayed wood, sand, soil, and bark are typical
wastes. Wood waste can be burned in power boilers if soil and
sand are removed. Much of this material is landfilled, or used in
the landfill as cover material. Wood chips that are burned for
energy are still considered waste by most mills if originally
intended for pulping. Several mills indicated that wood yard
waste was the largest solid waste stream from their facilities. </p>
<p>Chip making also generates some wood waste. Knots and
undersized chips are removed from the chip screen. These
materials, along with bark, are usually used as fuel. Clean,
palm-sized bark chunks have a high market value as a landscaping
material. Some mills sell bark for landscaping. Sawmills and
other bark sources that traditionally sold this material to pulp
mills for fuel have diverted the landscaping suitable bark to
other markets. The smaller, dirtier bark is sold to mills for
fuel use. Soil and other debris in this bark must be removed
prior to burning or after as increased ash volume, thus creating
additional waste. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sludge </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Various mill sludges are also disposed of as solid waste but
are derived from wastewater treatment systems. Primary and
secondary clarifier sludges consist of dirt, debris, and
cellulose. This material is intentionally rejected due to being
out of specification or accidentally due to inherent
inefficiencies in the pulp washing systems. At each washing or
refining stage, some usable pulp is lost even after passing
though save-alls. Deinking sludges are generated from recycling
plants and consist of inks, clays, soils, and some cellulose
fiber. Mills sometimes dry and burn the sludges for energy
recovery and volume reduction. Deinking sludge will have
approximately 50% of the energy value of bark. Sludges are
sometimes applied to forest or farm land partially as a disposal
method and partially to recover nutrients. Sludge generation is
reported to be 0.02 to 0.06 TPT. Some pulp mills indicated that
improvements have been made in reducing the amount of cellulose
inadvertently sent to wastewater treatment. As the cellulose
content in sludge is reduced, sludge volume decreases. The sludge
generated is then less useful for traditional recycling options
such as reuse in ceiling tile manufacture or as fuel. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ash</strong><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>Ash is generated due to combustion. Coal, bark, wood, tires,
and sludge are burned producing varying amounts of ash due in
part to the amount of noncombustibles in the materials. Ash is
disposed of in landfills or has some limited reuse. Wood and bark
ash are sometimes used agriculturally for their liming potential.
Ash generation rates are approximately 0.04 TPT from Georgia pulp
mills. Ashes from different fuels will have varying metal
content. Ash from burning tires will contain zinc. Some pulp
mills in Georgia burn only wood and bark; other mills primarily
burn some mixture of coal, wood, fuel oil, or natural gas. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lime Mud </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Lime mud is also disposed of as a solid waste. Pulp mills have
lime kilns for regenerating lime mud from the liquor recovery
process. Often lime kiln capacity does not meet mill requirement,
thus requiring disposal of lime mud and purchase of fresh lime.
Waste lime mud generation is only related to kiln capacity, not
production. Waste lime mud generation of up to 200 tons per day
is reported. Other lime related wastes are green liquor dregs and
slaker grits in relatively low volumes. Burning of noncondensable
gasses in lime kilns can also increase the volume of grits and
dregs generated. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Undigested Knots</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Knots generated in the digester and are resin-loaded pieces of
wood that are not fully digestible due to poor impregnation with
cooking liquor and high lignin content. This material is
separated from digested pulp in various screening operations.
Some mills mechanically break the knots down and reintroduce them
to the digester or pulp stream. Other mills dispose of knots as a
solid waste or burn for energy recovery. Undigested knots also
contain black liquor and are a source of air emissions. </p>
<p><strong>Wastewater</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Process Wastewater </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Water is the largest raw material input in the pulp and paper
industry. Georgia integrated brownstock mills will use 5,000 to
12,000 gallons per ton of production. Bleached pulp mills in
Georgia have water usages ranging from 13,000 to 25,000 gallons
per ton; approximately 50% is used in the bleaching process.
Specialty pulp mills can approach 40,000 gallons per ton. Recycle
mills also use a considerable amount of water. The lowest water
usage noted during this study was 810 gallons per ton at
Sweetwater Paper Board, a corrugated recycling mill located in
Austell, Georgia. The highest usage was over 17,000 gallons per
ton in a recycling mill with deinking processes and bleaching. </p>
<p>Wastewater as previously discussed can contain methanol,
chlorinated compounds, cellulose, and other materials. Wastewater
removes undesirable material from the process and carries them to
a treatment system to partially concentrate and remove,
stabilize, or destroy those materials that could damage the
environment prior to releasing the water. Wastewater is generated
in every washing stage, as well as in the woodyard and chemical
generation. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Storm Water </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Storm water may be affected by chipping dust that escapes as
fugitive releases from the chipper or chip piles. Bark, debarking
dust, and other woody debris are lost around the edges of
woodyards. This material was obviously present on the ground
around some manufacturing plants visited. Storm water
contamination with wood dust is not likely to cause long term
problems such as ground water contamination, but can prompt
complaints from neighbors, block storm drains, and foul standing
water. Storm water runoff is often captured and treated. Wood
yard areas and areas where pulp or pulping chemicals are spilled
do contribute to storm water pollution and increased treatment
costs. Mills typically collect and treat storm water from outside
production and storage areas. Increased BOD is the primary storm
water pollutant. </p>
<p><strong>Hazardous Waste</strong> </p>
<p>Hazardous waste is generated by pulp mills but not in large
quantities. Maintenance wastes from degreasing and painting are
typical waste sources. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Barriers ">Pollution Prevention Barriers </a></h3>
<p><strong>Economic Barriers</strong> </p>
<p>The greatest barrier to pollution prevention in the pulp and
paper industry is economic. A pulp mill is a large scale, mostly
in-line production process composed of large and expensive
devices. In-line production means that all of the product passes
through each process component. If one piece fails, then the
entire mill ceases to function. There are exceptions. Older mills
tend to have many batch digesters while newer and upgraded mills
use one or two continuous digesters. Process change becomes
riskier as mills move more to in-line production. </p>
<p>A large integrated pulp mill producing 2,000 tons per day of
product will cost almost $1 billion to construct if built today.
Recovery boilers can cost up to $100 million for new
installations. In addition to expensive equipment, the product is
very expensive. Virgin bleached pulp prices have been in excess
of $1,000 per ton. Upgrades to a pulp mill could require many
weeks of construction. A single week of downtime could cost $14
million in lost sales. For these reasons, changes in technology
are not implemented until the risk of failure is very low and
economic payback high. </p>
<p>Newer pulping technologies are definitely more efficient that
older technologies. Due to the cost of equipment and upgrades, it
is difficult to justify major changes or replacement of entire
systems until the working life of existing equipment has been
reached. </p>
<p><strong>Technological Barriers</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Kraft Pulping</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>The Kraft process is the leading pulping technology in
Georgia. Mechanical pulping is used at one mill. Kraft pulping in
many ways has remained unchanged; wood, water, energy, NaOH, and
Na<sub>2</sub>S are the traditional process inputs. Wastes
generated are methanol and other various organic chemicals, solid
waste, wastewater, sulfur compounds, and waste heat. Reduction in
pollution has resulted primarily from pollution control measures
such as combustion of vented gasses and scrubbing combustion
stack gasses. Equipment modification to improve boiler combustion
efficiency has also reduced emissions. Pollution prevention
techniques have resulted in improved recovery of NaOH and Na<sub>2</sub>S,
reduced water usage, and reduced energy usage. Even with these
improvements, the Kraft pulping process will continue to produce
organic waste. Environmental pollution reduction from the Kraft
process will continue to be primarily capture and control since
there are few if any methods available for eliminating pollution
at the source. Use of catalysts and enzymes in pulping represents
the first new technology changes in many years. Catalysts are
discussed later in the report under Alternatives to Chlorine
Bleaching. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bleaching and Pulp Washing</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, pulp washing and bleaching are continuing
to change to reduce waste. Economic barriers and some technical
barriers still exist in implementing pollution prevention
technologies in bleaching and pulp washing, but there appears to
be a steady evolution of these processes to reduce waste and
cost. </p>
<p>Technological evolution in bleaching is evident by reviewing
the existing bleaching technologies in 1995 compared to 1970.
Bleaching began almost exclusively using chlorine and sodium
hypochlorite. Due initially to dioxin concerns in the 1980s,
alternatives to chlorine were researched and implemented.
Chlorine dioxide has now either totally or partially replaced
elemental chlorine and sodium hypochlorite. Oxygen and peroxide
are also now used in bleaching and prebleaching stages. In
addition, various methods to improve delignification in the
pulping stage have been developed which reduce the dependence
upon chlorine in bleaching. </p>
<p><strong>Organizational Barriers</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lack of Pollution Prevention Programs</strong><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>The typical pulp or paper mill in Georgia does not have a
program in place to evaluate wastes and develop methods of
reducing. The primary focus of pulp mill personnel is to keep the
mill in production by meeting quality, production, and
environmental regulatory mandates. Mill personnel are extremely
busy; tasks beyond the normal scope of work are commonly handled
by using consultants. Pulp and paper mills use external
consultants for environmental and design services. Through
organizations such as the Technical Association of the Pulp and
Paper Industry (TAPPI), the National Council of the Paper
Industry for Air and Stream Improvement (NCASI), the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other pulp and paper
trade associations, technologies that improve environmental
performance are well known to both mill personnel and
consultants. For this reason, new mills are constructed with
leading edge technologies; many older mills have also upgraded.
Several pulp and paper manufacturers have corporate programs to
reduce waste. In general, these programs are designed to identify
and evaluate those leading edge technologies. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lack of Waste Accounting</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the more mundane aspects of waste minimization and
pollution prevention are overlooked. Mills have various means of
accounting for waste generation, but these methods mostly focus
on major waste steams. Ash generation, sludge generation, solid
waste generation, and overall water usage are known. Specific
sources of waste and water usage are unknown. Georgia pulp mills
generally account for waste generation and cost as overhead. Most
mills have not attempted to trace waste generation back to
individual processes. In some of the mills, water usage was only
known as a total volume. Flows to individual processes, and waste
materials contributed to the wastewater stream by individual
processes are unknown. Approximately 50% of the Georgia pulp
mills have formal pollution prevent plans to evaluate waste and
implement waste minimization methods. Even the mills with formal
pollution prevention programs tend to look toward the
technological solutions and not the simpler methods such as
materials management. The simpler methods often require a
significant investment of time to develop and implement, but can
have very large financial returns. </p>
<p>Air emissions by pulp and paper mills are calculated using
emission factors or they are measured. Emissions factors provide
an estimate of the amount of a chemical emitted per ton of pulp
production. Emission factors are based on the type of equipment
used to produce pulp. For example, the emissions factor for
estimating methanol emissions from a batch digester and blow tank
will be greater than the emissions factor for a continuous
digester on a per ton basis. NCASI, EPA, and other organizations
publish emissions factors. Emissions calculated by using
emissions factors may be higher or lower than measured values
depending upon a number of factors. The general state of repair
of equipment can also affect emissions; additional emissions due
to failures may not be calculated when using emissions factors
according to some mill personnel. In one facility, the pulp
washer appeared to have some seal damage in an access door
emitting steam, liquid, and odor. Other mills had darkly colored
liquid streams escaping from pulp washers and storage areas. In
every case, the liquid was collected in sewers for treatment at
the mill's treatment plant. Air emissions from these failures may
not be estimated by using emission factors according to some pulp
mill personnel. The use of emission factors does not seem to
provide an incentive for repair of relatively minor system leaks
such as these. Measurement of emissions may not provide an
incentive either since emissions from leaks or failures would be
only measured if sensors were located in close proximity or were
intentionally measured. Leaks from equipment in disrepair do
increase operating cost and actual emissions. Preventive
maintenance and leak repair should be included in all pulp mill
procedures. Mills that have few leaks, few spills, and maintain a
high level of housekeeping may release fewer air emissions than
mills that do not maintain equipment or housekeeping as well.
However, reported emissions for the two situations may be the
same based on stack measurements or emissions factors. </p>

offers the use of a 20 ton per day pulp mill for research of
ozone, chlorine free, enzyme assisted, and other bleaching and
deinking technologies. </p>
<p><strong>Corporate and Facility Pollution Prevention Programs </strong></p>
<p>Several of the Georgia mills use their corporate engineering
and technical resources to reduce waste. Other plants have mill
personnel who measure and characterize waste streams with the
goal of reducing waste. Whether using corporate or plant
personnel, some mills actively track waste generation to the
source and seek ways to reduce. A case study is attached in
Appendix I describing Weyerhaeuser's approach to waste
minimization. Tenneco, Weyerhaeuser, Georgia-Pacific, Fort
Howard, Southeast, Federal, Gilman, and Rayonier are some of the
major pulp and paper manufacturers in Georgia with waste
minimization programs. In each case, the specific goals and
methods may be very different depending upon the organization. </p>

<h3><a name="Key">Key Pollution Prevention Issues</a> </h3>

publications. </p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="Facility"><strong>Lack of Facility Pollution
Prevention Programs</strong></a><strong> </strong></h3>
<p>A number of mills do have formal pollution prevention plans
while others do not. Some of the mills are part of wider
corporate pollution prevention plans. The goals and methods used
are different for each program. Regardless of goals and methods
used, the plans should all include waste audits that track waste
streams back to the source and estimate total costs associated
with the waste streams. Once costs are known, specific projects
can be identified that can be justified for their cost reduction
potential. Discussions with plant and corporate personnel
indicated that many of the plans do not include this basic
requirement. </p>
<p>Some of the plans were directed toward long-term technology
goals such as zero discharge of wastewater or total chlorine free
bleaching. These goals are necessary, but may be realized in 10
or more years. All current paper making technologies will not be
replaced with long-term technology changes. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Water"><strong>Water Use Reduction and Reuse</strong></a> </h3>
<p>Water is used by all pulp, paper, and recycling mills in
significant quantity. There are a number of processes which use
water and generate waste water, but the primary uses are pulp
washing following digestion and bleaching, and deinking and
washing in recycling mills. Since most water used by a pulp mill
is heated prior to use, reducing water usage can very
significantly reduce energy usage. Energy costs and savings are
often the most significant aspects of water usage reduction
programs. </p>
<p><strong>Brownstock Washing </strong></p>
<p>Pulp washing is usually done in either of four washing
systems, vacuum drum, pressure, diffusion, or Chemi. A brief
description of each is provided below. Washing is done to remove
cooking chemicals and to remove lignin breakdown byproducts as a
prerequisite to pulp drying, bleaching, and paper making. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vacuum Drum Washing</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Vacuum drum washers usually consist of three to six
counter-flow stages. Each stage consists of a rotating screen
drum which has a partial vacuum applied to the interior. The drum
sits in a tank where pulp is diluted with wash water. The vacuum
draws a pulp mat against the surface and wash water through the
mat. The drum rotation advances the washed pulp mat to the next
dilution tank. Wash water discharged from this wash stage is sent
to the previous washing stage. At least six Georgia mills use
vacuum drum washers. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pressure Washing</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Pressure washing is similar to vacuum drum, but differs by
spraying water under pressure through the pulp mat as the drum
rotates. At least one mill in Georgia uses pressure washing. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Diffusion Washing </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Diffusion washing is a counterflow process that takes place in
one or more stages. Pulp flow is upward and is carried on a
perforated plate; water flow is downward through a series of
baffles. This method offers a high degree of cleaning with low
water use. At least three mills use diffusion washers in Georgia. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chemi or Belt Washing</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>A Chemi or belt washer is perhaps the simplest washing system
design and offers reduced water usage with excellent cleaning.
Belt washing is a counter flow process where pulp enters the
washer area on a wire belt. Washing takes place under a series of
showers. Clean water enters on the opposite end from the pulp and
is sprayed vertically through the pulp. The used wash water is
then collected and reapplied to the dirtier pulp by the next
washing head countercurrent to the direction that the pulp moves.
This process is continued through at least seven stages until the
wash water is saturated with liquor after washing immediately
incoming pulp. The wash water is then sent to the recovery
process. Two mills in Georgia are known to use Chemi washers.
Reduced dilution of the liquor recovered from washing will result
in reduced energy usage in the recovery process. </p>
<p>The effluent from brownstock washing contains black liquor
that must be recovered in addition to varying amounts of water.
Diffusion washing and belt washing can reduce the amount of water
used per ton of pulp in brownstock washing by 50% or more
according to published data. However, the mills in Georgia do not
show order of magnitude reductions when using the newer washing
technologies. Comparison between mills is difficult due to
product mixes of virgin and recycled pulp; mills that have
replaced vacuum drum washing with diffusion or belt washing
report that improved cleanliness or water reductions were
achieved with the new technology, but exact figures were not
available. Improved cleanliness is important in reducing
bleaching load. </p>
<p><strong>Costs of Pulp Washing With a Chemi Washer</strong> </p>
<p>Although several mills in Georgia have upgraded pulp washing,
specific information on cost and water usage was not available.
In the EPA's document, Pollution Prevention Technologies for the
Bleached Kraft Segment of the U.S. Pulp and Paper Industry, the
following estimate was provided. </p>

        <td width="50%">Payback Period</td>
        <td width="20%">4.25 to 4.9 years</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>Due to the long payback period, replacement of vacuum drum
washers with a Chemi washer is more feasible in a new
installation or when a new washer is required to replace a vacuum
drum washer that has reached the end of its service life. The
installation cost does include all support facilities such as a
building to house the unit and piping. The actual replacement
cost would be less if support facilities were already existing.
Also, the operating cost reduction does not include savings in
the bleaching stage. Improved washing will result in less lignin
in the pulp thus reducing bleaching requirements. </p>
<p><strong>Bleach Mill Effluent Reduction</strong> </p>
<p>Washing of brownstock prior to bleaching allows the recovery
of wash effluent in the recovery boiler. Once the pulp has gone
through a chlorination stage, recovery is not practical due to
corrosiveness. Improved washing and increased delignification
prior to bleaching decreases bleaching load and reduces the load
placed on wastewater treatment. Bleach mill effluent reductions
can then best be achieved prior to any chlorination stage.
Improved delignification can allow bleached pulp mills to
eliminate certain bleaching and extraction stages while achieving
the same level of brightness. Elimination of a bleaching stage
can reduce water usage by 2,500 gallons per ton of pulp
production. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bleach Mill Effluent Recycling</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Several mills and corporate organizations are exploring reuse
or are reusing bleach mill effluent in previous bleaching stages.
Bleach mill effluent accounts for approximately 50% of a bleached
Kraft mill's water usage with effluent streams from each stage of
bleaching. Recycling water to previous stages could reduce water
usage by 60% depending upon the bleaching configuration.
Wastewater from bleaching and pulping will contain methanol,
other organics, and chlorinated compounds. Reuse in uncontrolled
areas could increase air emissions. Typically, a mill will
recycle white water from the paper machine back through the
various bleaching stages in a counter-current process. </p>
<p><strong>Other Water Use Reduction Opportunities</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Process Pump Seals</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Seal water used in various pumps has been eliminated by
replacing with mechanical face and lip seals in several
facilities around the state. Seal water flows are typically not
very high, but are continuous and can add up to large volumes
over time. Replacing water seals with mechanical seals usually
increases energy consumption due to friction. Seal water can also
be collected and reused for other processes but may contain
contaminants from the chemical passing through the pump. </p>
<p>Seals are also a source of air emissions, water pollution, and
raw material loss due to leakage of the material being pumped
through the seal. Chemical pump seals are being investigated by
some mills for replacement with sealless and magnetically coupled
pumps. An example of a sealless pump is a diastolic tube pump.
Magnetically coupled pumps transmit power from the motor to the
pump with a magnetic field. Traditionally, both designs are
better suited for low torque applications. In either case,
sealless pumps are not new technology and should work well in the
pulp industry. </p>
<p>Union Camp in Savannah has replaced water lubricated seals
with mechanical seals. According to an article published in the
November 1995 issue of &quot;Pulp and Paper,&quot; replacement of
braided packing seals with a self-lubricating compound has
reduced water usage and equipment failure. The compound used is a
&quot;colloidal mixture of lubricants amalgamated with Aragraphe
fibers&quot; manufactured by Tom-Pac of Montreal, Canada. The
sealing compound also allows leaks to be repaired by injecting
more compound into the seal. Replacement of water lubricated
seals also reduces the potential of bearing and gearbox
contamination with water, and seal water contamination with oil
or other materials. Union Camp points out that 95% of the seal
replacement projects have been successful. The benefits of this
waterless sealing compound to Union Camp have been: </p>
<ul>
    <li>reduced water usage</li>
    <li>reduced equipment damage</li>
    <li>reduced water contamination</li>
    <li>reduced maintenance time</li>
</ul>
<p>Vacuum pumps are used to supply vacuum to vacuum drum pulp
washers and other mill equipment. Vacuum pumps are typically
liquid ring pumps which use water for sealing and cooling. Water
usage is continuous and can be high depending upon the size of
the pump. Liquid ring vacuum pumps represent the common
technology used in hospitals and other facilities needing large
vacuum volumes. In resent years, oil-free and oil-flooded rotary
screw pumps have been used in some cases to replace liquid ring
pumps to reduce water usage in hospitals. This technology may be
useful in the paper industry to replace liquid ring vacuum pumps.
Water discharged from liquid ring pumps should be suitable for
reuse in any number of mill applications, but may contain some
process contaminants. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>White Water Recycling</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Paper machines can generate significant amounts of wastewater.
One mill generated 3,000 gallons per ton of paper. White water is
typically clean, but may contain some contaminants such as fiber,
lignin compounds, and various organics. Some of Georgia's pulp
mills are recycling paper machine water back to bleaching or
pulping operations. Where bleaching does not exist, white water
from the paper machine can be reused or partially reused directly
in pulp washing or in the wet end of the paper machine. One
Georgia mill recycling corrugated material reuses all white water
after clarification. The sludge that settles during clarification
is also reintroduced into the process. The company, Sweetwater
Paper discharges approximately 810 gallons per ton of pulp
produced. </p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
    <tr>
        <td width="100%">
        <p align="center"><strong>Case Study -- Recycling of
        White Water at Sweetwater Paper</strong> </p>
        <p align="left">Sweetwater Paper produces wallboard
        backing made from recycled paper. The paper is not
        deinked. Waste paper is repulped; new backing board is
        then made on a paper machine. Water removed from the
        board during sheet forming and drying is sent to a
        wastewater treatment plant where it undergoes
        clarification and pH adjustment. The majority of the
        water is then recycled with a small discharge of 180
        gallons per minute. Sweetwater manufactures approximately
        320 tons per day of wallboard backing. </p>
        <p align="left">Calcium sulphate is the most problematic
        component in the recycled water stream. Calcium sulphate
        is brought into the plant as a component of the waste
        paper. If the concentration becomes too great, calcium
        sulphate crystals can form within the plumbing system
        resulting in blockage. Sweetwater maintains solubility by
        adjusting pH and limited water discharge to prevent
        crystallization. Sweetwater discharges 810 gallons per
        ton of product, which is two to four times lower than is
        expected for this type of mill. In addition to recycling
        water, clarifier sludge is added back to the process. The
        only solid waste generated is from foreign materials such
        as plastic strapping present in the incoming waste paper. </p>

<h3><a name="Chlorine  "><strong>Alternatives to Chlorine
Bleaching</strong> </a></h3>
<p><strong>Waste Generation </strong></p>
<p>Wastes of greatest concern from bleaching are chloroform and
dioxins. Elemental chlorine and sodium hypochlorite are the two
bleaching chemicals most associated with chloroform and dioxin
formation. For this reason, most mills have eliminated sodium
hypochlorite and replaced chlorine to some degree. Of the six
virgin bleached Kraft pulp mills in Georgia, three have replaced
elemental chlorine with chlorine dioxide. The other three have
substituted varying amounts of chlorine dioxide. </p>
<p>Bleaching, as previously discussed, is a multistage process.
Historically, bleaching was considered a separate process from
digestion and began with a chlorine stage. Currently, with
elemental chlorine use in decline, it is more difficult to define
where digestion or delignification ends and bleaching begins.
Some of the pollution prevention options discussed below perhaps
are closer to delignification than bleaching in historical terms.
In either case, the basic purpose of bleaching is to further
selectively delignify pulp. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chlorine Dioxide Substitution</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Georgia pulp mills have proven that 100% chlorine dioxide
replacement for elemental chlorine is technically and
economically feasible. Mills nationally have reported pulp
quality improvements by switching to chlorine dioxide. Some mills
using less than 100% chlorine dioxide report that increases in
substitution rate are not economically feasible. The lack of
economic feasibility seems to be related to equipment costs as
opposed to chlorine dioxide cost. Replacement or upgrade of
washers, bleach tower materials, and chlorine dioxide generators
were all mentioned as needed prior to increasing substitution
rates at these mills. Full substitution can also cause reduced
pulp yield and reduced brightness according to some published
data. </p>
<p>Chlorine dioxide costs more than elemental chlorine. Even with
chlorine dioxides greater reactivity, chlorine dioxide can cost
more than eight times as much as elemental chlorine according to
EPA documents. It is estimated by the EPA that the total cost of
generating one pound of chlorine dioxide is approximately $0.50.
The cost of an equivalent amount of chlorine is $0.06. In a 1,000
ton per day mill operating at 11% substitution, an increase to
50% substitution would cost $5 million initially with an increase
in operating costs of $1.9 million annually or $5.40 per ton.
Increasing to 100% substitution would cost $15.9 million
initially with an increase in operating cost of $7.1 million
annually or $20.30 per ton. Considering that pulp prices can
approach $1,000 per ton, 100% substitution represents an increase
in operating cost of about 2%. These estimates are based on
general averages and not one particular mill. </p>
<p>Reducing dependence on chlorine bleach can best be achieved
prior to bleaching. Bleaching is basically an extended chemical
delignification process. Chlorine is used to selectively
delignify pulp without causing the damage to cellulose that
traditional pulp digestion causes. The key to reducing chlorine
use is to find methods which delignify further prior to the
bleaching stage. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Chip Uniformity</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Uniform, thin chips achieve a greater degree of
delignification in standard or modified cooking processes by
allowing the chip charge to reach a predictable amount of
digestion using a specific chemical and thermal mix. Various
methods are available and include improved screening and
rechipping of oversized chips. This is a lower cost option for
improved delignification with or without bleaching. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Extended Delignification </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A number of methods exist for improving delignification
without extensive cellulose degradation. At least four mills in
Georgia use extended delignification techniques. These techniques
are primarily applicable to continuous digesters. New digesters
can cost upwards of $15 million. Some Kamyr digesters, which are
the most common type, can be refitted at costs reported in the $1
million range. Batch digesters can also be refitted in some
cases. Reduced operating cost by refitting results in payback
periods of approximately 18 months according to EPA documents.
The cost savings are reported to be in steam and reduction in
bleach chemical usage. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Oxygen Delignification </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Oxygen delignification requires the addition of a reaction
tower between the brownstock washers and bleach plant. Oxygen and
sodium hydroxide is added to brownstock. Reduction of bleaching
chemistry by 50% can be achieved in the bleaching process if
preceded by oxygen delignification. Washing follows oxygen
delignification; effluent can be recovered or discharged. At
least two Georgia mills use oxygen delignification. Cost of
building a new oxygen delignification tower can be in the $10 to
$30 million range, but may be offset by reducing bleaching needs.
Operating costs have been estimated to decrease by up to $3.70
per ton for softwood and to increase by up to $6.65 per ton for
hardwood based on studies conducted in Sweden and published by
the EPA. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ozone Delignification and Bleaching</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Ozone delignification is not used by any Georgia mills; only
one full-scale mill operates within the U.S. Ozone
delignification is similar to oxygen delignification. The Union
Camp mill in Franklin, Virginia, began operation in 1992 with an
OZEoD extended delignification and bleaching process at 1,000
tons per day of bleached kraft production. The overall
installation cost was $113 million. Operating costs of the OZEoD
delignification and bleaching process are reported to be about
50% less when compared to the more conventional CEDED or DEDED
process. D represents chlorine dioxide, E represents extraction,
O represents oxygen, and Z represents ozone. There is one pilot
mill in Georgia capable of ozone delignification and bleaching.
The mill is operated by the University of Georgia for the use of
the school and industrial customers for research. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Alternative Chemicals Used in Bleaching</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Chlorine and chlorine dioxide are the only bleaching chemicals
used in Georgia by virgin Kraft pulp mills. Oxygen and peroxide
are used to augment sodium hydroxide extraction. Oxygen and
peroxide act to delignify in the extraction stage essentially
replacing chlorine in later stages. Sodium hydrosulfite is used
by one mill in a bleaching operation producing newsprint. No
Georgia mills use ozone in bleaching, although ozone bleaching is
used in a pilot mill in South Carolina and a full-scale mill in
Virginia. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Enzyme Bleaching</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Enzymes are used by wood eating insects and bacteria to break
lignin bonds or to delignify pulp. Xylanase is an enzyme family
related to the chemicals secreted by such bacteria; it appears to
be useful in pulp bleaching, extended delignification, and
deinking. Mills nationally have used this chemical in trial runs;
results indicate that up to 50% reductions in chlorine
requirements can be achieved without damage to the cellulose.
Application of xylanase appears to be simple. Following
brownstock washing, xylanase is applied to the pulp as it enters
the high density storage tank. Xylanase works in the high density
storage tank and requires between 30 and 180 minutes of reaction
time. A washing stage follows the xylanase treatment. No Georgia
mills report using xylanase, but it appears to be a low cost
method of achieving significant results. Other enzymes such as
mannanase are being investigated. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Catalyst Improved Delignification </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Anthraquinone </p>
<p>Anthraquinone is a pulping reaction catalyst which was found
to increase the speed of pulping, increase yield, and reduce
pulping chemical usage by up to 10%. Anthraquinone is one of the
few new technological discoveries in the Kraft pulping field. Due
to cost, anthraquinone has not been used extensively in the U.S.
except in testing. Approximately 100 mills worldwide use
anthraquinone. Although developed as a pulping pollution
prevention technology, it may have greater use and be more cost
effective if used as an aid to extended delignification. The cost
of anthraquinone is expected to drop in the near future due to
patent expiration. Renewed interest may develop as a result.
Anthraquinone has been estimated to increase pulping costs by
approximately $5.00 per ton, but with increased yields of 0.75%
and reduced recovery boiler loading. An increase yield of 0.75%
represents an increase in production of 7.5 tons per day in a
1,000 tons per day mill. </p>
<p>Polysulfide </p>
<p>Polysulfide is another catalyst mentioned in trade magazines
applicable in pulping. Yield increase of 1.5% are possible with
improvements in strength. It is possible to use both
anthraquinone and polysulfide together. TAPPI publications report
that yield increases of approximately 2.5% are possible. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Log"><strong>Log Yard Waste Reduction</strong></a> </h3>
<p><strong>Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<p>Log yard waste is for some mills the largest solid waste
stream. Mills with on-site landfills will often use some of this
material as landfill cover, but there is often more waste than
needed for this purpose. Log yard wastes are typically bark and
woodchips mixed with soil, oversized logs and undersized limbs,
metal-containing logs, and mold damaged chips. Energy usage in
the form of fuel for log handling trucks is another raw material
input. In addition to pulp mills, saw mills, plywood plants, and
similar facilities will have log or wood yards and use some of
the processes described below. </p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Log Yard Operations</strong> </p>
<p>The purpose of a log yard is to receive incoming logs and
chips, debark logs, chip logs, and store bark and chips. Logs,
chips, and bark are delivered by truck and rail. These materials
are stored in stacks or piles. Logs are handled either by
rail-mounted cranes or large wheeled log trucks. Logs and chips
are stored by using some inventory management program to reduce
weathering and spoiling. </p>
<p><strong>Specific Causes of Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bark and Chip Contamination</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Bark and wood chips that become mixed with soil cannot be used
for fuel or pulping. Both materials fall from the margins of
piles and become soiled. Additional bark falls from logs prior to
debarking as a result of handling. All log yards are outside
facilities. Some are partially or completely paved. Others are
completely unpaved. Soil that becomes mixed with chips and bark
comes from exposed soil in the log yard. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Over-sized Logs</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Oversized logs are logs that are too large to be debarked or
chipped by mill equipment. The material is delivered to mill log
yards by truck and rail. Delivery of oversized logs is caused by
a lack of incoming material inspection. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Metal-containing Logs</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Metal-containing logs have nails or wire imbedded in the logs.
The metal may not be visible, but is detected electronically on
the chipper or debarking decks. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Woody Debris and Soil</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Undersized limbs and other debris such as soil and sand are
delivered attached to logs or trapped between logs. Soil and sand
is also delivered with bark and wood chips that are manufactured
offsite. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Decay</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Various molds damage logs and chips. The length of time stored
as well as weather conditions contribute to mold growth. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Poor Log Yard Layout </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Fuel usage can be significant. In one logyard that was handled
entirely by log trucks, an estimate of the miles traveled
annually by log trucks totaled 17,000 miles. The distance driven
contributes to fuel usage and maintenance costs. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Log Yard Delivery Specifications</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Oversized and undersized log disposal in landfills can be
reduced to near zero. Publishing of log size standards and
rigidly enforcing delivery standards will prevent delivery of
oversized logs. Incoming inspection of logs can prevent delivery
and disposal. Oversized logs that are delivered can be cut to
smaller size so as to fit in existing equipment or sold to
specialty lumber companies and mills that can accept larger logs. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purchase of Additional Chipping Equipment</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Undersized logs can be debarked and chipped. Debarkers are
advertised in trade magazines that can handle small and irregular
shapes. Once debarked, undersized logs can be chipped. Several
mills have purchased mobile chippers to handle this material. </p>
<p>Metal-containing logs were traditionally landfilled. Some
mills cut the metal-containing area from logs. The
metal-containing portion is landfilled; the metal-free portion is
debarked and chipped. There are chippers that can chip
metal-containing logs without damage. Metal, which is most often
steel, is magnetically separated. This material can then be used
a boiler fuel or chips for particleboard manufacture. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Paving and Improving Log Yards </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Paving log yards seem to be the best practice for reducing
soil contamination. Bark and chips that do fall onto the ground
will be less likely to become contaminated. Paved areas also
allow bark and chips to be collected for use. Maintenance costs
will probably decline for log yard trucks, debarkers, and
chipping equipment by preventing soil contamination. Log flumes
will also have reduced soil loading. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chip and Bark Cleaning</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Wood chips and bark that has become contaminated with soil can
be cleaned in vibratory screening systems. Several mills are
considering screening systems. The bark and chips would be used
as fuel after screening. Soil and fines can be used as landfill
cover or other soil use. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Log Yard Layout </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Fuel and truck maintenance costs can be reduced by designing
log yards to reduced distance driven. Time and material flow
studies are commonly conducted in manufacturing plants to reduce
fork truck travel and travel time. The same techniques and
benefits could be realized in log yards. </p>

<h3><a name="Lime"><strong>Lime Mud Waste Reduction</strong></a><strong> </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<p>Lime mud waste is directly related to lack of lime kiln
capacity. Some mills dispose of up to 200 tons per day. Lime mud
disposed of must be replaced by purchasing calcium oxide.
Disposal and purchase increase operating cost and fill landfills.
There is some offsite reuse of lime mud, but the majority is
disposed in landfills or storage lagoons. </p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Lime Kilns</strong> </p>
<p>Lime kilns are typically long rotating tubes where combustion
gasses and calcium carbonate pass through changing calcium
carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. Heat loss is great
since insulation is difficult to apply to the rotating housing.
Downtime is one reported additional problem. For various reasons
such as mechanical failure, kilns are often offline. Since pulp
mills operate continuously, lime mud produced during kiln
downtime is often landfilled. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Install Second or Larger Lime Kiln</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some mills have increase kiln capacity by adding second kilns.
In some cases, Georgia mills have reclaimed tons of lime mud
stored in treatment lagoons after adding kiln capacity. Kilns are
high cost devices. The economics of installing a new kiln are not
known. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vertical Kilns</strong><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>Vertical lime kilns can offer reduced down-time, improved
energy efficiency, and larger kiln capacity in a smaller
footprint area. Vertical kilns have not traditionally been used
due to some manufacturing limitations. A NICE3 grant was awarded
to Altex Incorporated to develop a vertical lime kiln; the pilot
plant tests are targeted to Weyerhaeuser's Flint River Plant in
Oglethorpe, Georgia. More information is contained in Appendix
II. </p>

<h3><a name="Energy"><strong>Energy Conservation and Recovery</strong></a><strong> </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<p>Energy is heavily used by the pulp and paper industry. Most
mills generate steam and electricity by burning black liquor,
coal, wood, and natural gas. Coal combustion is responsible for
much of the sulphuric acid and sulphur dioxide emissions reported
on the TRI. Additional expense to pulp mills in treating exhaust
stack emissions is also incurred. Ash is also a significant solid
waste stream and disposal problem when burning coal or wood
waste. </p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Energy Generation in Georgia Mills </strong></p>
<p>Mills typically burn wood both as an energy source and
disposal method to reduce volume. Mills that cannot meet their
energy needs from wood waste and black liquor combustion purchase
additional fuel in the form of wood, coal, bark, fuel oil, and
natural gas. Some mills have chosen to only burn wood since it is
a low sulphur fuel source. Many mills generate excess electricity
to sell back to utility companies or participate in the
utilities' power grid load management program. This can be a good
source of revenue for some mills. The majority of energy is used
to generate steam to heat water, processes, or generate
electricity. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options </strong></p>
<p>Sulphur emissions and ash generation can be reduced by burning
less fuel. Less fuel will be burned if the energy demand of the
mill is reduced, and energy value of the fuel is maximized. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Water Usage Reduction</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Since water is generally heated prior to use in mill
operations, water usage reduction will reduce energy costs. If a
heated water flow at 180 F is reduced 100 gallons per minute, the
annual water reduction is 50,400,000 gallons. The energy
reduction assuming 65 F ambient is 46,368,000,000 BTU. Assuming
that water costs $2 per 1,000 gallons, water costs will reduce
$100,800. Energy costs will reduce $289,336 assuming an energy
cost of $6.24 per million BTU. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Thermal Energy Recovery</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Energy demand can be lowered in pulp and paper mills by
capturing and reusing waste heat. Energy lost through cooling
towers, exhaust stacks, wastewater, and product can all be
recovered for reuse. Heat recovery and utilization opportunities
vary at each mill depending upon the mill age and layout. One
mill in Georgia has identified several recovery opportunities. In
this one mill specific example, recovery of heat from wastewater
by installing liquid-to-liquid heat exchangers to heat incoming
process water was estimated to cost approximately $1 million for
installation with a payback of less than two years. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Efficiency</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Energy requirements can be lowered by using more efficient
equipment such as high efficiency electric motors or by
redesigning processes. For example, energy required for drying
can be reduced by decreasing water content of pulp before drying. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Recommendations for Reducing
Energy Usage</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Conduct Energy Audits</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>A complete energy assessment should be conducted at each
facility to identify opportunities. Oglethorpe Power and Georgia
Power, the primary suppliers of electricity in Georgia, both will
conduct very thorough audits complete with recommendations and
cost / benefit estimates. The Energy Analysis and Diagnostic
Center (EADC) of Georgia Tech's Economic Development Institute
also performs advanced energy audits. EADC can be contacted by
calling (404) 894-3844. Some of the common opportunities
identified through audits are: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Replacing cooling towers with heat exchanger loops to
        heat supply water. </li>
    <li>Recovery of steam condensate. </li>
    <li>Recovery of &quot;low grade&quot; heat from hoods, vents,
        and waste water. </li>
</ul>
<p>Specific recommendations will vary at each mill location. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Fuel Storage </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The energy value of wood chips can be increased by decreasing
moisture content. Moisture content will increase in chips stored
in piles outdoors. Placing a cover over chip and bark fuel piles
is one method of reducing moisture, increasing energy value, and
decreasing decay. Mills will sometimes store pulp chips in silos;
this would be a good storage method for fuel as well. Turning
chip piles is another method of decreasing decay and moisture
content. Energy values can increase 10% or more by decreasing
moisture content, with a resulting 10% reduction of ash, fuel
demand, and some air emissions. </p>

<h3><a name="Needs">Pollution Prevention Assistance Needs of the
Georgia Pulp and Paper Manufacturing Sector</a> </h3>
<p><strong>Organizational Needs</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Education on the value of pollution prevention
        programs that provide for audits, waste cost accounting,
        and implementation of projects.</strong><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>This information may allow mills to upgrade existing outdated
technologies by proving or disproving cost effectiveness for
specific projects. Opportunities that are not obvious to mill
personnel can be identified by conducting audits. </p>
<p><strong>Technical Needs </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Information on leading industry and standard pulp
        and paper technologies. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mills are generally aware of the major technologies used by
the pulp industry. Specific information on the benefits of
specific technologies is still needed. Several mills indicated
that leading technologies such as belt washers and pressure
washers had been installed, but provided less than expected
performance. Technologies used by other industries for
maintenance cleaning and coating, or water filtration may be of
use to pulp and paper mills in replacing processes. Several
requests for this type of information were made by mill staff
during research for this paper. </p>
<p><strong>Technology Research Needs</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Research</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Basic research needs of the pulp and paper industry are being
met by various trade and educational institutions. Research
currently focuses on enzyme and catalytic augmentation of current
processes. Additional research involving zero-effluent mill
design is ongoing. Some industry experts predict that the next
century will bring totally biologic and enzymic pulping and
bleaching which will reduce energy and chemical use. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Applied Research</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Of greater interest to pulp and paper mills is bringing
current laboratory technology to the pulp mill. Enzymes,
catalysts, alternative bleaching, water reuse technology, and
advances in lime calcining are areas of applied research
interest. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Approaches">Approaches to Meeting Assistance Needs
of Georgia Pulp and Paper Manufacturers</a> </h3>
<p>The following section discusses how P<sup>2</sup>AD will meet
the pollution prevention needs of Georgia mills. </p>
<p><strong>Meeting Organizational Needs</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Provide Pollution Prevention Training </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Organization needs are primarily education and training of
mill management and production staff on the pollution prevention
techniques. The ultimate goal is to have each mill conduct
pollution prevention assessment, evaluate results, and implement
cost-effective solutions. Several Georgia mills and corporate
organizations do have working pollution prevention plans in
place. </p>
<p>Two roles that Georgia P<sup>2</sup>AD (in conjunction with
Georgia Tech, UGA, IPST, Herty Foundation, etc.) can play in pulp
and paper mill pollution prevention planning are to improve
awareness among mill personnel and to facilitate communication
between different pulp mills. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Facilitate Exchange of Information Between
        Manufacturers</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Facilitation can occur by identifying successful pollution
prevention programs in pulp mills and educating other mills of
success and opportunities identified. Publicizing successes
through published information and providing public forums for
information exchange are the methods that P<sup>2</sup>AD and its
partners can use. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Provide Experienced-based Training to Georgia
        Mills</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Teaching and training mill personnel by offering industry wide
and mill specific workshops are the suggested approaches for
providing general pollution prevention training. Specific
training on pollution prevention techniques applicable to a
particular mill process is also needed. In order to meet these
needs, P<sup>2</sup>AD and its partners must develop greater
expertise in pulp and paper mill processes. P<sup>2</sup>AD will
gain the needed expertise by participating in training offers
extended by some of Georgia's paper mills. Additional expertise
will be gained by conducting assessments with mill personnel at
Georgia facilities. Contacts made during the research for this
paper will likely lead to assessment opportunities. Training can
take place by attending courses and seminars offered by TAPPI and
other pulp and paper organizations. </p>
<p><strong>Meeting Technical Needs</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Publish Fact Sheets and Case Studies on New and
        Standard Technologies</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Technical needs are primarily information on new technologies
as well as information on industry standard technologies for
reducing waste and cost. Fact sheets providing general
information on new technologies can be developed and can include
enzyme, catalytic, and ozone processes. Case studies of
implementation of mill standard technologies can be developed
also and can include continuous digestion, belt washing,
diffusion washing, extended delignification, oxygen
delignification, and other mill processes. This information can
also be presented in public forums at technology conferences.
Cost reduction is perhaps the key issue when presenting case
studies. </p>
<p><strong>Meeting Research Needs </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Existing Research Resources </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD can aid in meeting applied research needs by
encouraging the use of existing state resources such as IPST,
Herty Foundation, and the research pulp mill at the University of
Georgia. The NICE3 project with Weyerhaeuser and Altex is one
such applied research project. Results of this project and other
paper industry related projects will be provided to Georgia mills
through fact sheets and workshops. P<sup>2</sup>AD will
investigate state and national resources for pilot studies in
pulping, bleaching, and paper making. This information can be
distributed through fact sheets and workshops. </p>
<p>Any new or existing basic research needs can be identified
though mill and corporate contact. P<sup>2</sup>AD will attempt
to find existing research programs addressing a particular need.
If research is not ongoing, contacts can be made at various
educational and industry organizations to determine a course of
action. This may include finding researchers with appropriate
expertise, additional industries interesting in funding research,
and other financial assistance sources. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Conclusion">Summary and Conclusion </a></h3>
<p>The purpose of this study is to identify the pollution
prevention needs of the Georgia pulp and paper industry. This
information will be used to develop programs within P<sup>2</sup>AD
or through partners to address industry needs. Some of the needs
and methods of meeting needs are listed below. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Significant opportunity does exist within Georgia pulp
        and paper manufacturers to reduce waste. Waste reduction
        has been accomplished at several mills by implementing
        pollution prevention programs to identify opportunities
        and implement cost-effective solutions. P<sup>2</sup>AD
        can provide the greatest assistance by facilitating the
        development of programs in all mills. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Georgia mills need information to replace existing
        processes with more efficient technology. P<sup>2</sup>AD
        can assist by developing case studies for various mill
        standard and cutting edge technologies. Mills can also
        benefit by learning of technologies used by other
        manufacturing sectors to reduce waste from maintenance
        and other non-process related operations. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Applied research is needed to industrialized new
        technologies. P<sup>2</sup>AD can educate mills on
        various applied research projects and resources in
        Georgia and nationally. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>New basic research needs probably exist concerning such
        issues as enzyme use. These issues will be identified
        through discussions with mill, corporate, trade, and
        research organizations. P<sup>2</sup>AD can assist in
        matching research needs with the appropriate technical
        and financial resources. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD will continue to seek educational
        resources for P<sup>2</sup>AD and partner organization
        staff with the goal of becoming well informed on pulp and
        paper mill industrial practices. P<sup>2</sup>AD cannot
        provide adequate assistance to Georgia mills without
        achieving a high level of expertise in pulp and paper
        technologies. </li>

<h3 align="center"><a name="APPENDIX I">APPENDIX I</a> </h3>
<p align="center"><strong>AN APPROACH TO SOLID WASTE MINIMIZATION
IN THE PAPER INDUSTRY </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Manfred K. Buder, Solid Waste
Minimization Project Manager Weyerhaeuser Company - Tacoma,
Washington</strong> </p>
<p>Since the late 1980s the paper industry has written numerous
success stories in the reduction of the solid waste it generates
and disposes. According to a survey by NCASI (National Council
for Air and Stream Improvement), in 1989, the industry generated
over 13 million tons of process wastes, nearly all of which were
land filled. Most of this waste consists of effluent treatment
solids (&quot;sludge&quot;), boiler ash, lime wastes, and wood
debris. In recent years the industry has made inroads in shifting
much of these residuals to useful alternative practices, such as
energy recovery and land application. </p>
<p>Weyerhaeuser Company ascribes to an integrated approach for
managing the solid wastes from its manufacturing facilities. This
means the coordination of a &quot;full tool kit&quot; of waste
management options and their implementation across all of
Weyerhaeuser's facilities. A key part of this strategy is to make
progress in reducing the generation of and finding beneficial
uses for these solid residual streams. There are five key drivers
for the company's waste minimization effort: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Environmental protection and tightening regulations </li>
    <li>Stakeholder expectations </li>
    <li>Company policy to conserve resources and minimize waste </li>
    <li>Landfill depletion and high replacement costs </li>
    <li>Economic benefits: avoided disposal cost and material
        recovery credits. </li>
</ul>
<p>Accordingly, Weyerhaeuser's mills in Georgia have made and are
continuing endeavors to minimize their solid waste streams. The
Flint River pulp mill recycles scrap metal, office paper, and
aluminum cans. The mill has also made significant strides to
reduce fiber loss, thereby not only conserving raw materials, but
also decreasing the quantity of primary effluent treatment sludge
that needs to be dewatered and hauled to the landfill. Our
composite panels mill at Adel provides another example of solid
waste minimization. Instead of land filling its sanderdust waste,
the mill sells it to a Florida utility company that uses it for
fuel. Per unit of product, our sawmill at Barnesville landfills
less of its manufacturing wastes that any other Weyerhaeuser
sawmill. This is largely because of the mill's resolve to recycle
these residuals as raw materials for particleboard manufacture
(at Adel), for use by horticultural and landscaping companies, as
a fuel (both internally and at Flint River), and for other
beneficial uses. The Barnesville sawmill has also undertaken
pollution prevention measures to reduce its generation of log
yard waste to a level that is unmatched by similar mills within
the company. </p>
<p>In support of this companywide effort, a technical team from
the Corporate R&amp;D group has been charged with providing
assistance to Weyerhaeuser's pulp, paper, paperboard, and wood
products mills to minimize solid waste generation and disposal.
This Solid Waste Minimization (SWMin) Team works with the mills
and with sister entities at the corporate offices to obtain data,
evaluate solid waste reduction opportunities at mills, develop
mill SWMin plans, and stay abreast of pertinent technologies. At
the heart of the program for the past several years have been the
SWMin studies conducted at Weyerhaeuser manufacturing facilities.
The SWMin Team with the help of mill staff, obtains data on
recurring, non-hazardous solid waste streams, and assists the
mills in identifying and capturing significant waste reduction
and utilization opportunities. Since the onset of the decade,
SWMin studies have been completed for nearly all of the company's
thirteen pulp, paper, and paperboard manufacturing sites. In the
last couple of years Weyerhaeuser's SWMin Team has been busy
working with various wood products facilities. </p>
<p>SWMin is a seven-step process. The first step is the planning
and coordination of the study with the mill. Second, the SWMin
Team, typically two engineers and two technicians, conduct a
week-long onsite survey to identify waste steams and their
sources/destinations, glean facts and data, take samples, and
obtain ideas and other input from mill staff. In the third step,
the solid waste streams are screened down to a manageable number
of key streams for which various short- and long-term
minimization alternatives are identified. Three screening
criteria are used: annual disposal cost, annual recovered value
of the stream, and associated environmental issues. Also, at this
point in the process the SWMin Team surveys potential uses and
users for selected residual streams as a reality check against
some of the utilization alternatives being considered. In Step 4,
the most promising combinations of waste streams and minimization
alternatives are further developed and evaluated based on roughly
estimated life-cycle economics. The &quot;top&quot; economic
opportunities are ranked by their net present values and reported
to the mill. These opportunities are reviewed and revised, as
appropriate, with mill staff in the fifth step of the SWMin
process. The purpose of this step is to select a reduction
target, finalize the SWMin project roster, and develop a
five-year SWMin plan. Step 6 is the implementation of this plan
and Step 7 is the documentation of SWMin progress against the
plan. The SWMin Team is available to the mills for technical
support during the implementation and documentation phases. Of
course, since costs, markets, production, and other things do
change over time, it will be necessary to loop back and revisit
some earlier steps in the process from time to time. </p>
<p>Typically, 50 to 100 solid waste streams, some of them very
small on a relative scale, are identified at each company pulp
and paper mill. Most of these wastes end up being land filled,
usually onsite. Others are burned, typically in the power boiler,
or land applied. Secondary effluent treatment solids are
impounded in lagoons for the most part, since few company mills
use activated sludge treatment systems. Small, but growing,
quantities of the mills' solid residuals are recycled. </p>
<p>The largest solid waste categories being generated by the
mills are various woodwastes, boiler ash, effluent treatment
sludges (primary and secondary), recausticizing wastes (dregs,
grits, lime, etc.), and general mill trash. Minimization of these
types of streams is certainly challenging. As examples, the SWMin
team and Weyerhaeuser mills have evaluated, and in many cases
implemented, the following SWMin approaches: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Woodyard debris: (1) debris separation into hog fuel,
        rocks, and fines (soil supplement); and (2) woodyard
        paving.</li>
    <li>Boiler ash: (1) boiler upgrade to improve combustion
        efficiency, (2) flyash screening and char reinjection,
        and (3) ash utilization as a soil supplement or
        construction material. </li>
    <li>Primary sludge: (1) avoiding mixture of ash, line, and
        other separable streams flowing into the primary effluent
        treatment system, (2) spill and leak control, and (3)
        recovery of fiber for internal or external use, or for
        energy recovery as a fuel.</li>
    <li>Grits and dregs: (1) purchased lime quality control, and
        (2) washing and land application. </li>
</ul>
<p>Although there are similarities among mills, the SWMin Team
found the mills to be at different stages of waste management
along the hierarchy of alternatives (i.e., from disposal up
through recycling and source reduction). However, significant
opportunities exist for cost effective improvement at each
facility surveyed. One result of these studies has been to make
the mills more aware of the solid wastes they generate, must
manage, and can minimize through examination of the projected
economic benefit. The risk mitigation &quot;stick&quot; and
opportunity &quot;carrot&quot; are significant enough to
encourage the mills to place higher priority on tracking their
solid wastes and planning for their future reduction. It is
interesting to note that those Weyerhaeuser mills that have made
the greatest effort to improve and have realized the associated
benefits tend to be the strongest advocates for further SWMin
progress. </p>

<h3 align="center"><strong>An Analysis of Pollution Prevention
Opportunities and Impediments in the Wood Products Manufacturing
Sector in Georgia</strong> </h3>
<p><a name="Intro"><strong>Introduction</strong></a> </p>
<p>The purpose of this report is to identify the specific causes
of waste generation, and cost-effective solutions that will
reduce waste in the wood products industry in Georgia. The
benefits of reducing waste are reduced pollution and decreased
operating cost to the business. Releases of high-priority toxic
chemicals are the primary focus of this report, but other
significant solid and liquid wastes will be included. Barriers
exist that limit the implementation of pollution prevention
projects and technologies. Barriers, and strategies to overcome
them will also be discussed in this report. </p>
<p><a name="Methodology"><strong>Methodology</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Review of trade and environmental publications indicated that
the processes responsible for the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)
releases are wood finishing and use of glues to bond wood
together. Businesses that are likely to use these processes were
identified by using the Georgia Manufacturing Directory. Not all
wood products manufacturers were the focus of this study. Only
those manufacturers were included in this study that: </p>
<ul>
    <li>use common processes that could release toxic materials
        to the environment and/or </li>
    <li>employ a large workforce in Georgia and/or </li>
    <li>there were a large number of similar manufacturers in
        Georgia </li>
</ul>
<p>This approach was taken to identify problems and solutions
that are most significant in Georgia. Georgia wood products
manufacturers that met these requirements were surveyed to
identify specific processes, waste reduction activities, sources
of waste reduction information, and barriers to pollution
prevention encountered by these businesses. The survey, selection
of manufacturers to participate in the survey, and survey results
were prepared by Georgia State University, School of Urban
Studies. The response rate for the survey was 15.7% or 97 of the
619 total manufacturers. Some companies that responded to the
survey were visited to observe how processes were used and to
gather information about waste problems other than toxic or
hazardous waste. Plant visits were made to nine wood products
manufacturers. Quantitative information was gathered on the
various chemicals and raw materials used and disposed. The
results of this study are presented in this document. </p>
<p><a name="Summary"><strong>Summary</strong></a> </p>
<p>The following key issues were identified as a result of this
study through the survey, contacts with Georgia wood products
facility personnel, facility tours, interviews with industry
experts, and review of various trade and environmental
publications. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Lack of Facility Pollution Prevention Programs </li>
    <li>Lack of Engineering Resources </li>
    <li>Waste Generation from Spray Application of Coatings </li>
    <li>VOC Emissions from Solvent-based Coatings </li>
    <li>VOC Emissions from Solvent-based Contact Adhesives </li>
    <li>VOC Emissions from Solvent-based Construction Adhesives </li>
    <li>Solid Waste Generation </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>---VOC ---Volatile Organic Compound</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Georgia Pollution Prevention Assistance Division (P<sup>2</sup>AD)
will assist Georgia wood products manufacturers in addressing
these key issues by developing various programs. The approach
that P<sup>2</sup>AD will take is to identify existing resources
that address organizational, technical, and research needs.
Georgia wood products manufacturers can benefit from developing
facility pollution prevention programs. Few wood products
manufacturers have pollution prevention programs; those that have
programs demonstrate significant waste reduction. P<sup>2</sup>AD
can assist manufacturers by contacting them through vendors,
trade organizations, or business organizations to provide
information on up-to-date technologies and the benefits of
pollution prevention planning. Demonstration projects showing the
applicability of new technologies such as water-based coating in
the wood products industry can also be an effective information
transfer tool. </p>

<p>Wood products manufacturers all make different products using
similar processes. Industrial processes will be discussed later
in this report. Even though processes are similar, the
manufacturers are a very size diverse group ranging from 1 to 900
employees located in 90 counties throughout the state. There are
several geographic clusters of manufacturers. </p>
<p>Georgia wood products manufacturers employ approximately
20,000 workers in 619 facilities. More than half, 355 of these
companies employ less than 10 workers. Companies employing more
than 10 but less than 100 workers number 207. There are only 57
companies with more than 100 employees. The only exception is in
the plywood, particleboard, and prefabricated construction
industries; these companies tend to be larger often employing
more than 100 workers. </p>
<p><strong>Metropolitan Atlanta</strong> is home to 166
manufacturers employing 3,600 people. The majority build cabinets
or millwork representing about 60% of the companies. Another 15%
build displays and showrooms for the retail and convention
industry. The majority of businesses near Atlanta are small firms
with less than 25 employees. Only five companies have more than
100 employees. The large companies employ 1,600 and primarily
manufacture millwork and furniture. The largest wood products
manufacturer in metro Atlanta employs approximately 800 workers. </p>
<p><strong>Southeast Georgia</strong> wood products manufacturers
within the target SIC codes number 75, employing approximately
4,000 people. As in the Atlanta area, most of the companies are
small, but there are a number of larger manufacturers. Fourteen
large manufacturers with at least 100 employees have a total
workforce of 3,100. Seven of the large companies manufacture
mobile homes. Others produce furniture, cabinets, and plywood.
Companies with fewer than 100 employees in this region are
involved mostly in the manufacture of cabinets (50%). Other
products are millwork, veneer, paneling, modular construction,
and roof trusses. </p>
<p><strong>Southwest Georgia</strong> wood products manufacturers
employ approximately 4,300 workers in 81 manufacturing
facilities. There are 18 companies with more than 100 employees,
employing a total of 3,100 workers. Mobile homes and
preconstructed buildings are the primary business of eight large
manufacturers. Manufacture of plywood and particleboard is the
main concern of five of the largest companies. There are 63 wood
products manufacturers with fewer than 100 employees in southwest
Georgia. Smaller manufacturers are involved primarily with the
manufacture of cabinets, millwork, and furniture. </p>

<h3><a name="Processes">Wood Products Industrial Processes</a> </h3>
<p>The wood products industry in Georgia consists of
manufacturers that shape, form, finish, or construct with wood.
Examples are prefabricated house builders, furniture
manufacturers, cabinet makers, and plywood manufacturers. Table 2
lists the common processes that are responsible for generation of
the majority of toxic chemical waste. The percentages in the row
beside each process represent a general estimate of the number of
companies that use these processes by SIC code based on survey
results and only represent approximate usage by these industries.
The majority of those surveyed use more than one process.
Printing and paint stripping were the least common processes
used, reported by about 3%. The most common processes reported
are listed below. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Assembly by 80% </li>
    <li>Use of glues and adhesives by 77% </li>
    <li>Spray application by 47% </li>
    <li>Staining by 45% </li>
    <li>Laminating by 42% </li>
    <li>Painting or coating by 42% </li>

<p>Plant visits to wood products manufacturers indicated the
wastes reported in the TRI and LQG reports are common byproducts
of the wood products industry. The difference between the
companies that provide TRI and LQG reports and those that do not
is size. Smaller companies typically use the same processes and
the same chemicals, but fall below reporting limits. It is
improper to assume that waste generation is then actually ten
times more than reported on the TRI based on the number of
employees. However, it is reasonable to assume that releases of
TRI-listed chemicals are greater than reported due to the fact
that most of the companies fall below threshold amounts for
reporting yet still use similar processes and chemicals as the
larger manufacturers. </p>
<p><strong>Toxic Releases</strong> </p>
<p>The specific chemicals reported released by these industries
are shown in Figure 1 as reported in the 1993 TRI. Formaldehyde
and phenol releases are found mostly within SIC 2493 and 2435
which manufacture plywood and particle board. These materials are
components of the glues and resins used in manufacturing. The
majority of other chemicals are paint-related solvents released
by SIC codes 2511, 2521, and 2431. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>FIGURE 1 - 1993 TRI RELEASES BY THE
GEORGIA WOOD PRODUCTS MANUFACTURING SECTOR (Pounds)</strong></p>
<p align="center"><img src="wood1.gif" width="412" height="265"></p>
<p><strong>Non-Toxic Solvents</strong> </p>
<p>Non-toxic solvents such as mineral spirits are not reported on
the TRI, but are used in coating and gluing operations. They are
significant as volatile organic compounds (VOC) that are
photoreactive and contribute to ground level ozone pollution. The
toxic chemical releases shown in Table 3 are mostly VOCs and also
contribute to ground level ozone pollution. Exact amounts of VOC
releases are unknown from the wood products industry. From
sealing, staining, and coating operations, total VOC emissions
including TRI reportable chemicals ranged from 0.03 to 0.05
pounds per square foot of coated surface with at least 200,000
square feet coated per year. This figure is based on two
facilities where estimations were possible. This information is
summarized in Tables 4 and 5. Additional VOCs are released from
the wood itself in situations where wood is chipped or
significant wood dust is formed, and is in the range of 0.5
pounds per ton of wood. A large amount of wood has to be chipped
before emissions are significant. </p>

<p><strong>Hazardous Waste</strong> </p>
<p>Reported hazardous waste is primarily generated from cleaning
paint guns and related equipment. Rags and wipes used to apply
stain are also disposed of as hazardous waste and reported by
LQGs. Many smaller businesses also generate and dispose of these
wastes as hazardous, but fall below reporting quantities. Rags
from applying solvent-based stain are sometimes disposed of as
solid, nonhazardous waste by manufacturers. Hazardous waste
generation by nonreporting companies could not be estimated since
records were often not maintained. </p>
<p><strong>Particulate Emissions </strong></p>
<p>Dust or particulate emissions to the air from sanding or
sawing operations will become significant under Title V air
quality regulations. Some wood products manufacturers who are not
currently regulated will become Major Sources due to particulate
emissions. Many of these manufacturers are not well informed on
environmental regulations and do not have the in-house technical
skills to handle regulatory matters. </p>
<p><strong>Storm Water</strong> </p>
<p>Storm water may be affected by sawdust and sanding dust that
escapes as fugitive releases or from dust collection systems.
This material was obviously present on the ground around some
wood products manufacturers visited. Storm water contamination
with wood dust is not likely to cause long term problems such as
ground water contamination, but can prompt complaints from
neighbors, block storm drains, and foul standing water. </p>
<p><strong>Solid Waste</strong> </p>
<p>Sawdust, short offcuts, knots, and sanding dust create a very
costly disposal problem for large and small industries. Much of
this material is disposed of in landfills. The companies visited
with 50 to 150 employees generated between 80 and 180 cubic yards
of solid waste per week. Disposal costs ranged from $1,500 to
$5,500 per month. Depending upon the business, the nature of
solid waste changed. Furniture manufacturers, cabinet
manufacturers, and similar businesses tended to generate sawdust
and offcuts of varying sizes as the largest portion of solid
waste. Prefabricated housing manufacturers generate wood waste
also, but a greater percentage consists of packaging waste and
nonwood building materials such as gypsum, foam panels, and paper
products. </p>

<h3><a name="P2">Pollution Prevention in the Wood Products
Industry Barriers, Sources of Assistance, and Waste Reduction

<p>The survey of Georgia wood products manufacturers collected
information on common waste reduction methods, pollution
prevention barriers, and sources of pollution prevention
assistance. Table 6 reports barriers to pollution prevention
identified by the survey. Table 7 lists the sources of assistance

    <li>The only specific regulatory barrier identified was
        related to hazardous waste management. </li>
</ul>
<p>Small and large companies may see an economic advantage by
allowing rags that are wet with solvent to air dry to avoid
having to dispose of them as hazardous waste. If the rags are
properly stored in air-tight containers to prevent air emissions,
the company must ship them off-site as hazardous waste at $100 to
more than $500 per drum. The solvent is then recovered or
properly disposed. By allowing them to dry, air emissions are
increased, but disposal cost is minimized. Companies that are
doing a good job in handling solvent-wet rags are thus penalized. </p>

        the most common sources. </li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that approximately two-thirds of the
responding companies reported having received no assistance in
reducing waste and two-thirds reported significant barriers to
pollution prevention. The most common sources of assistance were
sources that have easy access to manufacturers. Vendors and
corporate experts typically know their products well, but may be
unable to inform companies of other available technologies used
by other industries. External organizations can help a company
overcome barriers by identifying sources of waste and methods to
reduce waste and cost. Government programs, university programs,
and trade associations can provide this type of information at
little or no cost. Consultants can provide this information plus
more detailed design for a fee. Trade organizations exist for the
benefit of industry and offer a wide range of services from
information on laws that apply to their industry to new and
innovative technologies. Since many wood products manufacturers
are comfortable working with vendors, providing vendors with
pollution prevention information may be one way of assisting
these manufacturers. The benefit to the vendors would be enhanced
service to their wood products customers. </p>
<p>Companies that have received help from external sources
identified two major impediments to pollution prevention. Those
are lack of economic feasibility (53%) and limited in-house
expertise (46%). Those that had received help from vendors and
corporate resources only evenly identified all barriers
identified in Table 6 equally at approximately 20%. Manufacturers
that have received no assistance also reported the barriers
listed in Table 6 equally. This would tend to indicate that some
of the concerns of reducing product integrity, technology
limitations, and regulatory noncompliance can be reduced if
companies use external assistance sources. There may be other
explanations as well. The concern of limited in-house expertise
is demonstrated clearly in the majority of the companies visited
by the lack of engineering resources. </p>

<p><strong>Waste Reduction Methods</strong> </p>
<p>The methods used to reduce waste are listed in Table 8. Almost
all companies reported minimizing waste in some manner. Plant
visits did not identify any unique inventory control, energy
conservation, or external recycling methods. Energy conservation
primarily consisted of turning off equipment when not in use or
using natural lighting. Larger facilities with boilers did
recover steam condensate and cleaned boilers to improve energy
efficiency. The most common method was reported to be inventory
control. External recycling of waste primarily consisted of
recycling steel packing material, cardboard, and aluminum cans,
but not process wood waste which is often the largest waste
stream. Several companies did recycle wood on-site by burning for
energy recovery in wood-fired boilers. External recycling markets
do exist for wood waste. The most unique waste reduction activity
noted was substituting plywood for hardwood in a furniture
framing operation to reduce waste. This is discussed later in
this document under Solid Waste Reduction. </p>
<p>Visits also indicated that very few of these manufacturers
have formal waste reduction programs in their facilities. While
very interested in reducing cost and waste, few companies
evaluate waste reduction opportunities using organized methods.
Most companies can be characterized as having an informal
approach to pollution prevention. These companies react to
problems and vendor suggestions, but seldom actively assess waste
reduction opportunities in their facilities. In general, the only
companies having formal plans are hazardous waste LQGs that are
required by law in Georgia to have a hazardous waste reduction
plan. The companies visited that are LQGs report either reduction
or attempted reduction of hazardous waste. </p>

        <p>Bassett Furniture in Dublin, Georgia, produces high
        quality bedroom furniture. The process consists of
        shaping and assembly of hardwood components. Sealant,
        stain, and a clearcoat are applied. Some surfaces are
        inadvertently scratched during handling and processing.
        Scratches are repaired by removing the scratched finish
        with acetone. The surface is then refinished. This
        process generates hazardous waste from stripping the
        finish. Bassett Furniture has implemented a formal
        hazardous waste reduction plan. Their goal is to reduce
        disposal and generation of hazardous waste. Teams of
        Bassett employees evaluate the causes of hazardous waste
        generation and look for ways to reduce. As a result of
        this process, methods were found to reduce scratching of
        the furniture, thus eliminating the need to strip and
        refinish furniture. Basset teams also found ways to reuse
        solvent from coating line flushing. Instead of being
        disposed of as a hazardous waste, the cleaning solvent is
        directly used to thin coatings of the same color to their
        required consistency. Hazardous waste, disposal cost,
        rework labor, and raw material purchases have all been
        reduced. To date, hazardous waste has been reduced by
        60%. Bassett Furniture attributes this success not to the
        technology used, but to implementing a formal waste
        reduction plan.</p>

<h3><a name="P2 Issues">Key Pollution Prevention Issues</a> </h3>
<p>The following key issues were identified during the wood
products manufacturing assessment. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Lack of Facility Pollution Prevention Programs </li>
    <li>Lack of Engineering Resources </li>
    <li>Waste Generation from Spray Application of Coatings </li>
    <li>VOC Emissions from Solvent-based Coatings </li>

</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Facility ">Lack of Facility Pollution Prevention
Programs</a> </h3>
<p>Very few Georgia wood products manufacturers have formal
pollution prevention programs. In general, only hazardous waste
large quantity generators have pollution prevention plans.
Without planning or having a means of evaluating waste
generation, basic problems go unrecognized. The facilities that
did evaluate waste generation and cost have reduced waste. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Engineering ">Lack of Engineering Resources</a> </h3>
<p>Very few Georgia wood products manufacturers have an
engineering staff to handle product, process, and environmental
issues. Larger manufacturers do have such resources or contract
with outside firms. The lack of engineering resources may be an
impediment in bringing new technologies to the production
process. Also, environmental compliance may be impaired without
engineering resources. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Spray">Waste Generation from Spray Application of
Coatings</a> </h3>
<p><strong>Industrial Users of Spray Application of Coatings</strong> </p>
<p>Spray application of coatings is used by manufacturers that
finish wood surfaces with paint, sealant, stain, and lacquer.
Based on survey results, spray coating methods are used by
manufacturers of finished furniture, cabinets, prefabricated
construction, and millwork. As many as 300 Georgia manufacturers
spray coat wood products, but not all do so as a primary process.
Furniture manufacturers may coat 100% of their production while a
company that builds manufactured housing spray applies coating
very infrequently. </p>
<p><strong>Waste Generation </strong></p>
<p>Wastes generated from a spray coating process are commonly
solvents released to the air during painting or as the coating
dries. Solvents are also used in cleaning painting equipment
which releases solvents to the air and generates hazardous waste.
Solvents released to the air from painting and cleanup include
xylene, toluene, MEK, methanol, MiBK, naphtha, mineral spirits,
and alcohols. </p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Spray Application Processes</strong> </p>
<p>Appearance is the reason that spray application of coatings is
used to finish wood products. All manufacturers visited achieved
very good appearance of their finished wood products while using
manual spray application methods of coating. Automation of
coating application is apparently rare in the wood products
industry. </p>
<p>Furniture and other wood surfaces are coated with sealants,
stains, clearcoats, or lacquers applied in a paint booth. Paint
booth operators typically use a spray gun to apply coating on a
production line where a number of identical finished wood
products are coated in sequence. The number of painting stations
varied in plants visited from 30 paint guns to one. Even though
appearance is universally very good, spray techniques used by the
paint booth operators are consistently very poor from a waste
reduction aspect. </p>
<p><strong>Equipment</strong> </p>
<p>The most common paint spray guns used are either conventional
high pressure (HP) or high volume, low pressure (HVLP) guns. HP
guns spray a number of different coatings very well, but are not
as efficient as HVLP guns. Transfer efficiency (TE) is a term
used in painting to describe coating efficiency. A TE of 40%
means that 40% of the paint sprayed sticks to the workpiece
surface and 60% is lost as overspray. </p>
<p>Characteristics of Conventional High Pressure Systems: </p>
<ul>
    <li>TE is up to 40% if used properly. </li>
    <li>Cost ranges from $50 to $300 per gun. </li>
    <li>Spray applies a wide range of materials well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Characteristics of High Volume-Low Pressure Systems: </p>
<ul>
    <li>TE is 65% if used properly. </li>
    <li>Cost ranges from $200 to $700. </li>
    <li>HVLP guns require more consistent coatings. </li>
    <li>Very thick coatings may not atomize properly. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Train Operators to Use Correct Spray Techniques</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Spray techniques are the most important aspect of minimizing
waste from spray coating. High efficiency equipment will provide
low TE if poor application techniques are used. Some companies
reported that switching from HP to HVLP guns provided no
reduction in coating usage. When the process was observed, poor
techniques were consistently used by spray operators. Poor
techniques can reduce the TE to less than 20% regardless of the
type of gun and increase operating cost by 50% or more. Proper
spray techniques include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Triggering the spray gun only when pointed at the
        workpiece </li>
    <li>Maintaining the gun nozzle at the correct distance from
        the workpiece </li>
    <li>Moving the gun parallel to the surface at a consistent
        speed with a 50% pattern overlap </li>
    <li>Using the proper spray pattern for the width of the
        workpiece </li>
    <li>Using the manufacturers recommended system settings for
        pressure and coating consistency </li>
</ul>

        <p>Ethan Allen has a training program for spray operators
        that utilizes video taping as a operator training tool.
        The training consists of three stages:</p>
        <p>1 - Operators are video taped while performing their
        job (it is important to communicate the purpose of the
        taping to the operators before video taping starts so
        that there are no misunderstandings).</p>
        <p>2 - The operators in groups of three along with their
        supervisors and technical personnel, review the tapes in
        one hour sessions in order to identify ways to improve.
        Instruction on spray techniques is provided during the
        session and follow-up is provided during production on
        the manufacturing floor.</p>
        <p>3 - The operators are taped again and given a chance
        to compare the tapes and observe the improvements.</p>
        <p>The training is conducted twice a year and equipment
        and coating suppliers provide technical assistance. The
        company projects saving $50,000 to $70,000 annually as a
        result of 8 - 10% savings in material usage. Wastes and
        VOC emissions are also reduced.</p>

    <li><strong>Use HVLP Spray Guns</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>HVLP guns should be used whenever possible to reduce air
emissions, paint usage, and cost. HVLP guns will provide high TE
if properly used. Newer generations of HVLP guns are less
expensive and more durable than earlier models. Paint usage can
be reduced by 30% by switching from HP to HVLP guns. HVLP guns
can pay for themselves after spraying only 40 gallons of coating. </p>

    <li><strong>For Non-critical Coatings, Use Other Methods
        Besides Spray Application</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Non-critical surfaces, areas where surface protection is more
important than appearance can be roller or brush coated. TE for
direct application methods can approach 100%. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Wiping Stains Can be Applied With a Sponge,
        Brush, Rag, or Roller Instead of Sprayed</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Traditionally, stains were applied directly. Stains are
designed to soak into wood and usually require a top coat such as
varnish to improve appearance and durability. Spraying may offer
no appearance advantage in operations where wiping follows
spraying. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Consider Alternative Spray Methods </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Airless guns can provide high transfer efficiency when
applying thick materials. Some companies can reduce thinning of
coating as well by using airless spray guns. High TE (40% to 65%)
can reduce the volume of coating used. The results are lower
operating cost, reduced energy cost since compressed air is not
required, reduced environmental release of solvents, and reduced
worker exposure. Spray methods are also available that use
liquefied carbon dioxide to replace solvents. </p>
<p>Airless spray systems often using heated coating are sometimes
used by wood finishers. These systems offer high transfer
efficiency and high quality appearance. Transfer efficiency is
estimated to be at least as high as HVLP systems. The following
case study compares two wood finishing shops each sealing,
staining, and applying clear topcoats to wood. One shop uses HVLP
guns and the other uses an airless heat assisted system. </p>

        <p align="center"><strong>Case Study -- Airless Spray
        Guns Applying Heated Coating in a Cabinet Shop</strong></p>
        <p>A cabinet manufacturer in the metro Atlanta area uses
        an airless spray system to apply lacquers and top coats.
        The system uses a high pressure pump to supply coating to
        the paint gun at up to 3,000 pounds per square inch. The
        coating is also heated to reduce viscosity. Coating
        atomization takes place through an orifice in the gun
        nozzle without the use of compressed air. The coated
        cabinet components are then air dried. The coating does
        not require excessive thinning or use of solvent to
        overcome quality problems. A total of 330 gallons lacquer
        thinner are used for equipment cleaning and some
        thinning. The average VOC content of all coating sprayed
        is 5.4 pounds per gallon including thinning and clean-up
        solvent.</p>
        <p>The total amount of coating spray applied is 1,150
        gallons coating 270,000 square feet, or each gallon coats
        235 square feet. In another wood finishing shop using
        HVLP spray guns applying similar coatings, 3,441 gallons
        are applied coating 350,000 square feet or each gallon
        coats only 102 square feet. Coating application using
        airless spray guns reduces coating usage by approximately
        56% or 1,497 gallons annually. Assuming an average cost
        of $10 per gallon for the coatings, estimated savings are
        $14,970. VOC usage for the shop using HVLP guns was 0.05
        pounds per square feet of coated surface compared to 0.03
        pounds per square feet for the shop using airless guns, a
        decrease of 40%. HVLP guns do have good transfer
        efficiency; some of the difference between these two
        finishing shops is probably due to the expertise of
        painters applying the coatings.</p>

<h3><a name="Coatings">VOC Emissions from Solvent-based Coatings</a> </h3>
<p><strong>Industrial Users of Solvent-based Coatings for Wood
Finishing </strong></p>
<p>Manufacturers of finished furniture, cabinets, and millwork
are the primary users of solvent-based coatings. From a user
perspective, solvent in solvent-based coatings allows quick
drying time, and reduced viscosity for better atomization in a
paint spray gun. Both of these features allow for increased
productivity and easy, high-quality application not requiring
highly skilled painters. </p>
<p><strong>Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<p>Waste generated from using solvent-based coatings are commonly
solvents released to the air during painting or as the coating
dries. Solvents are also used in cleaning painting equipment
which releases solvents to the air and generates hazardous waste.
Solvents released to the air from painting and cleanup include
xylene, toluene, MEK, methanol, MiBK, naphtha, mineral spirits,
and alcohols. </p>
<p><strong>Common Characteristics </strong></p>
<p>Most manufacturers air-dry coated products; solvent-based
coatings are well suited for air drying since they are mostly
solvent by weight. Most coatings are less than 35% solids.
Solvent-based coatings include sealants, stains, and lacquer. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Opportunities</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Water-based or High-solids Coatings</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Two common methods to reduce solvent usage are to use
water-based or high-solids coatings. Characteristics of
high-solids and water-based coatings are listed below. </p>
<p>High-solids Coatings: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Greater than 35% solids. </li>
    <li>Reduce solvent emissions. </li>
    <li>Increased coverage per gallon. </li>
    <li>Have increased viscosity.</li>
    <li>Quality problems possible: excessive thickness, runs. </li>
</ul>
<p>Water-based Coatings: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Common as a house paint. </li>
    <li>Water-based lacquers are uncommon. </li>
    <li>Quality problems: durability, pealing, gloss, runs, etc. </li>
    <li>Coating contains solvent; majority is replaced with
        water. </li>
    <li>Drying ovens are often required. </li>
</ul>
<p>Using high-solids coatings is a cost-effective method to
reduce solvent usage, emissions, and worker exposure. Heating the
coating prior to spraying can reduce viscosity, thus reducing
quality problems such as heavy coating, runs, and sags. Use of
airless spray systems can also reduce some quality problems
encountered when spraying high-solids coatings. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Water-based Coatings for Non-critical
        Surfaces</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some companies use water-based paints for non-critical
surfaces such as cabinet interiors. These house paint products
offer reduced solvent, good durability, easy roller application,
and easy clean-up. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Investigate Water-based Top-coat and Lacquers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Although rare, some companies have switched to water-based
coatings for clear top coats. A case study describing Geiger
Brickel's experience with switching to a water-based top coat is
provided below. </p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
    <tr>
        <td width="100%">
        <p align="center"><strong>Case Study -- GEIGER BRICKEL,
        ATLANTA, GA</strong></p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Water-based Topcoat Replaces
        Solvent-based Topcoat</strong></p>
        <p>Geiger Brickel, a manufacturer of high-quality office
        furniture has switched from solvent-based top coats on
        vertical surfaces to water-based clear top coats.
        Vertical surfaces are coated using manual spray methods
        and conventional high pressure spray guns. The coated
        surfaces are then dried in forced air ovens. The result
        is a decrease in solvent emissions by 25 tons per year.
        Furniture tops are still coated with solvent-based top
        coat due to improved durability. The greatest challenge
        in switching to water-based lacquer was finding the
        correct formulation. Geiger worked closely with a vendor
        to develop a coating to meet strict quality requirements.
        This project was partially funded under a grant from P<sup>2</sup>AD.</p>
        <p>The clear top coat previously used on vertical
        surfaces was a two-part urethane coating with a VOC
        content of 5.9 pounds per gallon. The new water-based top
        coat is also a two-part urethane coating with an
        isocyanate catalyst. The cost of the water-based topcoat
        is approximately 50% more per gallon than the
        solvent-based top coat. Overall, significant cost
        reductions were realized considering the water-based
        coating has proven in application to provide two to three
        times more coverage than the solvent-coating. On a per
        gallon basis, the water-based coating contains 0.32
        pounds per gallon instead of 5.9. On the basis of
        coverage, the water-based top coat contains 0.5 pounds
        per 1,000 square feet compared to 30 pounds per 1,000
        square feet for the solvent-based coating. The benefits
        of converting to a water-based coating for Geiger Brickel
        are reduced VOC emissions by approximately 25 tons
        annually, and reduced cost of coating by approximately
        40%.</p>
        <p>Some aspects of this project increased operating
        costs. Additional forced drying capacity was required
        increasing energy costs. Steel paint containers and cups
        were replaced with more costly stainless steel. Total
        costs including research, testing, and rework were
        approximately $302,000. Rework due to early test failures
        was the largest portion totaling $200,000.</p>
        <p>From a performance perspective, the water-based
        coating is comparable to the solvent-based coating. The
        following chart lists some important parameters.</p>

<h3><a name="Adhesives ">VOC Emissions from Solvent-based Contact
Adhesives </a></h3>
<p><strong>Industrial Users of Contact Adhesives </strong></p>
<p>Contact adhesives are used by cabinet and furniture
manufacturers to bond melamine surfaces to particleboard
subsurfaces to provide durable kitchen countertops and work
surfaces. </p>
<p><strong>Waste Generation </strong></p>
<p>Solvent emissions to air are the most common waste stream.
Solvents can represent over 80% of the adhesive by weight, and
are commonly hexane, MEK, and toluene which are hazardous air
pollutants. Toluene is another common adhesive solvent. Depending
upon the application method, cleanup of equipment can generate
hazardous waste, but in small quantities. </p>
<p><strong>Common Characteristics of Contact Adhesive Laminating</strong> </p>
<p>The melamine surface is purchased in rectangular sheets to
match countertop widths. This material is also cut in thin strips
and bonded to the countertop edges. A complete coating of
adhesive is applied to both surfaces and allowed to partially
dry. The glued surfaces are then placed face to face and air
bubbles are rolled from beneath the laminate. The same contact
adhesive is used to provide bonding to both the wide surface
(representing 10 to 20 square feet) and the narrow edge
(representing only 20 square inches). Failure of either surface
can occur, but it occurs more commonly on the narrow edge since a
small air bubble or delamination represents a much greater
percentage of the bonded surface. </p>
<p>The contact adhesive in common use is pink or red in color,
and available as solvent-based or water-based. The solvent-based
adhesive is approximately 85% solvent containing MEK, toluene,
acetone, and hexane. Some of the water-based adhesives contained
the chlorinated solvents methylene chloride or
1,1,1-trichloroethylene, but overall contained less solvent.. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Apply Adhesive with a Roller or Brush to Reduce
        Adhesive Usage</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Two methods of applying adhesive, application with either a
disposable paint roller or high-pressure spray paint gun were
noted during plant visits to wood products manufacturers. Spray
application of adhesive can result in wasting 60% of the adhesive
due to bounce-back. The adhesive bounces off of the surface and
falls to the floor. A comparison is provided below. </p>
<p>Application with high-pressure spray gun: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Transfer efficiency is less than 35%. </li>
    <li>Heavy build-up of overspray on floor and booth.</li>
    <li>Even application to surface is simple. </li>
    <li>60% increase in adhesive cost due to overspray loss.</li>
    <li>Increased energy cost due to compressed air usage.</li>
    <li>Periodic gun cleaning is required. </li>
</ul>
<p>Application with a disposable paint roller:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Transfer efficiency is very high, resulting in decreased
        cost. </li>
    <li>No overspray, reduced facility cleaning.</li>
    <li>Decreased worker exposure to air emissions. </li>
    <li>No use of compressed air, decreased energy costs.</li>
    <li>Little clean-up is required. </li>
    <li>Roller cover is disposed after use each day. </li>
    <li>Used roller cover could be hazardous waste. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Switch to Water-based Adhesive</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Companies that have switched to or are investigating
water-based contact adhesive are doing so for environmental and
safety reasons. A major concern is performance. One company that
uses solvent-based adhesive reported that water-based adhesives
failed on narrow edge laminates during testing, but they were
testing other water-based adhesives for better performance.
Another company had totally switched to water-based adhesives and
reported no significant increase in failures. Drying time for
water-based adhesives is greater than solvent-based. Water-based
adhesives do contain a lesser amount of solvents, but still
contain solvents that are considered toxic or hazardous. </p>
<p>There are a large number of different formulations available
from many manufacturers. Selecting an adhesive that works in a
particular situation requires evaluation considering safety,
environmental, and functional aspects. If an adhesive meets
functional requirements such as strength and ease of application,
the adhesive can be compared on a waste reduction basis.
Adhesives can be evaluated as follows: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Total solvent or VOC content - goal is lowest. </li>
    <li>Total amount of toxic materials - goal is lowest. </li>
    <li>Flash point - goal is highest. </li>
    <li>Coverage per gallon - goal is highest.</li>
    <li>Cost per square foot of coverage - goal is lowest. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other technologies are available and can be evaluated on a
similar basis. Some companies report using hot-melt glue and
white polyvinyl acetate (PVA) thermal cure glues for melamine and
wood laminates instead of contact adhesive. </p>
<p><strong>Other Pollution Prevention Options</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li>It is not necessary to use the same adhesive on wide and
        narrow surfaces. A high-strength solvent-based adhesive
        may be required on a narrow edge, while a water-based
        adhesive may perform well on the wider surface. A 10
        square foot surface bonded with a low strength glue
        capable of withstanding a force of 2 pounds per square
        inch has a total resistance to force of 2,880 pounds. A
        high strength glue may not be needed. On a narrow edge
        with 10 square inches of area, the low-strength glue will
        provide a resistance of only 20 pounds; a higher strength
        glue is probably needed. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Evaluate other technologies such as hot-melt and PVA
        glues.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Evaluate mechanical fastening techniques such as nails,
        pins, screws, and specialty brackets. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Construction ">VOC Emissions from Solvent-based
Construction Adhesives</a> </h3>
<p><strong>Industrial Uses of Construction Adhesives</strong> </p>
<p>Construction adhesives are used to bond wood to other
construction materials such as drywall, foam panels, or metal.
Use of these adhesives are common in the mobile home,
prefabricated construction, and home building industries. </p>
<p><strong>Waste Generation </strong></p>
<p>In the mobile home industry, 90 to 100 pounds of construction
adhesive can be used to build a 1,500 square foot double-wide
construction. This material is usually supplied in 29 ounce tubes
used in caulk guns. Building a single mobile home can generate
over 50 empty tubes which would fill a 55 gallon drum. Tubes are
often disposed of as solid waste, but are probably hazardous if
they still contain adhesive. </p>
<p>There are a number of types of construction adhesives
available and often contain solvents such as acetone, hexane, and
toluene. These solvents are released to the air as the adhesive
dries; some are hazardous air pollutants. </p>
<p><strong>Common Characteristics</strong> </p>
<p>Construction adhesives are usually supplied in a tube and
applied with a caulk gun. The adhesives are very viscous to
prevent running. They are usually used in situations where
additional fastening methods are used. The adhesive is applied
and a nail or screw is used to force the two surfaces together.
They provide strength, flexibility, sealing, and bonding to a
wide variety of materials. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Switch to a Water-based Construction Adhesive</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Water-based and solvent-based adhesives are available from a
number of different manufacturers. PVA products are available
that contain little or no solvent at a comparable cost to the
more common solvent-based adhesives. Vendors report that these
materials work as well as the solvent-based adhesives, but are
not used by most customers. Construction adhesives only need to
be viscous and dry to a moderate strength since they are usually
used in conjunction with nails or screws. Water-based, latex, or
PVA construction adhesives should be as easy to use as
solvent-based, and provide the same performance. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purchase the Adhesive in Bulk</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Construction adhesives are available in different packages
such as cans, tubes, drums, and totes. Purchasing the material in
drums or totes will require the purchase of a pump or other
distribution equipment, but will eliminate disposal of empty,
potentially hazardous tubes if the containers are returned to the
vendor for refill. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Solid Waste ">Solid Waste Generation</a> </h3>
<p><strong>Processes Generating Solid Waste</strong> </p>
<p>All wood products manufacturers produce some wood waste.
Sanding wood will produce sander dust. Sawing, milling, and
turning will produce sawdust and chips. Trimming boards will
produce short offcuts. Knots and other flaws are often removed
producing additional offcuts. These materials are often disposed
of in landfills or burned for energy recovery. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sawdust, Sander Dust, and Machining Dust</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few basic methods of reducing type of waste.
Purchasing wood dimensionally close to the needed size will
reduce the number of cuts and the amount of material removed by
sanding or milling. Reduced material removal will reduce saw,
sander, and machining dust. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Offcuts </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Short and damaged boards are common wastes that are disposed.
Purchasing material with fewer flaws and of consistent width and
length will reduce waste. Reusing offcuts and damaged material to
manufacture other products can reduce waste sent to landfills.
Offcuts can also be recycled by sending waste material to other
manufacturers to be used as a fuel or raw material. Several
methods are listed below that are used by wood products
manufacturers to reduce waste. </p>
<p>Cuts are planned to obtain the most usable material from each
board. Offcuts are used to make nailer blocks, spacers, and
braces, sometimes replacing purchased steel products. Scrap solid
wood is joined with PVA glues in a heated press to form butcher
block surfaces. Short boards are end joined with finger joints to
form boards of usable length. Composites such as plywood or
particle board are substituted for solid wood products to reduce
scrap caused by knots, splitting, and other flaws. </p>

        Material Substitution</strong></p>
        <p>Gailey Manufacturing of Americus, Georgia,
        manufactures upholstered furniture with wood and metal
        frame construction. Hardwood was used to assemble the
        majority of the upholstered frames. Strength is critical
        in building high quality furniture; flaws such as cracks
        were removed from hardwood board before use. As much as
        40% of all hardwood was scrapped due to defects. Some of
        this scrapped material was still usable to construct
        butcher block surfaces after the defect was removed; the
        remaining wood was disposed of in the county landfill at
        the rate of 80 cubic yard per month costing $4,320
        annually. </p>
        <p>Plywood could achieve and exceed the strength
        requirements. Plywood costs significantly more than the
        hardwood used per board foot, and special cutting
        equipment requiring a large investment would be needed
        for cutting to the correct shape. Evaluating the process
        using tests indicated that the raw material scrap rate
        would be reduced to 2% from 40%, reducing waste volume
        and the amount of material purchased. Gailey made the
        switch to plywood. Overall operating cost of this process
        is now reduced by 50% with decreased wood waste. Disposal
        costs will reduce to approximately $180 annually. </p>

    <li><strong>Waste Wood Recyclers </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are alternatives to disposal in a landfill. Some wood
products manufacturers, saw mills, lumber yard, and drying kiln
operators burn wood as a fuel. Some saw mill operators will
return ship sawdust from their customers after delivering lumber.
Some pulp mills will accept wood waste. Particleboard and
paneling manufacturers can also use this material to manufacture
these products. </p>
<p>Kiln operations found at lumber yards, furniture
manufacturers, and saw mills need wood waste for fuel. Paneling
and particleboard manufacturers can use wood waste for fuel and
raw material. Boiler operations found at pulp, paper, and other
forest product mills often purchase wood waste for fuel. </p>
<p>The keys to finding and keeping a recycler include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Treat wood for recycling as a valuable product, not
        waste. </li>
    <li>Wood must be kept clean, dry, and unmixed with waste. </li>
    <li>Do not mix reconstituted woods (particleboard, plywood,
        strandboard, paneling) with solid wood. </li>
    <li>Do not mix pine with hardwood unless your recycler knows
        and can accept the material. </li>
    <li>Do not mix sawdust with large pieces of wood unless your
        recycler can accept the material. </li>
    <li>Do not mix treated and coated wood with solid wood waste. </li>

<h3><a name="Assistance">Pollution Prevention Assistance Needs of
the Wood Products Manufacturing Sector </a></h3>
<p><strong>Organizational Needs </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Few Georgia wood products manufacturers have a
        formal method of identifying or evaluating waste
        reduction opportunities.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Several companies contacted indicated that their organization
did actively identify waste reduction methods through evaluation
of waste streams. These companies represent less than 10% of the
total number. The existence of a program was most common among
hazardous waste LQGs since a plan is required by Georgia
environmental regulations. Most of the manufacturers contacted
were interested in reducing waste and cost, but did not have an
active pollution prevention program. Some primary needs of wood
product manufacturers are to implement a pollution prevention
program and to be educated on the benefits of such a program. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Few Georgia wood products manufacturers have an
        engineering or technical staff. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of Georgia wood products manufacturers are small
businesses that are primarily focused on production of a
particular product. Companies with engineering resources are
primarily those with more than 100 employees, or build complex
designs such as prefabricated and trailer mounted housing. New
technologies that benefit the businesses from an engineering
perspective are discovered by the small businesses through
vendors. Trade shows where vendors show and demonstrate new
products were mentioned by several wood products manufacturers as
a primary resource for finding new technologies. Access to
engineering resources is a primary need of small wood products
manufacturers to better evaluate and identify beneficial
technologies. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Most Georgia wood products manufacturers are
        unaware of the various state, federal, and university
        technical assistance programs that can aid in waste
        reduction. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Fewer than 12% of the businesses that responded to the survey
had used either university or government programs to assist in
minimizing waste. Most companies contacted were unaware of the
existence of such programs. Most federal, state, and university
programs can provide information at no cost to the business. Wood
product manufacturers need to be informed of the existence of
technical assistance programs. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Few Georgia wood products manufacturers are
        active with trade associations. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of trade associations available to wood
products manufacturers. There are 73 wood product associations
listed in the National Trade and Professional Associations 1995
directory. Manufactured housing businesses are involved with the
Georgia Manufactured Housing Association. Large particleboard,
plywood, and veneer manufacturers tend to be members of various
trade organizations. In general, the small manufacturer is not a
member of any trade organization. There are only 4 companies in
Georgia that are member of the National Furniture Manufacturers
Association. The Hardwood Plywood and Veneer Association has
approximately 8 members in Georgia. Several companies contacted
indicated that they were active with the local Chamber of
Commerce. Wood products manufacturers could benefit from becoming
active members of trade organizations by taking advantage of the
technical, educational, and regulatory programs offered by the
associations. </p>
<p><strong>Technical Needs </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Waste reduction could be realized in solvent
        emissions by some relatively simple methods that would
        result in significant cost reduction. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There is an overall lack of awareness of new technologies in
the Georgia wood products industry. This is caused by several
factors such as a lack of engineering resources, little or no
activity within trade organizations, and the lack of either
formal or informal waste reduction programs. Some simple
solutions to these technology gaps are listed below. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Training of employees who spray apply coatings.</li>
    <li>Education on various spray application technologies such
        as HVLP, airless, electrostatic, etc. </li>

        water-based.</li>
    <li>Education on alternative low-VOC glues and adhesives.</li>
    <li>Education on how to use existing waste recyclers.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Technology Research Needs </strong></p>
<p>The previous pages addressed common technologies that have
potential waste reduction opportunities encountered in the wood
products industry. The information presented provides a statement
of the type of technology used, the level of expertise at which
it is used, and ways to reduce waste. Not all processes and
technologies used by wood product manufacturers are discussed.
Some of the common processes are universally done well and have
very few health or environmental concerns. Research may be needed
to reduce emissions from urea and phenol resins, and to further
industrialize water-based coatings for wood products. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Alternatives to Urea and Phenol Formaldehyde
        Resins</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Urea formaldehyde resins are used to manufacture particleboard
and similar materials by bonding wood fibers together. Urea
formaldehyde resins will make up less than 5% of the weight of
the finished wood; the majority of the finished board consists of
wood. These resins do release formaldehyde from processing.
Phenol formaldehyde resins are used to manufacture strandboard
and plywood. The 1993 TRI reported releases from these industries
in Georgia of 167,078 pounds of formaldehyde and 154,780 pounds
of methanol. Methanol is also a component of urea formaldehyde
resins. Phenol emissions in Georgia from these industries were
20,396. Phenol formaldehyde resins seem to contain less methanol,
but are dark in color. The dark color of phenol formaldehyde is
unsuitable for most particle board due to appearance, but is used
internally in plywood manufacture. </p>
<p>There are some companies using various isocyanate resins as an
alternative to either urea or phenol formaldehyde. Isocyanate
resins are an alternative, but typically have a cost disadvantage
when compared to urea or phenol formaldehyde. Isocyanates are
also considered a worker exposure hazard and are reportable on
the TRI. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Alternatives to Solvent-based Coatings </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Water-based clearcoats do exist that can replace solvent-based
materials for high-quality furniture finishing. Current feedback
from industries using water-based clear-coats indicate that they
are slightly less durable. Companies that have switched to
water-based clear-coats have had to absorb large costs associated
with research and equipment investment. Additional research is
needed to further industrialize water-based and other low VOC
coatings that have the high durability of current solvent-based
materials. These materials may exist in other industries. Basic
research and or demonstration projects are needed to make low VOC
technologies available to the small wood products manufacturer.
Some of the water-based coatings in current use also contain
isocyanates. </p>

    <li><strong>Provide Pollution Prevention Training</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Small and large wood products manufacturers will benefit from
education and training of plant management and production staff
on pollution prevention techniques. The ultimate goal is to have
each company conduct pollution prevention assessments, evaluate
results, and implement cost effective solutions. </p>
<p>Due to the large number of manufacturers, one-on-on training
with each company is not practical. Training could be partially
accomplished by conducting workshops in the Atlanta area, and one
or more workshops in each of the other Georgia regions.
Participation of the Chamber of Commerce and various trade
organizations in training activities would enhance the process.
Fact sheets will also be developed for wood products
manufacturers. P<sup>2</sup>AD will develop fact sheets and
design workshop programs as part of existing conferences or as
stand alone presentations. Education and training of vendors that
work with the wood products industry on pollution prevention and
assistance resources are other ways of reaching wood products
manufacturers with beneficial information. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Identify Engineering Resources for Process Design
        and Environmental Services </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Engineering resources are available for small businesses
through EDI's network of regional offices. Georgia Tech Research
Institute (GTRI) also provides engineering services though
regional offices. Services may include information on equipment
selection, manufacturing, and environmental compliance. In order
to take advantage of these services, P<sup>2</sup>AD will provide
descriptions of these and other services available to wood
products manufacturers. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Identify Educational Resources to Provide
        Environmental Regulatory Training </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Identify and Encourage Development of Wood
        Products Trade Organizations </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The above items will require additional research to identify
resources and design programs to meet these needs. </p>
<p><strong>Meeting Technical Needs </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide training on new and standard coating technologies
        and equipment </li>
    <li>Provide training resources for coating and adhesive
        application </li>
    <li>Provide education on alternative coatings and adhesives </li>
</ul>
<p>This information can be distributed in booklet form and
through workshops. P<sup>2</sup>AD will first develop written
information for distribution to wood products manufacturers.
There are several good documents previously published that can
serve as models or that can be distributed without further
editing. Any workshops developed for wood products manufacturers
will include this information. </p>
<p><strong>Meeting Research Needs </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Several trade organizations are active with particleboard
        and plywood manufacturers. These organizations may be
        interesting in supporting research in alternative resins
        and application systems. Applied research projects may be
        necessary to take advantage of previously completed
        research. P<sup>2</sup>AD should seek industrial partners
        in developing research programs. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Applied research or demonstration projects will be
        identified to help bring new coating technologies to wood
        products manufacturers. P<sup>2</sup>AD should seek
        industrial partners for completion of demonstration
        projects. Information gained will be distributed through
        fact sheets and workshops </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Conclusion">Summary and Conclusion </a></h3>
<p>The purpose of this study is to identify the pollution
prevention needs of the Georgia wood products industry. This
information will be used to develop programs within P<sup>2</sup>AD
to address industry needs. A summary of the needs and methods of
meeting needs are listed below. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Significant opportunity does exist within Georgia wood
        products manufacturers to reduce waste. Waste reduction
        has been accomplished at several wood products
        manufacturers by assessing waste generation and
        implementing solutions. P<sup>2</sup>AD can provide the
        greatest assistance by facilitating the development of
        programs in all mills through its technical outreach
        program. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Georgia wood products manufacturers need information to
        replace outdated processes with more efficient
        technologies. P<sup>2</sup>AD can assist by developing
        case studies and fact sheets describing more efficient
        technologies and equipment. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Applied research is needed to industrialized new
        technologies. To a lesser extent, basic research is
        needed. P<sup>2</sup>AD can educate wood products
        manufacturers on various research projects that have
        taken place nationally. Public -- Private partnerships
        should be formed to demonstrated new technologies that
        will reduce pollution. </li>

<h2 align="center">No-Clean Technology </h2>
<p align="center"><strong>By Paul Crumpler, Pollution Prevention
Engineer</strong> </p>
<hr>
<p>You will not find no-clean technology listed in the Yellow
Pages. This is because there is no specific cleaning product to
buy, and vendors sell products. No-clean methods generally
require procedural or design changes that eliminate the need to
clean products during production, and production equipment
between production runs. </p>
<p>An example of converting to a no-clean method is to eliminate
degreasing of a steel component manufactured in a lathe prior to
painting. The degreasing step could be deleted by replacing or
eliminating the use of cooling oil in the machining process. In
this example, the cooling oil could be eliminated by some
combination of a reduction of the machining rate, use of ceramic
or carbide tool inserts, cooling with water only followed by
drying, cooling with air or other compressed gas, or cooling with
a fluid that is compatible with the paint. </p>
<p>Another example is to eliminate cleaning in mixing vats
between production runs by using dedicated mixing vats for each
product or product family. This would require the purchase of
additional mixing vats, but the purchase may have a significant
payback when waste costs are factored into the economic
justification. Waste costs include lost raw material costs, lost
profit on sales of the product, treatment costs, and disposal
costs. </p>
<h3>Assessing The Necessary Level of Cleanliness </h3>
<p>Degreasing in a vapor degreaser followed by shot blasting will
usually provide a steel component with a very clean surface
appropriate for painting. This is an expensive method to assure
cleanliness. The component may have already been clean enough for
painting prior to degreasing or blasting. Vapor degreasing cleans
a dirty component just as well and for the same cost as a clean
component. Excessive cleaning usually cannot be found by
inspection or by function. The only evidence of over cleaning is
in increased waste generation and increased cost. Before
specifying a specific cleaning process, the level of allowable
contamination should be known for the component. </p>
<p>Experiments can be designed to determine the level of
cleanliness required; cleanliness inspection methods can also be
devised. In the above example of a steel component manufactured
on a lathe prior to painting, paint adhesion could be compared
between several parts that were degreased and several that were
not degreased. If adhesion levels do not vary between the two
groups, degreasing is not necessary and can be eliminated. If
adhesion does vary but only in specific locations on the
component, it is important to determine the cause. Contamination
such as cooling oil generally would cause paint to not adhere
consistently over the component. Fingerprints left by workers
during part handling commonly cause spotty paint adhesion.
Instead of degreasing, lathe or paint booth operators may need to
wear gloves. A cleaning and adhesion problem in one manufacturing
plant was found to be hand cream used by several machine
operators. Hand washing, not parts washing, solved the problem.
Components with varying levels of contamination can be painted to
determine the maximum contamination level and type of
contamination that causes paint adhesion or other quality
problems. This information should be communicated to machine
operators or vendors in the form of cleanliness specifications.
If the cleanliness specifications can be achieved without
cleaning, reduced waste and cost can be achieved. Another method
to achieve required paint adhesion without cleaning may be to
switch to a different type of paint. Paint vendors may be able to
supply paint that will provide the required performance without
or with reduced surface cleaning. </p>
<h3>Production Scheduling </h3>
<p>Production scheduling may reduce or eliminate the need to
clean processing equipment between production runs. Production
runs should usually be scheduled so that residues left in
processing equipment from the previous process do not interfere
with the subsequent process. Processes such as painting,
printing, or dyeing should be run with products that use the
exact same colors and chemistries over the course of a day or
shift to reduce cleaning to only the end of the shift. If color
or chemistry changes are needed, colors should be run so that
each production change will result in a darker color used. Run
colors from white to black. Also, run compatible chemistries
together. Avoid changes such as from water-based to oil-based
back to water-based. Rescheduling to run the two oil-based
chemistries back to back could eliminate one cleaning process. Be
aware of temperature changes; processes that run at the same
temperatures should be run consecutively to conserve energy. </p>
<p>Use of dedicated mixing vats was discussed previously as a
method to reduce waste and save money. Assume that a manufacturer
mixes a number of different cleaning agents. When designing the
mixing process, the number of mixing vats will need to be
determined. The manufacturer can determine the most efficient
production schedule and optimize the number of dedicated mixing
vats needed by comparing chemistries and determining which ones
are compatible. Using one mixing vat and cleaning between each
production run may be a waste of resources; using a dedicated
tank for each product may also be a waste of resources. Each of
the product chemistries should be analyzed and grouped for
chemical compatibility. This information can be used to determine
the most efficient production schedule that will minimize cleanup
wastes in the minimum number of dedicated vats. </p>
<h3>Component Design </h3>
<p>Production cleaning should be considered during product
design. Blind holes should be avoided. Holes that are drilled and
tapped into a component should be drilled completely through
where the design allows. Not only are through holes easier to
drill and tap, through holes are easier to clean. Blind holes are
traps for machining residues. Hand wiping and most other cleaning
methods are not effective in removing residues from blind holes.
Typically, blind holes will hold liquid and machining chips.
Machining chips left in internal oil passages will probably not
cause painting or other processing problems. However, residual
machining chips and cooling oil left in internal passages and
other blind holes are among the leading causes of machine failure
in new assemblies. </p>
<p>Alternative materials may be a solution to cleaning. Steel
components may need to be machined, degreased, and painted in
order to meet functional and appearance specifications. Replacing
steel with a colored plastic may eliminate cleaning and painting.
An example can be found on most office desktops. Traditionally,
staple gun exteriors were made of formed steel components that
were painted either beige or black. Today, most staple gun
exteriors are formed of injection molded plastic of the correct
color, thus eliminating the need to form, clean, or paint. </p>
<h3>Production Equipment Design </h3>
<p>Production equipment can also be designed to reduce the need
to clean. Guards should be placed around processes to catch drips
and splatters that would have to be cleaned from the floor.
Funnels and guides can be added to equipment to allow operators
to add dry or wet chemicals without spillage. Internal passages
can be designed so that production chemicals drain into the
process instead of becoming trapped inside the equipment.
Internal passages and external piping should be designed to be as
short as possible to reduce the amount of surface area that may
need to be cleaned between production runs. Drip trays, pans, and
drain boards can be designed as part of equipment to channel
spills back into the process. </p>
<p>Paint spray or glue application guns used to apply two-part
chemicals are often designed so that mixing of the resin and
hardener takes place only in the gun tip. Resin and hardener are
fed to the application gun tip in two tubes instead of being
mixed in a pressure tank or gun cup. This allows the gun tip to
be removed and cleaned at the end of the shift instead of
flushing the hoses and pressure tank. In addition to eliminating
the need to clean a large amount of equipment, this method
reduces the amount of glue or paint wasted to only that very
small volume in the gun tip. A very simple example of this
process is the two-part epoxy syringe packages available in
retail stores. </p>
<p>Non-stick surfaces, such as Teflon or polyethylene, can be
added to production equipment to aid in removal of residues.
Powder coating paint booths typically have very smooth plastic
interior surfaces to prevent the powder from adhering. When
cleanup is required, it can usually be achieved with vacuuming.
Scraper and automated knives in the plastics industry are often
coated with Teflon to prevent adhesion of the resins to the
knives. Paint booths are often coated with paper or strippable
chemical coatings to eliminate the need of using harsh stripping
chemicals during paint cleanup. A very simple example of a
strippable coating is applying a light coating of hydraulic oil
to paint roll coating processing equipment exteriors to prevent
paint splatters from sticking. When dry, the paint falls to the
floor and can be swept into a dust bin. </p>
<h3>Process Water </h3>
<p>No-clean methods also apply to process chemicals such as
water. Typically, water is used one time for rinsing or cooling
prior to disposal. Often, single use of water is a serious waste
of money and natural resources. Rinse water is often clean enough
to reuse many times for rinsing or for cleaning bath makeup
water. Water usage can be reduced by up to 80% in rinse tanks by
using counter flow techniques. In counter flow rinsing or
washing, water flows from one rinse tank to the next opposite of
the direction that the components being washed are moving. In
this way, the dirtiest part comes in contact with the dirtiest
water first. After getting the most out of water for washing or
rinsing, contaminants can be filtered from the water and the
water reused. Some plating and anodizing processors have reduced
or eliminated wastewater discharges by combining water
conservation methods such as counter flow rinsing and filtration.
Common Sense Methods </p>
<p>No-clean methods can be summed up as common sense methods. If
a component is not dirty and it is prevented from becoming
contaminated, then it does not need to be cleaned. Processes and
components should be designed to eliminate or reduce the need in
order to clean to reduce cost and pollution.</p>
<h3>No-clean Check List </h3>
<p>Before cleaning, evaluate the item to be cleaned to determine
the nature of the contamination. Determine what will happen if
contaminants are not removed. Eliminate cleaning if the
contaminants are compatible with the process. If contaminants are
detrimental to the next process or will damage the component,
determine the source of the contamination and correct instead of
cleaning. If detrimental contaminants are residues or chemicals
from a previous process, determine if there are substitute
chemicals available that will not harm the process. Adjust
production schedules so that residues left on production
machinery and products are compatible with next process. If
detrimental contaminants are residues from a previous process,
determine if that process can be eliminated. If contaminants are
detrimental to the next process, determine if the next process
can be altered or eliminated so that contaminants are compatible.
Determine just how clean components need to be in order to
function. Publish cleanliness specifications for each component
or process; do not specify a particular cleaning process.
Evaluate current product design to determine if alternate designs
and materials can meet functional requirements with reduced waste
without cleaning. Remember that no-clean methods also apply to
process chemicals such as water. Use and reuse water efficiently.
Avoid spills and cleanup by installing guards, drip trays, and
proper material handling devices on production equipment. Reduce
the need to clean by using non-stick surfaces and strippable
coatings on production equipment.</p>

<p align="center"><b>MISSION STATEMENT</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Automotive Fluids Work Group</b></p>
<p>Unlike the majority of consumer liquids, in most applications
automotive fluids are not used up and therefore create a disposal
problem for people who perform self-maintenance of their
vehicles. Used oil, leaking oil filters, antifreeze, and other
automotive fluids generated by do-it-yourselfers (DIYs) can be
viewed as being both a potentially harmful threat to Georgia's
natural ecosystems and residents and as a valuable resource that
can be recovered for beneficial reuse in Georgia. </p>
<p>It is estimated that about 19 million gallons of passenger car
motor oil are sold in Georgia annually. Much of this oil is
purchased by DIYs. It is estimated that more than 5.5 million oil
filters are also bought by DIYs each year. Based on national
statistics, as much as five million gallons of used oil may be
improperly disposed of in Georgia annually. There are few places
in Georgia where consumers can take used oil, oil filters,
antifreeze, and other automotive fluids for proper disposal. </p>
<p>The mission of the Automotive Fluids Work Group is to provide
the Director of P<sup>2</sup>AD, by no later than February 28,
1996, recommendations for creating a voluntary, state-sponsored
program that will result in the proper recovery of
consumer-generated used automotive fluids and oil filters.
Recommendations shall identify types of collection sites and
methods, potential sources of program funding, and incentives for
industry and consumers. Recommendations made by the work group
are non-binding. </p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The Automotive Fluids Work Group was created by the Director
of the Pollution Prevention Assistance Division of the Georgia
Department of Natural Resources to recommend guidelines for a
state-sponsored automotive fluids management program. The work
group was made up of citizens representing a cross section of
government, trade associations, automotive fluid recyclers, and
environmental groups. The work group members are: Davis Morgan,
Chair; Ric Cobb, Rick Glendye, Larry Hart/Randy Brillhart, Della
Ridley, Kelley Coty, Carl Ferrans, Jack Kowall, Rick Cothran,
Olin Ivey, Wesley Woolf, and Bernie Deck/Paul Dickison/Steve
Grimshaw. The work group acts in an advisory capacity to the
Director. </p>
<p>The work group's mission was to provide to the Director
recommendations on the creation of a voluntary, state-sponsored
program which will result in proper recovery of
consumer-generated used automotive fluids and oil filters in
Georgia. The work group was provided with a comprehensive
research report which contained detailed information about
automotive fluids and filter management techniques, and state
programs for do-it-yourselfers (DIYs). The work group was then
asked to recommend components of a DIY management program for
Georgia, including types and methods of collection, funding, and
incentives. </p>
<p>To accomplish its mission, the work group met twice. The first
session was devoted to a series of short, informational
presentations by industry experts on various aspects of
automotive fluids management. The work group also brainstormed a
list of major issues to discuss at the next meeting. The second
meeting of the work group was a facilitated session during which
the group narrowed the issues, identified major categories, and
made specific recommendations to P<sup>2</sup>AD's Director. </p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>March 18, 1996</strong></p>
<p>A general recommendation of the work group is that any type of
DIY automotive fluids management program developed by the
Division should be voluntary. No one industry or retail group,
such as service stations, should be singled out to perform
collection of DIY-generated fluids. Rather, any responsible
entity that is interested in participating in the program should
be allowed to do so. The Division should advocate recycling and
collection programs by local governments, retailers, and
non-profits. </p>
<p>The Automotive Fluids Work Group recommends the following, in
no particular order, to be components of the DIY automotive
fluids management program developed by the Division. </p>
<p><em>Category # 1 - Collection of Automotive Fluids and Filters
generated by DIYs</em></p>
<p>The Division should &quot;benchmark&quot; all existing DIY
collection locations and automotive fluid markets within the
state in order to identify areas that may now be under-served by
consumer collection programs or have inadequate capacity for
proper handling of the fluids. Collection should, above all other
things, be convenient to the consumer. Collection locations could
include, but are not limited to, the following: various retailers
such as quick lube shops and full service stations, oil jobbers,
private firms, sites sponsored by local governments or
non-profits, and anyone who sells oil. Collection sites should be
manned. The Division should advertise the location of DIY
collection sites in some way. The Division should also encourage
DIY used automotive fluid collection as part of other existing
recycling programs. </p>
<p><em>Category # 2 - Laws and Legislation</em></p>
<p>The work group states that existing laws affecting used
automotive fluids and filters should be enforced by the proper
authorities, particularly in the case of DIYs. Consumers should
be given some sense of their own liability for improper disposal.
Additionally, the group recommends that P<sup>2</sup>AD should
sponsor legislation to promote antifreeze recycling within
Georgia. If legislation is deemed necessary by the Director to
enable proper management of DIY-generated used oil and other
automotive fluids, model language developed by the American
Petroleum Institute could be used as a starting point for
drafting legislation. </p>
<p><em>Category # 3 - Funding of an Automotive Fluids Management
Program </em></p>
<p>A large amount of funding may not be necessary, as collection
of DIY-generated used automotive fluids is already taking place
in Georgia. However, the work group, in general, supports the
idea of some type of fee on oil to fund a DIY automotive fluids
management program. Any fee collected should be reasonable, not
concentrated on the retailer, and have low administrative costs.
Possible funding sources identified by the work group include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Fee only on small amounts of oil sold (i.e. quarts) </li>
    <li>Fee on oil from first transaction (i.e. entry into the
        state) </li>
    <li>Redirection of state funds from existing programs or
        trust funds</li>
    <li>Combination of user fees and state government money </li>
    <li>Fee on other automotive fluids in addition to oil</li>
    <li>Small fee on yearly vehicle registrations or drivers'
        license renewals </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Category # 4 - Liability</em> </p>
<p>Concerns about liability issues regarding collection of
consumer-generated automotive fluids are problematic. P<sup>2</sup>AD
should attempt to address and clarify legislation and regulation
pertaining to automotive fluids to resolve liability issues. The
work group recommended that some measure be taken to limit
liability for collectors, such as the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Trust fund to ensure limited liability in case of a
        contaminated load of fluids </li>
    <li>Legislative reduction in liability for collectors who
        meet acceptable standards</li>
    <li>More consistent enforcement of fire codes by local
        jurisdictions </li>
    <li>Better education of retail-level collectors </li>
    <li>Production of a guidebook that clearly states regulations
        affecting a used oil collection site </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Category # 5 - Incentives</em> </p>
<p>The work group agrees that at least some retailers now collect
used automotive fluids from DIYs and in the future will continue
to do DIY collection with no additional incentives. Such
retailers now offer collection of used automotive fluids because
it is a good public relations vehicle for their company, and/or
because it increases customer traffic and purchasing in their
stores. Similarly, P<sup>2</sup>AD should determine if incentives
are necessary for the general public to encourage participation. </p>
<p>Incentives identified by the work group for the collectors
include the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Pay collectors an amount per gallon of automotive fluids
        collected, or some percentage rebate of any fee collected
        at the retail level </li>
    <li>Awards program for collectors tied to good business
        practices </li>
    <li>State promotion and advertising for collectors </li>
    <li>Provide money to collectors to purchase a tank so DIY oil
        can be segregated</li>
    <li>Provide money to collection sites based on participation
        rates</li>
    <li>Give money to local governments to purchase collection
        tanks and set up local education programs</li>
    <li>Limitation of liability and/or reduction of regulation,
        as discussed in Category # 4 </li>
</ul>
<p>Incentives identified by the work group for consumers and DIYs
include the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Finder's fee for DIYs who bring in automotive fluids and
        filters to be recycled </li>
    <li>Coupons for money off at local businesses and restaurants</li>
    <li>Giveaway of small amount of oil or discount on purchase
        of oil when DIY brings a certain amount of used oil in
        for collection</li>
    <li>Having convenient collection sites </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Category # 6 - Education</em> </p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should establish a comprehensive education
program to promote collection of used DIY-generated automotive
fluids and filters in the state. The Division should consider
education of consumers, DIYs, retailers, and collectors. However,
education efforts should not take place until there are
sufficient disposal options available. Possible components of an
education program in Georgia are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Simple brochure to educate DIYs about proper disposal of
        used automotive fluids and where they are collected</li>
    <li>Training program in each county </li>
    <li>Video</li>
    <li>1-800 hotline number </li>
    <li>List information in appropriate publications </li>
    <li>Distribute educational information through elementary or
        high schools </li>
    <li>Develop appropriate public service announcements,
        handouts, and posters </li>
    <li>Get a high profile spokesperson (i.e. race car driver) to
        promote proper disposal of automotive fluids </li>
    <li>Privatize or at least partner with private industry to
        promote automotive fluid recycling </li>
    <li>Require signage in all automotive sale areas indicating
        the nearest location for collection of used fluids</li>
    <li>Require labels on automotive fluid containers to have
        information about the state's program</li>
    <li>Adopt an official symbol to denote collection locations
        state-wide</li>
    <li>Give out educational flyers with car tag renewals, at
        auto emission inspection facilities, at point of oil
        sale, at car dealers and car repair shops, or in utility
        bills </li>
    <li>Solicit oil companies to include information about proper
        disposal in their advertising </li>
    <li>Disseminate information about proper disposal during
        driver's education training</li>

<p align="center"><strong>MISSION STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Household Hazardous Waste Work Group</strong></p>
<p>Approximately 2.4 million households in Georgia generate more
than 5.1 million tons of solid waste each year, most of which is
disposed in solid waste landfills. Approximately 0.3 - 0.5
percent of that waste may be hazardous to human health or the
environment (EPA, Proceedings of the 4th National Conference on
Household Hazardous Waste Management, February 1990). In
addition, an unknown quantity of household hazardous waste is
improperly disposed of by pouring into storm drains, dumping on
the ground, etc. A mission of the Pollution Prevention Assistance
Division (P<sup>2</sup>AD) of the Georgia Department of Natural
Resources is to instill within the public a pollution prevention
ethic which is consistent with the protection of human health and
the environment. While hazardous waste generated by households is
exempt from environmental regulations in Georgia, the issue of
how best to properly manage household hazardous products and
reduce waste is of growing concern. Household hazardous wastes of
concern are unused or contaminated consumer products such as
paints, stains, and varnishes; cleaners; pesticides, fungicides,
and herbicides; solvents; used motor oil and other automotive
fluids; and, spent household batteries.</p>
<p>The mission of the Household Hazardous Waste Work Group is to
provide the Director of P<sup>2</sup>AD with recommendations on
the feasibility of a state-sponsored program which will result in
a reduction in household hazardous waste generation in Georgia.
If it recommends that a state-sponsored program should be
established, the Work Group shall propose a list of programs and
activities. Recommendations should include the approximate cost
of implementation. Recommendations made by the work group are
non-binding. To accomplish its mission, the Work Group should
review household hazardous waste reduction and management
programs in other states, evaluate the body of literature on the
subject, and solicit public opinion and comment.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The Household Hazardous Waste Work Group was created by the
Director of the Pollution Prevention Assistance Division of the
Georgia Department of Natural Resources to recommend guidelines
for a state-sponsored Household Hazardous Waste Prevention and
Management (HHWPM) program. The work group acted in an advisory
capacity to the Director.</p>
<p>The work group's mission was to provide to the Director
recommendations on the feasibility of a state-sponsored program
which will result in a reduction in household hazardous waste
(HHW) generation in the state. The work group was asked to review
HHW reduction and management programs in other states and to
evaluate the body of literature on the subject. The work group
was also to recommend a list of actions and activities that could
potentially constitute the development of a state HHWPM program.</p>
<p>To accomplish its mission, the work group was divided into
three smaller study groups. The Issues &amp; Priorities group
focused on the issues of liability, effect of regulations, and
possible funding sources for a state-sponsored HHWPM program. The
Residuals Management group discussed management strategy for HHW
once it enters the waste stream, while the Source Reduction group
focused on education programs for consumers to reduce the amount
of household hazardous products (HHP) entering the waste stream.
These three study groups met a total of nine times over a three
month period. Additionally, the total work group met three times,
and the chair and study group chairs met twice as a small group. </p>
<p>The work group was made up of 15 citizens representing a cross
section of government, trade associations, and environmental
groups. The work group members were Thea Powell, Chair; Rick
Foote, Vice-Chair; Don Cargill, Lynn Cobb, Ric Cobb, Rick
Cothran, Mark Eisen, Steve Emmons, Olin Ivey, Linda Jones, Kathy
Kuzava, Carol Monell, Reuben Sherrill, Susan Varlamoff, and Dee
West.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>September 22, 1995</strong></p>
<p>An overarching recommendation of the work group is that the
Pollution Prevention Assistance Division should be given
responsibility to serve as the lead organization in the state for
household hazardous waste (HHW) matters. The Division should
serve as a state-wide information clearinghouse and coordination
center for HHW, although it should not directly operate HHW
programs. The Division's programs should clearly emphasize the
difference between household hazardous products (HHP) and HHW.
Once the consumer no longer has a need for the product, then it
becomes a waste. Additionally, the Division should adopt the EPA
definition of household hazardous waste, as follows: HHW is A.
generated by individuals on the premises of a residence for
individuals and composed primarily of materials found in the
wastes generated by consumers in their homes, and B. Listed as
hazardous waste in 40 CFR, Parts 261.33 (e) or (f), or hazardous
by characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity,
and/or extraction procedure toxicity.</p>
<p>The HHW Work Group recommends the following, in no particular
order, to be components of the HHW program developed by the
Division.</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 1 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote
legislation to establish a HHW prevention and management program
in Georgia.</h4>
<p>Item # 1 </p>
<p>The Division should promote legislation that will create a
fund to provide financial support to local governments and other
groups in the state who wish to sponsor HHWPM programs. The
funding sources could be any one or a combination of the
following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>landfill tipping fees</li>
    <li>percentage of waste facility receipts </li>
    <li>hazardous waste generator fees</li>
    <li>local government surcharge, i.e. surcharge on water/sewer
        bills</li>
    <li>local government revenue surcharge on selected household
        hazardous products </li>
    <li>donated services.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Division should establish written criteria for grant funds
in support of HHWPM programs. These criteria should encourage the
creation of public/private partnerships, and allow for funds to
be used for stand alone education programs or comprehensive
education/collection programs.</p>
<p>Item # 2</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote legislation that would
encourage inclusion of questions regarding proper HHW
disposal/recycling practices on various types of licensing
renewals in Georgia. For example, a question about used motor oil
recycling could be included on drivers' license renewal forms.</p>
<p>Item # 3</p>
<p>The Division should conduct further investigation into other
state or federal laws regarding labeling of hazardous household
products. The work group agrees that manufacturers are more
likely to respond to a &quot;carrot&quot; rather than a
&quot;stick&quot; approach. Therefore, P<sup>2</sup>AD should
monitor developments regarding labeling laws, and should work
with other states and the EPA Labeling Task Force to encourage
appropriate labeling legislation.</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 2 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop
guidelines for conducting Household Hazardous Waste Prevention
and Management programs.</h4>
<p>These guidelines could be in the form of a document designed
as a comprehensive guidebook for distribution to any organization
interested in sponsoring HHWPM educational and/or collection
programs. The guidebook should recognize that public, private,
and non-profit organizations are capable of sponsoring HHWPM
programs; however, special consideration should be given to
programs that are sponsored or co-sponsored by private entities.</p>
<p>The guidebook should provide, but not be limited to the
following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Approved list of technical and education resources about
        household hazardous products and waste</li>
    <li>Liability issues for consideration before implementation</li>
    <li>Priority listing of HHW based on toxicity and economics
        of collection</li>
    <li>Guidelines and recommendations for various HHWPM programs
        - i.e., implementing an education program, and holding a
        materials exchange in conjunction with a collection
        event.</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff should be trained as a resource to work with
organizations as they use the guidebook to establish HHWPM
programs.</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 3 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote pollution
prevention of HHW through education of the public with a variety
of programs.</h4>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop targeted educational materials
through a variety of media, including: TV public service
announcements; radio spots; newspaper ads; distribution of
materials through the local Clean &amp; Beautiful chapters,
Cooperative Extension Service, and other applicable networks;
fact sheets; press releases; and/or flyers. All materials should
emphasize source reduction as the preferred management option for
HHW. Educational materials designed for teachers to incorporate
into their existing curricula should also be developed.</p>
<p>Consumer-oriented materials should educate buyers on the
environmental effects of HHP and the importance of purchasing
only the quantity needed. If disposal is required then emphasis
is placed on the most environmentally appropriate method. The
Division should be involved in educating the manufacturer,
consumer, and retailer about life-cycle analysis of products.
Additionally, the Division should do more study and have more
dialog with target audiences regarding life-cycle analysis and
other issues regarding HHW that are heavily affected by
manufacturers' attitudes and business pressures, such as
labeling, packaging, etc.</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 4 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should (as funds are
available) fund several pilot HHW collection programs in the
state.</h4>
<p>The work group agreed that collection is an important part of
HHW management, but it is desirable to gather some limited data
on collection in Georgia prior to making any decisions regarding
funding for a full-scale collection program. Division-approved
pilot programs should be located in several different areas of
the state, with an emphasis on events that can provide
information to the state regarding the feasibility of varying
types of collection events (urban vs. rural areas, types of
materials collected, etc.).</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 5 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should create and/or
promote collection for certain HHW items.</h4>
<p>Item #1</p>
<p>Citizens should be encouraged to follow the waste management
hierarchy: Purchase only what is needed, and use up all of the
product to avoid the need for recycling or disposal. Collection
and disposal of HHW items should be limited to those items that
cannot be donated, recycled, recovered, or safely disposed of in
a municipal landfill or down the drain. These items include
banned pesticides, oil-based paints and paints containing heavy
metals, wood preservatives, dioxins, and pool chemicals.</p>
<p>Item #2</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote and support private sector
efforts by retailers, manufacturers, and other stakeholders for
proper recycling or energy recovery of certain items, such as
motor oil, antifreeze, brake fluid, oil filters, latex paint,
solvents, paint thinners, strippers, non-alkaline household
batteries, fluorescent light bulbs, and thermometers. As these
private sector efforts will be impacted by EPA's Universal Waste
Rule, the Division should be involved in the planning process for
state authorization of that Rule.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>MISSION STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Recognition Criteria Work Group </strong></p>
<p>The Pollution Prevention Assistance Division (P<sup>2</sup>AD)
of the Department of Natural Resources was created to develop
programs and activities which encourage Georgia industries to
implement sound pollution prevention programs. P<sup>2</sup>AD's
legislation establishes that participation by industry in the
Division's programs and activities is to be voluntary, and that
proprietary information and reports developed for industry will
remain confidential.</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD has learned that industry considers many
pollution control and other regulations to be a disincentive to
voluntary pollution prevention, and that awards and recognition
are incentives.</p>
<p>The mission of the Recognition Criteria Work Group (RCWG) is
to develop and recommend to the Director of P<sup>2</sup>AD
pollution prevention recognition criteria. Specifically, the work
group is to: 1) develop criteria by which a company would be
judged to have achieved a level of excellence in the development
and implementation of pollution prevention programs which would
qualify the company for a &quot;Certificate of Excellence&quot;;
2) develop criteria by which a company would be judged to have
achieved a greater level of excellence which would qualify the
company for a &quot;Governor's Award&quot;; and 3) develop both
performance criteria for rating a pollution prevention program
and a process through which the Director can request that EPA
and/or EPD reduce regulatory monitoring and reporting
requirements of a company which can verify, by independent
review, achievement of the required level of performance in
pollution prevention. </p>
<p>The above criteria can be qualitative and/or quantitative, the
same or different for each mission objective.</p>
<p>The work group is requested to review current literature on
OSHA and EPA recognition programs, work of the National Academy
of Standards, and other states' programs. The work group is
further requested to solicit and consider public input. The first
task to be completed by the work group is a work plan and
schedule.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee Thomas of Georgia Pacific, Inc. is to serve as chair
of the RCWG. Peter Bonacum, Roy Bowen, Steve O'Day, Elizabeth
Brock, Win Hill, Bob Woodall, Laurie Fowler, David Word, Rep.
Denny Dobbs, Carol Foley, Pete Howard, Bruce Miller, and Wesley
Wolff are to serve as members.</p>
<p>The work group is created by the Director of P<sup>2</sup>AD,
and is advisory to the Director. The work group is to dissolve
upon completion of its mission.</p>
<p>Bill Wells, P<sup>2</sup>AD's Public Information Director,
will serve as principal staff support to the work group and as
liaison for the Director. </p>

state-sponsored pollution prevention recognition program. The
work group acts in an advisory capacity to the Director.</p>
<p>The work group's mission was to recommend criteria by which a
company would be judged to have achieved a level of excellence in
the development and implementation of pollution prevention
programs. The work group was to recommend criteria by which a
company could qualify for a &quot;Governor's Award.&quot; The
work group was also to recommend a process by which the Director
can request that EPD reduce regulatory monitoring and reporting
requirements of those companies which have achieved a required
level of performance in pollution prevention and maintained
compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations.</p>
<p>To accomplish its mission, the work group held three meetings.
The members reviewed pollution prevention recognition programs in
other states, recognition programs of federal agencies, existing
pollution prevention/environmental reporting requirements in
Georgia, and components of a successful pollution prevention
program.</p>
<p>The work group was made up of 14 citizens representing a cross
section of industry, government and environmental groups. The
work group members are Lee Thomas, Chairman; Peter Bonacum, Roy
Bowen, Elizabeth Brock, Rep. Denny Dobbs, Laurie Fowler, Carol
Foley, Win Hill, Pete Howard, Bruce Miller, Steve O'Day, Wesley
Wolff, Bob Woodall and David Word.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
<p>The Recognition Criteria Work Group recommends that the
Pollution Prevention Assistance Division establish a program for
recognizing and rewarding exemplary efforts in the area of
pollution prevention. The underlying objective of the program
should be to encourage pollution prevention in Georgia industries
by recognizing companies that successfully practice pollution
prevention. The recognition program should foster a common agenda
of preventing pollution and waste, increasing efficiency and
improving the environment.</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should work with the Georgia Legislature and
environmental regulators to create meaningful incentives for
companies which practice pollution prevention. However,
incentives would not lessen or interfere with environmental laws
or rules.</p>
<p>The recognition program should not be overburdensome. Whenever
possible, P<sup>2</sup>AD should use existing required
environmental reports as a basis for determining those eligible
for recognition. A company's environmental compliance history
should be considered during the recognition evaluation process.
The program should be at the facility level.</p>
<p>These recommendations should be used as a guide as P<sup>2</sup>AD
develops the requirements of the recognition program. P<sup>2</sup>AD
should continue to involve the public in the development of the
program. In order for the recognition program to become
successful and achieve its objective of encouraging pollution
prevention, it must be embraced by industry, government and the
general public.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>CATEGORIES OF AWARDS</strong></p>
<p>The Recognition Criteria Work Group recommends the formation
of two categories of recognition: a certification program and the
Governor's Award. The certification program should recognize and
reward continuous performance and improvement. It should have
three levels of recognition based on performance and
accomplishment and be measured against criteria developed by P<sup>2</sup>AD.
The three levels in order of increased achievement are: entry,
achievement, and model. Each level would have its own specific
criteria defined by P<sup>2</sup>AD.</p>
<p>At every stage of certification, P<sup>2</sup>AD should, in
consultation with EPD, develop criteria which would establish
that the applicant company is in environmental compliance. A
company must participate in the certification program to be
eligible to participate in the Governor's Award program. The
Governor's Award program recognizes outstanding pollution
prevention projects by a company, individual, organization,
academia, or a government agency. Unlike the certification
program, the Governor's Award should be competitive.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>CERTIFICATION PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p>The certification program is comprised of three levels. Each
level is based on a company's level of commitment to, and
achievement in the area of pollution prevention. The first level
is the Entry Level. In order to be recognized as an Entry Level
participant, a company must meet certain criteria that
demonstrate their interest in, and commitment to, developing a
pollution prevention program. These criteria include the
following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An employee awareness program </li>
    <li>A clear understanding of pollution prevention </li>
    <li>Management and employee commitment </li>
    <li>Established pollution prevention goals </li>
</ul>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop a mechanism which would allow
it to determine if an applicant meets the above criteria and is
in compliance with all federal, state and local environmental
laws and regulations. Certification in the Entry Level program
would be renewable annually based on sustained performance.</p>
<p>The Achievement Level is the second level in the certification
program. The Achievement Level is designed to recognize companies
that have implemented a pollution prevention program. Companies
which obtain the Achievement Level incorporate pollution
prevention into their business activities and can demonstrate
commitment on the part of management to encourage pollution
prevention practices outside the company. A company must have
participated in the Entry Level for at least one year to be
eligible to apply for the Achievement Level. The criteria for the
Achievement Level includes the following in addition to the
criteria for the Entry Level:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Documented reductions of emissions and waste through
        pollution prevention. </li>
    <li>Accounting for all costs and benefits of the company's
        pollution prevention program. </li>
    <li>Reduced and/or more efficient use of resources. </li>
    <li>A community involvement/outreach program. </li>
</ul>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop a mechanism which will allow it
to determine if an applicant meets the above criteria and is in
compliance with all federal, state and local environmental laws
and regulations. Certification in the Achievement Level program
would be renewable annually based on sustained performance.</p>
<p>The Model Level, the third level of the certification program,
is the highest level of achievement. Companies in this category
are considered best-in-class facilities that have exemplary
pollution prevention programs and are recognized as industry
leaders and environmental stewards within their community. To
these companies pollution prevention is not just a commitment but
a practice which is incorporated into all business decisions.
Model Level participants not only instill the pollution
prevention ethic in their employees and vendors, but encourage
others in the community or their industry to incorporate
pollution prevention practices into their daily activities. After
two years at the Achievement Level, a company is eligible to
apply for the Model Level. In addition to meeting the criteria of
the Entry Level and Achievement Level, Model Level candidates
must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Foster a pollution prevention ethic that extends outside
        the boundaries of the company or facility. </li>
    <li>Employ practices that prevent the transfer of pollution
        to other facilities. </li>
    <li>Serve as a witness for pollution prevention practices to
        peers and the public. </li>
    <li>Assist other companies through pollution prevention
        technology transfer. </li>
    <li>Demonstrate a commitment to pollution prevention in
        product development and purchasing decisions. </li>
</ul>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop a mechanism which will allow it
to determine if an applicant meets the above criteria and is in
compliance with all federal, state and local environmental laws
and regulations. Certification in the Model program would be
renewable annually based on sustained performance.</p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Application Process</u></strong></p>
<p>Applications for the certification program should be accepted
year round. After receiving the application, the staff should
determine if the company meets the established criteria. Upon
approval, the company's compliance history should be reviewed.
Companies which have favorable compliance histories will receive
a letter announcing their acceptance in the certification
program. </p>
<p>Any company not wishing to continue to participate in the
program may withdraw. </p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Qualifications</u></strong></p>
<p>The certification program is open to any company that is
located in Georgia. A company or organization interested in
participating should submit an application. A company or
organization could be nominated by another party. Pollution
prevention projects and programs should address all media types
(i.e., air, solid waste, water). </p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Forms of Recognition</u></strong></p>
<p>Companies that achieve certification should be publicly
recognized. P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop a method for informing
the public of the certified company's achievement. Companies that
reach the Achievement Level or Model Level should be eligible for
some type of regulatory and/or financial incentives in the form
of reduced fees, expedited permitting or reduced reporting or
inspections. P<sup>2</sup>AD should consult with EPD to develop
regulatory incentives. If necessary, P<sup>2</sup>AD and EPD
should propose legislation to provide for regulatory incentives.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>GOVERNOR'S AWARD PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p>The Governor's Award for pollution prevention should recognize
special and significant pollution prevention achievements of
companies and organizations in Georgia.</p>
<p>The Governor's Award unlike the certification recognition
program should be an annual competitive award given to a company,
individual, or organization that has demonstrated excellence in
pollution prevention. A company should have participated in the
certification program at some level to be eligible for the annual
Governor's Award. This criteria would not apply to individuals,
academia, non-profit organizations or government. The award
should be presented in three categories. These categories should
be small and medium business, large business, and community
(private/individual/organization/government). There should be no
limits on the number of honorable mention certificates presented.</p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Application Process</u></strong></p>
<p>The application process for the Governor's Award should be
similar to that of the certification recognition program. The
first step should be a screening of all applicants to eliminate
those which are not eligible. P<sup>2</sup>AD should also review
the applicant's compliance history where applicable. Qualified
applications should be judged by a panel of judges including
industry peers and representatives from relevant state agencies
and universities. </p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Qualifications</u></strong></p>
<p>All eligible projects should have occurred during the calendar
year; or in the case of ongoing programs, new activities should
have occurred during the calendar year. Prior recipients are
eligible to compete for the Governor's Award the following year,
although the project must differ from the previous entry. Only
those companies who participate in the certification program
should be eligible for the Governor's Award. This would not apply
to individuals, academia, non-profit organizations or government.</p>
<p>Reductions that are the result of a process being eliminated
or transferred to another facility out of state should not
qualify as pollution prevention activities.</p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Forms of Recognition</u></strong></p>
<p>The principal award in the Governor's Award program should be
public recognition. The award should be presented to the company
by the Governor at an annual event.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b>Pollution Prevention Partners</b></h2>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Entry Level Certification</strong></h2>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Application and Selection Process </strong></h3>
<p>To apply for the Entry Level, facilities must complete the
P&#179; Entry Level application and return it to P&#178;AD.
P&#178;AD is available, at no charge, to assist facilities in
qualifying. The forms will be reviewed at local offices of the
Georgia Tech Economic Development Institute (EDI). An EDI
representative may visit the facility to verify information. The
facility must have no outstanding environmental compliance issues
or violations with the Georgia Environmental Protection Division
(EPD). P&#178;AD will certify the facility's acceptance into the
P&#179; program at the Entry Level and provide notification.
Facilities that fail to qualify for the program will be notified
of the reason, and offered assistance in qualifying.
Certification is granted when the facility meets all Entry Level
criteria and upon approval of the application by P&#178;AD.
Certification is for one year from the date it is granted. To
assure that certification does not lapse, facilities wishing to
be recertified the following year must submit an application no
less than 30 days prior to the expiration date of the
certificate. Facilities wishing to move to a higher level may
apply at any time. </p>
<hr>
<h3><b>Qualifications</b> </h3>
<p>To qualify as an Achievement Level Pollution Prevention
Partner a facility must meet the following general requirements: </p>
<p>1. The facility must be located in Georgia. </p>
<p>2. The facility must have no outstanding compliance issues or
violations with the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. </p>
<p>3. Facilities must have pollution prevention plans with
numeric goals for reductions through pollution prevention and a
time line for achieving those goals. P&#178;AD must approve the
facility&#146;s reduction goals. <b>(P&#178;AD is available to
assist companies in developing pollution prevention plans)</b> </p>
<p>4. Only those programs and activities that meet the definition
of pollution prevention will be considered.</p>
<p>(Pollution prevention is defined by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) as &#147;the use of materials, processes,
and practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants
or wastes at the source.&#148; Examples of pollution prevention
activities include inventory management/purchasing procedures,
source reduction, process modifications, housekeeping/good
operating practices, material substitutions, redesign of product,
pollution prevention education/outreach, and in-process
recycling. Disposal, off site recycling or reprocessing of wastes
is not pollution prevention.)</p>
<p>5. Certified facilities must agree to allow P<sup>2</sup>AD
the opportunity to publish non-proprietary information about
their pollution prevention program. </p>
<p>To be recognized as an Entry Level Pollution Prevention
Partner, facilities must meet certain criteria that demonstrate
their interest in and commitment to establishing a formal,
facility-wide pollution prevention program. The requirements are:</p>
<p><b><u>Pollution prevention plan</u></b></p>
<p>The facility must establish a pollution prevention plan that
contains goals for reducing waste and emissions through pollution
prevention. The reduction goals will be used as criteria for
advancement in the program. P<sup>2</sup>AD must approve the
facility's reduction goals. (P<sup>2</sup>AD has model plans and
a sample Entry Level application available. P<sup>2</sup>AD is
available to assist companies in developing pollution prevention
plans.) </p>
<p><b><u>Management commitment</u></b><u> </u></p>
<p>Applicants must demonstrate management commitment to the
pollution prevention program by having the highest ranking
company officer at the facility sign the pollution prevention
plan. </p>
<p><b><u>Employee commitment</u></b><u> </u></p>
<p>Applicants must demonstrate employee commitment by creating
one or more pollution prevention teams of employees to develop
strategies for the program.</p>
<p><b><u>Employee awareness program</u></b></p>
<p>Applicants must notify employees of the facility's pollution
prevention program and motivate employees to participate. </p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Rules/Guidelines </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>Facilities must reapply yearly and show progress
            toward goals. </li>
        <li>Facilities that fail to qualify may resubmit an
            application at any time. </li>
        <li>Applications for the P&#179; program are accepted
            year round. </li>
        <li>Facilities wishing to withdraw from the program may
            do so by letter or by not reapplying the following
            year. All rewards and recognition associated with the
            company's participation in the program will be
            terminated at such time. </li>
        <li>A facility may participate at the Entry Level for no
            more than three consecutive years.</li>

<h3><strong>Section 2.0 - Pollution Prevention Plan</strong></h3>
<p>You may attach an existing plan, or use the following form
(Sections 2-4) as your plan. Existing plans must include all of
the elements requested below.</p>
<p><strong>2.1 Provide the facility's written pollution
prevention policy statement that indicates management's and
employees' commitment to preventing pollution and waste at the
source.</strong></p>
<p>This is the facility's statement indicating a commitment by
management and employees to preventing pollution at the source.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Provide a brief description of the facility's
operations. </strong>(If available, provide a process flow
diagram)</p>
<p>Describe what product(s) is made at the facility and what
processes are used to make the product(s).</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Waste stream identification, facility production
and reduction goals.</strong></p>
<p>The following chart is designed to help establish a baseline
year for measuring reductions. Identify the waste streams that
your facility generates and establish production for the baseline
year. Not all facilities generate waste in each category.
Establish reduction goals, by percentage, for the following year
and for the long-term. The projected year for achieving the
long-term goals must be included.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 Facility waste stream and reduction goals chart.</strong></p>
<p>At top of the table, enter a baseline year (1995 or earlier).
For each type of waste (hazardous, wastewater, air emissions, and
solid waste), enter the following information:</p>
<p><em>Column 1</em> - No entry necessary.</p>
<p><em>Column 2</em> - Enter the source(s) of each type of waste
generated. If no waste of the type listed in column 1 is
generated, enter None and go to next row. Example sources include
painting and cleaning operations, materials past expiration date
for hazardous wastes, potable water or process water for
wastewater sources, boiler or paint booth for air emissions, and
pallets, scrap steel, office paper for solid waste sources. </p>
<p><em>Column 3</em> - Enter the total amount of waste generated
in the baseline year for each category of waste. Use units of
pounds for hazardous waste and air emissions, gallons for
wastewater, and tons for total solid waste.</p>
<p><em>Column 4 </em>- Enter baseline year production in specific
units. Product quantities or dollar values are preferred. Example
units include automobiles, linear feet of pipe, number of
employees, annual sales, gallons of cleaning chemicals. Beyond
the entry level, production numbers will be used to normalize
waste reduction percentages based on production levels.</p>
<p><em>Column 5</em> - For each category of waste, enter your
reduction goal for calendar year 1996 versus your waste
generation in the baseline year. </p>
<p>1996 Reduction goal = (1996 waste generation/Baseline year
waste generation)x 100 (%) </p>
<p><em>Column 6</em> - For each category of waste, enter your
long term reduction goal versus your waste generation in the
baseline year. Also enter the year that you propose achieving
this goal by.</p>
<p>LT Reduction goal = (LT waste generation/Baseline year waste
generation)x 100 (%) </p>
<p>Your long term reduction goal will be used as a metric in
applying for Achievement Level and Model Level Certification in
the Pollution Prevention Partners program. </p>
<p>For each type of waste, enter a short description of potential
methods for minimizing wastes through pollution prevention.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b>Pollution Prevention Partners</b></h2>
<h2 align="center"><b>Achievement Level Certification</b> </h2>
<hr>
<h3><b>Application and Selection Process</b> </h3>
<p>To apply for the Achievement Level, facilities must complete
the P&#179; Achievement Level application and return it to
P&#178;AD. <b>P&#178;AD is available, at no charge, to assist
facilities in qualifying.</b> The forms will be reviewed at local
offices of the Georgia Tech Economic Development Institute (EDI).
An EDI representative may visit the facility to verify
information. </p>
<p>To be eligible for a reduction in fees, the facility must have
no outstanding environmental compliance issues or violations, and
be approved by EPD. After being notified that a facility has
applied for acceptance in the P&#179; program, each EPD Branch
will check the applicant&#146;s files. If the applicant has no
files or no violations documented during the previous 12 months,
the applicant will be certified as eligible for the P&#179;
program. If the applicant had a violation, the Branch will
determine if it was resolved expeditiously. If so, the
application will be certified. If the violation is unresolved or
if the applicant was resistant in resolving, the application will
not be certified. </p>
<p>P&#178;AD will certify the facility&#146;s acceptance into the
P&#179; program at the Achievement Level and provide
notification. Facilities that fail to qualify for Achievement
Level status will be notified of the reason, and offered
assistance in qualifying. </p>
<p>Certification is granted when the facility meets all
Achievement Level criteria, EPD file review and upon approval of
the application by P&#178;AD. Certification is for one year from
the date it is granted. To assure that certification does not
lapse, facilities wishing to be recertified the following year
must submit an application no less than 30 days prior to the
expiration date of the certificate. Facilities wishing to move to
a higher level may apply at any time. </p>
<hr>
<h3><b>Qualifications</b> </h3>
<p>To qualify as an Achievement Level Pollution Prevention
Partner a facility must meet the following general requirements: </p>
<p>1. The facility must be located in Georgia. </p>
<p>2. The facility must have no outstanding compliance issues or
violations with the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. </p>
<p>3. Facilities must have pollution prevention plans with
numeric goals for reductions through pollution prevention and a
time line for achieving those goals. P&#178;AD must approve the
facility&#146;s reduction goals. <b>(P&#178;AD is available to
assist companies in developing pollution prevention plans)</b> </p>
<p>4. Only those programs and activities that meet the definition
of pollution prevention will be considered. </p>
<p>(Pollution prevention is defined by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) as &#147;the use of materials, processes,
and practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants
or wastes at the source.&#148; Examples of pollution prevention
activities include inventory management/purchasing procedures,
source reduction, process modifications, housekeeping/good
operating practices, material substitutions, redesign of product,
pollution prevention education/outreach, and in-process
recycling. Disposal, off site recycling or reprocessing of wastes
is not pollution prevention.)</p>
<p>5. Certified facilities must agree to allow P<sup>2</sup>AD
the opportunity to publish non-proprietary information about
their pollution prevention program. </p>
<p>To be recognized as an Achievement Level Pollution Prevention
Partner, a facility must meet criteria that demonstrate a
pollution prevention program is in place and achieving
reductions. The requirements are: </p>
<p><b><u>Pollution prevention reductions</u></b><u> </u></p>
<p>The facility must have in place a pollution prevention plan
with stated reduction goals (goals must be approved by
P&#178;AD). The facility must achieve 25 percent of reduction
goals from the baseline year stated in its pollution prevention
plan. Facilities must demonstrate reductions in all categories of
waste generated at the facility. (E.g., Facilities with four
categories of waste must show reductions in each category - solid
waste, hazardous waste, air emissions and wastewater/water usage.
Facilities with three categories of waste must show reductions in
each category.) Reductions achieved only through pollution
prevention, as defined above, will qualify. Facilities must
report cost savings, if any, related to reductions. </p>
<p><b><u>Management commitment</u></b><u> </u></p>
<p>The facility&#146;s pollution prevention plan must be fully
developed and available in written form. The pollution prevention
plan must be incorporated in whole, in part or by reference into
the facility&#146;s business plan or plan of operation. </p>
<p><b><u>Outreach</u></b><u> </u></p>
<p>Applicants must inform citizens in the surrounding community
of the facility&#146;s pollution prevention program and encourage
pollution prevention in the community. <b>(P&#178;AD has model
Outreach plans available)</b> </p>
<hr>
<h3><b>Rules/Guidelines</b> </h3>
<p>1. Facilities must reapply yearly and show progress toward
reduction goals. </p>
<p>2. Facilities that fail to qualify may resubmit an
application. </p>
<p>3. Applications for the P&#179; program are accepted year
round. </p>
<p>4. Facilities wishing to withdraw from the program may do so
by letter or by not reapplying the following year. All rewards
and recognition associated with the company&#146;s participation
in the program will be terminated at such time. </p>
<p>5. Facilities may apply for Achievement Level status if they
have been an Entry Level Pollution Prevention Partner for at
least one year. Facilities may also apply for the Achievement
Level if they have met Entry Level criteria for at least one
year. </p>
<p>6. Facilities must meet Entry Level criteria in addition to
Achievement Level criteria. </p>
<p>7. Applications must be certified by a Professional Engineer. </p>
<p>8. Facilities receiving a reduction in fees must sign a
statement acknowledging that those funds have been, or will be,
applied to the facility&#146;s pollution prevention activities. </p>
<p>9. To qualify for a reduction in fees, Large Quantity
Generators of hazardous waste must demonstrate a reduction in
hazardous waste generation. </p>
<p>10. To qualify for a reduction in fees, facilities with
reported releases defined in Section 313 of SARA Title III must
demonstrate a reduction in reported releases. </p>
<p>11. Facilities applying for a reduction in fees for the second
year must achieve 30 percent of overall reduction goals. </p>
<p>12. Facilities applying for a reduction in fees for the third
year must achieve 35 percent of overall reduction goals. </p>
<p>13. A facility may participate at the Achievement Level for no
more than five consecutive years. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b>Pollution Prevention Partners</b></h2>
<h2 align="center"><b>Model Level Certification</b> </h2>
<hr>
<h3><b>Application and Selection Process</b> </h3>
<p>To apply for the Model Level, facilities must complete the
P&#179; Model Level application and return it to P&#178;AD.<b>
P&#178;AD is available, at no charge, to assist facilities in
qualifying.</b> The forms will be reviewed at local offices of
the Georgia Tech Economic Development Institute (EDI). An EDI
representative may visit the facility to verify information. </p>
<p>To be eligible for a reduction in fees, the facility must have
no outstanding environmental compliance issues or violations, and
be approved by EPD. After being notified that a facility has
applied for acceptance in the P&#179; program, each EPD Branch
will check the applicant&#146;s files. If the applicant has no
files or no violations documented during the previous 12 months,
the applicant will be certified as eligible for the P&#179;
program. If the applicant had a violation, the Branch will
determine if it was resolved expeditiously. If so, the
application will be certified. If the violation is unresolved or
if the applicant was resistant in resolving, the application will
not be certified. </p>
<p>P&#178;AD will certify the facility&#146;s acceptance into the
P&#179; program at the Model Level and provide notification.
Facilities that fail to qualify for Model Level status will be
notified of the reason, and offered assistance in qualifying. </p>
<p>Certification is granted when the facility meets all Model
Level criteria, EPD file review and upon approval of the
application by P&#178;AD. Certification is for one year from the
date it is granted. To assure that certification does not lapse,
facilities wishing to be recertified the following year must
submit an application no less than 30 days prior to the
expiration date of the certificate. Facilities wishing to move to
a higher level may apply at any time. </p>
<hr>
<h3><b>Qualifications</b> </h3>
<p>To qualify as a Model Level Pollution Prevention Partner a
facility must meet the following general requirements: </p>
<p>1. The facility must be located in Georgia. </p>
<p>2. The facility must have no outstanding compliance issues or
violations with the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. </p>
<p>3. Facilities must have pollution prevention plans with
numeric goals for reductions through pollution prevention and a
time line for achieving those goals. P&#178;AD must approve the
facility&#146;s reduction goals. <b>(P&#178;AD is available to
assist companies in developing pollution prevention plans)</b> </p>
<p>4. Only those programs and activities that meet the definition
of pollution prevention will be considered. </p>
<p>(Pollution prevention is defined by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) as &#147;the use of materials, processes,
and practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants
or wastes at the source.&#148; Examples of pollution prevention
activities include inventory management/purchasing procedures,
source reduction, process modifications, housekeeping/good
operating practices, material substitutions, redesign of product,
pollution prevention education/outreach, and in-process
recycling. Disposal, off site recycling or reprocessing of wastes
is not pollution prevention.)</p>
<p>5. Certified facilities must agree to allow P<sup>2</sup>AD
the opportunity to publish non-proprietary information about
their pollution prevention program. </p>
<p>To be recognized as a Model Level Pollution Prevention
Partner, facilities must meet Entry Level and Achievement Level
requirements and the following additional criteria: </p>
<p><b><u>Pollution prevention reductions</u></b><u> </u></p>
<p>The facility must have in place a pollution prevention plan
with stated reduction goals (goals must be approved by
P&#178;AD). The facility must achieve 50 percent of overall
reduction goals from the baseline year as stated in its pollution
prevention plan. Facilities must demonstrate reductions in all
categories of waste generated at the facility and improved
efficiencies in the use of utilities and water. (E.g., Facilities
with four categories of waste must show reductions in each
category - solid waste, hazardous waste, air emissions and waste
water. Facilities with three categories of waste must show
reductions in each category.) Reductions achieved only through
pollution prevention, as defined above, will qualify. Facilities
must also report cost savings, if any, related to reductions. </p>
<p><b><u>External pollution prevention practices</u></b><u> </u></p>
<p>The facility must show how it is promoting pollution
prevention to its clients and vendors. The facility must show
that its efforts to prevent pollution do not cause the transfer
of pollution to other facilities. The facility must show that it
is promoting pollution prevention in its industry. </p>
<p><b><u>Purchasing and Product Development</u></b> </p>
<p>The facility must show that it has incorporated pollution
prevention in its purchasing practices, and, if applicable, in
the development of new products. </p>
<hr>
<h3><b>Rules/Guidelines</b> </h3>
<p>1. Facilities must reapply yearly and show progress toward
reduction goals. </p>
<p>2. Facilities that fail to qualify may resubmit an
application. </p>
<p>3. Applications for the P&#179; program are accepted year
round. </p>
<p>4. Facilities wishing to withdraw from the program may do so
by letter or by not reapplying the following year. All rewards
and recognition associated with the company&#146;s participation
in the program will be terminated at such time. </p>
<p>5. Facilities may apply for Model Level status if they have
been an Achievement Level Pollution Prevention Partner for at
least two years. Facilities may also apply for this level if they
have met Achievement Level criteria for at least two years. </p>
<p>6. Facilities must meet Entry Level and Achievement Level
criteria in addition to Model Level criteria. </p>
<p>7. Applications must be certified by a Professional Engineer. </p>
<p>8. Facilities receiving a reduction in fees must sign a
statement acknowledging that those funds have been, or will be,
applied to pollution prevention activities. </p>
<p>9. To qualify for a reduction in fees, Large Quantity
Generators of hazardous waste must demonstrate a reduction in
hazardous waste generation. </p>
<p>10. To qualify for a reduction in fees, facilities with
reported releases defined in Section 313 of SARA Title III must
demonstrate a reduction in reported releases. </p>
<p>11. Facilities applying for a reduction in fees for the second
year must achieve 60 percent of overall reduction goals. </p>
<p>12. Facilities applying for a reduction in fees for the third
year must achieve 70 percent of overall reduction goals. </p>
<p>13. Facilities may participate at the Model Level status
indefinitely. </p>
<p>14. Applicants must inform citizens in the surrounding
community that the facility has applied to be a Pollution

<hr>
<p>As P<sup>2</sup>AD continues to expand and refine the
technical assistance programs of the Division, our discussions
with those of you in industry have been quite helpful as we plan
future programs. Thanks to all of you who have called, stopped by
our booth at a recent exposition, or (better yet) used our
services! These many conversations, coupled with the data we
obtained from the industry survey conducted for us by Georgia
State University last summer, have shown us that businesses want
technical information and training focused on specific topics of
interest to them, as opposed to general pollution prevention
topics. Additionally, our recent industrial sector prioritization
and analysis efforts (as profiled in the last newsletter) have
identified solvent usage as a key issue for a variety of
businesses in the state. In response to this issue, as well as
the need for very focused training information, and the impending
deadlines imposed by the Montreal Protocol, the Division will be
sponsoring a solvent alternatives conference in Atlanta on June
29th. The conference is being planned in cooperation with the
Georgia Tech Research Institute; more specific information and a
registration form can be found elsewhere in this newsletter.</p>
<p>The June 29th conference also builds on some earlier workshops
conducted by the Division, specifically the January 1994 Solvent
Substitution Conference and the October 1994 Airline/Aircraft
Conference. I encourage those of you who attended these past
conferences to make plans to attend on June 29th; new information
will be presented, additional vendors will be represented, and
there will be ample opportunity to network with your peers. For
those of you who haven't attended our conferences or workshops in
the past, please consider attending this one and learning more
about P<sup>2</sup>AD and solvent alternatives.</p>
<p>This issue of From the Source is also an attempt to provide
our readers with technical information focused on one specific
subject area--in this case, solvent usage and alternatives.
Please let us know what you think about having the newsletter
focus on aspects of a particular issue. You may address any
comments to Jancie Hatcher at (404) 651-5120 or 1-800-685-2443.</p>

<h4>Industry Helping Industry</h4>
<p>What do a printer and a military base have in common? Plenty -
Both are located in Georgia; both use solvents; both have a
strong commitment to preventing pollution; and both use rags.</p>
<p>When I envisioned the direction of this Division, industry
helping industry was certainly one desirable goal. Not only have
companies in this state shared their case studies at workshops,
but also in direct consultation efforts, for example, Williams
Printing Co. opened its door to share their ideas and success
story on a one-to-one basis.</p>
<p>Robins Air Force Base (AFB), in their continual commitment to
pollution prevention, decided to investigate rag disposal
alternatives using the resources and expertise of P<sup>2</sup>AD.
Thanks to the willingness of Williams, Robins AFB was able to see
first-hand how to use a centrifuge to recover solvent from rags
as an alternative to their current rag disposal method. Williams
clearly demonstrated the benefits of using a centrifuge to
recover solvents, even though Robins AFB generates several
thousand more pounds of rags contaminated with solvent than
Williams. During the visit, engineers at Williams discussed both
the problems and costs associated with implementing the new
system, as well as the environmental and financial benefits of
recovering the solvents and reusing the rags. The staff at Robins
took the opportunity to ask questions about the design of the
system, so that they could determine the feasibility of
implementing a similar process. </p>
<p>This is an example of what I hope will grow into a network of
industries in this state that are willing to share information,
thereby enhancing the profitability, productivity, and pollution
prevention activities of all involved. P<sup>2</sup>AD is
available to facilitate other similar exchanges in the future.</p>
<h4>A Note of Thanks</h4>
<p>As you read on the front page, the Recognition Criteria Work
Group has created a draft report of their recommendation to
develop a Recognition Program. Once the staff has formalized the
program, it will be one of the best in the country, going well
beyond the typical recognition program to one that rewards the
high achievements of companies that participate. I am excited
about the possibilities that this type of program could create in
our state; acting as a catalyst to encourage pollution prevention
practices among Georgia businesses.</p>
<p>And finally I would like to express my appreciation to the

<h3><b>SERA Partnership Formed</b></h3>
<p>From the very beginning of P<sup>2</sup>AD's operation, the
Division has leveraged outside resources whenever possible to
accomplish its mission. This approach has used innovative
public-private partnerships with the university system, trade
associations, and federal and state agencies to maximize the
effectiveness of our pollution prevention efforts in Georgia. In
fact, maximizing the use of existing resources is one of the
Division's core strategies, and P<sup>2</sup>AD's goal is to
continue to acquire appropriate partners in both the public and
private sectors. In furtherance of this goal, I am pleased to
announce our partnership on behalf of the State of Georgia with
the Southeastern Environmental Resources Alliance (SERA). SERA is
a non-profit organization set up to provide environmental
information, technical assistance, and other related services to
small and medium-sized businesses in Georgia and South Carolina.
SERA will also be involved in technology transfer of waste
management technologies from the Savannah River Site. We are
excited about this partnership for a number of reasons, but
particularly because it will enhance our ability to provide
technical assistance to industries and businesses in the state.
We will be including more details in the newsletter as the
specifics of this partnership develop. For now, see the <a
href="Sera.htm">article</a> on the front page for some initial
information about SERA.</p>
<h3><b>Trucking Best Management Practices Workshop Held</b></h3>
<p>In October P<sup>2</sup>AD, in cooperation with the Georgia
Motor Trucking Association (GMTA) and the American Trucking
Association (ATA), sponsored a very successful one-day workshop
at Clayton State College. The workshop reviewed stormwater best
management practices and pollution prevention techniques
applicable to trucking and fleet maintenance operations. P<sup>2</sup>AD
is very appreciative of the excellent work that ATA and GMTA
performed in conducting this workshop. We particularly want to
thank Karen Medlin of ATA for her efforts in coordinating the
day's activities. See the <a href="Truck.htm">article</a> on the
next page for details of the workshop and a special free video
offer.</p>
<h3><b>Automotive Fluids Work Group to be Formed</b></h3>
<p>As many of you are aware, during 1995 P<sup>2</sup>AD
sponsored a work group that made recommendations to me regarding
a state-sponsored household hazardous waste (HHW) program (see <a
href="Hhwnews.htm">article</a> on page 1 of this newsletter). One
of these recommendations is that the Division should encourage
private sector collection of certain household hazardous wastes.
Automotive fluids (such as oil and antifreeze) are one category
of HHW for which private collection and management of the wastes
are widely available. P<sup>2</sup>AD is currently forming an
Automotive Fluids Work Group to take a closer look at this
particular area of concern. The work group will be composed of
representatives from environmental organizations, trade
associations, recyclers of automotive products, and government.
This work group will serve for a limited period of time and will
provide the Division with specific recommendations for prevention
and management of auto-related wastes. If you have input for this
work group to consider, or you would like more information about
the work group, please contact Bill Wells of my staff at (404)
651-5120 or 800-685-2443.</p>

<h2 align="center">How Clean is Clean?</h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by Paul Crumpler, Pollution Prevention
Engineer</strong></p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>Frying pans, cars, the Empire State Building, surgical
instruments, machined aluminum light poles, and Rottweilers all
have two things in common. All get dirty and somebody wants to
clean them, whether they need it or not. The keys to cleaning are
knowing the nature of the item to be cleaned, the nature of the
soil to be removed, the number of items to be cleaned, and what
will be done with the item after it is cleaned. When these items
are known, an appropriate cleaning method can be chosen.
Sometimes the choice is not to clean, as in the case of the
Rottweiler. Some essential items to remember are that a perfectly
clean part will cost more to produce, cost more to maintain
cleanliness, generate more waste during cleaning, and often
functions no better (and sometimes worse) than a part cleaned to
a less lofty standard. Perfectly clean is also perfectly
impossible to achieve. </p>
<h3>The Importance of Specs</h3>
<p>Specifications are often left to the imagination when
cleanliness is required. &quot;Oxygen clean,&quot; &quot;free of
oil and grease,&quot; and &quot;remove all chips, oil, dirt,
etc.&quot; are typical notes placed on engineering drawings.
Besides being unmeasurable, they are often added by rote as part
of standard drawing notes. Pass / fail criteria are much better
ways of specifying cleanliness. For example, a critical area of
the part in question could be examined under magnification with a
ten by ten millimeter (mm) field broken into 100, one millimeter
squares. A maximum number of machining chips could be specified;
for example, the part will be acceptable if no more than three
machining chips are visible within the grid, with the largest
chip no larger than 0.5 mm in any direction. The presence of oil,
dust, or unidentified foreign material could also be specified in
a similar manner. Other pass/ fail tests could be devised of
varying sophistication; the importance of specifications is to
insure that the part is suitable for use. </p>
<p>Functional specifications can also be applied indirectly.
Cleanliness of painted parts can be specified in terms of paint
adhesion. If a specific level of adhesion is specified for the
part, the level of cleanliness of the part must be such that
paint adhesion will not suffer. A common paint adhesion test is
the scratch test. A painted surface is cut with a razor blade;
adhesive tape is placed over the scratch and then pulled off. The
amount of paint adhering to the tape is used as the pass / fail
criteria of the paint. But it is also a direct functional test of
the cleanliness of the part. Fingerprints, oils, or other
materials that could cause the paint to not adhere to the part
must be removed sufficiently prior to painting in order for the
coating to pass the test. It should be noted that manufacturers
have found that some items require no cleaning prior to painting.
Certain casting techniques, oil-free machining, and proper
selection of paint can allow parts to be used without any type of
cleaning prior to painting. An important aspect of no-clean
methods is prevention; if parts do not get dirty then they do not
need cleaning.</p>
<p>Cleaning is the removal of offending soils from an item
without destroying the item. Offending soils are any substances
that prevent the item from functioning as intended.
Unfortunately, there are many types of offending soils and
offended parts that need to be cleaned. The most common cleaning
application is cleaning prior to painting; this generally
consists of removing oils, greases, waxes, silicon, and mill
scale from metal surfaces to improve paint adhesion and
appearance. Maintenance cleaning jobs are also very common;
maintenance cleaning is typically removal of process materials to
prevent cross contamination of products, allow inspection and
replacement of worn parts, or removal of a buildup of materials
that may interfere with the function of the equipment. Regardless
of the reason for cleaning, common methods are usually some
combination of mechanical, aqueous, or solvent cleaning methods.
When selecting a cleaning method, chose a method that will
generate minimal waste. The amount of waste generated by the
cleaning process is a critical consideration. This is compounded
if either the cleaning media or the materials cleaned contain
hazardous materials. </p>
<h3>Blast Cleaning</h3>
<p>Old paint is often removed from machinery using sand blasting.
If the old paint contains lead, then it is likely that the spent
sand will be considered a hazardous waste. Sand blasting
generates very large volumes of spent sand; disposal costs of
hazardous waste from sand blasting can very high. A blasting
media that often generates less waste is steel shot. Steel shot
can be collected and reused many times for blasting; sand can be
reused very few times due to fracturing of the sand as it strikes
a surface. Even though steel shot and steel shot blasting
equipment is considerably more expensive when compared to sand,
steel shot blasting is much more economical for removal of
potentially hazardous coatings. In addition to sand and shot
blasting, there are many other types of abrasives and blasting
systems available ranging from air knives to carbon dioxide. Each
system is useful for a particular situation.</p>
<h3>Aqueous Cleaning Methods</h3>
<p>Another common cleaning method is aqueous cleaning. Water is
the primary ingredient in aqueous cleaning systems enhanced by
various detergents, acids, bases, heat, agitation, and abrasives.
Aqueous cleaning can be used on almost any type of material from
electronics to precision bearing assemblies. Instead of causing
corrosion, rust inhibitors can be applied to metallic parts while
cleaning in water-based solutions. Metal parts are often
degreased and pretreated prior to painting using spray wash
aqueous systems. Spray wash systems range from small,
self-contained cabinet systems, such as a common dishwasher, for
single part or batch cleaning, to large continuous processing
systems with numerous washing, rinsing, and drying stages.
Aqueous dip tanks are sometimes used to clean parts; dip tanks
are often enhanced using ultrasonic vibrations to improve the
solvency of the water and detergent. Dip tanks are also commonly
used for hand cleaning of parts using any combination of brushes,
rags, and scrapers. Vibratory and tumble cleaners use abrasive
media to remove burrs and radius corners of metal parts while
cleaning. Ceramic, metallic, and plastic abrasives of various
sizes and properties can be added to vibratory and tumble
cleaners. Rock polishers used by hobbyists are examples of tumble
cleaning. Water is not free and water treatment can be extremely
expensive. Detergents, phosphates, oils, and metals are
introduced into wastewater and rinse water from aqueous cleaning
systems. These chemicals are regulated as preset discharge limits
by the EPA and local publicly owned wastewater treatment systems.
Fines and surcharges will be imposed if the discharge limits
cannot be met. When considering an aqueous system, minimize water
use and contamination. Discuss plans with the administrator of
the local POTW (Publicly Owned Treatment Works). Choose cleaning
chemicals carefully. Many companies have installed expensive
aqueous cleaning systems to avoid the use of solvents only to
find that wastewater problems are equally as severe. Semi-aqueous
Cleaning Solvents are sometimes added to water to improve
cleaning or reduce cost in semi-aqueous cleaning. N-methyl
pyrrolidone (NMP) can be added to water or it can be used alone.
NMP is often reduced with water for cleaning jobs that do not
require the full strength solvent; cost can be reduced in this
manner. Depending on the particular solvent used, semi-aqueous
cleaning can be accomplished using the same methods as aqueous
cleaning. Flashpoint, air emissions, worker exposure, waste
treatment, and disposal are considerations when choosing a
semi-aqueous method. </p>
<h3>Solvent Cleaning</h3>
<p>Solvents are used either in pure form or blends of several
solvents to remove coatings or degrease components prior to some
other processing step. Solvents became the preferred choice for
cleaning chemicals in many industries due to their effectiveness
as cleaning agents and fast drying time. Solvents are used in
hand wiping, dip tanks, spray washing, laundry dry cleaning, and
vapor degreasers. As in aqueous cleaning, cleaning can be
enhanced by agitation, ultrasonic vibration, and heat. MEK
(methyl ethyl ketone), toluene, xylene, Freons,
1,1,1-trichloroethane, and perchloroethylene are some
traditionally used cleaning solvents that are very good at
degreasing and have a wide range of solvency. They are also
either toxic or ozone depleting chemicals and heavily regulated.
For these reasons, many companies are seeking other methods of
cleaning such as aqueous or blasting methods. Often, less
hazardous solvents can be substituted; mineral spirits or NMP can
be substituted for MEK in some cleaning applications. Most
solvents are sources of air pollution; their use is often
restricted and regulated even when nontoxic or nonhazardous
solvents are used. Solvents that are very toxic, have a low
flashpoint, or are ozone depleting should be avoided. </p>
<p>Once solvents become too laden with soils to clean, they can
either be disposed of off-site or recovered by filtration or
distillation. Filtration techniques can remove solid and
dissimilar liquid contaminants, leaving the solvent suitable for
some extended reuse. Distillation units can be purchased to
remove almost all contamination; distilled solvents can often be
reused as virgin solvent either for product formulation or
cleaning. After their use has been minimized, distillation and
filtration are good ways to reduce disposal and operating cost. </p>
<h3>Where to Get More Information</h3>
<p>Table 1 lists some common cleaning methods and chemicals,
their uses, and waste generating potential. These methods and
others are described in a software package entitled SAGE or
Solvent Alternatives Guide. SAGE is an interactive computer
program designed to provide alternatives to solvent cleaning
after asking specific questions about the current cleaning
processes and materials. Options are ranked numerically according
to their potential for successfully fulfilling the specific
cleaning needs. Detailed descriptions of the cleaning
technologies will be provided by SAGE in addition to vendor
information. SAGE can be obtained via modem from the
Environmental Protection Agency's Technology Transfer Network
(TTN) bulletin board at (919) 541-5472 or through the Internet. P<sup>2</sup>AD
can also provide a diskette with the program upon request;
contact Jan Bunn at (404) 651-5120 or (800) 685-2443 in Georgia
to request a free diskette. More detailed information can be
obtained by attending the Solvent Alternatives Workshop on June
15, 1995 in Atlanta. The one-day workshop will be held on the
Georgia Tech campus, and will provided detailed descriptions of
many industrial cleaning methods. Workshop attendees will have a
good opportunity to ask the experts about their particular
cleaning needs. P<sup>2</sup>AD also has an e-mail address, send
questions, comments, or information requests to <a

<h2 align="center">NICE<sup>3</sup> Grants</h2>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>As many of you are aware, P<sup>2</sup>AD currently has two
grants from the Department of Energy's (DOE) National Industrial
Competitiveness through Energy, Environment, and Economics (NICE<sup>3</sup>)
program. One of these projects is investigating the automated
reuse of dyebaths in carpet manufacturing. Shaw Industries in
Dalton will be the demonstration site for this grant. Our other
current project is developing an advanced mineral calcining
process, which will improve lime recovery in the pulp and paper
industry. The next phase of this project will be a
commercial-scale demonstration at the Weyerhaeuser Corporation
plant in Oglethorpe.</p>
<p>The Division's past success in the NICE<sup>3</sup> program
can be attributed in part to our thorough and lengthy review of
all proposals submitted for funding. Additionally, our past
experiences have taught us that a period of several months will
be necessary to produce the final proposal documents for
submission to DOE. Therefore, we strongly recommend that anyone
who wishes to apply for the NICE<sup>3</sup> 1996 program submit
an abstract for P<sup>2</sup>AD's consideration on or before
August 2, 1995. This will enable us to have sufficient time to
work with the projects prior to DOE's two-page abstract deadline
of October 2, 1995. Note that this does not preclude applicants
from working with other eligible state agencies in submitting a
proposal past this recommended deadline ; the August 2 date
applies only if you are seeking to submit an application through
P<sup>2</sup>AD. See the description below for more details.</p>
<h3>NICE<sup>3</sup> Grant Solicitation</h3>
<p>The Georgia Pollution Prevention Assistance Division is
pleased to solicit abstracts from parties with innovative
pollution prevention projects who are interested in applying for
the 1996 round of NICE<sup>3</sup> grants from the Department of
Energy. The timeline for the 1996 Solicitation is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>August 2, 1995 - Recommended submission date for project
        abstract to P<sup>2</sup>AD </li>
    <li>October 2, 1995 - Deadline for submission of two-page
        abstract to DOE</li>
    <li>January 16, 1996 - Deadline for application package
        submission to DOE</li>
    <li>April 22, 1996 - Awards announcement </li>
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Reducing Waste from Solvent Sink Parts Washers</h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by Paul Crumpler, Pollution Prevention
Engineer </strong></p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>So you have 14 solvent sink parts washers. They clean well,
but waste management is a problem. The sink company replaces the
solvent every four weeks and now you just found out that you are
a hazardous waste Large Quantity Generator. What can you do?
Fortunately, there are several steps that can be taken to reduce
waste and save money. </p>
<p>How dirty is the solvent in the sink? If the solvent is still
cleaning your parts well, do not change the solvent. There is no
rule that says solvent must be changed out every four weeks. Only
replace the solvent when it no longer cleans. Run some tests and
see how long the solvent will last. Some sinks may be used more
than others. Periodically moving sinks from light to heavy wash
loading areas will extend the solvent life by sharing the
cleaning load between all sinks. </p>
<p>Is there a filter on the solvent sink? Many newer solvent
sinks will filter solids from the solvent as the pump
recirculates the solvent. Instead of replacing the solvent, some
companies have found that only the filter needs to be replaced to
keep the solvent sink working. If the solvent sink is leased, the
supply company can often replace existing sinks with filter type
sinks. If your company owns the sinks, consider purchasing new
sinks with filters or refitting the sinks with filters.</p>
<p>Use the solvent sinks in stages. If solvent sinks are used in
pairs, the solvent will last longer. One sink is the first stage
washer; very dirty parts are washed here. The second sink is the
final washer. The solvent in the first stage will become very
dirty, but even dirty solvent will remove heavy grease and grime.
The final wash sink will stay clean; the clean solvent will
remove any grime left on the part after it has passed through the
first stage. When the solvent in the final washer gets too dirty
for final cleaning, it can be replaced with clean solvent. The
dirty solvent removed from the final washer is used to replace
the solvent in the first stage sink. Only the very dirty solvent
from the first stage sink is shipped offsite as waste. This type
of cleaning is called two-stage washing; this process can reduce
solvent usage and waste generation significantly. </p>
<p>Finally, why use solvent? There are a number of cleaning
solutions that can replace solvents such as mineral spirits. Many
of these chemicals are not hazardous. Using nonhazardous
solutions may be your solution to reducing hazardous waste,
providing a safer workplace, and saving money.</p>

<h2 align="center">GEORGIA'S 1993 TRI DATA</h2>
<h3 align="center">GEORGIA MANUFACTURERS PASS THE 50% MARK IN
TOXIC CHEMICAL RELEASE REDUCTION </h3>
<p align="center"><strong>by Bill Vondersmith, Pollution
Prevention Engineer</strong></p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Spring 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>Annual Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) reporting is required
under section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community
Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) of 1986. EPCRA requires manufacturers
in Standard Industrial Classifications 20 through 39 with 10 or
more employees that manufacture, process, or use a listed toxic
chemical above specific threshold quantities to report multimedia
releases and off-site transfers to the state and EPA.</p>
<p>The 674 Georgia manufacturers submitting TRI reports for 1993
represent an increase of five percent over the 1992 reporting
while realizing an eleven percent decrease in emissions. Part of
the decrease can be attributed to the 947 source reduction
activities instituted by one-third of the manufacturers. The
majority of the activities reported dealt with operation and
maintenance, process modifications, and spill prevention (see
Figure 1).</p>
<p>&gt;From 1988 to 1993 Georgia companies have achieved an
overall reduction in TRI total releases of 55.6 percent (see
Figure 2). The total releases shown in Figure 2 are made up of
categories which include fugitive and stack air emissions, waste
water discharges, land disposal, waste water discharges to
Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW), and waste transferred off
site for disposal or recycling (see Figure 3). Releases in all of
the categories have decreased over the last four years with the
exception of land disposal which showed an increase. This
increase only represents six tenths of one percent of the 1993
total releases.</p>
<p>The largest reduction in actual pounds released occurred in
the stack air category where 1993 releases were 20.6 million
pounds less than the 1990 releases. Stack air currently
represents over fifty-five percent of the total annual releases.
Together stack and fugitive air emissions account for seventy
four-percent of the 1993 releases. Analysis of trends in the
release of some common solvents (such as benzene, methyl ethyl
ketone, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane) shows that solvent usage in
the state has declined. </p>
<p>Increased TRI reporting and total releases are anticipated
over the next two years due to the EPA adding 32 chemicals in
1994 and 286 in 1995 to the TRI list. These chemicals, while
previously regulated under other environmental laws, have not in
the past had their releases quantified. Expansion of the TRI
chemical list is expected to generate additional interest in
pollution prevention activities presenting new opportunities to
reduce pollutants entering the environment. Not only will this
reduce pollution, but in many cases companies will save money
implementing methods that reduce waste streams requiring costly
treatment and/or disposal.</p>
<p>The TRI data presented in this article was taken from
Georgia's Toxic Release Inventory Report, 1993 published by the
Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection
Division. Copies of this report may be obtained by calling (404)
656-6905.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b>Industrial Solid Waste Reduction Makes
$$$$$ and Sense</b> </h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by Susan Varlamoff, Outreach
Coordinator</strong></p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Fall 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>In just three years, McDonald's has implemented nearly 100
initiatives to reduce waste, recycle, and buy recycled products
in its 9,400 restaurants across the country. Together, these
initiatives have eliminated 7,500 tons of packaging annually,
saving the company $5 million dollars. Georgia-Pacific has worked
equally hard to get the most from every tree that comes into its
plant and mills. More than 200 waste minimization projects that
involve source reduction, improvements in processes and products,
and increased reuse, recovery, and recycling have resulted in $80
million in annualized savings.</p>
<p>While companies save on tipping fees by reducing and reusing
waste, recyclers are reaping near record high profits across the
country. According to a <i>New York Times</i> article on June 27,
1995, executives of garbage giant, Browning-Ferris Industries,
are cheering the good news as they bankroll increased revenues
for their stockholders by collecting and selling waste paper,
aluminum, glass, cardboard, and various other recyclables from
households and industry. (See inset for current market prices.)</p>
<p>However, before company managers empty their dumpsters
searching for materials to sell, it is more cost effective to
reduce or eliminate waste before recycling residuals. Any income
obtained from recycling cannot possibly offset the purchase price
of the original products. Typically, it costs 50 cents per pound
to buy steel while recycling revenues amount to only 2 cents a
pound. The most cost effective way to deal with solid waste is to
follow the waste management hierarchy:</p>
<pre>                          R E D U C E
                                
                           R E U S E
                                
			 R E C Y C L E</pre>
<p>During the first two years of P<sup>2</sup>AD's existence, the
technical staff has provided assistance to several hundred
companies ranging from a small auto body shop to Georgia-Pacific
Corp. On-site assessments have been done for a wide variety of
manufacturers. P<sup>2</sup>AD is currently focusing significant
resources in the following industry sectors: Pulp and Paper
Products, Chemical and Allied Products, Transportation Equipment,
Rubber and Plastic Products, Fabricated Metal Products, and
Printing and Publishing. </p>
<p>One pollution problem that P<sup>2</sup>AD found in common for
every company in every sector was solid waste. In fact,
industrial solid waste comprises the majority (57%) of the solid
waste stream produced in the United States (see graphic below).
Some companies, like pulp and paper mills, spend over 1 million
dollars each year for the removal of solid waste. In most cases,
a considerable amount of the solid waste produced by a company
can be reduced, reused in its processes, or recycled. </p>
<p>Generally, industrial solid waste can be classified as either
process waste or packaging waste. Waste can be caused by anything
from uncontrollable process inefficiencies to design limitations,
low raw material quality, inefficient plant layout, poor
housekeeping, and maintenance or operational neglect. It is
important to evaluate the nature of the waste and make the
necessary changes to reduce it.</p>
<h3><b>Process Waste</b></h3>
<p>If there are significant amounts of product in the dumpster,
there may be a process problem. Evaluating processes and altering
them to minimize the amount of waste produced will most likely
save money in the long term. In-house reuse of process wastes is
becoming a more familiar practice. Some printing companies have
&quot;closed the loop&quot; by recycling all their waste products
back into their operations.</p>
<h3><b>Packaging Waste</b></h3>
<p>Packaging waste, one example of the &quot;low hanging
fruit&quot; of waste minimization, is the easiest area in which
to begin reduction. A good way to reduce packaging waste at a
facility is to work with suppliers. Encourage them to take back
whatever packaging they sent or redesign packaging to minimize
material used. Some materials are sold in returnable totes.
Another way to reduce packaging is to work with customers.
Reducing packaging and shipping wastes will reduce both
production and disposal costs. Finally, whatever cannot be
reduced or reused should be recycled if possible. It is important
to speak with brokers and end users to be sure their quality
requirements can be met for a specific material. The Georgia
Department of Community Affairs (404-656-3851) can provide you
with their 1994 Recycling Markets Directory for Georgia.</p>

<h3 align="left">Industrial Solid Waste by Industry Sector</h3>
<h4><b>Pulp and Paper Products</b></h4>
<p>Solid waste is probably the most significant waste from pulp
and paper manufacturers in terms of disposal cost and volume.
Often, wood chips become contaminated with dirt or sand when they
fall from conveyors, rendering them unusable to make paper or as
a fuel. Bark that falls from logs waiting to be processed
similarly cannot be used as a fuel if contaminated with sand and
dirt. Oversized and undersized logs and limbs that cannot be
processed by mill equipment are also landfilled. The Mill Residue
and By-products Consortium is an industry-wide effort to identify
reuse opportunities for mill waste. Members include
representatives of many of the southeastern pulp and paper mills.
Contact Dr. Larry Morris at (706) 542-8356 for more information.</p>
<h4><b>Chemical and Allied Products</b></h4>
<p>Chemical manufacturers normally receive chemicals in metal and
plastic drums. These drums can be recycled throughout Georgia. It
might be worthwhile to request vendors to take back empty drums
also. Packaging waste in this industry includes wooden pallets
and plastic wrap. Wooden pallets can be recycled or sent back and
plastic wrap should be minimized.</p>
<h4><b>Transportation Equipment</b></h4>
<p>Packaging waste in the form of wooden pallets and cardboard is
a significant solid waste in this sector, and it can be recycled.
Also, paint cans are abundant solid wastes in this industry. The
paint must be used completely or left to dry out. Then the steel
can, in most cases, can be recycled. (In cases where great
amounts of paint are used, it is important to check with a
compliance officer at the Environmental Protection Division to
learn whether air drying is permitted.)</p>
<h4><b>Rubber and Plastic Products</b></h4>
<p>Those industries that produce liquid raw rubber for use in
manufacturing carpet backing and other rubber products generate
large quantities of sludge from wastewater treatment. The
technology exists to reclaim the rubber for reuse, but an
economically feasible system has not yet been developed to
perform this function. </p>
<p>More than 120 companies now reclaim and recycle used plastics
in Georgia. It is important to sort according to type and avoid
contamination to obtain the best market price. </p>
<h4><b>Fabricated Metals</b></h4>
<p>Steel scrap comprises a great amount of the waste produced by
this industry. To reduce the waste, the steel can be ordered in
widths that match the parts produced. Scrap should be reused for
other projects when possible. When several metals are used in one
operation, scrap should be segregated by type and recycled. Metal
shavings are often contaminated with oil during processing. Chip
wringers can be purchased to wring out the oil for reuse and make
the metal saleable.</p>
<p>Packaging waste consists of pallets, crating, drums, and
cardboard - all of which can be returned or recycled. For
companies with substantial amounts of cardboard, a baler should
be considered because the price of baled cardboard is
substantially higher than unbaled.</p>
<h4><b>Printing and Publishing</b></h4>
<p>A medium size printing company can easily fill a 40 cubic yard
dumpster per day with process waste. Trim, start-up strips, end
strips, or non-conforming product generated by companies that
print newspapers, flyers, cereal boxes, and snack food bags are
common solid waste, much of which is sent to the landfill. It is
possible to recycle much of this material. It is also possible to
reduce much of this waste by altering processes.</p>
<p>As disposal costs increase, discarded waste from one industry
for reuse by another is becoming more common. For this reason,
waste exchanges have been set up around the country. A waste
exchange is a service which promotes the use of one company's
waste for another's raw material. It publishes lists of wanted
and available materials/wastes, amount and form of waste, and
general geographic location. Waste exchanges can result in
savings to the donor through reduced disposal costs, and to the
recipient through reduced raw material charges. The following
exchanges will handle material for companies located in the
Southeast:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Southeast Waste Exchange - Charlotte, NC (704) 547-2767</li>
    <li>Southern Waste Information Exchange - Tallahassee, FL
        1-800-441-7949</li>
    <li>National Materials Exchange Network - Spokane, WA (509)
        466-1532</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest challenge to reducing waste is the ability of a
company to sustain a commitment to a program. However, in the
long run, solid waste reduction in industry will save money,
improve efficiency, and preserve natural resources and landfill
space. It's obviously a win-win situation for both industry and
the environment and worth pursuing.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b>Stormwater and Pollution Prevention
Conference for Truckers</b></h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by Paul Crumpler</strong></p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Fall 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>The American Trucking Association (ATA) and the Georgia Motor
Trucking Association (GMTA) hosted a workshop on stormwater and
pollution prevention for trucking facilities. About 30 Georgia
truck maintenance facility operators learned about stormwater
pollution prevention best management practices and how to file a
mandatory Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan. Minimizing
process wastewater discharges and general pollution prevention
topics for trucking facilities were also discussed. Each person
attending the conference also received a video cassette entitled
&quot;Developing Stormwater Best Management Practices.&quot;</p>
<p>A stormwater permit and a formal Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan are required for most motor trucking facilities
by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD). William
Salter of EPD discussed how to obtain a permit. The date for
obtaining a stormwater permit has passed for existing facilities.
If a company has not yet obtained a permit, EPD should be
contacted now to begin the permitting process. Mr. Salter can be
reached at 404-656-4887. A major requirement for obtaining a
storm water permit is to create a Stormwater Pollution Prevention
Plan or SWP3. SWP3s use best management practices for materials
and facilities to prevent stormwater from becoming contaminated.</p>
<p>Steve Hensly of the ATA and Michael Stieferman of Radian
Corporation presented discussions of advanced best management
practices or BMPs to reduce stormwater contamination. Stormwater
can become contaminated when rain mixes with oil, fuel, grease,
antifreeze, metals, and many other truck-related chemicals. BMPs
are developed to reduce the chance that stormwater will become
contaminated. The key is prevention. If oil and other truck
fluids are not spilled and they are stored away from rain, then
stormwater pollution is reduced. Storing oil containers indoors
is a BMP to reduce pollution. Another BMP is to build a cover
over fueling islands. Curbs can also be built around covered
fueling islands to prevent water from flowing through areas where
spills are likely. A critical BMP is to remove or cover storm
drains in areas where spills are likely. Most BMPs are very
simple. Placing catch pans under trucks leaking oil and not
sweeping oil absorbent into a storm drain are very simple
examples. Training employees to use these simple methods can
reduce pollution, save time, and save dollars.</p>
<p>BMPs can be developed for each location or process in a
facility. Fueling areas, maintenance areas, materials storage
rooms, and waste storage areas can all be sources of waste and
pollution. A team of employees should locate critical areas on a
map or plan of the trucking facility. Chemicals and other
materials stored or used should be listed; those that are exposed
to rain or water flow should be identified. Records should also
be reviewed to learn of past spills; inspections should be done
to learn of current leaks and spills. From this information, BMPs
can be developed that are unique for the facility. Worksheets and
instruction for developing BMPs and a Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan were provided to those attending the conference.</p>
<p>Paul Crumpler of P<sup>2</sup>AD provided a discussion of
process water pollution prevention practices. A number of
trucking facilities wash trucks or engine components. If washing
is done outside, the wash water eventually reaches a storm drain
or septic drain field. Water from truck washing is process
wastewater. Process wastewater should never be allowed to flow
into storm drains or septic drain fields. Process wastewater can
be minimized by using simple methods; attaching spring-loaded
hose nozzles to hoses used for truck washing will prevent the
hoses from being left running when not in use. High pressure
spray units can also be used to wash trucks; they use about half
as much water as a garden hose and provide better cleaning. Wash
water should be disposed of in a municipal sewer system. If a
facility is not connected to a sewer system, wash water can be
collected and recycled. Water recycling systems are becoming more
popular; facilities ranging from small self-serve carwashes to
large fleet operations have installed recycling systems. Contact
Paul Crumpler at 404-651-5120 or 800-685-2443 for more
information on water use minimization and recycling.</p>
<p>Karen Medlin of the ATA discussed pollution prevention for
trucking operations and the effects of BMPs on selling property.
Using good pollution prevention techniques and avoiding soil and
groundwater contamination by employing BMPs can help prevent
problems in selling property and obtaining financing on land
where trucking facilities are located. Pollution prevention can
reduce cost today by reducing waste and loss of raw materials.
Pollution prevention can also help maintain the value of
property. When property is sold, most purchasers or banks will
require a review of the land's previous uses, conduct site
inspections, and review environmental records of businesses
previously located on the property. The reviews will attempt to
find evidence of site contamination such as from spills, leaking
or hidden underground storage tanks, and septic systems misused
for process wastewater. </p>
<p>Ms. Medlin provides information on pollution prevention topics
for the trucking industry. She can be contacted at the American
Trucking Association at 703-838-1786. The video and information
package (including stormwater planning worksheets) can be ordered
from the ATA. Also, a limited number of videos are available by
contacting Jan Bunn at P<sup>2</sup>AD. The Georgia Motor
Trucking Association can also provide information on
environmental issues and other topics of interest to the trucking
industry. The GMTA can be contacted at 404-876-4313. We encourage
all trucking facilities to take advantage of these excellent
resources. </p>

<h2 align="center">Get Ready ... ISO 14000 is Just Around the
Corner</h2>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Summer 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>As the world economies have become more integrated, business
standards have continued to shift from a national to an
international focus. Regardless of the industry, there needs to
be a basis for the fair exchange of goods and services despite
the cultural, regulatory, and currency differences between
countries. The International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) has been a driving force behind this movement. You may have
noticed that ISO does not correspond with the organization's full
name. &quot;ISO&quot; is actually not an acronym, but derived
from the Greek word &quot;isos&quot;, meaning equal. ISO is a
global federation of standards organizations representing nearly
100 countries whose mission is to facilitate the exchange of
goods and services on a global level. ISO became the leader in
the arena of international standardization with the development
of the now familiar quality standards ISO 9000.</p>
<h3>Why international environmental management standards?</h3>
<p>There are many forces that have contributed to the movement
for common worldwide environmental management standards. Global
environmental problems, regulatory differences between nationals,
trade agreements, multi-national companies, and consumer demand
for environmental friendly products are just a few. Consumer
demand for environmentally friendly products in Europe and more
restrictive product laws in some European countries have in some
cases amounted to non-tariff trade barriers. U.S. participation
in the development of international standards will help to insure
that these European markets remain open to our exports. Depending
upon who's doing the estimating, the environmental regulatory
burden on the U.S. gross national product is anywhere from 3% to
8%. This places U.S. companies at a tremendous disadvantage when
competing against products from countries without such regulatory
burdens. This is fueling the current political trend towards
deregulation in the U.S. For industry, the adoption of
market-driven environmental management standards is an
opportunity to justify deregulation and level the international
playing field.</p>
<h3>Who is drafting the standards?</h3>
<p>ISO 14000 standards are being developed by the ISO Technical
Committee 207. There are 35 countries, including the United
States, who are members of this committee. The U.S. delegation is
being overseen by the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI). Representing the U.S. on the committees and work groups
are a host of professionals from industry, consulting,
government, and academia. The process of developing a standard
begins with each country formulating a national position. Next, a
working group creates a draft document. After approval at the
sub-committee level, a Committee Draft (CD) is circulated for
comment and then ballot. A Draft International Standard (DIS) is
then issued for final commenting. If you desire to know more
about the ISO process, contact ANSI at 212-642-4900.</p>
<h3>What are the standards?</h3>
<p>There are five primary standards in ISO 14000. Three of the
standards, Environmental Management Systems (EMS), Environmental
Auditing (EA), and Environmental Performance Evaluation (EPE),
are management related, and the Environmental Labeling and
Life-Cycle Assessment standards are product related. The EMS
Standard consists of specifications for policy, planning,
implementation, corrective action, and management review for an
environmental management program. The EA Standards are guidelines
for audit procedures and auditor qualifications. The EPE Standard
provides direction in the evaluation of systems and determination
of performance.</p>
<p>The Environmental Labeling Standard is intended to harmonize
legal and cultural differences between countries in product
labeling. Issues addressed are third party certification/seal
programs and manufacturer self-declarations. Exactly what
information is to be contained in ecolabels has been an area of
significant debate. As a result, this standard has not progressed
as far through the process. The Life-Cycle Assessment Standard
specifies the use of life-cycle tools in product evaluation to
improve environmental performance. A life-cycle assessment is a
study of the impact on the environment resulting from the
production and use of a product from the extraction of raw
materials to the final disposal of waste. Some concerns at issue
in the development of ISO 14000 include the cost of
implementation, non-recognition by regulating agencies,
application to under-developed countries, trade barriers, and
disclosure of audit information during certification. Committee
Drafts (CD) may be obtained from ANSI (212-642-4900) or ASTM
(215-299-5487). The Draft International Standards (DIS) that were
approved at the Oslo meeting in June should be available by
August.</p>

<h3>Will ISO 14000 affect me?</h3>
<p>How do I know if my company needs ISO 14000 certification? Ask
yourself these three questions: Does my facility export products?
Does it supply foreign companies operating in the U.S.? Does it
supply other manufacturers who in turn export products? If you
answer yes to any of these questions, chances are you will be
hearing a lot more about ISO 14000 in the future.</p>
<h3>What can be done now?</h3>
<p>Although there will not be any finalized standards until next
year, beginning to prepare now will give you a head start for ISO
certification. The first standards to be completed will be EMS
and environmental auditing. These standards are the furthest
along in the process and are the least likely to change.
Preparing for the EMS Standard can be done without extensive
effort, and may translate into immediate benefits. The EPE, LCA,
and labeling standards are further from reaching a finalized
form.</p>
<p>Most heavily regulated industries in the U.S. should be well
prepared for the EMS Standard. The EMS Standard can be viewed as
a blueprint for an environmental management program or as a means
of bench marking an established program. To achieve EMS
certification you will need to have an environmental policy,
identify environmental aspects related to the operation, show
regulatory compliance, have objectives and targets that address
all environmental aspects in a manner consistent with the
environmental policy, define responsibilities, and provide
appropriate training. Procedures need to be established for
maintaining communication, documenting activities, maintaining
operational control, monitoring and measuring key aspects and
activities, taking corrective and preventive action, and
maintaining records. Finally, the system must be audited
periodically with managerial review of the system to ensure
continual improvement.</p>
<p>From a marketing standpoint, benefits associated with an
effective EMS include meeting the customer's environmental
expectations and certification criteria, enhanced image and
product recognition, and access to more markets. In the
manufacturing operations, an EMS will provide better cost
control, more efficient management of resources, and reduce
potential liabilities. Liability limitation will also lower
insurance costs. An EMS can improve access to capital by
demonstrating due diligence and satisfying investor criteria.
Externally, an EMS can improve industry-government relations,
expedite permitting processes, and help maintain good public
relations.</p>

<h2 align="center">Partner Approach to Resource Management</h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by Tony Knick, Department Manager,
Synthetic Industries, Inc.</strong></p>
<p align="center">[Summer 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>Synthetic Industries (SI) is taking resource management
seriously. Our company is making a commitment to be an
environmentally responsible manufacturing firm by managing our
resources for maximum efficiency and minimum waste. Recently, we
have taken yet another step towards protecting the environment.
Working in a partnership with the Georgia Pollution Prevention
Assistance Division (P2AD), SI formed a program called
S.I.E.R.R.A., which stands for Synthetic Industries Environmental
Resource Reduction Action. The S.I.E.R.R.A. program will carry on
the past recycling and waste minimization efforts at SI, and
contribute to the continuous improvement efforts of the Synthetic
Quality Mission (SQM).</p>
<p>The Chickamauga facility, which was recently ISO 9002
certified, has been selected as the pilot location for the
S.I.E.R.R.A. program. As part of S.I.E.R.R.A., eight employee
teams have been formed to focus on reducing and reusing materials
ranging from office paper and cardboard to lubricants and
packaging products. The teams collectively utilize the talents of
personnel from operations, maintenance, management, engineering,
accounting, and purchasing. Over forty employees are actively
participating in the program. Our corporate plan is to build the
S.I.E.R.R.A. program at Chickamauga, and then implement it at all
SI locations.</p>
<p>A primary goal of the program is to reduce the amount of solid
waste sent to the local landfill 50% by 1996. During the course
of 1994, solid waste contributions to the landfill have been
reduced by 22% over the previous year. This reduction was
achieved through activities such as collecting and chopping bale
wire, enabling 633,720 lbs. of metal that was previously
unrecovered to be recycled. With the aid of outside recycling
partners, we are helping turn more than 10 million pounds of
polypropylene waste each year into such useful items as picnic
tables, benches, automotive parts, plastic lumber, plastic
pallets and, appropriately enough trash cans. In addition to
recycling efforts, SI continually seeks to use the most
environmentally friendly items available, including the use of
aluminum tubes instead of paper tubes in several different
applications. The aluminum tubes have a longer service life and
are easily recycled at the end of their useful life.</p>
<p>While the paper/plastics, wood, cardboard, and metals teams
are continuing to seek opportunities to reduce solid waste, the
process water and gas/air teams are working to conserve water and
energy resources. The vendor service team is exploring
cooperative waste minimization opportunities with suppliers and
customers. The approach taken by the teams is to identify wastes,
determine quantities and costs of the wastes, investigate
alternatives that reduce the waste, and use financial analysis to
chose the best solution. At SI, the more we examine our daily
processes, the more ways we find to reduce waste!</p>

<p>In the last issue, we asked how you reduced or eliminated
cleaning prior to painting. The following is a list of
suggestions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Improve housekeeping. Keep paint area free of
        contamination. Avoid handling of parts by employees prior
        to painting. </li>
    <li>Determine if cleaning is necessary. In some cases, the
        substrate is clean enough to paint without additional
        cleaning. </li>
    <li>Avoid using materials with protective coatings that must
        be removed prior to painting, such as preservatives used
        to protect products while in storage (i.e., oils, grease,
        and silicone). Vendors often ship materials with
        protective coatings. Work with these vendors to reduce
        the use of such coatings. In some instances, materials
        that require painting can be replaced with color-matched
        injection molding.</li>

<p>In the last issue, we asked how you replaced 1,1, 1-
trichloroethane in your cleaning operations. The following is a
list of the responses that we received.</p>
<ul>
    <li>One company kept the contamination out of their process
        by improving their housekeeping, thereby eliminating the
        need to clean. </li>
    <li>Southwire Machinery Division (SMD) in Carrollton replaced
        1,1,1 with an alkaline cleaner that is applied using a
        heated pressure washer system. </li>
    <li>Additional replacements include terpene blends and
        water-based cleaning systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is not one drop-in replacement that will work for every
cleaning operation. Disadvantages associated with using an
alkaline solution as well as the other alternatives may exist .
For more information about solvent substitution or how to choose
the best replacement, contact P2AD's Information Manager, Jancie
Hatcher at (404) 651-5120 or 800-685-2443.</p>

    <li>Conducting a statewide HHW survey</li>
    <li>Developing educational material, including a series of
        brochures and handouts </li>
</ol>
<p>As first discussed in the Winter 1994/95 issue of From the
Source, the Division created the HHW Work Group in January of
this year. The mission of this work group was to provide the
Director of P<sup>2</sup>AD with recommendations on the
feasibility of a state-sponsored program which would reduce
household hazardous waste generation in Georgia. The workgroup
was comprised of 15 citizens representing government, trade
associations, retailers, and environmental groups.</p>
<p>The workgroup developed recommendations which were available
for public comment until August 7, 1995. The highlights of the <a
href="Hhw.htm">Final Report</a> (September 22, 1995) include the
following five recommendations in no particular order:</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should serve as the lead state agency for HHW
prevention and management. P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop
guidelines for conducting HHW prevention and management programs.
P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote pollution prevention of HHW
through various public education programs, such as incorporating
HHW educational materials into existing school curricula. P<sup>2</sup>AD
should (as funds are available) fund several pilot household
hazardous waste collection programs in the state. These projects
would hopefully provide information to the state regarding the
feasibility of various types of collection events. P<sup>2</sup>AD
should create and/or promote collection for certain HHW items.
(Recommendations made by the workgroup are non-binding.)</p>
<p>The second activity focused on household hazardous waste is a
statewide survey. P<sup>2</sup>AD and the Georgia Environmental
Protection Division (EPD) are working with Georgia State
University's Applied Research Center to develop the survey. The
purpose of the survey is to 1) determine the public's perception
and level of knowledge about household hazardous waste and 2)
gain a better understanding of current disposal practices and
homeowners' interest in a community household hazardous waste
program in Georgia. The survey will also serve as an evaluation
tool to design a program and act as a baseline to measure the
projects' success. The results of this survey should be available
by late December.</p>
<p>Finally, P<sup>2</sup>AD is in the process of developing a
series of technical and educational material, including brochures
for local governments and the general public. Since the mission
of P<sup>2</sup>AD focuses on pollution prevention, materials
will follow the waste management hierarchy of prevention, reuse,
recycle, and proper disposal or treatment, and will focus on
eliminating improper disposal of household hazardous waste.</p>
<hr>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD's Information Center contains numerous
articles on household hazardous waste including educational
materials, brochures, case studies, and publicity paraphernalia.
To learn more about household hazardous waste or for a complete
list of the resources available on the subject, contact Stephanie
Siniard at (404) 651-5120 or 800-685-2443.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b>What Can P</b><sup><b>2</b></sup><b>AD's
Information Center Do For Me?</b></h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by Jancie Hatcher, Information Manager</strong></p>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Fall 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the common questions asked of P<sup>2</sup>AD's staff
is &quot;What services can you provide to me and my
business?&quot;. This article is the first in a series which will
answer that question. The focus of this issue's article is on the
Information Center (Center).</p>
<p>The Center strives to be your one-stop source in Georgia for
pollution prevention and source reduction information. One phone
call (404-651-5120 in the Atlanta calling area or 1-800-685-2443
from outside the metro area) will connect you to the Center.
Jancie Hatcher or another staff member will talk with you and get
an understanding for the type of pollution prevention information
you and your business need and want. In addition to providing the
types of information described below, the staff may also refer
you to one of P<sup>2</sup>AD's engineers for consultation or
on-site assistance. If you have Internet access, the Information
Center can be reached through e-mail at: <a
href="mailto:p2ad@ix.netcom.com"><i>p2ad@ix.netcom.com</i>.</a></p>
<p>After you have initially contacted P<sup>2</sup>AD, a wide
variety of resources from the Center are available to you. The
Center includes a library with over 2300 documents, journal
articles, and books pertaining to pollution prevention,
recycling, and household hazardous waste. All documents have been
abstracted and catalogued in a database to allow easy searching
for specific topics. The staff can provide you with a
bibliography of library holdings for your area of interest.
Single copies of most materials or referrals to other sources of
documents (such as EPA's Pollution Prevention Information
Clearinghouse) are also available free of charge. Although
materials do not circulate as in a traditional library, all
materials are available for public access and use during normal
business hours.</p>
<p>In addition to books and reports, the Center also maintains
over 40 current periodical subscriptions. Journals which contain
general environmental topics include Environment Today,
Environmental Solutions, and EPA Environmental Policy Alert.
Topical journals include Industrial Paint &amp; Powder, Pulp
&amp; Paper, and Precision Cleaning, and publications of regional
interest include Georgia Environmental News, Georgia
Environmental Law Letter, and the Atlanta Business Chronicle.
Pertinent pollution prevention articles from these journals are
also listed in the library's database for quick access.</p>
<p>A third part of the Center's collection consists of over 50
videos. There are videos available on such topics as parts
cleaning, solvent alternatives, corporate pollution prevention
programs, and vehicle maintenance. A public viewing area at P<sup>2</sup>AD's
offices is open during normal business hours.</p>
<p>In addition to its in-house resources, the Center also has
access to a wide variety of outside knowledge. The staff
routinely accesses the holdings at the Georgia Tech and Georgia
State University libraries. P<sup>2</sup>AD also uses the
services of the Waste Reduction Resource Center (WRRC), a
regional source for pollution prevention information funded by
EPA and the Tennessee Valley Authority. P<sup>2</sup>AD keeps a
current listing of WRRC's library holdings on computer for easy
identification of pertinent documents they may have that the
Center does not. P<sup>2</sup>AD's staff also use the Internet
(World Wide Web, gopher sites, etc.) to research specific client
needs.</p>
<p>Clearly, the P<sup>2</sup>AD Information Center has a lot of
reference material that could be useful in integrating pollution
prevention into YOUR business! The staff works hard at answering
your pollution prevention questions in a timely manner. We invite
you to try out the Information Center for yourself, and we look
forward to serving you.</p>

<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Fall 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>Environmental management costs have become a significant
portion of the total operating budget for many companies. In
order to remain competitive, companies must find cost-effective
ways to identify and resolve environmental issues affecting their
operations. There is a new weapon available to help companies in
the fight to control these costs.</p>
<p>The Southeastern Environmental Resources Alliance (SERA) is a
non-profit organization created to provide information, technical
assistance, and implementation services to small and medium-sized
companies. SERA was established as a joint effort by the U.S.
Department of Energy, Westinghouse Savannah River Company, and
the states of South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>SERA clients in Georgia will have access to the technical
assistance services available through several existing
organizations. Georgia Tech's Economic Development Institute
(EDI) will provide on-site assessments focusing on energy
efficiency, environmental compliance, and basic pollution
prevention issues. P<sup>2</sup>AD will provide assistance to
SERA clients to resolve complex pollution prevention problems.
The University of Georgia's Department of Biological and
Agricultural Engineering will serve as the primary provider of
technical assistance to small and medium-sized companies in the
areas of pulp and paper, textiles, and food processing.</p>
<p>In addition to providing on-site technical assistance, SERA
will participate in industrial trade shows and conduct industry
specific workshops. Through these events, SERA will seek to bring
the latest information on cost-saving waste management measures
to companies throughout Georgia. SERA will also serve as a
mechanism for transferring advanced environmental and waste
management technologies developed at the Savannah River Site to
industrial facilities in Georgia and South Carolina.</p>
<p>The goal of SERA is to use technical assistance and technology
transfer to improve the competitive position of companies that
otherwise would not have access to such services. For more
information on the resources available through SERA, please
contact Ms. Jancie Hatcher, P<sup>2</sup>AD information manager,
at (404) 651-5120 or 800-685-2443.</p>

<h2 align="center">P<sup>2</sup>AD to Recognize Industry P<sup>2</sup>
Leaders</h2>
<p align="center">[<em>From the Source - </em>Summer 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>An advisory working group has recommended that P<sup>2</sup>AD
establish a program that recognizes and rewards companies that
excel at pollution prevention. The Recognition Criteria Work
Group was created by P<sup>2</sup>AD Director G. Robert Kerr to
recommend guidelines for a state-sponsored pollution prevention
recognition program. </p>
<p>The work group recommended the formation of two categories of
recognition: a certification program and the Governor's Award.
The certification program would be a non-competitive,
multi-tiered program that recognizes continuous performance and
improvement. The three levels in order of increased achievement
would be: entry, achievement, and model. The Governor's Award
program would recognize outstanding pollution prevention projects
by a company, individual, organization, academia, or a government
agency. Unlike the certification program, the Governor's Award
would be competitive. A company's environmental compliance
history would be considered in each recognition category.</p>
<p>The work group recommended that companies that achieve
certification should be publicly recognized. Companies that reach
the achievement or model level should be eligible for some type
of regulatory relief and/or financial incentives in the form of
reduced fees, expedited permitting, or reduced reporting or
inspections. The principal award in the Governor's Award program
should be primarily public recognition.</p>
<p>&quot;The underlying objective of the program should be to
encourage pollution prevention in Georgia industries by
recognizing companies that are good at it,&quot; said Work Group
Chairman Lee Thomas of Georgia Pacific.</p>
<p>&quot;The staff of P<sup>2</sup>AD will now use the
recommendations and continue to work with the public to develop
the recognition program,&quot; said P<sup>2</sup>AD Director Bob
Kerr.</p>
<p>The work group was made up of 14 citizens representing a cross
section of industry, government, and environmental groups. The
work group members are Lee Thomas, chairman; Peter Bonacum, Roy
Bowen, Elizabeth Brock, Rep. Denny Dobbs, Laurie Fowler, Carol
Foley, Win Hill, Pete Howard, Bruce Miller, Steve O'Day, Wesley
Wolff, Bob Woodall, and David Word.</p>

<h2 align="center">P2AD, Pollution Prevention, and the Internet</h2>
<p align="center"><strong>by Mike Garruto, P.E., Pollution
Prevention Engineer</strong></p>
<p align="center">[Summer 1995]</p>
<hr>
<p>P2AD has found the Internet to be an extremely useful and cost
effective work tool, particularly the electronic mail (e-mail)
and World Wide Web (WWW) features. As most of you may not use the
Internet yet, I will provide some reasons why you may want to
explore it. There is a wealth of information available, including
resources on the topics of pollution prevention and waste
minimization. Unlike the past, using the Internet is now a simple
process with user friendly software and typical monthly
connection charges of $15 to $30. Of course, a fairly up-to-date
computer and modem are also requirements while local phone call
access to the Internet service provider helps keep costs down.</p>
<p>An Internet account will quickly pay for itself if you use the
e-mail feature to eliminate many overnight carrier charges and to
reduce long distance phone bills due to reduced fax machine use.
Text, spreadsheets, CAD drawings, graphics, and sound files can
be sent locally, nationwide, or around the globe to one person or
several almost instantaneously using Internet e-mail. </p>
<p>Please note that P2AD's e-mail address is <a
href="mailto:p2ad@ix.netcom.com">p2ad@ix.netcom.com</a>, and we
will be responsive to requests for information and services
through our e-mail in addition to the more traditional phone
contacts and personal meetings. One benefit of e-mail has been
the ability to increase our knowledge base by taking part in an
electronic mailing list comprised of P2 technical assistance
programs throughout the country. When confronted with a
challenging situation, P2AD's technical staff can pose questions
to experts throughout the country who may be aware of possible
solutions or previous research in the area.</p>
<p>One feature that is driving the explosive growth in Internet
use is the World Wide Web. The WWW basically provides access to
multimedia files provided by other Web users. Information
accessed may be supplied by government agencies, educational
institutions, private companies, not-for-profit groups, and
individuals. With the click of a mouse button, users can move
from one Web location to another throughout the world.</p>
<p>Recently P2AD, in conjunction with the Department of
Administrative Services, established a presence on the World Wide
Web at <bold>http://www.dnr.state.ga.us/P2AD/</bold>. It is our intent to
continually improve this online service to make it as useful as
possible to the public. Therefore, we welcome any and all
questions, comments, and suggestions.</p>
<p>Our Internet Web pages have several highlights. First, our
home page includes an introduction to P2AD. A home page typically
has graphics like the front cover of a book, an abstract about
the individual or organization, and a menu similar to a table of
contents. A second feature is the online availability of our
newsletter, &quot;From the Source.&quot; In addition, P2AD
provides the public with easy access to draft reports of work
group recommendations covering topics that affect how P2AD can
best serve its mission. Announcements for upcoming seminars,
society meetings, conventions, and training opportunities are
also accessible. Finally, P2AD is providing a page of
&quot;pointers,&quot; known as hypertext links, to other
pollution prevention and environmentally related servers. This
page can serve as an excellent starting point for research on a
variety of topics. To give you an idea of the type of information
available from these servers, I am providing a small sample of
worthwhile sites. If you already have Internet access, consider
using our home page as a timesaving means of linking to these
servers. If you have no idea what the Internet and World Wide Web
are all about, just talk to one of the millions of users to help
you get started. For those who have no interest in the Internet,
P2AD will still be able to utilize the Internet's resources to
help you by using it to communicate with experts and to research
specific topics related to your concerns. When you do visit our
web pages, please e-mail us with your suggestions or favorite
sites!</p>

<p><a name="Introduction "><strong>Introduction</strong> </a></p>
<p>The purpose of this report is to identify the specific causes
of waste generation, and cost-effective solutions that will
reduce waste in the pulp and paper industry in Georgia. The
benefits of reducing waste are reduced pollution and decreased
operating cost to the business. Releases of high-priority toxic
chemicals are the primary focus of this report but other
significant solid and liquid wastes will be included. Barriers
exist that limit the implementation of pollution prevention
projects and technologies. Barriers and strategies to overcome
them will also be discussed in this report. </p>
<p><a name="Methodology"><strong>Methodology</strong></a> </p>
<p>Review of trade and environmental publications indicated that
the processes responsible for Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)
releases in this sector are primarily Kraft pulping and bleaching
of pulp. Businesses that use these processes were identified by
reviewing 1993 TRI reports and the Georgia Manufacturing
Directory. There are relatively few pulp and paper mills in
Georgia. Telephone interviews were conducted of Kraft pulp mills
and paper mills in the state. Visits were made to six mills;
various processes related to Kraft pulping, bleaching, and
recycling were reviewed. The interviews and plant visits were
conducted to collect information on the various types of
equipment and chemistries used in the mills. Water usage, pulp
production, and information on various other wastes were
collected. Mill environmental and production staffs were also
questioned about programs at their facilities to reduce waste and
evaluate new technologies available to the pulp and paper
industry. The results of this study are presented in this
document. </p>
<p><a name="Summary"><strong>Summary</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The following key issues were identified as a result of this
study through contacts with Georgia pulp mill personnel, mill
tours, interviews with paper industry experts, and review of
various trade and environmental publications. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Lack of Facility Pollution Prevention Programs </li>
    <li>Water Use Reduction and Reuse </li>
    <li>Lime Mud Waste Reduction </li>
    <li>Energy Conservation and Recovery </li>
    <li>Alternatives to Chlorine Bleaching </li>
    <li>Log Yard Waste Reduction</li>
</ul>
<p>The Georgia Pollution Prevention Assistance Division (P<sup>2</sup>AD)
will assist Georgia pulp and paper manufacturers in addressing
these key issues by developing various programs. P<sup>2</sup>AD
will work with existing technical and business organizations to
provide training, publication of fact sheets and case studies,
and conduct applied research demonstration projects in order to
address critical pollution prevention issues. </p>

<h3><a name="Profile"><strong>Profile of the Pulp and Paper
Manufacturing Sector in Georgia</strong></a> </h3>
<p>Georgia pulp manufacturers produce pulp, bleached pulp, or
specialty pulp for the food and pharmaceutical industry. Many of
these companies also produce finished paper, paperboard, or
linerboard. Twenty-four companies are listed in the Georgia
Manufacturers Directory within SIC code 26 that are predominately
involved in cellulose pulp manufacturing. Approximately 13,000
people work for these manufacturers. A list of these businesses
is provided below in Table 1 with a description of the primary
products and number of employees. </p>

</table>
<p>Of the 24 manufacturers in Georgia, thirteen are large
manufacturers of pulp only, pulp and paper, or pulp and
linerboard. These manufacturers produce virgin pulp and form a
finished paper product. The pulp may be either bleached or
unbleached. Four Georgia mills produce bleached virgin pulp. Pulp
is also sold to paper manufacturers that make paper, filter
paper, or other specialty paper from pulp. There are
approximately 100 companies in Georgia that are primarily paper,
paperboard, or paper products manufacturers that do not
manufacture pulp. These companies are not the focus of this
study. </p>
<p>Another manufacturing group repulps old corrugated cardboard,
linerboard, newsprint, and other waste paper. There are at least
nine mills producing recycled pulp in Georgia. Recycling mills
manufacture pulp for sale to other industries or manufacture a
finished paper product. Some recycling mills deink printed stock
using floatation or continuous deinking. Bleaching is done
primarily with peroxide and less with sodium hypochlorite by
recyclers. At least one company recycles newsprint and other
paper in a dry repulping process to make insulation, animal
bedding, and reseeding material used on highway right of ways. </p>
<p>Paper mills need a source of water and a receiving body to
dispose of wastewater. Paper mills are generally located near a
river to provide a means of disposal for the often tremendous
wastewater stream generated by the mill. A secondary reason is to
provide water for mill usage since a number of mills use wells as
the primary source of mill supply water. Cooling water is also
needed and is usually supplied from surface water. All Georgia
mills have wastewater treatment plants except some of the small
specialty product mills, and dispose of wastewater directly to a
river after treatment. At least one mill disposes of wastewater
to a municipal treatment system. Several mills also purchase
water from a city or other source of treated water. </p>

<h3><a name="Processes"><strong>Pulp and Paper Industrial
Processes</strong></a><strong> </strong></h3>
<p>In order to understand the pulp and paper industry, a general
description of the pulping and paper making process is needed.
Each of the companies uses some or all of these processes. </p>
<p><strong>Wood Yard Operations</strong> </p>
<p>Wood is delivered to a pulp mill either as logs or chips. Logs
are delivered with the bark attached to prevent loss of moisture
and other degradation. Logs are handled in the yard by cranes or
log trucks. They are loaded onto a conveyor or log flume where
they are carried to a debarker and chipper. Chips are screened to
remove over and undersized chips, and then stored in the yard
awaiting digestion. The majority of the Georgia virgin pulp mills
have wood yards. A growing trend is to eliminate wood yards and
receive chipped wood only. Several mills receive only wood chips
or are planning wood yard closure in the near future. </p>
<p><strong>Water Treatment </strong></p>
<p>Pulp mills generally require a large amount of water in
processing to remove lignin and bleaching byproducts. Water is
generally obtained from rivers or wells. From 5,000 to 40,000
gallons of water is required to produce one ton of dry pulp in
Georgia's virgin pulp mills. This water is treated prior to use
to remove suspended solids and other contaminants. </p>
<p><strong>Digestion </strong></p>
<p>Chips are heated by steam and white liquor is added. The
liquor impregnated chips then enter the digester where they are
heated to cooking temperature. Spent cooking liquor or black
liquor is removed from the brownstock after cooking. In batch
digesters, the brownstock is blown from the bottom of the
digester vessel prior to washing. In a continuous digester,
washing takes place inside the digester to remove liquor and cool
the pulp. In either case, brownstock is washed to remove the
majority of spent liquor. It is also screened to remove
undigested knots. The majority of the 13 pulp mills use the Kraft
process. One mill uses the thermo-mechanical pulping process. </p>
<p><strong>Washing</strong> </p>
<p>Pulp washing takes place after each major process. The purpose
of washing is to remove undesirable elements from the pulp
stream. Black liquor, fines, lignin, and bleach byproducts are
removed after each processing step. Washer efficiency can be
measured by the cleanliness of the pulp and the amount of water
used to achieve that level of cleanliness. There are a number of
different types of washers available. Vacuum drum brownstock
washers (six-stage or three-stage) were the industry standards up
to the 1970s. At least six Georgia mills currently use vacuum
drum washers. Pressure brownstock washers represent a later
washing technology with at least one mill using this technology.
Diffusion brownstock washers are currently the industry
standards, but diffusion washers are also being improved upon.
Diffusion washers are used by at least three mills. At least two
pulp mills in Georgia use Chemi washers, which are the most
efficient washers available currently. Each improvement
represents cleaner pulp with a water usage reduction. </p>
<p><strong>Refining</strong> </p>
<p>Pulp passes through slots in rotating plates to separate the
cellulose clumps into fibers and condition the fibers for paper
making. Essentially, the fibers are cut to a uniform length
during refining which reduces strength. The fibers are also
conditioned by refining which improves bonding and strength of
the finished paper product. </p>
<p><strong>Oxygen Delignification</strong> </p>
<p>Some mills have installed an oxygen stage to further remove
lignin from the brownstock as a prebleaching step. Reduced lignin
content produces a whiter pulp. Oxygen and white liquor are added
to the brownstock in a heated reactor where additional
delignification takes place. Lignin compounds freed as a result
of oxygen delignification are removed in washing and extraction
stages. At least two Georgia mills use oxygen delignification.
Oxygen delignification reduces the amount of chlorine or other
bleaching chemicals required to whiten the pulp in the bleach
stage. </p>
<p><strong>Extended Delignification </strong></p>
<p>Various extended delignification techniques are used to remove
more lignin prior to bleaching. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and heat
act to break complex bonds in the lignin to make them soluble in
water or volatile. NaOH and heat also break bonds in the
cellulose reducing strength and yield. Extended delignification
techniques cook the wood chips at lower temperature for longer
periods of time to remove lignin with reduced damage to the
cellulose. Several techniques are in use to control temperature
and liquor chemistry in the digester. At least four mills in
Georgia use extended delignification. Extended delignification
reduces the amount of bleaching chemicals required in the
bleaching stage to produce the same pulp whiteness. </p>
<p><strong>Bleaching </strong></p>
<p>Bleaching usually takes place in a multistage process. The
purpose of bleaching is to remove lignin without damaging the
cellulose. One process is the DED process; D represents chlorine
dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>) and E represents extraction. In this
process, brownstock is mixed with ClO<sub>2</sub> in the D1
reactor which further reacts with lignin in the pulp. Washing
follows to remove the chlorinated lignin compounds from the pulp.
NaOH is added to the pulp stream in the E tower and is followed
by washing in a press. Extraction neutralizes the pulp and
improves subsequent washing. The D2 tower is the last stage of
bleaching where ClO<sub>2</sub> provides the final whitening of
the pulp. If preceded by oxygen delignification, the process is
abbreviated ODED. Chlorine (C), peroxide (P), oxygen (O), sodium
hypochlorite (H), and ozone (Z) are other chemicals that can be
used in various configurations. For example, ODEoD would consist
of: </p>
<p align="center"><em>oxygen reactor &gt; ClO</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em>
reactor &gt; extraction with oxygen added (EO) &gt; ClO</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em>
reactor</em> </p>
<p>The final stage of bleaching is often used to whiten or
lighten remaining lignin. Eight Georgia mills bleach pulp in some
manner, four of which are virgin pulp mills. </p>
<p><strong>Paper Making</strong> </p>
<p>The pulp is then transported to the paper machine where a pulp
mat is formed on a screen. Water is removed from the sheet by a
combination of vacuum, heat, and pressure applied through
rollers. The finished paper can be made in a variety of weights
and is rolled onto large rollers for shipment to other processing
plants. Paper is sometimes coated on the paper machine with
kaolin to provide a white surface or has a binder added to
increase wet strength. Some binders contain formaldehyde; many
companies have replaced these with nonformaldehyde binders. Other
coatings and binders contain ammonia or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA).
Approximately 17 mills in Georgia produce paper, paperboard, or
similar products. </p>
<p><strong>Power Boiler </strong></p>
<p>Energy in the form of heat and steam is generated by burning
waste wood from the log yard or fossil fuels. In addition to
steam, electricity is also often generated on-site at pulp mills.
Pulp and paper mills require a large amount of energy to operate. </p>
<p><strong>Liquor Recovery Cycle</strong> </p>
<p>NaOH and sodium sulfide (Na<sub>2</sub>S) are the primary
pulping chemicals. NaOH reacts with lignin in the wood to release
the cellulose fiber. Na<sub>2</sub>S buffers the reaction to keep
the solution caustic, and aids in the removal of digested lignin
by increasing its solubility. Spent cooking liquor, or black
liquor contains various organic and sulfur compounds in addition
to the reactive pulping components of NaOH and Na<sub>2</sub>S.
The black liquor is removed from the pulp at various locations
after the delignification process and concentrated in an
evaporator. The concentrated liquor, or strong black liquor is
combusted in a furnace along with sodium sulfate (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)
to recover Na<sub>2</sub>S, and sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>)
in the form of ash. This ash is mixed with water and lime (CaO).
The resultant reaction forms green liquor and replenishes the
original pulping chemicals NaOH and Na<sub>2</sub>S; calcium
carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>). CaCO<sub>3</sub> is precipitated
from the green liquor in a clarifier and converted back to CaO in
a lime kiln. After removal of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, the green liquor
becomes white liquor. The recovery cycle consists of a liquor
evaporator, recovery boiler, clarifier, and lime kiln. </p>
<p><strong>Wastewater Treatment</strong> </p>
<p>Wastewater gathered from various mill processes is treated
prior to discharge to reduce biological oxygen demand (BOD),
chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total suspended solids (TSS).
Wastewater typically passes through a primary clarifier to remove
the bulk of the cellulose fibers lost during processing and other
solids. Wastewater then passes through aeration ponds to further
reduce BOD and COD. Nutrients in the form of ammonium nitrate or
ammonia are often added to encourage microbe activity. Wastewater
is then discharged directly to a river or tidal river. Wastewater
volumes are very large ranging up to 40,000,000 gallons per day
with relatively low contaminant concentrations. In addition to
BOD, COD, and TSS, color and chlorinated compounds such as dioxin
have been of great concern to pulp mills. Aeration and
clarification do not significantly reduce color or chlorinated
compounds. </p>
<p><strong>Waste Paper Recycling</strong> </p>
<p>Another segment of the industry repulps cardboard or newsprint
into recycled paper or paperboard. Recycled material is repulped
by adding water, sodium hydroxide, and heat. The pulp is then
made into a finished paper product on a paper machine in the same
manner as a virgin paper mill. Deinking and bleaching are also
done at some recycle mills. Floatation is one common method of
deinking. Peroxide is commonly used in the bleaching process.
Approximately nine Georgia mills are involved in repulping waste
paper products. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Characteristics">Waste Stream and Generation
Characteristics of Georgia Pulp and Paper Manufacturers</a> </h3>
<p>Wastes are generated by the industrial processes used by
Georgia pulp and paper manufacturers. Almost all of the wastes
generated are derived from unusable portions of the tree such as
bark and lignin. Additional wastes are generated from power
generation or from the chemicals used in pulping, bleaching, and
chemical recovery. Energy is also a waste stream. Water entering
the mill is heated for process use. Thermal energy is emitted to
the environment from numerous sources. </p>
<p>The usable portion of a tree is cellulose from which paper is
made. Other materials such as turpentine are byproducts which
have a market value. Most other components are released to the
environment as solid waste, liquids, gasses, or energy derived
from combustion. </p>
<p><strong>Toxic Wastes</strong> </p>
<p>Toxic wastes reported on the 1993 TRI totaled more than 18.8
million pounds of which 16.4 million pounds were released to the
air. TRI releases for 1993 are shown in Figure 2. Of the 26
chemicals reported, methanol was released in the largest quantity
at approximately 9.3 million pounds. Methanol is generated from
pulping at the rate of 12 to 20 pounds per ton of production in
the Kraft process. Bleaching can increase that amount up to 25
pounds. Thermo-mechanical pulping also releases methanol, but in
much lower quantities at about 0.5 pounds per ton of pulp.
Methanol and other organics (MEK, acetone, etc.) are released
primarily from process vents, but are also found in wastewater
and the recovery furnace stack. Wastewater leaving the mill can
contain large amounts of the methanal; biological destruction of
methanol is estimated to be in excess of 99% in wastewater
treatment plants. Non-contact recovery boilers available since
the 1970s reduce methanol stack releases to near zero. Newer and
modernized facilities collect and combust process vent gasses in
the recovery boiler, lime kiln, or power boiler furnaces reducing
methanol and sulfur releases. Older facilities still have
uncontrolled process vents releasing significant amounts of
methanol. </p>
<p>Noncondensable gasses are usually burned in the lime kiln or
recovery boiler. Mills have traditionally avoided burning
noncondensable gasses in the recovery boiler due to an increased
risk of an explosion. Some mills have lime kilns which cannot
meet the capacity required to burn all noncondensable gasses, or
have significant downtime due to mechanical failures. The result
is increased emissions of sulfur and organics when the kilns are
used to combust noncondensable gasses. Burning noncondensable
gasses in the kiln also decreases the lime recovery capacity,
thus increasing solid waste in the form of disposed lime mud. A
few mills have begun to burn noncondensable gasses in recovery
furnaces to take advantage of their greater capacity. </p>
<p>Sulfuric and hydrochloric acids are also released by pulp
mills. These materials are combustion byproducts from coal-fired
boiler operations. Sulfuric acid is also used in paper making and
other mill processes to adjust pH. Zinc is another material
reported that is nonpulp related. Zinc is contained in ash from
burning tires as a boiler fuel. Tire burning for energy recovery
is a popular tire recycling or disposal method. </p>
<p align="center"><strong>FIGURE 2 - 1993 GEORGIA TRI RELEASES BY
PULP AND PAPER MANUFACTURERS IN POUNDS</strong></p>
<p align="center"><img src="pulp1.gif" width="447" height="280"></p>
<p>Chlorinated compounds such as chloroform are emitted from
wastewater and bleach plant process vents. Chloroform is
primarily associated with the use of sodium hypochlorite and
chlorine bleaching. Mills generally have replaced both of these
materials to some degree. Hypochlorite use is discontinuing.
Chlorine is being replaced either partially or fully by chlorine
dioxide. Ozone is also used in place of chlorine on a limited
basis in other states. For these reasons, chloroform emissions
have decreased. Dioxin is another chlorine related pollutant.
Dioxin levels in effluent from mills that have switched to 100%
chlorine dioxide are usually below detectable levels. Chlorine
dioxide has replaced chlorine completely, 100% substitution, in
three Georgia mills. Several other mills have replaced 20% to 30%
of the chlorine used for bleaching with chlorine dioxide. </p>
<p>Chromium and dichloromethane are two chemicals reported from
Georgia mills on the 1993 TRI. These are nonpulp related and are
due to specific situations that occurred at particular mills. </p>
<p><strong>Solid Waste</strong> </p>
<p>Solid waste generation by pulp and paper manufacturers varies
between 0.01 and 0.26 tons of waste per ton of product (TPT). The
wide diversity is due to several factors. Lime mud and wood yard
debris can be large solid waste streams. The sources of these
wastes are log handling and insufficient capacity lime kilns.
Some mills have sufficient lime kiln capacity and thus produce
small amounts of waste. Other mills have reduced wood yard waste
by purchasing wood chips and eliminating log storage. Other solid
wastes typical in pulp mills are wastewater treatment sludge and
digester knots. Sludge and knots are reused in some mills and
disposed of in others. </p>
<p>Solid waste is usually disposed of in on-site landfills; some
mills use municipal or private landfills. Disposal costs are
often very high, exceeding $2 million annually in some mills
whether on-site or off-site. Some municipal landfills used by
pulp mills have closed. As on-site landfills reach capacity,
several mills are considering building new landfills. New
landfills can cost $10 to $20 million to open and are not an
attractive option to most pulp mills. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Wood Yard Waste </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Wood yard waste generation by Georgia pulp and paper
manufacturers varies between 0.02 and 0.06 TPT. Oversized logs,
wood debris, decayed wood, sand, soil, and bark are typical
wastes. Wood waste can be burned in power boilers if soil and
sand are removed. Much of this material is landfilled, or used in
the landfill as cover material. Wood chips that are burned for
energy are still considered waste by most mills if originally
intended for pulping. Several mills indicated that wood yard
waste was the largest solid waste stream from their facilities. </p>
<p>Chip making also generates some wood waste. Knots and
undersized chips are removed from the chip screen. These
materials, along with bark, are usually used as fuel. Clean,
palm-sized bark chunks have a high market value as a landscaping
material. Some mills sell bark for landscaping. Sawmills and
other bark sources that traditionally sold this material to pulp
mills for fuel have diverted the landscaping suitable bark to
other markets. The smaller, dirtier bark is sold to mills for
fuel use. Soil and other debris in this bark must be removed
prior to burning or after as increased ash volume, thus creating
additional waste. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sludge </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Various mill sludges are also disposed of as solid waste but
are derived from wastewater treatment systems. Primary and
secondary clarifier sludges consist of dirt, debris, and
cellulose. This material is intentionally rejected due to being
out of specification or accidentally due to inherent
inefficiencies in the pulp washing systems. At each washing or
refining stage, some usable pulp is lost even after passing
though save-alls. Deinking sludges are generated from recycling
plants and consist of inks, clays, soils, and some cellulose
fiber. Mills sometimes dry and burn the sludges for energy
recovery and volume reduction. Deinking sludge will have
approximately 50% of the energy value of bark. Sludges are
sometimes applied to forest or farm land partially as a disposal
method and partially to recover nutrients. Sludge generation is
reported to be 0.02 to 0.06 TPT. Some pulp mills indicated that
improvements have been made in reducing the amount of cellulose
inadvertently sent to wastewater treatment. As the cellulose
content in sludge is reduced, sludge volume decreases. The sludge
generated is then less useful for traditional recycling options
such as reuse in ceiling tile manufacture or as fuel. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ash</strong><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>Ash is generated due to combustion. Coal, bark, wood, tires,
and sludge are burned producing varying amounts of ash due in
part to the amount of noncombustibles in the materials. Ash is
disposed of in landfills or has some limited reuse. Wood and bark
ash are sometimes used agriculturally for their liming potential.
Ash generation rates are approximately 0.04 TPT from Georgia pulp
mills. Ashes from different fuels will have varying metal
content. Ash from burning tires will contain zinc. Some pulp
mills in Georgia burn only wood and bark; other mills primarily
burn some mixture of coal, wood, fuel oil, or natural gas. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lime Mud </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Lime mud is also disposed of as a solid waste. Pulp mills have
lime kilns for regenerating lime mud from the liquor recovery
process. Often lime kiln capacity does not meet mill requirement,
thus requiring disposal of lime mud and purchase of fresh lime.
Waste lime mud generation is only related to kiln capacity, not
production. Waste lime mud generation of up to 200 tons per day
is reported. Other lime related wastes are green liquor dregs and
slaker grits in relatively low volumes. Burning of noncondensable
gasses in lime kilns can also increase the volume of grits and
dregs generated. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Undigested Knots</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Knots generated in the digester and are resin-loaded pieces of
wood that are not fully digestible due to poor impregnation with
cooking liquor and high lignin content. This material is
separated from digested pulp in various screening operations.
Some mills mechanically break the knots down and reintroduce them
to the digester or pulp stream. Other mills dispose of knots as a
solid waste or burn for energy recovery. Undigested knots also
contain black liquor and are a source of air emissions. </p>
<p><strong>Wastewater</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Process Wastewater </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Water is the largest raw material input in the pulp and paper
industry. Georgia integrated brownstock mills will use 5,000 to
12,000 gallons per ton of production. Bleached pulp mills in
Georgia have water usages ranging from 13,000 to 25,000 gallons
per ton; approximately 50% is used in the bleaching process.
Specialty pulp mills can approach 40,000 gallons per ton. Recycle
mills also use a considerable amount of water. The lowest water
usage noted during this study was 810 gallons per ton at
Sweetwater Paper Board, a corrugated recycling mill located in
Austell, Georgia. The highest usage was over 17,000 gallons per
ton in a recycling mill with deinking processes and bleaching. </p>
<p>Wastewater as previously discussed can contain methanol,
chlorinated compounds, cellulose, and other materials. Wastewater
removes undesirable material from the process and carries them to
a treatment system to partially concentrate and remove,
stabilize, or destroy those materials that could damage the
environment prior to releasing the water. Wastewater is generated
in every washing stage, as well as in the woodyard and chemical
generation. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Storm Water </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Storm water may be affected by chipping dust that escapes as
fugitive releases from the chipper or chip piles. Bark, debarking
dust, and other woody debris are lost around the edges of
woodyards. This material was obviously present on the ground
around some manufacturing plants visited. Storm water
contamination with wood dust is not likely to cause long term
problems such as ground water contamination, but can prompt
complaints from neighbors, block storm drains, and foul standing
water. Storm water runoff is often captured and treated. Wood
yard areas and areas where pulp or pulping chemicals are spilled
do contribute to storm water pollution and increased treatment
costs. Mills typically collect and treat storm water from outside
production and storage areas. Increased BOD is the primary storm
water pollutant. </p>
<p><strong>Hazardous Waste</strong> </p>
<p>Hazardous waste is generated by pulp mills but not in large
quantities. Maintenance wastes from degreasing and painting are
typical waste sources. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Barriers ">Pollution Prevention Barriers </a></h3>
<p><strong>Economic Barriers</strong> </p>
<p>The greatest barrier to pollution prevention in the pulp and
paper industry is economic. A pulp mill is a large scale, mostly
in-line production process composed of large and expensive
devices. In-line production means that all of the product passes
through each process component. If one piece fails, then the
entire mill ceases to function. There are exceptions. Older mills
tend to have many batch digesters while newer and upgraded mills
use one or two continuous digesters. Process change becomes
riskier as mills move more to in-line production. </p>
<p>A large integrated pulp mill producing 2,000 tons per day of
product will cost almost $1 billion to construct if built today.
Recovery boilers can cost up to $100 million for new
installations. In addition to expensive equipment, the product is
very expensive. Virgin bleached pulp prices have been in excess
of $1,000 per ton. Upgrades to a pulp mill could require many
weeks of construction. A single week of downtime could cost $14
million in lost sales. For these reasons, changes in technology
are not implemented until the risk of failure is very low and
economic payback high. </p>
<p>Newer pulping technologies are definitely more efficient that
older technologies. Due to the cost of equipment and upgrades, it
is difficult to justify major changes or replacement of entire
systems until the working life of existing equipment has been
reached. </p>
<p><strong>Technological Barriers</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Kraft Pulping</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>The Kraft process is the leading pulping technology in
Georgia. Mechanical pulping is used at one mill. Kraft pulping in
many ways has remained unchanged; wood, water, energy, NaOH, and
Na<sub>2</sub>S are the traditional process inputs. Wastes
generated are methanol and other various organic chemicals, solid
waste, wastewater, sulfur compounds, and waste heat. Reduction in
pollution has resulted primarily from pollution control measures
such as combustion of vented gasses and scrubbing combustion
stack gasses. Equipment modification to improve boiler combustion
efficiency has also reduced emissions. Pollution prevention
techniques have resulted in improved recovery of NaOH and Na<sub>2</sub>S,
reduced water usage, and reduced energy usage. Even with these
improvements, the Kraft pulping process will continue to produce
organic waste. Environmental pollution reduction from the Kraft
process will continue to be primarily capture and control since
there are few if any methods available for eliminating pollution
at the source. Use of catalysts and enzymes in pulping represents
the first new technology changes in many years. Catalysts are
discussed later in the report under Alternatives to Chlorine
Bleaching. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bleaching and Pulp Washing</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, pulp washing and bleaching are continuing
to change to reduce waste. Economic barriers and some technical
barriers still exist in implementing pollution prevention
technologies in bleaching and pulp washing, but there appears to
be a steady evolution of these processes to reduce waste and
cost. </p>
<p>Technological evolution in bleaching is evident by reviewing
the existing bleaching technologies in 1995 compared to 1970.
Bleaching began almost exclusively using chlorine and sodium
hypochlorite. Due initially to dioxin concerns in the 1980s,
alternatives to chlorine were researched and implemented.
Chlorine dioxide has now either totally or partially replaced
elemental chlorine and sodium hypochlorite. Oxygen and peroxide
are also now used in bleaching and prebleaching stages. In
addition, various methods to improve delignification in the
pulping stage have been developed which reduce the dependence
upon chlorine in bleaching. </p>
<p><strong>Organizational Barriers</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lack of Pollution Prevention Programs</strong><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>The typical pulp or paper mill in Georgia does not have a
program in place to evaluate wastes and develop methods of
reducing. The primary focus of pulp mill personnel is to keep the
mill in production by meeting quality, production, and
environmental regulatory mandates. Mill personnel are extremely
busy; tasks beyond the normal scope of work are commonly handled
by using consultants. Pulp and paper mills use external
consultants for environmental and design services. Through
organizations such as the Technical Association of the Pulp and
Paper Industry (TAPPI), the National Council of the Paper
Industry for Air and Stream Improvement (NCASI), the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other pulp and paper
trade associations, technologies that improve environmental
performance are well known to both mill personnel and
consultants. For this reason, new mills are constructed with
leading edge technologies; many older mills have also upgraded.
Several pulp and paper manufacturers have corporate programs to
reduce waste. In general, these programs are designed to identify
and evaluate those leading edge technologies. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lack of Waste Accounting</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the more mundane aspects of waste minimization and
pollution prevention are overlooked. Mills have various means of
accounting for waste generation, but these methods mostly focus
on major waste steams. Ash generation, sludge generation, solid
waste generation, and overall water usage are known. Specific
sources of waste and water usage are unknown. Georgia pulp mills
generally account for waste generation and cost as overhead. Most
mills have not attempted to trace waste generation back to
individual processes. In some of the mills, water usage was only
known as a total volume. Flows to individual processes, and waste
materials contributed to the wastewater stream by individual
processes are unknown. Approximately 50% of the Georgia pulp
mills have formal pollution prevent plans to evaluate waste and
implement waste minimization methods. Even the mills with formal
pollution prevention programs tend to look toward the
technological solutions and not the simpler methods such as
materials management. The simpler methods often require a
significant investment of time to develop and implement, but can
have very large financial returns. </p>
<p>Air emissions by pulp and paper mills are calculated using
emission factors or they are measured. Emissions factors provide
an estimate of the amount of a chemical emitted per ton of pulp
production. Emission factors are based on the type of equipment
used to produce pulp. For example, the emissions factor for
estimating methanol emissions from a batch digester and blow tank
will be greater than the emissions factor for a continuous
digester on a per ton basis. NCASI, EPA, and other organizations
publish emissions factors. Emissions calculated by using
emissions factors may be higher or lower than measured values
depending upon a number of factors. The general state of repair
of equipment can also affect emissions; additional emissions due
to failures may not be calculated when using emissions factors
according to some mill personnel. In one facility, the pulp
washer appeared to have some seal damage in an access door
emitting steam, liquid, and odor. Other mills had darkly colored
liquid streams escaping from pulp washers and storage areas. In
every case, the liquid was collected in sewers for treatment at
the mill's treatment plant. Air emissions from these failures may
not be estimated by using emission factors according to some pulp
mill personnel. The use of emission factors does not seem to
provide an incentive for repair of relatively minor system leaks
such as these. Measurement of emissions may not provide an
incentive either since emissions from leaks or failures would be
only measured if sensors were located in close proximity or were
intentionally measured. Leaks from equipment in disrepair do
increase operating cost and actual emissions. Preventive
maintenance and leak repair should be included in all pulp mill
procedures. Mills that have few leaks, few spills, and maintain a
high level of housekeeping may release fewer air emissions than
mills that do not maintain equipment or housekeeping as well.
However, reported emissions for the two situations may be the
same based on stack measurements or emissions factors. </p>

<p>The Herty Foundation is an authority of the State of Georgia
that offers contractual research and development to the pulp,
paper, and nonwoven industries. The University of Georgia also
offers the use of a 20 ton per day pulp mill for research of
ozone, chlorine free, enzyme assisted, and other bleaching and
deinking technologies. </p>
<p><strong>Corporate and Facility Pollution Prevention Programs </strong></p>
<p>Several of the Georgia mills use their corporate engineering
and technical resources to reduce waste. Other plants have mill
personnel who measure and characterize waste streams with the
goal of reducing waste. Whether using corporate or plant
personnel, some mills actively track waste generation to the
source and seek ways to reduce. A case study is attached in
Appendix I describing Weyerhaeuser's approach to waste
minimization. Tenneco, Weyerhaeuser, Georgia-Pacific, Fort
Howard, Southeast, Federal, Gilman, and Rayonier are some of the
major pulp and paper manufacturers in Georgia with waste
minimization programs. In each case, the specific goals and
methods may be very different depending upon the organization. </p>

<h3><a name="Key">Key Pollution Prevention Issues</a> </h3>
<p>The following key issues were identified through contacts with
Georgia pulp mill personnel, mill tours, interviews with paper
industry experts, and review of various trade and environmental
publications. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Lack of Facility Pollution Prevention Programs </li>
    <li>Water Use Reduction and Reuse </li>
    <li>Alternatives to Chlorine Bleaching </li>

<h3><a name="Facility"><strong>Lack of Facility Pollution
Prevention Programs</strong></a><strong> </strong></h3>
<p>A number of mills do have formal pollution prevention plans
while others do not. Some of the mills are part of wider
corporate pollution prevention plans. The goals and methods used
are different for each program. Regardless of goals and methods
used, the plans should all include waste audits that track waste
streams back to the source and estimate total costs associated
with the waste streams. Once costs are known, specific projects
can be identified that can be justified for their cost reduction
potential. Discussions with plant and corporate personnel
indicated that many of the plans do not include this basic
requirement. </p>
<p>Some of the plans were directed toward long-term technology
goals such as zero discharge of wastewater or total chlorine free
bleaching. These goals are necessary, but may be realized in 10
or more years. All current paper making technologies will not be
replaced with long-term technology changes. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Water"><strong>Water Use Reduction and Reuse</strong></a> </h3>
<p>Water is used by all pulp, paper, and recycling mills in
significant quantity. There are a number of processes which use
water and generate waste water, but the primary uses are pulp
washing following digestion and bleaching, and deinking and
washing in recycling mills. Since most water used by a pulp mill
is heated prior to use, reducing water usage can very
significantly reduce energy usage. Energy costs and savings are
often the most significant aspects of water usage reduction
programs. </p>
<p><strong>Brownstock Washing </strong></p>
<p>Pulp washing is usually done in either of four washing
systems, vacuum drum, pressure, diffusion, or Chemi. A brief
description of each is provided below. Washing is done to remove
cooking chemicals and to remove lignin breakdown byproducts as a
prerequisite to pulp drying, bleaching, and paper making. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vacuum Drum Washing</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Vacuum drum washers usually consist of three to six
counter-flow stages. Each stage consists of a rotating screen
drum which has a partial vacuum applied to the interior. The drum
sits in a tank where pulp is diluted with wash water. The vacuum
draws a pulp mat against the surface and wash water through the
mat. The drum rotation advances the washed pulp mat to the next
dilution tank. Wash water discharged from this wash stage is sent
to the previous washing stage. At least six Georgia mills use
vacuum drum washers. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pressure Washing</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Pressure washing is similar to vacuum drum, but differs by
spraying water under pressure through the pulp mat as the drum
rotates. At least one mill in Georgia uses pressure washing. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Diffusion Washing </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Diffusion washing is a counterflow process that takes place in
one or more stages. Pulp flow is upward and is carried on a
perforated plate; water flow is downward through a series of
baffles. This method offers a high degree of cleaning with low
water use. At least three mills use diffusion washers in Georgia. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chemi or Belt Washing</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>A Chemi or belt washer is perhaps the simplest washing system
design and offers reduced water usage with excellent cleaning.
Belt washing is a counter flow process where pulp enters the
washer area on a wire belt. Washing takes place under a series of
showers. Clean water enters on the opposite end from the pulp and
is sprayed vertically through the pulp. The used wash water is
then collected and reapplied to the dirtier pulp by the next
washing head countercurrent to the direction that the pulp moves.
This process is continued through at least seven stages until the
wash water is saturated with liquor after washing immediately
incoming pulp. The wash water is then sent to the recovery
process. Two mills in Georgia are known to use Chemi washers.
Reduced dilution of the liquor recovered from washing will result
in reduced energy usage in the recovery process. </p>
<p>The effluent from brownstock washing contains black liquor
that must be recovered in addition to varying amounts of water.
Diffusion washing and belt washing can reduce the amount of water
used per ton of pulp in brownstock washing by 50% or more
according to published data. However, the mills in Georgia do not
show order of magnitude reductions when using the newer washing
technologies. Comparison between mills is difficult due to
product mixes of virgin and recycled pulp; mills that have
replaced vacuum drum washing with diffusion or belt washing
report that improved cleanliness or water reductions were
achieved with the new technology, but exact figures were not
available. Improved cleanliness is important in reducing
bleaching load. </p>
<p><strong>Costs of Pulp Washing With a Chemi Washer</strong> </p>
<p>Although several mills in Georgia have upgraded pulp washing,
specific information on cost and water usage was not available.
In the EPA's document, Pollution Prevention Technologies for the
Bleached Kraft Segment of the U.S. Pulp and Paper Industry, the
following estimate was provided. </p>

        <td width="50%">Payback Period</td>
        <td width="20%">4.25 to 4.9 years</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>Due to the long payback period, replacement of vacuum drum
washers with a Chemi washer is more feasible in a new
installation or when a new washer is required to replace a vacuum
drum washer that has reached the end of its service life. The
installation cost does include all support facilities such as a
building to house the unit and piping. The actual replacement
cost would be less if support facilities were already existing.
Also, the operating cost reduction does not include savings in
the bleaching stage. Improved washing will result in less lignin
in the pulp thus reducing bleaching requirements. </p>
<p><strong>Bleach Mill Effluent Reduction</strong> </p>
<p>Washing of brownstock prior to bleaching allows the recovery
of wash effluent in the recovery boiler. Once the pulp has gone
through a chlorination stage, recovery is not practical due to
corrosiveness. Improved washing and increased delignification
prior to bleaching decreases bleaching load and reduces the load
placed on wastewater treatment. Bleach mill effluent reductions
can then best be achieved prior to any chlorination stage.
Improved delignification can allow bleached pulp mills to
eliminate certain bleaching and extraction stages while achieving
the same level of brightness. Elimination of a bleaching stage
can reduce water usage by 2,500 gallons per ton of pulp
production. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bleach Mill Effluent Recycling</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Several mills and corporate organizations are exploring reuse
or are reusing bleach mill effluent in previous bleaching stages.
Bleach mill effluent accounts for approximately 50% of a bleached
Kraft mill's water usage with effluent streams from each stage of
bleaching. Recycling water to previous stages could reduce water
usage by 60% depending upon the bleaching configuration.
Wastewater from bleaching and pulping will contain methanol,
other organics, and chlorinated compounds. Reuse in uncontrolled
areas could increase air emissions. Typically, a mill will
recycle white water from the paper machine back through the
various bleaching stages in a counter-current process. </p>
<p><strong>Other Water Use Reduction Opportunities</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Process Pump Seals</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Seal water used in various pumps has been eliminated by
replacing with mechanical face and lip seals in several
facilities around the state. Seal water flows are typically not
very high, but are continuous and can add up to large volumes
over time. Replacing water seals with mechanical seals usually
increases energy consumption due to friction. Seal water can also
be collected and reused for other processes but may contain
contaminants from the chemical passing through the pump. </p>
<p>Seals are also a source of air emissions, water pollution, and
raw material loss due to leakage of the material being pumped
through the seal. Chemical pump seals are being investigated by
some mills for replacement with sealless and magnetically coupled
pumps. An example of a sealless pump is a diastolic tube pump.
Magnetically coupled pumps transmit power from the motor to the
pump with a magnetic field. Traditionally, both designs are
better suited for low torque applications. In either case,
sealless pumps are not new technology and should work well in the
pulp industry. </p>
<p>Union Camp in Savannah has replaced water lubricated seals
with mechanical seals. According to an article published in the
November 1995 issue of &quot;Pulp and Paper,&quot; replacement of
braided packing seals with a self-lubricating compound has
reduced water usage and equipment failure. The compound used is a
&quot;colloidal mixture of lubricants amalgamated with Aragraphe
fibers&quot; manufactured by Tom-Pac of Montreal, Canada. The
sealing compound also allows leaks to be repaired by injecting
more compound into the seal. Replacement of water lubricated
seals also reduces the potential of bearing and gearbox
contamination with water, and seal water contamination with oil
or other materials. Union Camp points out that 95% of the seal
replacement projects have been successful. The benefits of this
waterless sealing compound to Union Camp have been: </p>
<ul>
    <li>reduced water usage</li>
    <li>reduced equipment damage</li>
    <li>reduced water contamination</li>
    <li>reduced maintenance time</li>
</ul>
<p>Vacuum pumps are used to supply vacuum to vacuum drum pulp
washers and other mill equipment. Vacuum pumps are typically
liquid ring pumps which use water for sealing and cooling. Water
usage is continuous and can be high depending upon the size of
the pump. Liquid ring vacuum pumps represent the common
technology used in hospitals and other facilities needing large
vacuum volumes. In resent years, oil-free and oil-flooded rotary
screw pumps have been used in some cases to replace liquid ring
pumps to reduce water usage in hospitals. This technology may be
useful in the paper industry to replace liquid ring vacuum pumps.
Water discharged from liquid ring pumps should be suitable for
reuse in any number of mill applications, but may contain some
process contaminants. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>White Water Recycling</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Paper machines can generate significant amounts of wastewater.
One mill generated 3,000 gallons per ton of paper. White water is
typically clean, but may contain some contaminants such as fiber,
lignin compounds, and various organics. Some of Georgia's pulp
mills are recycling paper machine water back to bleaching or
pulping operations. Where bleaching does not exist, white water
from the paper machine can be reused or partially reused directly
in pulp washing or in the wet end of the paper machine. One
Georgia mill recycling corrugated material reuses all white water
after clarification. The sludge that settles during clarification
is also reintroduced into the process. The company, Sweetwater
Paper discharges approximately 810 gallons per ton of pulp
produced. </p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
    <tr>
        <td width="100%">
        <p align="center"><strong>Case Study -- Recycling of
        White Water at Sweetwater Paper</strong> </p>
        <p align="left">Sweetwater Paper produces wallboard
        backing made from recycled paper. The paper is not
        deinked. Waste paper is repulped; new backing board is
        then made on a paper machine. Water removed from the
        board during sheet forming and drying is sent to a
        wastewater treatment plant where it undergoes
        clarification and pH adjustment. The majority of the
        water is then recycled with a small discharge of 180
        gallons per minute. Sweetwater manufactures approximately
        320 tons per day of wallboard backing. </p>
        <p align="left">Calcium sulphate is the most problematic
        component in the recycled water stream. Calcium sulphate
        is brought into the plant as a component of the waste
        paper. If the concentration becomes too great, calcium
        sulphate crystals can form within the plumbing system
        resulting in blockage. Sweetwater maintains solubility by
        adjusting pH and limited water discharge to prevent
        crystallization. Sweetwater discharges 810 gallons per
        ton of product, which is two to four times lower than is
        expected for this type of mill. In addition to recycling
        water, clarifier sludge is added back to the process. The
        only solid waste generated is from foreign materials such
        as plastic strapping present in the incoming waste paper. </p>

<h3><a name="Chlorine  "><strong>Alternatives to Chlorine
Bleaching</strong> </a></h3>
<p><strong>Waste Generation </strong></p>
<p>Wastes of greatest concern from bleaching are chloroform and
dioxins. Elemental chlorine and sodium hypochlorite are the two
bleaching chemicals most associated with chloroform and dioxin
formation. For this reason, most mills have eliminated sodium
hypochlorite and replaced chlorine to some degree. Of the six
virgin bleached Kraft pulp mills in Georgia, three have replaced
elemental chlorine with chlorine dioxide. The other three have
substituted varying amounts of chlorine dioxide. </p>
<p>Bleaching, as previously discussed, is a multistage process.
Historically, bleaching was considered a separate process from
digestion and began with a chlorine stage. Currently, with
elemental chlorine use in decline, it is more difficult to define
where digestion or delignification ends and bleaching begins.
Some of the pollution prevention options discussed below perhaps
are closer to delignification than bleaching in historical terms.
In either case, the basic purpose of bleaching is to further
selectively delignify pulp. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chlorine Dioxide Substitution</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Georgia pulp mills have proven that 100% chlorine dioxide
replacement for elemental chlorine is technically and
economically feasible. Mills nationally have reported pulp
quality improvements by switching to chlorine dioxide. Some mills
using less than 100% chlorine dioxide report that increases in
substitution rate are not economically feasible. The lack of
economic feasibility seems to be related to equipment costs as
opposed to chlorine dioxide cost. Replacement or upgrade of
washers, bleach tower materials, and chlorine dioxide generators
were all mentioned as needed prior to increasing substitution
rates at these mills. Full substitution can also cause reduced
pulp yield and reduced brightness according to some published
data. </p>
<p>Chlorine dioxide costs more than elemental chlorine. Even with
chlorine dioxides greater reactivity, chlorine dioxide can cost
more than eight times as much as elemental chlorine according to
EPA documents. It is estimated by the EPA that the total cost of
generating one pound of chlorine dioxide is approximately $0.50.
The cost of an equivalent amount of chlorine is $0.06. In a 1,000
ton per day mill operating at 11% substitution, an increase to
50% substitution would cost $5 million initially with an increase
in operating costs of $1.9 million annually or $5.40 per ton.
Increasing to 100% substitution would cost $15.9 million
initially with an increase in operating cost of $7.1 million
annually or $20.30 per ton. Considering that pulp prices can
approach $1,000 per ton, 100% substitution represents an increase
in operating cost of about 2%. These estimates are based on
general averages and not one particular mill. </p>
<p>Reducing dependence on chlorine bleach can best be achieved
prior to bleaching. Bleaching is basically an extended chemical
delignification process. Chlorine is used to selectively
delignify pulp without causing the damage to cellulose that
traditional pulp digestion causes. The key to reducing chlorine
use is to find methods which delignify further prior to the
bleaching stage. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Chip Uniformity</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Uniform, thin chips achieve a greater degree of
delignification in standard or modified cooking processes by
allowing the chip charge to reach a predictable amount of
digestion using a specific chemical and thermal mix. Various
methods are available and include improved screening and
rechipping of oversized chips. This is a lower cost option for
improved delignification with or without bleaching. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Extended Delignification </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A number of methods exist for improving delignification
without extensive cellulose degradation. At least four mills in
Georgia use extended delignification techniques. These techniques
are primarily applicable to continuous digesters. New digesters
can cost upwards of $15 million. Some Kamyr digesters, which are
the most common type, can be refitted at costs reported in the $1
million range. Batch digesters can also be refitted in some
cases. Reduced operating cost by refitting results in payback
periods of approximately 18 months according to EPA documents.
The cost savings are reported to be in steam and reduction in
bleach chemical usage. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Oxygen Delignification </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Oxygen delignification requires the addition of a reaction
tower between the brownstock washers and bleach plant. Oxygen and
sodium hydroxide is added to brownstock. Reduction of bleaching
chemistry by 50% can be achieved in the bleaching process if
preceded by oxygen delignification. Washing follows oxygen
delignification; effluent can be recovered or discharged. At
least two Georgia mills use oxygen delignification. Cost of
building a new oxygen delignification tower can be in the $10 to
$30 million range, but may be offset by reducing bleaching needs.
Operating costs have been estimated to decrease by up to $3.70
per ton for softwood and to increase by up to $6.65 per ton for
hardwood based on studies conducted in Sweden and published by
the EPA. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ozone Delignification and Bleaching</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Ozone delignification is not used by any Georgia mills; only
one full-scale mill operates within the U.S. Ozone
delignification is similar to oxygen delignification. The Union
Camp mill in Franklin, Virginia, began operation in 1992 with an
OZEoD extended delignification and bleaching process at 1,000
tons per day of bleached kraft production. The overall
installation cost was $113 million. Operating costs of the OZEoD
delignification and bleaching process are reported to be about
50% less when compared to the more conventional CEDED or DEDED
process. D represents chlorine dioxide, E represents extraction,
O represents oxygen, and Z represents ozone. There is one pilot
mill in Georgia capable of ozone delignification and bleaching.
The mill is operated by the University of Georgia for the use of
the school and industrial customers for research. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Alternative Chemicals Used in Bleaching</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Chlorine and chlorine dioxide are the only bleaching chemicals
used in Georgia by virgin Kraft pulp mills. Oxygen and peroxide
are used to augment sodium hydroxide extraction. Oxygen and
peroxide act to delignify in the extraction stage essentially
replacing chlorine in later stages. Sodium hydrosulfite is used
by one mill in a bleaching operation producing newsprint. No
Georgia mills use ozone in bleaching, although ozone bleaching is
used in a pilot mill in South Carolina and a full-scale mill in
Virginia. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Enzyme Bleaching</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Enzymes are used by wood eating insects and bacteria to break
lignin bonds or to delignify pulp. Xylanase is an enzyme family
related to the chemicals secreted by such bacteria; it appears to
be useful in pulp bleaching, extended delignification, and
deinking. Mills nationally have used this chemical in trial runs;
results indicate that up to 50% reductions in chlorine
requirements can be achieved without damage to the cellulose.
Application of xylanase appears to be simple. Following
brownstock washing, xylanase is applied to the pulp as it enters
the high density storage tank. Xylanase works in the high density
storage tank and requires between 30 and 180 minutes of reaction
time. A washing stage follows the xylanase treatment. No Georgia
mills report using xylanase, but it appears to be a low cost
method of achieving significant results. Other enzymes such as
mannanase are being investigated. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Catalyst Improved Delignification </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Anthraquinone </p>
<p>Anthraquinone is a pulping reaction catalyst which was found
to increase the speed of pulping, increase yield, and reduce
pulping chemical usage by up to 10%. Anthraquinone is one of the
few new technological discoveries in the Kraft pulping field. Due
to cost, anthraquinone has not been used extensively in the U.S.
except in testing. Approximately 100 mills worldwide use
anthraquinone. Although developed as a pulping pollution
prevention technology, it may have greater use and be more cost
effective if used as an aid to extended delignification. The cost
of anthraquinone is expected to drop in the near future due to
patent expiration. Renewed interest may develop as a result.
Anthraquinone has been estimated to increase pulping costs by
approximately $5.00 per ton, but with increased yields of 0.75%
and reduced recovery boiler loading. An increase yield of 0.75%
represents an increase in production of 7.5 tons per day in a
1,000 tons per day mill. </p>
<p>Polysulfide </p>
<p>Polysulfide is another catalyst mentioned in trade magazines
applicable in pulping. Yield increase of 1.5% are possible with
improvements in strength. It is possible to use both
anthraquinone and polysulfide together. TAPPI publications report
that yield increases of approximately 2.5% are possible. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Log"><strong>Log Yard Waste Reduction</strong></a> </h3>
<p><strong>Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<p>Log yard waste is for some mills the largest solid waste
stream. Mills with on-site landfills will often use some of this
material as landfill cover, but there is often more waste than
needed for this purpose. Log yard wastes are typically bark and
woodchips mixed with soil, oversized logs and undersized limbs,
metal-containing logs, and mold damaged chips. Energy usage in
the form of fuel for log handling trucks is another raw material
input. In addition to pulp mills, saw mills, plywood plants, and
similar facilities will have log or wood yards and use some of
the processes described below. </p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Log Yard Operations</strong> </p>
<p>The purpose of a log yard is to receive incoming logs and
chips, debark logs, chip logs, and store bark and chips. Logs,
chips, and bark are delivered by truck and rail. These materials
are stored in stacks or piles. Logs are handled either by
rail-mounted cranes or large wheeled log trucks. Logs and chips
are stored by using some inventory management program to reduce
weathering and spoiling. </p>
<p><strong>Specific Causes of Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bark and Chip Contamination</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Bark and wood chips that become mixed with soil cannot be used
for fuel or pulping. Both materials fall from the margins of
piles and become soiled. Additional bark falls from logs prior to
debarking as a result of handling. All log yards are outside
facilities. Some are partially or completely paved. Others are
completely unpaved. Soil that becomes mixed with chips and bark
comes from exposed soil in the log yard. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Over-sized Logs</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Oversized logs are logs that are too large to be debarked or
chipped by mill equipment. The material is delivered to mill log
yards by truck and rail. Delivery of oversized logs is caused by
a lack of incoming material inspection. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Metal-containing Logs</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Metal-containing logs have nails or wire imbedded in the logs.
The metal may not be visible, but is detected electronically on
the chipper or debarking decks. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Woody Debris and Soil</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Undersized limbs and other debris such as soil and sand are
delivered attached to logs or trapped between logs. Soil and sand
is also delivered with bark and wood chips that are manufactured
offsite. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Decay</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Various molds damage logs and chips. The length of time stored
as well as weather conditions contribute to mold growth. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Poor Log Yard Layout </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Fuel usage can be significant. In one logyard that was handled
entirely by log trucks, an estimate of the miles traveled
annually by log trucks totaled 17,000 miles. The distance driven
contributes to fuel usage and maintenance costs. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Log Yard Delivery Specifications</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Oversized and undersized log disposal in landfills can be
reduced to near zero. Publishing of log size standards and
rigidly enforcing delivery standards will prevent delivery of
oversized logs. Incoming inspection of logs can prevent delivery
and disposal. Oversized logs that are delivered can be cut to
smaller size so as to fit in existing equipment or sold to
specialty lumber companies and mills that can accept larger logs. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purchase of Additional Chipping Equipment</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Undersized logs can be debarked and chipped. Debarkers are
advertised in trade magazines that can handle small and irregular
shapes. Once debarked, undersized logs can be chipped. Several
mills have purchased mobile chippers to handle this material. </p>
<p>Metal-containing logs were traditionally landfilled. Some
mills cut the metal-containing area from logs. The
metal-containing portion is landfilled; the metal-free portion is
debarked and chipped. There are chippers that can chip
metal-containing logs without damage. Metal, which is most often
steel, is magnetically separated. This material can then be used
a boiler fuel or chips for particleboard manufacture. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Paving and Improving Log Yards </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Paving log yards seem to be the best practice for reducing
soil contamination. Bark and chips that do fall onto the ground
will be less likely to become contaminated. Paved areas also
allow bark and chips to be collected for use. Maintenance costs
will probably decline for log yard trucks, debarkers, and
chipping equipment by preventing soil contamination. Log flumes
will also have reduced soil loading. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chip and Bark Cleaning</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Wood chips and bark that has become contaminated with soil can
be cleaned in vibratory screening systems. Several mills are
considering screening systems. The bark and chips would be used
as fuel after screening. Soil and fines can be used as landfill
cover or other soil use. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Log Yard Layout </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Fuel and truck maintenance costs can be reduced by designing
log yards to reduced distance driven. Time and material flow
studies are commonly conducted in manufacturing plants to reduce
fork truck travel and travel time. The same techniques and
benefits could be realized in log yards. </p>

<h3><a name="Lime"><strong>Lime Mud Waste Reduction</strong></a><strong> </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<p>Lime mud waste is directly related to lack of lime kiln
capacity. Some mills dispose of up to 200 tons per day. Lime mud
disposed of must be replaced by purchasing calcium oxide.
Disposal and purchase increase operating cost and fill landfills.
There is some offsite reuse of lime mud, but the majority is
disposed in landfills or storage lagoons. </p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Lime Kilns</strong> </p>
<p>Lime kilns are typically long rotating tubes where combustion
gasses and calcium carbonate pass through changing calcium
carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. Heat loss is great
since insulation is difficult to apply to the rotating housing.
Downtime is one reported additional problem. For various reasons
such as mechanical failure, kilns are often offline. Since pulp
mills operate continuously, lime mud produced during kiln
downtime is often landfilled. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Install Second or Larger Lime Kiln</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some mills have increase kiln capacity by adding second kilns.
In some cases, Georgia mills have reclaimed tons of lime mud
stored in treatment lagoons after adding kiln capacity. Kilns are
high cost devices. The economics of installing a new kiln are not
known. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vertical Kilns</strong><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>Vertical lime kilns can offer reduced down-time, improved
energy efficiency, and larger kiln capacity in a smaller
footprint area. Vertical kilns have not traditionally been used
due to some manufacturing limitations. A NICE3 grant was awarded
to Altex Incorporated to develop a vertical lime kiln; the pilot
plant tests are targeted to Weyerhaeuser's Flint River Plant in
Oglethorpe, Georgia. More information is contained in Appendix
II. </p>

<h3><a name="Energy"><strong>Energy Conservation and Recovery</strong></a><strong> </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Waste Generation</strong> </p>
<p>Energy is heavily used by the pulp and paper industry. Most
mills generate steam and electricity by burning black liquor,
coal, wood, and natural gas. Coal combustion is responsible for
much of the sulphuric acid and sulphur dioxide emissions reported
on the TRI. Additional expense to pulp mills in treating exhaust
stack emissions is also incurred. Ash is also a significant solid
waste stream and disposal problem when burning coal or wood
waste. </p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Energy Generation in Georgia Mills </strong></p>
<p>Mills typically burn wood both as an energy source and
disposal method to reduce volume. Mills that cannot meet their
energy needs from wood waste and black liquor combustion purchase
additional fuel in the form of wood, coal, bark, fuel oil, and
natural gas. Some mills have chosen to only burn wood since it is
a low sulphur fuel source. Many mills generate excess electricity
to sell back to utility companies or participate in the
utilities' power grid load management program. This can be a good
source of revenue for some mills. The majority of energy is used
to generate steam to heat water, processes, or generate
electricity. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Options </strong></p>
<p>Sulphur emissions and ash generation can be reduced by burning
less fuel. Less fuel will be burned if the energy demand of the
mill is reduced, and energy value of the fuel is maximized. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Water Usage Reduction</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Since water is generally heated prior to use in mill
operations, water usage reduction will reduce energy costs. If a
heated water flow at 180 F is reduced 100 gallons per minute, the
annual water reduction is 50,400,000 gallons. The energy
reduction assuming 65 F ambient is 46,368,000,000 BTU. Assuming
that water costs $2 per 1,000 gallons, water costs will reduce
$100,800. Energy costs will reduce $289,336 assuming an energy
cost of $6.24 per million BTU. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Thermal Energy Recovery</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Energy demand can be lowered in pulp and paper mills by
capturing and reusing waste heat. Energy lost through cooling
towers, exhaust stacks, wastewater, and product can all be
recovered for reuse. Heat recovery and utilization opportunities
vary at each mill depending upon the mill age and layout. One
mill in Georgia has identified several recovery opportunities. In
this one mill specific example, recovery of heat from wastewater
by installing liquid-to-liquid heat exchangers to heat incoming
process water was estimated to cost approximately $1 million for
installation with a payback of less than two years. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Efficiency</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Energy requirements can be lowered by using more efficient
equipment such as high efficiency electric motors or by
redesigning processes. For example, energy required for drying
can be reduced by decreasing water content of pulp before drying. </p>
<p><strong>Pollution Prevention Recommendations for Reducing
Energy Usage</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Conduct Energy Audits</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>A complete energy assessment should be conducted at each
facility to identify opportunities. Oglethorpe Power and Georgia
Power, the primary suppliers of electricity in Georgia, both will
conduct very thorough audits complete with recommendations and
cost / benefit estimates. The Energy Analysis and Diagnostic
Center (EADC) of Georgia Tech's Economic Development Institute
also performs advanced energy audits. EADC can be contacted by
calling (404) 894-3844. Some of the common opportunities
identified through audits are: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Replacing cooling towers with heat exchanger loops to
        heat supply water. </li>
    <li>Recovery of steam condensate. </li>
    <li>Recovery of &quot;low grade&quot; heat from hoods, vents,
        and waste water. </li>
</ul>
<p>Specific recommendations will vary at each mill location. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Fuel Storage </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The energy value of wood chips can be increased by decreasing
moisture content. Moisture content will increase in chips stored
in piles outdoors. Placing a cover over chip and bark fuel piles
is one method of reducing moisture, increasing energy value, and
decreasing decay. Mills will sometimes store pulp chips in silos;
this would be a good storage method for fuel as well. Turning
chip piles is another method of decreasing decay and moisture
content. Energy values can increase 10% or more by decreasing
moisture content, with a resulting 10% reduction of ash, fuel
demand, and some air emissions. </p>

<h3><a name="Needs">Pollution Prevention Assistance Needs of the
Georgia Pulp and Paper Manufacturing Sector</a> </h3>
<p><strong>Organizational Needs</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Education on the value of pollution prevention
        programs that provide for audits, waste cost accounting,
        and implementation of projects.</strong><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>This information may allow mills to upgrade existing outdated
technologies by proving or disproving cost effectiveness for
specific projects. Opportunities that are not obvious to mill
personnel can be identified by conducting audits. </p>
<p><strong>Technical Needs </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Information on leading industry and standard pulp
        and paper technologies. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mills are generally aware of the major technologies used by
the pulp industry. Specific information on the benefits of
specific technologies is still needed. Several mills indicated
that leading technologies such as belt washers and pressure
washers had been installed, but provided less than expected
performance. Technologies used by other industries for
maintenance cleaning and coating, or water filtration may be of
use to pulp and paper mills in replacing processes. Several
requests for this type of information were made by mill staff
during research for this paper. </p>
<p><strong>Technology Research Needs</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Research</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Basic research needs of the pulp and paper industry are being
met by various trade and educational institutions. Research
currently focuses on enzyme and catalytic augmentation of current
processes. Additional research involving zero-effluent mill
design is ongoing. Some industry experts predict that the next
century will bring totally biologic and enzymic pulping and
bleaching which will reduce energy and chemical use. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Applied Research</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Of greater interest to pulp and paper mills is bringing
current laboratory technology to the pulp mill. Enzymes,
catalysts, alternative bleaching, water reuse technology, and
advances in lime calcining are areas of applied research
interest. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Approaches">Approaches to Meeting Assistance Needs
of Georgia Pulp and Paper Manufacturers</a> </h3>
<p>The following section discusses how P<sup>2</sup>AD will meet
the pollution prevention needs of Georgia mills. </p>
<p><strong>Meeting Organizational Needs</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Provide Pollution Prevention Training </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Organization needs are primarily education and training of
mill management and production staff on the pollution prevention
techniques. The ultimate goal is to have each mill conduct
pollution prevention assessment, evaluate results, and implement
cost-effective solutions. Several Georgia mills and corporate
organizations do have working pollution prevention plans in
place. </p>
<p>Two roles that Georgia P<sup>2</sup>AD (in conjunction with
Georgia Tech, UGA, IPST, Herty Foundation, etc.) can play in pulp
and paper mill pollution prevention planning are to improve
awareness among mill personnel and to facilitate communication
between different pulp mills. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Facilitate Exchange of Information Between
        Manufacturers</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Facilitation can occur by identifying successful pollution
prevention programs in pulp mills and educating other mills of
success and opportunities identified. Publicizing successes
through published information and providing public forums for
information exchange are the methods that P<sup>2</sup>AD and its
partners can use. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Provide Experienced-based Training to Georgia
        Mills</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Teaching and training mill personnel by offering industry wide
and mill specific workshops are the suggested approaches for
providing general pollution prevention training. Specific
training on pollution prevention techniques applicable to a
particular mill process is also needed. In order to meet these
needs, P<sup>2</sup>AD and its partners must develop greater
expertise in pulp and paper mill processes. P<sup>2</sup>AD will
gain the needed expertise by participating in training offers
extended by some of Georgia's paper mills. Additional expertise
will be gained by conducting assessments with mill personnel at
Georgia facilities. Contacts made during the research for this
paper will likely lead to assessment opportunities. Training can
take place by attending courses and seminars offered by TAPPI and
other pulp and paper organizations. </p>
<p><strong>Meeting Technical Needs</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Publish Fact Sheets and Case Studies on New and
        Standard Technologies</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Technical needs are primarily information on new technologies
as well as information on industry standard technologies for
reducing waste and cost. Fact sheets providing general
information on new technologies can be developed and can include
enzyme, catalytic, and ozone processes. Case studies of
implementation of mill standard technologies can be developed
also and can include continuous digestion, belt washing,
diffusion washing, extended delignification, oxygen
delignification, and other mill processes. This information can
also be presented in public forums at technology conferences.
Cost reduction is perhaps the key issue when presenting case
studies. </p>
<p><strong>Meeting Research Needs </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Existing Research Resources </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD can aid in meeting applied research needs by
encouraging the use of existing state resources such as IPST,
Herty Foundation, and the research pulp mill at the University of
Georgia. The NICE3 project with Weyerhaeuser and Altex is one
such applied research project. Results of this project and other
paper industry related projects will be provided to Georgia mills
through fact sheets and workshops. P<sup>2</sup>AD will
investigate state and national resources for pilot studies in
pulping, bleaching, and paper making. This information can be
distributed through fact sheets and workshops. </p>
<p>Any new or existing basic research needs can be identified
though mill and corporate contact. P<sup>2</sup>AD will attempt
to find existing research programs addressing a particular need.
If research is not ongoing, contacts can be made at various
educational and industry organizations to determine a course of
action. This may include finding researchers with appropriate
expertise, additional industries interesting in funding research,
and other financial assistance sources. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Conclusion">Summary and Conclusion </a></h3>
<p>The purpose of this study is to identify the pollution
prevention needs of the Georgia pulp and paper industry. This
information will be used to develop programs within P<sup>2</sup>AD
or through partners to address industry needs. Some of the needs
and methods of meeting needs are listed below. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Significant opportunity does exist within Georgia pulp
        and paper manufacturers to reduce waste. Waste reduction
        has been accomplished at several mills by implementing
        pollution prevention programs to identify opportunities
        and implement cost-effective solutions. P<sup>2</sup>AD
        can provide the greatest assistance by facilitating the
        development of programs in all mills. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Georgia mills need information to replace existing
        processes with more efficient technology. P<sup>2</sup>AD
        can assist by developing case studies for various mill
        standard and cutting edge technologies. Mills can also
        benefit by learning of technologies used by other
        manufacturing sectors to reduce waste from maintenance
        and other non-process related operations. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Applied research is needed to industrialized new
        technologies. P<sup>2</sup>AD can educate mills on
        various applied research projects and resources in
        Georgia and nationally. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>New basic research needs probably exist concerning such
        issues as enzyme use. These issues will be identified
        through discussions with mill, corporate, trade, and
        research organizations. P<sup>2</sup>AD can assist in
        matching research needs with the appropriate technical
        and financial resources. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>P<sup>2</sup>AD will continue to seek educational
        resources for P<sup>2</sup>AD and partner organization
        staff with the goal of becoming well informed on pulp and
        paper mill industrial practices. P<sup>2</sup>AD cannot
        provide adequate assistance to Georgia mills without
        achieving a high level of expertise in pulp and paper
        technologies. </li>

<h3 align="center"><a name="APPENDIX I">APPENDIX I</a> </h3>
<p align="center"><strong>AN APPROACH TO SOLID WASTE MINIMIZATION
IN THE PAPER INDUSTRY </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Manfred K. Buder, Solid Waste
Minimization Project Manager Weyerhaeuser Company - Tacoma,
Washington</strong> </p>
<p>Since the late 1980s the paper industry has written numerous
success stories in the reduction of the solid waste it generates
and disposes. According to a survey by NCASI (National Council
for Air and Stream Improvement), in 1989, the industry generated
over 13 million tons of process wastes, nearly all of which were
land filled. Most of this waste consists of effluent treatment
solids (&quot;sludge&quot;), boiler ash, lime wastes, and wood
debris. In recent years the industry has made inroads in shifting
much of these residuals to useful alternative practices, such as
energy recovery and land application. </p>
<p>Weyerhaeuser Company ascribes to an integrated approach for
managing the solid wastes from its manufacturing facilities. This
means the coordination of a &quot;full tool kit&quot; of waste
management options and their implementation across all of
Weyerhaeuser's facilities. A key part of this strategy is to make
progress in reducing the generation of and finding beneficial
uses for these solid residual streams. There are five key drivers
for the company's waste minimization effort: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Environmental protection and tightening regulations </li>
    <li>Stakeholder expectations </li>
    <li>Company policy to conserve resources and minimize waste </li>
    <li>Landfill depletion and high replacement costs </li>
    <li>Economic benefits: avoided disposal cost and material
        recovery credits. </li>
</ul>
<p>Accordingly, Weyerhaeuser's mills in Georgia have made and are
continuing endeavors to minimize their solid waste streams. The
Flint River pulp mill recycles scrap metal, office paper, and
aluminum cans. The mill has also made significant strides to
reduce fiber loss, thereby not only conserving raw materials, but
also decreasing the quantity of primary effluent treatment sludge
that needs to be dewatered and hauled to the landfill. Our
composite panels mill at Adel provides another example of solid
waste minimization. Instead of land filling its sanderdust waste,
the mill sells it to a Florida utility company that uses it for
fuel. Per unit of product, our sawmill at Barnesville landfills
less of its manufacturing wastes that any other Weyerhaeuser
sawmill. This is largely because of the mill's resolve to recycle
these residuals as raw materials for particleboard manufacture
(at Adel), for use by horticultural and landscaping companies, as
a fuel (both internally and at Flint River), and for other
beneficial uses. The Barnesville sawmill has also undertaken
pollution prevention measures to reduce its generation of log
yard waste to a level that is unmatched by similar mills within
the company. </p>
<p>In support of this companywide effort, a technical team from
the Corporate R&amp;D group has been charged with providing
assistance to Weyerhaeuser's pulp, paper, paperboard, and wood
products mills to minimize solid waste generation and disposal.
This Solid Waste Minimization (SWMin) Team works with the mills
and with sister entities at the corporate offices to obtain data,
evaluate solid waste reduction opportunities at mills, develop
mill SWMin plans, and stay abreast of pertinent technologies. At
the heart of the program for the past several years have been the
SWMin studies conducted at Weyerhaeuser manufacturing facilities.
The SWMin Team with the help of mill staff, obtains data on
recurring, non-hazardous solid waste streams, and assists the
mills in identifying and capturing significant waste reduction
and utilization opportunities. Since the onset of the decade,
SWMin studies have been completed for nearly all of the company's
thirteen pulp, paper, and paperboard manufacturing sites. In the
last couple of years Weyerhaeuser's SWMin Team has been busy
working with various wood products facilities. </p>
<p>SWMin is a seven-step process. The first step is the planning
and coordination of the study with the mill. Second, the SWMin
Team, typically two engineers and two technicians, conduct a
week-long onsite survey to identify waste steams and their
sources/destinations, glean facts and data, take samples, and
obtain ideas and other input from mill staff. In the third step,
the solid waste streams are screened down to a manageable number
of key streams for which various short- and long-term
minimization alternatives are identified. Three screening
criteria are used: annual disposal cost, annual recovered value
of the stream, and associated environmental issues. Also, at this
point in the process the SWMin Team surveys potential uses and
users for selected residual streams as a reality check against
some of the utilization alternatives being considered. In Step 4,
the most promising combinations of waste streams and minimization
alternatives are further developed and evaluated based on roughly
estimated life-cycle economics. The &quot;top&quot; economic
opportunities are ranked by their net present values and reported
to the mill. These opportunities are reviewed and revised, as
appropriate, with mill staff in the fifth step of the SWMin
process. The purpose of this step is to select a reduction
target, finalize the SWMin project roster, and develop a
five-year SWMin plan. Step 6 is the implementation of this plan
and Step 7 is the documentation of SWMin progress against the
plan. The SWMin Team is available to the mills for technical
support during the implementation and documentation phases. Of
course, since costs, markets, production, and other things do
change over time, it will be necessary to loop back and revisit
some earlier steps in the process from time to time. </p>
<p>Typically, 50 to 100 solid waste streams, some of them very
small on a relative scale, are identified at each company pulp
and paper mill. Most of these wastes end up being land filled,
usually onsite. Others are burned, typically in the power boiler,
or land applied. Secondary effluent treatment solids are
impounded in lagoons for the most part, since few company mills
use activated sludge treatment systems. Small, but growing,
quantities of the mills' solid residuals are recycled. </p>
<p>The largest solid waste categories being generated by the
mills are various woodwastes, boiler ash, effluent treatment
sludges (primary and secondary), recausticizing wastes (dregs,
grits, lime, etc.), and general mill trash. Minimization of these
types of streams is certainly challenging. As examples, the SWMin
team and Weyerhaeuser mills have evaluated, and in many cases
implemented, the following SWMin approaches: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Woodyard debris: (1) debris separation into hog fuel,
        rocks, and fines (soil supplement); and (2) woodyard
        paving.</li>
    <li>Boiler ash: (1) boiler upgrade to improve combustion
        efficiency, (2) flyash screening and char reinjection,
        and (3) ash utilization as a soil supplement or
        construction material. </li>
    <li>Primary sludge: (1) avoiding mixture of ash, line, and
        other separable streams flowing into the primary effluent
        treatment system, (2) spill and leak control, and (3)
        recovery of fiber for internal or external use, or for
        energy recovery as a fuel.</li>
    <li>Grits and dregs: (1) purchased lime quality control, and
        (2) washing and land application. </li>
</ul>
<p>Although there are similarities among mills, the SWMin Team
found the mills to be at different stages of waste management
along the hierarchy of alternatives (i.e., from disposal up
through recycling and source reduction). However, significant
opportunities exist for cost effective improvement at each
facility surveyed. One result of these studies has been to make
the mills more aware of the solid wastes they generate, must
manage, and can minimize through examination of the projected
economic benefit. The risk mitigation &quot;stick&quot; and
opportunity &quot;carrot&quot; are significant enough to
encourage the mills to place higher priority on tracking their
solid wastes and planning for their future reduction. It is
interesting to note that those Weyerhaeuser mills that have made
the greatest effort to improve and have realized the associated
benefits tend to be the strongest advocates for further SWMin
progress. </p>

<p>The following chart is designed to help establish a baseline
year for measuring reductions. Identify the waste streams that
your facility generates and establish production for the baseline
year. Not all facilities generate waste in each category.
Establish reduction goals, by percentage, for the following year
and for the long-term. The projected year for achieving the
long-term goals must be included.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 Facility waste stream and reduction goals chart.</strong></p>
<p>At top of the table, enter a baseline year (1995 or earlier).
For each type of waste (hazardous, wastewater, air emissions, and
solid waste), enter the following information:</p>
<p><em>Column 1</em> - No entry necessary.</p>
<p><em>Column 2</em> - Enter the source(s) of each type of waste
generated. If no waste of the type listed in column 1 is
generated, enter None and go to next row. Example sources include
painting and cleaning operations, materials past expiration date
for hazardous wastes, potable water or process water for
wastewater sources, boiler or paint booth for air emissions, and
pallets, scrap steel, office paper for solid waste sources. </p>
<p><em>Column 3</em> - Enter the total amount of waste generated
in the baseline year for each category of waste. Use units of
pounds for hazardous waste and air emissions, gallons for
wastewater, and tons for total solid waste.</p>
<p><em>Column 4 </em>- Enter baseline year production in specific
units. Product quantities or dollar values are preferred. Example
units include automobiles, linear feet of pipe, number of
employees, annual sales, gallons of cleaning chemicals. Beyond
the entry level, production numbers will be used to normalize
waste reduction percentages based on production levels.</p>
<p><em>Column 5</em> - For each category of waste, enter your
reduction goal for calendar year 1996 versus your waste
generation in the baseline year. </p>
<p>1996 Reduction goal = (1996 waste generation/Baseline year
waste generation)x 100 (%) </p>
<p><em>Column 6</em> - For each category of waste, enter your
long term reduction goal versus your waste generation in the
baseline year. Also enter the year that you propose achieving
this goal by.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>MISSION STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Household Hazardous Waste Work Group</strong></p>
<p>Approximately 2.4 million households in Georgia generate more
than 5.1 million tons of solid waste each year, most of which is
disposed in solid waste landfills. Approximately 0.3 - 0.5
percent of that waste may be hazardous to human health or the
environment (EPA, Proceedings of the 4th National Conference on
Household Hazardous Waste Management, February 1990). In
addition, an unknown quantity of household hazardous waste is
improperly disposed of by pouring into storm drains, dumping on
the ground, etc. A mission of the Pollution Prevention Assistance
Division (P<sup>2</sup>AD) of the Georgia Department of Natural
Resources is to instill within the public a pollution prevention
ethic which is consistent with the protection of human health and
the environment. While hazardous waste generated by households is
exempt from environmental regulations in Georgia, the issue of
how best to properly manage household hazardous products and
reduce waste is of growing concern. Household hazardous wastes of
concern are unused or contaminated consumer products such as
paints, stains, and varnishes; cleaners; pesticides, fungicides,
and herbicides; solvents; used motor oil and other automotive
fluids; and, spent household batteries.</p>
<p>The mission of the Household Hazardous Waste Work Group is to
provide the Director of P<sup>2</sup>AD with recommendations on
the feasibility of a state-sponsored program which will result in
a reduction in household hazardous waste generation in Georgia.
If it recommends that a state-sponsored program should be
established, the Work Group shall propose a list of programs and
activities. Recommendations should include the approximate cost
of implementation. Recommendations made by the work group are
non-binding. To accomplish its mission, the Work Group should
review household hazardous waste reduction and management
programs in other states, evaluate the body of literature on the
subject, and solicit public opinion and comment.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The Household Hazardous Waste Work Group was created by the
Director of the Pollution Prevention Assistance Division of the
Georgia Department of Natural Resources to recommend guidelines
for a state-sponsored Household Hazardous Waste Prevention and
Management (HHWPM) program. The work group acted in an advisory
capacity to the Director.</p>
<p>The work group's mission was to provide to the Director
recommendations on the feasibility of a state-sponsored program
which will result in a reduction in household hazardous waste
(HHW) generation in the state. The work group was asked to review
HHW reduction and management programs in other states and to
evaluate the body of literature on the subject. The work group
was also to recommend a list of actions and activities that could
potentially constitute the development of a state HHWPM program.</p>
<p>To accomplish its mission, the work group was divided into
three smaller study groups. The Issues &amp; Priorities group
focused on the issues of liability, effect of regulations, and
possible funding sources for a state-sponsored HHWPM program. The
Residuals Management group discussed management strategy for HHW
once it enters the waste stream, while the Source Reduction group
focused on education programs for consumers to reduce the amount
of household hazardous products (HHP) entering the waste stream.
These three study groups met a total of nine times over a three
month period. Additionally, the total work group met three times,
and the chair and study group chairs met twice as a small group. </p>
<p>The work group was made up of 15 citizens representing a cross
section of government, trade associations, and environmental
groups. The work group members were Thea Powell, Chair; Rick
Foote, Vice-Chair; Don Cargill, Lynn Cobb, Ric Cobb, Rick
Cothran, Mark Eisen, Steve Emmons, Olin Ivey, Linda Jones, Kathy
Kuzava, Carol Monell, Reuben Sherrill, Susan Varlamoff, and Dee
West.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>September 22, 1995</strong></p>
<p>An overarching recommendation of the work group is that the
Pollution Prevention Assistance Division should be given
responsibility to serve as the lead organization in the state for
household hazardous waste (HHW) matters. The Division should
serve as a state-wide information clearinghouse and coordination
center for HHW, although it should not directly operate HHW
programs. The Division's programs should clearly emphasize the
difference between household hazardous products (HHP) and HHW.
Once the consumer no longer has a need for the product, then it
becomes a waste. Additionally, the Division should adopt the EPA
definition of household hazardous waste, as follows: HHW is A.
generated by individuals on the premises of a residence for
individuals and composed primarily of materials found in the
wastes generated by consumers in their homes, and B. Listed as
hazardous waste in 40 CFR, Parts 261.33 (e) or (f), or hazardous
by characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity,
and/or extraction procedure toxicity.</p>
<p>The HHW Work Group recommends the following, in no particular
order, to be components of the HHW program developed by the
Division.</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 1 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote
legislation to establish a HHW prevention and management program
in Georgia.</h4>
<p>Item # 1 </p>
<p>The Division should promote legislation that will create a
fund to provide financial support to local governments and other
groups in the state who wish to sponsor HHWPM programs. The
funding sources could be any one or a combination of the
following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>landfill tipping fees</li>
    <li>percentage of waste facility receipts </li>
    <li>hazardous waste generator fees</li>
    <li>local government surcharge, i.e. surcharge on water/sewer
        bills</li>
    <li>local government revenue surcharge on selected household
        hazardous products </li>
    <li>donated services.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Division should establish written criteria for grant funds
in support of HHWPM programs. These criteria should encourage the
creation of public/private partnerships, and allow for funds to
be used for stand alone education programs or comprehensive
education/collection programs.</p>
<p>Item # 2</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote legislation that would
encourage inclusion of questions regarding proper HHW
disposal/recycling practices on various types of licensing
renewals in Georgia. For example, a question about used motor oil
recycling could be included on drivers' license renewal forms.</p>
<p>Item # 3</p>
<p>The Division should conduct further investigation into other
state or federal laws regarding labeling of hazardous household
products. The work group agrees that manufacturers are more
likely to respond to a &quot;carrot&quot; rather than a
&quot;stick&quot; approach. Therefore, P<sup>2</sup>AD should
monitor developments regarding labeling laws, and should work
with other states and the EPA Labeling Task Force to encourage
appropriate labeling legislation.</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 2 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop
guidelines for conducting Household Hazardous Waste Prevention
and Management programs.</h4>
<p>These guidelines could be in the form of a document designed
as a comprehensive guidebook for distribution to any organization
interested in sponsoring HHWPM educational and/or collection
programs. The guidebook should recognize that public, private,
and non-profit organizations are capable of sponsoring HHWPM
programs; however, special consideration should be given to
programs that are sponsored or co-sponsored by private entities.</p>
<p>The guidebook should provide, but not be limited to the
following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Approved list of technical and education resources about
        household hazardous products and waste</li>
    <li>Liability issues for consideration before implementation</li>
    <li>Priority listing of HHW based on toxicity and economics
        of collection</li>
    <li>Guidelines and recommendations for various HHWPM programs
        - i.e., implementing an education program, and holding a
        materials exchange in conjunction with a collection
        event.</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff should be trained as a resource to work with
organizations as they use the guidebook to establish HHWPM
programs.</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 3 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote pollution
prevention of HHW through education of the public with a variety
of programs.</h4>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop targeted educational materials
through a variety of media, including: TV public service
announcements; radio spots; newspaper ads; distribution of
materials through the local Clean &amp; Beautiful chapters,
Cooperative Extension Service, and other applicable networks;
fact sheets; press releases; and/or flyers. All materials should
emphasize source reduction as the preferred management option for
HHW. Educational materials designed for teachers to incorporate
into their existing curricula should also be developed.</p>
<p>Consumer-oriented materials should educate buyers on the
environmental effects of HHP and the importance of purchasing
only the quantity needed. If disposal is required then emphasis
is placed on the most environmentally appropriate method. The
Division should be involved in educating the manufacturer,
consumer, and retailer about life-cycle analysis of products.
Additionally, the Division should do more study and have more
dialog with target audiences regarding life-cycle analysis and
other issues regarding HHW that are heavily affected by
manufacturers' attitudes and business pressures, such as
labeling, packaging, etc.</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 4 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should (as funds are
available) fund several pilot HHW collection programs in the
state.</h4>
<p>The work group agreed that collection is an important part of
HHW management, but it is desirable to gather some limited data
on collection in Georgia prior to making any decisions regarding
funding for a full-scale collection program. Division-approved
pilot programs should be located in several different areas of
the state, with an emphasis on events that can provide
information to the state regarding the feasibility of varying
types of collection events (urban vs. rural areas, types of
materials collected, etc.).</p>
<h4>Recommendation # 5 - P<sup>2</sup>AD should create and/or
promote collection for certain HHW items.</h4>
<p>Item #1</p>
<p>Citizens should be encouraged to follow the waste management
hierarchy: Purchase only what is needed, and use up all of the
product to avoid the need for recycling or disposal. Collection
and disposal of HHW items should be limited to those items that
cannot be donated, recycled, recovered, or safely disposed of in
a municipal landfill or down the drain. These items include
banned pesticides, oil-based paints and paints containing heavy
metals, wood preservatives, dioxins, and pool chemicals.</p>
<p>Item #2</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should promote and support private sector
efforts by retailers, manufacturers, and other stakeholders for
proper recycling or energy recovery of certain items, such as
motor oil, antifreeze, brake fluid, oil filters, latex paint,
solvents, paint thinners, strippers, non-alkaline household
batteries, fluorescent light bulbs, and thermometers. As these
private sector efforts will be impacted by EPA's Universal Waste
Rule, the Division should be involved in the planning process for
state authorization of that Rule.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>MISSION STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Recognition Criteria Work Group </strong></p>
<p>The Pollution Prevention Assistance Division (P<sup>2</sup>AD)
of the Department of Natural Resources was created to develop
programs and activities which encourage Georgia industries to
implement sound pollution prevention programs. P<sup>2</sup>AD's
legislation establishes that participation by industry in the
Division's programs and activities is to be voluntary, and that
proprietary information and reports developed for industry will
remain confidential.</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD has learned that industry considers many
pollution control and other regulations to be a disincentive to
voluntary pollution prevention, and that awards and recognition
are incentives.</p>
<p>The mission of the Recognition Criteria Work Group (RCWG) is
to develop and recommend to the Director of P<sup>2</sup>AD
pollution prevention recognition criteria. Specifically, the work
group is to: 1) develop criteria by which a company would be
judged to have achieved a level of excellence in the development
and implementation of pollution prevention programs which would
qualify the company for a &quot;Certificate of Excellence&quot;;
2) develop criteria by which a company would be judged to have
achieved a greater level of excellence which would qualify the
company for a &quot;Governor's Award&quot;; and 3) develop both
performance criteria for rating a pollution prevention program
and a process through which the Director can request that EPA
and/or EPD reduce regulatory monitoring and reporting
requirements of a company which can verify, by independent
review, achievement of the required level of performance in
pollution prevention. </p>
<p>The above criteria can be qualitative and/or quantitative, the
same or different for each mission objective.</p>
<p>The work group is requested to review current literature on
OSHA and EPA recognition programs, work of the National Academy
of Standards, and other states' programs. The work group is
further requested to solicit and consider public input. The first
task to be completed by the work group is a work plan and
schedule.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee Thomas of Georgia Pacific, Inc. is to serve as chair
of the RCWG. Peter Bonacum, Roy Bowen, Steve O'Day, Elizabeth
Brock, Win Hill, Bob Woodall, Laurie Fowler, David Word, Rep.
Denny Dobbs, Carol Foley, Pete Howard, Bruce Miller, and Wesley
Wolff are to serve as members.</p>
<p>The work group is created by the Director of P<sup>2</sup>AD,
and is advisory to the Director. The work group is to dissolve
upon completion of its mission.</p>
<p>Bill Wells, P<sup>2</sup>AD's Public Information Director,
will serve as principal staff support to the work group and as
liaison for the Director. </p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The Recognition Criteria Work Group was created by the
Director of the Pollution Prevention Assistance Division of the
Department of Natural Resources to recommend guidelines for a
state-sponsored pollution prevention recognition program. The
work group acts in an advisory capacity to the Director.</p>
<p>The work group's mission was to recommend criteria by which a
company would be judged to have achieved a level of excellence in
the development and implementation of pollution prevention
programs. The work group was to recommend criteria by which a
company could qualify for a &quot;Governor's Award.&quot; The
work group was also to recommend a process by which the Director
can request that EPD reduce regulatory monitoring and reporting
requirements of those companies which have achieved a required
level of performance in pollution prevention and maintained
compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations.</p>
<p>To accomplish its mission, the work group held three meetings.
The members reviewed pollution prevention recognition programs in
other states, recognition programs of federal agencies, existing
pollution prevention/environmental reporting requirements in
Georgia, and components of a successful pollution prevention
program.</p>
<p>The work group was made up of 14 citizens representing a cross
section of industry, government and environmental groups. The
work group members are Lee Thomas, Chairman; Peter Bonacum, Roy
Bowen, Elizabeth Brock, Rep. Denny Dobbs, Laurie Fowler, Carol
Foley, Win Hill, Pete Howard, Bruce Miller, Steve O'Day, Wesley
Wolff, Bob Woodall and David Word.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
<p>The Recognition Criteria Work Group recommends that the
Pollution Prevention Assistance Division establish a program for
recognizing and rewarding exemplary efforts in the area of
pollution prevention. The underlying objective of the program
should be to encourage pollution prevention in Georgia industries
by recognizing companies that successfully practice pollution
prevention. The recognition program should foster a common agenda
of preventing pollution and waste, increasing efficiency and
improving the environment.</p>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should work with the Georgia Legislature and
environmental regulators to create meaningful incentives for
companies which practice pollution prevention. However,
incentives would not lessen or interfere with environmental laws
or rules.</p>
<p>The recognition program should not be overburdensome. Whenever
possible, P<sup>2</sup>AD should use existing required
environmental reports as a basis for determining those eligible
for recognition. A company's environmental compliance history
should be considered during the recognition evaluation process.
The program should be at the facility level.</p>
<p>These recommendations should be used as a guide as P<sup>2</sup>AD
develops the requirements of the recognition program. P<sup>2</sup>AD
should continue to involve the public in the development of the
program. In order for the recognition program to become
successful and achieve its objective of encouraging pollution
prevention, it must be embraced by industry, government and the
general public.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>CATEGORIES OF AWARDS</strong></p>
<p>The Recognition Criteria Work Group recommends the formation
of two categories of recognition: a certification program and the
Governor's Award. The certification program should recognize and
reward continuous performance and improvement. It should have
three levels of recognition based on performance and
accomplishment and be measured against criteria developed by P<sup>2</sup>AD.
The three levels in order of increased achievement are: entry,
achievement, and model. Each level would have its own specific
criteria defined by P<sup>2</sup>AD.</p>
<p>At every stage of certification, P<sup>2</sup>AD should, in
consultation with EPD, develop criteria which would establish
that the applicant company is in environmental compliance. A
company must participate in the certification program to be
eligible to participate in the Governor's Award program. The
Governor's Award program recognizes outstanding pollution
prevention projects by a company, individual, organization,
academia, or a government agency. Unlike the certification
program, the Governor's Award should be competitive.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>CERTIFICATION PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p>The certification program is comprised of three levels. Each
level is based on a company's level of commitment to, and
achievement in the area of pollution prevention. The first level
is the Entry Level. In order to be recognized as an Entry Level
participant, a company must meet certain criteria that
demonstrate their interest in, and commitment to, developing a
pollution prevention program. These criteria include the
following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An employee awareness program </li>
    <li>A clear understanding of pollution prevention </li>
    <li>Management and employee commitment </li>
    <li>Established pollution prevention goals </li>
</ul>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop a mechanism which would allow
it to determine if an applicant meets the above criteria and is
in compliance with all federal, state and local environmental
laws and regulations. Certification in the Entry Level program
would be renewable annually based on sustained performance.</p>
<p>The Achievement Level is the second level in the certification
program. The Achievement Level is designed to recognize companies
that have implemented a pollution prevention program. Companies
which obtain the Achievement Level incorporate pollution
prevention into their business activities and can demonstrate
commitment on the part of management to encourage pollution
prevention practices outside the company. A company must have
participated in the Entry Level for at least one year to be
eligible to apply for the Achievement Level. The criteria for the
Achievement Level includes the following in addition to the
criteria for the Entry Level:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Documented reductions of emissions and waste through
        pollution prevention. </li>
    <li>Accounting for all costs and benefits of the company's
        pollution prevention program. </li>
    <li>Reduced and/or more efficient use of resources. </li>
    <li>A community involvement/outreach program. </li>
</ul>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop a mechanism which will allow it
to determine if an applicant meets the above criteria and is in
compliance with all federal, state and local environmental laws
and regulations. Certification in the Achievement Level program
would be renewable annually based on sustained performance.</p>
<p>The Model Level, the third level of the certification program,
is the highest level of achievement. Companies in this category
are considered best-in-class facilities that have exemplary
pollution prevention programs and are recognized as industry
leaders and environmental stewards within their community. To
these companies pollution prevention is not just a commitment but
a practice which is incorporated into all business decisions.
Model Level participants not only instill the pollution
prevention ethic in their employees and vendors, but encourage
others in the community or their industry to incorporate
pollution prevention practices into their daily activities. After
two years at the Achievement Level, a company is eligible to
apply for the Model Level. In addition to meeting the criteria of
the Entry Level and Achievement Level, Model Level candidates
must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Foster a pollution prevention ethic that extends outside
        the boundaries of the company or facility. </li>
    <li>Employ practices that prevent the transfer of pollution
        to other facilities. </li>
    <li>Serve as a witness for pollution prevention practices to
        peers and the public. </li>
    <li>Assist other companies through pollution prevention
        technology transfer. </li>
    <li>Demonstrate a commitment to pollution prevention in
        product development and purchasing decisions. </li>
</ul>
<p>P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop a mechanism which will allow it
to determine if an applicant meets the above criteria and is in
compliance with all federal, state and local environmental laws
and regulations. Certification in the Model program would be
renewable annually based on sustained performance.</p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Application Process</u></strong></p>
<p>Applications for the certification program should be accepted
year round. After receiving the application, the staff should
determine if the company meets the established criteria. Upon
approval, the company's compliance history should be reviewed.
Companies which have favorable compliance histories will receive
a letter announcing their acceptance in the certification
program. </p>
<p>Any company not wishing to continue to participate in the
program may withdraw. </p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Qualifications</u></strong></p>
<p>The certification program is open to any company that is
located in Georgia. A company or organization interested in
participating should submit an application. A company or
organization could be nominated by another party. Pollution
prevention projects and programs should address all media types
(i.e., air, solid waste, water). </p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Forms of Recognition</u></strong></p>
<p>Companies that achieve certification should be publicly
recognized. P<sup>2</sup>AD should develop a method for informing
the public of the certified company's achievement. Companies that
reach the Achievement Level or Model Level should be eligible for
some type of regulatory and/or financial incentives in the form
of reduced fees, expedited permitting or reduced reporting or
inspections. P<sup>2</sup>AD should consult with EPD to develop
regulatory incentives. If necessary, P<sup>2</sup>AD and EPD
should propose legislation to provide for regulatory incentives.</p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><strong>GOVERNOR'S AWARD PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p>The Governor's Award for pollution prevention should recognize
special and significant pollution prevention achievements of
companies and organizations in Georgia.</p>
<p>The Governor's Award unlike the certification recognition
program should be an annual competitive award given to a company,
individual, or organization that has demonstrated excellence in
pollution prevention. A company should have participated in the
certification program at some level to be eligible for the annual
Governor's Award. This criteria would not apply to individuals,
academia, non-profit organizations or government. The award
should be presented in three categories. These categories should
be small and medium business, large business, and community
(private/individual/organization/government). There should be no
limits on the number of honorable mention certificates presented.</p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Application Process</u></strong></p>
<p>The application process for the Governor's Award should be
similar to that of the certification recognition program. The
first step should be a screening of all applicants to eliminate
those which are not eligible. P<sup>2</sup>AD should also review
the applicant's compliance history where applicable. Qualified
applications should be judged by a panel of judges including
industry peers and representatives from relevant state agencies
and universities. </p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Qualifications</u></strong></p>
<p>All eligible projects should have occurred during the calendar
year; or in the case of ongoing programs, new activities should
have occurred during the calendar year. Prior recipients are
eligible to compete for the Governor's Award the following year,
although the project must differ from the previous entry. Only
those companies who participate in the certification program
should be eligible for the Governor's Award. This would not apply
to individuals, academia, non-profit organizations or government.</p>
<p>Reductions that are the result of a process being eliminated
or transferred to another facility out of state should not
qualify as pollution prevention activities.</p>
<p>&#160;<strong><u>Forms of Recognition</u></strong></p>
<p>The principal award in the Governor's Award program should be
public recognition. The award should be presented to the company
by the Governor at an annual event.</p>

Wood Finishers and Furniture Manufacturers Encouraged to Attend Teleconference and Workshop<br>
<br>
<br>
Atlanta, Georgia - A teleconference and workshop will be held September 18, 1996, at the Environmental Protection Division 
Training Center in Atlanta. This day long teleconference and workshop will help wood furniture manufacturers and cabinet 
makers understand what they must do to satisfy new requirements under the Clean Air Act. Most furniture manufacturers, 
regardless of size, are affected by these new requirements and are encouraged to attend.<br>
<br>
The speakers will be from various industry and state programs. Some questions they will answer during the program include: 
Who is affected? Who must control emissions? Who must keep records and reports? How can I identify pollution prevention 
techniques that will save money and reduce waste such as selecting the best spray paint gun and using good coating 
techniques?<br>
<br>
The program is free and sponsored locally by the Environmental Protection Division/Small Business Assistance Program, 
Pollution Prevention Assistance Division, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Southeastern Environmental Research 
Alliance. Other participants include the American Furniture Manufacturing Association, the Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturing 
Association, the Business and Industrial Furniture Manufacturing Association, the National Painting and Coating Association, 
the DeVilbiss Company, Sherwin-Williams Company, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). <br>
<br>
Georgia Tech will issue 0.8 Continuing Education Credits for full day attendees.<br>
<br>

<strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:</strong></h3>

<h3 align="center">GEORGIA EPD RELEASES<br>
1994 TOXIC RELEASE INVENTORY REPORT</h3>

<p align="left">April 19, 1996 - Atlanta, Georgia. The
Environmental Protection Division (EPD) of the Georgia Department
of Natural Resources has completed the 1994 Toxic Release
Inventory (TRI) report. This report contains information about
releases of certain toxic chemicals. Of the 344 chemicals and 22
compounds listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US
EPA) for inclusion in toxic release tracking, only 159 are found
at any of the 657 Georgia facilities reporting to EPD.<br>
Unlike previous years, the total number of pounds of toxic
chemicals released in Georgia increased in 1994. The overall
increase is only 3%, which does not bring the releases back up to
the level they were in 1992. The overall increase resulted from
an increase in stack emissions of 17%. This growth was due to
emission increases at 18 established facilities. There are three
reasons for the increases: (1) higher production at many
facilities because of the improving economy, (2) companies filing
forms for new chemicals for which they did not have to file in
previous years (some new chemicals are added to the TRI list each
year), and (3) the use of a new set of emission factors by paper
and pulp mills for estimating releases from their facilities.<br>
Despite the increase in total pounds of chemicals released, very
significant strides were made in improving the quality of air in
Georgia. Last year, EPD looked at each release in light of its
potential for harming the human population. This is done by
multiplying the pounds released for each chemical by a factor
based on how toxic that chemical is. This technique produces an
index which reflects both the amount released and the danger it
represents. This can only be done for those chemicals for which
there is enough information on toxicity. For Georgia, this could
be done for 1993 and 1994 for 27 chemicals. The sum or average of
those indexes can then be compared from one year to the next. The
sum or average for this year's indexes is only half of last
year's sum or average.</p>

<p align="left">The radical decrease in this toxicity index
resulted from voluntary reductions by industry of the two
chemicals which, based on the size of their index, should be of
the most concern to Georgia. The two chemicals are chloroform and
tricholoroethylene. Chloroform emissions were cut 50% since 1993,
primarily by substantial reduction of emissions of this chemical
at Georgia-Pacific's Brunswick plant and Stone Savannah River's
Pulp plant. There was also a 90% reduction in chloroform
emissions at ITT Rayonier. Decreases in trichloroethylene
emissions in Georgia resulted from reductions in emissions at
Lockheed Aeronautical Systems, Greenfield Industries, Grumman
Aircraft Systems, and Kato Spring of Georgia.<br>
The fact that the overall toxicity of the releases in Georgia
(for those chemicals for which it could be measured) decreased
dramatically , even though the total number of pounds released
went up, highlights one of the benefits of the TRI program. The
careful tracking of so many chemicals allows companies to make
decisions about their chemical usage so that they can prioritize
the most toxic emissions for reduction, instead of merely
counting the total number of pounds emitted from their
facilities.<br>

SECTIONS<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
</p>
<p>July 11, 1995<br>
60: 35,705<br>
264.314, 265.314<br>
Adds a test method to demonstrate that sorbents used to solidify
hazardous waste are non-biodegradable.<br>
December 11, 1995<br>
60: 63,431<br>
124 Subpart B, 124.31, 124.32, 124.33, 270.2, 270.14, 270.30,
270.62, 270.66<br>
Improves the permitting process for facilities that store, treat,
or dispose of hazardous wastes by providing earlier opportunities
for public involvement and expanding public access to information
throughout the permitting process and the operational lives of
hazardous waste facilities.<br>
</p>
<p>March 26, 1996<br>
61: 13,106<br>
261.4<br>
Corrects the text of a regulatory exclusion from the definition
of solid waste for recovered oil which is inserted into the
petroleum refining process. This corrected rule conditions the
exclusion of recovered oil on that oil being reinserted into the
petroleum refining process at a point where that process removes
or will remove at least some contaminants.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>EXHIBIT AA-1&quot; <br>
April 8, 1996<br>
61: 15,597 <br>
268 Subpart A, 268.1, 268.2, 268.3, 268.7, 268.8, 268.9,
268.10-.12, 268.39, 268.40, 268.42, 268.48, 268 Appendix XI<br>
Promulgates treatment stan-dards for hazardous wastes from the
production of carbamate pesticides and from primary aluminum
production under its Land Disposal Restriction program. It also
amends the treatment standards for hazardous wastes that exhibit
the characteristic of reactivity. This rule also begins the
process of amending existing treatment standards for wastewaters
which are hazardous because they display the characteristic of
ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity. These wastes
are sometimes treated in lagoons whose ultimate discharge is
regulated under the Clean Water Act, and sometimes injected into
deep wells which are regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act.
Prior to this rule, the treatment standards for these wastes
required only removal of the characteristic property. These
revised standards require treatment, not only to remove the
characteristic, but also to treat any underlying hazardous
constituents which may be present in the wastes, therefore,
minimizing threats from exposure to hazardous constituents which
may potentially migrate from these lagoons or wells. This rule
also codifies its existing Enforcement Policy that combustion of
inorganic wastes is an impermissible form of treatment because
hazardous constituents are being diluted rather than effectively
treated.<br>
</p>
<p>April 8, 1996 <br>
61: 15,662<br>
268 Subpart A, 268.1, 268.3, 268.39, 268.40<br>
Withdraws portions of revised treatment standards for hazardous
wastewaters that exhibit the characteristic of ignitability,
corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity. Withdraws provisions of the
Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act of 1996 which provides that
the wastes in question are no longer prohibited from land
disposal so long as they are not hazardous wastes at the point
they are land disposed. <br>
April 12, 1996<br>
61: 16,309<br>
261.6, 262.10, 262.53, 262.56, 262.58, 262 Subpart H, 262.80,
262.81, 262.82, 262.83, 262.84, 262.85, 262.86, 262.87, 262.88,
262.89, 263.10, 263.20, 264.12, 264.71, 265.12, 265.71, 266.70,
273.20, 273.40, 273.56, 273.70<br>
Modifies procedural controls governing the export and import of
hazardous waste. Harmonizes hazardous waste rules with new OECD
rules to increase efficiency. Identifies wastes under the
Resources Conservation and Recover Act (RCRA) subject to a
graduated system of procedural and substantive controls when they
move across national borders within the Organization for Economic
Development (OECD) for recovery. This rule seeks to prevent or
minimize the possibility of such wastes being abandoned or
otherwise illegally handled and applies only to exporters and
importers of RCRA hazardous wastes destined for recovery in OCED
countries (except for Canada and Mexico). <br>
<br>
April 30, 1996<br>
61: 19,117<br>
268, 268.39<br>
Corrects errors giving incorrect dates in the April 8, 1996 final
rule.<br>
</p>
<p>June 28, 1996 <br>
61: 33,682<br>
268 Subpart A, 268.1, 268.2, 268.3, 268.39, 268.40, 268.48<br>
Corrects technical errors in the April 8, 1996 final rule.<br>
August 26, 1996<br>
268 Subpart D, 268.40, 268.48<br>
Revises the carbamate waste treatment standards for one year by
allowing carbamate wastes to be treated either by any technology
which achieves the constituent concentration levels promulgated
in the Phase III rule, or by treatment technologies specified in
this final rule as alternative treatment standards. This rule
also suspends the requirement to treat carbamate waste
constituents when they are expected to be present in ignitable,
corrosive, reactive or toxic hazardous wastes as Aunderlying
hazardous constituents.@ EPA believes these temporary alternative
treatment standards will assure that carbamate wastes are
adequately treated prior to land disposal, while providing time
for analytic chemical standards to be developed.<br>
<br>
<br>
In addition to incorporating the above Federal Registers, Rule
391-3-11-.19 AStandards for Waste Mercury-Containing Lamps@ has
been added to give an alternative set of management standards to
waste mercury-containing lamps, in lieu of regulation under 40
CFR Parts 260-272. By adding these standards to our rules,
handlers and generators are encouraged to recycle rather than
dispose of waste mercury-containing lamps. Waste
mercury-containing lamps recycled in accordance with this rule
are exempted from most hazardous waste handling requirements.<br>
<br>
Mercury-containing lamps are defined as any type of high or low
pressure lighting device that is unprocessed, contains mercury
and generates light through the discharge of electricity either
directly or indirectly through a fluorescing coating. The term
waste mercury-containing lamp includes fluorescent lamps, mercury
lamps, metal halide lamps and high pressure sodium lamps.<br>
<br>
A mercury containing lamp becomes a waste on the date it is
discarded or is permanently removed from its fixture and can no
longer be used to provide lighting. </p>
